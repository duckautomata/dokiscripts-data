1
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,260
Hello everybody, hello, hello, and Drago, thank you so much
for the tour and he gives a thank you.

2
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Hello, hello, hello.

3
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,900
Welcome in!

4
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,480
Howdy, it's Dino time!

5
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,280
Go!

6
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,120
With my arms up.

7
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,340
Mubikor, thank you for the gifted!

8
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,220
Gau!

9
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,430
Gau!

10
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,250
Gau!

11
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,190
Minto soar!

12
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,410
Ha ha ha ha ha ha We...

13
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,770
We will build the world's greatest Jurassic Park, maybe.

14
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,390
There might be accidents.

15
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,170
We'll see.

16
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,870
If you guys like how I did the subtitles as classic anime
subtitle yellow, I mean, though, Ghostsaurus Rex.

17
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,850
This way, your initials are MG.

18
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,350
Oh, MG Rex!

19
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,490
Metal Gear Rex.

20
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,930
The Mintoaurus Rex is very...

21
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:14,610
very dangerous i can smell your fear i can smell you i can
see everything if you're still if you're moving i have x-ray

22
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,010
vision i can see through your clothes might want to get that
checked out

23
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:34,640
can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon stuck in
bed sick than listening to mint good Feel better.

24
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,420
No.

25
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,480
Thank you for the super top.

26
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
Feel better.

27
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,020
When did your love of dino start?

28
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,120
Was it the ride or just the love of dino's all kids have
that you never grew out of?

29
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,160
If it's the latter, same.

30
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:58,560
You know, it's kind of funny because, like, I didn't go
through a super dinosaur phase.

31
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,960
I went through an Egypt phase.

32
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,940
But, I've always had an interest in dynos.

33
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,340
Hmm.

34
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,780
And, I don't know what it was.

35
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,520
I think, like, it just kept growing.

36
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,560
I feel like I, I, I don't know.

37
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,760
Like, I would be like, yeah, dynos are cool.

38
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,960
I always love dynos.

39
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,240
But, like, now I feel like I've gotten really into them more
than I have before.

40
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,360
This should be a great time.

41
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,600
You're a clever girl after all.

42
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,760
I love Jurassic Park.

43
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,320
It's one of those movies that I feel like I watch almost
every time I'm on a plane.

44
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,200
Like a long plane ride I put on Jurassic Park.

45
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,140
Nightmare Grimm.

46
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,840
Welcome to a membership.

47
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Thank you.

48
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,520
Dinosaur.

49
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,740
Dinosaur.

50
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,900
Because I am a fossil.

51
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,220
You feel good about that one?

52
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
You say I like dinosaurs because I'm a fossil?

53
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,840
You feel good about that one?

54
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,400
You feel like a winner with that?

55
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
You think that was a swinging hit?

56
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,850
If you like Egypt, Time Lapse is a neat old point and click
puzzle game with an Egyptian section.

57
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,210
Uh-oh.

58
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,030
Well, I don't regret it.

59
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,970
I'm not a fossil because I'm ectoplasm.

61
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,170
That's like the opposite.

62
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,230
Fossils are hard and maybe brittle, depending on how they
are.

63
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,970
And I am not.

64
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,890
I'm goopy.

65
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,170
Do you ever watch Lamba Before Time?

66
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,490
Yes!

67
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,290
Yep, yep, yep.

68
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,290
I watched the lamb before time.

69
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,870
Yep, yep, yep.

70
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,910
Rinse, thanks.

71
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,930
Happy birthday.

72
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,690
I was wondering if you could cast me a good luck magic spell
for my upcoming dance performance.

73
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,810
More, more.

74
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,210
Good luck.

75
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,270
Be me.

76
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,250
What is my favorite?

77
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,370
favorite dinosaur.

78
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,070
Ankylosaurus.

79
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,970
Hot dog.

80
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,930
Hot dog indeed.

81
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,790
I like that guy.

82
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,290
He's played Age of Mythology.

83
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,590
That'd be neat for him.

84
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,250
Egypt lover.

85
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,030
You know, I only played the Age of Empires.

86
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,970
I did not play Age of Age of Mythology.

87
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,050
Not Iguanadan.

88
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,790
Believe it or not, Iguanadan is not my favorite.

89
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,490
Believe it or not.

90
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:16,470
I have like a, I actually have like a model kit of Anky Anky
and Joyer?

91
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,510
Yeah, an Anky What is, that's so Anky

92
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,330
Aoe Pro?

93
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,850
Definitely not a pro.

94
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,090
Age of Mythology.

95
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,710
That sounds, maybe we could try it though.

96
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,370
Aguanidons and Shambles?

97
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:46,230
Yeah, they are because the ride, I think the one ride that
we'll ever see ever that features an iguanodon is gone

98
00:11:46,230 --> 00:12:01,550
iguana gone uh every i feel i fear every other dinosaur ride
you're gonna get what triceratops stegosaurus t-rex

99
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:09,310
obviously but that's what i loved about the dinosaur ride
you got some dinosaurs that were not as popular i i learned

100
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:18,290
that the dinosaur uh the carnatoris is what used for that
movie the dinosaur movie apparently it's because jurassic

101
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:26,170
park was in its heyday around the time and when they made
the movie they were like we don't want to copy jurassic park

102
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:37,270
and do a t-rex so we're gonna go with the carnatoris instead
i like the carnator yeah the oversized carno yeah he's much

103
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:43,770
bigger no he has a special name it's like carnatoris florida
Oridius or something.

104
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,270
He was created especially for a dinosaur.

105
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,920
He's actually supposed to be a little guy.

106
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,580
He's supposed to be teeny tiny.

107
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,220
Not teeny tiny, but you know.

108
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,900
Yeah.

109
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
But today we're playing Jurassic Park.

110
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
Jurassic World Evolution.

111
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,900
I did talk about this game before on stream.

112
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,080
And I was questioning whether I should play it or not.

113
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,360
But, I read some more reviews and people were saying that
it's really, really good.

114
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,180
So, I'm excited to get into it.

115
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,620
I've never played any of the other Jurassic World games,
Jurassic World Evolution games.

116
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,640
So, I'm very excited.

117
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,780
Oh, Quinn!

118
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
Happy birthday!

119
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,200
It was my birthday yesterday and it was the first time I
ever said to Super Chat that was also to you.

120
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,180
I hope you have a great night.

121
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,200
You too!

122
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,020
I hope you had a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, excellent, amazing birthday!

123
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,760
Can't wait to see the Kettle Koalas.

124
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,260
V2!

125
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,300
Me too!

126
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,780
Today the news would like to know, what kind of dino are
you?

127
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes, we know your secret.

128
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
We know what's behind the V-Tuber.

129
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,880
There is nothing!

130
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,240
What?

131
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm no dino.

132
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Are you caught?

133
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,000
This isn't another old joke.

134
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,280
Jurassic World Evolution is kind of a mouthful to say.

135
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,940
It is.

136
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,160
J-W-E.

137
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:22,920
J-W-E.

138
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,520
J-W-E.

139
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,240
We're playing J-W.

140
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,020
Boomer Dino.

141
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,980
J-W.

142
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,100
Jwee 3.

143
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,640
Ever thought of playing Dino Crisis?

144
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,520
By the way, hi, Minto.

145
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,360
Hi, Eric!

146
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,840
I have thought of playing Time Crisis, but Dino Crisis might
be fun too.

147
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,100
Excited for your cons, Armito.

148
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,280
Since you're on a Dino kick, I'd recommend Nigel Marvin's
Prehistory Shows.

149
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:04,380
They're pretty outdated, but it's made up for the charm of a
British naturalist excitedly talking at CGI dinosaurs.

150
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,380
I do love silliness.

151
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,280
Sandbox is great.

152
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
Campaign really holds your hand.

153
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
I heard that, too, that it was a...

154
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:22,360
like super like i don't know i don't know what i wanted to
be a campaign or sandbox excited to see you play this if you

155
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,740
like this one you may be interested in prehistoric kingdom
it's still in early access but it looks like it's turning

156
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:36,240
out really awesome oh thank you deliran thank you this one
has all the good qo qo l stuff already that's why that's

157
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:46,080
also why i i chose this one instead of two a lot of people's
reviews were saying like oh this could this game could have

158
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:56,740
been a dlc for for domestic world evolution too but i i felt
looking into it a little bit more you know how sometimes

159
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:04,080
people will say that about a game like this could have been
a dlc to the first one but maybe they don't realize that

160
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:17,320
like some things were kind of rebuilt you know what i mean
like like not everything could be a dlc Sometimes games have

161
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,580
to be like, you know, like reprogrammed and things like
that.

162
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,760
Yeah, updated systems.

163
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, yeah, a different engine.

164
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,280
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

165
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,620
So, what?

166
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,420
Oh, what was it that?

167
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,340
Oh, there was a game, I feel.

168
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,120
That.

169
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,420
Oh, it wasn't a game.

170
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,140
No, um.

171
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,700
This happened, well, it's kind of different, but like...

172
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh, sorry, I'm talking about Miraculous Ladybug again.

173
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:03,300
But Miraculous Ladybug in the first couple of seasons looked
very different from how Miraculous Ladybug looks now.

174
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,300
And people kind of toss back and forth between which
animation style they like.

175
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,040
Not the Brazil DLC.

176
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:20,280
But they kind of talk about how they like the previous, or,
you know, some people like the new animation, some people

177
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,740
like the previous animation.

178
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,080
And you'll have the people that like the older animation to
be like, why did they have to change it, why, why?

179
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:35,660
And it's literally because the animation program that they
used, like, I don't remember if it got discontinued or if it

180
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,800
updated or something.

181
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,960
But they literally can't go back to the old style.

182
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:55,760
because um because it doesn't exist anymore yeah so it's
kind of you know they had to switch to unreal is that what

183
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,160
it was since dinosaurs had feathers have you ever wondered
if they were all puffy like owls and feathers didn't get

184
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:22,200
preserved like their skeletons I do wonder that right hmm
Ladybug season 3 could have been DLC So true And now that

185
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,360
Adobe anime was also going to be shut down Oh they
backtracked I heard about it getting shut down But I didn't

186
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,460
know That it backtracked Are you a new dino look denier?

187
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:50,420
No In fact I really like that I think it's really cool that
more technology comes out where we are able to get step by

188
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,160
step more and more accurate, potentially accurate
representations.

189
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,220
I think it's so cool.

190
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,560
Oh, and also, I mean, people have been saying that like
birds are descendants of dinosaurs forever, you know?

191
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,100
So it makes sense if they had feathers before.

192
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,320
Perhaps that's also why we can't at Sonic games, like
Unleash Your Generations anymore.

193
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,460
Who knows?

194
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,620
Who knows?

195
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,080
They are mini dinos.

196
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,340
Birds are so cute.

197
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,720
Birds aren't real, Minto.

198
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,380
They are.

199
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,600
They are in my heart.

200
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,220
Please.

201
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,040
To be more precise, birds are dinosaurs.

202
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:36,740
Yes.

203
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,740
Birds are dinosaurs.

204
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,460
But like...

205
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,740
What does that make like pterosaurs then?

206
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,880
I think about it because I'm like, you know, T-Rex can't
fly.

207
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,540
So it's just big birds.

208
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,880
But like, did they evolve from dinosaurs or terrors?

209
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,620
You know what I mean?

210
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,640
Like, I'm just like, I don't really know.

211
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:24,520
prove you're not a dinosaur we need to hear your best
attempt at a dinosaur cry oh actually you know what i love

212
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:35,060
actually i've one of my favorite overhaul or i guess like
you know the type the t-rex the like the the Jurassic Park

213
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:42,380
t-rex roar that you hear is not accurate you know how like
they've come to learn or i guess

214
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:54,020
deduced, hypothesized that that T-Rexes did not, did not
roar like they do in the movies.

215
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,520
No, no.

216
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:02,100
But the fact that they click, which is even scarier, they
kind of like, so scary.

217
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,420
Nothing in Jurassic Park is accurate.

218
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,440
Yeah, well, you know, a lot of people.

219
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,260
It's still like people's, when they think of a T-Rex, it's
like the T-Rex they think of.

220
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:31,810
you know so okay but let's i don't i didn't accept any of
this yet because i didn't know let's accept let's see

221
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:46,380
oh oh it just takes me to the main menu i thought it was
gonna be like a cutscene or something um

222
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,940
i still don't know if i want to i feel like campaign would
be fine to get me used to the controls, no?

223
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,640
So I'm okay, but...

224
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,820
Also...

225
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I want to create my own stuff.

226
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,300
I don't want them to be like, okay, now put this guy in
there, you know?

227
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,840
Does that mean T-Rexes are just bigger shoebill?

228
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,140
Oh, I need DMCA risk!

229
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,100
Oh my gosh, you guys, I need your opinion.

230
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,980
Okay, there is a streaming mode, right?

231
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,480
Mute, licensed music.

232
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,840
I have it on currently.

233
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,880
What?

234
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,340
I want to hear Jurassic Park theme!

235
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,720
What if I do it instead?

236
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,740
I don't remember, wait.

237
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,880
I wonder if it's playing it right now.

238
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,980
We're just missing it.

239
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,780
Will the Sandbox have a tutorial, I wonder?

240
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,080
Challenge.

241
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,120
Test your paleo-curation skills against a set of unique
challenges.

242
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,700
Oh, this version's way better.

243
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,180
You need a tutorial.

244
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,980
No, I agree.

245
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,220
I want a tutorial.

246
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,960
If I remember correctly, it does not.

247
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
Okay, we'll go to campaign then.

248
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,660
Maybe we do campaign today, and then whenever we come back
to Jui 3, we do a sandbox.

249
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,800
Life finds a way.

250
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,200
Genetic power.

251
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,360
It's him!

252
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,240
The most awesome force that the planet has ever seen.

253
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,820
With it, we diverted the very...

254
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:11,300
course of natural history we took something so far away in
time gold bloom and put it on display for the world to see

255
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:21,740
that's crazy they actually got him or worse or worse
sometimes though it really was a a compelling vision of

256
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:32,180
coexist moving in slow motion precious brief glimpses of
peace the non-streamer mod is instant Oh, boat is instant

257
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,760
DMCA.

258
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,100
No!

259
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,900
But when nature seemed to offer a correction, many people
saw only a tragedy.

260
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Greed saved the dinosaurs from the volcano.

261
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh, I forgot to do.

262
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,280
Oh, I forgot to do it.

263
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,120
But it was compassion.

264
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,680
That's my God.

265
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,320
Oh, with the horse.

266
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
What the horse doing there?

267
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,720
To spread into every corner of the planet.

268
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,060
Free him.

269
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:12,280
We need to find a way to coexist but can we put our hubris
aside and work with nature this time this time can we

270
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:25,020
finally allow life to find a way oh look at the little fear
he said the thing he said the thing he said the

271
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,510
It took me a second.

272
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,590
He said it.

273
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,830
We're in the Badlands.

274
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,370
Oh, yeah.

275
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,390
The Dinosaur Integration Network is hoping to gather support
of their goal of helping dinosaurs worldwide.

276
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,190
This historic patch of Badlands will be a showcase of what
the D-I-N-D.

277
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,210
Dinner.

278
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,450
Yummy.

279
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,950
You can't see it, but there's like a little loading dinosaur
right behind me.

280
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,030
chasing a goat.

281
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:11,810
If there's one thing that the history of evolution has
taught us, it's that life life will not be contained.

282
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,270
The game is not lagging.

283
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,590
I'm lagging.

284
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,790
Snake water.

285
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,990
Look how cute they are though.

286
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,650
Time and time again.

287
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,090
Tearing down barrier after barrier until finally...

288
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:36,450
Breaking bad plus dinosaur might be the best thing ever this
Jurassic world there is no path left to travel shaft tilt

289
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:47,150
finds away no viable option but coexistence with the
dinosaurs it's a rocky road ahead of us less rocky perhaps

290
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:58,710
under the right management oh my god they're so cute
Welcome!

291
00:26:59,910 --> 00:26:59,910
Welcome!

292
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,850
I am, of course, Cabot Finch.

293
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,950
Cabot Finch!

294
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,630
I might have to change some settings, guys, so I'd stop
lagging, so...

295
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,490
Any owner of this lovely patch of Badlands?

296
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,870
Go on!

297
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,210
Take a look around!

298
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,470
Breathe in the, uh... fresh hair!

299
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,490
Hmm.

300
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,450
Decidedly less, uh, less fresh around the herbivore
enclosure.

301
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,610
Hey, tell me, what are you calling this again?

302
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,090
Is it done?

303
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,230
Dim?

304
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,310
Din.

305
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,710
The dinosaur integration network.

306
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,430
I am Kira Chang.

307
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,050
A pleasure to meet you.

308
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,310
We intend to help dinosaurs and humans coexist globally.

309
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,490
And I am here to find clients who share that goal.

310
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:50,010
Hey, so I should, um, what, ignore the roaming velociraptors
that I saw on the way in and, and just focus on the bare

311
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,430
bones and closure?

312
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,930
Oh, is that okay?

313
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:53,790
Wow.

314
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,750
You're spoiling me.

315
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,150
at the site map.

316
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,150
Okay, one second.

317
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,290
I have an idea.

318
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,770
Everybody say goodbye to the Minto as you know.

319
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,590
Say goodbye.

320
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,160
Pew!

321
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,740
TV Minto!

322
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,820
TV Rinto is here to save the day!

323
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,620
Wait, am I...

324
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm still lagging.

325
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh, no!

326
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,140
Wait.

327
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,920
Uh...

328
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,580
Fine.

329
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,720
I think I am.

330
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,620
I'm gonna have to reduce the resolution.

331
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,680
Wait, actually, what is the resolution?

332
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,860
Oh, it won't let me.

333
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,920
What do I do, V-Sync on?

334
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,520
It won't let me change the frame rate.

335
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,980
You guys saw it was...

336
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,100
It was...

337
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,980
It's okay now, though.

338
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,980
We're all good.

339
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,480
Everything's fine.

340
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,360
I don't need to change it.

341
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,120
I know that, like, playing in window mode is not as good,
but for my setup, I...

342
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,220
I don't know, I just, I don't like, I don't like playing
full screen.

343
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,560
Search for a dino hoodie asset for TB models, I know!

344
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,820
But this is all, do whatever, we got it working.

345
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Where are the velociraptors?

346
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,260
Okay, so what am I doing?

347
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,520
Open the site map.

348
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,110
Baby!

349
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,570
Oh my god, I can hear them stepping!

350
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,450
Wait, how do I get out of you?

351
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,350
Oh, okay.

352
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,890
So cute.

353
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,830
Nobody's even looking at them.

354
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,110
Nobody's stopping and being so enthralled.

355
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,270
Oh, there they go.

356
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,490
Yes, yes, go into the viewing gallery.

357
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,970
Yes, yes!

358
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,990
Yes!

359
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,830
Viewing gallery one.

360
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,710
Okay, site map.

361
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,430
I'm gonna press M.

362
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,870
Okay, that worked.

363
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,770
Not only does this map allow us to oversee the site, But it
also shows that the Raptors are no longer nearby.

364
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,650
Good!

365
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,470
We have plenty of time.

366
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,450
Oh, yes.

367
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:45,810
Plenty.

368
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,130
Plenty of time.

369
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,790
Until, of course, uh, we don't.

370
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,310
Yeah.

371
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,770
All right.

372
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,350
All right.

373
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,650
Let's get this showcase underway.

374
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,910
I'm looking at what everything means.

375
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,250
Okay.

376
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,550
There's my Dippy.

377
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,650
My Diplodocus.

378
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,450
He's happy.

379
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,130
Oh.

380
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,770
Oh.

381
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,050
Oh, she.

382
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,110
I'm so sorry.

383
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,350
Dippy.

384
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,740
I will tell you guys, I'm so bad at...

385
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,960
As I am bad with names of anything, I am bad with names of
dinosaurs, so I'll do my best.

386
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,260
I see dinosaur.

387
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,220
I know dinosaur.

388
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,300
Usually.

389
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:34,840
Sometimes.

390
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah, I say usually.

391
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,400
Not really.

392
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
But, you know what I mean.

393
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,740
But...

394
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,560
Okay.

395
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,980
To kick things off, some rescues will be arriving here any
time now.

396
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,540
Of who?

397
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's use a delivery zone to transport them all in one trip.

398
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:50,820
Okay.

399
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,020
It saves time, and...

400
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,520
Big Lizard.

401
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,140
Even better, a boatload of chopper fuel.

402
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,160
Oh, there's a chopper.

403
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,440
Capture team standing by.

404
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,820
How do I...

405
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,380
Can I change, like, the...

406
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,820
I feel like I'm very top-down.

407
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Prepare for delivery.

408
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Oh, this thing.

409
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,780
Enclosures.

410
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,460
Oh, delivery's out.

411
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,880
Oh!

412
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,960
Place in the highlighted area.

413
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,280
Don't I want an area for...

414
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,440
Is there highlighted?

415
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,440
Is this the...

416
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,360
Is this the area that we shall put...

417
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,200
Oh, right here, right here!

418
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,700
Ah!

419
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

420
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,860
That is a highlighted area.

421
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,400
Okay, perfect!

422
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,320
When the chopper gets here, direct them to that delivery
zone.

423
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,080
Loki serotops imminent.

424
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,100
Get in here.

425
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,320
Oh,

426
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,590
transport Dinah's- six of them?

427
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,810
Place the delivery zone.

428
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,590
Excellent.

429
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,110
The Loki serotypes are on their way.

430
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,090
And the pilot said there's something special about the
group.

431
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,790
So, uh, consider my interest, Pete.

432
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,510
Oh, look, look.

433
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,010
Our other important guest has arrived.

434
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,610
Dr. Dua, welcome to Montana.

435
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,970
And thank you for inviting me.

436
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,790
There's all these people.

437
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,130
Your goal to help dinosaurs thrive has certainly caught the
conservation sector's attention.

438
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,790
I truly hope you can succeed.

439
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,730
Ha, so do I.

440
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,350
Uh, so do I.

441
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
Release them.

442
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,980
Release them.

443
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:41,600
Oh!

444
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,080
Oh my god, we get...

445
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,840
A wild juvenile dinosaur.

446
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,820
Little baby.

447
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,920
Absolutely remarkable.

448
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,860
And not, not a common sight those days.

449
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,760
You know, the mind boggles thinking about how its
experiences now will shape it.

450
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,440
Will its future be peaceful?

451
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,580
Oh my god, Jeff Goldblum is in the corner!

452
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,540
Deciding factor, I suspect, is you.

453
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,380
Four environmental issues.

454
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,060
Can we perhaps observe it more closely?

455
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm I'm cool.

456
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:37,220
I'm in look it That is so cute It's so Jeff is in the chat
Dinosaur appeal is one of the things that'll draw new guests

457
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:44,520
to a site there is so much boy to juvenile sell entry
tickets Why did they call them juveniles called the babies?

458
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,640
It's just a baby.

459
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,620
That's a capybara

460
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,620
Wow, select the territory tab and the dinosaur...

461
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,560
What is going on?

462
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,300
What's happening now?

463
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,200
As dinosaurs explore their new enclosure, they'll form a
territory.

464
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,040
It's inside this territory that their environment must meet
their needs.

465
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,980
Some dinosaurs play well with others.

466
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,760
Some... less so.

467
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,620
Keep an eye on who's sharing an enclosure with who.

468
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,360
Okay.

469
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,140
There's already six guys in here, though.

470
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,060
That's a lot, no.

471
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Oh, the horn, the capybara.

472
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,560
Right, select the comfort tab.

473
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,460
There is so much stuff going on here.

474
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,500
Holy cow.

475
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,880
I must say, that enclosure is a far cry from the environment
these animals are most for.

476
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,040
They hate it.

477
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,620
All part of the demonstration, I assure you.

478
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,000
We have a suite of environmental tools to help make this
enclosure more appropriate, which is, of course, our next

479
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,600
priority.

480
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,100
Yes.

481
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
Yes, it is.

482
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,700
Okay, so they love...

483
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,220
Some plant fiber plants baby.

484
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:04,180
Oh, yeah You know My favorite thing or one of my favorite
things about the This is a zoo tycoon pretty yeah, I think

485
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:11,140
of a zoo tycoon is when you add is when you add things that
the animals like They'll be like oh, and then when you put

486
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,280
things they don't like they go

487
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,740
We need calamites Oh, oh, big trees, big trees.

488
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,080
Does, do we need to go outside of the range?

489
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,080
What is this?

490
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,080
No.

491
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,440
Psychad?

492
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,780
Oh, wow!

493
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,080
Whoa, whoa!

494
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,940
Oh, meh.

495
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,520
Let him in!

496
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,020
I don't even know if he's match.

497
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,770
Oh, my dinosaurs attack.

498
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,020
Oh.

499
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,080
Need that fiber for dino drop-ins.

500
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,700
Oh yeah, baby.

501
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,600
Non-native forest.

502
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,180
What is this?

503
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,520
Oh, woodland.

504
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,980
Oh, woodland!

505
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,260
It looks so nice!

506
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,420
Wonderful work.

507
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Actions like this will certainly earn you a good reputation
with the conservation sector.

508
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,820
Hey, thanks.

509
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,360
It kind of looks all over the place.

510
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,100
Kind of looks like a mess.

511
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,220
Oh, okay.

512
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,540
We're done.

513
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,980
You get five habitats in one.

514
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,680
Uh-oh.

515
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,720
Not to alarm you all, but is that a sandstorm?

516
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,200
Oh, no!

517
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,420
And it came out of nowhere.

518
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,720
Typical.

519
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,660
They don't care.

520
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,920
It ripped apart some of our fences, too.

521
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,120
Storms like this can harm or panic dinosaurs.

522
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
This is a delicate situation.

523
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh, wait a second.

524
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,540
Our fences are so weak that a...

525
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,820
sandstorm right direct control the giant is a big threat to
our guests the priority needs to be tranquilizing it with

526
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:16,220
the capture team chopper we can repair the enclosure later
okay here i go wait i get to drive the plane i get to fly

527
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:24,000
and i i get to fly the helicopter wait here i go oh oh my

Uh, aim!

530
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,090
I'm aiming.

531
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,110
Uh, I am trying to aim.

532
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:42,930
Shoot!

533
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,770
Aim mode.

534
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,850
Oh, oh, there we go!

535
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,610
Oh, no!

536
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,470
Please!

537
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,850
Uh, I think there was a drop.

538
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,090
Shot missed.

539
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,850
There was a bit of a drop off.

540
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,690
Oh, go to sleep.

541
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,270
They're just chilling.

542
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,230
I don't need them.

543
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,550
Why are the, why is it okay for the Velociraptors to run
around, but not these guys?

544
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,070
Hello?

545
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,050
Okay.

546
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,730
These people don't care.

547
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,770
There's people still walking around.

548
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,110
They don't care at all.

549
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,540
They don't care.

550
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,780
Look.

551
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,480
Everyone's chill.

552
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,880
Sandstorm gone.

553
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,180
Everything's fine.

554
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Good job, team.

555
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,660
Because they're too big.

556
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,440
Oh, um, oh, look at, look at the guy, he's sitting outside
the helicopter, that's so cute.

557
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Let's go back home.

558
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,120
Exit, exit the capture team helicopter.

559
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,100
I can take a photo?

560
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,960
Oh, wait, this is so fun!

561
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,720
Where'd they go?

562
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,040
Where are they?

563
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,660
Oh, sleepy guys right there.

564
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,320
They do be napping.

565
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,700
Look at that tail.

566
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
Say cheese.

567
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,890
Get money?

568
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,810
Oh, yeah.

569
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,170
Yeah.

570
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,350
What's Q in here?

571
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,890
Exit to go back to default.

572
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,470
You can't have a functioning park without the right
infrastructure.

573
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,310
And without a functioning park, where would we be?

574
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,310
What, sitting at home?

575
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:49,350
home uh not teetering on the edge of chaos boy wouldn't that
be wouldn't that be dull hey nice shooting those dinosaurs

576
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:57,070
won't be waking up anytime soon so you've earned us some
breathing space now i'm not exactly a death with a hammer so

577
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,490
let's bring in the experts we need a maintenance facility
and like yesterday

578
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,050
Look at those, look at the size of the feet!

579
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,850
This guy kind of landed a little haphazardly.

580
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,030
I'm so sorry.

581
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,710
He's snoring even.

582
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,130
I'm in here.

583
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,490
Hey, just a sleepy, sleepy guy.

584
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,950
Maintenance facility.

585
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,670
How much money do I even have?

586
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,490
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

587
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,830
A place in the highlighted area.

588
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,850
Not allowed.

589
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,310
Every facility place will need to be connected.

590
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:50,430
to our path network oh like that's why it was connected here
connect to the path oh never mind i make the path let's go

591
00:41:50,430 --> 00:42:03,410
let's do a rock biome standard path very cool where's my
money at oh it's down okay i'm blocking okay hold on i'm

592
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,310
gonna move myself a little bit i'm gonna move like right
here i think then you guys will be able to see every

593
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,950
Or...

594
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,330
Up here...

595
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,510
Yeah, I'm gonna do this.

596
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:24,840
Here.

597
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,120
Wait.

598
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,340
Here.

599
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,340
There we go.

600
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,980
I think that works better, actually.

601
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm right here, I'm right below you guys.

602
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,760
Floating head.

603
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,940
Yeah, okay, we gotta do our path.

604
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,760
Where do I connect it to?

605
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,760
Oh, oh!

606
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,160
Undo?

607
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,630
Now get out there and repair everything you can.

608
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:02,930
It looks kind of funky.

609
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:03,990
Looks kind of silly.

610
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,470
But it shouldn't be a path that looks like they can go on,
you know what I mean?

611
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,970
Take direct... Oh, we get to do it again!

612
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,990
We're taking direct control.

613
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:31,200
where am i where am i going oh my god what this is crazy you
know dr dua dr malcolm your uh testimonials would really

614
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:39,620

sector if anyone will take us seriously and if they don't

615
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,060
dim is going down and taking what's left of my money

616
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,540
Whoa!

617
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,600
Sick air!

618
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,440
She brought me and the others to Jurassic Park.

619
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm repairing.

620
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,220
You know, I could dig out the report that I made for him,
but I'd need to update some details.

621
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,740
Dino GTA.

622
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,600
Us and Oz and running and screaming, you know, that sort of
thing.

623
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:03,960
Whoa!

624
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,380
Oh, sick!

625
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,820
Let's focus on the task at hand for the moment.

626
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,740

627
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,480

Excuse me, official Dino didn't business over here.

One more hole!

632
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,410
Oh yeah.

633
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,310

Everybody dives like crazy.

I'm here on official business.

643
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,330
It's like stuttering a little bit.

644
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,630
I don't know if you guys see it.

645
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,410
Oh, babies, babies.

646
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:55,890
Yes.

647
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,450
Oh my gosh, this is so...

648
00:45:59,450 --> 00:45:59,950
Oh!

649
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,870
Look at them hop!

650
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,650
Oh, they're hopping for some reason.

651
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,390
What are they doing?

652
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,710
That's it.

653
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,140
Crazy money!

654
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,200
With like the sunshine and everything.

655
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,720
We're just being little babies.

656
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,630
I'll take it from here.

657
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,630
Tell me some birthday!

658
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,330
It's my birthday today!

659
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,070
I just wanted to say I'm really looking forward to yours and
everyone else's performances this Friday.

660
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,850
And that way Amos are super duper proud of everything you've
been able to achieve!

661
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,310
Thank you!

662
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,650
Happy birthday!

663
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,330
Happy, happy birthday!

664
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,390
Thank you!

665
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,890
Thank you so much!

666
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,570
Ensure that Dippy are safely enclosed.

667
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,730
How do I get them inside?

668
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,410
Use the transport tool.

669
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,710
Oh, can I just, like, pick them up?

670
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,410
How do I... What's the transport tool?

671
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,530
I think I missed that part of the... Oh, here we go.

672
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,410
Here we go, transport.

673
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,530
When transporting a dinosaur, first choose the animal you
want to move and then pick where to send it.

674
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,310
Oh, that's fun!

675
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,570
Okay, we got a little flare going.

676
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:27,370
And you?

677
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,110
That storm could have torn the park apart or hurt the
dinosaurs.

678
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,770
We got lucky.

679
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,910
I think the hurting the dinosaurs is the more important
thing.

680
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,230
I suggested we prepare for such a thing weeks ago.

681
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:50,150
and we did prepare didn't we mr finch well you know the
to-do list was pretty long and how is i don't know we'd be

682
00:47:50,150 --> 00:48:00,550
hit by him put him up on a sign we can make him the new
mcdonald's bit of a long shot but uh dr malcolm any chance

683
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:09,570
you can ignore the whole breakout thing oh boy now you're
asking an awful lot of me okay maybe not ignore but focus on

684
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,250
how well we dealt with Well, can't blame a guy for trying,
huh?

685
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,650
It's too...

686
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,110
The dinosaur ragdoll physics is something I never thought I
needed.

687
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,690
Oh my god!

688
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,530
You're extracting him.

689
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,770
Mito's gonna be more of a menace.

690
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,290
Why?

691
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,630
Why do you mean by that?

692
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,790
Oh, they're awake again.

693
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,670
Good morning!

694
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,990
Good morning!

695
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,590
Are you sleepy?

696
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,550
Oh no, you're okay, you're okay.

697
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,970
Oh, whoa!

698
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,870
Oh, he's so cute.

699
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,590
Yeah, that's what my cat does when I let her outside.

700
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,030
She like rubs the grass.

701
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,570
I got a face on this guy.

702
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,350
Now how do I, okay, I use the transport tool and they're all
safe, so what's next?

703
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,980
You're good.

704
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,580
You're happy.

705
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:24,890
Yes, you're happy and you're good and you're happy But it
says one out of two, did anybody else escape or am I crazy?

706
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:42,110
What's this Fossils no fossils not built Oh, yeah, uh, oh,
it worked.

707
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,470
Okay, it was just a glitch.

708
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,930
It was just a glitch.

709
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:49,650
They'll let your maintenance ATVs patrol and fix the place
up automatically.

710
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,650
Oh, maintenance posts.

711
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,670
Maintenance ATV teams can be assigned to maintenance posts.

712
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,810
They can automatically repair, reboot, resupply, and inspect
buildings.

713
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,290
Whoa.

714
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,490
That seems handy.

715
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,830
All right.

716
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:15,950
You want your maintenance posts to cover all buildings and
power generators that might need repairing, refueling or

717
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:23,330
resupplying so like those posts also have a wider range to
them and any fences that break in that range will

718
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:35,710
automatically get repaired so nice oh mochi okay yeah we're
taking him home so this would cover like a bunch here and

719
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:45,870
then we could do over here well almost oh my gosh wait can
we fit this we might need to do like Hmm.

720
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,700
They actually got Jeff Goldblum back to voice in this.

721
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,120
I know!

722
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,920
It's kind of insane, I feel.

723
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,220
I'm like, whoa!

724
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,440
Okay, what if we do...

725
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,160
Also, there's like a fence that's not coming.

726
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,680
Okay, that's part of the tutorial.

727
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,800
Part of the tutorial.

728
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,070
Let's do it here.

729
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:19,970
Let's do...

730
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,690
here and we'll do we'll do three of them we'll do three

731
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:41,400
oh it okay assign a maintenance team once you've placed your
maintenance posts you can directly assign a maintenance team

732
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:59,600
to each one oh no team add team oh no I I have about three
but i only i only have two guys uh-oh i need to hire more

733
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:14,740
people task received maybe i should have put it on here they
can do multiple they can oh okay cool

734
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,220
okay that makes two of one okay okay for more dinosaurs team
two is over here and then these ones are closer they were

735
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:29,920
struggling in the nearby desert but we can give them a
better life here maybe it's okay one moment Corithosaurus.

736
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,220
They cohabitate wonderfully with Loki Ceratops.

737
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,860
Please do place them in the same enclosure.

738
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,500
Replicating natural varied ecosystems should always be a
high priority.

739
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,340
All right then.

740
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,460
You're the boss.

741
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,560
Until you say you're supporting us at least, then I'm back
in charge.

742
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,560
I'm kidding.

743
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,420
I'm kidding.

744
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Mostly.

745
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,560
Give me two minutes.

746
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,280
Coritosaurus.

747
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,100
Where did he say that?

748
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,760
Who liked this guy?

749
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,620
Transport too.

750
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,980
Oh, a lucky serotops.

751
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,320
Deliver all dinosaurs.

752
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,140
This place is shaping up faster than I expected.

753
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,580
The benefit of hiring the right park manager, eh?

754
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,400
I'm a genius, I'm an actual.

755
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,100
Look at what you've done already.

756
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,920
This site is our very own window into prehistoric Montana.

757
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,660
Do you like it?

758
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,480
Diplodocus?

759
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,160
That's how you have Diplodocus.

760
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,100
Diplodocus.

761
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,340
Diplodocus.

762
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:49,800
Diplodocus.

763
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,840
I'm going to keep calling him Dippy.

764
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:55,520
Oh.

765
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,560
Whoa.

766
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,280
Love.

767
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:00,960
Why?

768
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,280
Why are they walking on top of each other?

769
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,200
Look at this guy laying down!

770
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Oh, no.

771
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,220
Oh, those toes.

772
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,520
Dippy is a better name.

773
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,760
Like a platypus.

774
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,740
Yeah, like a platypus.

775
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,840
Open the container!

776
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,980
Okay.

777
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,620
Oh, oh, that's a tree.

778
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,840
This is the tree and my cousin.

779
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,520
Delivery successful!

780
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,180
Now, we better make sure those dinosaurs are loving their
new home.

781
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,080
I mean, I'm sure they are, but I pride myself on being a
good host.

782
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,220
Or at least a passable one.

783
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,140
They could certainly be more comfortable here.

784
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,600
Balancing comfort between multiple species can be a
challenge, but one worth overcoming.

785
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,540
Wow.

786
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,400
What an interesting pattern.

787
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,960
It's like a camouflage.

788
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,000
Well, you know.

789
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,720
You know what I mean.

790
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,280
Like a wartime-y camouflage pattern.

791
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,480
Not, I know.

792
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,580
Wow, the animal camouflages itself?

793
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,580
That's like crazy.

794
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,580
What do you like?

795
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,680
You like this leafy cloud.

796
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,900
Oh, and some brush land.

797
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,740
Alright, now's our chance to fix this exhibit, guys.

798
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:45,810
How do I...

799
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,030
Okay.

800
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,730
Ground leaf.

801
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,750
Is that what that means?

802
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,390
They want that.

803
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:52,990
Oh, no.

804
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,640
They don't like this.

805
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,660
It's noisy in here.

806
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,980
These guys are loud.

807
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,440
There we go.

808
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:26,580
make sure that they're okay are you are they oh are you guys
okay now they're so happy is it just me or do those

809
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:35,780
dinosaurs not look as happy as the loki seratops like many
species they need males in their herd to truly thrive male

810
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,380
dinosaurs are rather rare though So there's little you can
do.

811
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,180
Perhaps Din isn't a good fit for the conservation sector.

812
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,580
Your work is inspiring, but the dinosaurs need something
extraordinary if they're to get a foothold in the wild.

813
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,720
Maybe I should have done this area.

814
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,540
You know, the dinosaurs are adapting fast enough to
reproduce on their own.

815
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,000
The course of natural history is trying to reassert itself.

816
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,680
And you simply cannot fight nature.

817
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,980
But we could work with it.

818
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:14,940
know of a research station developing not only male dinosaur
synthesis but sustainable breeding programs too if it will

819
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,300
earn your support I suggest that we all head there
immediately oh they're so cute they run away from the car

820
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:27,560
coming back here right they blend in so well though no if
that research succeeds we have to return really is a good

821
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:42,600
camel male dinosaurs to these herds all right these gals
need some males these gals need a They want They want They

822
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:57,500
want the booty Open the world map Okay Map Oh This is the
world map Just kidding Oh We're going somewhere else

823
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,030
We're going to Hawaii

824
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,100
Let's go Let's go Welcome to membership Thank you Thank you.

825
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,660
Thank you.

826
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,990
Hawaii.

827
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:21,410
Hawaii.

828
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,990
Oh, you can see it down.

829
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,270
See?

830
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,790
Isn't it so cute?

831
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,570
It's kind of messed up.

832
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,310
It's kind of messed up.

833
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,630
The most kawaii part of Hawaii.

834
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:35,490
Kawaii.

835
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:40,590
Whoa!

836
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:52,550
Well, you know, I've been to a tropical island harboring
so-called groundbreaking research before yeah we know and i

837
00:58:52,550 --> 00:59:04,790
felt this same mix of sheer wonder and utter dread back then
too i'm more um optimistic about what i'll find this time

838
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:14,730
around but still if i if i may a word of advice yeah build
more places to hide than you think you need Very meta.

839
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,650
The fact that...

840
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,830
That poor guy is traumatized.

841
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:19,890
Aloha, Hawaii!

842
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:20,930
Aloha!

843
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:23,470
This is not a vacation, Mr. Finch.

844
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,550
We are here to support pioneering research on dinosaur
breeding.

845
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:35,070
And to that end, I'm pleased to introduce you all to Dr.
Luis Baldera, a leading paleoecologist.

846
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,110
Dr. Baldera, the room is yours.

847
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,750
Hey, good to meet you all.

848
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:41,210
Hello!

849
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,390
Truth be told, I...

850
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,430
wasn't expecting help so soon.

851
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,450
Kira seemed pretty insistent that it has to be now, though,
so I'm definitely going to make the most of it.

852
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,010
It's his bald era.

853
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,410
It's his bald era.

854
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,010
We're all dying to see how this works out.

855
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,310
Well, hopefully not literally dying.

856
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,790
My guy is so traumatized.

857
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:06,170
Dr. Valdea has done quite well on his own, but many minds
make light research.

858
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:06,970
Oh, babies.

859
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,490
We'll need a control center so that we can hire scientists
for the project.

860
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,610
Guys, they're so cute!

861
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:24,170
They're so cute!

862
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:26,230
No!

863
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:37,960
I can't hold back my tears!

864
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,060
They're so cute!

865
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,420
Oh my god.

866
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,160
Doth my eye- wait.

867
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,380
Do- Do my eyes deceive?

868
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,860
Is this who I think it is?

869
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,480
Is this who I think it is?

870
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,240
He's got the beak?

871
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,440
Is this the Aguadadan?

872
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,880
Oh, it's a Mayasora.

873
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,600
Dang, they look so similar.

874
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,900
So close.

875
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,640
It looks like him, though, doesn't it?

876
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,480
Place a control center in the marked area.

877
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,720
Okie dokie.

878
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,280
Where's the marked area?

879
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,560
Marked area.

880
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,280
We should hook that building up to the path network, too.

881
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,320
Classic luxury.

882
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,900
Oh, la la.

883
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,980
Oh, yeah, that's good.

884
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,560
That's fancy.

885
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,540
Science by candlelight is great for atmosphere, but less
great for productivity.

886
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,980
Why don't we have a generator down and power that building?

887
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,660
Generator.

888
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:14,980
Oh, wow.

889
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,560
Okay.

890
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,240
Oh.

891
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,180
Okay.

892
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,580
Scientists have a variety of skills, but researching male
synthesis will require experience in genetics.

893
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,540
Please hire whoever you think can do the job.

894
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,760
Oh, there's a generator.

895
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,160
Just kidding.

896
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,620
Okay.

897
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,480
Hire a new scientist.

898
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,260
Alright.

899
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,600
Recruit.

900
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,320
We just have people.

901
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:43,140
Wait!

902
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,500
Oh my gosh, I wish I...

903
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,940
Why didn't they ask me?

904
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,320
Imagine my mug right there.

905
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,360
Like in there.

906
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,180
I'm like...

907
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,510
We just have straight up people.

908
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:17,990
four out of eight three out of eight generalist welfare
specialist oh increases all skills by wow they decreases

909
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:23,870
task time decreases task time by 20% okay so they have the
similar ones

910
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:33,250
did they say what kind I need to get Increase your
scientists.

911
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,950
Combine total genetic skills to two.

912
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,930
Recruit.

913
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,510
Oh, we need genetics.

914
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,910
Oh, Joyce has three.

915
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,890
You can't see, but she has three.

916
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,450
Uh-huh.

917
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,290
No one else.

918
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,210
Everyone, only Vincent has one.

919
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,230
So we would either have to get...

920
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,010
Can I like...

921
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,950
Oh, I can refresh.

922
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,010
Let's see who else we get.

923
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,950
It's expensive!

924
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,290
Never mind.

925
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,690
I think Joyce is our girl.

926
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,610
That's the genetic skill requirement sorted.

927
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,830
Scientists aren't free, so let's not hire more than we need
for now, huh?

928
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,430
The hell?

929
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,390
Don't laugh.

930
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,950
I'm going to hire everybody then.

931
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:23,730
People are expensive.

932
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:25,750
Apparently.

933
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,710
People are expensive.

934
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,340
Okay.

935
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,380
Okay, first off, we're gonna need a science center.

936
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,300
See, while Parthenogenesis is a thing, it's, oh, that's
reproduction without a myth.

937
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,460
Dinosaur breeding typically requires a pair.

938
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,860
Male dinosaurs are uncommon in the wild, but we can create
our own with a bit of clever research.

939
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:51,520
So cute.

940
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,180
That's where the science center comes in.

941
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,520
Science center.

942
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:55,920
Woohoo!

943
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,980
Oh, I can choose its appearance even.

944
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,820
Oh, let's do the Jurassic Park one, rather than Jurassic
World.

945
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,460
You can... Oh, that's so fun!

946
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,340
Oh!

947
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,360
Wow!

948
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,960
Then we gotta path it, right?

949
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,080
We'll do the same fancy path.

950
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,860
Oh, oh, I like this.

951
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:25,580
There's, like, something so fun about, like, the
customization of, like, newer...

952
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,560
Uh...

953
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,400
Newer sim games like this.

954
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,520
Tycoon games like this.

955
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,840
Okay, research the following.

956
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,680
Male dinosaur synthesis.

957
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,340
Oh no.

958
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,840
Wait, you can make Indominus Rex!

959
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,220
Indoraptor?

960
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,100
What the hell?

961
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:54,740
What?

962
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,180
Angelo-dokus?

963
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:05,800
What?

964
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,800
What the...

965
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,840
Scorpio Rex looks horrifying.

966
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,080
I know you guys can't see it very well, but...

967
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,040
Spina Seratops?

968
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,600
Kind of looks awesome, though.

969
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,180
Kittious.

970
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,860
Spine of Raptor!

971
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,060
Whoa, Stegoceratops!

972
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,820
It looks like a fairy.

973
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,800
She was a fairy.

974
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,920
Wait, what else can we research?

975
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,780
Attractions!

976
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,760
Aviary viewing gallery.

977
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,200
Dinosaur encounters!

978
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,720
Put me in, coach!

979
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,540
Guests.

980
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,360
Core guest building, small amenities.

981
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,800
Spino raptor.

982
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,830
Standard paths.

983
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:18,070
I'm just looking at everything before we do the gene stuff
Operation security camp surveillance camera dig sites

984
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:36,780
Whoa That's a boy

985
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,460
That's my guy.

986
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:08,390
That's my guy.

987
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:11,000
I have to fuck him right now.

988
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,610
Can I?

989
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:28,490
That thing is so dumb looking.

990
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:32,510
Wait, but we can get the Plesiosaurus!

991
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:33,950
Oh.

992
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:39,430
Spinosaurus.

993
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,270
Insufficient skill.

994
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,950
We need more.

995
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:49,250
More!

996
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,320
Oh,

997
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,220
there's the iguana.

998
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,060
Wait, yeah, the iguanodons are in here.

999
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,140
Oh,

1000
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:16,400
I guess it also, you know, oh my god, what the hell is that?

1001
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,700
It's so scary.

1002
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,940
I guess it's half Minto Day.

1003
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:32,060
I hope I, I hope, I one, one day I hope I can find someone
who looks at me the way Mingo looks at kids like what is.

1004
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,720
Oh, my guys are here!

1005
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,480
Oh, my guys are here!

1006
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,140
Oh, my guys are here!

1007
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,680
Oh, yeah, baby!

1008
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,040
Wait, this is a mayasora.

1009
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:57,840
Mango.

1010
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,740
Oh, gosh, he's the only one in there.

1011
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,020
He's the only one!

1012
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,680
He's the only reward that you need!

1013
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,240
Oh my gosh.

1014
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,020
My favorite part of this game is to go into first person
mode to see what my guests see.

1015
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,580
You should try it once you get a bit more comfortable.

1016
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:26,900
Yes!

1017
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,200
What the heck is this?

1018
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,000
This guy is so funky looking.

1019
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,600
Sorry, I know chat is kind of blocking.

1020
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,680
Here I'll move you guys over.

1021
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:55,100

01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:51,990
Yeah, he's a massive too, I bet, I bet he's so big.

1027
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:55,630
Literally one of the coolest animals to ever live.

1028
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,310
I agree.

1029
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:57,230
Oh my gosh.

1030
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,230
They're just, oh.

1031
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,550
And they're terrifying.

1032
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,250
They're so scary.

1033
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,290
This guy is weird looking.

1034
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:11,510
Whoa!

1035
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,970
Oh, Karnataurus isn't here!

1036
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,690
I'm the Tyranosaurus rex!

1037
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,490
You gotta work for your T-Rex.

1038
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,210
This guy looks like a dog.

1039
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,130
Iconic T-Rex.

1040
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:43,950
Trudon!

1041
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:47,790
Velociraptor's in here too.

1042
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,970
Weird looking dog.

1043
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,610
Guys, doesn't he look like a dog?

1044
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:58,210
Dimitrodon.

1045
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,670
What the dog doing?

1046
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:07,570
It's cool.

1047
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,350
Learn more, guys.

1048
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,690
Okay, sorry.

1049
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,270
Research.

1050
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,070
We're back.

1051
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,710
This is not what we...

1052
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,630
Enclosures!

1053
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:16,470
Ooh!

1054
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,430
Land hatchery!

1055
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,070
Medicine.

1056
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:22,470
Wait a second.

1057
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:22,950
What was this?

1058
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,630
Oh, the hybrids.

1059
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,050
Wait, did you guys see these ones?

1060
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,390
Is that Sheila's dog?

1061
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,910
I love that skit so much!

1062
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:41,250
Dementia dot is more closely related to us than dinosaurs!

1063
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:43,850
That's funky.

1064
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,770
I think we should all...

1065
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:47,210
What if...

1066
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,230
Okay, imagine you guys.

1067
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,710
If we all started walking on all fours again...

1068
01:13:52,910 --> 01:14:00,930
You think we could start evolving to make that like our
prime mode of transportation of walking?

1069
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,510
I thought the big fin looked like a potato chip.

1070
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,630
We all started walking on all fours again.

1071
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,230
Imagine how fast we would go.

1072
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,230
We just started evolving back to...

1073
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,910
Return to Monkey.

1074
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:18,650
Yay!

1075
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,130
Return to Monkey!

1076
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,440
You start and let us know how it goes.

1077
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,700
I'm already dead!

1078
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,300
I can't further evolution!

1079
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,260
You guys are alive!

1080
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,860
You can do it!

1081
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,380
Get us back to Monkey!

1082
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,900
We can be so fast!

1083
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,320
Can you imagine?

1084
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,340
We're all running around on all fours everywhere?

1085
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:02,260
If everybody starts doing it, the bodies would feel that it
is a necessary step in the evolution.

1086
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,000
We just all have to agree to it.

1087
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,640
We have to be a worldwide decision.

1088
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,240
It has to...

1089
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,680
It sounds logical.

1090
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,060
It is how it works.

1091
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,200
It's how it works.

1092
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,280
People at the con's going to be very confused by the
crawling eyeballs.

1093
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:34,500
Everybody has to commit to evolving on to use all fours.

1094
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,240
No for me, dog.

1095
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,740
No, please.

1096
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,100
We would go so fast.

1097
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,020
Don't you want to run next to the launches?

1098
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,660
Umamusame!

1099
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:47,800
Umamusame!

1100
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,460
Actually, it's kind of messed up that Uma Musume doesn't
have them running on all fours.

1101
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,720
I used to run on all fours in high school, Chuni days.

1102
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,660
Thanks for reminding me.

1103
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:12,580
I saw a video the other day of a girl whose boyfriend was
chasing after their dog by running on all fours.

1104
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,860
And he, like, ran up to her on all fours.

1105
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,380
And she was just kind of like, ooh.

1106
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,520
He was like, oh, you didn't...

1107
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,500
Oh, she was like, why did you do that?

1108
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,080
And he was like, oh, did I like that?

1109
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,260
Me ick!

1110
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,840
Everybody's booty's in the air.

1111
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,410
She only pretended to be disgusted.

1112
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,450
You think she was really into it?

1113
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:47,130
Maybe.

1114
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,150
I think that should be another Olympic sport.

1115
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,350
You have running on two legs and then you have running on
all.

1116
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,150
force.

1117
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:04,950
We have, we can do it, we can include it in the next one.

1118
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:17,750
I watched this one VTuber who said she used to jump around
on tables like Curious George and also said she would

1119
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,050
pretend to be a werewolf.

1120
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,250
Yeah, what a weird VTuber.

1121
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,670
Yeah, funny taste.

1122
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,850
I don't remember saying I pretended to be a werewolf.

1123
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:53,990
Or are you talking about with my grandma when we would howl
at the moon?

1124
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:02,830
I definitely dressed up as curious George once and jumped on
tables.

1125
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:04,870
Minto's alt.

1126
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,090
I think that counts, Minto.

1127
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,000
Ow!

1128
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:27,000
You know how it's so funny when you see, like, coyotes or,
like, like wolves and they're like howling but they don't do

1129
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,460
like the like you know a regular like you when you expect a
wolf they go like oh

1130
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:45,000
like they're just they're just yapping like what is bro
saying shut up okay let's research the let's research some

1131
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:54,040
men oh we got a positive influence nice we're starting the
task it's costing us $500,000 to invent men.

1132
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,740
Yeah, they just scream.

1133
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,460
They're just...

1134
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:04,040
Dr. Balgo, do you truly believe that this breeding program
will work?

1135
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,400
I'm pretty sure it will.

1136
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:10,940
Dinosaurs breeding in the wild is rare, but I've observed
common needs and behaviors.

1137
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,100
Can I see your POV?

1138
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:12,660
That's what we're building from.

1139
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,160
Oh, it happened!

1140
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,520
We've discovered men!

1141
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:16,820
Right.

1142
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,860
We need to gather some genetic material if we're going to
actually synthesize a male.

1143
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:27,460
But finding an appropriate dig site will take a head for
logistics that I definitely don't have.

1144
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,380
Let's hire some practical thinkers.

1145
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:36,760
I like that word that we hire or we just we men come from
the M-Preg animal.

1146
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,060
Skill tree unlocked.

1147
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,100
Okay so what am I doing here?

1148
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:41,400
Wait.

1149
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,780
Hire scientists with a combined total logistic skill of
four.

1150
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:46,720
Okay.

1151
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,040
Logistic skill of four.

1152
01:19:49,960 --> 01:20:02,120
Recruit the where's oh logistics oh Vincent my man he's so
happy to be here now let's research a dig site with plenty

1153
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:10,600
of myasora fossils myasora there's surely no better choice
to pioneer this research than a species whose name means

1154
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:18,860
good mother lizard well sure what better reason to bring a
breathing thinking being into a strange new world than a

1155
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:37,660
lovely apt name I love the good mother lizard wait so we
don't have mayasura then who is this we'll need an

1156
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:47,900
expedition center to head to the base of operations for the
day I need to know let's construct one immediately oh here's

1157
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,420
the expedition center to send dig teams to dig sites across
the world.

1158
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,720
They'll return with fossils which contain genetic
information.

1159
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,100
This is to create new dinosaurs.

1160
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,300
Dig teams need scientists to lead them on the dig sites.

1161
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,480
The digs themselves take time and money to complete.

1162
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,840
The Science Center lets you extract dinosaur genome from
collected fossils.

1163
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:10,540
Dig teams can also find valuable materials that can be sold
for cash money, baby.

1164
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,480
Mommisaurus.

1165
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,500
Alright, we're going on an expedition.

1166
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,480
With a Center.

1167
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,720
We could do Jurassic Park.

1168
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,140
We could do... Oh, the DIN?

1169
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,180
Oh, they have, like, a one.

1170
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,540
Sorry.

1171
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,700
That's so fun.

1172
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:33,960
They have one for Jurassic World version, Jurassic Park
version, and the game.

1173
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:34,980
Oh, that's fun.

1174
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,340
I like how you can see what the generator, like, connects
to.

1175
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,100
Whoa.

1176
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,200
Oh, I gotta pass it.

1177
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,100
I gotta pass it.

1178
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:50,510
Fancy path.

1179
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,360
Connected.

1180
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,380
Oh, man.

1181
01:21:59,480 --> 01:21:59,720
No!

1182
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,540
Let me redo it.

1183
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,560
See, we send teams out to dig sites where they collect
fossils.

1184
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:13,280
Then we crack those fossils open and scoop out the genome,
which lets us create dinosaurs.

1185
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,300
Three different types of paths.

1186
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,420
That wasn't the most scientific explanation, but it gets the
idea across, right?

1187
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,080
Oh, look.

1188
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,960
It's the Jurassic Park.

1189
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,700
Look at his arms.

1190
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,140
were found in Montana's Egg Mountain dig site.

1191
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,320
Sounds like a prime expedition spot to me.

1192
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:35,320
Oh hey, that's not far from the dusty patch of paradise we
just came from.

1193
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,340
Small world.

1194
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,800
Smaller still when the continents were smushed together.

1195
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,260
All right.

1196
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,520
I saw the original Jurassic Park in theaters.

1197
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:53,360
I was so scared I had to be taken out of the theater when
the T-Rex attacked the car.

1198
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:54,820
Oh!

1199
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:55,860
Hi, business!

1200
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:56,620
Hi!

1201
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,340
Oh my gosh.

1202
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,180
Did you guys know that, like, the original Jurassic Park
novel?

1203
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,020
I haven't read it, but...

1204
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,200
It's like... Oh, it's like horror.

1205
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,980
Like, it's, like, actually scary.

1206
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:19,650
I remember when Newman from Seinfeld got eaten.

1207
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,450
It's super violent.

1208
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:23,110
Spooky.

1209
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,670
Alright, so we're going to...

1210
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:41,470
we're sending you I feel like our expedition is underway
let's hope they bring back some great fossils I feel like

1211
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:50,110
these oh we're like dropping cash you see that's going down
keeping an eye on dinosaur welfare is a full-time job and I

1212
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:57,650
don't want your attention stretched thin that's when trouble
starts the Ranger teams can handle it, but they'll need to

1213
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:01,170
be assigned to Ranger posts to guide their patrols.

1214
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:04,510
Let's build some posts and get those Rangers to work.

1215
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:06,050
Okay.

1216
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:14,690
Like when I expect like a dinosaur dig site expedition, I
don't know why I expect it to be like millions of dollars,

1217
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:15,230
you know?

1218
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:15,910
I don't know.

1219
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,390
All right, Ranger posts.

1220
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,550
Why is that guy there?

1221
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:25,090
Make sure the Ranger posts cover any dinosaurs that you want
your Rangers to keep an eye on.

1222
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:26,370
on during their patrols.

1223
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,020
These guys need watching.

1224
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,060
These guys need...

1225
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:40,840
Um...

1226
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,040
Need, uh...

1227
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,680
Surveillance.

1228
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,140
This is a path.

1229
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,000
Yeah, this is a good place, actually, to put it.

1230
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,560
That might be a good...

1231
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,220
Oh, Ranger Team.

1232
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,680
Oh, yeah.

1233
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,540
Require status check.

1234
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,740
Reducing guest appointment.

1235
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,720
There's no guests here.

1236
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,840
What's wrong with you guys?

1237
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,580
What's happened to you?

1238
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,220
What's wrong with you?

1239
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,540
Are you okay?

1240
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,280
No ailment data.

1241
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,860
A being influenza!

1242
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,120
Oh no, I hope not.

1243
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,580
Some digs start out self-financed.

1244
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,260
Alright, what are you?

1245
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,660
I won't let me click on him still.

1246
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:38,960
Noisy.

1247
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,070
Just yelling because you feel like it.

1248
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:46,360
Oh,

1249
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,060
someone's going in.

1250
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,760
Oh, they're both going in.

1251
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:53,100
Big car.

1252
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:53,960
Vroom, vroom.

1253
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:54,880
Little car.

1254
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:55,300
Vroom.

1255
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,960
Where are you going?

1256
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,310
All right, Ranger team.

1257
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,010
Can I see with their eyes?

1258
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,390
Can I see the POV?

1259
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,320
How do I see it from their POV?

1260
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,900
It's their only guests, I wonder.

1261
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,400
Possess them.

1262
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,400
Two environmental issues.

1263
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,020
Wait, make sure all Gala Mimus.

1264
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,820
Oh, that's what these guys are!

1265
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:38,340
Oh!

1266
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,020
Wait.

1267
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:40,660
Oh, wait.

1268
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:40,920
No.

1269
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:41,740
I didn't even notice.

1270
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,500
who guys were here.

1271
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,340
I'm so sorry.

1272
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,560
I was like, wait a second.

1273
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,460
I don't even know these guys were here.

1274
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:50,840
My bad.

1275
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,520
We need more Rangers.

1276
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:58,540
Um.

1277
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,160
Where would be a good place though?

1278
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,340
You can't just put it in the middle of their exhibit, right?

1279
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,560
Like, that's crazy.

1280
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,020
Galamitos.

1281
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:10,320
Galamitos.

1282
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:23,940
yeah direct control you get the car pov but i went like
through their eyeballs you know what i mean oh you can okay

1283
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:36,820
let's do right here that should cut this should cover the
entirety looking good now just assign ranger teams to those

1284
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:44,840
posts and you're set yep are not the only animals that this
client cares about.

1285
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,160
So, while we have some time, please ensure that the other
dinosaurs here are comfortable.

1286
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:50,900
I am.

1287
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,620
I'm taking care of them.

1288
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,680
Wait for Ranger Team Patrols to perform status checks.

1289
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,640
85% comfort.

1290
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:02,900
85% comfort.

1291
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,300
What's your comfort like?

1292
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,580
60%!

1293
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,380
It's not good!

1294
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,100
It's not good!

1295
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,540
You need more ground nut.

1296
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,180
They love this.

1297
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,480
Alright.

1298
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:19,980
A little bit more even.

1299
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,520
Okay, wetland.

1300
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,820
We'll put the wetland over here.

1301
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:25,560
Oh, whoops.

1302
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:26,860
Grass.

1303
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,640
Oh, here we go.

1304
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,340
Here we go.

1305
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,980
Bog and bog, bog, bog.

1306
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,710
Oh, wow.

1307
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,350
Wait, let's do some marsh too.

1308
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:41,910
Ooh.

1309
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:45,670
Cypress.

1310
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:50,090
Oh, not good.

1311
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:53,910
Wait, they don't like it.

1312
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:54,770
More bog.

1313
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:56,570
More.

1314
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,320
Okay.

1315
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,010
That's good.

1316
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,190
They're happy.

1317
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,270
Uh, thriving even.

1318
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,110
Oh my gosh.

1319
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,030
Wait, uh, let me click on.

1320
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:21,990
on you.

1321
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,210
Comfort 100%.

1322
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:26,950
Not heal.

1323
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,670
Missing ground leaf.

1324
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:41,870
He's coming right for me!

1325
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:49,170
Might be the greatest POV ever!

1326
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,600
Yeah, just strutting around.

1327
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,320
downtown.

1328
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,300
Look at them claws.

1329
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,340
Oh, he's so cute.

1330
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,680
Wait, wait, please, please.

1331
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,480
Oh, oh my god.

1332
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,260
So cute.

1333
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,340
Oh, so cute.

1334
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,400
Oh, so cute.

1335
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,820
So cute.

1336
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,920
They're so... That looks like... Reminds me of my cat.

1337
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,720
Okay, ground leaf.

1338
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:26,380
Oh, wait.

1339
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:38,360
ground leaf ground leaf leafy climbers what about this

1340
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:53,830
matches what they have so oh near the more wetland no one's
gonna want to visit these sites if they can't see the

1341
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:59,130
dinosaurs look this isn't my area of expertise but the math
is simple enough.

1342
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:04,890
Impressive prehistoric animals plus well-placed viewing
galleries equals more guests.

1343
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:11,630
Take those guests and subtract their spending money, and
that equals a very happy Cabot Fitch, huh?

1344
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,790
How's that for showing you working out?

1345
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:20,710
The point is, always make sure an enclosure has good
dinosaur visibility if we're to make this a sustainable

1346
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,230
endeavor.

1347
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:27,670
A well-positioned viewing building is worth its weight in,
well, concrete and reinforced glass.

1348
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:35,090
Wow, I know, beautiful creature.

1349
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,290
What did that guy say?

1350
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:37,530
Oh, the viewing.

1351
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,930
Viewing gallery.

1352
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:48,190
Oh, Jurassic World, Jurassic Park, Texacana, Europa, Asia.

1353
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,110
Let's do Jurassic Park.

1354
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:54,430
We have everything else themed, oh my gosh, look how cute it
is.

1355
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:58,250
Look, it says Jurassic Park on it!

1356
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:03,650
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1357
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:14,890
You guys know that the Jurassic Park River ride, like the
iconic Jurassic Park ride, the one at Universal Orlando, is

1358
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,250
closed at the moment.

1359
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:17,890
They closed it recently.

1360
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,550
It's going to be closed like the whole year.

1361
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:31,550
But some people were worried that, or rather speculating,
some worry, that it would be copying how the Jurassic Park

1362
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:41,850
ride is in Universal Hollywood, which got turned into a
Jurassic World ride.

1363
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:45,590
But no, they're just updating it and keeping it.

1364
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,790
Jurassic Park.

1365
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:52,550
So it's, I wonder what will be getting an upgrade.

1366
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:54,330
Okay.

1367
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:57,990
So, it's very exciting.

1368
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,890
It's not going to be Jurassic World.

1369
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,610
It will be Jurassic Park still.

1370
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:07,850
Yeah, so if you want to ride the Jurassic Park River ride,
you can't right now.

1371
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:11,810
But, you know, hopefully when it comes back, it looks really
good, you know.

1372
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,360
As a Hollywood native, the change was sad.

1373
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,280
I don't like it very much either.

1374
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,940
I don't know a ton about it.

1375
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,600
But I know that, like, one thing that I...

1376
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:41,820
am a huge fan of is like atmosphere and like you know i'm so
sick of screens and i know a lot of people shared that kind

1377
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:48,840
of sentiment too and they added like screens and stuff to
the ride and it's like i guess kind of cool because you see

1378
01:33:48,840 --> 01:34:01,100
like the mosasaurus and stuff swimming around but i'm like
boo no no screen so lame give me animatronics i don't care

1379
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:06,620
how I would rather see something physical than watch TV.

1380
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:12,620
If you're looking for first person mode, check left side
menu.

1381
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,940
It's the second button from the bottom.

1382
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,100
Oh, I see it!

1383
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,080
Thank you!

1384
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,160
I see it!

1385
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,280
You know, dinosaurs are related to birds.

1386
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,620
I wonder what kind of dinosaur Doki Bird or Kiara would have
been.

1387
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,920
Probably Trudon or Spinosaurus.

1388
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:30,280
Well, I don't know.

1389
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:35,920
Is Phoenix technically We don't Is a Phoenix a descendant?

1390
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:36,540
Okay, let's see.

1391
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,520
Construct at least two.

1392
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,340
Oh, we gotta Get a second one.

1393
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:40,780
Oh, right here.

1394
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,680
Here too.

1395
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,900
Uh It's not enclosure.

1396
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:48,600
What is it under?

1397
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,000
Oh my god, noisy.

1398
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,180
That's food.

1399
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:57,960
Uh, what was it under?

1400
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:00,980
Oh, here we go.

1401
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,450
Doki is a tomato.

1402
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,950
So true!

1403
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,350
Where is the path?

1404
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:16,850
Oh,

1405
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,690
I can only go so far.

1406
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,920
It's kind of ASMR.

1407
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:30,820
Nice.

1408
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,360
Ladies and gentlemen, we have added a new viewing gallery.

1409
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,580
Ready for you.

1410
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:45,220
team make it back all right did they uh find anything good
where did you guys come from use the science center to

1411
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:53,580
extract genetic information from the fossils they bring back
this is a task best done by scientists skilled in genetics

1412
01:35:53,580 --> 01:36:01,460
and anything not rich in genetic information could still
make us rich in petty cash so don't be shy about selling

1413
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:02,080
things either

1414
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:11,200
hello it's me hello Oh, it's me, the evil twin with the
goatee.

1415
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,680
What the heck?

1416
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,160
Why are they, like, doing that?

1417
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:20,840
Why are they...

1418
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,380
You, I'm, yeah, I'm you, but cooler.

1419
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,180
Are there people here, too?

1420
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,210
Oh my gosh, they're different even!

1421
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:39,250
Oh, wait.

1422
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:54,610
yeah they're different whoa where did you guys come from how
did you guys get into the park I don't remember opening it

1423
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:59,250
up okay first-person view select a start

1424
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:07,810
location whoa oh my gosh I can actually go in here

1425
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:11,570
Whoa!

1426
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:21,860
Oh, there's someone.

1427
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,660
There's like a person over there.

1428
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:30,260
During most of your tour, the appropriate information will
be automatically selected and displayed for you.

1429
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:35,400
Simply touch the area of the screen displaying the
appropriate icon.

1430
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:36,640
Whoa!

1431
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,060
This is so awesome.

1432
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,820
And you can hide the UI even too.

1433
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,680
That's so nice.

1434
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,640
Toggle highlight.

1435
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:46,620
Ow!

1436
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:47,840
Cool!

1437
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,060
I can't I can't see where the dinos are and I can zoom

1438
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:16,430
This is so cool This is so cool This is one of the largest
ornitha mime and dinosaurs This is really cool Oh look

1439
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:29,470
there's people here Who are you Who are you guys Where do
you guys come from And then then then they're gone.

1440
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,550
They're ghosts.

1441
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:32,090
Just like me.

1442
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,750
It looks so cool.

1443
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,790
It looks so good.

1444
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:49,330
I like how my park is half a star.

1445
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:55,910
Oh, are you enjoying the park today?

1446
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:57,250
Thank you.

1447
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:01,650
Oh, yeah.

1448
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:02,470
Yes!

1449
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:03,330
Yes!

1450
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,770
Oh!

1451
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:09,070
Where does he poop from?

1452
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,960
Oh my god, the real experience!

1453
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,520
Oh, look, you can shift to high speed.

1454
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:23,900
Wait, what did I do?

1455
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:29,260
Oh, you can pause if you want to get like a photo!

1456
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:33,980
Cool!

1457
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,320
That's so cool.

1458
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,160
Light off.

1459
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:36,680
Oh!

1460
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,280
Life, death, life, death, life, death, life, death.

1461
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:44,760
Wait.

1462
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,880
This is awesome.

1463
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,780
I see no pooper!

1464
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,260
How do you do it?

1465
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,380
Look how cinematic this is.

1466
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,320
Control low view.

1467
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,460
Oh my god.

1468
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,140
I'm sneaking around in the...

1469
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:09,340
in the facility.

1470
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:11,720
Ooh!

1471
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,800
High speed.

1472
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:16,540
Oh, it's just me running.

1473
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:28,390
this is so awesome okay we're back to uh we're researching

1474
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:53,870
so i can sell this oh and then research oh not hybrids uh
wait she this wait how do i do it Increase genome of

1475
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:54,590
myasura.

1476
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,930
Begin extracting genome data from the fossil.

1477
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,250
Do I click on the fossil?

1478
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,950
Is that what it was?

1479
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:00,690
This one?

1480
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,690
Oh, I guess so.

1481
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,270
Oh, begin task.

1482
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,310
Okay.

1483
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:18,450
While we're laying the foundation of the project, let's
build a hatchery.

1484
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:19,150
Genome soldiers.

1485
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:22,270
Can't breed dinosaurs without hatching a few eggs, right?

1486
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:23,250
A hatchery.

1487
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:25,290
So true.

1488
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:27,330
So we gotta make a hatchery.

1489
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:34,550
Uh.

1490
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:40,630
It says place in the highlighted area, but...

1491
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,570
Oh, I can rotate it.

1492
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,270
Okay, here we go.

1493
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,190
I was gonna say.

1494
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:47,790
This seems like kind of silly.

1495
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:49,210
No?

1496
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,930
Incorrectly aligned.

1497
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,390
It has to be this way!

1498
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,290
Okay.

1499
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:58,050
What?

1500
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,630
Has to be in the fence.

1501
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:05,590
Oh, oh, it's one of these types of buildings.

1502
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:06,470
Oh, okay, okay.

1503
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:10,720
Wow.

1504
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,600
Oh, okay, okay.

1505
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,160
So that they can, like, go in and do their thing.

1506
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,240
Okay, okay.

1507
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:19,820
Okay, okay.

1508
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,560
Oh, so I guess this really is the myasaurus.

1509
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:22,360
Maybe?

1510
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,400
Okay.

1511
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:26,840
Oh, fair.

1512
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,620
fancy path.

1513
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,140
Everything that is a official business gets a fancy path.

1514
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:35,000
Not long now until the genome is done extracting.

1515
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,540
What's that old saying?

1516
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,820
A watched pod of Dino DNA never boils.

1517
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,900
There's people!

1518
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,960
People coming into my park!

1519
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,000
Welcome!

1520
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,040
Welcome!

1521
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,460
Welcome to my park!

1522
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:54,800
Oh, you work here.

1523
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,620
Everybody works here.

1524
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,680
Where's the customers?

1525
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:11,400
Everybody's everybody works here we had two customers and
then the the ones that we hired to look like customers wait

1526
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:17,520
a second but that was definitely a family walking no

1527
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:38,450
everybody's going into this building oh no no these people
are definitely customers oops all actors oh

1528
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:51,760
guys it's not just me

1529
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:19,790
me unless they learned from the best what kind of park are
you running here we gotta make sure that people feel on

1530
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:26,310
their toes what if there's a what if there's a breach you
know they got to feel ready.

1531
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:28,990
How many people have you killed so far, Minty?

1532
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:31,610
Have you named any dinosaurs after Metal Gear characters?

1533
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,770
I don't think I can kill anyone in the tutorial.

1534
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:36,010
Dang.

1535
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:42,370
Thank you for streaming this, your dino-induced joy is
taking me back to my childhood dreams of becoming a

1536
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:43,330
paleontologist.

1537
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:45,470
PS Breaker Lake this Friday, so proud of you.

1538
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:47,550
I'll be cheering my Eiffel Heart out during the stream.

1539
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:48,530
Thank you, part-time!

1540
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:49,450
Thank you!

1541
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:53,010
Well, it's mostly just you.

1542
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:57,970
standards to Jurassic Park level too.

1543
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:58,530
Neat.

1544
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:04,530
So funny.

1545
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:05,910
Wait, we're at 69.

1546
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:06,850
Nice.

1547
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:10,170
Out of 70%.

1548
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:11,430
How do I get to 70?

1549
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:13,790
Unless we're just waiting.

1550
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:17,850
Oh, maybe.

1551
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,680
Okay, it has like a little countdown.

1552
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,300
So I'm guessing that will get us to 70%.

1553
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,940
So now we just kind of chill for two minutes.

1554
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:48,060
Mayasaurus.

1555
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:54,030
So cute.

1556
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:59,130
I rate five-star Minto Park.

1557
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:01,750
Thank you, because currently we have half a star.

1558
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:05,570
Oh, everyone hates us.

1559
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:10,110
It's funny because...

1560
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:19,270
the newest Jurassic World movie that's the only one I've
seen of like the Jurassic World series but the newest one is

1561
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:27,810
about how like people don't want to coexist with the
dinosaurs anymore it's so sad and they're like nobody goes

1562
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:35,490
to the Jurassic parks anymore because they're bored of
seeing the dinosaurs and I'm like I don't think that's a

1563
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:45,970
thing people go to zoos I love game did you also watch also
watch watch Jurassic World in theaters when you were a kid

1564
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:48,150
too no

1565
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:59,690
I didn't yeah people don't get bored of animals right
especially if they're dinosaurs I'm just kind of like it

1566
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:07,050
seems like a silly premise to be honest but bored of
dinosaurs I don't think it's possible

1567
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:19,510
Jurassic timeline, dinosaurs have only been reintroduced to
the modern population for 30 years.

1568
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,730
I don't think people would get bored in 30 years.

1569
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,570
People still like the Beatles.

1570
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:28,290
It's been a hundred years.

1571
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:37,690
So, I think, not the TikTok attention span.

1572
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:38,370
No!

1573
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,160
It really wasn't, oh wait, it wasn't really a good movie.

1574
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,660
I think that part of it was silly, but I enjoyed the rest of
the movie.

1575
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,780
I thought it was fine.

1576
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,040
I just, um...

1577
01:47:55,040 --> 01:48:02,420
Now that you can exert more control over embryonic hormones,
it's time to synthesize your first male myasura.

1578
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:03,580
I'm creating men.

1579
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,460
Just think.

1580
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:10,680
Generations of dinosaurs engineered to be female, and now
we're purposefully unshackling them.

1581
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:11,880
Incredible.

1582
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:14,720
Incredible.

1583
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,860
I'm literally God right now.

1584
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:22,340
Synthesize a batch of Mayasora in the Hatchery.

1585
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,500
Synthesize a dinosaur.

1586
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:38,580
We need Snips, snails, and puppy dog tails, and that's how
you create a male!

1587
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:39,260
Oh.

1588
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,480
Begin the task!

1589
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:56,640
oh my god i can only hope that all the consequences of this
are are being considered my guy is so traumatized of course

1590
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:06,280
but yeah i do love to hope we are considering every outcome
in this research your concern is understandable but

1591
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:14,120
unfounded unfounded geez what a thing to say My concern has
a rock-solid foundation of experience.

1592
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,020
You know, I've seen profits put before science.

1593
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:21,600
I've seen rapid progress, and the excitement around that
eclipse any caution.

1594
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,760
I want to see him come out.

1595
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,060
Not unfounded.

1596
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,100
Yes, I misspoke.

1597
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,640
Your experience is evident, but we are not biosin, doctor.

1598
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,340
We are not in-gen.

1599
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:38,320
Try to see this work with fresh eyes, optimistic eyes.

1600
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,180
Well, I'm very optimistic.

1601
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:49,600
so let's keep on going i think it's kind of i'm never gonna
be a fan of more outgoing costs but yeah he did almost die

1602
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,820
we're gonna need scientists with skills in welfare to
actually get incubation

1603
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:06,600
going there was a time where there were ghost hunting shows
everywhere now not so much i hope People aren't bored of

1604
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,300
ghosts.

1605
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:15,010
You guys aren't bored of ghosts, are you?

1606
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,410
I do worry if ghosts are out of fashion.

1607
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:20,830
Sometimes.

1608
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,230
I think maybe ghosts are...

1609
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:25,810
Maybe people don't care about a ghost anymore.

1610
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,540
Have you seen this before?

1611
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,300
That's a corny thing!

1612
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,460
Never out of fashion?

1613
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:40,520
You think so?

1614
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,280
Spooky around.

1615
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,300
I hope so.

1616
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,640
Fatal Frame Remake will save ghosts.

1617
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:54,360
Hire scientists with a combined total of welfare.

1618
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,760
Ooh, alright.

1619
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,160
Ooh, we got some new people.

1620
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,320
Welfare.

1621
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:02,980
What was it?

1622
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,760
Combined of...

1623
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,220
Five?

1624
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:05,980
Was that it?

1625
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,620
Yes, so we need to hire two people.

1626
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,560
Jamie, thank you!

1627
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:15,280
Ghost rights have come a long way.

1628
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,080
and hunting them isn't as accepted as it used to be.

1629
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,000
Oh, I was like, why am I getting hunted?

1630
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,700
I was thinking like with a gun.

1631
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:31,200
Like I'm like I'm a meat, a deer, deer meat.

1632
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:32,800
Ghosts are eternal!

1633
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:33,980
Yeah!

1634
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:34,720
Yeah!

1635
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,120
I mean, until I...

1636
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,860
Until I...

1637
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:47,040
Uh...

1638
01:51:49,340 --> 01:52:04,880
Um, you know, find my find find my peace and then i move on
i hope i reincarnate as as ketsuko atlas

1639
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:29,680
no peace ever all right i think mariam looks a little
freaked her eyes do not show like Juan here, she's got a

1640
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,940
gaze that's like, yeah.

1641
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,600
Dinosaurs don't scare me.

1642
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,040
Elizabeth, she looks nice.

1643
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:39,160
But Miriam looks really scared.

1644
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:41,060
I don't think she'll serve.

1645
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,260
Oh, wait, I have to hire.

1646
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,300
No, we could hire Hashim.

1647
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,840
And then...

1648
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,840
Okay, let's incubate those eggs.

1649
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:51,620
Let's...

1650
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,140
Gotta love the hatchery, right?

1651
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,620
Amazing building.

1652
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,260
But I did.

1653
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,580
Wait, but I need Welfare of Five.

1654
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:02,240
Hold on.

1655
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:02,860
Incubate.

1656
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,200
Wait.

1657
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:04,520
Did it work?

1658
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:07,360
Yes.

1659
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,040
Ready for incubation.

1660
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,220
Forge in it.

1661
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,700
Resilient, nocturnal, tolerant.

1662
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:18,600
Oh, look at the little heart.

1663
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,220
So cute.

1664
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,340
We can make our own.

1665
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,120
Oh, we're getting the best one, it seems.

1666
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:25,880
Skiddish.

1667
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,500
Oh, no.

1668
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,400
Oh.

1669
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,080
Wait, what am I doing?

1670
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,300
Oh, mail!

1671
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,240
Mail, mail, mail.

1672
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:36,980
Ew.

1673
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:42,260
Do I do all three of them?

1674
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:45,900
Or just the one?

1675
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,320
Did they say?

1676
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:51,120
Oh, I have to...

1677
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,240
Do two of them, I think.

1678
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:00,890
Incubate one male, one female.

1679
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:01,430
Okay, okay.

1680
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:02,810
So it is one male, one female.

1681
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:03,730
Okay, that's what I thought.

1682
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:09,030
We'll do the one without genetic traits because we don't
want them to be skittish.

1683
01:54:09,190 --> 01:54:10,070
That sucks.

1684
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:16,800
Welfare.

1685
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:21,510
Ah, there we go.

1686
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:23,290
Oh, we did only have to get the one guy.

1687
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:24,850
Yippee!

1688
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:27,210
Oh, hello there.

1689
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:27,910
History.

1690
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:29,670
Repeating yourself, I see.

1691
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:31,010
Hey, tell me.

1692
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:33,890
Did meddling in nature work out well the first time?

1693
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:47,330
time are you talking to me i'm just doing my job i didn't
play i didn't build this place oh my god all right ready

1694
01:54:47,330 --> 01:55:00,670
when you are okay release the new dinosaurs release oh are
they gonna be babies oh my god they're so curious look oh

1695
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:05,050
they're so cute Look at all that goo!

1696
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:09,610
It never gets any less magical, does it?

1697
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:13,110
Those are some beautiful animals.

1698
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:18,810
And note how the male and female Mayasura have different
patterning too.

1699
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:20,170
Yeah, cool.

1700
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:23,650
Dymorphism in prehistoric animals.

1701
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:27,910
And given how rare males are in the wild, I can't believe...

1702
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:30,330
I suspect we still have so much to discover.

1703
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:32,710
They got Jeff Goldblum for so much of this game.

1704
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:33,770
And this is just a start.

1705
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:36,610
So, let's get those Mayasura comfortable.

1706
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:40,850
Truly, I thought they only had him for the trailer.

1707
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:45,330
I didn't think that he was going to be like a character, you
know?

1708
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,810
Happy to see Minto playing snubbed strategy game of the
year.

1709
01:55:52,130 --> 01:55:53,510
It's not an impersonation.

1710
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:54,650
No, no, it's him.

1711
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,510
Also, Fokuro, happy birthday!

1712
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:02,410
I decree ghosts are still pretty cool.

1713
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:05,570
We can take you!

1714
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:07,050
Take it, thank you!

1715
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:11,190
Alright, let's build this environment.

1716
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:13,230
We need more ground fiber.

1717
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:16,030
Calamites!

1718
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:17,270
Ho!

1719
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,870
And...

1720
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:24,370
Fibrous lobe plants!

1721
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:25,530
Ho!

1722
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:29,110
That should be good.

1723
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:30,590
I should be pretty happy now.

1724
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:33,030
And we want them to be observed, do we not?

1725
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:38,870
Okay, now we need to check our Mayasara's breeding potential
and compatibility.

1726
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:46,890
Oh,

1727
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:55,280
you have ways of assessing their breeding capabilities,
their fertility.

1728
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:03,180
Oh, yes, there are chemical markers, but honestly, you can
tell everything you need to just by observing my man's

1729
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:04,220
living the dream.

1730
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:10,180
Isn't there a fallout shelter like this?

1731
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:23,760
charge here but do I actually have to answer that no no you
do not now eventually you do plan to have breeding in your

1732
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:33,520
breeding program right I'll work on it yeah yes yes we do
but dinosaurs need an appropriate nest first replicating the

1733
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:39,520
natural conditions these animals need is what sets this
research apart They're so loud.

1734
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:40,320
Holy cow.

1735
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,120
Replicating nature.

1736
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:44,160
No doubt this will go completely according to plan.

1737
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,200
Wait, everything is just average or poor.

1738
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:47,120
It does.

1739
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,940
Construct a medium nesting area.

1740
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,400
Restroom coverage attracts more of the...

1741
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,100
Wait, I'm sorry.

1742
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,020
The people want to watch them go to the bathroom?

1743
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,100
Or do they mean in the park?

1744
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:15,580
it should have been me not him it's not fair

1745
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:21,740
oh let's also put a ranger post in here

1746
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,080
because it seems like these guys need to be watched

1747
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:44,710
uh what was it oh enclosure this medium nesting area

1748
01:58:51,780 --> 01:59:01,380
we'll do it we'll do a natural looking one wait what's this
one look like what does it look like oh that's kind of funky

1749
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:11,220
oh wait I just realized I had one in here already oops wait
destroy sorry why did it okay never mind refund give me my

1750
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:22,820
money back what about the dino dino poop where did they do
it the world is their toilet Guys, if we start running on

1751
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,780
all fours again, we could be the same way.

1752
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,360
The world could be our toilet.

1753
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,680
Now don't get too excited in here.

1754
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,820
Some of you guys are probably like...

1755
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:32,380
You know what?

1756
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:33,720
I'm convinced, but...

1757
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:37,100
$50,000!

1758
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:40,100
Holy moly.

1759
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,280
Can I rotate this?

1760
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:42,880
Yeah, here we go.

1761
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:49,020
We went on some privacy to nest.

1762
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:50,940
Like back here.

1763
01:59:55,550 --> 01:59:58,570
The conditions are right and the dinosaurs are happy.

1764
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:00,630
Now all we can do is wait.

1765
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:03,730
Hey, hope I didn't miss the main attraction.

1766
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:05,450
Oh, uh, no.

1767
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:05,810
Hello.

1768
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:06,810
I'm going to first person.

1769
02:00:06,830 --> 02:00:07,390
Are you with the thing group?

1770
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:08,250
To watch.

1771
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:09,050
No.

1772
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,490
Where are my manners?

1773
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:11,910
I'm Isaac Clement.

1774
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:12,650
Hi, Isaac.

1775
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,070
Great to meet you.

1776
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:19,310
I do a lot of work with the entertainment sector, and they
are very interested in this project of yours.

1777
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:21,450
They guys are smart enough to use toilet.

1778
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:22,290
She could be.

1779
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,650
So I have to see this for myself.

1780
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:26,170
So, but it's all good.

1781
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:27,130
I'll be patient.

1782
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:27,630
I'll be patient.

1783
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:28,470
Hey, patience.

1784
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,950
That's a refreshing thing to see.

1785
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:39,130
You know, if only those folks that preceded you had waited
longer and planned more, maybe decided not to play with the

1786
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:44,210
genetic foundations of life, with all the grace of a kid
baking a cake for the first time.

1787
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:50,290
And by that, I mean you got to admire their ambition, but my
God, the mess.

1788
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:53,910
Who's going to go into the love nest?

1789
02:00:54,670 --> 02:01:00,390
Can you feel the love tonight?

1790
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:20,450
Here in the Lovedness There's just one guy in this whole
cage Everybody wants him Can you feel...

1791
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:21,090
Where's our guy?

1792
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:29,670
A love tonight He's so far away from the breathing mess.

1793
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:31,130
Oh, he's chomping on that.

1794
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:37,270
Oh, what?

1795
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:38,710
We got eggs.

1796
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:40,430
Did I miss something?

1797
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:43,910
You take care of the dinosaurs and they do what comes
naturally.

1798
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:47,090
I can't wait for what comes next.

1799
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:48,450
Wait, how did that happen?

1800
02:01:51,330 --> 02:01:54,450
This seems like a good chance to talk about contracts.

1801
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:55,470
How did that happen?

1802
02:01:56,230 --> 02:02:03,450
up on the side to build your reputation with the industry
sectors we've got eggs bring extra cash while you're at it

1803
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:21,410
here let's get you started with one now eggs found eggs
found whoa research positive temper temperament at the

1804
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:31,450
science center complete an expedition clear expedition I
want my guy to come home.

1805
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:37,070
So we're now waiting for the juvenile to emerge from the
nest.

1806
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:42,150
It should take about one minute.

1807
02:02:45,090 --> 02:02:49,410
It should take one minute for this guy to be born.

1808
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:52,130
Life will find a way.

1809
02:02:58,350 --> 02:03:00,490
Yeah, they grow up so fast.

1810
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:02,970
Oh, they are so loud.

1811
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:05,450
They're so freaking noisy.

1812
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:07,110
These guys.

1813
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:11,430
Wait, are you guys enjoying the park?

1814
02:03:14,030 --> 02:03:16,250
Our stars are going up.

1815
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:18,590
It's not just a half anymore.

1816
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:21,390
It's three-fourths star.

1817
02:03:23,370 --> 02:03:24,390
It's three.

1818
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:25,930
Oh my gosh.

1819
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:28,150
It's three-quarters of a star!

1820
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:30,810
We're almost to one-star park!

1821
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,230
Profit per minute.

1822
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:37,670
Wait, three issues reported.

1823
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,790
We have a guest count of 171.

1824
02:03:41,370 --> 02:03:42,910
I don't see the issue.

1825
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:45,910
Number of naturally bred animals.

1826
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:48,290
Uh, it's about to be one.

1827
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,790
It's about to be one whole guy.

1828
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:59,090
In 45 seconds.

1829
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:04,170
Ooh, let's go!

1830
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:05,390
Still kind of bad though.

1831
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:06,190
No, no.

1832
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,850
Can you drop?

1833
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,590
I can't even pick up the guests.

1834
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:09,410
I think.

1835
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,670
Hold on.

1836
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:12,790
I'm gonna select them.

1837
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,390
No!

1838
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:16,190
It's so lame.

1839
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,630
You know what I could do though.

1840
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:26,390
What if I just...

1841
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:28,030
Be free!

1842
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:33,180
Dinosaur threat!

1843
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,100
Danger to guests.

1844
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:36,580
It's an herbivore.

1845
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:37,320
He's fine.

1846
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:40,900
They are really big, though.

1847
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,260
He doesn't even care.

1848
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,060
Movement in the nest!

1849
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,460
Life is about to find a way out of...

1850
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:56,680
They really are holding on to that friend.

1851
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,180
They're like, life will find a way, and that's our
catchphrase forever.

1852
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:03,020
Okay.

1853
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:05,220
No one cares about the dinosaur.

1854
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:17,860
can i undo oh oh little baby juvenile dinosaurs created the
old-fashioned way how far they've come no longer man-made

1855
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:29,980
assets that test the limits of what science can or should do
but animals naturally bred animals wow fascinating so

1856
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:37,720
fascinating and possibly um cataclysmic i'm I'm wildly
curious to find out.

1857
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:46,640
Wow, Cabot Jr. You actually did it by recreating natural
conditions, no less.

1858
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:51,920
This could be just the thing to give dinosaurs a foothold in
challenging environments.

1859
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:52,600
He's running!

1860
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:54,720
Wait, I should fix the...

1861
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:55,260
I should fix...

1862
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:57,540
I feel like I'm staring at history in the making.

1863
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,220
And it is adorable.

1864
02:05:59,440 --> 02:05:59,580
Oh, wait.

1865
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:00,660
Is someone trying to leave?

1866
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:01,500
Oh, shoot.

1867
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:02,600
Uh-oh.

1868
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,740
They found out.

1869
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:13,360
full disclosure i've already named them cabot jr so make
sure you get their best side i renamed him let's be honest

1870
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:28,060
that's any side right that's the expedition team here's our
capture team oh the people are running standing by go go get

1871
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:31,940
him go go get him i think it's just the one guy yeah go get
him

1872
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:37,540
My stars?

1873
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:39,080
Look, I don't think...

1874
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,640
Look, it's going up, actually.

1875
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:45,400
Incredible.

1876
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:50,160
No, he's gonna fall into there!

1877
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,180
Okay, good.

1878
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,520
Oh, he's gonna drown?

1879
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:56,560
Uh-oh.

1880
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,980
Uh, I think we need to get him out of there.

1881
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:01,720
How do I do it?

1882
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,180
Can you, um, get him?

1883
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:10,820
How do I do it again?

1884
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,180
See, this is a good...

1885
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:13,900
This is me trying to figure out how to do this.

1886
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,320
Uh...

1887
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:19,180
I think he's gonna drown.

1888
02:07:26,270 --> 02:07:27,310
Oh, transport, maybe.

1889
02:07:27,710 --> 02:07:28,770
Ah, here we go, here we go.

1890
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,740
And put it back in there.

1891
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,540
I think that's our only guy who escaped.

1892
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,040
Yeah, he's probably back.

1893
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,800
Did that cost us money?

1894
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,140
Was it fun to see them be free?

1895
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:51,780
Yeah.

1896
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:52,820
Where's our baby?

1897
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:57,380
Where's our baby?

1898
02:07:58,900 --> 02:07:59,860
There he is!

1899
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:02,340
Oh, so cute!

1900
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:07,720
Minto Jr. Wait, I want to take a picture of you.

1901
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:15,690
What does this mean?

1902
02:08:15,890 --> 02:08:17,550
Oh, I guess it's just whatever I'm monitoring.

1903
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,190
No.

1904
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:19,870
No.

1905
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:25,690
Is he back?

1906
02:08:28,150 --> 02:08:28,390
Oh, there.

1907
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:30,190
Wait, I want to see him getting dangled.

1908
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,340
It's quite possibly the funniest visual ever.

1909
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:48,020
Yeah, it's real wet cat energy, for real.

1910
02:08:56,850 --> 02:08:58,470
It's so funny.

1911
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,630
It's so awesome.

1912
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:04,290
All right, select the Ranger team.

1913
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:05,730
Enter photo mode.

1914
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:06,950
Oh, here we go.

1915
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:12,490
I'm taking direct control and I'm entering aim mode.

1916
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:13,270
Oh, there he goes.

1917
02:09:13,950 --> 02:09:14,530
Oh, there he is.

1918
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:16,170
Wait,

1919
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,750
wait.

1920
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,260
I don't have anything.

1921
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:31,980
Is it because I'm in streamer mode?

1922
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:32,860
That's so sad.

1923
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:48,590
Wait, this is cool that you can like either let them do the
stuff themselves or like do it you know.

1924
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,980
What a photo.

1925
02:09:57,660 --> 02:10:00,340
Oh, I'm printing out a copy of that one for my wallet.

1926
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,240
They grow up so fast.

1927
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,800
What a photo indeed.

1928
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:13,990
So awesome.

1929
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:21,070
I wish I could save these for myself.

1930
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:23,550
Oh, wow, that's a really good one.

1931
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:26,390
Like, do you guys see?

1932
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,400
I'm seeing...

1933
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,060
There he is!

1934
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:47,140
I'm seeing...

1935
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:49,300
Head out of frame.

1936
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:54,220
The kind of like the difference between these guys and the
Aguanathon.

1937
02:10:55,440 --> 02:11:02,260
head shape is okay you can you can do your thing the guy is
just driving in the water okay we need to make sure that our

1938
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:08,640
guests have a good view of these little miracles too ah yes
the three most important days in any life the day you're

1939
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:19,160
born the day you die and the day the viewing gallery opens
yes the day the viewing gallery opens not allowed not is

1940
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:28,320
there like a place that they want me to it doesn't seem like
it okay why is it not allowed oh there we go um that would

1941
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:41,840
be a good place oh it shows you like the view you can see
wait that's so cool oh wow so like here is a good one it

1942
02:11:41,840 --> 02:12:00,760
covers a good range i'd say not allowed not allowed denied
this game is fancy ensure the juvenile is visible from a

1943
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:08,460
viewing gallery wait oh oh the juvenile is unwell that's the
trouble with having an undeveloped immune system I guess

1944
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:16,520
good Lord it's Cabot Jr. no it's a Mito Jr shut the hell up
you've got to do something Doc it doesn't seem serious to my

1945
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:24,500
eyes but it does need investigating we'll need a paleo
medical facility to do so you can choose an mbu team and

1946
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:31,880
ride alongside them or give them a task to diagnose whatever
is ailing that juvenile let's find out what's wrong as soon

1947
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:46,640
as possible okay yeah minto jr needs a better rest um all
right construct a paleo medical facility we'll do Jurassic

1948
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:51,800
Park version um where do they want want me to put it.

1949
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:54,840
Oh, can I just put it anywhere?

1950
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,480
It's kind of, this place is huge.

1951
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:00,740
Oh, wow.

1952
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:03,600
Yeah, they're just letting me build it anywhere I want it.

1953
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,260
Okay, cool.

1954
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:04,840
That's nice.

1955
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,380
Uh, hold on.

1956
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:10,220
Rotate.

1957
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:10,740
Oh, here we go.

1958
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:11,360
Oh, not you.

1959
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:12,240
Oh, well, that's fine.

1960
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:13,620
Um.

1961
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:15,960
Oh, there we go.

1962
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:17,120
Uh.

1963
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,240
It's a little crowded.

1964
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:27,840
but hmm maybe we'll do it over here

1965
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:44,890
and we need a generator do we have a generator close by no
I'm understanding how the game is working I'm starting to

1966
02:13:44,890 --> 02:14:01,090
understand okay so it's like lopsided and it's bothering me
but there's nothing we could do okay Okay, and a generator.

1967
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:05,570
Which, I think the most confusing thing for me is finding...

1968
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:05,710
Whoops.

1969
02:14:06,110 --> 02:14:07,070
Is finding where...

1970
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:07,770
Oh, here's power.

1971
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:09,470
Generator.

1972
02:14:12,770 --> 02:14:13,850
You know what I mean?

1973
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:16,050
Like, finding where things go.

1974
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:25,260
Like, where I need to...

1975
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:26,720
Where I can get things...

1976
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,560
Yeah, but...

1977
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,120
We're getting an ad task.

1978
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:32,360
Do it.

1979
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:33,220
Do it.

1980
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:33,540
Do it.

1981
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:34,880
Uh...

1982
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:35,980
Add the task.

1983
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:38,540
Do the thing.

1984
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,200
Add...

1985
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,440
Direct control.

1986
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:45,580
Wee woo!

1987
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,880
Wee woo!

1988
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:48,020

Sorry.

1990
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,760
Excuse me.

1991
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,820
Excuse me.

1992
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:54,980
It's a medical emergency.

1993
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:56,320
Uh oh.

1994
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:57,420
Wee woo!

1995
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:57,840
Wee woo!

1996
02:14:58,860 --> 02:14:59,160
Ouch!

1997
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,150
Wee woo!

1998
02:15:02,650 --> 02:15:03,070
Wee woo!

1999
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:03,810
Wee woo!

2000
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:04,870
Wee woo!

2001
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:10,890
Wait, can I get over there?

2002
02:15:11,230 --> 02:15:13,890
Uh, wait, where am I?

2003
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:15,210
Wait, woo!

2004
02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:16,710
Where am I?

2005
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,250
Uh-oh.

2006
02:15:20,110 --> 02:15:22,950
Um, can I... Oh, it's like really rocky.

2007
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:25,550
Uh, we might have to take the long way.

2008
02:15:25,950 --> 02:15:28,450
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we could go, we could take
a shortcut.

2009
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:33,110
Wait, woo!

2010
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:42,290
Uh, it just lags a little bit when I play this game.

2011
02:15:42,310 --> 02:15:44,310
like this, but...

2012
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:51,310
Is this it?

2013
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,690
Yes.

2014
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:55,670
Meow.

2015
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:00,370
My little guy.

2016
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:03,170
Medical scanner.

2017
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:03,970
Wait.

2018
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,590
Medical scan.

2019
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:07,470
Medical scan.

2020
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:08,830
Medical... do the thing.

2021
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:10,090
How do I scan?

2022
02:16:10,990 --> 02:16:12,030
Aim mode.

2023
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:12,850
Yes.

2024
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:13,410
Medical scan.

2025
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:18,410
Oh, I'm doing it myself.

2026
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:21,410
This is kind of cool that you could do it yourself.

2027
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:22,250
We've done the scan.

2028
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:26,450
So what's wrong with my prehistoric little array of
sunshine?

2029
02:16:27,670 --> 02:16:27,910
Cool.

2030
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:29,030
Alan's scan.

2031
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,010
She's just prepared to play GTA in the future.

2032
02:16:35,850 --> 02:16:36,610
Hi, Don.

2033
02:16:36,770 --> 02:16:37,430
Thank you.

2034
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:38,670
Hi Don.

2035
02:16:39,150 --> 02:16:40,110
Thank you for that, Gareth.

2036
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:42,670
Cure.

2037
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:44,910
The disease must be treated by an MVP.

2038
02:16:44,930 --> 02:17:09,120
team medicate I miss well then what am I supposed to do what
do you mean okay hold on let's get out of I keep pressing

2039
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:20,700
space select cap not cap Minto junior and start the research
Rabies?

2040
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:21,940
Oh, no.

2041
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:26,020
Uh...

2042
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:31,440
I thought it was rabies.

2043
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:35,500
As I suspected, not a pleasant illness, but not untreatable
either.

2044
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:41,640
Have your scientists research the cure, then use an MVU team
to deliver that cure by adult.

2045
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,160
I don't think...

2046
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:43,760
Sounds like a plan.

2047
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,360
You have the symptoms of rabies?

2048
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:47,080
That means it's already too late.

2049
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:52,680
I'll cut.

2050
02:17:54,880 --> 02:18:03,280
we got the we got the medication great that's the research
complete okay now let's get that dinosaur cured let's cure

2051
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:11,760
our dino you team to a nearby ranger post stat okay
patrolling mvu teams will automatically scan and diagnose

2052
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:22,040
minor issues major issues well those will call for a trip to
a medical facility right oh wait not you i didn't know you

2053
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:26,500
were there oh Ranger Coast at MVU.

2054
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,600
Wow.

2055
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:31,720
So they'll go around and kind of do the work for me.

2056
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,200
We love to see you.

2057
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:34,000
What are you doing?

2058
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:36,620
What?

2059
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:39,280
Where'd the last team go?

2060
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:41,280
I drove them in there.

2061
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:44,580
Oh, I mean, they'll just cure rabies.

2062
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:45,360
Easy peasy.

2063
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:46,320
Yeah.

2064
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,680
I got this.

2065
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:54,220
I can cure rabies.

2066
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,440
using only my pinky toe.

2067
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:00,680
Wasn't...

2068
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:01,260
Oh, this one.

2069
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,540
Ranger post.

2070
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:06,240
Okay.

2071
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:15,260
Wait for them to treat Minto Jr. with cryptosporidiosis
medication.

2072
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,480
Oh, no!

2073
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:17,900
Crypto!

2074
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,180
Our little guy is a crypto bro!

2075
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:23,960
You've done it!

2076
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:24,500
No!

2077
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:25,400
No!

2078
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:30,900
You know, I was worried there for a second, but Cabot Jr. is
completely cured.

2079
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,740
Needless to say, uh, thank you.

2080
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:36,540
Really, thank you for taking care of them.

2081
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:37,280
Meme coin.

2082
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:38,220
You're welcome.

2083
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:40,400
I mean, it was really expensive.

2084
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:40,840
Wait a second.

2085
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:42,420
You're kidding.

2086
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:43,260
Is that Bob?

2087
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:46,120
Oh, how I have missed that man.

2088
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,220
We worked together for years, Finch.

2089
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,040
My name is George.

2090
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:51,340
But Lambert's fine.

2091
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:53,780
Dr. Dua told me about Din.

2092
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,380
And about the juveniles.

2093
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:59,140
She suggested the security sector should advise.

2094
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:02,440
A perfect time for you to join us, Mr. Lambert.

2095
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:07,460
It seems that the situation at our Montana site has changed.

2096
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,180
The velociraptors are moving closer.

2097
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:16,040
Oh, the carnivores have noticed the human buffet that we've
graciously set up for them.

2098
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:16,880
What a surprise.

2099
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:21,380
Yes, well, we need to return there immediately and handle
the situation.

2100
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:26,040
Back to Montana.

2101
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:30,360
isn't that so exciting

2102
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:45,540
uh okay emergency event oh shoot I think they might be in
trouble

2103
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:59,150
dr. Malcolm is non-stop sass I don't think Jeff Goldblum
ever plays I don't think he acts You know what I mean?

2104
02:21:00,690 --> 02:21:02,350
I think that guy just plays himself.

2105
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:06,490
That guy...

2106
02:21:06,490 --> 02:21:07,170
And you know what?

2107
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:07,890
It's fine.

2108
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:10,550
That's what everybody wants and expects.

2109
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:11,870
Ah!

2110
02:21:16,030 --> 02:21:16,830
He's so cute.

2111
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:17,870
Go!

2112
02:21:18,210 --> 02:21:18,510
Go!

2113
02:21:18,770 --> 02:21:18,850
Go!

2114
02:21:20,650 --> 02:21:21,930
What are they doing?

2115
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:23,610
Um, the inevitable?

2116
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:26,450
They're all like, they're like the power puff girls.

2117
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:27,450
Wait, is this?

2118
02:21:28,350 --> 02:21:30,130
This is also...

2119
02:21:30,910 --> 02:21:31,410
Densetsu.

2120
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:35,990
You see, blue is Vicky, green is Mito, and pink is Phoebe!

2121
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:37,810
Densetsu!

2122
02:21:38,370 --> 02:21:39,050
I alert people.

2123
02:21:39,630 --> 02:21:42,130
Finch, it's time to prove that Din cares about security.

2124
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:46,170
Well, the guests and me need someone to hide.

2125
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:47,930
Build an emergency shelter.

2126
02:21:49,770 --> 02:21:51,050
Wait, where did the other guys go?

2127
02:21:52,290 --> 02:21:53,570
Oh, Vicky!

2128
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:55,010
Wait, can I name you?

2129
02:21:59,120 --> 02:21:59,680
Vick...

2130
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,260
Tori Aroman.

2131
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,400
My guy's hungry.

2132
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:06,940
Where's the rest of them?

2133
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:07,640
Oh, here you are.

2134
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:09,240
They can wait.

2135
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:09,780
Hold on.

2136
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:15,500
Minto Phantom.

2137
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:19,880
Where'd Phoebe go?

2138
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:29,240
Phoebe.

2139
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:35,600
Yay!

2140
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,260
What's going on now?

2141
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:37,780
What am I doing?

2142
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:48,340
construct at least one emergency shelter oh cool all right I
guess that's kind of important huh yeah cool we got

2143
02:22:48,340 --> 02:23:01,280
emergency shelter we'll put you all right everybody run run
to here run to right here a fine-looking hidey hole there

2144
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:10,920
hidey hole open up the shelter to put out the alert open up
Raptors can be a tricky target on the best of days.

2145
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,020
These guys are not even...

2146
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:13,960
I suggest letting the pros do their thing.

2147
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:19,720
Give the capture team the task to tranquilize those
dinosaurs and put a stop to the rampage.

2148
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:20,500
No.

2149
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:22,740
They're not even going in.

2150
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,440
They're just going to tank it.

2151
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:27,320
No sense of urgency.

2152
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,300
They're still going.

2153
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,200
These guys...

2154
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:37,920
Oh, never mind.

2155
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,040
Are they coming closer?

2156
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:43,520
What is it?

2157
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:44,520
Oh, is this a Velociraptor?

2158
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:47,320
Aww, he's so cute!

2159
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:50,700
Reducing guest approval.

2160
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:52,840
These guys don't care either.

2161
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:53,880
The guys we hired.

2162
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,360
Okay, order the capture team to tranquilize them.

2163
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:00,640
Oh, but they're just chilling.

2164
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,660
Why do we need to do anything?

2165
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,140
Oh, no, we could get hookworms.

2166
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:08,940
How do I do this again?

2167
02:24:18,110 --> 02:24:31,770
me oh they're on a move again weird looking dog uh let's see
oh closest response uh there we go uh capture team add task

2168
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:45,350
tranquilize cabot finch sounds like jerry from rick and
boardy what if it is it could be

2169
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:53,040
oh oh geez This guy's pretty close in the park.

2170
02:25:02,150 --> 02:25:03,850
Did we get the other one?

2171
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:08,920
If I get one guy...

2172
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:09,260
Okay, there...

2173
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:09,700
Oh, nice.

2174
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:10,800
So it is like a...

2175
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:12,140
You do this and then you go do that.

2176
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:13,180
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

2177
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:18,470
Weep, weep.

2178
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:19,630
Weep, weep, weep.

2179
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:22,330
What?

2180
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:24,110
Oh, he's like circling.

2181
02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:24,910
Do you see this?

2182
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:28,110
He's circling the area.

2183
02:25:28,610 --> 02:25:30,810
Oh, that's crazy.

2184
02:25:34,050 --> 02:25:35,970
He's like, I smell people here.

2185
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:37,670
I wonder if they killed anyone.

2186
02:25:37,970 --> 02:25:38,870
They ate any guys.

2187
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:44,520
Wait, I want to do it.

2188
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:45,320
Can I do it?

2189
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:50,900
Oh, they got it already.

2190
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:51,120
Right.

2191
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:57,060
Those dinosaurs won't be waking up anytime soon, but we
better have an enclosure ready for when they do.

2192
02:25:57,900 --> 02:26:02,120
We do have a half-built enclosure on site that will probably
do the job.

2193
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:04,160
If you can, you know, finish it up.

2194
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:05,080
Okay.

2195
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:16,860
just steal them and then we that's so funny those fences
with a generator if an animal tries to escape it could hurt

2196
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:25,180
itself or even your guests a light shock however will act as
a gentle deterrent yeah listen you can call me paranoid or

2197
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:35,380
more accurately justifiably nervous but i'm telling you
those generators tend to run out of juice at the uh very

2198
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:45,500
worst of times don't we all but no I don't want dinosaurs
getting out either worth making sure that the generators are

2199
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:51,780
in range of a maintenance post so our maintenance team can
keep an eye on them right oh when the enclosure is ready

2200
02:26:51,780 --> 02:26:59,060
give the order to transport those sleeping meat eaters into
it I'll leave it in your capable hands okay take as long as

2201
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:02,520
you need but not too long even sleeping

2202
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,220
Wait, ah, stop, stop, stop.

2203
02:27:07,220 --> 02:27:07,980
Wait, ah, stop.

2204
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:08,300
Undo.

2205
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:13,180
Undo.

2206
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:13,580
Wait, undo.

2207
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:15,240
No!

2208
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,780
It looks ugly!

2209
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:18,920
No!

2210
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:21,640
I messed up.

2211
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:24,040
It won't let me undo.

2212
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,460
I messed up.

2213
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:38,520
Okay.

2214
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:41,720
Nice.

2215
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,060
One at a time.

2216
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:44,440
Break it!

2217
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:45,100
Oh, you're right.

2218
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:50,760
Yep, I don't care anymore.

2219
02:27:54,200 --> 02:28:00,240
So if only a part of the fence is powered, does that mean
the whole thing is powered?

2220
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,600
Like I don't need a generator on everything, right?

2221
02:28:08,510 --> 02:28:10,910
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see these guys.

2222
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:20,640
Deliver PB!

2223
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:24,780
Deliver Victoria Roman!

2224
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:31,730
Can I do it?

2225
02:28:32,810 --> 02:28:33,890
Can I do it?

2226
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:36,030
Or here I go.

2227
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:40,290
Okay, here I go.

2228
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:52,600
Aim mode.

2229
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:15,900
Never

2230
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,320
mind.

2231
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:21,920
Never mind.

2232
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:25,780
Never mind.

2233
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:26,700
We do.

2234
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:30,900
Uh...

2235
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:39,880
Where's the...

2236
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:40,800
Where's our last guy?

2237
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:41,800
Oh, here.

2238
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:49,200
Oh, he's alive!

2239
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:50,420
Good work.

2240
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,820
Now wait for the delivery to end and confirm they're all
enclosed.

2241
02:29:55,380 --> 02:30:00,120
They're so funny when they're just ragdolled in there.

2242
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:09,260
the air Alan and Ellie had a dig site near here in this
scenic patch of Montana's Badlands you know they were

2243
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:19,820
digging for fossilized dinosaurs and now you're containing
living breathing thinking dinosaurs a mere stones throw away

2244
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:31,400
that's mean Wow it's really you know it's poetic in a vague
sort of sense and deeply terrifying in a more specific sort

2245
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:31,960
of sense.

2246
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:33,580
Oh, dang.

2247
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:40,160
I was hoping that I could see it in first person as they get
dropped into the

2248
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:45,020
bank.

2249
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:53,020
Alright, how do you guys like your enclosure, huh?

2250
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,320
Aww, so cute!

2251
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:57,700
Oh!

2252
02:30:58,380 --> 02:30:58,620
Hi.

2253
02:30:59,020 --> 02:30:59,120
Oh.

2254
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:02,420
Poetry.

2255
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:03,760
It rhymes.

2256
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:15,260
you need more uh cover oh holy hell

2257
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:33,060
whoa wow how does this stuff grow here you know like how you
maintain it and then also more prey you want a little goat

2258
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:42,420
make sure to close any shell once you've dealt with the
threat after all guests aren't likely to spend money while

2259
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:53,400
they're busy hunkering down although a bunker gift shop
isn't a bad idea this is closed right I messed it up yeah

2260
02:31:53,400 --> 02:32:04,300
it's it's closed I messed it up a little bit but it's fine
wait this is kind of messed up

2261
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:09,320
Are we gonna see nature happen?

2262
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:13,980
Oh, the girls are fighting?

2263
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:17,530
Minto going in for the kill?

2264
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:24,320
Whoa!

2265
02:32:38,990 --> 02:32:40,390
Chomping down!

2266
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:42,230
Ah, second goat.

2267
02:32:45,230 --> 02:32:45,830
I hear Nihongo.

2268
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:53,780
We can now... Oh, backup generator.

2269
02:32:53,800 --> 02:33:07,280
wait what did it say I don't know sorry I didn't read I went
too fast I hear fonts I can't believe I got invited to the

2270
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:21,500
den set to dot a roar live stage I hope nothing goes wrong a
closed shelter nice job dealing with those raptors thank you

2271
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:29,460
vicious and intelligent carnivores don't tend to mix well
with guests hi dippy vicious and intelligent they may be but

2272
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:36,240
those velociraptors deserve as much support as any other
dinosaur agree a feeder that gives them an outlet for their

2273
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:45,900
hunting instinct would be particularly beneficial better the
goats than us is what you mean to say oh i already did this

2274
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:57,340
i already did this oh my god herbivores do not require
feeders to satisfy carnivores and some pisivores?

2275
02:33:58,320 --> 02:33:59,300
Is that like a fish?

2276
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:11,660
This is what I do to the three goats that told me to finish
the ritual.

2277
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:13,780
Fish eaters.

2278
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:15,740
Okay, I use context clues.

2279
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:20,500
I'll do another one.

2280
02:34:20,980 --> 02:34:21,840
We can add more than one.

2281
02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:23,040
Place a live feeder.

2282
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:23,540
Oh, never mind.

2283
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:23,900
It's already.

2284
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,360
Make sure your dinosaurs have an average comfort of 95%.

2285
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:28,740
Build a ranger post that can reach the velociraptor.

2286
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:34,380
I feel bad for the poor sucker that has to go in here.

2287
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:36,560
Wait, this is a maintenance post.

2288
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:37,540
Is it the same thing?

2289
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,400
Add it to the list.

2290
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,240
Ranger post.

2291
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:55,360
Operations.

2292
02:34:59,180 --> 02:35:00,420
What's a Ranger post?

2293
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:02,960
Ranger team.

2294
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:05,080
Expedition.

2295
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:08,160
Am I stupid?

2296
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:11,950
Wait, where is it at?

2297
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:22,800
Well, there's this maintenance post.

2298
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:24,120
It's probably fine, though.

2299
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:25,850
When I conned down.

2300
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,540
Operations.

2301
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:43,640
I wish to adopt Mindo Jr.

2302
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:52,070
Um...

2303
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:05,410
I mean, we should have a viewing gallery.

2304
02:36:06,930 --> 02:36:07,930
I'll do it.

2305
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:18,130
Not allowed.

2306
02:36:28,460 --> 02:36:30,760
Wait, oh, she is rage baiting me.

2307
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:33,180
Ranger is next to the goat.

2308
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:34,380
Wait.

2309
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:36,160
Oh my god.

2310
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:39,020
I, I seriously, you guys, I see.

2311
02:36:40,820 --> 02:36:42,580
I actually didn't see it.

2312
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:44,240
I'm sorry.

2313
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:49,780
I wasn't even trying to be stupid.

2314
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:51,660
Those raptors will actually be boosting the sights of the
year.

2315
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:54,700
And more appeal means more guests.

2316
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:56,740
So it's good news in my book.

2317
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:01,680
Guests will actually need to be able to see the raptors to
be impressed by them.

2318
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:04,800
But that's why we build viewing galleries, right?

2319
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:06,080
Yeah, I already did it.

2320
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,620
Dinosaur appeal is great.

2321
02:37:08,980 --> 02:37:12,840
But dinosaur visibility is what will actually sell tickets.

2322
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:14,060
Rocky, thank you so much.

2323
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,740
Improving visibility with attractions.

2324
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:23,460
great thank you yeah important step if we actually want to
make a profit here and you do want to make a profit right

2325
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:33,840
really i'd rather like to revisit our chrythosaurus they
needed males in the herd to thrive and that's exactly what

2326
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:41,000
we can provide them with thank you for the very much thank
you to begin synthesis we will need an expedition center

2327
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,320
everyone we're playing dinosaurs

2328
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:48,540
We have processed the fossils in the Science Center.

2329
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:51,540
We can synthesize the mails in a hatchery.

2330
02:38:02,370 --> 02:38:02,950
Um...

2331
02:38:04,450 --> 02:38:07,410
I think that guy just went after our rangers!

2332
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:10,310
Take over Nyongyan!

2333
02:38:10,390 --> 02:38:11,010
Thank you!

2334
02:38:11,130 --> 02:38:12,370
No, I will thank you!

2335
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:15,210
All right, construct the operational hatchery.

2336
02:38:18,890 --> 02:38:19,470
Uh...

2337
02:38:19,470 --> 02:38:20,310
Okay, hold on.

2338
02:38:20,310 --> 02:38:22,290
Like I said, I said this before, did I not?

2339
02:38:22,390 --> 02:38:24,710
That I was like, there's so many things I have to, like,
remember.

2340
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:26,230
Hatchery.

2341
02:38:27,990 --> 02:38:30,590
Also, my camera, like, went crazy.

2342
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:31,610
Wait.

2343
02:38:33,310 --> 02:38:34,150
Flip around.

2344
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:35,830
Flip it around.

2345
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:38,350
Making me...

2346
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:40,090
Like, here?

2347
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:40,910
Oh, my gosh.

2348
02:38:41,810 --> 02:38:42,430
Oh, my gosh.

2349
02:38:42,650 --> 02:38:43,150
Oh, my gosh.

2350
02:38:46,970 --> 02:38:48,450
Oh, wait.

2351
02:38:49,290 --> 02:38:50,290
Sorry, not Velocity.

2352
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:50,750
Raptor.

2353
02:38:52,150 --> 02:38:53,950
That would have been awkward, huh?

2354
02:38:57,400 --> 02:38:58,580
Phil, thank you so much for the podcast.

2355
02:38:58,740 --> 02:38:58,960
Get in!

2356
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:00,460
Not the Raptors.

2357
02:39:00,860 --> 02:39:01,680
I caught myself.

2358
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:03,140
I caught myself.

2359
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:04,760
Oh my gosh.

2360
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:08,280
This building is like crazy stupid, though.

2361
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:11,140
Okay, there we go.

2362
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:12,200
Boyfect.

2363
02:39:16,510 --> 02:39:17,650
In the pathway.

2364
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:19,670
Do-do-do-do.

2365
02:39:22,830 --> 02:39:25,170
Construct an Operational Expedition Center.

2366
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:29,490
This one.

2367
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:31,230
This can go anywhere.

2368
02:39:32,490 --> 02:39:35,330
So we'll put it right here.

2369
02:39:36,010 --> 02:39:36,990
Wait, does this need a path?

2370
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:37,470
Yes.

2371
02:39:38,810 --> 02:39:42,190
Pathway connects to you.

2372
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:48,140
I wish I could curb it more, you know.

2373
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:51,540
Ends up being a little like that.

2374
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:54,160
But it is what it is.

2375
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:55,240
It's fine.

2376
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:02,760
The Tenzetsu Raptor art Increase the genome

2377
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:15,930
Research Is it Where is our guy?

2378
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:19,110
What's he under?

2379
02:40:33,110 --> 02:40:34,170
Under this one, no?

2380
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:46,680
Chung Kingosaurus I'm done Who the heck is Chung
King-a-saurus?

2381
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,140
I must look this guy up right now.

2382
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:53,420
Thank you for the content.

2383
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:55,040
Chung-king.

2384
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:56,660
I spat literally.

2385
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:04,830
Chung-king-a-saurus.

2386
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:18,080
I need to see what he looks like right now.

2387
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:24,580
He looks...

2388
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:40,460
like like if a if a stegosaurus and ankylosaurus were like
similar big chungus am I in the right place to do this

2389
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:57,160
increase the genome from our gods where I'm lost actually oh
here they are where's our you poor you're Corey, Corey, I

2390
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,780
can't say this guy's name.

2391
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:08,470
So this is the big chungus from which all others descend.

2392
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,350
Looking for food.

2393
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:16,240
Family tree.

2394
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:17,040
Fertility.

2395
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:19,220
Contraceptives!

2396
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,480
Oh my god!

2397
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:24,300
A breeding heat map!

2398
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:25,580
Oh!

2399
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:30,780
Tori in the house source.

2400
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:31,620
Yeah, so true.

2401
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:35,660
So we need to do genome.

2402
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:37,920
Synthesize.

2403
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,000
Can I do it in here?

2404
02:42:46,770 --> 02:42:47,210
No.

2405
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:49,450
Wait, VU genome library.

2406
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:52,350
Here we go, here we go.

2407
02:42:53,570 --> 02:42:54,450
Begin task?

2408
02:42:58,330 --> 02:42:59,890
Oh, I need more scientists here.

2409
02:43:01,130 --> 02:43:01,510
Alright.

2410
02:43:02,310 --> 02:43:03,290
Alright, they're putting us...

2411
02:43:03,290 --> 02:43:03,930
They're like no more...

2412
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:13,310
handholding now you you know you have to know how to do this
you have to know how to do this so we need genetics so puppy

2413
02:43:13,310 --> 02:43:29,470
puppy is our girl and ban ban actually well Isabella is more
expensive than bin but she's more well-rounded so we'll go

2414
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:30,030
with Isabella

2415
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:38,140
Do I need to do the expedition first?

2416
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:39,580
Let me see.

2417
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:50,460
Oh, it may be.

2418
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:52,940
Oh, it may be like this.

2419
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:54,480
Oh.

2420
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:56,940
Oh, but it's...

2421
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:58,360
We needed to hire these guys anyway.

2422
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,280
Okay, okay.

2423
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:01,880
Oh, my gosh.

2424
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,680
It's like so much.

2425
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:07,280
Take me to Egg Mountain.

2426
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:10,820
All right.

2427
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:13,120
They'll be back in one minute.

2428
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:17,360
I'll just uh chill

2429
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:22,560
We're chilling

2430
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:43,840
Guys our park is one star A little bit more Our profits went
way down when the velociraptor attack happened Oh sorry Yeah

2431
02:44:43,840 --> 02:45:01,250
see our profit our income but then we're back We are so back
video we are so back oh you okay they're fine why

2432
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:12,470
are these guys these guys are walking in the closest group i
have you ever heard of personal space like what is this

2433
02:45:12,470 --> 02:45:25,290
you're literally stepping on her toes you are clipping into
her feet my god dinosaur integration network really good

2434
02:45:25,290 --> 02:45:33,470
friends let's go into the wow this park is like really
beautiful if nothing else that's what I'm saying like if you

2435
02:45:33,470 --> 02:45:41,490
had a Jurassic park in an area that looked like this this is
just like a national park you know like it doesn't even need

2436
02:45:41,490 --> 02:45:42,230
to be

2437
02:45:45,510 --> 02:45:54,910
where's our guys uh oh maybe our viewing area sucks I hear
the oh oh they're trying to oh Oh

2438
02:46:06,650 --> 02:46:07,550
my...

2439
02:46:07,550 --> 02:46:08,090
Hello?

2440
02:46:10,450 --> 02:46:13,470
I feel like the Rangers need some more protection.

2441
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:22,070
During most of your tour, the appropriate information will
be automatically selected and displayed for you.

2442
02:46:22,850 --> 02:46:26,650
Simply touch the area of the screen displaying the
appropriate icon.

2443
02:46:28,110 --> 02:46:28,130
There's a guy.

2444
02:46:28,130 --> 02:46:28,150
Ah!

2445
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:31,490
Boat!

2446
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:36,850
Where'd the goat go?

2447
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:40,470
Poor goat.

2448
02:46:41,670 --> 02:46:42,830
Literally here to die.

2449
02:46:45,410 --> 02:46:45,710
Oh.

2450
02:46:46,150 --> 02:46:46,370
Where?

2451
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:47,730
Where are you pointing at?

2452
02:46:48,630 --> 02:46:49,870
What do you see?

2453
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:50,870
I see a goat.

2454
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:53,710
There he is.

2455
02:46:55,730 --> 02:46:56,130
Uh.

2456
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:03,160
Are velociraptors in this exhibit?

2457
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:07,340
The appropriate information will be automatically selected
and displayed for you.

2458
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:14,960
Simply touch the area of the screen displaying the
appropriate icons I

2459
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:37,420
hear them okay uh r for highlight oh we're missing all the
action there's two of them oh there's guys over here where

2460
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:52,800
were you they're all behind the rocks wait this sucks during
most of your tour I'll just climb it.

2461
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:56,340
I keep trying to press space to jump, you know?

2462
02:47:57,020 --> 02:48:00,020
Keep electrical panel clear at all times.

2463
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:10,130
Yes.

2464
02:48:10,550 --> 02:48:11,470
Good... Oh, they're...

2465
02:48:11,810 --> 02:48:13,470
They're going off the path a little bit.

2466
02:48:13,590 --> 02:48:14,310
Why are you doing that?

2467
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:17,990
Yes.

2468
02:48:18,310 --> 02:48:19,270
Very good.

2469
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:20,230
Can I go in...

2470
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:20,410
Okay.

2471
02:48:21,470 --> 02:48:21,890
Dang it.

2472
02:48:21,950 --> 02:48:23,690
I thought I'd be able to sneak in there.

2473
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:31,820
Here I go!

2474
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:34,580
Where's my velociraptors?

2475
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:35,980
Oh.

2476
02:48:39,400 --> 02:48:40,920
Look how cute!

2477
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:46,800
We should, we, we could get rid of the rocks, you know.

2478
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:50,580
We could probably change the environment so it's easier to
see.

2479
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:53,420
Hi Vicky!

2480
02:48:55,480 --> 02:48:56,540
Hi Peabee!

2481
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:57,080
Hi Peabee!

2482
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:05,000
Mysterious, fourth member.

2483
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:08,440
Where is a Minto?

2484
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:13,400
Minto!

2485
02:49:19,370 --> 02:49:20,350
So perfect.

2486
02:49:20,830 --> 02:49:21,870
Lord Finger!

2487
02:49:22,690 --> 02:49:23,590
Oh, oh, oh.

2488
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:28,570
Oh my god, the sound is annoying.

2489
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:33,330
Alright, we did the complete.

2490
02:49:34,590 --> 02:49:35,470
We can sell.

2491
02:49:36,110 --> 02:49:37,250
And then we can do this.

2492
02:49:38,650 --> 02:49:38,850
in.

2493
02:49:40,930 --> 02:49:41,610
Do I have enough?

2494
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:42,030
Yes.

2495
02:49:42,550 --> 02:49:42,710
Start.

2496
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,530
Alright.

2497
02:49:45,630 --> 02:49:48,010
We are creating males again.

2498
02:49:48,850 --> 02:49:52,470
Thanks for playing Jurassic World Evolution 3, even though I
played a lot of 1 and 2, but haven't had a chance to pick 3

2499
02:49:52,470 --> 02:49:52,670
up.

2500
02:49:53,230 --> 02:49:54,910
3 yet, so it's cool to see gameplay.

2501
02:49:55,730 --> 02:49:58,410
For those who have played 1 or 2...

2502
02:49:58,410 --> 02:50:02,390
We are so close to providing those animals with what they
need.

2503
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:04,390
Keep up your excellent work.

2504
02:50:05,090 --> 02:50:05,570
Thank you!

2505
02:50:06,430 --> 02:50:09,230
We are synthesizing, incubating, and releasing.

2506
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:12,410
Synthesize!

2507
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:14,030
Synthesize!

2508
02:50:16,290 --> 02:50:17,890
Modify Genome.

2509
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:24,050
I can make them...

2510
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:24,790
Random.

2511
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:26,370
Whitgreen.

2512
02:50:27,250 --> 02:50:27,830
Poiple.

2513
02:50:31,390 --> 02:50:32,010
Blank.

2514
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:36,030
Oh, I thought this was like a...

2515
02:50:36,030 --> 02:50:37,510
You can...

2516
02:50:37,510 --> 02:50:38,630
You can...

2517
02:50:38,650 --> 02:50:40,290
Upload your own pattern.

2518
02:50:42,590 --> 02:50:44,930
That would be so funny.

2519
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,060
Random.

2520
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:55,100
What does this mean?

2521
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:57,360
Hmm, interesting.

2522
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:03,900
Begin task.

2523
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:08,700
Start the task.

2524
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:10,960
We are synthesizing.

2525
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:13,920
The survival rate is only 75%.

2526
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:17,800
Yeah, it's all my face.

2527
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,660
It would be so fun if it were, like, you know.

2528
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:26,840
One genetic.

2529
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:27,660
Resilient.

2530
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:29,400
Ooh, yeah, we'll take that.

2531
02:51:31,880 --> 02:51:33,480
Nocturnal and social.

2532
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:36,180
I guess we should do.

2533
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:37,680
Do they want...

2534
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:41,100
All three?

2535
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:45,620
Why can't...

2536
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:47,320
Oh, insufficient skill.

2537
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:48,040
Okay, hold on.

2538
02:51:48,340 --> 02:51:49,880
We gotta hire more people, I think.

2539
02:51:56,730 --> 02:52:01,290
I don't remember what it said we needed, but Michelle has
tons of welfare.

2540
02:52:01,850 --> 02:52:03,250
I think it was welfare, actually, no?

2541
02:52:05,530 --> 02:52:06,610
Dino-itasha.

2542
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:07,230
Exactly!

2543
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:15,630
In the future, animals will have ads on them in zoos.

2544
02:52:17,070 --> 02:52:25,290
You know how sometimes people will like die their dogs pink
instead instead they'll put ads on the animals

2545
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:45,010
okay here we go here we go I don't think we need more
desired population 4 we could probably get away with 2 right

2546
02:52:45,010 --> 02:52:47,350
like probably

2547
02:52:55,480 --> 02:53:00,080
that's messed up I know it is.

2548
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:02,360
All right.

2549
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:06,660
Incubating males in 30 seconds.

2550
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:11,620
The men will drop in 30 seconds.

2551
02:53:13,800 --> 02:53:18,360
Campaigns for 1 and 2 are a little bit different because of
the story narrations, but gameplay-wise, Evolution 3 seems

2552
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:20,420
like overall improvement with more things to play with.

2553
02:53:20,780 --> 02:53:21,640
Oh, that's nice.

2554
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:26,880
Miss Cheetah, brought to you by Spectrum.

2555
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:28,320
Blazing fast internet.

2556
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:31,180
Internet almost as fast as...

2557
02:53:31,180 --> 02:53:33,980
Or... Internet faster than this cheetah.

2558
02:53:37,800 --> 02:53:39,380
Re-dee-su!

2559
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:43,330
Oh, why are the trees like that?

2560
02:53:57,440 --> 02:53:58,220
Oh

2561
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:20,200
He's moonwalking you did it I did it happy they're thriving
and it's all thanks to your hard work Well done with males

2562
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:20,760
in the herd.

2563
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:29,560
We are only a well-placed nest away from helping these
animals start a new lineage gay it's not an objective that i

2564
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:39,480
will set but i will always support breeding dinosaurs
wherever possible this is what we could evolve to look like

2565
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:50,360
going on all fours really great but maybe it's time we take
as much care of our bottom line you see our guests need

2566
02:54:50,360 --> 02:55:00,420
caring for just as much as our animals they need hotels to
sleep in restrooms A comfortable sight draws in more guests.

2567
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:01,460
There's sand everywhere.

2568
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:02,140
They go home.

2569
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:06,020
I'm especially a people with spending money person.

2570
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:13,880
There were guests.

2571
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:14,700
Oh, yeah.

2572
02:55:15,060 --> 02:55:15,340
Time to...

2573
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:16,260
Oh, a hotel?

2574
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:23,960
Small hotels provide accommodation for guests and provide
close distance dinosaur visibility.

2575
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:27,220
Small shopping amenity.

2576
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:30,160
All right.

2577
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:30,980
All right.

2578
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,180
I'll give you a bathroom, little people.

2579
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:35,700
You get one as a treat.

2580
02:55:38,640 --> 02:55:40,820
I love the announcement.

2581
02:55:41,820 --> 02:55:44,320
Ladies, I'm with when nature calls.

2582
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:49,480
Ladies and gentlemen, we opened a new attraction.

2583
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:52,860
Please peruse our bathroom.

2584
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:56,600
Accommodation rating.

2585
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:00,980
Hell, I think we could do even more.

2586
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:22,220
bathrooms even one right here crazy I know we should be yes
to dinosaurs what else you want a small hotel oh wow oh my

2587
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:33,620
god you get to see in the middle of the park you get the
restroom view Look at there's a pool on the top!

2588
02:56:38,650 --> 02:56:40,910
Oh my god, whoever's driving that car.

2589
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:42,890
Oh, I think you couldn't see it.

2590
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:46,050
My head was blocking the way, but they were being nuts.

2591
02:56:52,180 --> 02:56:54,180
We'll give them a fancy path.

2592
02:56:59,490 --> 02:57:04,090
Ladies and gentlemen, for your comfort, we've increased the
hotel.

2593
02:57:04,150 --> 02:57:05,970
Looking good so far.

2594
02:57:06,930 --> 02:57:14,650
FYI, we've got number crunchers behind-the-scenes collecting
info on the site's appeal how guests are feeling and my

2595
02:57:14,650 --> 02:57:31,090
favorite bit our amenity sales take a look i'm looking
income per minute 11 our economy is three oh those amenity

2596
02:57:31,090 --> 02:57:40,150
sales could be a lot less red how sites like this one make
money is pretty straightforward see If we have incredible

2597
02:57:40,150 --> 02:57:44,970
animals on site and the guests can see them, then we'll sell
plenty of entry tickets.

2598
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:52,390
And as long as we keep our guests comfortable and make sure
they approve of what we're doing, we'll sell even more entry

2599
02:57:52,390 --> 02:57:52,790
tickets.

2600
02:57:52,890 --> 02:57:53,870
Yeah, we're almost two stars!

2601
02:57:53,910 --> 02:57:59,350
That's when we hit them with some excellent food, drinks,
and shopping amenities to really bump up our income.

2602
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:04,670
As we seem to be lacking in the amenities department right
now, we should really get that fixed.

2603
02:58:06,210 --> 02:58:07,250
More food!

2604
02:58:09,270 --> 02:58:17,550
more you know i created din to support dinosaurs and bring
people joy oh here we go and there's nothing more joyful

2605
02:58:17,550 --> 02:58:26,430
than good food good drinks and reasonably priced merchandise
oh think of the site's profits as a measurement of joy i'll

2606
02:58:26,430 --> 02:58:34,370
put it all over here by the velocirat oh we can't profits go
up and needless to say that's the direction that profits

2607
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:35,570
should be going in

2608
02:58:39,010 --> 02:58:40,850
But you're not shooting in the dark.

2609
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:47,890
Our dated geniuses will show you in real time how different
products or features will impact guest satisfaction.

2610
02:58:48,390 --> 02:58:50,930
And how that equals more profit.

2611
02:58:52,970 --> 02:58:54,450
Here, here, get your...

2612
02:58:54,450 --> 02:58:59,770
Oh, amenities can be configured to sell specific products.

2613
02:59:00,430 --> 02:59:02,110
Better than match, the higher its income.

2614
02:59:03,710 --> 02:59:06,850
Blab, blab, blab, blab, the business talk, the business
talk.

2615
02:59:13,430 --> 02:59:13,870
Um...

2616
02:59:14,950 --> 02:59:15,870
What are they doing?

2617
02:59:16,550 --> 02:59:19,030
Oh, they're inspecting the small amenity, too.

2618
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:24,830
Okay, and next we do, uh, drinks.

2619
02:59:25,610 --> 02:59:29,430
I probably should have put the drinks by the food, but...

2620
02:59:29,430 --> 02:59:30,750
Oh, we could still do that.

2621
02:59:32,910 --> 02:59:33,350
Uh...

2622
02:59:33,850 --> 02:59:36,090
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2623
02:59:36,550 --> 02:59:38,990
You just walk a little ways away, and you'll get a nice
refresh.

2624
02:59:39,010 --> 02:59:40,510
refreshing drink by the Velasa.

2625
02:59:40,830 --> 02:59:41,650
Come by!

2626
02:59:43,270 --> 02:59:43,910
Velasa...

2627
02:59:48,490 --> 02:59:49,130
Velasa...

2628
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:50,490
drank.

2629
02:59:52,330 --> 02:59:53,390
The Velasa drank.

2630
02:59:59,130 --> 03:00:02,160
And here...

2631
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:03,320
is the...

2632
03:00:03,320 --> 03:00:05,200
You could change the drink type so you can.

2633
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:07,760
Change product.

2634
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:09,800
To...

2635
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:11,440
What the heck is a kefir?

2636
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:14,320
It's gonna be energy!

2637
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:16,520
Drink.

2638
03:00:18,680 --> 03:00:19,560
Change features.

2639
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:20,480
Claw!

2640
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:21,340
Oh, claw.

2641
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:22,360
Jukebox.

2642
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:27,600
Jukebox.

2643
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:28,540
Oh, yeah, baby.

2644
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:30,480
And also...

2645
03:00:30,480 --> 03:00:32,060
You're not gonna believe what I found.

2646
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:35,800
Well, okay, my lawyers pointed it out to me, but same thing.

2647
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:36,820
A fish tank.

2648
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:38,740
We have more land than I thought.

2649
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:41,160
I trust it'll be put to good use.

2650
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:43,040
Oh, is it?

2651
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:43,620
That sounds good.

2652
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:55,080
and more revenue wink wink wink oh whoa what just happened
oh my god oh oh yes yes i wasn't paying attention to what he

2653
03:00:55,080 --> 03:01:04,420
said yes more room while this particular site is owned by mr
finch i thought it best to still define some specific

2654
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:20,580
targets to work towards hold on i'm busy oh total scientist
skills 50 income per minute five $500,000 per minute number

2655
03:01:29,630 --> 03:01:38,570
of animals 50 number of guests 1,000 how expensive are these
tickets that we would with 1,000 guests is we are making

2656
03:01:38,570 --> 03:01:46,510
$500,000 I got run over by cute mid but the dinosaurs were
cool and the food was great despite being run over it was a

2657
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:53,590
solid five out of five experience we'll return thank you so
much for your very honest review Um,

2658
03:01:56,730 --> 03:02:01,050
the getting run over is definitely in a, it's a perk of our
park.

2659
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:08,670
We definitely advertise as a hands-on experience and a
wheels-on experience.

2660
03:02:09,710 --> 03:02:13,790
So I would really appreciate if you could edit your score to
a six out of five.

2661
03:02:14,370 --> 03:02:15,210
Thank you.

2662
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:27,180
Remember, satisfying these goals will define this site's
overall park rating.

2663
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:35,800
ratings prove that we can manage sites and make clients
happy we hit two stars which helps me expand din globally

2664
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:46,540
nice let's see hold on i'm working on our velasa drink i
cannot believe the momentum that din has suddenly gained

2665
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:54,920
kira nobody likes it though people don't like it they want
the energy drink i think securing a new site now follow my

2666
03:02:54,920 --> 03:03:00,700
advice on increasing our reputation and park ratings, and
our proposition will be irresistible.

2667
03:03:01,720 --> 03:03:02,240
Oh, quick.

2668
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:03,740
That way, this is...

2669
03:03:03,740 --> 03:03:05,640
You guys, look at this logo.

2670
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:08,500
That's so stinking cute.

2671
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:10,900
Wait, it's sushi right now.

2672
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:12,280
Yummy.

2673
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:13,700
I want sushi.

2674
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:15,420
I want sushi.

2675
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:18,260

2676
03:03:18,600 --> 03:03:19,540
Sounds so yummy.

2677
03:03:20,740 --> 03:03:22,540
That's a cute logo.

2678
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:26,200
Filofle wraps.

2679
03:03:26,720 --> 03:03:28,280
Oh, I'm hungry.

2680
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:31,240
Guys, I'm kind of hungry.

2681
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:36,220
The conservation sector have asked me to keep an eye on Din
long term.

2682
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:38,960
So consider me an official advisor.

2683
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:47,100
And on that topic, your reputation with the conservation
sector would only improve if we had more naturally bred

2684
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:48,400
dinosaurs on site.

2685
03:03:48,660 --> 03:03:50,320
Oh, okay.

2686
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:51,600
Cool.

2687
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:53,840
Um...

2688
03:03:55,060 --> 03:03:56,700

.

2712
03:05:22,530 --> 03:05:23,090
.

2713
03:05:25,090 --> 03:05:25,890

2714
03:05:25,890 --> 03:05:26,150

2727
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:48,600
Can you see me?

2728
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:49,580

Oh, wait, I think he's gonna...

2730
03:06:51,620 --> 03:06:53,000
I think he's gonna step on us.

2731
03:06:55,840 --> 03:07:00,900
Well, oh no, we're getting full tail view right now.

2732
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:04,160
