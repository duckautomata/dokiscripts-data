1
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,470
Ah, ah.

2
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,930
Welcome back, Master.

3
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,130
Hello, hello, hello.

4
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,130
I can't decide.

5
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,930
I was trying to go for a sneaking suit style, but I feel that...

6
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,810
Wait, wait, wait.

7
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,610
The music will get so loud.

8
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,690
Hold on.

9
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,370
I want to talk more before we watch this.

10
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,710
Hold on!

11
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,570
Oh, there we go.

12
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,910
I can't decide if I want to have dark hair only.

13
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,470
I can't decide.

14
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,590
Nah, we'll go with this.

15
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,610
We'll go with sneaking suit version.

16
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,270
Sneaking maid version.

17
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,790
Full dark?

18
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,570
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,570
I also couldn't tell if I go with my normal hair.

20
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,690
My normal hair, I feel like kind of...

21
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,630
OK, this might be my Delulu speaking.

22
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,290
But I kind of look like Boss.

23
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,110
OK, but you have to see...

24
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,470
OK, hold on.

25
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,030
I'm going to put myself right next to him.

26
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,570
He's going to go... OK, hold on.

27
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,790
You have to understand.

28
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,910
Hold on.

29
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,890
Look, look, look.

30
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,810
He's going to show up any second now.

31
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,310
Oh Big Boss!

32
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,570
Oh Big Boss!

33
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,430
Oh there he is!

34
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,030
See, I kind of look like him.

35
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,290
Oh my God!

36
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,330
Pacific Ocean!

37
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,800
Oh my God, that's going to be us.

38
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,300
Yeah, my favorite useless character!

39
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,660
Yeah, Strangelove!

40
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,950
My favorite dumb name!

41
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,470
Oh my God, that's going to be us.

42
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,850
Oh my God.

43
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,710
Oh my God, that's going to be us.

44
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,870
BGM is so good.

45
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,850
I also... Did I do my intro?

46
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,070
I can't remember.

47
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,170
Sorry, I'm too excited.

48
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,670
What I wanted to say though is that I love this menu here.

49
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,370
I feel like it really sets the tone of how Peace Walker is.

50
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,710
It's kind of spooky.

51
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,330
It's mysterious.

52
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,570
It's a little dark.

53
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,170
It's like...

54
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,350
But...

55
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,630
It's so good.

56
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,210
The 70s.

57
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,470
Yeah.

58
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,350
I pressed the start button.

59
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,150
I wonder if it worked.

60
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,990
Nope.

61
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,350
Peace amongst men living alongside one another is not a natural state.

62
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,350
On the contrary, the natural state of man is that of war.

63
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,810
I can't read fast.

64
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,110
Amongst.

65
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,250
I do want to say...

66
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,870
Obviously, no spoilers.

67
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,270
I feel this game has many, many spoilers.

68
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,090
Yeah!

69
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,730
Yeah!

70
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,990
Watch it one more time!

71
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,370
One more time!

72
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,590
I love you, Pies!

73
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,030
I love you so much!

74
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,470
I'll never... Nobody can make you hate... Wait.

75
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,450
Nobody can ever make me hate you.

76
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,810
I love you, Pies.

77
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,950
I love you the mostest ever.

78
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,990
Oh, Cecile!

79
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,530
The girl who literally said...

80
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:59,590
I don't know what the heck you guys are doing here and I'm not involved anymore.

81
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,190
She's so... She's...

82
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,990
That little skip.

83
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,150
She literally says...

84
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,870
I'm out.

85
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,450
I have nothing to do with this.

86
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,230
And never...

87
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,870
And never...

88
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,290
It's never heard from again.

89
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,210
Can I get a birthday from my totally not Oshie?

90
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,290
If you're gonna say it like that...

91
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,870
I mean...

92
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,950
If you're gonna say it like that...

93
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,890
You don't sound very appreciative of my birthday.

94
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,560
But I guess I'll sing happy birthday for you.

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,780
Happy birthday to you!

96
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,220
Happy birthday to you!

97
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,040
Happy birthday, dear fool!

98
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,780
Happy birthday to you!

99
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
Happy birthday!

100
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,120
Sorry, I feel like my brain is all over the place.

101
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Because I didn't stream yesterday and I'm all like...

102
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,120
If you're like BB, does that mean you'll be in a speedo?

103
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,220
If I'm lucky.

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,260
Is your sync okay?

105
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,860
Yeah, I have to talk about that.

106
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,660
Basically, my sync broke and I can't use it.

107
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Basically, right now it overflows.

108
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,200
It does not drain the water.

109
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,200
And the dish drainer stops working.

110
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
Or the disposal thing.

111
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
The thing that goes...

112
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,220
And gets rid of all the food.

113
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,720
And when it does start to drain, it leaks all over.

114
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,920
Yeah, and they actually have come to fix this before.

115
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,740
And so, now they have to do it again.

116
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,940
Go away Xbox!

117
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
So, it's so annoying.

118
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,560
And it smells really bad and I'm upset about it.

119
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,920
But I put in like a maintenance thing.

120
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
And I was like, okay, someone will come to the maid cafe today.

121
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,840
For sure.

122
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,200
And I checked yesterday and I was like, it definitely says that they're gonna come to the maid cafe.

123
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,400
And then I checked this morning because they did not come to the maid cafe.

124
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,540
And I checked this morning and it was gone!

125
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,980
So I have to...

126
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,340
I have to do it again.

127
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,860
I can't wash my dishes.

128
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,080
Dishes.

129
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,400
So they didn't show up yesterday at all?

130
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,740
Nope!

131
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,260
That was a big old waste of my time.

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,360
Wash them in the toilet.

133
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,140
Such a good idea.

134
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,760
Such a good idea.

135
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,460
Hope co-op works for you.

136
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
Xbox is giving me problems.

137
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,380
Really?

138
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,560
I saw some people...

139
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,200
So, for anybody who's just like, why is she doing the Xbox over the PlayStation?

140
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,740
I decided because, you know...

141
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,700
Previously I've seen other Vtubers play Peace Walker and it was on the PlayStation.

142
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,260
And I thought, you know, not everybody maybe still has a PS3.

143
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,740
And also you can still technically buy this on the Xbox.

144
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,360
So...

145
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,940
I was like, you know, we'll just switch it up a little bit.

146
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,440
And...

147
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,420
But...

148
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,140
Sorry, I almost spilled my water.

149
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,320
But, if it...

150
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,060
If...

151
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,340
Maybe less people show up for this one instead?

152
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,500
Well, we can always switch back.

153
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,080
I don't know.

154
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,200
I don't know.

155
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,300
Honestly, it's been something that's been like...

156
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,300
Been like in my brain because so many people are...

157
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,120
Conflicting things and are just like, oh, I wish you were playing on this one instead.

158
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,460
But, I can't please everybody.

159
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,960
I can only do one or the other.

161
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,760
So, I'm sorry, okay?

162
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,220
Yes, so, I'm doing my best out here, please.

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,440
Jester, happy birthday!

164
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,300
Happy birthday to you.

165
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,200
Happy birthday to you.

166
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,220
Happy birthday, dear Jester.

167
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,020
Happy birthday to you.

168
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,820
Happy birthday!

169
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,420
If you're a dog, I hope you're not drinking.

170
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,640
21 years is really old for dog years.

171
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,840
I can't believe the streamer isn't playing on PlayStation, Xbox and PSP simultaneously.

172
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,920
I know!

173
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,540
Can you believe it?

174
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
She's falling off.

175
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,660
We can play the other next year.

176
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,660
Why?

177
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,120
Why?

178
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,660
No!

179
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,340
Please play on PSP.

180
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,820
Bust out my...

181
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,660
I've had to do that though.

182
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,620
I had to finagle a situation for portable ops before.

183
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,320
Anyway, let's see.

184
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,660
This is gonna be weird though, because...

185
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,420
What if I made it really small?

186
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,380
This is gonna be weird playing.

187
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,980
It's my first time playing a Metal Gear game on Xbox.

188
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,940
So, I'm kind of scared about the controls, I'm not gonna lie.

189
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,960
We'll see though.

190
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,800
Press A to apply.

191
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,260
Oh gosh, why?

192
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:18,720
OK.

193
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,940
We'll do here?

194
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,620
That's good.

195
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,860
Oh,

196
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,500
I think I was testing it.

197
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,300
New game!

198
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's go.

199
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm not gonna have all my stuff.

200
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,260
It's gonna be so sad.

201
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,040
It's gonna be so sad.

202
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,140
Birthday was 6 days ago.

203
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,000
I know it's a bit late, but what if I told you I'm now 27 years old.

204
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,120
Solid Snake in Metal Gear 2 Zanzibar Land.

205
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,520
Rodan, happy birthday!

206
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,020
Happy birthday to you.

207
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,980
Happy birthday to you.

208
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,500
Happy birthday dear Rodan, Zanzibar Land.

209
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Happy birthday to you.

210
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,180
Happy birthday!

211
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
I did mention earlier.

212
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,380
No spoilers, because this game has a lot of cool story stuff.

213
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,440
Recently... Oh my gosh, you guys.

214
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,820
Recently, I've been seeing some Peace Walker slander on my timeline on Twitter.

215
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,500
And it's making... I'm like...

216
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm like, excuse me?

217
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,160
Of all the things.

218
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,680
Of all the things.

219
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,260
Peace Walker!

220
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't understand.

221
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,500
I saw there was one post that I saw.

222
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,980
That showed up in my For You page or whatever.

223
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,420
That was like...

224
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,500
It was like a video.

225
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,100
It was a screenshot of a video.

226
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,940
I guess a video or a short, whatever, on YouTube.

227
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,260
And someone commenting being like...

228
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,440
Hey, you didn't include Peace Walker in this list.

229
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't know what the video was.

230
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
But then the person who made the video responded and said...

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,780
Yeah, because I only included games that were a part of the canon.

232
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,620
And I'm like...

233
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,140
Huh?

234
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,560
What are you talking about?

235
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,720
How is this game...

236
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,060
How do you play Five without Peace Walker?

237
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,700
I saw that too.

238
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,060
Yeah, I think it probably showed up in some people's...

239
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,920
I get a bunch of Metal Gear posts.

240
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,720
So if I get them and you also like Metal Gear stuff, you probably see them too.

241
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,780
Five literally follows Peace Walker.

242
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,360
I don't understand the logic.

243
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,800
I feel like Peace Walker is honestly Metal Gear Solid 5.

244
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,820
It wasn't supposed to be, technically.

245
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,180
But it's like the limitations of PSP...

246
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,220
Metal Gear fans are so silly.

247
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,340
Did they confuse it with Poops?

248
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,100
I don't know.

249
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,620
Maybe.

250
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,780
Maybe really.

251
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,360
Those PSP games, they're all the same, right?

252
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,420
Those PSP games.

253
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,160
It is.

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,760
MGSV is V, not 5.

255
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,260
Oh yeah, I switch between saying V and 5 all the time.

256
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,580
Fans as silly as the series.

257
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,920
I know, right?

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,380
Why does this game offer a Monster Hunter Control Type?

259
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,620
That's... You'll see!

260
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,040
Yeah, we have to select Shooter Type, Action Type.

261
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Similar to that of MGS4.

262
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,580
Of course, we're going to go with Monster Hunter Type.

263
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
No, I'm just kidding.

264
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,380
How would...

265
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,320
Yeah, Shooter Type.

266
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,960
What is the Hunter Type anyway?

267
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,280
Move.

268
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,580
Reset Camera.

269
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,220
Select Item.

270
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,680
Right Trigger is just not used.

271
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
Select Weapon.

272
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,740
Oh, I thought... Oh gosh.

273
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,460
Auto Aim Switch.

274
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Display Menu.

275
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,720
Crouch.

276
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
How is it so different?

277
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,240
Melee Attack.

278
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,980
Or Auto Aim.

279
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,080
And that... Oh my goodness, actually there's so much.

280
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Auto Aim Switch.

281
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,200
You can press either X or...

282
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,060
Wait, what's Melee Attack here then?

283
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,300
How do I CQC?

284
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,980
Oh, R.

285
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,080
RT, RT.

286
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,360
Interesting.

287
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,440
So a piece walked on this phantom day.

288
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Yeah, pretty much.

289
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,840
This is so strange.

290
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,960
But also it's Aim Weapon or Attack.

291
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,860
And then also...

292
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,600
Melee Attack or Cancel Aim.

293
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,720
I guess for anybody playing Monster Hunter Wilds...

294
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,080
You might want to choose the Hunter type, perhaps.

295
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,380
I have Monster Hunter Wilds.

296
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,340
Actually, I got sent a...

297
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,780
I don't know if you guys saw...

298
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,640
If you guys saw Doki Birds.

299
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,540
She posted like a box that she got from Capcom.

300
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,660
I got the same thing, I just have to set it up and make it look nice and take a picture.

301
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,620
Oh my gosh, it's so cool.

302
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,400
It's probably... Well, not to say that I've gotten any PR packages.

303
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,440
I've only... Actually, this is only my second one.

304
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,080
But I feel like it will probably be the coolest one I've ever had.

305
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,260
It's actually right next to my computer right now, so I can look at it.

306
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,660
It's a real like...

307
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,700
It's like a real wooden box.

308
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,260
I don't know if you can hear it.

309
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,560
It's like a big wooden crate, almost.

310
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,440
And then...

311
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,320
It has... It came with a jacket.

312
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,360
Like a really nice fleece lined...

313
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,120
Like... Hold on, what does it say on it?

314
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,070
I gotta get it.

315
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,900
Oh my god, it's so heavy.

316
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,360
It says...

317
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,680
It says...

318
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Forbidden Lands Expedition Team.

319
00:20:59,620 --> 00:20:59,980
Hold on.

320
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,800
And it came with a plushie.

321
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,300
And it came with like some little cards.

322
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,200
That show like the different units.

323
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,020
Or characters from the units.

324
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,000
So it has like the Palico, and Gemma, and Alma.

325
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,420
I don't know those characters, I'm sorry.

326
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,960
And then...

327
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,860
It also came with like this big...

328
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,100
Like, oh my gosh, if I was a LARPer, if I were a LARPer, this would be like a dream come true for me.

329
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,120
It came with like a little necklace.

330
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,820
I don't know if you can hear that.

331
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,300
It came with like a... It looks... It's kind of like a...

332
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,260
What do you say?

333
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,540
Clay?

334
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,000
It seems so rustic.

335
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,900
And then...

336
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,800
A big like leather bound book.

337
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,620
And all the pages.

338
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,080
All the pages.

339
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,860
Is it white stone?

340
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,340
Yes, yes, it's a white stone.

341
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,440
It's a white stone.

342
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,440
And then like a big book.

343
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,380
That is actually like a book.

344
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,600
I'll have to take pictures of it later.

345
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,120
Like, the book has like pages that I could write in.

346
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,280
Like, again, if I were a LARPer, I would be the happiest person ever.

347
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,000
And it also came with...

348
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,240
It came with so much stuff.

349
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm also kind of like, where do I put all this?

350
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,240
It came with a little leather pouch.

351
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,600
Did I have any... And...

352
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,520
I think... I think this is...

353
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,940
Oh, yeah, it just has a...

354
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,720
It came with a little leather pouch.

355
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,820
And it also came with a tapestry.

356
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
That says Mint Phantom on it.

357
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,920
So it's like crazy.

358
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,200
It's so... I will take a picture of it.

359
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,180
Personalized?

360
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's personalized.

361
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,900
I was so excited when I got the email.

362
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,880
I was like, yo!

363
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,380
So now I have an Ace Attorney... Ace Attorney gavel with my name on it.

364
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,880
Now I have a Monster Hunter tapestry with my name on it.

365
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,220
I was like, Capcom loves me or something.

366
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,220
Oh my gosh, thank you, Capcom.

367
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,900
Not spon...

368
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,660
Well, this, I guess... Sponsored?

369
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,560
Not really.

370
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, it's so cool though.

371
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,540
I was happy.

372
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,540
I think I saw a couple... I think Snuffy got one too.

373
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,660
Maybe Limel?

374
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,300
I know Limel got a... She had like a stream.

375
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,620
She got like a Monster Hunter outfit, which is so cool.

376
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,340
Anyway, sorry, I'm done napping.

377
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,000
Not action type.

378
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,020
Shooter type.

379
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,030
Whatever.

380
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,350
Whatever.

381
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,570
Not sponsored, but loved by.

382
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,310
Maybe.

383
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,690
Like I said, I gotta take a nice picture of it.

384
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,550
The year was 1964.

385
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,750
The world was firmly in the grip of the Cold War, divided into East and West.

386
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,530
One of America's heroes had defected to the Soviet Union.

387
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,870
The Boss.

388
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,200
She was known as the Boss, the mother of the Special Forces, and the soldier said to have led the Allies to victory in World War II.

389
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,360
However, the American-made miniature nuclear warhead she took with her was used to destroy a Soviet research facility.

390
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,180
Bogan.

391
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,200
Facing full-scale nuclear war, the leaders of the world's superpowers held top-secret talks to avert Armageddon.

392
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,860
The Soviet Union wanted assurance that this was not the work of Uncle Sam.

393
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,040
They wanted America to eliminate one of the most legendary soldiers.

394
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,200
The Boss.

395
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,840
The person assigned this mission was her closest apprentice, the soldier known as Snake.

396
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:08,320
Snake made the anguished journey into enemy territory, eventually confronting and killing the Boss at a fortress called Groznygrad, proving America's innocence in avoiding nuclear or something something.

397
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,960
Having saved the world, Snake was hailed a true hero and given the title, Big Boss.

398
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,850
Following the award ceremony, however, Snake disappeared.

399
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,320
Yeah, he left those fake-ass people.

400
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
He said, nah, I don't want anything to do with it.

401
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,880
Oh my god.

402
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,180
There better not be some men on the beach.

403
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,220
I might lose it.

404
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,320
We're in Columbia.

405
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,960
Whisper Randolph.

406
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,970
It's raining.

407
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,750
Soldiers without borders!

408
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,510
MSF!

409
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,530
Mitos without borders.

410
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,350
Sorry, I was blocking the date.

411
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,930
It was November 4th, 1974.

412
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,250
1974.

413
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,170
Men on the beach!

414
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,050
I love Top Gun!

415
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,100
This camera, this shaking cam is going nutso right now.

416
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,260
That's me too when I say I'm Boss!

417
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,320
Boss!

418
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,740
White day is over, today is fight day.

419
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,060
Free control time.

420
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,080
Oh my god, I clipped so much into him.

421
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,120
I'll let you go.

422
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,340
I'll let you go, little guy.

423
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,000
This is us waiting for Mito to escape.

424
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,360
Show them how it's done, Boss!

425
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,060
Ok!

426
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,620
Ok!

427
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,420
I don't...

428
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,860
I am!

429
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,540
Why?

430
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,380
I don't take orders from anybody!

431
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,940
Such a silly tutorial.

432
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,060
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

433
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Thanks for that, Boss.

434
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,260
They're not as...

435
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,860
Oh no, I was ready, I'm sorry!

436
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,640
You're on the right!

437
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,180
You're on the right!

438
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,810
They're not as obedient or like as...

439
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,560
Grateful, that's the word.

440
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,890
As they are...

441
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,000
In...

442
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,560
Finally!

443
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:22,740
Oh, crouch a lot.

444
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,560
It's like real combat training.

445
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,840
Yes sir!

446
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,420
It's such a strange thing to get used to though.

447
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,220
I'm moving while I'm crouching.

448
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm holding it down.

449
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,400
Good!

450
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,220
No more, no more humping the ground.

451
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,720
Be careful!

452
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,020
Good!

453
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,240
Woohoo!

454
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,060
Again!

455
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,260
I got that!

456
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,740
Don't forget it!

457
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,020
Oh, I can't touch them.

458
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,900
Wait, wait.

459
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,860
Stand up.

460
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,460
Oh, there we go.

461
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,280
That's it!

462
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,040
No, I would never.

463
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,480
OK Repeatedly!

464
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,720
Is that guy you too?

465
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,420
Come on!

466
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,790
Yep, I'm the best ever doing it.

467
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,420
A million?

468
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,620
Or dead?

469
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah, it's raining.

470
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,320
He would have died.

471
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,120
This guy is so ready.

472
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Good acting!

473
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,060
OK, Mr. Krabs over here.

474
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:10,680
They are like, make boss feel really good about himself, OK?

475
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,860
Oh!

476
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,520
Yeah!

477
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,120
I love doing that!

478
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
Throwing!

479
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh my God!

480
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,640
Thank you!

481
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,420
He said he's dead!

482
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,080
I'm ready boss!

483
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,960
In a neurotic way?

484
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,620
OK Alright!

485
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,000
Go!

486
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm ready boss!

487
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,840
Wait,

488
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,780
what am I doing?

489
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,580
Oh, OK Come here baby!

490
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,460
Thank you!

491
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,760
That's when you do the Russian twine.

492
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,740
OK

493
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,420
Oh gosh, I have to aim now too?

494
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,900
Again!

495
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,700
I'm ready boss!

496
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,720
Come here!

497
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,260
Come here!

498
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,620
Oh, whoopsie.

499
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,180
I messed up.

500
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Sorry!

501
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,480
Sorry!

502
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,220
Come here!

503
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,640
Oh, I can't aim!

504
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,700
Wake up!

505
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,080
Wake up!

506
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,440
Wake up!

507
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,720
I'm trying!

508
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,220
But I can't aim!

509
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,640
There we go

510
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,540
I can't aim!

511
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,180
Everybody...everybody steps forward When you're surrounded by multiple enemies, you'll have to take them on one after the other.

512
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,200
Steven Seagal did fake karate

513
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,940
Alright, everybody...I'm ready boss!

514
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,240
What am I doing?

515
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh, OK

516
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,740
Oh, next!

517
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,400
There we go.

518
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh, we're doing our little sequence.

519
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,200
OK I did it!

520
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,220
I did it!

521
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,560
Oh, you have to do it with all three.

522
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, no flipping.

523
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,500
OK, OK, OK Next Next

524
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,360
Good?

525
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,700
Yippee!

526
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:18,460
Oh, everybody's got to get their shot Oh, dammit Wake up!

527

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,060
Next!

529
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,420
Boss, press the attack button when the icon appears

530
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
Blue eyes and bows?

531
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,920
I don't have to have blue eyes

532
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,370
Snake!

533
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
Look at him brooding.

534
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,840
This man believes in Santa Claus Snake!

535
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,180
Snake!

536
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:24,800

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,110
Ashley?

540
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,350
Ashley Wood.

541
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,050
Yes, thank you.

542
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,650
I thought it was Wood, but I didn't want to be wrong

543
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,010
Oh my God, see?

544
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,210
Yummy

545
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,690
Peace Galvez Galvez Rocket Peace

546
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,130
He's just smiling The army as a permanent institution is abolished.

547
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,450
The peace constitution.

548
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,370
Best girl, best girl!

549
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,550
Yeah, Spike Spiegel.

550
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,470
No, no, they don't appear to be guerillas.

551
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,430
They're far too organized.

552
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,130
What's your government's take?

553
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,150
The authorities in San Jose claim it's a multinational security firm.

554
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,110
Hired by the Development Corporation of Costa Rica.

555
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,210
Lies, obviously.

556
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,190
They're bringing in state-of-the-art weaponry and equipment by the shipload.

557
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,150
Where'd they get that kind of cash?

558
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,850
I fear La Silla may be...

559
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,910
La Silla!

560
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,450
The CIA.

561
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:46,610
As you both know, the United States views Central America as its backyard.

562
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:53,210
Even after Cuba, we've managed to maintain a delicate balance with the U.S.

563
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,810
And your government can't just give them the boot?

564
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,550
We are not allowed to bear arms.

565
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,870
Oh no, they have no bear arms.

566
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,570
Japan's constitution has something similar.

567
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,650
Article 9.

568
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,870
It says Japan renounces war and can't maintain an army.

569
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,210
I understand that you and your men have neither state nor ideology.

570
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,630
That you will fight any foe.

571
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,830
Please, you must drive them out of our defenseless country.

572
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,490
We come to you, the Militaire Sans Frontieres.

573
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,810
Militaire Sans Frontieres.

574
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,770
Yes, as our deterrent.

575
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,350
We can't afford to pay much, it's true.

576
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:43,710
But...

577
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,470
We can offer you this.

578
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,150
Yeah, baby!

579
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,910
An offshore plant in the Caribbean.

580
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,970
It's home!

581
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,010
Sounds pretty good to me.

582
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,850
This place is becoming a mess anyway.

583
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,790
Snake, we need some place we can settle down.

584
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,370
He wants to be a housewife.

585
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,870
Unofficially, of course.

586
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,870
A shopper for transport would be nice too.

587
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,430
Snake, I want to settle down now.

588
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,250
Come on!

589
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,290
You seem to think we are just a pack of dogs of war.

590
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,450
Is that right?

591
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,510
He wants to settle down.

592
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,730
You are an army without a state.

593
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,710
No, we've only left our countries behind.

594
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,430
Please, you must help us.

595
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,090
If your suspicions are true, force isn't going to do any good.

596
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,370
You'll have to find a political solution.

597
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,270
The government's hands are tied.

598
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,850
Go back to your bosses in San Jose.

599
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,050
Tell them what they want, I'll introduce them to a negotiator I know.

600
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,930
No, I'm not here on their behalf.

601
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,070
So, what are you doing here?

602
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:56,470
For over 20 years, I've preached the virtues of peace at multiple universities.

603
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,210
Tonight, I stand before you as an educator.

604
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,570
She's so cute!

605
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,370
She came to me to study peace.

606
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,810
Her name is Paz.

607
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,710
Paz Ortega.

608
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,090
Paz Ortega, I love you!

609
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,950
Paz.

610
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,790
Peace.

611
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,010
I love you so much.

612
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,290
I love you.

613
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:16,670
No kidding.

614
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,550
That's my name too.

615
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,510
No, you're Kaz.

616
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:36,030
I love this Golden Retriever boy.

617
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,110
Paz.

618
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,550
Call me Kaz.

619
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,710
Paz stumbled upon that facility while searching for a lost friend.

620
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,390
Rizla's Kaz.

621
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,450
She's only a child.

622
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,530
16 years old.

623
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,310
They did terrible things to her.

624
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,050
But somehow she managed to escape.

625
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,890
Thank God.

626
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,690
She's so cute!

627
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,610
Her mother died when she was small.

628
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,310
Thank you Kojima.

629
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,910
Hideo Kojima, everybody.

630
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,410
She hates war with a passion like no other.

631
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,030
My name is Paz.

632
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,010
And I will do anything to protect my namesake.

633
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,570
It is my one and only purpose.

634
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,310
Please, get them out of my country.

635
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,530
Make them leave Costa Rica.

636
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,970
Sorry kid, we know who you are, big boss.

637
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,350
That is why we've come to you.

638
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,400
Prologue in Army.

639
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,320
I love this game so much.

640
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,840
Even with how serious it is, it's still so silly.

641
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,760
It's like, it's the last game to be so silly.

642
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,540
At the same time, you know.

643
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,840
Hello!

644
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,540
Ok.

645
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,000
Ok.

646
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,820
Bye.

647
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,000
I will.

648
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,700
They are really adamant about that.

649
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,000
They're like, hey, you know...

650
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,680
This beach looks so familiar.

651
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,480
Like we're gonna have some...

652
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,840
Some dates here.

653
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,420
Wait, can I?

654
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
Is there a first person?

655
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,200
That's what I'm doing!

656
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,240
A coconut?

657
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,780
LB.

658
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,140
Ok.

659
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,080
Ok.

660
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,600
Oh my god!

661
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,080
We get it!

662
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,280
Guys, please!

663
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,300
Holy moly.

664
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,900
Guy won't shut up.

665
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,000
Ok.

666
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,180
I would never.

667
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,460
I would never do that.

668
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,820
What are you talking about?

669
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,480
You can't crawl though.

670
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,460
Ok!

671
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,380
My depth perception.

672
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:34,990
Ok!

673
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,770
What do you want me to do, huh?

674
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,330
Don't you think you could hear...

675
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,050
What are you saying?

676
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,650
I'm bad?

677
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,750
I literally just double headshot these dummies.

678
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,790
I got the coconut.

679
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,390
Oh wow, there's even more stuff.

680
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,090
Backseater energy.

681
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:51,950
I know!

682
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,610
Come on!

683
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,850
I've played these games before!

684
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:05,590
It is good to kind of get used to this again.

685
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:06,570
What is this one?

686
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,510
Oh, surround indicator.

687
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,790
And we got ration.

688
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,350
Yeah, I forgot there's no...

689
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:21,210
This game is back to having no radar, unfortunately.

690
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,610
Getting used to the Xbox controller.

691
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:25,090
I know!

692
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,930
Gosh.

693
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,370
My stun rod.

694
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,290
Says the guy who just told me that I need to practice more.

695
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,310
For sure.

696
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:40,790
Whatever.

697
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,930
Wait, does the ration also...

698
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,010
So for this game, for those who don't know, this game you have to like...

699
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,190
It's one of those types of games where you have an R&D department and you have to...

700
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,330
Make all your weapons and all your things like that.

701
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,090
So when I find stuff, I want to loot it even more.

702
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,330
So weird to hear this in Xbox controller.

703
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,470
They had to have recorded new voice lines for that.

704
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,050
I know, it's kind of interesting, right?

705
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,810
We get a new experience.

706
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,730
It's kind of fun.

707
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:17,390
Let's go.

708
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,170
Man, am I glad to be out of here.

709
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,510
Finally, we can leave all that crap in San Geronimo behind.

710
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,290
Geronimo!

711
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,610
Break into the mercenary business for real.

712
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,730
Let me guess.

713
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,810
You're doing it for her.

714
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:41,750
For Geronimo.

715
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,370
Our trauma.

716
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:47,930
Trauma flashback.

717
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,600
Do it for her.

718
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,880
Do it for her!

719
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:54,960
Do it for her.

720
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,580
Kaz looks so cute in her Little Nightmares cosplay.

721
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,200
Will someone please light this man cigar?

722
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,700
Someone please.

723
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,880
I love how much Kaz looks like a Ken doll in this game.

724
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,440
Yeah.

725
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,580
The peace management evolution.

726
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,300
And portable Ops Peace Rocker would be kind of cool.

727
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:33,500
Yeah!

728
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,940
They only got better at the system, which is cool to see.

729
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,780
La Silla!

730
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,660
Don't leave him in the rain.

731
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,930
Dang, Boss got smart.

732
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,170
He's always been smart.

733
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,190
But like him a way, you know?

734
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,390
Tree frogs or bridges?

735
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,810
That's just a code name the CIA made up.

736
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,710
We are not close like that.

737
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:14,690
Gosh.

738
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,990
Excuse you.

739
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,430
John Metal Gear.

740
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,080
Hot.

741
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,260
It's already...

742
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,180
Not the backyard!

743
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,380
Where will we go out to play?

744
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,380
Where will we put our swing set?

745
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,260
No!

746
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,120
What do we do with the grill?

747
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,860
No more barbecues.

748
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,860
Is America not already split into North and South?

749
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,880
Is that...

750
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,340
Oh my God.

751
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,820
The detail on Florida looks so funny.

752
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,320
Time to split it more.

753
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,820
Sorry for...sometimes the audio skips a little.

754
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,860
What?

755
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,620
Why?

756
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,480
I haven't noticed.

757
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,940
Maybe it's me.

758
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,260
Oh my God, I look like Big Boss right now.

759
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,640
I'm the one saying that.

760
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,030
Ooh.

761
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,050
Because she's cute.

762
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,610
I don't know.

763
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,990
Tape 69.

764
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,130
Uh oh.

765
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,670
Ah yeah, product placement.

766
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,470
This is the third time that Kaz has mentioned Japan.

767
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,250
I'll just let you guys know.

768
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,490
A pretzel?

769
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,570
Yes, the pretzel.

770
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,590
She's a horse girl.

771
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,010
What?

772
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,450
What?

773
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,170
What's it going to be?

774
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,470
Loyalty to your country or loyalty to me?

775
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,490
Your country or your mentor?

776
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,930
Your mission or your beliefs?

777
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,230
Ooh, my heart.

778
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,210
No spoilers everyone.

779
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,130
Oh my gosh.

780
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,930
My little finger.

781
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,430
No!

782
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,210
No!

783
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,710
Yeah, for Paz.

784
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,770
Do it for her.

785
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,290
Peace!

786
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,410
Look how cute she is.

787
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,690
She's so precious.

788
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,550
Yeah, we're doing it for her.

789
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,150
For Paz.

790
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,110
For peace.

791
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:56,770
For peace.

792
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,430
For peace.

793
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,010
November 10th, 1974.

794
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,010
Who the hell?

795
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,630
The blindest man ever.

796
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,290
Blind.

797
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,150
I'm right here.

798
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,570
Okay, time to finally get into it, huh?

799
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,150
Time to finally...

800
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,050
Take the long way around.

801
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,350
Whatever it takes to stay out of sight.

802
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,210
Your gun is a last resort.

803
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,890
I didn't realize that my gun was a CQC gun.

804
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,190
I didn't realize.

805
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,590
I didn't realize.

806
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,870
I didn't realize that I didn't have a CQC gun on me.

807
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,030
I didn't realize.

808
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,590
I didn't realize.

809
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,480
Look how fast it goes down.

810
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,340
They're like hey you're in the tutorial so don't worry about it.

811
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,620
This is HQ.

812
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,550
To press up against the wall, face it and hit the action button.

813
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:34,450
From that position, you can press LT to detect enemies.

814
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,570
That also works while lying down.

815
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,830
I forgot...

816
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,750
This is HQ.

817
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,550
This is patrol.

818
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:45,810
All clear!

819
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:46,950
Yep, all clear!

820
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,210
Stay vigilant.

821
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,990
The indicator in the upper right serves as a compass.

822
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,390
Everybody is talking.

823
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,090
I can't pay attention at all.

824
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:56,990
Everybody is talking.

825
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,210
Where was I going?

826
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,670
Oh my god, please guys.

827
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,590
I can't pay attention.

828
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,910
The more easily you'll be spotted.

829
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:13,410
Conspicuous movements and loud noises will compromise your camo index.

830
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,650
Your fatigues will act as camouflage.

831
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:16,970
Oh shoot.

832
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,750
Oh my god.

833
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,190
Holy...

834
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:20,870
Oops.

835
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,250
I don't remember how to zoom in.

836
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,530
But it's okay right now.

837
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:27,390
I think we're alright.

838
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,490
We're in the tutorial.

839
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,050
It's fine.

840
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,750
Give me a...

841
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:38,570
Bye!

842
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,210
There is no zoom?

843
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:45,770
Maybe.

844
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,630
Other weapons.

845
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,330
I can't zoom in yet.

846
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,570
Tutorial jitters.

847
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,830
I literally didn't notice that I was holding the big gun.

848
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,950
I was gonna go take him down.

849
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,630
I was!

850
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:01,950
I promise!

851
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,570
Oh my gosh, I forgot that this also has...

852
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:05,910
Oops.

853
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,890
This also has the...

854
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,790
What do you call it?

855
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,530
The... You...

856
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:15,990
You... You're...

857
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,310
Oh, I'm blocking... Hold on.

858
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,430
I'm blocking a lot of stuff.

859
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,350
So let me scoot over just a little bit.

860
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,510
I'll make myself smaller too.

861
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:23,930
The suppressor!

862
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,850
It'll... It'll break eventually.

863
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,390
The love box.

864
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,070
Not yet, unfortunately.

865
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,010
Not yet, unfortunately.

866
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,630
I'm not using...

867
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,930
Oh yeah, and we're also regaining health.

868
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,690
Gotta remember how this game works.

869
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,690
Gotta get used to it.

870
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,030
You think I can get that guy?

871
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,150
You think I can do the greatest shot of all time?

872
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,530
You think I can do it?

873
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:00,730
You think I can do it?

874
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,950
Oh, I got him.

875
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,920
I got him?

876
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,680
Nah.

877
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,160
I still got him.

878
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,500
I still got him though.

879
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,160
Looks like you're inside the compound.

880
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,460
Security is tight.

881
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,440
Stay sharp.

882
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,160
Just gonna...

883
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,740
Oh, that one was bad.

884
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,820
Uh-oh, my suppressor!

885
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:29,560
Uh-oh.

886
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,100
We're... We're donezo.

887
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,700
It's all over for us.

888
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,400
Time to sunrod.

889
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,600
Or, we could just explode everything.

890
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,000
Oh, hello.

891
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,100
Hello.

892
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,980
Oh my god, there's a guy over there too.

893
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,960
I'm remembering how to play the game.

894
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,120
Kind of.

895
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,200
I'm remembering.

896
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,940
The hello... sudden Kojima mention.

897
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,450
My suppressor.

898
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,970
This is why we do the ops at night.

899
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:13,810
I know, right?

900
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,470
What are we doing?

901
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,310
What are we thinking here?

902
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,150
I can't tell where the other guy is.

903
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,450
The guy that's supposed to be on... Oh, I see him now.

904
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,630
That's right.

905
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,110
Hold on.

906
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:37,170
We're good.

907
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:39,470
Don't worry about it.

908
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,320
I wish I could've...

909
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,680
I wish I could've taken him out for real though.

910
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,420
Yeah, beat that guy's butt.

911
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:00,030
Okay, this guy doesn't go any further.

912
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,040
I don't know how he heard me.

913
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,180
Hello.

914
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,200
Start talking?

915
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,160
You're looking for a two-story building to the east.

916
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:22,520
Okay.

917
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,940
Two-story building to the east.

918
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,040
Is this a two-story building?

919
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,060
Or...

920
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,800
I'm working on it, guys.

921
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,440
Gosh, he's so impatient.

922
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,540
Oh, I need the better equipment.

923
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,420
Yes sir, we broke him.

924
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,500
We acquired the whereabouts of target 500.

925
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,620
Acknowledged.

926
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,000
Spears are loaded.

927
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,100
The barge is clear to point Bravo.

928
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,200
Acknowledged.

929
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:00,800
Out.

930
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,800
Katsune Miku Oh, Archie!

931
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,200
Sorry.

932
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,560
Why...

933
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:16,200
I didn't notice at all.

934
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,160
Irizu

935
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,560
Oh I'm hungry.

936
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,340
I forgot there is... Archie!

937
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,660
What the heck is that?

938
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,680
Forgot about the QTEs.

939
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,520
He gets so into the cutscenes.

940
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,660
Shiny.

941
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,780
Actually, it would.

942
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,760
Actually, I recently got a...

943
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,860
A...

944
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,040
It's got a circuit that reverses the audio phase.

945
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,980
A comic book of MGS1 with art from Ashley Lynn.

946
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,960
I found it.

947
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,020
Found it.

948
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,960
Britney?

949
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,660
Oh baby, baby.

950
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,260
Oh.

951
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:07,540
Just kidding.

952
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,480
Yeah!

953
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,000
Not to the nukes.

954
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,000
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker!

955
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,760
Oh my gosh.

956
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,720
It's been so long since we heard this.

957
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,320
Wah!

958
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,520
Alert phases 1.

959
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,680
Don't worry about it.

960
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,040
Don't worry about it.

961
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,860
Obtained design specs for the following weapon.

962
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,240
Oh the M1C.

963
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,140
Rank 1.

964
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,020
Very cool.

965
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:13,820
Sandinistas.

966
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,280
If only I hadn't gotten that alert.

967
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,580
Or gotten an S rank maybe.

968
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,460
Nuke.

969
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,660
Japan Mansion!

970
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,060
Japan Mansion!

971
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,980
Don't do a Japan drinking game with me.

972
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,820
I think you'll die.

973
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,800
Are they planning a test?

974
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,660
Showing off?

975
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,880
Or is it all to keep the anti-American movement in check?

976
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:13,920
Good question.

977
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,560
Why bring them here?

978
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,340
I can't figure it out.

979
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,320
Whatever the CIA is up to in Costa Rica, the professor wants it stopped.

980
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,780
We need to find out what that something is.

981
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,200
We need to get ready for this task.

982
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,240
Repairs.

983
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,140
Working as fast as we can boss.

984
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,920
This place is pretty beat.

985
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,040
Looks like hell.

986
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,220
But as long as you're with us, we'll make it heaven.

987
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,060
No one can bother us here.

988
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,960
No state telling us what to do.

989
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,900
This is the MSF's haven.

990
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,420
Our mother base.

991
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,060
Mother base!

992
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,960
We'll back you up even better than before.

993
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,060
We're gonna turn this pile of junk into something big.

994
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,320
Our mother base baby!

995
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,020
There was a... I went to Enoshima in Japan, right?

996
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,940
Look how cute she is.

997
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,480
I went to Enoshima in Japan and...

998
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,540
There was a... It's a little island and... If you don't know what it is...

999
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,940
It's a little island and there's a shrine... A couple shrines there and stuff and it's just...

1000
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,880
It's like a really popular... Well, it's a really popular date spot.

1001
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,480
But it's also a really popular spot for like...

1002
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,600
For like school kids to go.

1003
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,060
For like trips and stuff.

1004
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:26,960
In Japan.

1005
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,240
And there's like a beach area.

1006
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,880
Obviously, because it's an island.

1007
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,260
But I was on the beach and there was like a boat way, way in the distance.

1008
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,960
And I was like...

1009
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,000
That's it!

1010
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,600
That's mother base!

1011
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,620
They're coming to pick me up!

1012
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,960
I'm going up!

1013
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:53,780
Totally my portable oil rig mother base boat.

1014
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,620
Yeah, Minto getting folded.

1015
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,060
Also, the tattoo!

1016
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,480
Contemplating what kind of tattoo you might want.

1017
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,000
Would you ever consider an Ashley Woods rendition of Snake?

1018
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:10,520
As cool as that would be, I think I would want something a little bit more subtle.

1019
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,020
Like, honestly, even like the peace...

1020
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:18,300
Like, I think it would be cheesy for anyone else that doesn't know Metal Gear.

1021
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,660
But like the peace symbol from this game.

1022
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,100
How it has like the plane.

1023
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,500
As like the little parts inside or something.

1024
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,300
Something a little bit more...

1025
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,620
That was kind of cheesy though, no?

1026
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,320
Maybe the peace symbol is a little cheesy.

1027
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:40,860
But...

1028
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,260
The logo is pretty clean.

1029
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,380
Anyone else would be like, oh wow, this girl is a hippie.

1030
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:52,260
But I've also thought about, of course, like the foxhound logo.

1031
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:53,680
Because...

1032
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,260
You know, like how Meryl has it.

1033
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,440
But I once made temporary tattoos of it.

1034
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,040
I don't know though.

1035
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,840
I would want something really subtle.

1036
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,060
So I could always look at it and be like, Metal Gear.

1037
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,540
But also, like, I don't want like a sleeve or anything.

1038
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:19,140
I feel like if I were to get Ashley Wood's art of Snake, it would have to be like humongous, no?

1039
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,540
For like all the small details to really...

1040
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,100
Get it all on my back.

1041
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,700
Get a full back...

1042
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,820
Full back tat of Snake's face.

1043
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,080
It would be like he's sneaking up on me.

1044
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,340
You can buy offshore oil rigs.

1045
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,100
They auction them off and they're not as expensive as you might think.

1046
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:43,840
I know!

1047
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,240
I've been told this before.

1048
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,100
And...

1049
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,100
You know...

1050
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,120
I wonder what the maintenance is like on that.

1051
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:53,960
How do you even...

1052
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,180
How do you even...

1053
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,040
Take care of it?

1054
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,400
Outer Heaven tattoo would go hard.

1055
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:01,900
Outer Heaven?

1056
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,880
Outer Heaven.

1057
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,120
The skull one with the snake in it?

1058
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,540
Or Outer Haven?

1059
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,000
Wait.

1060
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:10,600
Outer Heaven.

1061
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,100
Which...

1062
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:15,970
Outer...

1063
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:20,590
Heaven...

1064
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,770
Logo.

1065
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,650
Oh, that's the skull with the...

1066
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,050
With the wings, that's right.

1067
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,170
Outer Haven is the skull with the snake.

1068
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,310
Tattoo of an exclamation mark.

1069
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,270
Outer Haven is Sideview Skull.

1070
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:41,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:45,170
Welcome to MSF's Mother Base!

1073
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:49,950
Mother Base can support your mission in many different ways, from developing new weapons to collecting intelligence.

1074
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,380
Exclamation mark.

1075
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,400
Maybe...

1076
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,240
Somewhere.

1077
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,080
For me, placement is a really big thing too.

1078
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,390
Get a tattoo of Snake's back...

1079
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,720
With his arm around your neck so you can pretend he's holding you.

1080
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,020
He's so juicy.

1081
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:26,540
I'll have like... I'll get like a little knife on my neck so it's like he's holding the knife to my neck.

1082
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,810
And I'll be like...

1083
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,400
Start talking.

1084
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,540
Look at our people!

1085
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,780
Would you like to view the staff assignments?

1086
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,180
Yeah, it's been a while so we'll do that.

1087
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,220
Mother Base is divided into several...

1088
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,180
Actually, I think I remember pretty well.

1089
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,160
Yeah, nevermind.

1090
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,460
I remember.

1091
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:47,920
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

1092
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,080
This concludes the tutorial.

1093
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:50,960
Look at him!

1094
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,820
Wait, details.

1095
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,780
We're not mercenaries.

1096
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,420
We're not a foreign legion.

1097
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,960
MSF's a business.

1098
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,820
A new kind of business.

1099
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,020
Kazuhiro's all about that dollar-dollar bill, baby.

1100
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,640
This guy, he even was just like...

1101
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:16,720
Even when we started the mission, he was just like, Finally, we're not gonna be just a place where some guys chill.

1102
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,760
We're finally making some money, baby.

1103
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,640
Oh my gosh, I wonder what guys we have.

1104
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,240
We have Eagle Ray.

1105
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,100
I'm a slave to fashion.

1106
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,300
I collect T-shirts in my spare time.

1107
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:40,510
I love the names of the guys in here.

1108
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,290
They're so funny.

1109
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:44,070
Let's put our heads together and make Mother Brace grow.

1110
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,650
Alright, Cabbage White.

1111
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,310
Hikari.

1112
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:48,950
I'm no good with people.

1113
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,410
Please look after me.

1114
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,190
Ostrich.

1115
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,690
I got a buddy named Johnny!

1116
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:55,990
You know him?

1117
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:58,990
Frill Shark.

1118
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,770
I got a daughter back home.

1119
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,610
Haven't seen her in years.

1120
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,950
Bobcat.

1121
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,950
Nothing like pumping some iron.

1122
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:09,750
Alligator.

1123
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,670
It's an honor to serve under a hero like you.

1124
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:14,790
Lobster.

1125
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,250
My grandpa was a mechanic.

1126
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:21,210
I can take an air-cooled engine apart in five minutes flat.

1127
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:24,270
Bluegill.

1128
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,950
Take a look at these guys.

1129
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,850
I was the arm-wrestling champion of my hometown.

1130
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,030
Two years running.

1131
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,070
And runner-up the year before that.

1132
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:36,130
The champion before that!

1133
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:37,970
Okay, Bluegill.

1134
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,150
Your stat isn't that high.

1135
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:44,770
Magpie.

1136
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:50,070
You stay here too long, you start losing track of what day it is.

1137
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:51,590
Rhinoceros.

1138
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,410
My wife is always good to me.

1139
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,210
I guess that's what love is.

1140
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,950
Mun-ra-si...

1141
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,330
That's a death flag.

1142
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:12,390
I left some of my buddies behind on the last battlefield.

1143
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:15,770
You gonna give me the chance to make it up to them here?

1144
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:17,050
No!

1145
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,970
Your stats are doo-doo!

1146
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,670
I'm gonna send you overboard!

1147
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,510
Lungfish.

1148
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:25,430
I'm a weapons technician.

1149
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,350
It literally says you are a medic.

1150
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:28,370
Scissor.

1151
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,530
It says you are a medic.

1152
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,010
You say weapons kill people?

1153
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,250
I say they are needed to protect people.

1154
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,570
Koi-poo.

1155
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:41,950
I'm your man.

1156
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:43,950
Give me an order and it'll get done.

1157
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:48,530
As long as it's nothing to do with R&D because you have no skill.

1158
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,650
Bobcat doesn't know he's joined a mercenary group.

1159
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,210
Bobcat just thinks this is the best gym.

1160
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:59,550
I was about to be like, wow, who's this talented fella?

1161
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,230
Alright, let's see.

1162
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:03,950
We're gonna put you guys...

1163
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:09,250
I almost feel like auto-assigning.

1164
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,230
Wait, how do I do that?

1165
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:19,570
Put you in R&D.

1166
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:24,190
We gotta start making money!

1167
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,930
We gotta start making our GMP!

1168
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:28,850
Our...

1169
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:29,890
Good...

1170
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:30,990
Mental points.

1171
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,380
Auto-assign is pretty good in this.

1172
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,200
How do I do it again?

1173
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,520
Is it...

1174
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:41,700
No?

1175
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,240
In the jail.

1176
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,640
No...

1177
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,680
Master Miller's good.

1178
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,120
Go down?

1179
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,000
Oh, thank you!

1180
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:00,960
Auto-assign.

1181
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,480
Sniper rifle!

1182
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,400
Throwing weapons.

1183
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,520
Smoke grenade.

1184
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,740
We'll be able to make a full 10 soon.

1185
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:12,420
Versus.

1186
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,880
And then R&D.

1187
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,140
This is where we get our stuff.

1188
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,220
No, I think I'm okay.

1189
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,100
I think I remember.

1190
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,640
I think it's not so difficult.

1191
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,560
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

1192
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:21,960
We can...

1193
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,520
When we... It's like a tree, no?

1194
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,800
Oh, we do have money!

1195
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,500
I will be using this a lot.

1196
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,460
So...

1197
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,020
Let's start working on that.

1198
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,280
And...

1199
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,300
Sniper rifle.

1200
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,080
Start working on that.

1201
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,520
What's this?

1202
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,460
Smoke grenade.

1203
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,260
We'll start working on that.

1204
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,200
Okay.

1205
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,000
Cool, cool.

1206
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:57,860
And what items?

1207
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,140
We probably don't have anything.

1208
01:19:59,140 --> 01:19:59,660
Oh!

1209
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:00,920
Oh!

1210
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,460
Fulton!

1211
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:05,620
Analyzer?

1212
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,180
What is this?

1213
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,360
Love box!

1214
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
Everybody, this is the most important thing.

1215
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:16,000
If you get anything out of this game, remember the love box.

1216
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:20,730
What's this?

1217
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,690
Analyzer.

1218
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:25,350
Analyzer's information about enemies.

1219
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,170
Oh, that's right!

1220
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,770
We can see if they're worth stealing or not.

1221
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,490
But for right now, we need to steal everybody.

1222
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:35,090
So, actually, I'm not even gonna work on that because we're just gonna...

1223
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,810
We're gonna be taking everybody home.

1224
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:38,850
I love that.

1225
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:41,890
I love that we can make our place so big and nice.

1226
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:46,110
It's very strange not having all the stuff that I had from before.

1227
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:47,450
Oh, wait, sorry.

1228
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,070
Confidential document for...

1229
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,330
Oh, specs for R&D.

1230
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:52,810
That's right, the grenade and everything.

1231
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,470
Our fatigues.

1232
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,530
We can be naked.

1233
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:56,910
You know.

1234
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:01,990
Good for players who like raw, intense combat.

1235
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:08,470
I feel like someone's gonna screenshot me looking at likes raw.

1236
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,770
It's right next to my... Like raw.

1237
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,490
I like

1238
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,060
how you beat up people and they go, OMG, hi big boss.

1239
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:27,820
Oh, yeah.

1240
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,920
Well, unfortunately, in this game, you don't get to run around Mother Base.

1241
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:39,600
But they actually implement that for V, so that's fun.

1242
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,600
So, time to get a mission, baby.

1243
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:48,640
Ready?

1244
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:51,560
What?

1245
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,040
You'd rather keep wandering from conflict to...

1246
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,880
Select the mission that you wish to participate in.

1247
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,980
Are you guys ready for some of the missions that you have to do over and over and over again?

1248
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,540
Raw and intense in the love box.

1249
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,380
Got it, boss.

1250
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,180
Fulton recovery.

1251
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,600
MSF soldiers only.

1252
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,600
Snake has knocked out a radio soldier in the supply facility at Puerto del Alba.

1253
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,120
We got it.

1254
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,600
Also, this one...

1255
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,520
Will you play Death Stranding 2?

1256
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,640
I'd love to, yeah.

1257
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,980
I gotta finish Death Stranding 1, though.

1258
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,920
Mission prep.

1259
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:50,640
We gotta...

1260
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,560
Okay, we got our Fulton.

1261
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,420
We got our Zzz's.

1262
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,420
Can I... I don't wanna... Oh, that's right.

1263
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,640
We can only...

1264
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,940
Oh, it's not developed yet.

1265
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,120
We can't even use Snake.

1266
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,220
We gotta use someone else.

1267
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,040
Snake already did the heavy work.

1268
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,840
I think alligators are best, but...

1269
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,100
Oh yeah, alligator.

1270
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,220
For those wondering...

1271
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,420
I did see a comment.

1272
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,860
And it was only one comment in the pre-chat.

1273
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:30,220
So if you're here, this is not just addressed to you, but to everybody.

1274
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,020
Because some people might be wondering.

1275
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:38,100
Obviously, I want to play missions with people.

1276
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:38,760
Oh no.

1277
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:39,340
No, no, no.

1278
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,060
It's not a bad thing.

1279
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:46,920
Just the comment was someone saying, I hope that she plays some of the missions.

1280
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,560
Or she plays the missions by herself.

1281
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:56,620
Because they saw another VTuber who played this before in the past.

1282
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,480
And the last time that they did it, they played with people.

1283
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:06,240
But I distinctly remember seeing another VTuber that did that.

1284
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:11,440
That only did the boss fights with other people.

1285
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:17,640
And did most of the solo missions themselves.

1286
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,420
I'm just saying.

1287
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,540
But, I mean, I've already played this game.

1288
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:27,500
So I honestly would like to play with people as much as possible.

1289
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:35,500
So I don't think it would be bad to do most of the missions.

1290
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,420
With everybody.

1291
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,640
In fact, I think that would be way more fun to do co-op.

1292
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,660
And since I don't get so many chances to play with you guys.

1293
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:50,220
I always want to find ways that I can include you guys in streams.

1294
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:54,000
So for me, Peace Walker is extremely fun because of that.

1295
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,240
Yeah, that's kind of my thought process on it.

1296
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:09,960
Since the last time I did play it, I did the bosses with people.

1297
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,680
And most of the missions by myself.

1298
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,560
But I think for this, I would like to play more with people.

1299
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,360
Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

1300
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,240
So if you have an Xbox...

1301
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,240
Honestly, I feel like I should have done like a...

1302
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,380
I feel like I should have done like a poll.

1303
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,680
Which do you have?

1304
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,160
Xbox or PS3?

1305
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,960
Or Playstation rather.

1306
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,240
PC.

1307
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,680
This game is not on PC.

1308
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,700
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts!

1309
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,420
Thank you!

1310
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:59,540
Got mine ready boss.

1311
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:13,750
So...

1312
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,910
Waiting for you on my Xbox right now, Minto.

1313
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,860
If it comes... I think I mentioned it earlier.

1314
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,720
But I'll say it again just in case someone missed it.

1315
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:34,300
If it comes down to where more people have the PS3 version or PSP...

1316
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,100
I think PSP and PS3 can both play together, right?

1317
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,540
Since it's a Playstation network.

1318
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:45,900
If it comes down to more people having it on the Playstation side than the Xbox side...

1319
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,540
I will just...

1320
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:54,000
You know, we can play the Xbox today and maybe in the future I switch.

1321
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,540
And if not...

1322
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,220
You know, if we still have a lot of people playing.

1323
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,700
I can't... I say a lot.

1324
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:06,460
I don't expect to have like so many people because it is an older game.

1325
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,520
But you can still buy it if you do want to play.

1326
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,500
And it is a lot of fun.

1327
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,070
Console wars are back.

1328
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,350
Does online still even work on 360?

1329
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,090
I'm almost positive it does.

1330
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,750
It literally... Let's see.

1331
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,190
I don't... Well, OK.

1332
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,410
Let me do this mission real quick.

1333
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,430
And then we'll... OK.

1334
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:49,250
Alligator, it's your time to shine baby.

1335
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,270
Let me do this mission.

1336
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:54,170
We're gonna go get this guy and then we're gonna...

1337
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,490
We can test it out.

1338
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:58,330
Minto is underestimating herself again.

1339
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,930
I'm not!

1340
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:06,570
I'm just saying I don't know how many people still, you know, have what we are playing on.

1341
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:16,610
Get up next to them so the icon appears and push the action button.

1342
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,090
Where is he?

1343
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,710
No you didn't.

1344
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,430
Don't lie.

1345
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,470
Liars are ugly.

1346
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:36,150
Like a... See, he's even telling me to play the game with people.

1347
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,670
He's telling me.

1348
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,270
Oh my God.

1349
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,990
Wait.

1350
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:49,790
That guy is not coming here, is he?

1351
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:50,970
Who are you?

1352
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,290
He's walking into the wall.

1353
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:55,830
Wait, what is he doing?

1354
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,330
Oh yeah, that's right!

1355
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,510
OK, OK, OK!

1356
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:09,750
I'm working on it!

1357
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,370
I'm working on it!

1358
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,350
I'm working on it!

1359
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:11,890
Oh my gosh!

1360
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:12,990
I forgot that I can

1361
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,960
get...

1362
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,420
I forgot!

1363
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:19,800
I forgot!

1364
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,860
No you didn't.

1365
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,840
Here he goes!

1366
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,820
Where... Where is...

1367
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,220
Is he out yet?

1368
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,200
There he goes.

1369
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,460
And you!

1370
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,400
And where is the other guy that we knocked out?

1371
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:51,960
Hello!

1372
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,220
Oh here you are.

1373
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,000
Coming home with me!

1374
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,120
We're getting more people.

1375
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,080
And you!

1376
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,900
I know, that's the mission.

1377
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:17,740
Me too!

1378
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,420
I love stealing men!

1379
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,840
It's so fun!

1380
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,160
Alright, alright.

1381
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,820
No animals here.

1382
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,840
No animals.

1383
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:45,830
Show me...Oh!

1384
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,430
The following words can now be infused with heroic spirit.

1385
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,670
Oh my gosh!

1386
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:52,830
That's another thing you can do!

1387
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:53,310
Oh my gosh!

1388
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:56,050
For those who don't know this game yet, there is so much you can do!

1389
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,050
It's just too much fun!

1390
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:58,650
It's too much fun!

1391
01:30:58,710 --> 01:30:59,750
This game is so much fun!

1392
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,910
I love this game.

1393
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:02,450
Everything about it.

1394
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:09,650
We know who you are big boss.

1395
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:16,290
OK We got...Oh no, that's who we just were.

1396
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,010
Show us our men.

1397
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:22,010
Show us our new pals.

1398
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,850
We got chicken grunt!

1399
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:27,890
I'm a mountain boy.

1400
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:30,150
All this water and boats and stuff.

1401
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,490
Give me a mission, quick!

1402
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,470
We got oar fish.

1403
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:36,830
We got aardvark.

1404
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:39,130
LIZARD!

1405
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,900
We got a lizard!

1406
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,220
So what if you get knocked out?

1407
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,640
A few good smacks and you'll wake right up.

1408
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,020
LIZARD!

1409
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,080
He's so bad.

1410
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:08,800
Look at him.

1411
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,280
He's got like no stats.

1412
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,580
But chicken grunt is pretty good.

1413
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,040
Steal some from the enemy if you have to.

1414
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,420
Or call for resupply.

1415
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,040
Or search around the area.

1416
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,480
I was just napping on the floor like I normally do.

1417
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,680
When I woke up I was here.

1418
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,300
Are you my boss now?

1419
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,980
It's like a chicken hatching from the egg.

1420
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,200
Yes, imprint upon me.

1421
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,520
LIZARD!

1422
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,020
I can't believe we got a lizard!

1423
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,400
Nice

1424
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,800
I see some people mentioning leech.

1425
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,600
I once had a soldier named leech.

1426
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,620
That guy...

1427
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,160
He was not the best to ever do it.

1428
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,240
He actually sucked.

1429
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,380
But I'll never forget him.

1430
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,880
Lizard looks the same in each playthrough.

1431
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,920
So this isn't randomly generated?

1432
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,720
They actually crafted each and every one of them?

1433
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:20,860
Maybe.

1434
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,920
If that's the case it's huge.

1435
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,630
That guy sucks your blood.

1436
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:33,270
He was just a leech.

1437
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:35,010
He had no skills, no nothing.

1438
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:38,250
And then he died and it was so sad.

1439
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,250
You can see all the cutscenes.

1440
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,990
The menu is a little confusing at first.

1441
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:51,110
So basically you're gonna have the main ops as it says.

1442
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:54,710
And then there's extra ops which is what we just did.

1443
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:58,090
But like...

1444
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,830
Oh wait, how do I...

1445
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:04,190
How do I see the tapes?

1446
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,290
Hold on.

1447
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,590
How do I see the tapes?

1448
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,410
Give me a second.

1449
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,830
I heard I got recruited!

1450
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,530
Oh my god!

1451
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:17,070
Lizard!

1452
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,810
Lizard!

1453
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:21,270
Lizard!

1454
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,710
Oh it's in the mission briefings.

1455
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:23,350
Thank you.

1456
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,910
Thank you, thank you.

1457
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:30,150
Lizard and Jot.

1458
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:32,570
Is there one here?

1459
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:35,790
Skip, skip.

1460
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,010
Oh yeah, yeah.

1461
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:39,230
See?

1462
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,690
So you can ask people too.

1463
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:43,790
Let's see what Pies has to say about this.

1464
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,530
She's so cute.

1465
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:28,570
One thing I... I don't know why I can get behind the cassette tapes in this game.

1466
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:34,370
Because you don't really have codec in this game so much.

1467
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:38,870
Like in the traditional sense that it was in the last Metal Gear games.

1468
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:44,490
But I don't know why I can't get behind the cassette tapes in MGSV.

1469
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:45,590
It's just so...

1470
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,190
I don't know.

1471
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:53,850
I don't know.

1472
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,150
V had so many.

1473
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,410
There's a lot.

1474
01:35:56,990 --> 01:36:02,090
I think maybe because in this game, obviously, there's technical limitations because PSP.

1475
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:08,630
So I'm just like, oh, you know, they can't do a full cutscene all the time.

1476
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:11,810
But I don't know, like, it's so strange.

1477
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:16,850
Metal Gear sometimes becomes like an audiobook.

1478
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:25,370
Because you have that whole segment at the end of MGS2 where it's AI Colonel and AI Rose talking with Raiden.

1479
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:27,870
That whole segment is just talking.

1480
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:29,610
There's not a single cutscene.

1481
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:34,050
Like, it's just... it's... but it works.

1482
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:34,870
I don't understand.

1483
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:40,050
I don't... I don't... I don't understand how it works so well.

1484
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:44,650
I get so invested in it without, you know, the visuals.

1485
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:45,570
I don't get it.

1486
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,190
I love audio dramas.

1487
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:47,650
Yeah.

1488
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,830
It's so strange, right?

1489
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:54,210
It just works.

1490
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,530
It just works.

1491
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,070
I know.

1492
01:36:56,230 --> 01:36:57,110
It's so strange.

1493
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,050
I mean, there is cutscenes...

1494
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:03,050
Like, spliced in, obviously, but...

1495
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:07,410
Like, that whole... I just think of how that whole segment is just them talking.

1496
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:13,690
And how it... how I'm like, oh, I like this, but in MGSV, I don't like that.

1497
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:16,850
And I don't know why in my brain it's different.

1498
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:17,810
I can't under...

1499
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,630
It's basically the same thing.

1500
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:26,390
Tapes in V feel purely made to fill empty space without gameplay and a chore sometimes.

1501
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:26,750
Maybe.

1502
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,040
Gameplay also interrupts the tapes?

1503
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,180
That's one thing.

1504
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:40,220
I can't... I can't play the game and also listen to the tapes at the same time.

1505
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,200
I have to be... I have to have my full focus on one or the other.

1506
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,420
Like, I have to... I can't be running around in the desert while also listening.

1507
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,240
Because I'm... I'm like... I'm too scared of getting caught.

1508
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,360
Should we test it?

1509
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,520
Join Xbox Live Party.

1510
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:06,300
Oh.

1511
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:11,230
Maybe...

1512
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,130
Host search.

1513
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,290
Or do I search?

1514
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,210
I don't... I want to host.

1515
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:17,790
Hold on.

1516
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,910
Let's try.

1517
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:19,450
Hold on.

1518
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:38,310
Is the one who gave us this mission, right?

1519
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:40,630
I guess.

1520
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,390
I'll put her on.

1521
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,310
Snake.

1522
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:45,330
Paz, where are you?

1523
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,930
Ciudad Colón, a school.

1524
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,730
The teacher told me to stay here until things quiet down.

1525
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:52,450
Teacher?

1526
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,830
Oh, him.

1527
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:57,210
He's...

1528
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:59,230
Yeah, that's probably good advice.

1529
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,350
See, he has a radio in his room so we can talk anytime.

1530
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,790
Yes.

1531
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:21,390
Groovy.

1532
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:23,950
Groovy channel.

1533
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:35,890
He's so soft with her.

1534
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,670
Never felt what it's like.

1535
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:08,930
Never even been interested in it.

1536
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,250
Oh, shut up, Snake.

1537
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,190
Sorry.

1538
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,690
Listen, Paz, I think your idea is...

1539
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:16,590
He's in his trauma era, you guys.

1540
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:18,750
I hope they turn out to be right.

1541
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,030
Yeah, me too.

1542
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,130
Peace is in your name.

1543
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:25,610
Who better to help bring it back?

1544
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:26,850
Thanks, Snake.

1545
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:29,290
I will be here whenever you need me.

1546
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:30,650
See you later.

1547
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:32,270
She's too cute.

1548
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:34,590
Snake, use your radio to call people.

1549
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:35,650
But stay alert.

1550
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,990
You're in the middle of a mission and can't afford to let your guard down.

1551
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:39,910
Got it.

1552
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,170
Need to know more about Costa Rica?

1553
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:42,950
When is trauma era?

1554
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:45,090
Good to know.

1555
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:47,250
We'll follow their transport route.

1556
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,650
This should take us straight to their main base.

1557
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:50,050
Okay.

1558
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,650
From what I've seen, it looks like nukes.

1559
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:53,650
Agreed.

1560
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:58,370
The key thing now is to confirm whether those spears really are what we think they are.

1561
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:00,510
And if so, why they're here.

1562
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:02,310
Follow the transport route.

1563
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:03,570
Find the nukes.

1564
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:04,850
That's what I'm thinking.

1565
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:08,350
First we should make contact with the Sandinista Commandante.

1566
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:10,650
They can tell us more about what's up ahead.

1567
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:13,630
But it looks like their hideouts already come under attack.

1568
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:14,390
Oh no!

1569
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:16,290
We better hope they're still alive.

1570
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,770
Snake, infiltrate that cabin and secure the Sandinista's Commandante.

1571
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:26,490
Neutralize any guards by knocking them out, putting them to sleep or even using the Fulton recovery system.

1572
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:27,550
Yeah, I'm stealing everybody.

1573
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,070
You choose how to handle it, boss.

1574
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:30,750
They're all coming home with us!

1575
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,690
Okay, now it'll let us host it.

1576
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:37,550
It's so funny, like...

1577
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,690
Well, not funny.

1578
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:39,990
It's actually so tragic.

1579
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:42,390
How...

1580
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,950
Big Boss comes to be.

1581
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:45,710
He is...

1582
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:47,110
He is...

1583
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:49,030
Truly just...

1584
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:51,170
Just so manipulated by everybody.

1585
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:55,630
Compared to, like, Solid Snake.

1586
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,090
It's just so sad.

1587
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,850
Alright, I'm gonna try hosting it.

1588
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:04,430
Global.

1589
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:09,570
So yeah, you do need the Xbox Live.

1590
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:10,850
Everybody.

1591
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:15,450
It's just one person can make it in.

1592
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:16,350
We'll see if it works.

1593
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,110
As expected of an educator.

1594
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:22,770
How...

1595
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,630
As expected.

1596
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:31,870
As expected.

1597
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,430
Oh, wait!

1598
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1599
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:37,430
Sorry, I didn't do my mission prep.

1600
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:38,610
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1601
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,550
I didn't think about it.

1602
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:43,630
We gotta think of this too.

1603
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:46,090
So these are, like, the things we could say.

1604
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:47,630
Hold on.

1605
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:49,630
Hold on.

1606
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:53,950
I know I don't have so much unlocked yet, but...

1607
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:00,610
There's important ones in here.

1608
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,750
Like this one?

1609
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,760
My own snake sound bank.

1610
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,260
It's so dangerous.

1611
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,720
Okay, that should be good.

1612
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:36,540
Sorry, sorry.

1613
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,480
We're all good now.

1614
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,860
Okay, we're all good now.

1615
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,720
Starting the mission.

1616
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,380
So it does work!

1617
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:50,940
Yahoo!

1618
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,020
So exciting!

1619
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,740
Oh, I forgot to equip the version 2.

1620
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,180
It's okay.

1621
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,080
It's okay, we'll equip it next time.

1622
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,860
A country without an army.

1623
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,960
I'm not playing this on a 360, by the way.

1624
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,320
You don't have to have a 360.

1625
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:24,640
If you have, like, a...

1626
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,540
You can get it on any Xbox.

1627
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,240
Hmm...

1628
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:40,330
So...

1629
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,450
Oh my gosh!

1630
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:47,790
You're pretty good!

1631
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:49,310
Wait, how do I...

1632
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:50,870
We're syncing?

1633
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,590
Why are you...

1634
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,990
What is this?

1635
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:57,410
What's going on here?

1636
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:59,310
Why are we in sync?

1637
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:02,690
How do I...

1638
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:07,170
How do I...

1639
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:08,170
How do I...

1640
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:08,910
How do I...

1641
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:09,390
How do I do it again?

1642
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:10,230
I don't remember.

1643
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,710
Snake out!

1644
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,730
Wait, Takedo!

1645
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:17,610
How do I do it again?

1646
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:21,870
Go to the menu.

1647
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:23,770
And change your option.

1648
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:24,190
Wait.

1649
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:28,320
No.

1650
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,680
Do you wanna get in?

1651
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,400
Come on in!

1652
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,140
Come on in!

1653
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:49,970
Okay.

1654
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:51,530
That's enough.

1655
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:53,990
How do I...

1656
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:55,670
I can't remember how to do the talking menu.

1657
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:56,990
Oh my god!

1658
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:57,630
Hey!

1659
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:58,730
Stop following me!

1660
01:45:58,810 --> 01:45:59,470
This is weird!

1661
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,470
I can't remember.

1662
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:08,210
I'm trying to figure it out.

1663
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:08,810
Oh, communication!

1664
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:10,670
A...

1665
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,720
Okay, let's go!

1666
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:19,680
No!

1667
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,160
No box time.

1668
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:30,520
Takedo, you got in my shot.

1669
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,500
What are you doing?

1670
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,660
What are you doing right there?

1671
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,340
Oh my god!

1672
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,180
Takedo.

1673
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,740
It's either that or take out every last enemy soldier.

1674
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,540
You were supposed to help me.

1675
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,240
You were supposed to help!

1676
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,960
What just happened?

1677
01:46:59,320 --> 01:46:59,540
Huh?

1678
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:00,820
What just happened?

1679
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,480
Fulton recovery helicopter is complete.

1680
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:09,200
Fulton recovery subject confirmed on board helicopter.

1681
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:09,540
Cover.

1682
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:10,880
No!

1683
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:11,720
No!

1684
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,020
Not enough room, huh?

1685
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,540
We'll keep it here at the base.

1686
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,080
Alright.

1687
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:27,110
Onwards?

1688
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:28,270
Let's go.

1689
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:34,790
Peace Walker is one of my favorite Metal Gear games.

1690
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:36,310
I've been waiting for this stream.

1691
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:36,990
Hope you have lots of fun.

1692
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,590
Thanks Brandon!

1693
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:38,450
Me too!

1694
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:41,610
Okay, back to sneak.

1695
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:43,170
Back to sneaking.

1696
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:49,830
Where are you?

1697
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:50,470
There you are.

1698
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:52,890
I'm...

1699
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:54,850
I can't see anything.

1700
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:57,050
Stop you guys!

1701
01:47:59,110 --> 01:47:59,590
I'm...

1702
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:01,470
I'm playing a game!

1703
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:03,990
I wish I...

1704
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,190
Can you blow this up?

1705
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:05,910
That would be so cool.

1706
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:10,030
I'll have to turn it off later, I think.

1707
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:13,150
Okay.

1708
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:23,420
Wait, are we lost?

1709
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,860
Oh no, we're not lost.

1710
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,400
I know where we are.

1711
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,320
I got one guy.

1712
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,440
Oh, good job, good job.

1713
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,480
Oh, good job, good job.

1714
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:39,260
I did that one.

1715
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,120
I'm saying good job to myself.

1716
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:42,620
Oh shoot.

1717
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:45,580
Where did he go?

1718
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:46,960
Nope.

1719
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,700
He's gonna see them!

1720
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:51,120
Uh oh.

1721
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:51,840
Nothing?

1722
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:53,720
Oh, good job, good job, good job.

1723
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,860
Good job Minto, thanks.

1724
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:56,940
Thanks.

1725
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,300
Yeah!

1726
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:04,740
Oh, thanks.

1727
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:12,280
They're coming home.

1728
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:14,980
Yeah, grab all their things.

1729
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,780
Take everything that they're worth.

1730
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,560
Yeah, take everything that's...

1731
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,640
Roll over.

1732
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,240
Oh, nice.

1733
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,140
Oh, nice, nice.

1734
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,540
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1735
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:28,420
I'm taking them.

1736
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:31,500
D'oh.

1737
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,320
Is that everything?

1738
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:35,620
Okay.

1739
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,060
You ready?

1740
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,780
Go, go, go.

1741
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,120
I'll turn the notice off after this.

1742
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,240
Just ignore them for now.

1743
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,240
Just ignore them for now.

1744
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,260
Go, go, go.

1745
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:04,570
Corrupted.

1746
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:06,690
The boathouse should be close by.

1747
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:10,570
Neutralize the security detail and make contact with the Commandante.

1748
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:14,590
Good job Mii.

1749
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:16,810
Did you see that one?

1750
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:18,330
Did you see that?

1751
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:20,850
It's not over yet.

1752
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,830
Oh, sorry.

1753
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,410
You're right.

1754
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,110
Pay attention.

1755
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:25,230
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1756
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:27,030
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1757
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:29,630
Oh!

1758
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,590
How do you do?

1759
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:34,770
Oh shoot.

1760
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:36,930
What?

1761
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,970
I'm helping you!

1762
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:44,270
What are you talking about?

1763
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,730
Give me a hand.

1764
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,130
Give me a hand.

1765
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:48,990
Oh shoot.

1766
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:55,230
I got him.

1767
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:56,670
We're fine.

1768
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,190
Look at you hiding, you coward.

1769
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,290
Wait, there's a guy up there.

1770
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:03,330
Don't get too comfy.

1771
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,630
There's a guy up there.

1772
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:08,290
Well, he'll go to sleep in a second.

1773
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,400
Yeah, you're seeing things, bozo.

1774
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:16,860
Come home.

1775
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:24,030
Oh, good job.

1776
01:51:26,670 --> 01:51:27,750
Oh, my bad.

1777
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:28,910
Sorry, sorry.

1778
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:30,410
Sorry.

1779
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:32,250
You were doing that.

1780
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:36,230
Okay, you guys.

1781
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:40,190
You guys, it was silly at first, but please.

1782
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:41,010
I'm not...

1783
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:48,420
Please.

1784
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:52,820
Yeah, there he goes.

1785
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:54,900
I got his ass.

1786
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:55,900
I got his ass.

1787
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:00,840
Okay.

1788
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:05,800
Oh, I keep forgetting to take every... rob them of all their...

1789
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,540
Wait, what's happening?

1790
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:08,660
No!

1791
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:10,480
I was supposed to get one more man!

1792
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:22,980
Thanks, Chiquito!

1793
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,580
I took them all out.

1794
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,200
But I wanted to take him home.

1795
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,080
I wanted to take him home.

1796
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:48,410
Who is it?

1797
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:48,870
El Che?

1798
01:52:49,390 --> 01:52:49,890
No way!

1799
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,630
What do we do?

1800
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:52,630
Everyone gets a line.

1801
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,290
My old man!

1802
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,370
El Che?

1803
01:53:10,890 --> 01:53:11,370
Amanda?

1804
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:17,690
Ch...

1805
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,450
Don't wag that in her face like that!

1806
01:53:25,050 --> 01:53:25,910
Snake!

1807
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:28,650
Oh, my goodness!

1808
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:33,070
Gosh!

1809
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:41,850
Oh yeah, a photographer.

1810
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,130
I love birds!

1811
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:48,230
They're pretzels.

1812
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:54,450
Wow, she's so good at bluffing.

1813
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:59,590
The child craves the nicotine.

1814
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,630
Papa Noel.

1815
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:21,630
It's him!

1816
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:26,790
Howdy, Chico.

1817
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:30,470
This little waddle.

1818
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:47,710
They have a base near here.

1819
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:50,690
There's a factory to the north, across a suspension bridge.

1820
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:53,050
Factory to the north, across a bridge.

1821
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:57,890
Have you seen the big transport boat, mercenary crew, on the Rio del Jade?

1822
01:54:58,630 --> 01:55:00,290
You mean the barge?

1823
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:03,710
It's upstream from here, up toward Yasu.

1824
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:06,670
Any idea what's on it?

1825
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:12,370
I could introduce you to some of our compas up there, but I don't recommend going to the mountains.

1826
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,950
We've lost a lot of people there.

1827
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:16,350
They take us captive.

1828
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:18,950
Torture us for information about our compas.

1829
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:21,370
And then they kill us like pigs.

1830
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:25,230
This was our last hideout.

1831
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:27,650
The final refuge for el enfrente.

1832
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:32,910
After being pushed out of Nicaragua and into this vicious paradise of Costa Rica.

1833
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:35,930
Then, el monstruo attacked.

1834
01:55:36,890 --> 01:55:38,010
A monster.

1835
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:39,670
And my old man.

1836
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:48,900
My old man.

1837
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,320
Papa.

1838
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,080
You are the hope.

1839
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,580
Our hope.

1840
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,840
Now that Papa is gone, my sister is the commander of the revolution.

1841
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:57,380
Do not listen to him.

1842
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:01,320
Papa was a hero, who fought by Sandino's side.

1843
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,500
I am only his daughter.

1844
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:08,000
You need a special talent to become cacique.

1845
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:11,640
It takes someone great to unite all of las compas.

1846
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:16,960
Sorry to interrupt, but leaders don't choose themselves, neither do heroes.

1847
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:22,440
You carry on his legacy of la Esperanza and they'll follow you, no question.

1848
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,400
You think so?

1849
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,380
My compas trust me, but not one of them calls me comandante.

1850
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,240
Amanda!

1851
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,540
See what I mean?

1852
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:34,240
El Colibri!

1853
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,080
What should I make him?

1854
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:41,700
No!

1855
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:55,930
We

1856
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,300
got this!

1857
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:18,840
Is this Fortnite?

1858
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:28,690
OK, I got this.

1859
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:29,490
I got this guys.

1860
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:31,690
One shot.

1861
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:36,030
One shot.

1862
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:36,370
One shot.

1863
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:38,570
I think I got it.

1864
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,300
I got this.

1865
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:47,040
I got this.

1866
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:47,660
I got this.

1867
01:58:04,090 --> 01:58:05,910
It didn't even give me a chance.

1868
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,850
See, I didn't even do that.

1869
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:16,230
Chico!

1870
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:20,070
No, he won't survive the fall.

1871
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:21,530
Out of my way!

1872
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:23,910
Did you not hear what he said?

1873
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:28,090
Better for him to die at the hand of a compa than suffer their torture.

1874
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:33,390
What about our men then that we bolted?

1875
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:35,150
Stay here.

1876
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:37,890
As long as I'm still alive, I might as well retreat.

1877
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:41,410
Over here!

1878
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:43,910
Fine, Chico.

1879
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:45,190
¡Ventaremos!

1880
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:47,930
¡Ventaremos!

1881
01:58:54,900 --> 01:59:02,540
One day...Some annoying worker disappeared one day and then a week later you fall asleep on the job and you wake up and you've been kidnapped to work with that co-worker again.

1882
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:16,760
Sorry about that alert earlier.

1883
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,940
Xbox controls dip?

1884
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1885
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1886
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,660
Hatsune Miku!

1887
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:55,420
Good thinking.

1888
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:56,700
We can follow her.

1889
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:01,340
Head for the next outpost and make contact with Amanda if she's still alive.

1890
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:01,740
Roger.

1891
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:02,480
Roger.

1892
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:09,480
One of my favorite things about the Metal Gear games is how disproportionately...

1893
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:15,400
How the technology is so disproportionate across all the games.

1894
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:23,760
It's like, Peace Walker is in the 70s, yet we have this flying unmanned machine.

1895
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:29,240
I need a comic version of the Super Chat featuring Spongebob and Squidward.

1896
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:30,420
What?

1897
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:40,180
MGSV tech is insane.

1898
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:40,900
I know!

1899
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:42,040
It's so crazy!

1900
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,500
Yeah, we got a sniper.

1901
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,960
Oh, we got missiles.

1902
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:47,960
Yippee!

1903
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:49,880
Alligator.

1904
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:51,740
Lungfish.

1905
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:52,500
Good.

1906
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:57,560
People are...People are gaining...

1907
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:00,900
People are gaining...What's it called?

1908
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:02,900
Let's see, who do we got?

1909
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:04,480
Oh, wait.

1910
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,300
Duker?

1911
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,440
D-U-Y?

1912
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:17,400
I hardly even know her.

1913
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:20,820
How do you say his name?

1914
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:23,640
Dweeker?

1915
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,180
Moulin Rass...Didn't we get another one?

1916
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:35,540
My great-grandpa used to tell me, Sunny, bananas are good for more than just eating.

1917
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,760
What does that mean?

1918
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:49,020
What is great-grandpa telling you?

1919
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:55,020
It means diver in Dutch.

1920
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,800
Cool.

1921
02:01:58,780 --> 02:01:59,620
Great-grandpa.

1922
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:01,480
Mandrill.

1923
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:06,240
I know it takes more than weapons to make us strong and all, but at least give us some decent gear, alright?

1924
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,660
Okay, gosh.

1925
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,080
You also have to create the gear.

1926
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,340
Pause, is that you?

1927
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,520
Leech!

1928
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,480
I'll find my way back to you.

1929
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,040
I may not be as good as many things, but...

1930
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,220
Anyways, see you on MSM.

1931
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:29,820
Leech!

1932
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:37,490
Oh my gosh, seeing your ugly mug again is so great.

1933
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:42,030
I like the little descriptions for each person.

1934
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:45,650
Obviously, I'm not gonna read them every time for each person, but it's still so fun.

1935
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:46,690
Grouper?

1936
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:49,070
I hardly even know her.

1937
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:50,410
Mosquito.

1938
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,210
Costa Rica is full of swamps.

1939
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,730
Perfect for a mosquito.

1940
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:58,990
Make sure we got a good supply of dry socks.

1941
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:01,570
The last thing we need are fungal infections.

1942
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:09,310
Isn't that... Don't you get that from... Isn't...

1943
02:03:09,850 --> 02:03:10,870
Athlete's foot, right?

1944
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:17,410
One time, Moon Race's grandpa sat on a banana and of course that changed his life.

1945
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:22,570
I feel like I need to apologize for the follow.

1946
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:25,550
It's not that I'm uncomfortable.

1947
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,790
Don't worry about it, Casey.

1948
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:30,890
Thank you for...

1949
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:34,270
I appreciate the apology, of course, but don't feel like you...

1950
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:36,170
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.

1951
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:39,130
It was just the amount of notifications that kept popping up.

1952
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:40,350
Don't worry about it at all.

1953
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:44,310
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

1954
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:47,270
I'm not even a little upset.

1955
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:49,750
Jaguar!

1956
02:03:50,830 --> 02:03:52,550
Give me an order, boss.

1957
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:54,170
I can't say it.

1958
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:55,570
Jaguar.

1959
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,690
Jaguar.

1960
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:00,410
It's a jaguar.

1961
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:02,590
Jaguar.

1962
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:04,590
I can't say it.

1963
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:05,750
Jaguar.

1964
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:07,750
I can't say it.

1965
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:09,550
It's a jaguar.

1966
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:12,810
Jaguar.

1967
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:20,510
I can never seem to balance work and pleasure because whatever I'm working on turns into pleasure.

1968
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:25,530
MSF's got a real colorful crown now, don't we?

1969
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:32,730
I've become so attached to these stupid men.

1970
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:34,850
I just can't...

1971
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,590
I love them the most ever.

1972
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:38,590
Ready when you are, boss.

1973
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:39,690
Ah, kudu.

1974
02:04:42,770 --> 02:04:43,450
Okay, yeah.

1975
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:44,470
Yeah, yeah.

1976
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:45,250
Okay, that's all of them.

1977
02:04:46,670 --> 02:04:47,930
They're just so great.

1978
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:51,750
Auto-assign.

1979
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:52,130
Yeah!

1980
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:52,930
Rank 2!

1981
02:04:54,610 --> 02:04:55,910
Let's go to our R&D.

1982
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:57,630
Who wrote these?

1983
02:04:58,130 --> 02:04:58,570
Kojima.

1984
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:01,710
I have no idea, honestly.

1985
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,150
I wouldn't be surprised if it's him.

1986
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:05,330
It's all so silly.

1987
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:09,550
Gun.

1988
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:13,250
Handgun.

1989
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:15,670
This one is lethal, no?

1990
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,970
I've become so attached to these stupid men.

1991
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:21,830
It's just the story of you and MGS, huh?

1992
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,450
It's true!

1993
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:23,830
It is true.

1994
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,340
Pronouncing jaguar is easy.

1995
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:33,740
It's caramel.

1996
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:38,160
Do you guys say car-mel or car-mel?

1997
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,920
I can't.

1998
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:42,940
I don't like saying car-mel.

1999
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,480
Car-mel.

2000
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:47,800
Caramel.

2001
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,740
Car-mel.

2002
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,700
I've always said caramel.

2003
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:00,100
Caramel.

2004
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,560
That's when you're a real freak.

2005
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,320
Caramel.

2006
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:04,560
Car-mel.

2007
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:07,040
Where were we?

2008
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:07,740
Fulton.

2009
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,240
Throwing weapon.

2010
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,260
What is it under?

2011
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:16,200
Wait, I thought we could do the new... Can we not?

2012
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,420
I thought we could...

2013
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:24,280
I thought we had Fulton level 2.

2014
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:25,360
Do we not have to research that?

2015
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,480
Oh, it's under items.

2016
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:28,520
I'm such a silly goose.

2017
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:28,820
Sorry.

2018
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:28,900
Sorry.

2019
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,260
That's expensive.

2020
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,020
5000.

2021
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:40,700
I pronounce it car-mel most of the time but sometimes depending on the context I'll pronounce it car-mel.

2022
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:41,440
Oh yeah.

2023
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:42,660
That's fair.

2024
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:47,060
And then other... we'll get more stuff later.

2025
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:48,920
It's the wall.

2026
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,140
More missions baby.

2027
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:03,140
Go lethal at some point for variety?

2028
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:06,780
I just don't feel like... I don't know.

2029
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,940
I'm just so used to being non-lethal.

2030
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,080
But also we got to collect as many men as possible, no?

2031
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:15,160
Oh, do you guys mind?

2032
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:16,640
Actually I got to go to the bathroom real quick.

2033
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,060
Give me a second.

2034
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:21,000
I got to go to the little ghost's room.

2035
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,040
And I want to stretch too.

2036
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:27,860
Okay.

2037
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,900
Just a short, short break.

2038
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,540
Short, short break.

2039
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:37,640
Oh, what did I just do?

2040
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:39,400
I just hit my...

2041
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,940
There we go.

2042
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,120
Okay.

2043
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:49,440
Everybody, stretch.

2044
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:50,240
Get drink.

2045
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:50,960
I won't be so long.

2046
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,140
I might get some tea though.

2047
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,920
I might get a warm drink too.

2048
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:58,400
I don't know yet.

2049
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,120
Okay, I'll be happy.

2050
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:00,920
I'll be happy.

2051
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:54,260
Thank you for waiting.

2052
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,680
Thank you for waiting.

2053
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:00,920
I forgot... I also realized I forgot to turn off the notifications.

2054
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,520
Oh, hi.

2055
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,680
My cat is in there.

2056
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:06,300
Welcome back.

2057
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:07,540
No, don't scatter.

2058
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:08,280
Where are you going?

2059
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:09,460
Go back.

2060
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:10,860
Go back.

2061
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:12,960
You can't leave.

2062
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,660
I faulted you here.

2063
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,140
You're mine now.

2064
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:19,820
You're mine now, okay?

2065
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,120
Say yes.

2066
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:22,140
Yes, boss.

2067
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:30,140
Let me let my cat out.

2068
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:33,580
What are you doing, stinky girl?

2069
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:35,020
You're so cute.

2070
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:37,840
Oh, she just meowed.

2071
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:38,680
Okay, hold on.

2072
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,300
Let me let her out.

2073
02:13:58,650 --> 02:13:59,690
Alright.

2074
02:14:00,170 --> 02:14:02,390
Let me turn off the notifications.

2075
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:05,210
Oh, sorry.

2076
02:14:05,890 --> 02:14:07,070
Give me a second.

2077
02:14:11,650 --> 02:14:12,690
Settings.

2078
02:14:14,170 --> 02:14:15,010
Settings.

2079
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:20,790
Where is it again?

2080
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,850
Preferences.

2081
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:24,310
Notifications.

2082
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:26,950
Off.

2083
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:28,950
Off.

2084
02:14:29,150 --> 02:14:30,110
Allow notifications.

2085
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:30,590
Off.

2086
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:31,770
Off.

2087
02:14:34,690 --> 02:14:37,090
Oh, okay.

2088
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:43,140
We're back.

2089
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:44,660
Off.

2090
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:46,420
Oof.

2091
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:47,840
Oof.

2092
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:49,820
Yay!

2093
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:49,900
Yay!

2094
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:58,260
I'm glad Paws is around for her namesake's game.

2095
02:14:58,380 --> 02:14:58,980
I know!

2096
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:01,540
Right?

2097
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:03,380
So perfect.

2098
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:06,520
Except I joke a lot.

2099
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:08,840
This is a...

2100
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,540
This is not a spoiler.

2101
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:14,080
It's a thing that happens later on in the game.

2102
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:17,220
But I think without context, it's fine.

2103
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:19,220
But when she gets really...

2104
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,020
She likes to fight Butaro a lot.

2105
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,360
They are always fighting.

2106
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,960
This morning I was trying to sleep.

2107
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,160
And they were fighting on top of me.

2108
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:30,880
Like, she likes to sleep a lot in between my legs.

2109
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:35,380
And Butaro walks up to her and just starts fighting her for some reason.

2110
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:39,180
And so it was all on top of me.

2111
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:41,280
They were fighting.

2112
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:42,720
Who starts the fight?

2113
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,200
Either one of them.

2114
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:46,300
They are always just playing around.

2115
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:51,420
And she is kind of crazy.

2116
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,320
She is still very much like a kitten.

2117
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:56,220
And so she is always running around and destroying things.

2118
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:58,320
And so I'm always just like...

2119
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,640
Paws says peace day never came.

2120
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,840
So, we are going to pursue Amanda.

2121
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:13,280
Track and locate Amanda the Sandinista leader and obtain intel on the enemy's bases and the route to use to transport the nuclear material.

2122
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:27,240
And I will once again post.

2123
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:27,900
Because why not?

2124
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:28,480
It's more fun.

2125
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:30,340
Create.

2126
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,220
Okay, let's see.

2127
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:35,380
Fast!

2128
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:38,420
Harris...

2129
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:40,060
Harris...

2130
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:41,600
Harry the AI?

2131
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:42,380
Is that what it says?

2132
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,340
Thank you!

2133
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:44,020
Welcome!

2134
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:47,020
Cool, cool, cool.

2135
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,400
Alright, mission prep.

2136
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:54,840
And I do want to say too, you don't have to be good at this game or anything to play.

2137
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:55,420
It's all good.

2138
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:57,700
It's all good, baby.

2139
02:17:11,490 --> 02:17:14,970
I know exactly what has been equipped.

2140
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,730
Let's hear what Pies says real quick.

2141
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,990
Oh yeah, there's so many things.

2142
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:22,490
Oh gosh.

2143
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:27,150
We'll listen to them later.

2144
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:29,110
Here, let's see what he says.

2145
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:34,770
To get to your next objective, you'll need to backtrack along the way you came for a bit.

2146
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:38,070
Don't get too comfortable just because you know the terrain.

2147
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:40,030
The enemy knows you're out there now.

2148
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:42,390
They'll be out in greater force than before.

2149
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:44,270
Proceed with caution.

2150
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:47,950
Refrain from using firearms unless absolutely necessary.

2151
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:51,450
Looks like I'll have to cross the river.

2152
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:54,730
Yeah, there's a suspension bridge you can use.

2153
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:56,310
It's the only way across.

2154
02:17:56,830 --> 02:17:59,410
You'll have to be a little creative to keep from being spotted.

2155
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:04,390
So, I cross the bridge, go through the swamp, and come to a banana plantation.

2156
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:06,970
Complete with it's own factory by the looks of it.

2157
02:18:07,430 --> 02:18:11,030
It's going to feel a lot different moving through that area compared to the forest.

2158
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:12,410
Stay on your toes.

2159
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:17,210
Also, you may encounter Sandinista prisoners along the way.

2160
02:18:17,810 --> 02:18:20,630
Try and save as many as you can with Fulton Recovery.

2161
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:22,170
I'll keep an eye out.

2162
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:27,550
Alright, sorry to keep you waiting, Harry.

2163
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:27,690
Harry.

2164
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:30,530
Alright, let's start.

2165
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:35,610
Keep that one guy away.

2166
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:36,410
That's what I was thinking.

2167
02:18:37,030 --> 02:18:37,870
What was his name?

2168
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:38,810
I can't remember.

2169
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:43,530
With his great grandpa, he learned...

2170
02:18:43,530 --> 02:18:46,610
He's a descendant of the banana man.

2171
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:52,960
Starting.

2172
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:56,820
Oh gosh, the server is chugging along.

2173
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:58,300
It's cause you're a brat, Ash.

2174
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,420
I have to go.

2175
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:02,140
Thanks Brandon.

2176
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:03,260
Thanks for coming by.

2177
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:05,660
Listen up.

2178
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:07,520
For us, there is no victory.

2179
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:11,940
The models in this game look so good.

2180
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:14,440
Everybody is so good in this game.

2181
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:16,600
Oh no!

2182
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:35,010
Why are we sinking?

2183
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:39,250
What does that mean?

2184
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:40,430
What does that mean?

2185
02:19:40,710 --> 02:19:42,310
What does snake formation mean?

2186
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:54,090
Oh my god, you're scaring me.

2187
02:19:54,390 --> 02:19:55,230
Are you gonna do anything?

2188
02:19:59,890 --> 02:20:01,230
Maybe I can get this guy.

2189
02:20:07,090 --> 02:20:07,810
Good job!

2190
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:08,210
Wait.

2191
02:20:09,430 --> 02:20:10,030
No, no!

2192
02:20:10,830 --> 02:20:11,530
I got him.

2193
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:16,750
Wait, I want to Fulton these guys.

2194
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:17,810
I'm taking them home with me.

2195
02:20:18,730 --> 02:20:20,810
Oh shoot, I forgot to...

2196
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:28,150
Yeah, take them home.

2197
02:20:28,310 --> 02:20:28,830
Take them home.

2198
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:39,210
Through the roof!

2199
02:20:44,350 --> 02:20:46,870
This is so evil.

2200
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:50,050
Do you have to crouch like that?

2201
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,730
Do you have to...

2202
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:55,910
Do you have to crouch...

2203
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:02,170
It's too horrible.

2204
02:21:06,130 --> 02:21:07,670
Ok, let's keep going.

2205
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:08,610
Wait.

2206
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:10,690
We came from this way.

2207
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:10,770
No!

2208
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:21,250
Impressive!

2209
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:28,930
Wait.

2210
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:29,550
Wrong thing.

2211
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:30,290
There we go.

2212
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:30,550
Wait.

2213
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:32,090
There we go.

2214
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:37,010
Wait, hold on!

2215
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:38,070
Is there anything in here?

2216
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:40,470
Don't leave!

2217
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:42,710
Ok, there's nothing in there.

2218
02:21:43,310 --> 02:21:43,890
False alarm.

2219
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:46,190
I'm coming.

2220
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,970
I thought he yelled banana.

2221
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:57,350
No!

2222
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,220
Look at us, running...

2223
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:09,300
Wait, yeah, wait.

2224
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:12,080
No...

2225
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,540
Oh, good job.

2226
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:18,700
Why didn't I get him?

2227
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:21,240
What the hell?

2228
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,220
What?

2229
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:23,940
What a waste.

2230
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,200
Uh oh, we're stuck in a loop.

2231
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:27,860
Uh oh.

2232
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:28,540
No!

2233
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:29,900
I got him.

2234
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:31,000
I got him.

2235
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:31,380
I got him.

2236
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:31,820
You're ok.

2237
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:32,680
You're safe with me.

2238
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,540
Stick with Minto.

2239
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:35,660
You're safe.

2240
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:37,820
Hey, tell me I did a good job, you know?

2241
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:41,220
I just saved your ass.

2242
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:54,840
Is it this way?

2243
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,540
I can't remember.

2244
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:57,980
Where are we going?

2245
02:22:58,400 --> 02:22:59,520
This is where we came from before.

2246
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:02,760
No, not this way.

2247
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:03,280
Other way.

2248
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:07,120
Why is he naked?

2249
02:23:07,460 --> 02:23:08,900
He's going to the beach!

2250
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:12,500
I'm ready.

2251
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,340
Spread out.

2252
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:22,140
Where's the girl?

2253
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:23,340
Oh yeah, we got her.

2254
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:28,060
Oops.

2255
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:28,740
My bad.

2256
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:29,920
I got him.

2257
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:30,480
Don't worry.

2258
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:34,890
Amanda.

2259
02:23:42,470 --> 02:23:43,470
Is it this way?

2260
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:45,830
Wait, hold on.

2261
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:46,650
Can we high five?

2262
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,410
Come here.

2263
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:48,770
Come here!

2264
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:51,790
No.

2265
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,290
Nevermind.

2266
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,280
Ah, shoot.

2267
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:01,580
I think I had it first.

2268
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:03,240
There we go.

2269
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:05,440
Wait!

2270
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:08,100
High five.

2271
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,660
What is this?

2272
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:12,580
This is so intimate.

2273
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:13,500
Oh, we're sinking.

2274
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,720
I don't know.

2275
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:26,980
He's mine!

2276
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:28,420
No!

2277
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:30,080
He's mine!

2278
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:33,580
I like the spulton that drops all their items.

2279
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:34,380
It's kind of nice.

2280
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:36,200
It's pretty nice.

2281
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:36,860
I'm not going to lie.

2282
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:42,840
Whee!

2283
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,060
Spin to win.

2284
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:47,800
Hehe.

2285
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:49,120
Spooked ya, huh?

2286
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:52,900
Yeah!

2287
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:03,040
Is the wormhole spulton in this?

2288
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:03,300
No!

2289
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,060
This one, actually, you can just do however you need to.

2290
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:09,000
Like, you can spulton them indoors.

2291
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:14,020
Oops.

2292
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:15,080
My bad.

2293
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:15,980
Hold on.

2294
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:16,420
My bad.

2295
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,600
I got him.

2296
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:19,680
Don't waste.

2297
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:21,940
I got him.

2298
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:24,440
I'm taking him home.

2299
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:28,140
Notes.

2300
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,940
I can't see anything.

2301
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:31,980
Oh my god, game, please.

2302
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:32,780
Game.

2303
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:37,880
Take him home.

2304
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:41,480
Country roads...

2305
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:44,240
To the plains...

2306
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,400
Where?

2307
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:54,640
Harry!

2308
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:57,580
Apologize.

2309
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:00,060
That's your second offense.

2310
02:26:01,220 --> 02:26:02,960
That's your second offense.

2311
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:06,840
Yeah, Dogeza.

2312
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:09,560
Down on the ground.

2313
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:10,540
Down on the ground.

2314
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:19,210
Okay.

2315
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:20,570
Let's go.

2316
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:23,670
Oh my god.

2317
02:26:23,970 --> 02:26:24,630
Kaiser Hero.

2318
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:25,390
Metal tank.

2319
02:26:25,530 --> 02:26:26,330
Two people.

2320
02:26:27,170 --> 02:26:27,930
Drop it, Kevin.

2321
02:26:28,230 --> 02:26:30,290
This is why I love playing with you guys.

2322
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:31,010
It's so fun.

2323
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,630
Why is he naked?

2324
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:36,670
Why wouldn't you be?

2325
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:38,650
It's just a fun day at the beach, no?

2326
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:44,650
Oops.

2327
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,850
He's asleep.

2328
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:59,620
Oh, there's so many guys here.

2329
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:03,380
Good luck with that.

2330
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,560
I remember this place.

2331
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:08,140
Oh my gosh, I remember this place.

2332
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:09,180
Crazy.

2333
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:12,180
I remember this place.

2334
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,660
Can I get him through the fence?

2335
02:27:19,770 --> 02:27:21,690
I'm taking him down one by one.

2336
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:25,250
Oh my god, gamer.

2337
02:27:26,070 --> 02:27:26,910
Holy shit.

2338
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,460
Nice aim, boss.

2339
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:32,000
Thank you.

2340
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:34,240
Oops.

2341
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:36,060
I said...

2342
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:37,860
Oops.

2343
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:39,540
You don't see me.

2344
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:41,980
We're all good.

2345
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:43,180
It's clear.

2346
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:45,240
It's clear.

2347
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:47,120
Steal them all.

2348
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:47,660
Steal them all.

2349
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:48,660
Take them home.

2350
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:49,760
Take them home.

2351
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:52,520
Take them home.

2352
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:54,260
Wait, how many Fultons do I have left?

2353
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:55,260
Four.

2354
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:59,280
Someone might have to die.

2355
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:00,680
Is there somebody in here?

2356
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:11,660
The butterfly.

2357
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:11,940
Butterfly.

2358
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:17,840
I should take this guy.

2359
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:18,200
Is he good?

2360
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:20,120
I'm trusting you.

2361
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,260
I only have one Fulton left.

2362
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:28,140
But there's two guys.

2363
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:28,780
No!

2364
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,360
I'm not stealing too many men.

2365
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:33,660
This is how you play the game, baby.

2366
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:46,020
In V, when you Fulton people, they do start to hear it.

2367
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:49,160
This game is very chill with it.

2368
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,020
You can just Fulton anybody and it's all good.

2369
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,300
What do I do with him?

2370
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:06,240
Kill him with the banana.

2371
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,720
What do I do with him?

2372
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:20,440
Supper party.

2373
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:25,080
Stay back, Harry.

2374
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,890
OK, let's go.

2375
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:46,810
I was gonna say, I hope there...Oh good, we got another fatigue.

2376
02:29:47,710 --> 02:29:49,850
I was gonna say, I sure hope there's no more...

2377
02:29:52,090 --> 02:29:57,610
I sure hope there's no more...prisoners.

2378
02:30:07,010 --> 02:30:08,570
For us, there is no victory.

2379
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:10,450
Oh my god, I can't.

2380
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:21,810
Any mission with the tanks are just like so...

2381
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:23,430
You know?

2382
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:27,570
They are just so...

2383
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:30,470
Looks like

2384
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:35,850
there's no way around it.

2385
02:30:36,270 --> 02:30:37,150
You up for this, Snake?

2386
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:41,490
Laugh time, jerk.

2387
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:47,770
In the next episode of Dragon Ball Z.

2388
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:56,190
They are so 4 player co-op time.

2389
02:30:56,310 --> 02:30:57,090
Oh yeah, baby!

2390
02:31:08,490 --> 02:31:09,450
A kill.

2391
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:13,510
Wait, we only had one alert phase.

2392
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:17,530
415!

2393
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:26,550
The mech battles are gonna get so murdered.

2394
02:31:26,650 --> 02:31:27,330
It's fine.

2395
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:29,890
On a C for cool.

2396
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:31,890
He has a dream.

2397
02:31:33,790 --> 02:31:36,490
What does that mean?

2398
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:46,750
The Japanese!

2399
02:31:49,690 --> 02:31:50,650
The Japanese!

2400
02:31:57,850 --> 02:31:59,650
Speaking of food, I'm getting a little hungry.

2401
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:01,910
I'm gonna snack on some Goldfish.

2402
02:32:09,610 --> 02:32:10,390
Kaiz is what?

2403
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:11,110
Half Japanese?

2404
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:13,450
He's very proud of that half.

2405
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:17,370
He's extremely proud of it.

2406
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:30,630
Kaiz or Paz?

2407
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:32,670
Kaiz, Kaiz, Kaiz with a K.

2408
02:32:36,670 --> 02:32:37,370
Oh no!

2409
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:44,420
Well, we got plenty of new men, so...

2410
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,220
Do I need the mess hall team tutorial?

2411
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:51,380
I guess I'll look at it.

2412
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:56,120
Supply sufficient provisions according to the size of your mother base staff.

2413
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:58,360
Your current food supply is represented by food.

2414
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:05,860
Morale will rise enabling soldiers to perform beyond their natural abilities.

2415
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:08,960
Who would have thought they need to eat?

2416
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:13,260
Boss, we're starving.

2417
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:22,000
You can set quick comms message to back select buttons by hitting pause during a mission and going to the gear tab.

2418
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:23,180
Thank you!

2419
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:30,640
If morale falls too low, soldiers will defect and ultimately leave mother base.

2420
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,240
Adequate staff to the mess hall team.

2421
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,800
Thank you!

2422
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:43,220
Alright, we got our first POW!

2423
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:48,900
And you are chameleon.

2424
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:50,800
Let's use our heads on this one.

2425
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:54,680
Oh, actually his R&D is great.

2426
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:55,800
Cockatoo!

2427
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:00,640
Hey Miller, imagine snake having a kid.

2428
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:02,240
What race should be the mother?

2429
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:17,220
Blood from the east flows through your veins.

2430
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:23,380
We got moth.

2431
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:27,120
Flying weapons are usually pretty noisy.

2432
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:30,200
They ought to be easy to find if you got a surround indicator.

2433
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:32,080
Right boss?

2434
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:33,760
GoldenEye.

2435
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:37,140
GoldenEye is straight to the point.

2436
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:38,980
I like you.

2437
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,100
I like you.

2438
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:43,440
Marine Iguana.

2439
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,700
I may not look it, but I'm turning 48 this year.

2440
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:51,000
Drop the skin routine.

2441
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:52,520
Let's drop the skin care.

2442
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:53,560
Numfish?

2443
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:55,880
Cardinal?

2444
02:34:57,820 --> 02:34:58,400
Starfish?

2445
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:02,660
Boss, the R&D team is screwing around.

2446
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,340
They are playing with cardboard boxes.

2447
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:05,920
What the hell is that?

2448
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:09,040
Crab.

2449
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:11,560
Moonrassy.

2450
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:12,980
Ostrichman.

2451
02:35:13,100 --> 02:35:13,320
Wait.

2452
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:15,580
Raccoon.

2453
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:17,300
Sometimes I get to thinking.

2454
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:20,780
What is human life in the face of truly great scientific research?

2455
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:23,120
Alpaca.

2456
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:24,260
Wolf.

2457
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:28,140
Just between you and me, I'm the guy who keeps MSF together.

2458
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:29,920
You just got here!

2459
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:34,700
Okay Wolf.

2460
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:36,740
Jeez.

2461
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:37,860
Honeybee!

2462
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:39,080
Oh my gosh!

2463
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:39,580
Honeybee.

2464
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:43,540
Sniper rifles are best for precision long range shots.

2465
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:44,960
Chameleon.

2466
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:46,340
Okay, I think that's everybody.

2467
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:47,620
Nice!

2468
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:49,780
Auto-assign.

2469
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,420
Okay.

2470
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:51,620
Wow!

2471
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:52,820
Our food is crazy.

2472
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:57,580
I have a question.

2473
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:01,900
Does auto-assign also...

2474
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:04,420
work for the people that are already assigned?

2475
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:06,240
You know?

2476
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,680
Wolf is me and every job or project is started.

2477
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:13,260
Or does it only auto-assign people in the waiting room?

2478
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,480
Only for new recruits.

2479
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:28,580
Bionic Hippo!

2480
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:29,820
Thank you so much for the 10k!

2481
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:30,740
Thank you!

2482
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:37,020
It would just be so many people I'd have to move back and resort, you know?

2483
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:40,780
Anyway, thank you!

2484
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:43,640
Kaz's head is the Ken doll, yet he's half Japanese.

2485
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:46,360
The Japanese half must be his lower half?

2486
02:37:00,770 --> 02:37:01,950
Go to all and auto-assign.

2487
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:05,530
Oh, there is no auto-assign.

2488
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,110
Sad.

2489
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:08,790
So sad!

2490
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:16,700
Japanese feet.

2491
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:20,980
You would like that, wouldn't you?

2492
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:24,900
Is there anything that we should be making?

2493
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:28,480
There we go.

2494
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:29,680
What's the M10?

2495
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:32,180
Oh.

2496
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:34,240
It's a machine gun.

2497
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:37,340
Our good-o kit for now.

2498
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:40,740
The analyzer.

2499
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:43,220
I guess I'll grab this now.

2500
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:48,740
OK.

2501
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:51,800
Back to mission.

2502
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:55,940
Yippee!

2503
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:59,260
Yippee, yippee!

2504
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:01,520
OK.

2505
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:05,480
Everybody ready to join for...

2506
02:38:06,900 --> 02:38:08,280
Let's see.

2507
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:11,180
I'm gonna need the big boys.

2508
02:38:11,180 --> 02:38:11,380
What's that?

2509
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:36,640
Briefing first.

2510
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:37,440
We can brief.

2511
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:40,540
Help me Miller.

2512
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:53,600
Nah, they're babies.

2513
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:55,820
They're sinking.

2514
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:00,480
Yeah.

2515
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:03,840
We'll see how you feel when you actually have to face them in battle.

2516
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:07,400
Snake, whatever you do, don't let them surround you.

2517
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:10,880
The last thing you need is to get pushed into the vehicle's kill zone.

2518
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:14,040
And pay attention to what your enemies say to each other.

2519
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:20,160
You can improve your chances by figuring out what they're planning and using it to preempt their movements.

2520
02:39:20,820 --> 02:39:23,200
You don't always have to go toe-to-toe to win a fight.

2521
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:25,280
Think like a gorilla.

2522
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:26,520
Got it.

2523
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:37,020
I'm thinking...

2524
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:39,380
Hello!

2525
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:41,100
Flying Taco!

2526
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:45,600
Dull Bracelet!

2527
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,380
And...Burg Boy!

2528
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:50,900
What are these names?

2529
02:39:52,300 --> 02:39:53,220
Okay.

2530
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:55,700
We don't need this guy.

2531
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,320
We need the big boys.

2532
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:01,820
We need the law.

2533
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:05,220
And the grenades.

2534
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,180
Tuxedo!

2535
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:12,030
Tuxedo.

2536
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:13,070
I'm excited.

2537
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,260
Let's rock.

2538
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:25,300
Do I need to change my fatigues?

2539
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:26,260
You know what...

2540
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:34,940
Water.

2541
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,420
Naked Pink!

2542
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:44,640
Let's rock.

2543
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:51,220
Oh, I have to re-equip all my stuff.

2544
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:53,100
Oh my gosh, I forgot that this is how that game works.

2545
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:56,420
Oh my goodness, you...

2546
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:00,220
Grenade.

2547
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,820
And even I'll bring the smoke grenade too.

2548
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:04,840
Anything else?

2549
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:06,900
Empty mag.

2550
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:08,800
We don't need to distract them right now.

2551
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:11,420
Then a

2552
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,900
love box always.

2553
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:34,500
Camera so I can take pictures of everybody.

2554
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:35,780
Alright, let's go!

2555
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:38,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

2556
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:40,900
Let's go team!

2557
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:42,220
Let's go team!

2558
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:51,040
Ripped Snake.

2559
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,300
Are we all naked?

2560
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,900
That would be so funny.

2561
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:57,500
It would be so crazy.

2562
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:03,660
Gorilla time!

2563
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:09,220
I'm thinking like a gorilla.

2564
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,740
That's why I took off my clothes.

2565
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:16,300
The models in this game are so awesome.

2566
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:17,360
I can't get over them.

2567
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,420
And then I see them everyday because I own the... What's it called?

2568
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:23,520
The Mountain Ducans.

2569
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:30,340
I own the Mountain Ducans so I see everybody's pretty faces, all these pretty models everyday.

2570
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,640
Silly gang.

2571
02:42:49,940 --> 02:42:51,400
Yeah, why are we all naked?

2572
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,240
What happened?

2573
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:56,700
Team, what happened?

2574
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:00,400
Say cheese!

2575
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:04,800
How do I use this?

2576
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:05,960
Press RT.

2577
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:07,800
Snake, come here!

2578
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:08,120
Come here!

2579
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:08,460
Come here!

2580
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:09,240
Come here!

2581
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:09,960
Come here!

2582
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:11,760
Everybody get in frame.

2583
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:16,840
Say cheese!

2584
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,120
Say cheese!

2585
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:22,360
Good, good, good.

2586
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:23,700
Thank you!

2587
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:28,580
What are we doing now?

2588
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:29,980
I got the law.

2589
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:32,200
Are we taking him down?

2590
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:33,600
Are we just gonna go and blast him?

2591
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:34,920
What should we do?

2592
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:41,640
Why did you do that?

2593
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:45,260
I think he's going and blasting.

2594
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:49,620
How did he not get caught?

2595
02:43:58,070 --> 02:43:59,730
Oh my god!

2596
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:05,570
Oh man!

2597
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:18,760
I always forget to reload this thing.

2598
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:20,820
Wow!

2599
02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:28,280
Oh yeah, start taking the guys home.

2600
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:30,560
Oh, I don't think this guy is alive anymore.

2601
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:37,380
Where could we be?

2602
02:44:45,740 --> 02:44:46,220
I

2603
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:05,230
think I need it pretty bad.

2604
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:08,210
Help who?

2605
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:08,850
Oh

2606
02:45:13,290 --> 02:45:37,260
I'm out of ammo!

2607
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:39,280
Take who down?

2608
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:41,560
The Kapitan!

2609
02:45:50,890 --> 02:45:51,910
I'm taking him!

2610
02:45:51,970 --> 02:45:53,550
I shot him, but you know...

2611
02:45:55,850 --> 02:45:56,810
He's still alive.

2612
02:45:57,030 --> 02:45:58,850
He's so good at eating those bullets.

2613
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:05,110
That was all you Minto.

2614
02:46:05,730 --> 02:46:13,600
Yeah, they were sleep bullets.

2615
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:14,960
Rubber bullets, so true.

2616
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:16,960
So true.

2617
02:46:21,570 --> 02:46:23,370
Yeah, let's go!

2618
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:23,590
Let's go!

2619
02:46:28,390 --> 02:46:31,790
Good job team, good job team.

2620
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:37,430
So serious.

2621
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:49,680
Someone didn't get the memo.

2622
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:55,820
On Saturdays we wear pink.

2623
02:46:58,990 --> 02:46:59,490
Nice.

2624
02:47:01,110 --> 02:47:02,970
Good job everybody, good job.

2625
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:07,490
That was so good.

2626
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:10,270
Chico?

2627
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:15,760
Intruder detected.

2628
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:17,620
Oh no!

2629
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:24,990
This is what happens.

2630
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:25,950
This is what I do too.

2631
02:47:27,700 --> 02:47:28,570
I'm fultoning.

2632
02:47:30,610 --> 02:47:31,470
Nice.

2633
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:39,710
House.

2634
02:47:41,850 --> 02:47:44,850
How does it move so fast though with her, you know?

2635
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:48,250
It shouldn't be moving that quickly.

2636
02:47:50,210 --> 02:47:50,730
OK.

2637
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:55,850
Chico Libri.

2638
02:48:01,650 --> 02:48:02,690
You got this!

2639
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:04,990
It's not letting me do anything yet.

2640
02:48:06,870 --> 02:48:07,490
No!

2641
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:12,400
She's gonna say what is though.

2642
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:14,740
I didn't go for that.

2643
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:18,740
Shoot her.

2644
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:24,260
Are you OK?

2645
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:25,720
Amanda, are you good?

2646
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:36,000
No, Chico.

2647
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,660
She gotta have her smokes.

2648
02:48:44,220 --> 02:48:45,060
He gets it.

2649
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:12,200
OK.

2650
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:30,620
Sorry, I'm snacking.

2651
02:49:42,350 --> 02:49:45,100
That's what I can do with all my cocaine.

2652
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:49,880
Banana factory.

2653
02:49:59,010 --> 02:50:00,960
Her bones!

2654
02:50:02,180 --> 02:50:03,480
Feet!

2655
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:10,660
Yes, ma'am!

2656
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:17,580
The bones, the bones.

2657
02:50:42,980 --> 02:50:43,540
Yes,

2658
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:49,400
ma 'am.

2659
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:51,500
Even the banana factory won't take the coke.

2660
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:56,620
For anybody who doesn't know what I'm talking about, just watch the Keep Driving stream.

2661
02:50:56,620 --> 02:50:58,340
You're going after that cargo?

2662
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:02,400
People probably like, what is Miss doing with cocaine?

2663
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:26,820
Ahem.

2664
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:43,160
Chico!

2665
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:50,780
Don't spawn me in with nothing.

2666
02:51:50,900 --> 02:51:51,660
Oh, what the heck?

2667
02:51:52,700 --> 02:51:53,460
You're great!

2668
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:54,240
Thanks, Nailo!

2669
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:56,060
Thanks for joining us.

2670
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:10,080
OK.

2671
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:37,020
If he gives in, if he's about to sell out his compas, please, at least let him keep his honor.

2672
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:37,820
No.

2673
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:41,220
That's a promise I can't make.

2674
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,360
Why?

2675
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:51,680
Amanda, we gave up our homes, but we're still alive.

2676
02:52:52,860 --> 02:52:54,600
We're still fighting.

2677
02:52:56,420 --> 02:53:00,300
And there's always another reason to keep on living.

2678
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,540
This theme is too good.

2679
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:08,720
I feel alive again.

2680
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:14,980
Amanda, join my unit until you've healed up.

2681
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:18,560
Your unit?

2682
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:19,800
Yeah.

2683
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:21,680
Who are you?

2684
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:23,260
Why are you here?

2685
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:25,120
I'm a photographer.

2686
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:31,040
That was unnecessary.

2687
02:53:35,580 --> 02:53:36,960
My reaction too.

2688
02:53:40,660 --> 02:53:41,480
You're a snake?

2689
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:53,260
Oh boy.

2690
02:54:01,640 --> 02:54:03,760
Good night, little princess.

2691
02:54:04,740 --> 02:54:05,960
Let's fold in your way.

2692
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:14,600
Kaz is like, a woman?

2693
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:15,160
She?

2694
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:18,620
You think that's where they're taking the nukes?

2695
02:54:18,780 --> 02:54:19,800
I'm sure of it.

2696
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:20,720
Let's move.

2697
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:22,640
Let's move.

2698
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:26,220
I gave her the sleeping cigs.

2699
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:32,260
Oh yeah, the one that you smoke it and the smoke blows in their face.

2700
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:44,720
3 kills.

2701
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:49,780
We got 5 guys.

2702
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:55,620
Those are all you guys, so thank you.

2703
02:54:57,580 --> 02:54:59,620
Oh we got the tank!

2704
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:00,580
Yippee!

2705
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:03,120
Tortilla chips!

2706
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:06,960
Burgers and fries.

2707
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:08,420
Soft drink!

2708
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:11,940
Banana.

2709
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:18,640
Snake.

2710
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:21,420
Amanda, how do you feel?

2711
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:23,960
Some first helicopter ride.

2712
02:55:24,580 --> 02:55:26,580
I'll be perfectly happy if it's my last.

2713
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:29,840
She would look better with a bandana on her head.

2714
02:55:33,220 --> 02:55:42,080
If you have any questions about American bases or mercenary units or about El Frente, just ask.

2715
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:47,200
And please, do not forget my compas and Chico.

2716
02:55:47,860 --> 02:55:48,680
Don't worry.

2717
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:51,500
It's good to be working with you, boss.

2718
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:55,080
Snake, we can monitor her condition in sickbay.

2719
02:55:55,720 --> 02:55:59,280
Remember to assign roles to any POWs you bring back to Mother Base.

2720
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,440
How this outfit gets built depends on who we assign to what jobs.

2721
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:05,840
That will determine how Mother Base grows.

2722
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:08,080
It's one of your most important roles, boss.

2723
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:08,520
I'm doing it!

2724
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:09,060
I'm doing it!

2725
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:10,460
Yeah, I know.

2726
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:11,940
Oh gosh!

2727
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:13,920
I know!

2728
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:19,270
Boss, one more thing.

2729
02:56:19,390 --> 02:56:20,110
Now what?

2730
02:56:20,450 --> 02:56:21,350
It's about sickbay.

2731
02:56:21,790 --> 02:56:25,070
Naturally we can use it for the sick or injured like we did with Amanda.

2732
02:56:25,530 --> 02:56:28,370
But we can't expect people to get better without the proper treatment.

2733
02:56:29,550 --> 02:56:32,150
So I figure we'll need a medical team for that.

2734
02:56:32,530 --> 02:56:37,010
The number of team members and their abilities will determine how quickly the sick and injured heal.

2735
02:56:37,330 --> 02:56:38,970
They can also monitor everybody's health.

2736
02:56:38,970 --> 02:56:41,370
Why is everybody not just healthy all the time?

2737
02:56:46,690 --> 02:56:47,450
Sink.

2738
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:52,030
I am big boss.

2739
02:56:54,030 --> 02:56:54,790
Amanda.

2740
02:56:56,790 --> 02:56:58,030
She's so pretty.

2741
02:56:59,750 --> 02:57:02,550
Look at our little Mother Base.

2742
02:57:02,610 --> 02:57:03,910
It'll get much bigger though.

2743
02:57:04,330 --> 02:57:05,770
It'll become way bigger.

2744
02:57:06,730 --> 02:57:07,490
PTSD!

2745
02:57:11,390 --> 02:57:13,430
Tortilla chips.

2746
02:57:19,790 --> 02:57:21,690
Bayleed Whale!

2747
02:57:23,330 --> 02:57:26,910
You are now the matria libre of...what does that mean?

2748
02:57:28,190 --> 02:57:29,210
Mongoose!

2749
02:57:31,170 --> 02:57:33,270
Everybody get along now, okay?

2750
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:34,890
You're next.

2751
02:57:37,130 --> 02:57:39,350
Why did you specify bandana on her head?

2752
02:57:40,770 --> 02:57:45,010
Maybe I'm just overthinking things but you got quite more freaky than normal today.

2753
02:57:45,470 --> 02:57:45,690
What?

2754
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:48,410
It's because she's already wearing a bandana on her neck.

2755
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:54,550
And I think she would look good with a bandana on her head like Snake has.

2756
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:54,990
What?

2757
02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:56,510
I'm the freaky one?

2758
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:57,970
You're the freaky one!

2759
02:57:58,170 --> 02:57:59,570
Get your head out of the gutter!

2760
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:01,930
I'm talking as like...as an accessory!

2761
02:58:03,290 --> 02:58:04,870
You're talking weird!

2762
02:58:06,410 --> 02:58:07,090
What?

2763
02:58:07,930 --> 02:58:08,930
Freaky where?

2764
02:58:09,470 --> 02:58:10,750
Bro is the freaky one?

2765
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:11,010
Yeah!

2766
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:13,330
You just called yourself out.

2767
02:58:18,330 --> 02:58:20,690
You...you just self-reported.

2768
02:58:25,510 --> 02:58:26,870
Classic projections.

2769
02:58:28,070 --> 02:58:30,470
My first MGS game and I got to play with my OG.

2770
02:58:30,590 --> 02:58:31,170
Let's go!

2771
02:58:31,730 --> 02:58:32,530
Thank you.

2772
02:58:34,270 --> 02:58:35,050
Sus.

2773
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:40,910
That was a classic where I...

2774
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:46,190
I'm not seeing your response, ducky.

2775
02:58:49,270 --> 02:58:50,710
You're a little embarrassed about that?

2776
02:58:53,450 --> 02:58:55,710
How would it even be freaky?

2777
02:58:57,750 --> 02:58:58,530
How?

2778
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:00,450
I regret nothing.

2779
02:59:01,890 --> 02:59:02,530
Let's see.

2780
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:04,910
We've got Manta Ray.

2781
02:59:06,630 --> 02:59:08,330
No need for you to go, boss.

2782
02:59:08,510 --> 02:59:09,650
I've got this one covered.

2783
02:59:09,830 --> 02:59:10,850
I don't think you do.

2784
02:59:10,970 --> 02:59:11,830
We got Beetle.

2785
02:59:14,170 --> 02:59:19,250
You ever hear...you ever hear of these battle cries that make amazing things happen sometimes when you say them?

2786
02:59:19,470 --> 02:59:19,970
Crazy, huh?

2787
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:21,650
What the hell?

2788
02:59:21,710 --> 02:59:22,950
Let's have some fun out there!

2789
02:59:23,390 --> 02:59:24,170
Says Hamster.

2790
02:59:30,360 --> 02:59:33,700
Okay, let's go to All.

2791
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:39,990
Because we're going to need some people in the sickbay.

2792
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:41,310
Or the medical team, I mean.

2793
02:59:42,450 --> 02:59:43,950
To take care of those in the sickbay.

2794
02:59:46,270 --> 02:59:50,050
So, Master Miller belongs in the food, to be honest.

2795
02:59:50,190 --> 02:59:52,070
But we'll keep him where he's at for now.

2796
02:59:52,210 --> 02:59:53,230
Where do I have NR&D?

2797
02:59:55,290 --> 03:00:01,670
Until we get, like, a stinky guy to go into NR&D, we'll keep Miller in there for now.

2798
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:04,310
Let's see.

2799
03:00:12,030 --> 03:00:12,570
Lungfish.

2800
03:00:12,990 --> 03:00:14,630
I transfer you to medical team.

2801
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:21,660
Oh, sorry.

2802
03:00:21,740 --> 03:00:23,480
I just realized my head is blocking it.

2803
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:26,160
Just trust.

2804
03:00:26,260 --> 03:00:26,820
Just trust.

2805
03:00:27,540 --> 03:00:29,580
Okay, he was the only one that was good.

2806
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:31,360
Everybody else is E.

2807
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:36,920
We'll send some of the guys, like Orefish, he's all E's.

2808
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:39,460
So we'll send him to medical team too.

2809
03:00:41,720 --> 03:00:42,620
We have faith.

2810
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:43,860
You can sort by...you can?

2811
03:00:48,010 --> 03:00:48,790
List mode?

2812
03:00:49,010 --> 03:00:49,230
No.

2813
03:00:51,850 --> 03:00:52,810
How to sort?

2814
03:00:57,470 --> 03:00:58,050
How...

2815
03:01:00,830 --> 03:01:01,410
Start?

2816
03:01:03,210 --> 03:01:04,430
Ah, thank you.

2817
03:01:06,430 --> 03:01:07,330
Okay, okay.

2818
03:01:07,550 --> 03:01:08,170
Thank you!

2819
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:10,970
Alright, so I put Lungfish in there.

2820
03:01:11,750 --> 03:01:15,030
No, why would he be in medical?

2821
03:01:15,210 --> 03:01:16,810
Oh, I guess that's his second best thing.

2822
03:01:18,130 --> 03:01:20,210
But they belong in NR&D.

2823
03:01:23,730 --> 03:01:25,110
It's probably okay for now.

2824
03:01:25,650 --> 03:01:26,670
Show them who's boss.

2825
03:01:27,790 --> 03:01:29,190
It's probably fine for now.

2826
03:01:29,330 --> 03:01:31,490
Did we have anything that we could...

2827
03:01:31,490 --> 03:01:32,330
Besides that?

2828
03:01:32,690 --> 03:01:33,190
Items?

2829
03:01:34,510 --> 03:01:35,510
Tortilla chips.

2830
03:01:38,490 --> 03:01:39,490
And we got a tank.

2831
03:01:40,190 --> 03:01:40,690
Let's go.

2832
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:42,370
What?

2833
03:01:42,370 --> 03:01:42,450
Alright.

2834
03:01:45,890 --> 03:01:47,550
Oh no!

2835
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:49,090
Who's driving this thing?

2836
03:01:50,130 --> 03:01:51,130
Drift!

2837
03:01:52,930 --> 03:01:54,210
Drift!

2838
03:01:57,890 --> 03:01:59,810
It's a bumpy ride.

2839
03:02:03,150 --> 03:02:04,770
Choose your gear carefully.

2840
03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:05,810
Okay!

2841
03:02:07,970 --> 03:02:09,310
Back to mission.

2842
03:02:15,890 --> 03:02:16,990
Rescue Chico!

2843
03:02:19,710 --> 03:02:22,330
Is this actually the one where I rescue Chico?

2844
03:02:23,310 --> 03:02:24,730
Or is it the next mission?

2845
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:29,750
I'm asking about the one where we have to search each...

2846
03:02:30,910 --> 03:02:32,050
each place.

2847
03:02:37,610 --> 03:02:39,430
Like the different buildings.

2848
03:02:42,830 --> 03:02:45,550
So we need you to infiltrate one of their bases.

2849
03:02:45,910 --> 03:02:46,910
A prison facility.

2850
03:02:47,450 --> 03:02:48,030
That's an app.

2851
03:02:48,250 --> 03:02:48,750
Not a tank.

2852
03:02:49,430 --> 03:02:49,690
My bad.

2853
03:02:50,250 --> 03:02:50,450
Nerd.

2854
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:55,090
This is the one with the searching doors.

2855
03:02:55,230 --> 03:02:56,190
Okay, I want to do this one.

2856
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:01,930
I want to do this one myself then.

2857
03:03:07,390 --> 03:03:07,750
Yeah.

2858
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:08,210
Amanda.

2859
03:03:10,590 --> 03:03:11,170
Lucia.

2860
03:03:14,490 --> 03:03:15,650
Okay.

2861
03:03:25,550 --> 03:03:26,250
Peepholes!

2862
03:03:29,250 --> 03:03:30,410
What pervs!

2863
03:03:33,710 --> 03:03:35,250
Thank you!

2864
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:35,370
Hello!

2865
03:03:36,250 --> 03:03:39,370
I'm going to do this one single because I like going through the different houses.

2866
03:03:40,750 --> 03:03:42,990
So I hope you guys don't mind.

2867
03:03:43,430 --> 03:03:44,490
I think we're good.

2868
03:03:44,610 --> 03:03:45,910
We'll go back to...

2869
03:03:52,070 --> 03:03:53,470
We're in concrete?

2870
03:03:55,310 --> 03:03:59,330
Maybe we should do like a different fatigue.

2871
03:04:00,190 --> 03:04:01,210
Some different camo.

2872
03:04:03,490 --> 03:04:03,790
Nah.

2873
03:04:05,050 --> 03:04:05,570
Survival.

2874
03:04:07,630 --> 03:04:08,790
Maybe we're fine.

2875
03:04:09,150 --> 03:04:10,130
Do the Tiger Stripe.

2876
03:04:10,470 --> 03:04:11,070
Is it better?

2877
03:04:11,970 --> 03:04:12,410
Survival.

2878
03:04:16,290 --> 03:04:16,550
You.

2879
03:04:20,270 --> 03:04:22,390
I don't really have much of anything else.

2880
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:25,390
This is fine.

2881
03:04:27,010 --> 03:04:27,450
Okay.

2882
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:32,360
Fulton.

2883
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:33,160
Russian.

2884
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:34,700
Oh.

2885
03:04:35,260 --> 03:04:35,500
Eco.

2886
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:40,060
Tiger Stripe is good for your great indoors.

2887
03:04:40,500 --> 03:04:43,480
This is a membership chat.

2888
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:44,400
Thank you!

2889
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:47,920
Thank you very much!

2890
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:54,380
Okay.

2891
03:04:58,280 --> 03:04:59,380
I see.

2892
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:02,860
Oh, I'm sorry chat kind of blocks the... what's it called?

2893
03:05:04,500 --> 03:05:05,460
The radar.

2894
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:10,280
It's just...

2895
03:05:12,640 --> 03:05:15,820
It's lighting up a little bit over this yonder.

2896
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:16,640
Over yonder.

2897
03:05:19,180 --> 03:05:19,840
Oh, I see him.

2898
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:26,700
I got him.

2899
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:28,840
Oh, did I?

2900
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:31,760
I think I...

2901
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:32,940
Didn't... No.

2902
03:05:33,060 --> 03:05:34,020
I don't think it was done.

2903
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:35,280
The... What's it called?

2904
03:05:37,420 --> 03:05:37,940
The...

2905
03:05:39,140 --> 03:05:41,800
I don't think I should waste my Fultons.

2906
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:43,600
What if he sucks?

2907
03:05:46,940 --> 03:05:47,980
The analyzer.

2908
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:48,460
Yeah, yeah.

2909
03:05:51,780 --> 03:05:53,620
Maybe we're fine leaving him.

2910
03:05:53,780 --> 03:05:54,600
I don't want to waste it.

2911
03:05:54,980 --> 03:05:55,620
How many do I have?

2912
03:05:59,270 --> 03:05:59,790
Ten!

2913
03:06:00,270 --> 03:06:00,970
Maybe it's okay.

2914
03:06:02,870 --> 03:06:03,170
Oops.

2915
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:05,970
I do want your stuff also.

2916
03:06:06,350 --> 03:06:07,150
I'm taking it home.

2917
03:06:10,730 --> 03:06:11,870
What if he's good?

2918
03:06:13,210 --> 03:06:14,010
You're right.

2919
03:06:14,130 --> 03:06:14,570
You're right.

2920
03:06:14,770 --> 03:06:15,230
You're right.

2921
03:06:15,370 --> 03:06:15,910
You're alright.

2922
03:06:29,570 --> 03:06:30,610
You're right.

2923
03:06:30,810 --> 03:06:31,670
We'll take them all home.

2924
03:06:32,710 --> 03:06:34,010
These are our men.

2925
03:06:34,850 --> 03:06:36,170
And I love them equally.

2926
03:06:36,170 --> 03:06:38,990
Every single one of them is coming home with me.

2927
03:06:39,710 --> 03:06:41,050
Think of it as gotcha.

2928
03:06:41,730 --> 03:06:45,310
One of them... What if the one I left behind... What if he was leech?

2929
03:06:47,370 --> 03:06:47,870
What basin?

2930
03:06:51,730 --> 03:06:52,710
What basin?

2931
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:53,730
What are you talking about?

2932
03:06:55,450 --> 03:06:56,910
What are you talking about?

2933
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:06,750
Junction.

2934
03:07:07,390 --> 03:07:07,690
Okay.

2935
03:07:08,530 --> 03:07:10,210
We're gonna go to the left.

2936
03:07:13,010 --> 03:07:14,590
Master collection volume 2 win.

2937
03:07:14,710 --> 03:07:15,430
I know!

2938
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:17,890
Right?

2939
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:30,160
I got a little...

2940
03:07:30,720 --> 03:07:32,020
A little distraction.

2941
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:34,140
A little thing to kind of...

2942
03:07:34,140 --> 03:07:35,500
Throw you off your way.

2943
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:45,120
I don't think I can get that guy.

2944
03:07:45,460 --> 03:07:47,540
I do remember kind of there being...

2945
03:07:59,880 --> 03:08:00,420
Who said that?

2946
03:08:03,480 --> 03:08:04,140
Oh my god.

2947
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:04,580
This guy.

2948
03:08:05,420 --> 03:08:06,240
You son of a bitch.

2949
03:08:06,980 --> 03:08:07,680
Leave me alone!

2950
03:08:11,580 --> 03:08:13,100
Are you not shooting at me?

2951
03:08:13,240 --> 03:08:14,460
Why are you so confused?

2952
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:21,040
Damn it.

2953
03:08:21,060 --> 03:08:21,580
That was so close.

2954
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:24,260
I saw it like zoom past the front of his face.

2955
03:08:26,660 --> 03:08:27,240
Got him.

2956
03:08:28,720 --> 03:08:29,600
Nothing here.

2957
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:32,520
I think that's the only sniper?

2958
03:08:32,760 --> 03:08:33,460
I was gonna say...

2959
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:35,480
I was literally the sentence saying...

2960
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:37,680
I think I remember a sniper being over there.

2961
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:40,420
And then he totally got me.

2962
03:08:42,400 --> 03:08:43,780
Take him home.

2963
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:46,140
Sniper.

2964
03:08:47,640 --> 03:08:48,940
Was there one over here?

2965
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:49,260
No.

2966
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:57,900
Take you home too.

2967
03:08:57,900 --> 03:09:00,080
You're gonna extract him?

2968
03:09:01,620 --> 03:09:02,000
Oh!

2969
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:03,180
I forgot.

2970
03:09:03,460 --> 03:09:08,000
Next game we'll have to deal with Kazuhira's judginess over who I...

2971
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:12,300
Who I deem worthy of joining our cause.

2972
03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:15,240
Come here.

2973
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,500
Come here little prisoner.

2974
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,680
I wish I could get him down.

2975
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:25,420
I don't ever remember how to do it.

2976
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:28,880
I wish I could grab him though.

2977
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:30,840
Aren't the snipers pretty good?

2978
03:09:33,820 --> 03:09:35,340
You're right there!

2979
03:09:35,460 --> 03:09:35,720
Please!

2980
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:37,660
Please!

2981
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:43,720
Oh well.

2982
03:09:48,390 --> 03:09:48,830
Too bad.

2983
03:09:48,930 --> 03:09:49,550
So sad.

2984
03:09:50,810 --> 03:09:52,350
Fulton Mine or Rocket Launcher?

2985
03:09:52,490 --> 03:09:52,950
Dang.

2986
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:55,910
The snipers have the best stats.

2987
03:09:55,990 --> 03:09:57,170
Just tease players.

2988
03:09:57,870 --> 03:09:58,810
They're just little teases.

2989
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:10,920
I'll find him.

2990
03:10:14,130 --> 03:10:15,090
I think I can get him.

2991
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:25,680
Take him home.

2992
03:10:27,060 --> 03:10:29,000
So the blue doors.

2993
03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:31,680
But I like this part because you can hear all the funny...

2994
03:10:32,340 --> 03:10:33,200
What's... Oh my gosh.

2995
03:10:33,620 --> 03:10:34,400
Spook the heck out of me.

2996
03:10:40,580 --> 03:10:41,040
Blind.

2997
03:10:41,040 --> 03:10:42,360
Absolutely blind.

2998
03:10:42,420 --> 03:10:42,960
All of them.

2999
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,360
Nice shot.

3000
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:45,900
Thank you.

3001
03:10:46,840 --> 03:10:47,820
That's a blue door?

3002
03:11:04,700 --> 03:11:06,340
I'm too good at the game.

3003
03:11:06,420 --> 03:11:06,760
I'm sorry.

3004
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:07,480
No!

3005
03:11:07,900 --> 03:11:09,500
I was literally just saying!

3006
03:11:16,220 --> 03:11:16,780
No!

3007
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:21,240
I wanted to hear the other...

3008
03:11:26,580 --> 03:11:28,060
The birds of the valley.

3009
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:41,520
I'm too good.

3010
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:43,920
I'm just too good.

3011
03:11:46,040 --> 03:11:47,760
I didn't even get to collect that guy.

3012
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:48,660
I took down...

3013
03:11:48,660 --> 03:11:51,180
It's just a broken leg.

3014
03:11:52,540 --> 03:11:57,240
This is where Big Boss becomes a little crazy.

3015
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:10,700
Look at Chico's face.

3016
03:12:12,020 --> 03:12:14,700
He's got no thoughts behind that eye.

3017
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:18,880
Yeah.

3018
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,940
Disappears.

3019
03:12:53,400 --> 03:12:54,800
What?

3020
03:13:00,560 --> 03:13:03,360
Close enough.

3021
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:11,100
I'm just making fun of my weight.

3022
03:13:24,240 --> 03:13:25,640
Hmm?

3023
03:13:31,980 --> 03:13:33,380
Okay.

3024
03:13:49,360 --> 03:13:51,940
Something that could keep the world in balance.

3025
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,200
Or destroy it.

3026
03:13:58,360 --> 03:13:59,440
His face!

3027
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:01,440
Hole?

3028
03:14:02,740 --> 03:14:03,100
Hole?

3029
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:07,220
Look, I get it.

3030
03:14:07,660 --> 03:14:09,540
Even revolutionaries need to pay the bills.

3031
03:14:10,360 --> 03:14:13,020
Still, it must be tough for a kid like you to swallow.

3032
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,040
You're damn right it is!

3033
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:20,720
The road they use to transport stuff is the same one mi viejo used to smuggle drugs.

3034
03:14:21,820 --> 03:14:26,340
They sold the drugs to the norteamericanos and used the profits to fund the army.

3035
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:31,220
They tried to keep it hidden from me.

3036
03:14:32,580 --> 03:14:34,140
Is that why you went camping?

3037
03:14:35,240 --> 03:14:35,640
Yes.

3038
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:40,800
I managed to sneak into the plant a few times and...

3039
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:42,420
I tried to set it on fire.

3040
03:14:42,420 --> 03:14:44,420
Oh my god, arson arc.

3041
03:14:52,660 --> 03:14:54,560
This is a Disney movie moment.

3042
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:56,660
I'm not a kid anymore!

3043
03:14:57,100 --> 03:14:58,140
I'm 13 years old!

3044
03:15:13,320 --> 03:15:14,480
Mi viejo!

3045
03:15:19,260 --> 03:15:20,260
Dad!

3046
03:15:20,880 --> 03:15:21,240
Dad!

3047
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:25,560
Mi viejo!

3048
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:43,780
I can't go back.

3049
03:15:44,160 --> 03:15:45,680
I can't face everybody.

3050
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:50,140
You told them where your compas are.

3051
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:55,680
Time to die!

3052
03:15:58,240 --> 03:16:00,020
Nothing to be ashamed of.

3053
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:01,860
Pain gets the better of us all.

3054
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:02,020
No!

3055
03:16:10,550 --> 03:16:12,500
He's trying to reassure him.

3056
03:16:16,360 --> 03:16:17,700
Snake!

3057
03:16:32,580 --> 03:16:34,640
Chico's not a man!

3058
03:16:48,220 --> 03:16:50,220
So good.

3059
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:05,620
Huh?

3060
03:17:06,760 --> 03:17:08,400
Fight with me, little soldier.

3061
03:17:08,860 --> 03:17:10,940
Show me how strong you really are.

3062
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:12,340
Yeah, our first child, soldier!

3063
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:13,000
Let's go!

3064
03:17:14,900 --> 03:17:16,220
Dry your tears.

3065
03:17:16,760 --> 03:17:18,220
Then promise me one thing.

3066
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:21,780
No smoking until you get older.

3067
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:29,520
Remember, real heroes are never as polished as the legends that surround them.

3068
03:17:32,160 --> 03:17:33,740
You got it, boss.

3069
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:36,360
Snake is fine.

3070
03:17:37,340 --> 03:17:37,880
What's that?

3071
03:17:39,820 --> 03:17:40,620
Get faulted!

3072
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:46,740
Rescue Chico mission complete!

3073
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:53,560
Maybe we'll go back and do that one and like...

3074
03:17:55,340 --> 03:17:57,740
We can listen to the other doors and stuff.

3075
03:18:04,460 --> 03:18:05,120
Hmm...

3076
03:18:05,780 --> 03:18:06,460
C4?

3077
03:18:10,500 --> 03:18:11,500
Support strike.

3078
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:12,440
Oh nice!

3079
03:18:15,620 --> 03:18:17,720
It's a short mission, yeah.

3080
03:18:19,360 --> 03:18:20,400
Chico!

3081
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:22,260
Chico!

3082
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:27,620
What?

3083
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:32,400
That's such a...that's such a dramatic...

3084
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:46,020
What's special about the other doors?

3085
03:18:46,020 --> 03:18:52,620
The other...the other prisoners just say funny things.

3086
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:03,020
I mean but he...

3087
03:19:03,940 --> 03:19:06,020
But he is...

3088
03:19:10,900 --> 03:19:11,860
He's only twelve!

3089
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:24,200
I think though...

3090
03:19:25,100 --> 03:19:26,920
It's kind of like the situation he's in, right?

3091
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:31,360
You don't want to treat him so much like a kid.

3092
03:19:32,580 --> 03:19:34,980
Yeah, I'll talk once with him.

3093
03:19:46,020 --> 03:19:46,040
Shoot.

3094
03:19:51,640 --> 03:19:53,260
Oh, they haven't survived.

3095
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:58,100
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

3096
03:20:11,820 --> 03:20:13,420
It's okay.

3097
03:20:16,560 --> 03:20:18,900
The UMAs.

3098
03:20:18,940 --> 03:20:20,680
Yeah, the UMAs.

3099
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:29,340
Is that right?

3100
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:31,860
Okay, sure.

3101
03:20:33,180 --> 03:20:37,180
Welcome to the reason why there's Monster Hunter Controls.

3102
03:20:58,020 --> 03:21:00,600
Yeah, I was saying earlier though.

3103
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:02,100
I don't want to talk over them.

3104
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:06,120
But it's like if you...Goddammit Miller!

3105
03:21:17,540 --> 03:21:18,140
Ads.

3106
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:30,540
Yeah, Snake is so sassy.

3107
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:38,080
Okay.

3108
03:21:42,580 --> 03:21:46,560
But when it's like...

3109
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:50,200
You don't want to treat him like a kid where he knows nothing.

3110
03:21:50,980 --> 03:21:53,820
Because that could be so dangerous for him, you know what I mean?

3111
03:21:53,820 --> 03:21:59,700
Yeah, he's a kid, but at the same time you have to be like...

3112
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:04,420
You have to make sure that he doesn't do something stupid because he's just ill-informed.

3113
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:10,820
Snake loves child soldiers, so...

3114
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:13,100
Tortilla chips!

3115
03:22:16,780 --> 03:22:18,460
A new plant has been built.

3116
03:22:18,840 --> 03:22:19,280
Let's go.

3117
03:22:19,660 --> 03:22:20,540
We're expanding.

3118
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:21,940
Holy moly.

3119
03:22:25,120 --> 03:22:26,660
Every snake does?

3120
03:22:28,280 --> 03:22:30,240
A solid snake like child soldier?

3121
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:32,980
Yeah, Sunny.

3122
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:34,780
She's not really a soldier.

3123
03:22:39,220 --> 03:22:39,920
Alright.

3124
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:41,120
No, we're good.

3125
03:22:41,200 --> 03:22:42,000
I think we got it.

3126
03:22:42,300 --> 03:22:43,020
We got well!

3127
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:47,380
Wow.

3128
03:22:48,660 --> 03:22:49,180
Chico.

3129
03:22:50,440 --> 03:22:53,060
Ancient dinosaurs and rare monsters.

3130
03:22:53,380 --> 03:22:57,060
I actually kind of like the way you fight.

3131
03:22:57,960 --> 03:23:00,180
Oh, this is the guy that was...

3132
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:04,380
That was in the brig.

3133
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:11,640
What?

3134
03:23:17,690 --> 03:23:20,070
What is the square box stat?

3135
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:21,970
What square box?

3136
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:26,830
Oh, the one that currently says E?

3137
03:23:27,310 --> 03:23:28,970
That is...

3138
03:23:35,860 --> 03:23:36,860
Is that the recon?

3139
03:23:38,380 --> 03:23:40,140
I could go for a nice cold soda.

3140
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:44,120
Oh wait, I forgot to read the names.

3141
03:23:44,460 --> 03:23:47,160
Mongoose, another genet...

3142
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:47,480
Intel?

3143
03:23:47,780 --> 03:23:48,560
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3144
03:23:48,960 --> 03:23:49,340
Horse!

3145
03:23:49,980 --> 03:23:52,140
I got two yolks in my egg this morning.

3146
03:23:52,600 --> 03:23:54,580
So I'm going to work twice as hard today.

3147
03:23:54,580 --> 03:23:56,600
Or at least complain half as much.

3148
03:23:57,700 --> 03:23:58,140
Anaconda.

3149
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:01,180
I got a daughter.

3150
03:24:01,400 --> 03:24:02,640
She's going to be 12 next year.

3151
03:24:02,860 --> 03:24:04,380
I have to make it out of this alive.

3152
03:24:05,220 --> 03:24:06,100
Surf Perch.

3153
03:24:07,420 --> 03:24:12,300
Wish I could see the Loch Ness Monster or Quetzalcoatl once in my life.

3154
03:24:14,980 --> 03:24:16,460
He wants to see the pretzel.

3155
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:17,700
Minky!

3156
03:24:23,790 --> 03:24:24,670
No way!

3157
03:24:25,150 --> 03:24:26,450
We got Monkey!

3158
03:24:29,730 --> 03:24:32,590
Before I became a mercenary, I was a doctor.

3159
03:24:33,830 --> 03:24:36,050
Would you like to try this new drug I'm working on?

3160
03:24:36,610 --> 03:24:39,750
Why do you have zero medic stat?

3161
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:41,470
If you are a medic.

3162
03:24:42,890 --> 03:24:44,990
Monkey, I think you need to find a new profession.

3163
03:24:49,850 --> 03:24:50,330
Nice.

3164
03:24:51,810 --> 03:24:53,810
We got Chico under Intel.

3165
03:24:54,010 --> 03:24:54,490
Let's go.

3166
03:24:55,250 --> 03:24:56,690
Amanda is still sick.

3167
03:24:57,090 --> 03:24:58,230
When can I move her out?

3168
03:25:01,170 --> 03:25:02,870
I guess it will let me know.

3169
03:25:03,890 --> 03:25:05,330
It will let me know.

3170
03:25:06,550 --> 03:25:07,190
Let's see.

3171
03:25:07,450 --> 03:25:08,550
What was the start?

3172
03:25:10,630 --> 03:25:11,890
Chico Miller.

3173
03:25:13,090 --> 03:25:13,730
Amanda.

3174
03:25:15,130 --> 03:25:16,650
Anaconda is already in there.

3175
03:25:17,790 --> 03:25:19,250
Chameleon shouldn't go in there.

3176
03:25:19,870 --> 03:25:20,290
Whatever.

3177
03:25:22,190 --> 03:25:23,830
I wasn't a good doctor.

3178
03:25:24,050 --> 03:25:25,070
That's why he changed jobs.

3179
03:25:25,910 --> 03:25:28,670
Check your in-game gift delivery when you get...

3180
03:25:29,290 --> 03:25:30,470
Wait, where is that again?

3181
03:25:31,030 --> 03:25:32,950
Also, we can see Mother Base, you guys.

3182
03:25:33,950 --> 03:25:35,070
Isn't it so beautiful?

3183
03:25:38,430 --> 03:25:39,790
This is us.

3184
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:40,830
This is our home.

3185
03:25:41,350 --> 03:25:43,150
This is Mother Base.

3186
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:51,200
It's small now, but it will be the biggest ever.

3187
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:53,260
It's getting bigger, I know.

3188
03:25:57,980 --> 03:25:59,660
I love brunette Mito.

3189
03:25:59,760 --> 03:26:00,820
I'm not brunette!

3190
03:26:02,740 --> 03:26:05,020
My hair is black right now.

3191
03:26:06,980 --> 03:26:08,040
But thank you.

3192
03:26:11,300 --> 03:26:11,940
Database.

3193
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:13,620
It's not this, no?

3194
03:26:14,540 --> 03:26:15,180
Log.

3195
03:26:15,620 --> 03:26:15,900
No.

3196
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:17,600
Oh wait, I think it's here.

3197
03:26:17,980 --> 03:26:18,380
Delivery!

3198
03:26:21,620 --> 03:26:23,160
No, we're okay.

3199
03:26:24,040 --> 03:26:24,880
Inbox!

3200
03:26:59,990 --> 03:27:00,950
It's okay.

3201
03:27:03,650 --> 03:27:06,310
I didn't want any gifts anyway.

3202
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:08,610
It's okay.

3203
03:27:10,490 --> 03:27:11,210
It's okay.

3204
03:27:11,470 --> 03:27:11,670
I

3205
03:27:18,800 --> 03:27:22,620
didn't...

3206
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:34,340
Happy White Day.

3207
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:37,600
Yes, I didn't stream on White Day.

3208
03:27:38,240 --> 03:27:41,040
I did it again.

3209
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:46,200
I think actually some people said off-stream donuts.

3210
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:49,160
For White Day, thank you.

3211
03:27:49,820 --> 03:27:52,820
But I didn't get so much for White Day.

3212
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:55,820
Even though I gave you something for Valentine's Day.

3213
03:27:58,500 --> 03:28:01,020
It's just how it is, I guess.

3214
03:28:12,540 --> 03:28:13,060
Tickle!

3215
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,520
I'm not a kid.

3216
03:28:15,620 --> 03:28:16,200
I'm 12.

3217
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:17,540
So funny.

3218
03:28:17,920 --> 03:28:21,000
Oh yeah, we have lots of extra ops we can do too.

3219
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:26,180
Target practice no limit.

3220
03:28:31,900 --> 03:28:33,600
Look at all these ones that we have.

3221
03:28:33,820 --> 03:28:36,120
Maybe we should do the classified documents.

3222
03:28:36,120 --> 03:28:37,540
What does it give us?

3223
03:28:41,780 --> 03:28:46,100
One minute for penalty for triggering an alert.

3224
03:28:49,260 --> 03:28:52,320
I'll probably save some of the extra ops for another day.

3225
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:57,080
I'm almost a little bit on a time limit because I'm meeting with some friends tonight.

3226
03:29:01,260 --> 03:29:02,460
Let's do...

3227
03:29:02,460 --> 03:29:04,140
Pursue the Jungle Train.

3228
03:29:11,620 --> 03:29:13,580
I want to do the first box though.

3229
03:29:14,420 --> 03:29:17,180
I think we'll be able to get to there at least.

3230
03:29:21,820 --> 03:29:22,340
Post!

3231
03:29:23,180 --> 03:29:24,600
Alright, get in here!

3232
03:29:26,140 --> 03:29:26,960
Get in here!

3233
03:29:27,180 --> 03:29:27,800
Get in here!

3234
03:29:29,700 --> 03:29:30,220
Micmac!

3235
03:29:31,980 --> 03:29:32,500
OK!

3236
03:29:33,100 --> 03:29:34,080
Are you already Micmac?

3237
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:35,620
I think I'm ready.

3238
03:29:36,800 --> 03:29:39,340
What is the location like?

3239
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:43,460
It sounds so horrible.

3240
03:29:44,580 --> 03:29:47,100
Why can't I talk to...

3241
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:49,680
Why can't I talk to Miller?

3242
03:30:05,620 --> 03:30:07,300
What is that?

3243
03:30:08,620 --> 03:30:10,020
Stout.

3244
03:30:13,860 --> 03:30:20,440
Good thing I'll be slithering around.

3245
03:30:22,240 --> 03:30:22,940
Bigfoot!

3246
03:30:28,260 --> 03:30:31,640
I get it.

3247
03:30:31,900 --> 03:30:32,360
So true.

3248
03:30:35,620 --> 03:30:36,400
I'm cool.

3249
03:30:36,860 --> 03:30:39,320
I'm cool, I'm cool.

3250
03:30:39,320 --> 03:30:41,060
You know a lot about this place.

3251
03:30:41,060 --> 03:30:42,060
What are you saying?

3252
03:30:42,660 --> 03:30:45,520
I've been there before, when the KGB ran it, yes.

3253
03:30:46,180 --> 03:30:47,900
But it is not as if I enjoyed it.

3254
03:30:48,220 --> 03:30:52,140
No, I just meant you know a lot about how the enemy works.

3255
03:30:52,420 --> 03:30:53,100
I hope so.

3256
03:30:53,440 --> 03:30:55,760
Anyway, did you talk to Chico about the terminal?

3257
03:30:56,060 --> 03:30:58,500
He said it's where they transfer the cargo onto trucks.

3258
03:30:58,640 --> 03:31:01,760
Meaning the facility is of considerable importance to them.

3259
03:31:02,340 --> 03:31:03,180
Don't get careless.

3260
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:04,180
I won't.

3261
03:31:04,180 --> 03:31:10,260
By the way, I've heard of a shortcut that cuts straight to the coffee factory to the east of the village.

3262
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:12,080
But I've never used it myself.

3263
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:14,220
Check it out if you're interested.

3264
03:31:14,360 --> 03:31:15,680
Thank you so much for the gift.

3265
03:31:16,020 --> 03:31:16,740
Thank you!

3266
03:31:18,300 --> 03:31:19,120
Thank you.

3267
03:31:19,380 --> 03:31:20,480
Oh my gosh, thank you.

3268
03:31:20,620 --> 03:31:21,460
Please, you're welcome.

3269
03:31:22,360 --> 03:31:22,840
Please!

3270
03:31:23,540 --> 03:31:24,360
OK, we're ready!

3271
03:31:24,520 --> 03:31:25,400
Let's go Big Mac!

3272
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:26,080
Let's go!

3273
03:31:40,040 --> 03:31:41,400
Love coffee factories.

3274
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:43,000
Make the whole area smell great.

3275
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:47,760
Do you peruse coffee factories often?

3276
03:31:51,640 --> 03:31:52,440
Try again.

3277
03:31:52,520 --> 03:31:55,320
Please try not to spam the same message over and over again.

3278
03:31:55,700 --> 03:31:57,660
I would like to play them in the future though, yes.

3279
03:32:05,640 --> 03:32:05,980
Sorry.

3280
03:32:06,220 --> 03:32:06,640
No worries.

3281
03:32:06,880 --> 03:32:07,600
Just letting you know.

3282
03:32:11,260 --> 03:32:14,640
The train terminal is on the other side of the coffee factory.

3283
03:32:14,880 --> 03:32:15,560
Big Mac!

3284
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,360
Big Mac!

3285
03:32:16,680 --> 03:32:17,200
Be careful!

3286
03:32:17,580 --> 03:32:18,440
She's right there!

3287
03:32:19,760 --> 03:32:23,980
To get to the coffee factory, you'll first need to backtrack to the fork in the road.

3288
03:32:26,820 --> 03:32:29,200
Did that just auto on him?

3289
03:32:30,940 --> 03:32:31,620
Don't move.

3290
03:32:40,320 --> 03:32:41,380
Slight aim correction.

3291
03:32:41,640 --> 03:32:43,020
Yeah, that was strange.

3292
03:32:45,080 --> 03:32:46,180
Where are you?

3293
03:32:46,540 --> 03:32:47,180
Oh, hi.

3294
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:53,280
Wait, is this the guy I did before?

3295
03:32:55,740 --> 03:32:56,740
Let's take him home.

3296
03:32:56,980 --> 03:32:58,640
Or is this the guy you just did?

3297
03:32:58,640 --> 03:33:00,940
Oh no, there is this guy over here.

3298
03:33:01,460 --> 03:33:02,280
Wait a second.

3299
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:05,260
A hand?

3300
03:33:05,820 --> 03:33:06,560
Hold on!

3301
03:33:07,160 --> 03:33:08,300
I want to take this guy.

3302
03:33:08,900 --> 03:33:10,080
I need all the men I can get.

3303
03:33:11,700 --> 03:33:12,620
Where are you?

3304
03:33:12,740 --> 03:33:13,840
I don't even know where you are.

3305
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:15,460
Oh, hi.

3306
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:16,380
I'm following.

3307
03:33:16,940 --> 03:33:17,420
I'm following.

3308
03:33:17,580 --> 03:33:17,820
I'm following.

3309
03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:21,100
No!

3310
03:33:21,540 --> 03:33:22,260
What the hell?

3311
03:33:27,880 --> 03:33:29,160
Why did you leave me?

3312
03:33:31,020 --> 03:33:32,160
Why did you leave me?

3313
03:33:36,960 --> 03:33:37,520
Someone's

3314
03:33:40,620 --> 03:33:41,180
coming.

3315
03:33:52,060 --> 03:33:54,080
Did you just kill that guy?

3316
03:33:56,280 --> 03:33:57,240
No, he's asleep.

3317
03:34:00,540 --> 03:34:01,440
Just a win.

3318
03:34:02,480 --> 03:34:03,520
Just a win.

3319
03:34:04,980 --> 03:34:05,460
I'm coming.

3320
03:34:05,620 --> 03:34:05,820
I'm coming.

3321
03:34:05,920 --> 03:34:06,160
I'm coming.

3322
03:34:06,260 --> 03:34:06,460
I'm coming.

3323
03:34:06,580 --> 03:34:06,780
I'm coming.

3324
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:10,980
Oops, sorry.

3325
03:34:11,220 --> 03:34:12,600
I took the bot.

3326
03:34:13,640 --> 03:34:14,280
Hold on.

3327
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:17,060
How do I set it down?

3328
03:34:18,680 --> 03:34:19,440
Wait, hold on.

3329
03:34:19,700 --> 03:34:20,700
How do I set it down?

3330
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:25,380
Oh, A to drop.

3331
03:34:26,300 --> 03:34:27,360
Or A.

3332
03:34:33,340 --> 03:34:34,140
There you go.

3333
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:49,000
Must be the win.

3334
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:50,400
I didn't know that there was a shortcut.

3335
03:34:51,260 --> 03:34:52,180
That's craziness.

3336
03:34:55,040 --> 03:34:55,900
Where are we?

3337
03:34:56,500 --> 03:34:57,220
Where are we going?

3338
03:34:59,880 --> 03:35:00,760
Oh there we are.

3339
03:35:03,300 --> 03:35:03,820
Okay.

3340
03:35:08,480 --> 03:35:09,240
You're running.

3341
03:35:10,380 --> 03:35:10,980
You're running.

3342
03:35:11,700 --> 03:35:12,120
This way?

3343
03:35:12,740 --> 03:35:13,600
Oh yeah, there we go.

3344
03:35:20,620 --> 03:35:22,340
What a show off.

3345
03:35:22,700 --> 03:35:24,540
This guy is such a show off.

3346
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:29,620
Oh, I have the fancy suit that makes no noise when I run.

3347
03:35:30,600 --> 03:35:31,780
Yeah, yeah.

3348
03:35:32,220 --> 03:35:33,420
Yeah, yeah.

3349
03:35:35,480 --> 03:35:36,720
Gonna grab this guy.

3350
03:35:42,160 --> 03:35:43,320
No, thank you.

3351
03:35:44,580 --> 03:35:46,000
I'm grabbing supplies.

3352
03:35:50,460 --> 03:35:52,520
Hold on, I'm just looting a little bit.

3353
03:35:53,140 --> 03:35:54,240
I don't think there is anything else.

3354
03:35:55,180 --> 03:35:55,400
Okay.

3355
03:35:59,620 --> 03:36:00,380
Oh my god.

3356
03:36:04,020 --> 03:36:05,060
What is that?

3357
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:08,140
Hold on, let me get him.

3358
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:09,500
Just kidding.

3359
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:13,080
What is that sound?

3360
03:36:15,840 --> 03:36:17,240
Are we sinking?

3361
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:30,380
I got his ass.

3362
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:36,000
Snake out.

3363
03:36:36,700 --> 03:36:42,900
I don't actually know what sinking... I think it means that they can just like follow you without doing anything.

3364
03:36:44,280 --> 03:36:45,460
It's kind of confusing.

3365
03:36:46,840 --> 03:36:47,400
Where?

3366
03:36:49,320 --> 03:36:49,640
Oh.

3367
03:36:51,520 --> 03:36:52,440
Oh you got him?

3368
03:36:52,580 --> 03:36:52,800
Oh.

3369
03:36:53,460 --> 03:36:54,360
Good job.

3370
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:55,940
I didn't see him up there.

3371
03:36:57,680 --> 03:36:58,480
We're going.

3372
03:36:58,620 --> 03:36:59,640
We're continuing onwards.

3373
03:37:00,900 --> 03:37:01,460
Forwards.

3374
03:37:03,900 --> 03:37:05,760
Is that another... What is that?

3375
03:37:05,840 --> 03:37:06,160
Prisoner?

3376
03:37:06,300 --> 03:37:06,440
No.

3377
03:37:07,740 --> 03:37:10,280
No you don't.

3378
03:37:11,620 --> 03:37:12,900
I'm also...

3379
03:37:17,600 --> 03:37:18,860
Oh shoot.

3380
03:37:20,560 --> 03:37:22,660
He just got... He just saw his friend.

3381
03:37:24,440 --> 03:37:25,360
Prisoner.

3382
03:37:27,620 --> 03:37:30,060
No you don't.

3383
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:32,300
Anyway.

3384
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:34,080
I got him!

3385
03:37:34,160 --> 03:37:34,440
I got him!

3386
03:37:34,460 --> 03:37:34,840
Thank you.

3387
03:37:36,240 --> 03:37:37,860
I hope I don't run out of Fultons.

3388
03:37:38,540 --> 03:37:40,540
I could do a supply thing though.

3389
03:37:41,180 --> 03:37:43,040
Increases your stamina and other stuff apparently.

3390
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:43,940
Oh fun.

3391
03:37:45,880 --> 03:37:46,360
Thanks!

3392
03:37:56,900 --> 03:37:59,580
Look at Snake shuffling him.

3393
03:38:05,620 --> 03:38:08,400
I see another... I see another prisoner in there too.

3394
03:38:10,360 --> 03:38:11,240
Did you get him?

3395
03:38:11,300 --> 03:38:11,680
Good job.

3396
03:38:13,160 --> 03:38:14,040
You're pretty good.

3397
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:16,300
I got this guy.

3398
03:38:18,280 --> 03:38:19,060
I got him.

3399
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:19,980
I got him.

3400
03:38:20,980 --> 03:38:21,860
I got him.

3401
03:38:25,580 --> 03:38:27,300
Oh there's two more prisoners!

3402
03:38:27,580 --> 03:38:28,160
Oh golly.

3403
03:38:31,480 --> 03:38:31,960
What?

3404
03:38:36,960 --> 03:38:38,640
What do you mean you're going all in?

3405
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:40,900
What do you mean by that?

3406
03:38:50,220 --> 03:38:51,460
Where did he go?

3407
03:38:51,460 --> 03:38:52,240
Mick Mick!

3408
03:38:59,940 --> 03:39:01,760
Don't sleep on him like that.

3409
03:39:04,240 --> 03:39:05,420
I'm the faster climber.

3410
03:39:08,640 --> 03:39:10,920
I hear the footsteps of a man.

3411
03:39:12,380 --> 03:39:13,380
Oh my god he's right there.

3412
03:39:13,640 --> 03:39:14,300
Holy cow.

3413
03:39:15,380 --> 03:39:16,220
We can take him down.

3414
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:17,720
CQC him!

3415
03:39:18,980 --> 03:39:19,980
Knock him out!

3416
03:39:19,980 --> 03:39:21,520
What is he saying?

3417
03:39:24,700 --> 03:39:30,030
What do you got?

3418
03:39:35,270 --> 03:39:37,950
He's got a big chip.

3419
03:39:38,790 --> 03:39:39,970
What else do you got?

3420
03:39:44,690 --> 03:39:46,350
Where were you hiding those?

3421
03:39:57,210 --> 03:39:58,490
Yeah, cower.

3422
03:39:59,230 --> 03:40:00,330
Sit and cower.

3423
03:40:12,060 --> 03:40:13,820
One moment please.

3424
03:40:14,620 --> 03:40:15,700
Let's acquire more ration.

3425
03:40:15,940 --> 03:40:17,200
Those are imperative for me.

3426
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:20,400
Yeah!

3427
03:40:20,740 --> 03:40:21,120
Snake out!

3428
03:40:21,720 --> 03:40:22,200
Snake in!

3429
03:40:22,320 --> 03:40:22,780
Snake out!

3430
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,080
We straight up took the guy's lunch.

3431
03:40:28,640 --> 03:40:30,080
Where was he hiding those?

3432
03:40:31,020 --> 03:40:34,220
Oh my gosh, do you think that when he came into work today...

3433
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:36,940
His pals were just like, whoa.

3434
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:38,520
Whoa, soldier.

3435
03:40:40,500 --> 03:40:44,320
You're not on any kind of sneaking mission with that dumpy.

3436
03:40:44,720 --> 03:40:47,200
He's just like, it's just a chip.

3437
03:40:51,540 --> 03:40:52,660
What are you packing?

3438
03:40:53,640 --> 03:40:56,100
Is that a bag of chips or are you just happy to see me?

3439
03:40:59,440 --> 03:41:01,320
Wait, isn't this another tank mission?

3440
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:10,900
He's like, I'm keeping these.

3441
03:41:11,040 --> 03:41:11,820
No one's taking them.

3442
03:41:11,980 --> 03:41:12,820
Little did he know.

3443
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:15,940
Mr. Money, look at the membership bag.

3444
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:23,480
Nevermind.

3445
03:41:23,660 --> 03:41:24,560
Oh, it's right now.

3446
03:41:24,900 --> 03:41:25,120
OK.

3447
03:41:27,140 --> 03:41:28,700
How do we want to do this?

3448
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:35,460
Oh.

3449
03:41:40,380 --> 03:41:41,420
How do I reload?

3450
03:41:41,660 --> 03:41:41,960
There we go.

3451
03:41:42,340 --> 03:41:42,740
I remember.

3452
03:41:46,100 --> 03:41:46,540
Stinky!

3453
03:41:52,460 --> 03:41:52,900
Oops.

3454
03:41:52,900 --> 03:41:54,000
Sorry, that was my fault.

3455
03:41:54,580 --> 03:41:55,320
I got him though.

3456
03:41:56,800 --> 03:41:58,200
Sorry, that was my fault.

3457
03:41:58,760 --> 03:41:59,420
That was my fault.

3458
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:02,420
I'll take them down once you do it, you know.

3459
03:42:03,080 --> 03:42:03,960
Oh my gosh.

3460
03:42:04,400 --> 03:42:06,420
Warn me when you're about to grenade.

3461
03:42:07,140 --> 03:42:07,520
Please.

3462
03:42:08,920 --> 03:42:10,580
In fact, I can't even see anything to shoot.

3463
03:42:11,340 --> 03:42:12,000
Can you see?

3464
03:42:12,340 --> 03:42:13,580
What's going on in there?

3465
03:42:13,920 --> 03:42:14,620
Are you OK?

3466
03:42:20,060 --> 03:42:22,080
What's going on in there?

3467
03:42:29,340 --> 03:42:31,660
I can't take home any of them.

3468
03:42:31,720 --> 03:42:32,700
I have no more...

3469
03:42:32,700 --> 03:42:32,980
Wait.

3470
03:42:33,520 --> 03:42:35,340
I didn't even get the supply thing.

3471
03:42:35,400 --> 03:42:36,580
I didn't even include it.

3472
03:42:36,940 --> 03:42:37,920
That's it anyway.

3473
03:42:43,320 --> 03:42:46,080
I love turning Snake into a passenger princess.

3474
03:42:49,980 --> 03:42:51,240
I shot them.

3475
03:42:51,500 --> 03:42:52,360
I shot one guy.

3476
03:42:52,560 --> 03:42:53,080
We're all good.

3477
03:42:58,870 --> 03:42:59,690
It's fine.

3478
03:42:59,850 --> 03:43:02,670
I'm doing my part.

3479
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:04,670
It's empty.

3480
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:17,010
64779647796477964779

3481
03:43:22,350 --> 03:43:26,810
I don't think you should shoot that next to the nukes.

3482
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:29,370
I think that's a poor decision.

3483
03:43:31,450 --> 03:43:33,030
Oh my god.

3484
03:43:40,210 --> 03:43:41,050
6477964779

3485
03:43:45,370 --> 03:43:47,030
There's our tank mission.

3486
03:43:48,130 --> 03:43:49,490
I thought that there was one here.

3487
03:43:57,230 --> 03:43:58,070
Wow!

3488
03:43:59,290 --> 03:44:02,510
In the next episode of Dragon Ball Z.

3489
03:44:04,890 --> 03:44:05,410
Yay!

3490
03:44:06,070 --> 03:44:06,630
Thank you!

3491
03:44:06,950 --> 03:44:08,130
Thanks for having me.

3492
03:44:08,710 --> 03:44:09,730
Thanks for showing off.

3493
03:44:12,230 --> 03:44:18,110
See, I would be that good too if I had a nice sneaking suit and all the fancy accessories.

3494
03:44:18,830 --> 03:44:19,790
You know what I'm just saying.

3495
03:44:20,930 --> 03:44:25,050
I would've also... I would've also been so great.

3496
03:44:27,110 --> 03:44:27,950
Of course.

3497
03:44:28,070 --> 03:44:28,910
Yeah, of course.

3498
03:44:30,290 --> 03:44:31,710
Sonic Eye.

3499
03:44:33,830 --> 03:44:37,350
Running around at the speed of sound.

3500
03:44:40,490 --> 03:44:41,470
OK.

3501
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:46,510
6...5...779.

3502
03:44:46,730 --> 03:44:47,770
I don't remember the rest.

3503
03:44:49,250 --> 03:44:50,910
Sonic Eye.

3504
03:44:52,250 --> 03:44:53,190
Rhinoceros.

3505
03:44:53,590 --> 03:44:54,170
Jaguar.

3506
03:44:55,210 --> 03:44:56,510
Oh, Frillshark.

3507
03:44:57,210 --> 03:44:58,450
What are you doing, buddy?

3508
03:45:02,830 --> 03:45:03,470
Bat!

3509
03:45:06,550 --> 03:45:08,630
Have you ever tried chorizo?

3510
03:45:08,990 --> 03:45:10,370
It's a Mexican sausage.

3511
03:45:11,030 --> 03:45:12,350
Good stuff, especially when you fry it.

3512
03:45:12,390 --> 03:45:13,070
I'm so hungry.

3513
03:45:13,230 --> 03:45:14,030
Don't talk about food.

3514
03:45:15,390 --> 03:45:16,030
Mute.

3515
03:45:16,790 --> 03:45:17,310
Yuck.

3516
03:45:17,790 --> 03:45:19,370
You're one smart customer.

3517
03:45:20,250 --> 03:45:20,890
Meerkat.

3518
03:45:21,770 --> 03:45:22,270
Beetle.

3519
03:45:23,090 --> 03:45:24,150
Cabbage White.

3520
03:45:25,210 --> 03:45:25,630
Starfish.

3521
03:45:26,170 --> 03:45:27,990
I could learn to like this outfit.

3522
03:45:29,170 --> 03:45:29,590
Chorizo.

3523
03:45:30,850 --> 03:45:31,270
Llama.

3524
03:45:32,550 --> 03:45:32,970
Yellowtail.

3525
03:45:33,510 --> 03:45:33,910
Bat.

3526
03:45:34,730 --> 03:45:35,250
Oh, OK.

3527
03:45:35,270 --> 03:45:35,650
That's everybody.

3528
03:45:37,970 --> 03:45:38,950
And...go to your posts!

3529
03:45:41,150 --> 03:45:41,990
The magazine!

3530
03:45:45,930 --> 03:45:48,870
Let's do some R&D stuff since I don't think I've touched it in a minute.

3531
03:45:49,030 --> 03:45:49,190
Oops.

3532
03:45:49,350 --> 03:45:49,550
Oops.

3533
03:45:49,670 --> 03:45:50,030
Oopsie.

3534
03:45:50,230 --> 03:45:50,450
Oops.

3535
03:45:50,670 --> 03:45:51,030
Oops.

3536
03:45:51,770 --> 03:45:53,830
What is this?

3537
03:45:54,230 --> 03:45:55,190
Oh, this is the magazine.

3538
03:45:55,450 --> 03:45:55,790
Sorry.

3539
03:45:57,190 --> 03:45:57,830
C4?

3540
03:45:58,010 --> 03:45:59,030
We'll do that, yeah.

3541
03:46:00,450 --> 03:46:01,090
M60.

3542
03:46:02,010 --> 03:46:02,650
Why not?

3543
03:46:03,450 --> 03:46:04,410
Why not?

3544
03:46:04,470 --> 03:46:04,890
Why not?

3545
03:46:07,890 --> 03:46:09,470
Didn't I do the analyzer?

3546
03:46:09,750 --> 03:46:10,810
Oh, this is analyzer 2.

3547
03:46:11,450 --> 03:46:12,250
Sonic Eye.

3548
03:46:13,730 --> 03:46:16,110
Displays nearby sound sources and animated symbols.

3549
03:46:18,330 --> 03:46:19,830
And surround indicator.

3550
03:46:21,370 --> 03:46:23,170
Yeah, the analyzer.

3551
03:46:23,410 --> 03:46:23,870
Oh, wait.

3552
03:46:24,470 --> 03:46:26,310
I don't think I...

3553
03:46:26,310 --> 03:46:26,790
Wait.

3554
03:46:26,970 --> 03:46:27,430
Sorry.

3555
03:46:28,270 --> 03:46:31,190
Is this one...search range and speed.

3556
03:46:33,950 --> 03:46:36,670
I'm trying to decide which one I want.

3557
03:46:37,850 --> 03:46:38,990
I'll do this.

3558
03:46:40,510 --> 03:46:40,950
OK.

3559
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:42,430
Alright.

3560
03:46:43,410 --> 03:46:45,490
Who wants to fight a tank?

3561
03:46:47,490 --> 03:46:47,830
Ouch.

3562
03:46:48,430 --> 03:46:48,790
Sorry.

3563
03:46:48,790 --> 03:46:55,530
I fell on my knee in Japan and it's really bruised.

3564
03:46:56,170 --> 03:46:57,430
And I just slapped my knee.

3565
03:47:00,210 --> 03:47:00,970
Get down.

3566
03:47:00,970 --> 03:47:01,450
That's the enemy,

3567
03:47:05,150 --> 03:47:05,470
isn't it?

3568
03:47:10,410 --> 03:47:11,170
Host.

3569
03:47:14,650 --> 03:47:15,410
Create.

3570
03:47:20,830 --> 03:47:22,050
Thank you guys.

3571
03:47:22,690 --> 03:47:23,230
Thank you.

3572
03:47:23,550 --> 03:47:25,350
I almost read my own name.

3573
03:47:27,610 --> 03:47:28,250
Mobius.

3574
03:47:30,030 --> 03:47:30,810
Dull bracelet.

3575
03:47:30,970 --> 03:47:31,430
Welcome back.

3576
03:47:31,750 --> 03:47:32,550
Noble Random.

3577
03:47:32,850 --> 03:47:33,470
Thank you.

3578
03:47:34,990 --> 03:47:35,950
Mission prep.

3579
03:47:36,030 --> 03:47:38,390
I don't know how many people are trying to get in.

3580
03:47:42,330 --> 03:47:45,010
But...wait a few...

3581
03:47:45,770 --> 03:47:46,510
What's the words?

3582
03:47:46,690 --> 03:47:48,330
Wait a few...

3583
03:47:48,330 --> 03:47:55,290
If you don't mind, a few games before you join another mission.

3584
03:47:55,470 --> 03:47:58,450
Just to try and let as many people in as possible.

3585
03:47:59,930 --> 03:48:01,630
Sorry, I meant to say that earlier.

3586
03:48:03,810 --> 03:48:05,330
I fell on my knee in Japan.

3587
03:48:05,510 --> 03:48:06,210
Kaz approved.

3588
03:48:09,270 --> 03:48:10,910
Mito Kaz Phantom.

3589
03:48:18,750 --> 03:48:19,270
Yeah.

3590
03:48:21,090 --> 03:48:22,690
Why do you think I like him so much?

3591
03:48:22,770 --> 03:48:23,550
We're both weeaboos.

3592
03:48:26,210 --> 03:48:27,250
Tortilla chips.

3593
03:48:27,530 --> 03:48:28,690
Tortilla chips.

3594
03:48:29,190 --> 03:48:30,730
Wait, we have a lot of those actually.

3595
03:48:31,610 --> 03:48:32,090
Crazy.

3596
03:48:38,590 --> 03:48:39,110
Sure.

3597
03:48:39,390 --> 03:48:41,730
I really don't need all this stuff, honestly.

3598
03:48:44,150 --> 03:48:44,970
You know what?

3599
03:48:45,470 --> 03:48:46,190
It's fine.

3600
03:48:49,580 --> 03:48:51,120
Guys, I'm so sorry.

3601
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:52,740
I'm sorry!

3602
03:48:53,300 --> 03:48:53,940
I'm sorry!

3603
03:48:56,620 --> 03:48:57,340
Rejoin.

3604
03:49:02,010 --> 03:49:03,730
I'm so sorry.

3605
03:49:09,430 --> 03:49:10,230
Thank you Mito.

3606
03:49:11,050 --> 03:49:12,030
What did I do?

3607
03:49:12,570 --> 03:49:13,730
Thank you for the super chat.

3608
03:49:16,810 --> 03:49:17,530
Survival.

3609
03:49:18,450 --> 03:49:20,270
Is there anything else we can equip here?

3610
03:49:20,530 --> 03:49:21,190
Grenade.

3611
03:49:21,750 --> 03:49:22,550
Smoke grenade.

3612
03:49:22,550 --> 03:49:22,710
Grenade.

3613
03:49:26,510 --> 03:49:27,030
Supply.

3614
03:49:30,130 --> 03:49:31,170
Will this...

3615
03:49:32,370 --> 03:49:33,550
Receive ammo and items.

3616
03:49:33,670 --> 03:49:35,510
So maybe this will give me more Fultons.

3617
03:49:39,550 --> 03:49:40,070
Wait.

3618
03:49:40,430 --> 03:49:41,230
Come back in.

3619
03:49:43,950 --> 03:49:45,410
Or someone come in.

3620
03:49:46,230 --> 03:49:46,670
Come in.

3621
03:49:46,750 --> 03:49:47,270
Do you read me?

3622
03:49:52,280 --> 03:49:53,360
I've got supply too.

3623
03:49:53,460 --> 03:49:53,900
Let's go!

3624
03:49:57,180 --> 03:49:58,040
And...

3625
03:50:00,940 --> 03:50:02,580
Join.

3626
03:50:03,420 --> 03:50:05,220
That wasn't a join.

3627
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:06,460
Join!

3628
03:50:08,300 --> 03:50:09,140
Join!

3629
03:50:12,070 --> 03:50:12,930
Join!

3630
03:50:13,890 --> 03:50:14,750
Join.

3631
03:50:15,130 --> 03:50:15,210
Join.

3632
03:50:16,090 --> 03:50:16,950
OK.

3633
03:50:17,050 --> 03:50:18,050
Welcome back, Micmac.

3634
03:50:18,210 --> 03:50:18,870
Let's go!

3635
03:50:20,230 --> 03:50:21,270
Last guy disappeared.

3636
03:50:22,990 --> 03:50:24,510
You can rejoin next time.

3637
03:50:25,110 --> 03:50:26,410
Don't apologize, D.Va.

3638
03:50:26,670 --> 03:50:27,170
Survival.

3639
03:50:28,130 --> 03:50:29,170
Yeah, get all suit up.

3640
03:50:29,250 --> 03:50:29,870
Take your time.

3641
03:50:29,950 --> 03:50:30,330
You're all good.

3642
03:50:36,600 --> 03:50:38,360
Someone else said it's not fair for me to join again.

3643
03:50:38,440 --> 03:50:39,080
No, it's OK.

3644
03:50:40,680 --> 03:50:41,360
I'm sorry.

3645
03:50:43,580 --> 03:50:44,760
Micmac was in earlier too.

3646
03:50:45,300 --> 03:50:46,760
Maybe there's not so many people.

3647
03:50:56,370 --> 03:50:56,750
Chico!

3648
03:50:58,630 --> 03:50:59,790
Chico, Chico, Chico.

3649
03:51:05,540 --> 03:51:07,700
I only joined because it looked like she needed an extra.

3650
03:51:09,820 --> 03:51:14,940
I just want to play with as many people as possible because it's fun that way.

3651
03:51:16,280 --> 03:51:19,000
Oh I forgot to put on my panties.

3652
03:51:19,440 --> 03:51:21,200
The pink panties.

3653
03:51:22,180 --> 03:51:23,140
Ah man.

3654
03:51:24,280 --> 03:51:25,900
That's our tank outfit everybody.

3655
03:51:26,000 --> 03:51:26,840
That's the tank uniform.

3656
03:51:32,140 --> 03:51:34,520
Thank you so much for the Akazopa!

3657
03:51:34,740 --> 03:51:35,300
Thank you!

3658
03:51:36,620 --> 03:51:38,420
Thank you so much!

3659
03:51:39,980 --> 03:51:40,580
Thank you, thank you,

3660
03:51:43,940 --> 03:51:44,320
thank you.

3661
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:48,960
Yeah team, yeah team, yeah team, yeah team.

3662
03:51:49,020 --> 03:51:49,560
Wait, wait, wait!

3663
03:51:52,340 --> 03:51:56,140
Oh I forgot my...I forgot my camera.

3664
03:52:02,280 --> 03:52:02,840
Uh...

3665
03:52:05,080 --> 03:52:05,640
Guys...

3666
03:52:06,660 --> 03:52:08,200
I think we messed up.

3667
03:52:11,160 --> 03:52:13,840
Guys, I think we messed up.

3668
03:52:21,180 --> 03:52:22,640
Why do you have two in a row?

3669
03:52:37,160 --> 03:52:38,000
Oh my God!

3670
03:52:40,980 --> 03:52:45,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3671
03:52:45,380 --> 03:52:45,580
Oh.

3672
03:52:51,770 --> 03:52:54,090
Okay back to the law, back to the law.

3673
03:53:14,280 --> 03:53:15,140
My rations.

3674
03:53:17,620 --> 03:53:18,440
I'm attacking.

3675
03:53:22,300 --> 03:53:23,520
I'm getting my...

3676
03:53:29,700 --> 03:53:31,720
Hey you guys don't die over there, okay?

3677
03:53:32,060 --> 03:53:32,640
What are you doing?

3678
03:53:33,080 --> 03:53:34,180
Oh I'm out of...

3679
03:53:41,340 --> 03:53:43,200
Wait, hold on.

3680
03:53:44,380 --> 03:53:45,440
I'm gonna get this guy.

3681
03:53:45,840 --> 03:53:45,960
Oh.

3682
03:53:46,940 --> 03:53:47,860
I'm gonna take him home.

3683
03:53:50,440 --> 03:53:51,340
Can I take him home?

3684
03:53:51,520 --> 03:53:52,580
Oh he's dead.

3685
03:53:52,640 --> 03:53:52,980
Just kidding.

3686
03:53:54,040 --> 03:53:55,600
I should put my rations.

3687
03:54:01,260 --> 03:54:01,740
Grenade!

3688
03:54:08,140 --> 03:54:09,140
I fucked up!

3689
03:54:15,650 --> 03:54:16,630
Where did it go?

3690
03:54:17,530 --> 03:54:18,770
Is that it all the way over there?

3691
03:54:26,640 --> 03:54:27,740
Yeah I got it!

3692
03:54:31,670 --> 03:54:33,310
I didn't even notice that guy.

3693
03:54:35,210 --> 03:54:35,770
Yummy!

3694
03:54:38,750 --> 03:54:40,130
Wait I can take them home!

3695
03:54:44,220 --> 03:54:45,420
I'm taking them home.

3696
03:54:47,300 --> 03:54:48,340
Taking them home.

3697
03:54:49,860 --> 03:54:50,760
Taking them home.

3698
03:54:51,560 --> 03:54:52,200
Thank you!

3699
03:54:55,200 --> 03:54:56,960
Where did the helicopter get in here?

3700
03:54:57,160 --> 03:54:58,640
Oh that's me taking them home.

3701
03:55:03,160 --> 03:55:03,720
Okay.

3702
03:55:07,460 --> 03:55:08,640
Oh I think I missed.

3703
03:55:11,140 --> 03:55:12,580
Maybe I didn't miss.

3704
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:14,260
Maybe I'm so good!

3705
03:55:15,020 --> 03:55:16,300
Maybe I'm so good!

3706
03:55:18,780 --> 03:55:21,440
I think I...

3707
03:55:21,440 --> 03:55:22,860
I missed.

3708
03:55:41,120 --> 03:55:42,720
Where are you throwing?

3709
03:55:45,680 --> 03:55:46,860
I'm just throwing.

3710
03:55:48,940 --> 03:55:50,540
We did it everybody!

3711
03:55:54,450 --> 03:55:55,670
Oh my goodness.

3712
03:55:56,030 --> 03:55:57,130
That was so stupid.

3713
03:56:00,270 --> 03:56:01,810
That was so silly.

3714
03:56:04,390 --> 03:56:06,370
I don't think I did really anything.

3715
03:56:07,610 --> 03:56:08,310
All good though.

3716
03:56:12,450 --> 03:56:13,710
That's not so bad.

3717
03:56:16,990 --> 03:56:17,690
Yay!

3718
03:56:20,130 --> 03:56:21,290
Curry recipe!

3719
03:56:22,250 --> 03:56:23,350
Alright let's go.

3720
03:56:28,850 --> 03:56:34,510
6, 4, 7, 9, 9?

3721
03:56:36,150 --> 03:56:38,670
Was that it?

3722
03:56:38,950 --> 03:56:43,690
6, 4, 7, 9...

3723
03:56:46,490 --> 03:56:47,950
6, 4, 7, 7, 9!

3724
03:56:49,490 --> 03:56:50,470
That was close.

3725
03:56:50,950 --> 03:56:51,610
That was actually close.

3726
03:56:52,510 --> 03:56:52,950
Awesome.

3727
03:57:17,010 --> 03:57:20,070
I screamed when the train rolled on top of all of us.

3728
03:57:23,090 --> 03:57:24,710
That was so funny!

3729
03:57:25,110 --> 03:57:25,730
Thank you Jesse!

3730
03:57:31,270 --> 03:57:31,910
Maybe?

3731
03:57:32,770 --> 03:57:33,870
The Basilisk!

3732
03:57:44,850 --> 03:57:46,390
Weirder things have happened Snake.

3733
03:57:46,450 --> 03:57:46,990
I'm just saying.

3734
03:57:50,250 --> 03:57:54,650
Maybe he hasn't seen all of the freaky things that have happened so far.

3735
03:58:22,270 --> 03:58:23,190
Aww yeah!

3736
03:58:23,730 --> 03:58:24,330
Blow it up!

3737
03:58:27,590 --> 03:58:30,730
I said thank you for the Akasupa earlier, but thank you!

3738
03:58:30,870 --> 03:58:35,050
I was like mid everything so...

3739
03:58:35,050 --> 03:58:37,730
I couldn't properly thank you, but thank you so much for the Akasupa!

3740
03:58:38,270 --> 03:58:38,730
Thank you!

3741
03:58:39,990 --> 03:58:42,410
Wait, I didn't get to read the message completely either.

3742
03:58:42,410 --> 03:58:44,070
Happy to catch you midstream live!

3743
03:58:44,150 --> 03:58:45,790
Your voice and cute mannerisms keep me going!

3744
03:58:46,670 --> 03:58:47,830
Thank you!

3745
03:58:48,550 --> 03:58:50,310
I really appreciate it!

3746
03:58:51,510 --> 03:58:52,430
Thank you, thank you!

3747
03:58:52,850 --> 03:58:54,130
Mother Base!

3748
03:58:54,550 --> 03:58:55,490
You were mid.

3749
03:59:00,040 --> 03:59:01,960
Now we can trade!

3750
03:59:03,760 --> 03:59:05,760
Trade with other players.

3751
03:59:05,960 --> 03:59:06,180
Wait!

3752
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:09,620
Can I now get your...

3753
03:59:09,620 --> 03:59:10,700
Minky!

3754
03:59:12,280 --> 03:59:15,260
Can I now get your...

3755
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:17,360
Your gifts?

3756
03:59:20,400 --> 03:59:21,140
Inbox!

3757
04:00:31,180 --> 04:00:32,140
It's ok.

3758
04:00:32,540 --> 04:00:33,780
I'm not even a little sad.

3759
04:00:35,880 --> 04:00:36,480
I'm fine.

3760
04:00:37,020 --> 04:00:39,540
I'm ok.

3761
04:00:40,800 --> 04:00:41,640
I'm fine.

3762
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:46,320
I actually might...

3763
04:00:46,320 --> 04:00:48,060
stop here though.

3764
04:00:48,200 --> 04:00:53,020
We got through 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

3765
04:00:53,020 --> 04:00:53,980
7 missions.

3766
04:00:55,360 --> 04:00:56,420
Not bad.

3767
04:01:00,820 --> 04:01:02,460
Might call it here.

3768
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:09,920
Is your Xbox in the correct time and date?

3769
04:01:10,000 --> 04:01:10,160
Yeah!

3770
04:01:10,440 --> 04:01:11,980
Because it literally said...

3771
04:01:12,840 --> 04:01:14,340
3.15 earlier.

3772
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:15,200
I saw it.

3773
04:01:15,460 --> 04:01:16,300
It showed the date.

3774
04:01:18,380 --> 04:01:19,260
It said the date.

3775
04:01:19,940 --> 04:01:20,420
Thank you, Minto.

3776
04:01:21,160 --> 04:01:23,420
Letting me help you, glad to have made my part.

3777
04:01:23,460 --> 04:01:25,800
Best regards from KFP of the Romance Empire.

3778
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:27,340
Thank you, Mobius!

3779
04:01:29,020 --> 04:01:29,780
Thank you.

3780
04:01:30,620 --> 04:01:33,200
But no, it said...

3781
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:38,100
Next time though that we play, I do want to do...

3782
04:01:38,100 --> 04:01:39,320
some of the extra ops.

3783
04:01:43,900 --> 04:01:47,980
Do some of the extra ops and...

3784
04:01:52,360 --> 04:01:54,420
And then of course we'll do more missions.

3785
04:01:54,800 --> 04:01:55,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3786
04:01:57,100 --> 04:01:58,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3787
04:01:59,680 --> 04:02:02,440
Did I get all the R&D things that I wanted to do?

3788
04:02:03,460 --> 04:02:05,420
OK, those are still...I think...

3789
04:02:09,760 --> 04:02:10,120
Yeah!

3790
04:02:11,800 --> 04:02:12,980
I like that.

3791
04:02:15,260 --> 04:02:15,620
C4.

3792
04:02:17,740 --> 04:02:19,020
Oh, it did get developed.

3793
04:02:19,220 --> 04:02:19,840
OK, good, good, good.

3794
04:02:20,540 --> 04:02:21,580
Good, good, good, good, good.

3795
04:02:21,580 --> 04:02:23,000
Good, good, good, good.

3796
04:02:26,620 --> 04:02:28,680
Gonna meet best character next stream.

3797
04:02:30,540 --> 04:02:32,720
I was thinking, I was just like...

3798
04:02:32,720 --> 04:02:34,700
Oh man, we're gonna have to meet that guy.

3799
04:02:34,820 --> 04:02:36,020
It's gonna ruin my day.

3800
04:02:38,380 --> 04:02:39,520
Thanks for the stream!

3801
04:02:39,620 --> 04:02:41,040
I love you, Sabine Walker.

3802
04:02:41,280 --> 04:02:42,880
Wisps and Frontiers forever.

3803
04:02:43,160 --> 04:02:44,040
Thank you!

3804
04:02:46,080 --> 04:02:47,260
Oh, he's great.

3805
04:02:52,320 --> 04:02:54,080
That guy, what does that mean?

3806
04:02:54,180 --> 04:02:55,480
You'll just have to find out!

3807
04:02:56,060 --> 04:02:56,860
Next stream!

3808
04:02:57,440 --> 04:02:58,180
Next stream!

3809
04:02:59,120 --> 04:03:00,840
That guy is coming up!

3810
04:03:04,680 --> 04:03:06,940
No one is ready.

3811
04:03:07,600 --> 04:03:08,540
Not as bad as Naomi.

3812
04:03:11,700 --> 04:03:14,920
Yeah, Naomi is worse.

3813
04:03:15,560 --> 04:03:17,260
Who am I kidding?

3814
04:03:17,260 --> 04:03:18,800
Thank you for the stream.

3815
04:03:18,980 --> 04:03:20,920
Now, Miller, roll the ads.

3816
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:24,800
Do you like burgers?

3817
04:03:25,460 --> 04:03:26,860
Do you like hot dogs and burgers?

3818
04:03:27,580 --> 04:03:29,420

We've got espionage!

3822
04:03:38,580 --> 04:03:41,760
And...and on...and on Thursdays, we have bingo night!

3823
04:03:42,400 --> 04:03:42,960
Spank!

3824

Thank you so much for the 20k!

3825
04:03:44,200 --> 04:03:45,360
Thank you!

3826
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:46,920
Fries.

3827
04:03:47,280 --> 04:03:50,000
Well, when we get more people, we'll also have fries.

3828
04:03:50,500 --> 04:03:51,020
So join!

3829

3834
04:03:59,280 --> 04:04:01,960
Thank you so much for playing with me, guys!

3835
04:04:02,440 --> 04:04:04,460
And yeah, this is so much fun.

3836
04:04:04,840 --> 04:04:05,740
I love Peace Walker.

3837
04:04:05,920 --> 04:04:09,340
We're not even into the meat of anything yet, so...

3838
04:04:09,340 --> 04:04:12,720
The story is gonna get so good!

3839
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:15,660
We're gonna get into a lot of it next time, so...

3840
04:04:15,660 --> 04:04:17,300
Thank you for the gifted!

3841
04:04:18,180 --> 04:04:18,960
Thank you!

3842
04:04:19,380 --> 04:04:23,880
Yeah, we're gonna get into the real meat of the story next time, and all the mystery and interesting stuff.

3843
04:04:24,080 --> 04:04:28,800
But we did get to see, like, what the heck was the... Why did we hear the boss's voice?

3844
04:04:28,960 --> 04:04:31,340
And what the heck is Hatsune Miku flying around for?

3845
04:04:32,200 --> 04:04:32,600
And...

3846
04:04:32,600 --> 04:04:34,780
What are they doing with all the nukes, huh?

3847
04:04:35,900 --> 04:04:36,780
Jace, thank you!

3848
04:04:38,920 --> 04:04:42,280
Thank you for everything you do.

3849
04:04:42,400 --> 04:04:43,760
Your streams always cheer me up.

3850
04:04:43,840 --> 04:04:44,800
Thanks for the stream!

3851
04:04:44,940 --> 04:04:46,700
Thank you, Jace!

3852
04:04:48,240 --> 04:04:50,180
I hope you never change your profile picture.

3853
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:53,320
Thank you so much for the stream, Mito.

3854
04:04:53,520 --> 04:04:54,800
Have fun with friends.

3855
04:04:54,920 --> 04:04:56,160
Have a great night.

3856
04:04:56,340 --> 04:04:57,360
You too, SPM!

3857
04:04:57,440 --> 04:04:58,120
Thank you!

3858
04:04:58,240 --> 04:04:59,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3859
04:05:00,220 --> 04:05:00,680
Yeah.

3860
04:05:03,800 --> 04:05:05,740
If it is the boss, I'm gonna cry.

3861
04:05:06,240 --> 04:05:07,040
We'll have to see.

3862
04:05:07,800 --> 04:05:08,740
We killed her, though.

3863
04:05:09,800 --> 04:05:10,740
We killed her, no?

3864
04:05:11,900 --> 04:05:14,480
Do you guys like this version?

3865
04:05:15,940 --> 04:05:19,520
It's kind of funny with my socks on, but...

3866
04:05:20,760 --> 04:05:21,640
Yeah, we'll go like this.

3867
04:05:21,700 --> 04:05:22,280
You guys like?

3868
04:05:23,500 --> 04:05:24,920
It's a very sneaking suit, no?

3869
04:05:28,600 --> 04:05:33,720
I thought it went well with Metal Gear.

3870
04:05:35,480 --> 04:05:36,320
Intimidating?

3871
04:05:37,440 --> 04:05:38,320
Not intimidating.

3872
04:05:39,060 --> 04:05:39,440
Spooky.

3873
04:05:39,980 --> 04:05:40,400
Scary.

3874
04:05:41,220 --> 04:05:46,420
And then my darker hair, which looks so funny with the bandana on.

3875
04:05:49,020 --> 04:05:49,700
OK,

3876
04:05:57,840 --> 04:05:57,840
OK.

3877
04:05:57,940 --> 04:05:58,980
Otsumito, everybody!

3878
04:05:59,380 --> 04:06:00,540
Otsumito, Otsumito.

3879
04:06:00,840 --> 04:06:01,840
Otsumito, Otsumito.

3880
04:06:02,100 --> 04:06:05,260
I will see you guys next time.

3881
04:06:06,100 --> 04:06:07,400
Or whenever I see you next.

3882
04:06:09,400 --> 04:06:10,500
Bye-bye!

3883
04:06:11,140 --> 04:06:11,820
Itterasshai.

3884
04:06:12,160 --> 04:06:12,580
Bye-bye!

3885
04:06:12,720 --> 04:06:13,440
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

3886
04:06:13,920 --> 04:06:14,740
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

3887
04:06:15,360 --> 04:06:16,000
Thank you!

3888
04:06:16,660 --> 04:06:17,420
See you!

3889
04:06:17,980 --> 04:06:18,540
Bye-bye!
