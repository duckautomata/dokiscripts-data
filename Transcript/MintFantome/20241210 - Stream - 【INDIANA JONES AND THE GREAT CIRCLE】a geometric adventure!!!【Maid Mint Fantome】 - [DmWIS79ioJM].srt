1
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,240
What just happened to the game?

2
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,600
It was just up?

3
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,960
What just happened?

4
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,710
I switched scenes and it literally just went...

5
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,130
It went...it went...out of existence

6
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,310
Hold on, let me get it back up.

7
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,970
That was so weird That was weird.

8
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,590
It is also kind of a bizarre game because if I...

9
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,270
No!

10
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,290
It's not a hot dog moment!

11
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:21,910
Ashes!

12
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,110
No!

13
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,670
A huanting.

14
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:34,230
It's a Russian huant This game is kind of strange because when you have it open, you can't...

15
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,150
You know how like if you're trying to get out of a game, you can hit like the windows key?

16
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:49,910
It...it doesn't let you Once you're in the game, you're stuck in the game Alt-Tab.

17
00:03:49,990 --> 00:04:06,450
I never tried that I always forget that's a feature Only naughty people do that feature because they're like I gotta switch real fast Only naughty people do that Alt-Tab.

18
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,890
I have no fear OK, Indiana Jones.

19
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,390
Play Let's...hopefully it...

20
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,270
The title does not appear to quit properly the last time it ran Do you want to run...there is a safe mode?

21
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,430
No

22
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,170
OK, OBS

23
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,340
It quit again?

24
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,940
Oh my god

25
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm gonna become the Joker.

26
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,290
Why is it that I always have a tech issue?

27
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,710
No way.

28
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,230
I'm going to become the Joker I paid

29
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
extra $30.

30
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:16,540
Even though the game is on Game Pass, I paid the $30 To get the DLC With the open T-shirt Joker

31
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,420
Oh sorry It will change your video settings, but not your controls You know what?

32
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
Let's just say yes.

33
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,340
I'm gonna run it in safe mode Don't run it!

34
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:45,190
It changed my settings too much I can't get out of the game

35
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,810
I'm stuck in the game!

36
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,170
And I can't change the resolution.

37
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,910
Hold on Hold on.

38
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,430
I have to wait through all of this.

39
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,530
I have to wait through all of this I think Oh my gosh

40
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,100
This is...this is different No, no, wait.

41
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,240
It's giving me a different screen But before it showed Indiana Jones standing here What is going on?

42
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
What is going on?

43
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,960
Why is everything haunted?

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm supposed to be the ghost I didn't have this main menu.

45
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,160
Neither did I!

46
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,760
Neither did I.

47
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,920
OK, ALT TAB Which is...oh I think that was my...

48
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,800
Oh thank goodness.

49
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,020
OK it worked I think that was my controller.

50
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,380
Pretty sure this is a controller game.

51
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:59,800
OK Let's just adjust this here like so How are you the way that you are?

52
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
It's not me!

53
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,120
Classic Todd Howard I've never seen this menu.

54
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,900
I opened this game up like three times today you guys Never had an issue.

55
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,780
Maybe this is the...

56
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,340
Oh, controller.

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,260
Maybe this is the low safe mode This is the safe mode maybe No, this is not a hot dog moment The title screen changes depending on where you are in the game.

58
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:40,080
Not chapter wise, but literally where you ended last session I ended...nowhere Well, anyway.

59
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,660
This is a cold dog moment.

60
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Anyway Well, hopefully this works.

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,080
Hopefully it still looks good And everything.

62
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm nervous.

63
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,000
I made some changes, but hopefully it all works Anyway Anyway

64
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
Hi Mint.

65
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,520
Hi Chat.

66
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,420
First time here.

67
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,020
Hello!

68
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:17,660
Sorry you came at such a craziness time Time to whip all the bad guys Let's see the options.

69
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,860
Tutorial on Oh yeah, you guys.

70
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,900
Great circle Traveling suit.

71
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,240
What is this smirk he has?

72
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,540
But, but, but this is what I paid the money for

73
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,280
And then you can get the bullwhip or you can get the lion tamer Let's do the bullwhip.

74
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,680
I like it better Arigato!

75
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,200
Arigato!

76
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,720
Chuu!

77
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,440
Chuu!

78
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,940
I hope we still get Minto being down bad for India.

79
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,600
Stop!

80
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,840
Fortune and glory indeed

81
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:16,540
You're gonna die going after your fortune and glory What if they called him Freaky Anna Jones and he had a freaky smile and whip people I'm not gonna lie.

82
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,300
The smirk is a little much here It's kind of wild OK.

83
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,460
I'll just have the controller as it is for now What?

84
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,780
No!

85
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
This makes no sense

86
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,070
20x1080.

87
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:50,490
I think that's wrong I think that's not correct I don't think that's correct But it's fine.

88
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,630
It is what it is.

89
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,130
It's fine I did... OK.

90
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,010
You guys, I did change this Because... You know what?

91
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,110
The FPS limit...

92
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,170
Was at 1000!

93
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,650
It was all the way up!

94
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,210
Yeah, she's always like this.

95
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,650
Stop!

96
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,470
Who needs 1000 FPS?

97
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,350
So I changed it earlier.

98
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,610
I was just like that's insanity I feel like 120.

99
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,690
You know, I could do 60.

100
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,210
It really doesn't matter, but...

101
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,270
120 2000 is better.

102
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,930
We're gaming.

103
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:59,730
I'm downloading more FPS Indiana Jones maid cafe They serve you, like, your meal They like... They serve it on a whip And it goes to your table Like that Watching shirtless.

104
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,750
So when I hear Indy, where is your shirt?

105
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,950
This is levels of parasocial that are beyond...

106
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,630
Are you a fan of the movies Mint?

107
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,770
I am!

108
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,250
I love Indiana Jones!

109
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,030
I've been so excited for this game I'm ready!

110
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,130
I'm so ready to play Indiana Jones!

111
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:37,830
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited And I'm so glad because I was really excited for the game and a lot of people were like...

112
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,710
I don't know, Minto.

113
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,350
I'm not so excited for it.

114
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,050
I have low expectations That's what everybody with a low expectation sounds like And then it got all the good reviews!

115
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,250
And I was like...

116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,730
I'm so excited.

117
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,930
I love Indiana Jones.

118
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:07,490
It's like my favorite movie series And Top Gun But Top Gun is not really... I guess it's two movies.

119
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,410
I guess it's like...

120
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,810
Not a series though.

121
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,150
It's a little less, right?

122
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,150
Watch Along?

123
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,770
I actually just did an Indiana Jones Watch Along like Friday It was a members.

124
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,010
It was for members, but...

125
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,730
Time for Minky Anna Phantoms and her unsay so...moans?

132
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,210

Out of Indiana Jones?

140
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:39,190
Maybe Covenant of the Ark Though I've seen Temple of Doom most.

141
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,910
Last Crusade.

142
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,710
Last Crusade is really great Last Crusade.

143
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,770
The first and the third movie are tied probably Elquesa.

144
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,690

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,970
Oh yeah Temple of Doom guy.

149
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,970
Temple of Doom is great.

150
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,710
They are all great

151
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,270
I like... I like all of them 1, 3, 2.

152
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,730
I think 2 is definitely the... like the...

153
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,810
Gale thanks for the 5 gifted.

154
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,830
I think 2 is definitely like the weakest out of the 3 But it is not bad by any means.

155
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,230
It's just the weakest, you know

156
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,450
The movie is called Raiders of the Lost Ark.

157
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,570
Excuse me?

158
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:45,370
Fake fan How dare you say that you like Indiana Jones and yet you say the Ark and the Covenant

159
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,730
Raiders!

160
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,830

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,950
It's just thanks for the 5 gifted Wish I worked on Steam Deck.

176
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,350
It doesn't?

177
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,170
Is it too beefy?

178
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:21,310
KZ Raijin thanks for the gifted There was the newest movie called Dial of Destiny Which like... I wish also there was like some ambiance or something on this title screen Okay, it's like mixed reviews but I don't think it's nearly as bad as the Crystal Skull In fact I kind of liked how wacky they went with it But I've said this before.

179
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:29,130
If you know Metal Gear and you know Metal Gear Solid 4 Then that is basically what that movie is.

180
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,950
Missing Link thanks for the 5 gifted.

181
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,810
Thank you Dial of Destiny was so crazy.

182
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,150
It's actually so crazy But I kind of liked it.

183
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,570
I didn't mind it.

184
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:47,010
It was better than Crystal Skull It's funny because like... I love Crystal Skull.

185
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:57,390
It's very campy It's funny because I think people like forget how some aspects of Indiana Jones is You know like they were just like...

186
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:14,270
This doesn't really make sense that they would do this for Indiana Jones And I'm like... Indiana Jones has been supernatural from the very beginning Indiana Jones has been kind of crazy from the very beginning It's funny They're just like what?

187
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,090
I'm not going to spoil Dial of Destiny but they're just like what?

188
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,110
You would do that for Dial of Destiny?

189
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,830
That's so weird It's just like well... It's Indiana Jones It's Indiana Jones.

190
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,390
Supernatural Was Supernatural the main criticism of that movie?

191
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,930
I think people did not like where it went.

192
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:55,970
But I liked it And also... But I don't think it's... Like I said, I don't think it doesn't have it's criticisms Sorry, I just... I already... I talked about this like 3 days ago because of the watchalong So I feel like I'm repeating myself.

193
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,610
So if you watched the watchalong and watched me rant about this Sorry if you're having to listen to me talk about it again

194
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,330
But...

195
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,330
Isn't it science fiction in Crystal Skull?

196
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,490
I guess if you consider... I guess...

197
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,130
What?

198
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,190
Aliens are... Aliens can kind of be supernatural, right?

199
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,270
But you know, it really depends on what your definition of supernatural is, you know?

200
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,370
If you're like sci-fi or supernatural

201
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,850
You know?

202
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,880
They found the Holy Grail.

203
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:46,280
There was a man living there for 700 years Indiana Jones has always been a little wacky But we love it that way I wasn't opposed to the aliens.

204
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,760
The movie was just bad You know what?

205
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,060
That's fair enough That is fair enough.

206
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,320
I remember watching it... I think I only watched it once And I was like, you know what?

207
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:20,800
Once is enough for me I only watched one indie movie and it was Dial of Destiny so this main menu image is already peak cinema You have to watch the others I swear, Dial of Destiny is just MGS4 And honestly, it has... I feel like it's also same split between people as MGS4 So,

208
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,300
it's the best comparison Let's start the game everybody.

209
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm so excited Peru Oh, this must be where it tried to start me at Except...

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Yes, because I picked some of these, right?

211
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,080
Is that supposed to be Indiana right there?

212
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,760
No, OK.

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,560
I see.

214
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:58,720
That's a bad guy We're knocking the gun out of his hand I picked moderate before, but you can pick hard and very hard Whichever you choose But I picked moderate And then I picked moderate for the puzzles

215
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh my god, I'm Indiana Jones

216
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,900
I'm him!

217
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:29,140
Oh no Hold on Hold on, hold on I turned off...

218
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:43,020
I turned off motion blur earlier I think it turned it back on Let's see Motion blur It's also...

219
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,760
Motion blur off OK Chromatic aberration off Do I need the sharpening?

220
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,900
Probably not

221
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:13,680
Let's make it a little less crisp Film grain, OK Depth of field Depth of field which creates a sense of depth by blurring objects that are out of focus Turn off the film grain Where?

222
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,840
Oh, there it is I guess we don't need it

223
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,450
Depth of field I'm gonna turn that off too Maybe

224
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,350
Let's see how it looks OK, back

225
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,990
Why does it look the way that it does?

226
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,890
Why is my head bobbing like that?

227
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:57,940
Oh my god OK, Andy, I'm not gonna get motion sick from this game Oh my god, the FPS is so...

228
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,040
No!

229
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,160
No way Is my computer not beefy enough?

230
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,510
Mito, why it runs so well on mine?

231
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,890
Yeah, are you also streaming?

232
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:34,570
Do you also have OBS and VTube Studio and VBridger all turned on?

233
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,710
I don't think so!

234
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:35,990
OK?

235
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,590
I don't think so!

236
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,100
Does it look good on OBS?

237
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,880
Can I see my body?

238
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,720
My body.

239
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,440
How do I punch?

240
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,320
Oh, I'm in combat mode

241
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:18,570
OK, let's jump OK, let's just keep walking Whip it, baby.

242
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,650
Whip it good

243
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,110
What do you want?

244
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,430
What do you want from me, sir?

245
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,010
He's like, why are you so slow?

246
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,750
Oh my goodness.

247
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:45,490
Oh gosh I don't know Oh, here It's my turn X Oh, X Sorry, I'm not in PlayStation

248
00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:02,910
It's like the movie

249
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,490
It's just like the movie

250
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,470
Wait, are those guys from the movie?

251
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:26,210
Is that guy on the right...oh my gosh Is that guy...

252
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,230
Is this guy going to betray us?

253
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,890
Relax

254
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,530
Is there a way to run?

255
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,310
OK, I just hold down faster I'm running.

256
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:45,490
I'm speedrunning this game right now Where do I go?

257
00:24:48,110 --> 00:25:03,510
Oh my god, oh my god Indiana Jones and the Great Frame Drop Everybody who convinced me out of getting a new graphics card I hope you are really enjoying this

258
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,010
Let's see.

259
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:30,470
I wonder if there is some stuff we can turn on or turn down Let's see, let's see, let's see It's only...it's not even on ultra.

260
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:36,050
Everything is on high I don't want to turn it down to medium.

261
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,970
It will be so ugly Try 60 FPS.

262
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,590
You know what?

263
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,470
That's a good idea too Even though I feel 120 is that sweet spot, but...

264
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,610
OK, manual

265
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,090
Oh my god, what are you saying?

266
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,270
Or 30 FPS.

267
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:01,630
No!

268
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,770
Cinematic 24

269
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,370
Stream is only 60 anyway.

270
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,810
You know what?

271
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,830
That's so true.

272
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,090
I never think about that But what about my experience?

273
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,630
You guys don't want the best for me?

274
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,430
What about my experience?

275
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,170
I'm the one having to look at it To the 120.

276
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,830
You don't care about me?

277
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:34,430
No, don't say that Let's see Note requires a game restart.

278
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,690
OK, we are not going to touch that.

279
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,150
Let's do the shadow Quality

280
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,710
Reflections off

281
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,490
Motion blur.

282
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,970
But we have no motion blur.

283
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:56,830
I don't think it will make a difference Hair quality.

284
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,170
That's important

285
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,470
Hair quality.

286
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,510
What's RT?

287
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,750
What is that?

288
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,330
I didn't see it What are you guys seeing?

289
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,550
That I'm not seeing.

290
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,850
What are you guys seeing?

291
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,270
Try turning off ray tracing.

292
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,930
Where is it?

293
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,750
I don't even see it Am I blind?

294
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,600
The advanced settings.

295
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,340
Did I miss it?

296
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,850
I don't see it Go down

297
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,150
It's off.

298
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:55,090
Oh, sun shadows It's off, you guys I got one guide.

299
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:09,270
You guys, it's literally off You need to learn how to read If you haven't updated GPU drivers yet, it might be worth doing so I have recently actually Crabby, welcome to membership.

300
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,250
Thank you.

301
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,270
Lamby, thanks for the gift.

302
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:22,030
Let's see how it is now Oh, it looks like doodoo, but that's OK It looks like an old game Is this ours?

303
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,530
There's a Bucky!

304
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,410
Oh my God

305
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:46,430
Warriors of the Clouds My journey through the ruins of the Chapoyan culture It's mine now Take their food

306
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,890
Oh boy.

307
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,670
It looks better though

308
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,350
I see ruins Yeah baby!

309
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,290
Where am I going?

310
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,630
What's this?

311
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:19,930
X It's just like the movie Three Days, Poison

312
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,890
Oh my God, it's just like the movie for real

313
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,910
Three Days!

314
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,310
Have you heard We Will Rock You, Meg and the Stallion?

315
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,110
I haven't

316
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,350
This is an original story, right?

317
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,470
It's not just the movie, huh?

318
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:00,090
Drink up Indy This guy, his eyes are bugging

319
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,830
Yummy Which way should we go?

320
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,170
Left or right?

321
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,690
No, no, no.

322
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,490
I decide, I decide I hate this guy.

323
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,210
I'm going right

324
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,900
You won't catch me following your pathways

325
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,680
Press A to vault

326
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,150
Nice What's this?

327
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,030
Oh, another place

328
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:54,570
I'm lifting the tree He's so bloodied Minto has Indy scared by Minky off bucket list

329
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:10,390
South America, 1936 We look really messed up

330
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,710
Do you want to play a social media game with us?

331
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,250
I'm playing another game.

332
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,370
I'm playing Indiana Jones

333
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,230
Computer, good luck!

334
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,940
Nice slideshow

335
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,130
Guys, I might...

336
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:08,230
I might become a PNG This guy I wonder if I should become a PNG I suddenly have health

337
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,820
I'm gonna try it.

338
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,060
I'm gonna try it.

339
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,360
Hold on Oh, how do I... OK, I'll tab Goodbye!

340
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
I'm dead!

341
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,440

Ok There's a figure from ancient times in the bottom right corner Yeah

584
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:36,740
I used to collect these jars Like obviously not the real ones, but like when I went through my Egyptian phase I had these jars I'd be like this one has brains.

585
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,960
This one has liver.

586
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,000
I don't know.

587
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,300

589
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,860

00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,220
Oh news article

591
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,730
Who's brains?

592
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,230
They were brains

593
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:13,290
I'm so old I belong in a museum for old memes You had an Egyptian phase?

594
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:13,810
I did!

595
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,310

596
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,830

Oh Brody

600
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,350
There was nothing else in here right?

601
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,030
So he didn't take anything in here.

602
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,010
He was just...

603
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,830
He was just speaking Latin in here for no reason.

604
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:18,530
Right here The Egyptians didn't put brains into canopic jars.

605
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,050
Instead threw them away thinking that the brain wasn't important Oh really?

606
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,610
I mean I guess if I were to see a brain I'd be like...

607
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:36,350
Yeah that's not worth it Mint's brain certainly isn't.

608
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:36,670

It's Shirley not me Your findings undoubtedly pique my interest and I'm glad that you are eager to help us retrieve the Upsala Scroll Of course many years have now passed since we lost ownership of it but I have reason to believe that an ancient and very dangerous cult is behind the theft from Mr. Lawrence There are rumors that one of its members owns an old castle west of Sigtuna If you have the time and opportunity,

641
00:58:49,350 --> 00:59:06,430

First rule of Rock Club.

681
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:44,780

Sorry I have to be a PNJ Maybe I should be looking in here

688

01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,360
What was the description of it?

700
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,820
Egyptian goddess.

701
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,920
Oh my gosh, there are so many places

702
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:36,670
So wait Throw cat.

703
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:37,790
What's this one?

704
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,930
From... Oh, Babylonian terracotta.

705
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,150
How am I supposed to know where it came from though?

706
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,990
Wait, Babylonian... Oh gosh, you guys, I don't know history.

707
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:59,450
I don't know geography or history And I don't know flags either

708
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,250
Iraq, so maybe this one?

709
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:19,090
Ok, cool PNJ Mint is not much flatter than 3D Mint I hope you can get your life today.

710
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,750
This is messed up.

711
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:21,690
What was this one?

712
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:23,010
Syria.

713
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:23,930
Oh gosh

714
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,510
Didn't he say...

715
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:31,710
What did he say about that?

716
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,630
Oh gosh, you guys.

717
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,450
What's this one?

718
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,930
No?

719
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,230
This one

720
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,270
Ok Is it this one?

721
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:57,290

724
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,850
Oh yeah I'm silly

725
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,660
You think... Oh, this one would make sense here, right?

726
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,800
Because there's the other statues

727
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,800
Yes And then this is...

728
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,460
This one It said Syria.

729
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,500
Where is... Oh, I forgot that this one was free Oh, that's the thing he stole

730
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,280
The lettering, Minto.

731
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,380
You're right Oh,

Astute deduction, Dr. Brody We shall go investigate Let's go Why don't you know the entire history of Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East?

736
01:06:52,100 --> 01:07:12,060
Oh god Because my AP history class was too cold It was too cold, I couldn't pay attention I think I still passed the exam though And then I became a Vtuber and forgot everything in my brain

737
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:30,800
Me and my friend would always complain, we'd be like god this classroom is freezing And he would yell at us when we brought in our blankets That's a classroom Where is our...

738
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,800

It was raining?

746
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,260
Yeah, but like...

747
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,380
This looks a little dramatic, don't you think?

748
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,140
Can I lift this?

749
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:40,700
Ok

750
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,160
Then we'll climb this like a ladder

751
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,020

752
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,940

I can't believe we are just calling this guy a giant What?

755
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:36,670
Moonwalking?

756
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,590
Look at the way he walks

757
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:49,590
Ok, but hold on Whoa!

758
01:09:50,150 --> 01:10:02,990

759
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,790
Beware the false pathways that lead to death.

760
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,330
Beware the deadly booby traps that lurk within

761
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:13,210

762
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:17,530

No!

766
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,030
Why?

767
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:33,310
Because there is the giant snake and then there is the...

768
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,330

769
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:40,710

The music is so awesome

773
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:36,690
How often does this guy, like, does this guy abandon his school?

774
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,270
Is that from Marion?

775
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:45,510
Cairo?

776
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,250
Marion?

777
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,130
I'm working on it.

778
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,070
Oh my gosh, it is!

779
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,350
For your next adventure.

780
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,810
Oh, it doesn't say.

781
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,510
This guy.

782
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:05,270
Come on.

783
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:09,250
What the hell, Indy?

784
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,190
Oh, I'm packing.

785
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,490
Only the essentials.

786
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,890
Okay, we gotta pack, you guys.

787
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:24,590
We need our gramophone record.

788
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,540
Into the thing.

789
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,080
Wait, so it said this and then... Oh, RB.

790
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,240
For our journal.

791
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:46,980
Okay.

792
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,340
Notes 7 out of 10.

793
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:53,240
Oh, we are missing a couple notes.

794
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,240
Should we go find them?

795
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,240
Our Bullwhip.

796
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,520
Siwa.

797
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,200
RT to inspect non-combat items.

798
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,100
Oh.

799
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,220
Oh, sorry Brody.

800
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,220
I didn't... I wasn't trying to punch you.

801
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,500
I'm trying to inspect you, my friend.

802
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,800
Oh, I'm so sorry Brody.

803
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:31,060
It's just when I let go of the trigger, I can't control myself.

804
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,940
I have a mean streak.

805
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,420
Oh, this is that guy's journal or the book that we got from the players.

806
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,940
Okay, we don't need that, I guess.

807
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,680
So, wait.

808
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,900
Our journal.

809
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:55,720
We need...

810
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,600
We need three more notes.

811
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,540
I'm gonna go look around just briefly.

812
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:04,440
Just a little briefly to see if we can grab them real quick.

813
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:11,440
I'm liking the lore and stuff that we're finding, you know, because it's like...

814
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:18,900
It's fun to see, you know, like the nod to the rod and things like that.

815
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,680
That's cute.

816
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,100
Didn't know that your violent meant, I'm a ghost.

817
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,780
It's in my nature.

818
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,040
Let's see if we can find it.

819
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,220
I wish I could run faster.

820
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:35,500
Oh.

821
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,100
Cool.

822
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:38,740
Let's see.

823
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,980
We're sprinting, we're sprinting.

824
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,000
Indy, I know you're in better shape than this.

825
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,220
I know you are in better shape than this.

826
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:47,660
Come on.

827
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,540
Don't go acting like you're out of breath.

828
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,100
Come on, man.

829
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,900
This is the... Okay.

830
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,020
And I did... This place confuses me, the layout.

831
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,740
Part time.

832
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,860
Okay, yeah.

833
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,460
I think we got everything in here.

834
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,780
Maybe I won't find it.

835
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,940
If I don't find it, no biggie.

836
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,540
Indy had a little too many cheeseburgers.

837
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,560
Indy, I know... Indy, you can literally... You can take the punch from a giant.

838
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,640
I know that you can run...

839
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,460
More than...

840
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,800
More than two feet?

841
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:39,900
Indiana Jones.

842
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,440
You're losing your touch, buddy.

843
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,060
I love this collection of rocks.

844
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,240
Just a bunch of rocks.

845
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,650
Maybe there... Maybe we...

846
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,870
I don't know where else to look.

847
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,950
Do you guys know?

848
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,870
Like the outlets in the wall.

849
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,220
Look on his desk.

850
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:16,420
Okay.

851
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,680
I'll just circle around...

852
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,820
My bad.

853
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,300
We went in here.

854
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,040
There was a newspaper clipping.

855
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,500
Anything else though?

856
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
Doesn't seem to be.

857
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,240
Your streams have been making my days better lately while I've been stressed.

858
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,200
Oh no, ma'am!

859
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,500
I'm sorry, you're stressed!

860
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,680
I'm too scared to listen to you read this.

861
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,860
No!

862
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,480
Don't leave!

863
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:49,840
Don't leave!

864
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,900
Punch in the direction of the head.

865
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,720
Or punch in the head...

866
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,400
Wait, huh?

867
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,980
You can't run because it's a school.

868
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,420
Oh, what's this?

869
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,950
This is my song!

870
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,130
Someone's gonna come back and they're gonna be like, this place...

871
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:41,590
Haunted.

872
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,710
The radio is on.

873
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,110
It's completely destroyed.

874
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:47,690
Haunted.

875
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:51,250
Alright.

876
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,890
I think I got everything on here too.

877
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,430
Let's go check his desk.

878
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,270
There's the pendant.

879
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,670
I don't see any notes or anything though.

880
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:04,010
Where the hell could they be?

881
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:04,970
What is this?

882
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,630
A necessary addition to the game.

883
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,910
Ha!

884
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:25,850
Why do you keep holding on to the door?

885
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:31,370
Is it because you're bracing yourself or when I accidentally punch you?

886
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:33,730
And what else did we need?

887
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,510
Um, cat mummy photograph.

888
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:38,990
Where is that?

889
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,800
Oh here.

890
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,340
It's kinda freaky.

891
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:54,790
Okay.

892
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:57,510
Alright.

893
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:05,250
What do you mean a foolhardy escapade?

894
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:07,890
What do you mean by that?

895
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,250
You were not there.

896
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:14,810
You were knocked out from the liquor you were drinking Mr. Brody.

897
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,490
Ah!

898
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,440
Your fortune and glory.

899
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:35,780
Yeah.

900
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,980
Why not?

901
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,980
Midterms.

902
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,260
Midterms.

903
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,800
We're married to our work Mr. Brody.

904
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,040
Oh my god the music is even the same.

905
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,420
From the movies.

906
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,150
I'm going to get the pizza.

907
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,150
Oh spaghetti Mr.

908
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:20,890
Brody.

909
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,410
Oh he's so cute!

910
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:31,830
Mama mia says Mr. Brody.

911
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,270
What a strange map.

912
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,070
Oh there we go!

913
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,270
Woo!

914
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,010
Stop.

915
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,230
Don't stop the plane.

916
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:48,770
He'll die.

917
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,670
Stop.

918
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,610
Stop.

919
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,030
Map transition.

920
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,010
So great.

921
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,990
Look at the kitty!

922
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,590
Castel Santangelo.

923
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,930
We're all roughed up again.

924
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,610
This is too much.

925
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:24,250
The fortress.

926
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:25,610
Oh new adventure.

927
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,770
Oh no it's fascist.

928
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,570
Do I have to be sneaky?

929
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,890
Maybe he can't tell that I'm here.

930
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,270
Sneaking mission?

931
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,030
Don't worry about it.

932
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,230
Do you think he's asleep?

933
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:00,950
Oh shoot!

934
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:01,950
I can parry?

935
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,470
Oh!

936
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:08,990
Oh I'm whipping

937
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:13,290
him?

938
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:19,770
Stay down!

939
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,290
Stay down!

940
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,870
He's not talking to me, right?

941
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,210
Ok.

942
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:35,730
Anyway.

943
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,170
Cool.

944
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:43,310
How long do you think he'll be down for?

945
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:44,670
A while, right?

946
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:46,910
What's in here?

947
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:48,650
Is this my suitcase?

948
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,470
Do I go under?

949
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:56,110
Do I go around?

950
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:57,470
He's dead?

951
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,530
No he's not!

952
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,690
Guys I think this is Metal Gear Solid!

953
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,910
Uh-oh!

954
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,630
I think I got tricked into playing...

955
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,030
Guys!

956
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,130
Uh-oh.

957
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,370
Again?

958
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,170
I didn't do this.

959
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:37,990
I didn't know.

960
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,430
Has there ever been stealth in Indiana?

961
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,370
Well there has been stealth in Indiana Jones.

962
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:44,810
Can I go through here?

963
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,070
How do I get around?

964
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,650
Do I go up?

965
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,710
I go up.

966
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,710
Find a spot to attach your whip.

967
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:05,130
I guess there.

968
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:08,590
Climbing?

969
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:13,090
Nice.

970
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,090
And up!

971
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:16,630
Over?

972
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,190
I hear someone whistling.

973
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,230
Ok, and up.

974
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,330
He is an in-game mechanic from Wolfenstein.

975
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:38,970
What items am I picking up?

976
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,610
Is there something to pick up?

977
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,450
Oh maybe that.

978
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,310
Ok.

979
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,530
Maybe I can throw it?

980
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:54,530
Oh yeah, LT.

981
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,810
I guess I want to go that way so...

982
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:08,190
Hold on!

983
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:25,660
No!

984
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,540
Oh my God.

985
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:31,320
He's got a stick.

986
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:32,420
I got my fist.

987
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:39,720
No!

988
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:40,640
He's got a shovel!

989
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:44,900
Why?

990
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,660
Who needs stealth?

991
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,940
This isn't a stealth game.

992
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,860
Who needs stealth anyway?

993
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,020
Why?

994
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,060
God!

995
01:25:58,530 --> 01:25:59,810
Oh shit!

996
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:01,830
I can be a real murderer.

997
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,320
Nice!

998
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,820
He's not bleeding.

999
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,280
It's the glass that broke, you guys.

1000
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,040
He's not bleeding.

1001
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,100
Don't worry about it, ok?

1002
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:43,830
Boop!

1003
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,920
The Vatican is concerned about the Pope's deteriorating physical condition.

1004
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,000
That's what they were talking about.

1005
01:26:58,980 --> 01:26:59,980
Is this the end of an era?

1006
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:06,780
Reports about the Supreme Pontiff's grave illness has sent tremors of uncertainty through the Holy See.

1007
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:14,980
Raising questions about the future of the church and its position as a moral authority for millions of people around the world.

1008
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:21,720
The vague statements coming from the Holy See have led to rampant speculations about the nature of the Pope's illness.

1009
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:31,440
What do I want for my weapon?

1010
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,660
We have so many options.

1011
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,760
Opens from the other side.

1012
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,800
Did that guy wake up?

1013
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,540
No way.

1014
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,300
What's this?

1015
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,100
Oh, bandage.

1016
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,120
I'll take that.

1017
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:50,760
Hell yeah.

1018
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,750
You think they stay down?

1019
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,490
I really can't tell.

1020
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,270
Here you are playing a stealth game now.

1021
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:04,150
I didn't know.

1022
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,690
I didn't know this would happen to me.

1023
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:11,710
It's fine.

1024
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:12,430
I'm really good.

1025
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,950
Oh, I'm actually about to die.

1026
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,830
I need some bandages.

1027
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,590
Wait, how do I... Oh, it was up, down.

1028
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,750
And use?

1029
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:25,130
What was use again?

1030
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,550
Shoot.

1031
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,530
What did I just do?

1032
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:36,530
No, not the apple.

1033
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:38,310
RT.

1034
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:39,250
Oh, thank you guys.

1035
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:42,810
Okay.

1036
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:49,150
Walk slowly backwards off ledges to grab them.

1037
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:54,690
Slow.

1038
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,630
Slow.

1039
01:28:58,590 --> 01:28:59,050
Where is

1040
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,860
my...

1041
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,280
There it is.

1042
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:10,840
My weapon.

1043
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:16,200
Keep the music on to avoid suspicion.

1044
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,720
We got a map.

1045
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:18,660
Let's go.

1046
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,280
Nice.

1047
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:24,700
Yes, it will.

1048
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,900
And this.

1049
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,900
Opens the rampart gate in the southwest bastion of Castel Sant'Angelo.

1050
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,000
Nice.

1051
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,670
Chapel of the Condemned.

1052
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,630
They wouldn't fight me in a church, right?

1053
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,870
It is dusty in here.

1054
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:50,930
Holy.

1055
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,650
Caruso's letter.

1056
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:59,890
The man in black has ordered us to let the black shirts into Castel Sant'Angelo.

1057
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:02,510
For now I advise you to return to the Vatican.

1058
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:05,030
My hands are tied, at least until the Pope has returned.

1059
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:08,110
I suspect he would be awfully vexed by all this.

1060
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:17,940
Nothing here.

1061
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,420
A bird took a crap on his shoe.

1062
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,390
Am I going the right way?

1063
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,050
Let's see.

1064
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:37,330
We are... supposed to get to... there?

1065
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,070
I'm guessing?

1066
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,330
Wait, am I right?

1067
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,050
Get to the inner courtyard.

1068
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,190
Oh yeah, we are so close.

1069
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:44,170
Perfect.

1070
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:53,210
Oh, it just saved for me.

1071
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:53,930
Okay, nice.

1072
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,070
Nothing here.

1073
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:04,350
Press B to crouch.

1074
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:09,730
Press RT to quietly knock out enemies with melee weapons.

1075
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:13,150
Okay, I will do that.

1076
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:33,090
Nice.

1077
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,690
That guy is going to come back, isn't he?

1078
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,510
Okay, no, he is down there.

1079
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,770
Okay, what is this?

1080
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,290
Alright, we got another weapon.

1081
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:58,490
We got him right in between the crotch.

1082
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,910
What is this one?

1083
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:08,930
What is over here?

1084
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:11,990
There is like little dots.

1085
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,030
Requires a black shirt key.

1086
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:18,890
There is like some little dots in the bottom right.

1087
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,370
I'm covering them, but I'm not quite sure what they mean.

1088
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,600
Okay, they didn't notice me.

1089
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:27,660
Okay.

1090
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,140
Okay, the other guy disappeared.

1091
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,520
Can I crawl under here?

1092
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,320
No.

1093
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,960
That kind of sucks.

1094
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,280
Oh god.

1095
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,840
Oh, weapon durability.

1096
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,380
I see.

1097
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,560
I see, I see.

1098
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,780
It's a weapon health.

1099
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,220
Okay, that makes sense.

1100
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:51,920
Thank you guys.

1101
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:54,240
I wonder...

1102
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,180
Maybe I should...

1103
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,920
If I drop this, do you think he will hear it?

1104
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,880
Yeah, I'm thinking I need to distract him and then get his butt.

1105
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:13,340
Oh?

1106
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:13,820
Or?

1107
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:21,100
Throw it?

1108
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,280
Wait.

1109
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:22,820
Whip?

1110
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,420
My whip?

1111
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,040
Why am I not standing up?

1112
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:27,860
There we go.

1113
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:29,780
Can I whip it?

1114
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:30,660
Whip it good.

1115
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:31,380
Oh.

1116
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:35,260
Oh shit!

1117
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,520
Oh, bless you.

1118
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,800
I think I need to stand up there and get it.

1119
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:58,440
Okay.

1120
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,250
Let's...

1121
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:02,380
Hold on.

1122
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:02,740
Alright.

1123
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:04,720
Let's do this.

1124
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,380
Leave me alone!

1125
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,300
Leave me alone!

1126
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:28,750
Oh, he left.

1127
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:31,110
He straight up left.

1128
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:31,550
Let's go.

1129
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,450
Come on!

1130
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:36,610
Arby!

1131
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,550
And...

1132
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,570
I'm doing something.

1133
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:41,230
I'm spinning.

1134
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:42,970
Guys, help me.

1135
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,030
I'm really dizzy.

1136
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:47,730
Indiana Jones, what am I doing?

1137
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:49,730
Indy!

1138
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,310
I'm about to run out of stamina.

1139
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,720
There we go.

1140
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,140
I'm trying to swing.

1141
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:50,220
Swing across.

1142
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,000
You guys!

1143
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,400
Lower more.

1144
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,520
You think that guy down there is going to notice me?

1145
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,640
How do I lower myself?

1146
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,200
Now that I've raised myself, you gotta be lower.

1147
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,560
You guys, I don't know how to go down.

1148
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,400
No.

1149
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:12,000
Okay, good.

1150
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:12,420
He's leaving.

1151
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:15,740
B?

1152
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,620
Oh, there's fall damage!

1153
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:20,940
No!

1154
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:23,600
No way.

1155
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:24,900
Okay.

1156
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,040
Oh, Arby.

1157
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,980
Okay, climb up.

1158
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,760
Oh, sorry.

1159
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:37,030
Bless you.

1160
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,590
Please!

1161
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,820
Okay, hold on.

1162
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,360
Let's go up a little more.

1163
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,160
There we go.

1164
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:10,520
And...

1165
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:11,480
Jump!

1166
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:15,460
Nothing.

1167
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:18,680
It was nothing.

1168
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:20,460
It was nothing.

1169
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:22,720
It was nothing.

1170
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,800
What?

1171
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,060
You guys, I don't know if I'm cut out to be...

1172
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,700
I don't know if I'm cut out for this lifestyle.

1173
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:46,540
Where the hell did that other guy come from that was up here?

1174
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,500
Where did that guy come from?

1175
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:53,660
I don't know.

1176
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,780
Wait, is he coming right now?

1177
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:57,820
No, no, no.

1178
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:58,580
Oh my god.

1179
01:37:58,700 --> 01:37:59,140
Oh my god!

1180
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,420
I'm running.

1181
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,480
That sounds weird.

1182
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,100
No, it doesn't.

1183
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:06,840
No, it doesn't.

1184
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:07,760
There's nothing weird here.

1185
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:08,820
There's nothing weird here.

1186
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,020
There's nothing weird here.

1187
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,240
Oh, shit.

1188
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,100
Okay.

1189
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,520
We're fine.

1190
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,440
I think I need that key in there though.

1191
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,160
Is this horror?

1192
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,980
Okay.

1193
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,240
Let's go see if anybody is around.

1194
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:04,110
Nice.

1195
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,350
Oh my god.

1196
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:13,550
So I'm guessing the little thing above them is how much they notice you.

1197
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,270
I'm assuming.

1198
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,050
Okay, I think he just went back upstairs.

1199
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:26,690
Oh, uh...

1200
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,060
You got a book?

1201
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,160
Oh, punch out?

1202
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,520
Wait, I can punch him out?

1203
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,500
Oh, it's a book called punch out.

1204
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,020
Wait.

1205
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,440
Restore stamina when the enemy is knocked out.

1206
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:46,900
Yeah.

1207
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,160
Sounds good to me.

1208
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:50,940
Bandage?

1209
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:51,760
I'll take that too.

1210
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,440
And I'm gonna use it right now.

1211
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,320
And I'm gonna take the key.

1212
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,000
Guard house key.

1213
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,320
Okay.

1214
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:04,980
And what is this?

1215
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:05,520
Money?

1216
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:07,540
Oh, I'm robbing them too?

1217
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,400
This is awesome.

1218
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,500
Wait, a fly swatter.

1219
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,060
Let's see.

1220
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:20,660
What is this?

1221
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:23,620
Oh, there's so many weapons we can use.

1222
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,060
Okay.

1223
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,000
Guard house.

1224
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:31,980
I see you.

1225
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:33,840
Where are we trying to go?

1226
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:35,880
Wait.

1227
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:38,680
Reach the top of the castello.

1228
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:39,100
Okay.

1229
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,980
Something else is back there?

1230
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,500
I don't think so.

1231
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,260
We have my shovel from before.

1232
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:48,560
Oh, what's this?

1233
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:49,360
Oh, document.

1234
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,000
Thank you, actually.

1235
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:50,440
You're right.

1236
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,940
Valeria's letter.

1237
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,100
Officer Acardo.

1238
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:03,280
Against my will, Father Ventura has requested that I perform an inventory of the Vatican supply of medicine and send it to you.

1239
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,180
In total, there are 304 small bottles of medicine and 157 large bottles.

1240
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:12,360
Frankly, I do not understand why you would need to know this, but it is not my place to question, Father Ventura.

1241
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,380
From the Vatican Pharmacy.

1242
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,800
From the Vatican Pharmacy.

1243
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,660
Maybe I should take my shovel.

1244
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,900
And maybe we can get that guy.

1245
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,020
I wish I could tell...

1246
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,980
This game needs...

1247
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,320
Like a...

1248
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,780
Way to peek around corners.

1249
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:39,560
Or...

1250
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,400
Oh my god, bless you.

1251
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,760
I did get a skill point.

1252
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,940
I noticed that, but...

1253
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,720
How do I... I don't know.

1254
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,760
I haven't received that tutorial yet.

1255
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,280
On how to use it.

1256
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,340
Yeah, or a radar.

1257
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,040
Exactly.

1258
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,420
You can actually hold LT.

1259
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:01,420
Oh.

1260
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:06,650
And then click left or right stick.

1261
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:11,770
You can peek.

1262
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:13,590
It showed you how to use it.

1263
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:13,930
It did?

1264
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,210
Hold LT and then one of the sticks.

1265
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:22,130
Maybe when I don't have a weapon?

1266
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:28,740
Oh.

1267
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,330
Oh my god.

1268
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,630
Click the sticks.

1269
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:39,970
Oh.

1270
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:42,890
Oh my gosh.

1271
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:44,450
Hold on, let's practice right here.

1272
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:46,550
So I... Hold LT.

1273
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:51,730
I see, I see, I see.

1274
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:06,530
I like hear someone walking and it's freaking me out.

1275
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:09,390
Oh, he's like right here.

1276
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:13,010
I think.

1277
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,520
Okay, he's left.

1278
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:29,980
Back into the fray.

1279
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:34,280
Back into the everything.

1280
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,060
Alright, there's a guy.

1281
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:37,940
I think he comes down here.

1282
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:39,160
Okay.

1283
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:40,360
Bless you.

1284
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,400
I mean not bless you.

1285
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:44,520
Where?

1286
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,830
I don't want to be Indiana Jones anymore.

1287
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:53,190
I want to be Dr. Brody.

1288
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,110
Oh, there he is.

1289
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:00,160
Do you think they will be able to see me when I peek?

1290
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:20,070
Oh, it's okay.

1291
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:21,710
We got his ass though.

1292
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:24,030
Yippee!

1293
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,390
We got him.

1294
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:27,470
Let's go.

1295
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:32,350
Yes.

1296
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,150
This thing is pretty flimsy.

1297
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:36,090
Oh my god, there's another guy.

1298
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:38,630
Holy shit.

1299
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:42,790
I'm running into here.

1300
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,330
Use the guard house key.

1301
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:47,110
Use it.

1302
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:47,770
Use it please.

1303
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:48,690
Use it please.

1304
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:49,650
Use it please.

1305
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:57,910
Nice.

1306
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,070
Bless you.

1307
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:04,790
Anyone in here?

1308
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:06,950
Anyone in here?

1309
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:07,810
What's this?

1310
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:08,990
Open.

1311
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:11,630
Money.

1312
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,590
Revolver bullets.

1313
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:16,170
Okay, check that.

1314
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:16,810
What else?

1315
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:17,870
Biscotti.

1316
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:19,870
80 euros.

1317
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,770
Press this to equip the revolver.

1318
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:24,690
I have a revolver?

1319
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,730
Since when?

1320
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:29,750
And I have food.

1321
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:32,330
Eat bread and boost health.

1322
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,590
Nice.

1323
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:40,650
Danny DeVito's letter.

1324
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:45,570
The priests have been ordered to be obedient, so keep your gun holstered and behave.

1325
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:48,690
If they give you any troubles, talk to Father Ventura.

1326
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,790
He is on our side.

1327
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:52,090
Mr. Danny DeVito.

1328
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:56,910
Danny DeVito.

1329
01:45:58,450 --> 01:46:00,090
There's so much to this game.

1330
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,810
It's kind of crazy.

1331
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,070
I got a broom.

1332
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,270
And I'm not afraid to use it.

1333
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,460
I have a statue.

1334
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,440
Why did I pick this up?

1335
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:23,920
Excuse me?

1336
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,560
The guard house key.

1337
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:35,510
Oh my god, there's so many guys around.

1338
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,670
I'm so scared of this place.

1339
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:38,970
I don't even know where the hell I am.

1340
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:43,730
Okay, we gotta go.

1341
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:47,670
Okay, I think I'm heading... Wait, no.

1342
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:48,630
I need to go...

1343
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:56,750
Am I going to the little yellow dot or the big triangle dot?

1344
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,910
You just went backwards through a shortcut.

1345
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:07,770
Oh damn.

1346
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:09,250
Okay, let's go back upstairs then.

1347
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:10,810
Grab my rake.

1348
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,560
That's a diamond, Minto.

1349
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:19,460
You're right.

1350
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,040
I look at one point.

1351
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:23,740
The circle first?

1352
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:23,980
Okay.

1353
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,020
Which maybe we're headed to.

1354
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,430
Where does he go to though?

1355
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:49,010
You think he comes over here?

1356
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,080
You think he comes over here?

1357
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:03,530
That was close.

1358
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:04,550
Good job, guys.

1359
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:14,630
Oh.

1360
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:17,450
There you go.

1361
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:19,190
Nice.

1362
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,190
Anyway.

1363
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:24,830
Wow, thanks for dropping a new weapon for me.

1364
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:32,710
Nice.

1365
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:34,970
Am I going this way?

1366
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:35,570
Oh, sorry.

1367
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:36,410
Wrong thing.

1368
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:39,050
Oh, the yellow dot!

1369
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:43,090
How do we get up?

1370
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,570
Okay, hold on.

1371
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:49,190
Climb!

1372
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,290
Climb, climb, climb!

1373
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:53,290
We made it!

1374
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:59,270
Maybe I am meant to be this... Is that other guy still down there?

1375
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,110
Yeah.

1376
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:05,110
Oh, wrong button.

1377
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:06,450
Wrong button.

1378
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:10,250
Upsy-daisy.

1379
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:15,490
It's a lot of controls to remember.

1380
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:16,830
But I'll get the hang of it.

1381
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:17,990
Eventually, probably.

1382
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:19,690
Probably.

1383
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,450
Eventually.

1384
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:22,130
Okay, it's saved!

1385
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:23,330
Wow!

1386
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:26,270
Nice view indeed, Indy.

1387
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,510
Wow, look at that.

1388
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:34,070
Okay, I'm entering.

1389
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:37,050
Breaking and entering, I think.

1390
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,450
Am I in the right location?

1391
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:43,590
Where am I?

1392
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:48,250
We have to go all the way over there!

1393
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:48,730
Okay.

1394
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:49,970
Alright, guys.

1395
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:50,790
No biggie.

1396
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:52,930
Pretty light.

1397
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,890
If I need to use my fists, I have them.

1398
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:00,590
Oh, what's here?

1399
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:02,890
How much money is that?

1400
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:06,190
Did I hear somebody?

1401
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:09,210
Did I hear somebody?

1402
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:14,110
The Vatican.

1403
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:17,750
Guitar?

1404
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:18,730
Where?

1405
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,260
Oh, there it is.

1406
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,200
They are partying.

1407
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:27,000
Wait!

1408
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:34,080
This game is kind of awesome.

1409
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,940
What if I just use my heels?

1410
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,760
And we go and swing it, baby.

1411
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,600
What?

1412
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:04,680
Why is the location... Why is it getting further and further away?

1413
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,460
Okay, no problem.

1414
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,960
Yeah, I got this.

1415
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,660
It's easy, probably.

1416
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,200
Take their bread.

1417
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,860
Let them go hungry.

1418
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:25,150
I can go out that way.

1419
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:27,790
If I go up, what's in here?

1420
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:29,090
More bottles.

1421
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:30,350
Lots of bottles around.

1422
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,910
Oh, hold LT to press.

1423
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:35,270
Oh, okay, that's lean.

1424
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:35,850
Thank you.

1425
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,330
What's through here?

1426
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:43,960
Oh, shoot.

1427
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,440
Courtyard of the Angel.

1428
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,480
I saw the guy.

1429
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:50,560
Gotta take their apple.

1430
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,400
Bless you.

1431
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,320
And I'm gonna use this.

1432
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:01,370
Nice.

1433
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:04,950
You think he'll turn around?

1434
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:11,070
What did you hear?

1435
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,450
Oh yeah, that's... Nevermind.

1436
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:13,970
Yeah, nevermind indeed.

1437
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:19,650
Oh my god, he has a dog!

1438
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:20,750
Oh, shit.

1439
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:34,620
Anyway...

1440
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,040
Oh god, the dog.

1441
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,200
Oh god, the dog.

1442
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:39,720
What's this?

1443
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,700
Oh, another thing.

1444
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:40,900
Okay.

1445
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:42,580
Let's go up.

1446
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:45,940
Bless you.

1447
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,760
We're one-hitting these guys now?

1448
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,320
I think I'm going the right way.

1449
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,520
Yeah, it's right over there.

1450
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,140
I... avoid this guy.

1451
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:07,200
Oh, there we go.

1452
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,310
Sweet dreams, fella.

1453
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:16,610
And... Oh, I got a lucky hat.

1454
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:20,410
And a new weapon.

1455
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:24,890
We're so good at this, you guys.

1456
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:28,950
Wow, lots of bandages.

1457
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:37,510
Yeah, we... Oh, and...

1458
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:38,790
Captain's key.

1459
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:41,110
That sounds important.

1460
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:42,150
Glad we got that.

1461
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:42,610
Oh no.

1462
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,730
Wait, do I... Maybe.

1463
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:45,450
Okay, hold on.

1464
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:46,130
I have an idea.

1465
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,430
What is this?

1466
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:52,810
Let's... Okay, here's how we distract.

1467
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:54,530
Maybe.

1468
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:58,330
I... Oh, I'm scared, you guys.

1469
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:00,350
I'm scared I'm gonna miss!

1470
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:02,470
Gun on the gun rack.

1471
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,190
What did you... What gun on the gun rack?

1472
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,280
What gun on the gun rack?

1473
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,020
Bless you.

1474
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,360
On the ground?

1475
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:18,880
On the wall?

1476
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,340
Where'd he go?

1477
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,640
Bless you.

1478
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,340
It's gonna... Maybe get it from...

1479
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:45,650
Not his booties.

1480
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,490
Don't kill the dog.

1481
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:50,850
The dog will kill me.

1482
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:52,730
It's a doggy dog world.

1483
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,330
Oh my god.

1484
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:07,150
I think I have to go like this.

1485
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,650
Is there a way to go around?

1486
01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:18,770
Like this?

1487
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:19,550
Watch this.

1488
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:21,870
We're gonna get this guy, don't worry.

1489
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,450
We got him.

1490
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:35,690
Don't worry about it.

1491
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:43,150
Oh my god, he almost noticed me.

1492
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:46,370
What the hell?

1493
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:47,690
Is he coming?

1494
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:49,770
He's not coming, right?

1495
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:58,710
There's lots of... Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff in this game.

1496
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:01,290
It just turned out to be a little slice of heaven.

1497
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:03,410
Today we are going to the Great Pyramids.

1498
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:04,550
Wish you were here.

1499
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:06,290
What's it look like?

1500
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:06,890
Wow.

1501
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:14,890
I'm taking like even their just like... I got a donut.

1502
01:56:16,190 --> 01:56:18,350
Like their personal items.

1503
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,010
Nothing is sacred for me.

1504
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:22,590
My sticky fingers.

1505
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:23,650
What's this?

1506
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,960
Let's go.

1507
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:35,740
Bless you.

1508
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,500
Everybody sneeze in here.

1509
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,900
I think those are bandages.

1510
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,060
I might be wrong.

1511
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,060
I was wrong.

1512
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:53,680
Okay, let's try and go downstairs.

1513
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:59,280
I don't know how to sneak past this guy, but we'll try.

1514
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:10,140
Okay, there's the guy with the dog.

1515
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:13,720
With the rifle.

1516
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:21,160
I think... I fear I must have to throw an item and then somehow sneak past.

1517
01:57:28,910 --> 01:57:30,750
Maybe that wasn't far enough.

1518
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,380
Is he gonna go?

1519
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,220
No, why?

1520
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,840
Why here?

1521
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,220
I hate my afterlife.

1522
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:59,110
Oh my god.

1523
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:03,110
I'm sorry.

1524
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:03,710
Whip crack.

1525
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:05,050
Whip, whip.

1526
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:12,790
That guy did not notice.

1527
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:13,330
Okay, cool.

1528
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:16,490
Let's go.

1529
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:17,090
Unlock!

1530
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:17,490
Unlock!

1531
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:17,790
Unlock!

1532
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:18,070
Unlock!

1533
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:23,230
Oh shoot.

1534
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:24,450
Oh shit.

1535
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,180
What just happened?

1536
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:44,930
That was such a silly dream now, wasn't it guys?

1537
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:49,970
Wasn't that like a crazy dream that happened just now?

1538
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:50,970
Whoa.

1539
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:56,630
It's like I jumped out a window and died or something.

1540
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,830
In my dream.

1541
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:06,020
This game does dream sequences too.

1542
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,320
Yeah, it's craziness.

1543
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,760
It's so... Bless you.

1544
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,260
It's so crazy.

1545
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,220
That guy sounded close.

1546
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:23,150
We're going... Yeah.

1547
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:25,570
I was going the correct way.

1548
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:30,490
I just have to find a way past these guys.

1549
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:31,750
It's his fault.

1550
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:33,830
It's this guy's fault.

1551
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:36,230
Because... What the hell?

1552
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:40,070
I threw the bottle or I threw the thing that way and then he comes towards me.

1553
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:41,790
Use the rifle?

1554
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:44,110
We're gonna awaken everybody in town.

1555
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:57,250
Throw the rifle.

1556
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,330
Maybe... Maybe like now.

1557
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:22,370
Maybe if I hide here... Actually, does he go pretty far?

1558
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:23,430
I don't know.

1559
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:25,030
Note.

1560
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,830
You left the key.

1561
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:28,090
Ok.

1562
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:28,910
That's fine.

1563
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:34,390
Alright.

1564
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:35,230
Now go.

1565
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:38,240
Ok.

1566
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:39,400
We did it.

1567
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:40,760
We did it guys.

1568
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:41,880
Easy.

1569
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:43,120
Easy.

1570
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,720
Item limit reached?

1571
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,140
What do you mean by that?

1572
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,060
I'm too good at this game.

1573
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,640
I lost my bottle.

1574
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:03,880
Where are we?

1575
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:06,240
Ok.

1576
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:08,120
We're going...

1577
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:11,880
Somewhere.

1578
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:13,400
Game?

1579
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:15,380
Give me a... Game?

1580
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,680
Game, it disappeared off the map.

1581
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,960
To loot goblin.

1582
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:24,880
No.

1583
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,000
Oh, right here.

1584
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,260
I believe.

1585
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,040
And also, some donuts.

1586
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,360
They love donuts, don't they?

1587
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:44,160
It seems.

1588
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:51,920
That's where I tried to go and I failed miserably.

1589
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:57,880
Ok, Andy.

1590
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,740
Let's use our inside voice.

1591
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,880
This is where I need to be.

1592
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,760
I think.

1593
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:16,500
Like right in front.

1594
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:17,340
Right here.

1595
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:18,840
Right here?

1596
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:25,380
Right around here.

1597
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:31,140
Yeah, I did kind of dive off on the side, but it was way cooler, wasn't it?

1598
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:32,920
It's actually pretty...

1599
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:45,270
Now I got to go find another weapon.

1600
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:54,670
There we go.

1601
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:59,370
Imagine getting whipped and then bonked in the head.

1602
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:00,970
Couldn't be mean.

1603
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:02,530
How embarrassing.

1604
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,160
I think I saw that guy.

1605
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,660
Ok.

1606
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,900
Oh, we'll change that.

1607
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:27,920
We'll change that, buddy.

1608
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:29,620
Oh

1609
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:35,880
God!

1610
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:41,280
Oh!

1611
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:50,500
We're fine.

1612
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:00,250
He was possessed.

1613
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:03,210
Anyway.

1614
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,510
Let's use this real quick.

1615
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:07,850
And then we'll grab a new one.

1616
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,970
Bandage time.

1617
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:09,530
Yeah, baby.

1618
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:11,690
And grab a new one.

1619
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:12,550
And what's this?

1620
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:18,770
Oh, I'll turn my frying pan into a drying pan.

1621
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:26,010
Who needs to carry bodies when you've got skills as good as mine?

1622
02:04:27,390 --> 02:04:28,190
Brawler!

1623
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:33,710
Is it the... Oh, books!

1624
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:34,230
Wait.

1625
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,200
Oh, I see.

1626
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,980
So this is how I am... Wait, so I don't need the money.

1627
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:47,280
I don't need to unlock it.

1628
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,960
It just automatically does it for me.

1629
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,180
It seems.

1630
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:52,120
So that's kind of nice.

1631
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:56,400
Anyway.

1632
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,820
Over this way.

1633
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,620
Anything else in here?

1634
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:02,260
Nope.

1635
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:07,080
I can't really tell how it works.

1636
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:10,040
Can't really tell.

1637
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,780
Oh, is that our guy?

1638
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:16,420
Get to Antonio.

1639
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:17,480
Are you Antonio?

1640
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,440
Are you Antonio?

1641
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,300
Are you my friend?

1642
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,040
No.

1643
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:24,660
No, you are not my friend.

1644
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:30,430
You're just a guy?

1645
02:05:31,450 --> 02:05:33,230
You're just a guy standing there?

1646
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:44,910
Really?

1647
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:56,240
He literally closed his eyes and said, I do not see.

1648
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:01,360
This game is so awesome.

1649
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:02,180
I can't.

1650
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,360
Oh, Antonio!

1651
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,320
Yes!

1652
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,860
Oh my gosh Antonio, you don't know.

1653
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:11,060
Why couldn't you give me a different entrance to come in?

1654
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:11,460
Huh man?

1655
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,100
You don't know what I've been through to get here.

1656
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,620
Oh my god.

1657
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:23,340
I just saw Father Ventura with a black shirt on his way to the Castello.

1658
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,440
Father Ventura?

1659
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,160
What's that?

1660
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,720
I said, who is Father Ventura?

1661
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,540
He's got his AirPods in.

1662
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:37,500
A man in black.

1663
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,480
A friend of Mussolini.

1664
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:44,120
Practically runs the Vatican now that the Pope has taken ill.

1665
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:45,120
Oh no.

1666
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,100
We know Father Ventura.

1667
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:48,620
Indy, we read the notes.

1668
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:05,900
If the winds are favorable.

1669
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:19,260
Oh my god.

1670
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:21,460
Shameless.

1671
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,220
I'm following you Father.

1672
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:25,960
Antonio.

1673
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:30,340
Thanks Antonio.

1674
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:33,000
I'm running through.

1675
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,260
Are you coming with?

1676
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:35,740
Okay.

1677
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:36,720
Good guy.

1678
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:37,740
Good guy.

1679
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:42,310
Alright.

1680
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:47,250
Fascista.

1681
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:50,050
Ah.

1682
02:08:11,290 --> 02:08:11,930
Hey Antonio.

1683
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:15,130
I might be Indiana Jones.

1684
02:08:15,290 --> 02:08:15,730
I was going to say.

1685
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:16,790
I could use a new shirt.

1686
02:08:18,210 --> 02:08:20,010
Good gift for him.

1687
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,130
Oh my god.

1688
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:25,870
So cute.

1689
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:27,570
Nice sink.

1690
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:30,310
Grazie.

1691
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:40,090
Yeah, I stole a lot of donuts though.

1692
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:42,730
Maybe that's why I don't have much stamina anymore.

1693
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:45,810
I keep taking donuts on my journeys.

1694
02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:56,410
I don't

1695
02:08:59,790 --> 02:09:00,110
know.

1696
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:00,770
Look at him go.

1697
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:15,200
They are crazy.

1698
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:15,240
Crazy.

1699
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:23,440
Break it down in the name of the lord.

1700
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,620
Is it because of me?

1701
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,000
They know I'm here.

1702
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:32,560
Confetti?

1703
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,880
Oh, Cornetti.

1704
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:35,400
Sorry.

1705
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:36,960
Father Antonio.

1706
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:38,520
You are so cute.

1707
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:43,080
Oh no, my item...

1708
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,460
Here, hold on.

1709
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:45,200
Let's eat some food.

1710
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:58,050
Yeah, he is super tall.

1711
02:09:58,390 --> 02:09:58,950
Like a giant.

1712
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:02,350
How short are we?

1713
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:14,790
Oh.

1714
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:15,770
Oh.

1715
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:18,470
Hello sister.

1716
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:20,930
She does not see.

1717
02:10:24,230 --> 02:10:24,750
Damn it.

1718
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:29,710
There you go.

1719
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:38,150
I got a garage.

1720
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:43,690
Why did he want a cat?

1721
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:45,630
Why would the Vatican want a cat mummy?

1722
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:48,490
Yeah.

1723
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:54,630
I think Indy would eat a pita.

1724
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:58,430
Only giants?

1725
02:10:58,570 --> 02:11:00,350
We are really just calling this guy a giant.

1726
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:04,390
What?

1727
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:07,290
Who wouldn't want one?

1728
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:23,090
What?

1729
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:40,060
Okay.

1730
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,480
Oh yeah?

1731
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:45,840
Oh nice.

1732
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:54,120
Yeah.

1733
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:58,340
Oh my god.

1734
02:11:58,860 --> 02:12:00,220
My disguise robes.

1735
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:01,660
Oh yeah!

1736
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:02,840
Wait.

1737
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:05,020
What do they look like?

1738
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:08,080
Press to open the satchel and select your disguise?

1739
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:11,840
Shut up!

1740
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:14,520
What do I look like?

1741
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,640
Please, I need to know.

1742
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:18,360
I need a mirror.

1743
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:23,760
Father Ford.

1744
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:26,120
Let me see.

1745
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,140
Oh, it just looks like a suit.

1746
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,060
It does look very fancy.

1747
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:42,840
Oh Padre Ventura!

1748
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:53,700
Record scratch.

1749
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:57,600
You're here to help Antonio.

1750
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:00,520
He's going deaf, he says.

1751
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:03,760
An old war wound, I'm told.

1752
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,720
I'm just here to serve God.

1753
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,520
Aren't we all?

1754
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:10,060
Sorry that chat.

1755
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,720
You guys have become Indiana Jones.

1756
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,060
You guys are on his face.

1757
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,380
Ooh.

1758
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:31,060
Yeah, Ventura.

1759
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:36,690
Get out of here.

1760
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:38,850
Disapproving exhale.

1761
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:42,010
Mortis.

1762
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:46,830
What I am about to do has not been approved by the Vatican.

1763
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:48,730
Good luck, Indy.

1764
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:52,730
If you need me, I will be here, in my office.

1765
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:54,050
OK, thanks Antonio.

1766
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:57,010
I'm going to go snoop around the library.

1767
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:00,270
Why?

1768
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,450
I'm not going to take his record.

1769
02:14:04,210 --> 02:14:05,010
I'll see you later.

1770
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,910
A superior recording.

1771
02:14:11,110 --> 02:14:12,650
OK, what's in your closet?

1772
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:13,670
Anything else?

1773
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:13,830
No?

1774
02:14:14,690 --> 02:14:14,930
OK.

1775
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:18,570
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

1776
02:14:19,090 --> 02:14:20,030
Boop, boop, boop.

1777
02:14:20,110 --> 02:14:21,130
Hello sister.

1778
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:22,370
Oh.

1779
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:23,910
Grandma.

1780
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:27,150
Why is yours red?

1781
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:30,070
What's my next objective?

1782
02:14:33,070 --> 02:14:34,070
Circle.

1783
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:38,470
Mystery thing.

1784
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:42,030
Red is cardinals.

1785
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:42,670
Like the bird?

1786
02:14:42,670 --> 02:14:44,630
Oh yeah.

1787
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:45,330
Gosh.

1788
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:49,930
I'm real tired from doing...

1789
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:53,830
Fatherly duties.

1790
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:56,190
Oh no.

1791
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:01,130
Who are you?

1792
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:04,870
What?

1793
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:07,090
What's going on?

1794
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:08,750
Who's moaning?

1795
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:10,110
Wow, purple.

1796
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:18,010
Donation box.

1797
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:18,810
It's locked.

1798
02:15:19,190 --> 02:15:22,470
If we punch it, we might be able to get the money out.

1799
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:25,690
Requires clerical key.

1800
02:15:25,990 --> 02:15:26,110
OK.

1801
02:15:27,010 --> 02:15:30,130
Alright, so that door was our thing that we wanted.

1802
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:33,490
Vatican.

1803
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:38,010
Yes, I'm supposed to be in here.

1804
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:39,050
What is that?

1805
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:42,010
Oh, the giant's pendant fits in there!

1806
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,430
I've started calling him the giant now too.

1807
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:47,230
God dammit.

1808
02:15:47,650 --> 02:15:48,870
This guy.

1809
02:15:49,670 --> 02:15:51,490
He's like, it's all my fault.

1810
02:15:51,590 --> 02:15:52,670
I was born big.

1811
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,750
Oh god!

1812
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:02,870
You scared me Antonio!

1813
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:07,090
I thought...

1814
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:10,030
I thought you were one of the other guys.

1815
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:11,290
Oh my god.

1816
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:15,070
Explore the secret passage.

1817
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:17,210
Oh, it's dark, dark.

1818
02:16:18,490 --> 02:16:20,010
Antonio, could I have a light?

1819
02:16:26,030 --> 02:16:26,750
This will do.

1820
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:29,910
Let's go.

1821
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:31,970
Oh wait, this will do.

1822
02:16:34,550 --> 02:16:37,250
Alright Antonio, by candlelight we go.

1823
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:53,400
Did you... You sounded like you didn't know about this part of the library though.

1824
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:00,600
You look fine.

1825
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:04,820
His mouth is moving.

1826
02:17:10,330 --> 02:17:13,590
My hands are shaking and my mouth is moving.

1827
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:17,310
Raise the flame to see better.

1828
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:21,150
Father Antonio, I think you are a liar.

1829
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:25,170
Are you okay?

1830
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:30,170
I love when game AI breaks.

1831
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:31,590
It's my favorite thing ever.

1832
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:36,730
Welcome to Mambo Ship, son of a bitch.

1833
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:39,810
Watch your step Antonio!

1834
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:43,010
Antonio, watch your step!

1835
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:44,010
No, don't turn around.

1836
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:47,370
Below the library.

1837
02:17:48,390 --> 02:17:49,330
Spookiness here.

1838
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:51,990
It's all spookiness here.

1839
02:17:53,610 --> 02:17:55,610
This single candle is so powerful.

1840
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:56,790
Holy cow.

1841
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:59,650
My hands are shaking.

1842
02:18:01,050 --> 02:18:02,110
Smile emoji.

1843
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:05,290
You good?

1844
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:07,570
I'm glad we have him as company though.

1845
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:08,330
This is kind of fun.

1846
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:11,330
My game is saving and I don't know why.

1847
02:18:14,670 --> 02:18:17,590
There is so much stuff down here.

1848
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:19,090
Watch your head.

1849
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:25,490
Where are you going?

1850
02:18:26,010 --> 02:18:29,470
To figure out how to open up the gate, Antonio!

1851
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,310
I'm not dumb here, okay?

1852
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:37,430
Just a little bit.

1853
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:39,690
I'm just a little stupid, okay?

1854
02:18:44,190 --> 02:18:45,290
Oh my gosh.

1855
02:18:45,430 --> 02:18:47,850
I like how we still have our whip on our side.

1856
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:50,610
Minty sapling!

1857
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:54,470
Welcome to Mambo Ship.

1858
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,290
Thank you!

1859
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:01,350
How do we open it?

1860
02:19:03,630 --> 02:19:06,630
How do we open it?

1861
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:09,470
I don't see... There is no like prompts.

1862
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,210
Anything inside?

1863
02:19:14,470 --> 02:19:15,410
We swim?

1864
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:19,590
Oh god.

1865
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:21,730
There goes my candle.

1866
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:29,470
A to ascend, B to descend.

1867
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:30,930
And how do I go forward?

1868
02:19:31,350 --> 02:19:32,230
Just normal.

1869
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:35,430
That's not so bad.

1870
02:19:37,550 --> 02:19:38,010
Oh my god.

1871
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:38,690
I'm ascending!

1872
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:39,130
I'm ascending!

1873
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:43,870
I'm ascending!

1874
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:46,330
No!

1875
02:19:47,410 --> 02:19:48,150
My candle!

1876
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:51,150
I think I messed up you guys.

1877
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:56,830
Can I have your candle sir?

1878
02:19:57,250 --> 02:19:59,190
My candle is at the bottom of the ocean.

1879
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:05,770
Shut up Antonio!

1880
02:20:05,770 --> 02:20:06,630
Yeah, I knew that.

1881
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:09,450
I'm thinking about my candle.

1882
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:11,470
I think I need to go back for it.

1883
02:20:14,110 --> 02:20:15,630
Press L to swim faster.

1884
02:20:21,290 --> 02:20:22,170
Where did it go?

1885
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:32,750
It disappeared.

1886
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:34,870
Oh my god!

1887
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:35,330
Oh my god!

1888
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:40,710
It sank and literally went to the bottom of the ocean.

1889
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:41,910
Ok.

1890
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:44,490
Here we go.

1891
02:20:49,530 --> 02:20:51,350
Blind me though.

1892
02:20:54,470 --> 02:20:55,090
Orbit.

1893
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:56,890
Yike!

1894
02:20:56,890 --> 02:20:56,970
Yike!

1895
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:04,770
Oh thank you Antonio.

1896
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:06,270
I don't have it anymore.

1897
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:12,170
Laboratory.

1898
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:16,530
A curious hand carved stone object of prehistoric origins?

1899
02:21:17,190 --> 02:21:17,370
What?

1900
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:29,810
What?

1901
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:31,970
Are you...Oh this guy!

1902
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:33,090
Oh my god!

1903
02:21:33,630 --> 02:21:34,670
Holy shit!

1904
02:21:36,330 --> 02:21:38,530
There is multiple rats on him.

1905
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:41,350
It's freaky.

1906
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:44,710
Who is this poor individual?

1907
02:21:47,070 --> 02:21:49,350
I don't know who you are talking about Antonio.

1908
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:52,030
You just start...I'm just gonna start levitating.

1909
02:21:52,830 --> 02:21:53,730
From what you are writing.

1910
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:56,270
Oh.

1911
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,730
Mad scribbles.

1912
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:01,010
What day?

1913
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:01,670
Year?

1914
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:04,050
1578 perhaps.

1915
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:05,710
Time evaporates here.

1916
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:08,050
I follow the signs to this accursed place.

1917
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:13,710
At what cost Father Chris...Cresenjo...Zo...

1918
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:16,830
Yeah.

1919
02:22:18,910 --> 02:22:22,330
What's in a new is this poor individual.

1920
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:24,230
I do not.

1921
02:22:24,630 --> 02:22:24,970
Lost?

1922
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:25,930
I am lost.

1923
02:22:26,210 --> 02:22:26,970
There is no escape.

1924
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,610
My mind, rotting.

1925
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:29,850
Unreadable scribbles.

1926
02:22:30,210 --> 02:22:32,670
I conserve fuel lest the darkness consumes me.

1927
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:33,270
No!

1928
02:22:33,530 --> 02:22:36,110
I must exercise this miasma of despair.

1929
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:37,650
Unreadable scribbles.

1930
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:40,430
Whatever soul finds this.

1931
02:22:40,670 --> 02:22:41,430
Use the map.

1932
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:43,470
Find the abominable etchings.

1933
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,010
What do they herald?

1934
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:47,810
Perchance it is all for naught.

1935
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:49,170
Inkwell runs dry.

1936
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:51,030
Heavenly Father save me!

1937
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:54,190
I'll take the map.

1938
02:22:56,390 --> 02:22:57,490
It's a map.

1939
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:00,010
Cresenjo's map.

1940
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:11,430
You can bring me some photographic evidence of these inscriptions.

1941
02:23:11,830 --> 02:23:15,310
We can study them together in my office without raising suspicion.

1942
02:23:15,850 --> 02:23:17,250
Let's say I bring you some evidence.

1943
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:18,950
You got a camera I can use?

1944
02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:24,230
No, but speak to Ernesto, the old janitor in the Vatican post office.

1945
02:23:24,830 --> 02:23:28,930
I hear he has some special deals from the lost and found section.

1946
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:30,090
That doesn't seem...

1947
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:31,550
Here is a very special key.

1948
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:35,410
It will give you access to places in the Vatican only the priests are allowed.

1949
02:23:35,410 --> 02:23:36,190
It's the clerical key.

1950
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:38,510
Thank you.

1951
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:47,410
We're just gonna...

1952
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:49,510
Okay.

1953
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:54,450
Yeah, we're gonna prepare something for this guy.

1954
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:56,570
Okay.

1955
02:23:57,530 --> 02:23:58,190
Cool.

1956
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:58,930
Nice.

1957
02:24:00,170 --> 02:24:01,530
You're not gonna go up?

1958
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:03,750
Okay.

1959
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:05,590
Alright, we're going up together.

1960
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,890
Come on, buddy.

1961
02:24:08,570 --> 02:24:09,090
Antonio?

1962
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:14,700
Oh, you're really slow, Antonio.

1963
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,040
Come on, catch up.

1964
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:17,400
Keep up, buddy.

1965
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,680
Keep up, buddy.

1966
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:20,980
Alright.

1967
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:23,840
Okey-dokey.

1968
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:25,560
He's old.

1969
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:29,380
Yeah, but like...

1970
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:31,840
It's pretty bad if you can't go up a few steps.

1971
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:33,880
Oh my god, Antonio.

1972
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:35,340
Oh my god!

1973
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:42,060
Thank you, Antonio.

1974
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:57,930
You sidestepping?

1975
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:00,830
This guy looks lost.

1976
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:04,130
I think

1977
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:12,830
he's fine.

1978
02:25:13,630 --> 02:25:14,190
Probably.

1979
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:16,690
Okay.

1980
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:20,790
There's a door up there as well.

1981
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:21,770
Okay, hold on.

1982
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:23,530
Let's check out some of these places.

1983
02:25:32,670 --> 02:25:33,510
Oh, sister.

1984
02:25:35,630 --> 02:25:37,330
I got it so easily.

1985
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:38,070
There you go.

1986
02:25:45,230 --> 02:25:46,590
She won't even look at me.

1987
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,570
Oh, what's this?

1988
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:51,790
A Vatican briscola club.

1989
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:54,810
You are invited to join us for brotherly games of briscola.

1990
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:56,230
All skill levels are welcome.

1991
02:25:56,490 --> 02:25:57,950
Gambling will not be tolerated.

1992
02:26:02,990 --> 02:26:04,850
Does the key work on this?

1993
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:05,670
No, dang it.

1994
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:11,140
No gambling?

1995
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:13,620
Okay, so we got this unlocked.

1996
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,440
Before that, hold on.

1997
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:17,220
Do you think they'll tell me no running?

1998
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:21,980
Wow, my stamina really got better.

1999
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:23,680
Is it because of the fruit?

2000
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:24,440
The donuts?

2001
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:30,750
She's like, why are you heavy breathing?

2002
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:32,870
Oh, see, yeah.

2003
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:34,330
This also requires the key.

2004
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:37,210
And then, I can't go through here.

2005
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:43,700
I will get that donation box up, I swear.

2006
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:46,940
Donuts make him go nuts.

2007
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:47,160
Oops.

2008
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:48,360
I did the wrong thing.

2009
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:49,060
There we go.

2010
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:50,420
Nice.

2011
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:52,720
What are you doing?

2012
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:54,760
Fixing that light?

2013
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:03,600
How many monkeys does it take to screw in a light bulb?

2014
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:04,280
Come on, lady.

2015
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:05,320
You got it.

2016
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:06,860
Okay.

2017
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:13,830
And then, this is where we came from.

2018
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:14,590
Yep, okay.

2019
02:27:15,310 --> 02:27:15,670
Cool.

2020
02:27:16,530 --> 02:27:17,710
I guess we didn't need to...

2021
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:19,770
So, we're going to the post office.

2022
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:21,450
Which is...

2023
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:23,050
Where's my map?

2024
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:24,610
I don't have one.

2025
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,590
That's fine.

2026
02:27:26,910 --> 02:27:27,670
We'll figure it out.

2027
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:28,510
We're smart.

2028
02:27:32,810 --> 02:27:34,030
Nice painting.

2029
02:27:34,890 --> 02:27:36,430
They're very nice paintings.

2030
02:27:40,410 --> 02:27:41,770
It's art, YouTube.

2031
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:43,970
It's art.

2032
02:27:44,970 --> 02:27:47,040
Look at that.

2033
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:50,780
YouTube, it's art.

2034
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,340
That's a lot of cans.

2035
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:57,900
Nice.

2036
02:27:58,480 --> 02:27:59,960
I was just talking about needing a map.

2037
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:01,880
And there we go.

2038
02:28:02,660 --> 02:28:03,700
We're going that way.

2039
02:28:03,860 --> 02:28:05,220
The Vatican post office.

2040
02:28:12,830 --> 02:28:13,350
Buongiorno.

2041
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:18,510
Hello.

2042
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:24,370
What's wrong with your face?

2043
02:28:24,370 --> 02:28:26,930
What's wrong with your face, sir?

2044
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:31,610
Buongiorno.

2045
02:28:32,850 --> 02:28:33,330
Buongiorno.

2046
02:28:33,430 --> 02:28:34,250
She looks possessed.

2047
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:36,790
Buongiorno.

2048
02:28:37,490 --> 02:28:38,890
You wouldn't hurt the father, would you?

2049
02:28:39,430 --> 02:28:40,530
Who's taking your money?

2050
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:41,890
Don't worry about it.

2051
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:43,850
The theft report?

2052
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:45,110
Oh shit, that's me.

2053
02:28:50,710 --> 02:28:51,830
It's just his acne.

2054
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:52,630
Oh no.

2055
02:28:54,610 --> 02:28:57,290
Caught the kid stealing confiscated artifacts from the dig site.

2056
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:58,390
The boy is from England.

2057
02:28:58,730 --> 02:28:59,510
Oh no.

2058
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:02,930
Says he's here with that confused professor Ventura.

2059
02:29:03,250 --> 02:29:07,010
Wait, says he's here with that confused professor Ventura kicked out from...

2060
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:10,510
Oh, the professor Ventura kicked out from the dig site.

2061
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:13,630
Locked him in the holding cell until we can figure out what to do with him.

2062
02:29:14,730 --> 02:29:15,790
Is that going to be our...

2063
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:16,610
Ah!

2064
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:32,910
What are you going to do?

2065
02:30:04,180 --> 02:30:05,720
I'm safe here.

2066
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:07,020
Guys,

2067
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:11,920
I think I need to restart.

2068
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:17,340
I think...

2069
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,240
Use your gun.

2070
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,640
There is like one on every person.

2071
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:26,600
It took me...

2072
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:28,300
I won't do it again.

2073
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:29,600
I promise.

2074
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:32,560
I'm a changed man.

2075
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:37,400
That guy came out of nowhere, I swear.

2076
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:40,280
Who was it?

2077
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:41,140
Hi.

2078
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,380
Oh god, he's possessed too.

2079
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:48,060
There is something not right with this city.

2080
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,620
I'm a changed man, I promise.

2081
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:01,040
They won't get mad at me for just looking around though, right?

2082
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:01,920
Mystery note.

2083
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,280
A ticket stub.

2084
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,900
Discounted price for members of the military and kids.

2085
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:09,840
52.

2086
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:12,180
OK.

2087
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:14,440
What's in here?

2088
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:14,880
Oh!

2089
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,820
I'm just...

2090
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:24,320
I'm just a guy.

2091
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:30,520
52, but part of it was taken off, you know.

2092
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:33,200
Bonjourno!

2093
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:37,480
Signposts allow you to quickly travel back to locations.

2094
02:31:37,660 --> 02:31:37,760
Oh!

2095
02:31:40,340 --> 02:31:41,020
Greetment.

2096
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:41,840
Greet.

2097
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,280
I'm changed.

2098
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:43,920
Hello!

2099
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:48,740
Are you the signpost, Matt?

2100
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:49,940
Do I need to talk to you?

2101
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:57,500
The numbers on the front and the back, you think?

2102
02:31:57,820 --> 02:31:58,860
I was thinking that.

2103
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:04,000
But I'm also so scared of getting caught.

2104
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:06,880
See, look, they see.

2105
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:07,520
They see me.

2106
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,380
Let's see.

2107
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:09,940
What was that?

2108
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:10,880
What was on there?

2109
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:11,640
Oh, wrong button.

2110
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:20,150
It was...

2111
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:25,290
52, 38 or 39?

2112
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:32,770
There's a little eye that appears next to you when you're visible.

2113
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:34,990
Oh, I did notice that.

2114
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:35,790
OK, I see.

2115
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:40,750
So if I steal now...

2116
02:32:49,250 --> 02:32:50,050
What was it?

2117
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:52,690
52...

2118
02:32:57,770 --> 02:33:00,530
38, unless it's the opposite way.

2119
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:07,610
Nice.

2120
02:33:15,350 --> 02:33:16,750
Bonjourno!

2121
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:24,270
Anyway...

2122
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:28,990
You have unused adventure points.

2123
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:29,590
Wait, what?

2124
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:30,350
How do I use it?

2125
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:32,270
Then RB...

2126
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:34,230
In my books.

2127
02:33:35,230 --> 02:33:36,190
Adventure points.

2128
02:33:36,350 --> 02:33:37,330
Unlock new things.

2129
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:43,310
But how do I use it?

2130
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:45,890
How do I unlock it?

2131
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:50,430
I'm so confused.

2132
02:33:51,350 --> 02:33:52,570
Press right one more time?

2133
02:33:52,570 --> 02:33:54,010
Not that, no.

2134
02:33:55,390 --> 02:33:56,730
It's the book, right?

2135
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:01,570
But it like shows things that I've...

2136
02:34:03,190 --> 02:34:04,410
Press on the D-pad.

2137
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:12,340
Oh, hello.

2138
02:34:20,090 --> 02:34:20,770
No!

2139
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:23,370
I didn't mean to!

2140
02:34:24,330 --> 02:34:25,770
No, please!

2141
02:34:28,390 --> 02:34:29,710
Oh my God.

2142
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:32,310
I was in my bed!

2143
02:34:43,890 --> 02:34:44,850
Hello.

2144
02:34:47,630 --> 02:34:49,530
I'm just chilling here.

2145
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:02,220
We're really sneaky.

2146
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,480
OK, anyway...

2147
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:11,980
I'm gonna stand over here.

2148
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:14,220
And we're gonna open my book.

2149
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:15,620
And I'm gonna press RB.

2150
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:18,360
And not have a gun.

2151
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:20,480
I can't believe...

2152
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:21,820
OK.

2153
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:23,720
Alright, lucky hat.

2154
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:26,600
I have 350 points.

2155
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:33,960
After being knocked out, Indy can pick up his fedora using X, giving him a second chance at the fight.

2156
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:36,100
Lucky hat is disabled while Indy is...

2157
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:40,520
What?

2158
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:41,660
Why are you...

2159
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:43,820
Why were you sneaking up on me like that?

2160
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:48,720
What other books you got?

2161
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:49,540
That's what we're gonna see.

2162
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,100
We got brawling books.

2163
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:52,640
Punch out.

2164
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:54,800
Restore stamina when an enemy is knocked out.

2165
02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:00,040
Deal increased damage in armed and hand-to-hand melee combat.

2166
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:01,140
That one looks good.

2167
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:03,240
That one seems good, I think.

2168
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:05,800
Um...

2169
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,020
Uh... I have to close it.

2170
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:09,260
And then reopen it.

2171
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:09,900
That's kind of weird.

2172
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:12,700
Combat.

2173
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:17,740
The last hit before an improvised weapon break deals additional damage.

2174
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,620
Yeah, the other one was just 25.

2175
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:22,720
I feel like we could do the two...

2176
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,800
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2177
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:26,240
I feel like we could do...

2178
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:26,880
I brought friends.

2179
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:32,420
Everybody...

2180
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:35,440
Everybody...

2181
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,540
I'm so sorry.

2182
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:39,860
I thought I opened up.

2183
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:43,800
I thought I opened up.

2184
02:36:53,210 --> 02:36:53,890
Buongiorno!

2185
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:56,730
I did not say that very well, did I?

2186
02:36:57,690 --> 02:36:58,230
Bless you.

2187
02:37:04,670 --> 02:37:05,430
What?

2188
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:08,890
I can't.

2189
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:13,530
I'm destined to get my ass kicked in this fucking city.

2190
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:15,730
Oh god, help me!

2191
02:37:16,230 --> 02:37:16,650
God!

2192
02:37:20,510 --> 02:37:21,330
The eye!

2193
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:22,290
It wasn't there!

2194
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:23,350
I promise you!

2195
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:27,770
I promise you it wasn't there!

2196
02:37:27,770 --> 02:37:27,930
It wasn't there!

2197
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:33,510
I am mad of god!

2198
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,820
I'm leaving.

2199
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:41,060
You know what?

2200
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,520
I don't care about the other amount.

2201
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:43,500
Okay.

2202
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,620
This button.

2203
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:46,880
This button.

2204
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,220
This button.

2205
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:49,000
Wait, no.

2206
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:49,660
This button.

2207
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:51,000
Okay, brawling.

2208
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,560
We're gonna unlock this ability.

2209
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:58,220
Okay, and we're gonna unlock this ability.

2210
02:38:00,820 --> 02:38:01,480
Nice.

2211
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:02,620
Close.

2212
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:04,180
Where are we going?

2213
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,160
We're going to the post office.

2214
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:09,040
Which is that way.

2215
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:10,200
Let's go.

2216
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:12,800
Now you're a man with god.

2217
02:38:15,740 --> 02:38:17,000
Oh, it's saving!

2218
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:19,000
Thank goodness.

2219
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,940
Steal medicine bottle.

2220
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:22,380
No.

2221
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,400
I'm not gonna steal any money.

2222
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:25,960
Hello, sir.

2223
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:28,780
Yes, move along, father.

2224
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:29,180
Okay.

2225
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:31,980
Bless you.

2226
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:33,640
Everybody is sneezing here.

2227
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,080
I think there is an epidemic here.

2228
02:38:41,110 --> 02:38:42,350
What are you doing?

2229
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:47,110
I think you need more...

2230
02:38:49,630 --> 02:38:50,590
How do you do?

2231
02:38:51,630 --> 02:38:54,170
I think you need more...

2232
02:38:54,170 --> 02:38:55,450
What am I reaching for?

2233
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:56,990
The flame?

2234
02:38:56,990 --> 02:38:58,630
I'm like...

2235
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:03,000
Christmas decorations.

2236
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:05,600
That's a big axe.

2237
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:06,560
Bless you.

2238
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:09,580
A lot of guitars.

2239
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:11,840
Yeah, there is a lot of guitars lying around.

2240
02:39:12,980 --> 02:39:13,860
What's in here?

2241
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:21,760
Yeah, okay.

2242
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:22,400
Nevermind.

2243
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,520
I'm getting out of here.

2244
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:28,180
So true.

2245
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:29,920
So true.

2246
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:31,180
So true.

2247
02:39:31,180 --> 02:39:32,380
Okay, nevermind.

2248
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:33,780
I'm gonna go investigate this tent.

2249
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:34,560
Just kidding.

2250
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:35,760
There is a guy standing right there.

2251
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:37,380
Okay.

2252
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:40,580
No, he's not.

2253
02:39:41,380 --> 02:39:42,000
Is he?

2254
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,120
No, he's not.

2255
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:45,280
The guy is over there.

2256
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:48,200
We are out of here.

2257
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:55,560
Where?

2258
02:39:58,500 --> 02:39:59,760
Oh, right here.

2259
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:03,040
What's going on?

2260
02:40:06,710 --> 02:40:08,860
I need to send my mail.

2261
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:12,320
Why is that lady so close to the wall?

2262
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,860
She looks like a ghost.

2263
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:23,700
Answer the question.

2264
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:32,500
Why is she so close?

2265
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:33,880
Where is he going?

2266
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:36,520
Okay.

2267
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:40,540
There is an incident.

2268
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:43,780
What is she doing?

2269
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:47,000
Okay, I'll check out this way.

2270
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:52,540
Medicine bottle.

2271
02:40:56,660 --> 02:40:58,020
Remedy for all.

2272
02:40:58,460 --> 02:40:59,020
Oh, nice.

2273
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:00,720
And bread?

2274
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:02,360
Oh, I can't have it.

2275
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:07,220
You think they're gonna notice if I jump up here?

2276
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:09,160
Let's try the other way first.

2277
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:11,300
You think she's going ghost?

2278
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,340
What do I do?

2279
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,460
You could try, Andy.

2280
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,040
Oh my god, she's still there.

2281
02:41:22,740 --> 02:41:23,960
The holy ghost.

2282
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:28,580
I guess we could go up here.

2283
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:30,840
Nobody sees us.

2284
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:33,020
Here we go.

2285
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:41,140
Father, grant me the strength to be sneaky up the wall and have nobody notice me.

2286
02:41:41,940 --> 02:41:42,760
Thank you.

2287
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:52,280
Buongiorno.

2288
02:41:54,980 --> 02:41:56,100
You have entered a restricted area.

2289
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:57,520
Your disguise will not keep you safe.

2290
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,800
Stay low to avoid detection.

2291
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:01,740
Are you serious?

2292
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:06,520
Climbing Ace.

2293
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:13,960
No, my disguise!

2294
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:22,990
There sure are a lot of guys around there.

2295
02:42:25,970 --> 02:42:27,870
Maybe I should have gone the other way.

2296
02:42:33,170 --> 02:42:35,110
What is this book anyway?

2297
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:37,090
Let's check it out.

2298
02:42:39,310 --> 02:42:40,230
Climbing Ace.

2299
02:42:40,390 --> 02:42:46,390
Drains less stamina, enables faster movement by using L while ledge climbing.

2300
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:55,650
Here I go.

2301
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,690
That guy doesn't notice me, right?

2302
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,510
Oh.

2303
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:12,510
Oh.

2304
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:14,470
Hey!

2305
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:15,650
Chill out!

2306
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:17,310
Chill out!

2307
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:21,070
Yeah,

2308
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:24,890
dummy.

2309
02:43:25,490 --> 02:43:28,770
Where are you going?

2310
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:37,010
Uh...

2311
02:43:38,270 --> 02:43:38,730
Uh...

2312
02:43:38,730 --> 02:43:41,530
Okay, I'll just, um... Let's just fight him with my fists.

2313
02:43:46,910 --> 02:43:49,990
And let's hide his body before the guys come back.

2314
02:43:50,490 --> 02:43:51,470
Please pick up the body.

2315
02:43:52,310 --> 02:43:52,510
Okay.

2316
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:56,510
Before those guys...

2317
02:43:58,570 --> 02:43:59,490
Oh, uh...

2318
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:00,030
You know what?

2319
02:44:00,050 --> 02:44:01,070
Let's just leave it right here.

2320
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:03,010
How do I drop him?

2321
02:44:06,190 --> 02:44:06,670
Nice.

2322
02:44:08,370 --> 02:44:08,850
Uh...

2323
02:44:08,850 --> 02:44:09,150
Okay.

2324
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,430
Where'd the dog go?

2325
02:44:15,350 --> 02:44:16,290
Is there anything here?

2326
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:16,750
Oh, a bottle.

2327
02:44:19,450 --> 02:44:20,630
I don't see it.

2328
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:21,110
Like, eyes.

2329
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,490
I don't see them.

2330
02:44:24,610 --> 02:44:24,830
Do you?

2331
02:44:27,470 --> 02:44:28,430
Oh, there they are.

2332
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:36,350
Okay.

2333
02:44:37,390 --> 02:44:38,690
The dog leaves?

2334
02:44:38,850 --> 02:44:41,590
Are those three guys or two?

2335
02:44:44,330 --> 02:44:45,890
Oh, it's four guys.

2336
02:44:45,970 --> 02:44:46,470
Oh my God.

2337
02:44:47,550 --> 02:44:49,290
Could've been five guys.

2338
02:44:55,290 --> 02:44:58,910
I thought... I can't tell if the very far back guy is a poster.

2339
02:44:59,190 --> 02:44:59,910
No, he's moving.

2340
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:01,030
He's definitely a real guy.

2341
02:45:01,950 --> 02:45:03,270
It could've been five guys!

2342
02:45:08,390 --> 02:45:09,190
Uh...

2343
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:11,350
Do you think they'll notice if I...

2344
02:45:12,190 --> 02:45:13,450
Let's just do that.

2345
02:45:15,150 --> 02:45:15,950
Where am I?

2346
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:18,590
Oh!

2347
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:22,530
Requires cellar key!

2348
02:45:23,950 --> 02:45:25,050
Dang it.

2349
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:32,680
What is the exclamation point?

2350
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:36,300
Okay.

2351
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:37,160
Okay, I'm gonna throw it.

2352
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:39,600
I'm gonna throw it nice and far.

2353
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:43,060
Oh, that's not far.

2354
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:46,520
Uh...

2355
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:48,320
Uh...

2356
02:46:07,810 --> 02:46:08,250
Wait.

2357
02:46:09,390 --> 02:46:10,770
No, I'm trying to...

2358
02:46:12,310 --> 02:46:13,790
LT... Oh my gosh, my stamina.

2359
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:14,750
Indy, please.

2360
02:46:16,530 --> 02:46:17,250
Chill out.

2361
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:18,750
I was just trying to...

2362
02:46:18,750 --> 02:46:22,850
I was trying to look... You know how you LT and then you can look.

2363
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:26,350
Oh gosh.

2364
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:27,490
They're both there.

2365
02:46:32,970 --> 02:46:33,930
I'm gonna go back.

2366
02:46:34,770 --> 02:46:37,630
And I'm gonna grab the bread.

2367
02:46:38,450 --> 02:46:40,310
What if I go around the other way, actually?

2368
02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:41,750
There was the other way.

2369
02:46:41,890 --> 02:46:42,150
You know what?

2370
02:46:42,150 --> 02:46:43,090
I don't have to go this way.

2371
02:46:44,570 --> 02:46:45,650
Time to eat some bread.

2372
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:46,050
Bread.

2373
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:48,450
Wait.

2374
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:49,210
Eat it?

2375
02:46:50,050 --> 02:46:50,910
No, don't throw it.

2376
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:51,810
Eat it.

2377
02:46:52,730 --> 02:46:53,510
There we go.

2378
02:46:53,710 --> 02:46:54,650
And grab new bread.

2379
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:57,430
Cornetto eaten.

2380
02:46:57,950 --> 02:46:59,390
I'm getting achievements for this.

2381
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:04,450
What if I like, rob them of their uniforms, you know?

2382
02:47:04,470 --> 02:47:05,350
And just walk around?

2383
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:11,960
You think I should change?

2384
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:13,800
Nice achievement.

2385
02:47:19,250 --> 02:47:22,430
I don't see any other better weapons, unfortunately.

2386
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:24,670
Oh, but we can grab a glass.

2387
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:36,870
Guys, I don't know which way is better.

2388
02:47:37,750 --> 02:47:39,690
Honestly, I have no idea.

2389
02:47:41,130 --> 02:47:43,210
Which way is the better way to go?

2390
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:54,130
What?

2391
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:12,870
Even the painter got me.

2392
02:48:13,570 --> 02:48:14,610
Even the...

2393
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:16,950
Even the normie guy...

2394
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:18,610
The normie guy got me.

2395
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:21,010
Oh my gosh.

2396
02:48:22,090 --> 02:48:23,450
There's so many people walking by.

2397
02:48:23,790 --> 02:48:25,130
They won't notice the bodies.

2398
02:48:25,890 --> 02:48:28,070
Why are there so many guys walking by?

2399
02:48:29,650 --> 02:48:30,270
Why?

2400
02:48:31,850 --> 02:48:34,150
Good thing guns weren't invented yet.

2401
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:35,010
So true.

2402
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:38,290
Time to eat...

2403
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:39,990
An apple.

2404
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:41,510
Orange.

2405
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:50,530
And I'm gonna eat the whole lemon.

2406
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:58,370
Oh, so apples and oranges and stuff replenish that stamina.

2407
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:00,070
Okay, interesting.

2408
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:12,680
Okay, we're gonna throw it nice and far.

2409
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:15,460
All the way over there.

2410
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:16,780
Throw, Indy!

2411
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:21,820
I can't... Oh my gosh, Indy.

2412
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:24,500
You're... Indy, you're too thick.

2413
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:25,460
No, Indy.

2414
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:26,260
Indy.

2415
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,120
Indy, I need you to... Indy.

2416
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:31,100
Indy, I need you to sneak through here.

2417
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,560
They won't notice me, right?

2418
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:46,650
Let's just keep walking.

2419
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:50,250
And go up the stairs.

2420
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:51,850
And go up the stairs.

2421
02:49:52,550 --> 02:49:53,290
In here.

2422
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:54,710
Clerical key.

2423
02:49:56,110 --> 02:49:57,430
And... Unlock.

2424
02:49:57,950 --> 02:49:58,290
Unlock.

2425
02:49:59,250 --> 02:50:01,030
And... Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

2426
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:02,250
Unlock.

2427
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:02,610
Unlock.

2428
02:50:02,770 --> 02:50:03,250
And inside.

2429
02:50:03,650 --> 02:50:04,650
And we're good.

2430
02:50:06,590 --> 02:50:07,250
Nice.

2431
02:50:10,790 --> 02:50:11,770
Catherine's letter.

2432
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:13,150
How?

2433
02:50:13,270 --> 02:50:15,230
Don't worry about it, okay?

2434
02:50:17,810 --> 02:50:19,950
Where is that delivery boy you promised?

2435
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:23,050
I have been waiting in the Sistine Chapel for well over an hour.

2436
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:27,370
You know how eager I am to learn more about the mad priest, Crescenzo.

2437
02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:30,610
Which makes me wonder, are you withholding something from me?

2438
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:32,270
You're holding out on me.

2439
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:35,570
I will stay here for a little while longer.

2440
02:50:35,830 --> 02:50:40,690
So unless the delivery boy has stumbled and broken his ankle, I expect him to be here forthwith.

2441
02:50:42,190 --> 02:50:44,510
I'm not the only one interested in Crescenzo.

2442
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:45,410
Crescenzo.

2443
02:50:46,370 --> 02:50:47,530
New fieldwork.

2444
02:50:47,910 --> 02:50:49,710
Alright, so the mad priest.

2445
02:50:50,530 --> 02:50:52,950
Alright, so we're finding Sister Catherine.

2446
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:01,740
I'm keeping this safe.

2447
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:07,560
Am I... It says exclamation point, but like, shouldn't I be fine in here?

2448
02:51:08,420 --> 02:51:09,520
You know, like...

2449
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:13,660
Is there something?

2450
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:18,680
Oh, requires camera.

2451
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:20,040
I need the camera!

2452
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:21,840
What do we have here?

2453
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:23,540
Yes, sir.

2454
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:24,660
Ernesto!

2455
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:29,360
Why?

2456
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:30,740
Okay, Indy.

2457
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:31,740
So creepy.

2458
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:37,180
He's just Indy.

2459
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:40,240
Some people just love the sound of their own voice.

2460
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:46,380
So he can understand Italian, but can't speak it?

2461
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:53,760
A camera?

2462
02:52:00,780 --> 02:52:01,760
Does he want my money?

2463
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:03,700
It's a good thing I've been stealing from everybody.

2464
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:05,960
Antonio is a lousy bum who cheats at cards.

2465
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:08,840
Antonio!

2466
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:11,620
You are a cheater!

2467
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:18,700
A camera obscura.

2468
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:22,920
Wow.

2469
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:24,880
Oh, mamma mia.

2470
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:31,600
How much?

2471
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:34,760
I've been stealing a lot from the guards.

2472
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:41,520
As long as it's not like 500 euros, I'll be fine, right?

2473
02:52:46,920 --> 02:52:47,640
How much?

2474
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:52,160
Tell me the price!

2475
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:54,200
Do you think it depends on how much money?

2476
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:54,880
Wow!

2477
02:52:56,880 --> 02:53:03,080
Do you think that they make it an amount based on how much you actually have?

2478
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,380
How much do I have?

2479
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:05,380
Oh, I have 600!

2480
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:07,740
Give me the money.

2481
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:08,680
I mean give me the camera.

2482
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:15,020
Damn.

2483
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:15,540
Expensive.

2484
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,700
The camera is yours.

2485
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:22,420
And tell Antonio that I still think he is a lousy cheat.

2486
02:53:23,620 --> 02:53:24,400
What is this?

2487
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:25,620
Not enough.

2488
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:27,700
Wait, I have to buy this too?

2489
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:29,800
Adventure books.

2490
02:53:30,580 --> 02:53:31,320
I'm good for now.

2491
02:53:33,320 --> 02:53:34,180
Alright, let's take a look.

2492
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:36,320
Informative guide to discovering the mysteries of the Vatican.

2493
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:40,820
How much money is that?

2494
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:50,100
Hold on!

2495
02:53:53,700 --> 02:53:55,220
L to view finder.

2496
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:56,300
I only have so much.

2497
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:58,020
Alright, cheese!

2498
02:54:06,260 --> 02:54:08,300
Am I in the frame?

2499
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:14,860
You need to look down a little bit, man.

2500
02:54:15,280 --> 02:54:16,480
Oh my god!

2501
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:17,520
Wow!

2502
02:54:21,110 --> 02:54:23,980
We got a two star in Ernesto!

2503
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:27,420
Two star in Ernesto.

2504
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:32,400
Just hold still.

2505
02:54:38,360 --> 02:54:39,860
Thank you!

2506
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:47,740
You guys scared me.

2507
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:50,300
How do I put this away?

2508
02:55:00,150 --> 02:55:01,830
How do I put it away?

2509
02:55:02,330 --> 02:55:02,750
Try B?

2510
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:06,570
I still just have a bread out.

2511
02:55:08,950 --> 02:55:10,530
I'm not doing anything suspicious.

2512
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:13,170
I dropped something.

2513
02:55:14,810 --> 02:55:15,790
So what are we doing now?

2514
02:55:17,630 --> 02:55:18,710
Photograph inscriptions.

2515
02:55:18,710 --> 02:55:19,810
Oh wow!

2516
02:55:20,610 --> 02:55:21,590
There's four of them.

2517
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:22,750
Ok.

2518
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:27,450
We are in an area that's not good.

2519
02:55:30,590 --> 02:55:32,870
Why are these guys fine?

2520
02:55:34,930 --> 02:55:36,610
These guys are fine, but not me?

2521
02:55:36,970 --> 02:55:37,630
So unfair.

2522
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:41,570
Yeah, nice.

2523
02:55:42,370 --> 02:55:44,490
Recipe for disaster.

2524
02:55:45,210 --> 02:55:45,970
Risotto?

2525
02:55:45,970 --> 02:55:49,090
Do not touch.

2526
02:55:49,630 --> 02:55:54,030
Pick some fresh chanterelles in the forest.

2527
02:55:57,090 --> 02:55:57,590
Wow!

2528
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:58,690
Lots of butter.

2529
02:55:59,910 --> 02:56:00,150
Ok.

2530
02:56:01,230 --> 02:56:02,530
You think this is legit?

2531
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:06,030
You think this is real?

2532
02:56:06,350 --> 02:56:07,330
Like you could follow this?

2533
02:56:09,310 --> 02:56:10,850
Well, you'll have to go to the forest.

2534
02:56:16,070 --> 02:56:17,350
What are you doing, madam?

2535
02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:23,510
God, you scared me.

2536
02:56:24,310 --> 02:56:24,590
Ok.

2537
02:56:24,770 --> 02:56:25,450
Not in there.

2538
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:28,210
Not in there.

2539
02:56:28,310 --> 02:56:28,570
Alright.

2540
02:56:29,230 --> 02:56:29,690
It's legit?

2541
02:56:31,010 --> 02:56:31,750
It's real?

2542
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:34,910
Why are you peeping on whoever is the neighbor?

2543
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:45,630
Are you saying I could have just gotten in through the window?

2544
02:56:47,930 --> 02:56:49,750
I guess that would have been easier.

2545
02:56:50,010 --> 02:56:52,090
Maybe I should leave through the window.

2546
02:56:59,930 --> 02:57:00,370
Cool.

2547
02:57:01,010 --> 02:57:01,930
That guy is still out.

2548
02:57:02,550 --> 02:57:02,990
Awesome.

2549
02:57:04,590 --> 02:57:07,070
Which means the guys over here are probably all still out.

2550
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:10,570
And we need to go over this way.

2551
02:57:27,610 --> 02:57:30,290
I guess they just don't mind.

2552
02:57:47,010 --> 02:57:48,930
It's right in here.

2553
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:49,610
Ok, nice.

2554
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:53,760
Wait.

2555
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:55,480
Is it?

2556
02:57:56,980 --> 02:57:58,220
On the other side?

2557
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:00,420
Are we?

2558
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:04,720
Yank.

2559
02:58:06,740 --> 02:58:08,720
Oh my gosh!

2560
02:58:09,640 --> 02:58:10,200
Wow!

2561
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:12,300
That's so cool!

2562
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:14,780
Let's eat some bread.

2563
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:17,220
And then we'll take a donut.

2564
02:58:18,520 --> 02:58:20,280
I don't want to let it reach for everything.

2565
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:21,380
Dang.

2566
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:25,060
But we can already be up here.

2567
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:29,740
I think we need to go up here.

2568
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:33,800
Oh!

2569
02:58:37,540 --> 02:58:42,680
Why are we making that noise, Indy?

2570
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:46,860
Hello, sir.

2571
02:58:47,360 --> 02:58:49,620
Do you mind if I photograph?

2572
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:53,840
Is it?

2573
02:58:54,020 --> 02:58:54,680
Where is it?

2574
02:58:59,670 --> 02:59:02,350
Oh, I think I need to go to the other side.

2575
02:59:02,730 --> 02:59:03,470
Ok, hold on.

2576
02:59:03,470 --> 02:59:05,370
Let's do this side first.

2577
02:59:06,790 --> 02:59:08,370
Let's do this side first.

2578
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:10,430
Since, you know...

2579
02:59:10,430 --> 02:59:12,170
Is there a good way to...

2580
02:59:12,170 --> 02:59:12,370
Oh.

2581
02:59:13,010 --> 02:59:13,410
R.B.

2582
02:59:14,090 --> 02:59:14,770
Alright.

2583
02:59:15,430 --> 02:59:15,790
Easy.

2584
02:59:16,290 --> 02:59:16,610
Easy.

2585
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:20,070
Ok.

2586
02:59:32,250 --> 02:59:33,270
Hello, sir.

2587
02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:36,290
In here?

2588
02:59:37,570 --> 02:59:39,550
There is something here, though.

2589
02:59:45,570 --> 02:59:46,170
Moxie?

2590
02:59:47,930 --> 02:59:49,130
It requires talk to Valerie.

2591
02:59:49,390 --> 02:59:49,550
Ok.

2592
02:59:50,070 --> 02:59:50,310
Hello!

2593
02:59:52,110 --> 02:59:53,570
Don't worry about my ankles.

2594
02:59:57,790 --> 02:59:58,170
Oh no!

2595
03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:07,350
No!

2596
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:11,250
Bastardo!

2597
03:00:13,930 --> 03:00:14,450
Cat!

2598
03:00:15,390 --> 03:00:16,190
Oh my god, cute!

2599
03:00:19,490 --> 03:00:20,850
Don't be mean!

2600
03:00:21,130 --> 03:00:22,150
I don't like her.

2601
03:00:25,370 --> 03:00:25,590
Yeah?

2602
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:33,010
Oh, I did grab one.

2603
03:00:33,210 --> 03:00:33,990
I did, actually.

2604
03:00:35,970 --> 03:00:36,370
Bastardo.

2605
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:38,510
Hey.

2606
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:39,590
Moxie.

2607
03:00:40,150 --> 03:00:40,950
Oh, not Moxie.

2608
03:00:41,130 --> 03:00:42,410
Your name is...

2609
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:46,050
Your name is Val...

2610
03:00:46,630 --> 03:00:48,050
I can't talk to her anymore.

2611
03:00:48,730 --> 03:00:50,550
It really wants me to get the Moxie.

2612
03:00:53,110 --> 03:00:54,390
Not enough medicine.

2613
03:00:54,870 --> 03:00:55,830
I see, I see.

2614
03:00:56,610 --> 03:00:57,910
So I don't talk to her.

2615
03:00:58,250 --> 03:00:59,690
I trade it for the books.

2616
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:01,110
I see, I see, I see.

2617
03:01:02,810 --> 03:01:04,250
Need more Moxie.

2618
03:01:04,890 --> 03:01:05,410
Ok.

2619
03:01:06,470 --> 03:01:09,030
I guess we do go back inside the other area.

2620
03:01:09,130 --> 03:01:10,090
That's kind of nice, then.

2621
03:01:16,710 --> 03:01:18,530
I've heard... I saw this, you guys.

2622
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:19,510
Look how cute!

2623
03:01:20,250 --> 03:01:21,930
I saw this as a thing.

2624
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:30,580
Oh my god, this cat is so cute!

2625
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:36,340
Indy, shut up.

2626
03:01:39,420 --> 03:01:43,720
You get adventurer points by photographing the cats.

2627
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:46,880
Is that not the cutest thing ever?

2628
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:47,860
This game is awesome.

2629
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:51,440
Ok, up we go.

2630
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:54,100
You get points for the cat.

2631
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:02,900
Indy, hold off the donuts, my man.

2632
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:08,680
Is there a good way to fall down this one?

2633
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:12,280
Is there an easy way for me to not break my ankles again?

2634
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:15,600
Uh oh, the crowd disappeared.

2635
03:02:16,060 --> 03:02:19,680
Oh, but the little exclamation point is not there anymore, so...

2636
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:24,320
RB, I tried that last time.

2637
03:02:30,460 --> 03:02:31,480
Grapple down.

2638
03:02:32,340 --> 03:02:34,360
I did walk backwards before, though.

2639
03:02:50,450 --> 03:02:52,410
No whip, just walk backwards.

2640
03:02:58,970 --> 03:02:59,390
Drop.

2641
03:03:01,430 --> 03:03:02,910
Oops, I did the wrong thing.

2642
03:03:04,530 --> 03:03:05,370
Drop.

2643
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:19,850
That's right.

2644
03:03:20,830 --> 03:03:22,190
Walk away.

2645
03:03:24,530 --> 03:03:31,090
Ok, everything seems to be in this area, I think, so we should be good just walking around.

2646
03:03:31,670 --> 03:03:32,630
Hot dog, indeed.

2647
03:03:33,330 --> 03:03:35,610
I love a game where you can take checkies of Vatican cats.

2648
03:03:36,630 --> 03:03:37,070
What?

2649
03:03:44,900 --> 03:03:47,020
Are you telling me I did all that for nothing?

2650
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:03,020
Are you telling me?

2651
03:04:05,880 --> 03:04:07,660
Oh my goodness, excuse me.

2652
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:09,820
It's over here, right?

2653
03:04:11,420 --> 03:04:13,000
I'll go around, I'll go around.

2654
03:04:14,980 --> 03:04:17,180
Don't want to cause any disturbance here.

2655
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:20,700
Oh my, where the hell did you come from?

2656
03:04:21,140 --> 03:04:22,600
This lady came from the walls?

2657
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:25,420
This place is so cursed.

2658
03:04:27,660 --> 03:04:28,860
Ah, here we go, here we go.

2659
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:29,860
This, right?

2660
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:35,340
Or...

2661
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:37,880
I feel like it must be this, right?

2662
03:04:38,880 --> 03:04:39,200
X.

2663
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:41,260
I don't want the paintbrush.

2664
03:04:45,210 --> 03:04:45,750
Yeah.

2665
03:04:49,870 --> 03:04:52,230
I like how much detail are in these.

2666
03:04:52,690 --> 03:04:54,470
I don't even have the max settings on.

2667
03:04:56,070 --> 03:04:58,410
I bet the game looks so good.

2668
03:04:59,570 --> 03:05:00,530
With it, you know?

2669
03:05:02,290 --> 03:05:02,850
Okie dokie.

2670
03:05:03,770 --> 03:05:06,250
She was just standing there, don't worry about her.

2671
03:05:06,250 --> 03:05:09,430
This is a nice little garden, I like it.

2672
03:05:10,770 --> 03:05:11,370
Oh.

2673
03:05:12,690 --> 03:05:13,210
A cat.

2674
03:05:23,330 --> 03:05:25,530
I don't think I got points for it though.

2675
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:26,590
No!

2676
03:05:27,410 --> 03:05:28,170
The cat!

2677
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:33,140
Can I climb?

2678
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:37,240
This is very important.

2679
03:05:40,860 --> 03:05:44,060
I want him yawning though, I want him yawning.

2680
03:05:47,460 --> 03:05:47,900
Yawn.

2681
03:05:49,060 --> 03:05:50,020
Yawn.

2682
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:53,940
I missed my cat!

2683
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:56,200
I missed my cats.

2684
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:57,600
They're in the other room.

2685
03:05:58,400 --> 03:05:59,580
Is the camera lens...

2686
03:06:00,460 --> 03:06:01,260
Nice.

2687
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,820
Goodness.

2688
03:06:09,420 --> 03:06:10,200
Ok, good.

2689
03:06:15,490 --> 03:06:16,270
Excuse me.

2690
03:06:20,560 --> 03:06:21,120
Ok.

2691
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:22,820
Go back through.

2692
03:06:28,290 --> 03:06:28,690
Yeah.

2693
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:30,610
Father.

2694
03:06:34,190 --> 03:06:34,450
Ok.

2695
03:06:37,310 --> 03:06:38,330
Like, ok.

2696
03:06:39,010 --> 03:06:40,030
Everything else is in here.

2697
03:06:40,870 --> 03:06:44,790
But we have to not get discovered by these guys over here that were sussing us out before.

2698
03:06:45,970 --> 03:06:46,530
Ok.

2699
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:48,770
Alright.

2700
03:06:49,990 --> 03:06:51,030
Strange inscriptions.

2701
03:06:54,430 --> 03:06:54,950
Here?

2702
03:07:00,450 --> 03:07:01,570
I don't see any.

2703
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:04,470
I'll take a picture anyway.

2704
03:07:04,590 --> 03:07:05,550
Oh wait, maybe down here?

2705
03:07:14,410 --> 03:07:16,130
This game looks so fun.

2706
03:07:16,230 --> 03:07:17,150
It is really fun.

2707
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:20,310
Maybe it's on another part of the...

2708
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:21,430
Oh, here, here, here, here.

2709
03:07:21,750 --> 03:07:22,310
I got it.

2710
03:07:28,300 --> 03:07:29,260
Different angle?

2711
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:31,120
Oh my god, Indy.

2712
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:34,120
You are so...

2713
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:38,880
Ok, we got the second one.

2714
03:07:42,100 --> 03:07:42,580
Alright.

2715
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:45,000
Over this side.

2716
03:07:45,380 --> 03:07:47,220
Oh, there's a question mark going on.

2717
03:07:47,780 --> 03:07:48,500
You're still alive?

2718
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:49,600
You must really like Indy.

2719
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,260
It's only been three hours?

2720
03:07:52,540 --> 03:07:53,780
Hasn't been that long.

2721
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:56,320
Alexander, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

2722
03:07:56,400 --> 03:07:57,220
Thank you!

2723
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:59,780
I saw a question mark up here.

2724
03:08:02,820 --> 03:08:03,300
Don't...

2725
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:03,880
Oh my god.

2726
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:04,860
No, no, no.

2727
03:08:05,380 --> 03:08:05,920
Oh my god.

2728
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:08,600
Don't even notice me.

2729
03:08:09,140 --> 03:08:09,580
Oh my god.

2730
03:08:11,240 --> 03:08:11,980
I think we're good.

2731
03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:16,700
Who is noticing me anyway?

2732
03:08:18,320 --> 03:08:18,800
Jeez.

2733
03:08:19,780 --> 03:08:20,580
She's nice.

2734
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:26,440
Thank you!

2735
03:08:27,880 --> 03:08:29,200
Seven months.

2736
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:30,680
Thank you.

2737
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:35,240
Is it Senpai?

2738
03:08:35,560 --> 03:08:36,360
Oh my god.

2739
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:38,400
Senpai noticed me.

2740
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:42,240
Where is this one?

2741
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:44,800
We're like right on top of...

2742
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:45,760
Oh, up there?

2743
03:08:50,580 --> 03:08:52,960
Let's get that one last maybe.

2744
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:55,240
There's also one over here.

2745
03:08:56,680 --> 03:08:57,820
How do we get to it?

2746
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:01,040
It's like the other side of the building.

2747
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:02,800
Okay, there's also...

2748
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:12,800
Can I come up there?

2749
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:16,660
Wow, this looks so great!

2750
03:09:17,460 --> 03:09:19,440
I'm gonna take a picture of it.

2751
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:21,520
To celebrate.

2752
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:26,960
This really awesome thing.

2753
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:29,520
It looks really cool.

2754
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:35,860
Where is it?

2755
03:09:38,500 --> 03:09:40,560
Is it over here that I have to climb?

2756
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:45,200
But they're all looking at me.

2757
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,680
Oh, they sometimes don't look at me.

2758
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:52,080
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

2759
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:54,240
Oh, I'm not gonna do it.

2760
03:09:54,560 --> 03:09:56,840
Once the icon goes away, I'm doing it.

2761
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:57,740
I'm doing it!

2762
03:10:02,500 --> 03:10:03,460
I'm doing it.

2763
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:05,460
Oh, right here.

2764
03:10:06,280 --> 03:10:07,020
I'm doing it.

2765
03:10:12,040 --> 03:10:13,040
I'm doing it.

2766
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:14,520
I'm doing it.

2767
03:10:16,140 --> 03:10:17,220
There we go.

2768
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:18,720
Nice.

2769
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:19,980
I'm doing it.

2770
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:21,840
Nobody is noticing me.

2771
03:10:22,440 --> 03:10:23,000
Probably.

2772
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:24,320
I think.

2773
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:26,860
Do they see me?

2774
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:27,440
No?

2775
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:27,900
Okay.

2776
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:30,180
Where do I...?

2777
03:10:30,180 --> 03:10:30,840
Oh, they're right here.

2778
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:33,240
Nobody is noticing me.

2779
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:35,560
Nobody is noticing me.

2780
03:10:38,400 --> 03:10:40,160
I'm too short.

2781
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:41,160
Uppies!

2782
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:43,000
Uppies!

2783
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:44,600
Okay, there we go.

2784
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:45,920
I'm doing it.

2785
03:10:46,380 --> 03:10:47,460
I'm doing it.

2786
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:50,420
I'm doing it.

2787
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,460
Oh.

2788
03:10:53,060 --> 03:10:54,140
Hello, sir.

2789
03:10:56,060 --> 03:10:56,860
Buongiorno.

2790
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:04,300
Could you not stare at me while I parkour?

2791
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:17,600
Yeah.

2792
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:20,120
Who else is looking at me?

2793
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:21,880
I have a little icon.

2794
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:22,420
Okay.

2795
03:11:23,740 --> 03:11:25,940
How did I get over here?

2796
03:11:26,260 --> 03:11:27,140
That's so crazy.

2797
03:11:28,920 --> 03:11:29,660
Anyway.

2798
03:11:32,580 --> 03:11:33,400
Next one.

2799
03:11:35,860 --> 03:11:37,260
Let's get in there.

2800
03:11:37,380 --> 03:11:37,920
Take the picture.

2801
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:40,500
Third inscription.

2802
03:11:41,340 --> 03:11:41,640
Got.

2803
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:45,860
Back over this way.

2804
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:49,240
Just average priest behavior.

2805
03:11:49,400 --> 03:11:49,900
Exactly.

2806
03:11:50,900 --> 03:11:53,020
You think I can take this guy out?

2807
03:11:53,300 --> 03:11:56,480
You think he'll care if I start hopping up everywhere though.

2808
03:11:57,980 --> 03:11:58,460
Hello.

2809
03:12:01,140 --> 03:12:01,620
Hello.

2810
03:12:04,540 --> 03:12:05,480
Bored Sai.

2811
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:06,800
So true.

2812
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:10,260
I'll wait until he turns around.

2813
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:11,920
Yeah.

2814
03:12:12,140 --> 03:12:12,640
You want a picture?

2815
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:15,400
You want me to take a picture of you?

2816
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:15,740
No?

2817
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:16,200
Okay.

2818
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:18,640
Yeah.

2819
03:12:29,150 --> 03:12:30,310
Wasn't there one over here?

2820
03:12:30,590 --> 03:12:31,270
Or am I crazy?

2821
03:12:32,430 --> 03:12:34,430
I suddenly feel like raiding some lost arks.

2822
03:12:34,590 --> 03:12:34,890
True.

2823
03:12:37,410 --> 03:12:38,370
Oh, yeah.

2824
03:12:38,590 --> 03:12:39,310
There's like...

2825
03:12:40,070 --> 03:12:41,310
supposed to be one...

2826
03:12:42,210 --> 03:12:43,010
up there?

2827
03:12:43,870 --> 03:12:44,610
Do I keep going?

2828
03:12:45,670 --> 03:12:46,850
Oh, I do keep going.

2829
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:47,190
Okay.

2830
03:12:51,620 --> 03:12:52,760
Oh my god.

2831
03:12:52,780 --> 03:12:53,240
That was close.

2832
03:12:54,140 --> 03:12:54,940
Oh my god.

2833
03:12:54,980 --> 03:12:56,140
There's people painting even.

2834
03:12:57,640 --> 03:12:59,420
Oh, this is a restricted place.

2835
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:00,300
Oh gosh.

2836
03:13:00,400 --> 03:13:00,580
Okay.

2837
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:03,120
It's...

2838
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:04,740
right here though.

2839
03:13:07,560 --> 03:13:08,200
I'm secret.

2840
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:08,880
I'm secret.

2841
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:09,420
I'm secret.

2842
03:13:10,660 --> 03:13:11,620
Where is it?

2843
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:18,220
We're in the courtyards.

2844
03:13:18,940 --> 03:13:19,820
Oh my gosh.

2845
03:13:19,820 --> 03:13:22,580
Where is it?

2846
03:13:23,080 --> 03:13:23,540
Oh, whoops.

2847
03:13:23,620 --> 03:13:23,880
My bad.

2848
03:13:27,100 --> 03:13:27,780
Somewhere.

2849
03:13:32,320 --> 03:13:33,560
Probably up?

2850
03:13:36,060 --> 03:13:37,180
Oh, that way.

2851
03:13:37,460 --> 03:13:37,920
I think.

2852
03:13:39,720 --> 03:13:41,620
You think they'll notice me?

2853
03:13:46,030 --> 03:13:47,450
You think they'll notice?

2854
03:14:10,570 --> 03:14:11,970
Take

2855
03:14:17,470 --> 03:14:19,150
the picture.

2856
03:14:22,550 --> 03:14:23,670
Bad angle!

2857
03:14:30,610 --> 03:14:31,170
Okay.

2858
03:14:35,390 --> 03:14:35,950
Alright.

2859
03:14:37,550 --> 03:14:38,610
Bad angle.

2860
03:14:40,190 --> 03:14:41,270
Return to Antonio?

2861
03:14:41,770 --> 03:14:42,670
That was it?

2862
03:14:42,690 --> 03:14:43,350
That was all I needed?

2863
03:14:44,050 --> 03:14:44,610
Nice.

2864
03:14:45,570 --> 03:14:46,650
What about the other ones?

2865
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:49,110
Oh, interesting.

2866
03:14:49,430 --> 03:14:50,090
Okay, that's fun.

2867
03:14:55,350 --> 03:14:56,150
Professor Savage.

2868
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:11,960
Is it him?

2869
03:15:17,910 --> 03:15:19,670
I think it's that guy down there.

2870
03:15:22,930 --> 03:15:24,650
Good thing this guy over here is blind.

2871
03:15:25,790 --> 03:15:28,730
I want to go say hi to him, but I don't think we can get down there.

2872
03:15:32,570 --> 03:15:34,190
Yeah, what were you thinking?

2873
03:15:35,790 --> 03:15:38,390
I don't know how to even get down there, you guys.

2874
03:15:42,410 --> 03:15:43,230
Ledge on the left.

2875
03:15:45,770 --> 03:15:46,490
What is this?

2876
03:15:46,550 --> 03:15:47,410
Oh, repair kit.

2877
03:15:48,550 --> 03:15:48,950
Interesting.

2878
03:15:55,590 --> 03:15:56,790
Oh, there's a lot of guys.

2879
03:15:57,890 --> 03:15:58,690
Oh, wow!

2880
03:15:58,750 --> 03:15:59,410
There's a lot of people.

2881
03:15:59,410 --> 03:16:01,270
Oh wait, I can be in here.

2882
03:16:01,870 --> 03:16:03,190
This isn't a bad area.

2883
03:16:03,570 --> 03:16:05,590
Look, because my thing isn't red.

2884
03:16:06,610 --> 03:16:08,770
So we can actually just kind of freely walk around here.

2885
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:15,120
There's no exclamation point.

2886
03:16:16,760 --> 03:16:20,520
We are a free priest.

2887
03:16:22,080 --> 03:16:22,460
I think.

2888
03:16:24,340 --> 03:16:24,940
Hello.

2889
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:27,660
I'm the priest.

2890
03:16:28,660 --> 03:16:30,420
Buongiorno.

2891
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:36,920
And down.

2892
03:16:38,580 --> 03:16:39,440
Buongiorno.

2893
03:16:41,300 --> 03:16:44,300
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2894
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:48,160
Papa?

2895
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:48,340
Papa?

2896
03:16:55,230 --> 03:16:56,330
Oh no.

2897
03:16:57,850 --> 03:16:59,250
Who will replace him?

2898
03:17:02,990 --> 03:17:04,010
Mr. Savage.

2899
03:17:04,690 --> 03:17:05,030
Hello.

2900
03:17:07,370 --> 03:17:09,470
I wonder if it's possible to like...

2901
03:17:10,910 --> 03:17:12,170
To skip this guy.

2902
03:17:23,730 --> 03:17:26,710
Oh, a fellow archaeologist.

2903
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:27,750
We've heard about this guy.

2904
03:17:32,610 --> 03:17:33,350
Sydney!

2905
03:17:37,130 --> 03:17:38,530
He is very dapper.

2906
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:41,070
No!

2907
03:17:42,990 --> 03:17:43,230
No!

2908
03:17:46,930 --> 03:17:47,670
Breakthrough.

2909
03:17:51,470 --> 03:17:52,450
Yeah.

2910
03:17:56,390 --> 03:17:57,270
Yeah.

2911
03:18:21,970 --> 03:18:23,910
Absorum Angelorum.

2912
03:18:25,010 --> 03:18:27,850
I'm smarter than you, Professor Savage.

2913
03:18:33,810 --> 03:18:34,810
Lasagna.

2914
03:18:38,030 --> 03:18:39,730
I don't know.

2915
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:45,830
Retrieved.

2916
03:18:46,330 --> 03:18:47,570
I love this guy.

2917
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:50,170
Retrieved.

2918
03:18:52,030 --> 03:18:53,590
Alright, alright, alright.

2919
03:18:54,710 --> 03:18:57,830
This guy has just been rambling all by himself down here.

2920
03:18:58,970 --> 03:19:02,470
Yeah, father.

2921
03:19:04,010 --> 03:19:06,950
And he is so...

2922
03:19:07,470 --> 03:19:10,370
He is so like... ominous sometimes.

2923
03:19:12,970 --> 03:19:13,650
To the library.

2924
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:14,250
Ok.

2925
03:19:14,510 --> 03:19:15,130
To the library.

2926
03:19:15,130 --> 03:19:15,350
Library.

2927
03:19:22,090 --> 03:19:23,130
Yeah, don't...

2928
03:19:23,130 --> 03:19:23,630
What's this?

2929
03:19:23,830 --> 03:19:24,270
A card.

2930
03:19:25,250 --> 03:19:25,330
Oh!

2931
03:19:26,050 --> 03:19:26,570
A fool.

2932
03:19:32,430 --> 03:19:33,470
I'll get you guy.

2933
03:19:33,650 --> 03:19:34,210
Don't worry.

2934
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:35,930
I'll get you little man.

2935
03:19:36,430 --> 03:19:37,350
Your little apprentice.

2936
03:19:38,330 --> 03:19:39,390
Am I going the right way?

2937
03:19:42,530 --> 03:19:43,570
It's so...

2938
03:19:43,570 --> 03:19:45,210
It's so tiring being a priest.

2939
03:19:46,230 --> 03:19:47,570
Ok, we are going the right way.

2940
03:19:49,410 --> 03:19:50,570
A minto card?

2941
03:19:50,750 --> 03:19:51,250
Hey, hey, hey.

2942
03:19:52,510 --> 03:19:53,350
What do you mean by that?

2943
03:19:58,610 --> 03:19:59,090
Oh!

2944
03:19:59,290 --> 03:20:00,630
This is the fast travel!

2945
03:20:02,530 --> 03:20:03,010
Oh!

2946
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:04,590
That's so awesome!

2947
03:20:04,750 --> 03:20:05,030
Ok.

2948
03:20:05,870 --> 03:20:07,730
Do you think they'll think that's witchcraft?

2949
03:20:09,610 --> 03:20:10,090
Nope.

2950
03:20:10,790 --> 03:20:11,710
Ok, we're fine.

2951
03:20:16,570 --> 03:20:18,570
They mentioned it earlier, but I...

2952
03:20:25,810 --> 03:20:27,330
I wanna go in there.

2953
03:20:28,950 --> 03:20:29,890
I wanna steal.

2954
03:20:30,890 --> 03:20:32,010
I wanna do crimes.

2955
03:20:37,610 --> 03:20:38,050
Ok.

2956
03:20:40,030 --> 03:20:40,890
Oh, sorry.

2957
03:20:41,030 --> 03:20:41,570
It's not this door.

2958
03:20:41,830 --> 03:20:42,030
Oh!

2959
03:20:42,910 --> 03:20:43,690
There's so many more people.

2960
03:20:44,770 --> 03:20:46,910
Is that the Ventura guy?

2961
03:20:48,470 --> 03:20:48,970
Ok.

2962
03:20:49,350 --> 03:20:50,150
Alright, we can go.

2963
03:20:50,330 --> 03:20:51,330
Actually, let's go upstairs.

2964
03:20:52,510 --> 03:20:53,350
Let's go up the up way.

2965
03:20:55,210 --> 03:20:57,810
This lady is still working on this lamp.

2966
03:20:57,910 --> 03:20:58,890
Wait, it's gone now.

2967
03:20:59,970 --> 03:21:00,250
Ma'am?

2968
03:21:02,910 --> 03:21:04,450
Ma'am, the lightbulb.

2969
03:21:05,430 --> 03:21:06,790
Ma'am, the lightbulb is missing.

2970
03:21:13,730 --> 03:21:14,850
How mysterious.

2971
03:21:18,920 --> 03:21:20,080
What are you doing?

2972
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:25,000
Alright, this guy is still listening to his record.

2973
03:21:25,940 --> 03:21:26,800
I'm here!

2974
03:21:30,620 --> 03:21:31,180
Crescenzos.

2975
03:21:32,820 --> 03:21:33,660
Yeah, I got it.

2976
03:21:35,580 --> 03:21:36,180
Take these.

2977
03:21:39,740 --> 03:21:41,840
How did we print these so fast?

2978
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:43,140
Where are your magnifying glasses?

2979
03:21:44,740 --> 03:21:46,420
Alright, let's investigate.

2980
03:21:47,340 --> 03:21:48,900
I'm examining.

2981
03:21:51,800 --> 03:21:53,040
This looks terrible.

2982
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:55,120
I need to be a better photographer.

2983
03:22:02,560 --> 03:22:04,200
1930's Polaroid.

2984
03:22:13,020 --> 03:22:14,400
Like a giant.

2985
03:22:15,300 --> 03:22:16,480
What about this one?

2986
03:22:16,840 --> 03:22:18,420
This also has a really big guy.

2987
03:22:19,580 --> 03:22:20,740
And the sword.

2988
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:25,780
A warrior.

2989
03:22:26,540 --> 03:22:27,420
What about this one?

2990
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:29,160
This guy is dead.

2991
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:31,840
This one is...

2992
03:22:32,740 --> 03:22:33,560
Oh, treasure.

2993
03:22:37,320 --> 03:22:40,760
A giant man.

2994
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:44,720
What do these inscriptions say?

2995
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:47,840
It says...

2996
03:23:02,690 --> 03:23:05,490
It says...

2997
03:23:05,490 --> 03:23:10,350
Secret passage.

2998
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:16,730
Oh!

2999
03:23:31,730 --> 03:23:33,950
Ok, Indy, let's use our indoor voice again.

3000
03:23:34,750 --> 03:23:36,170
Oh, geez!

3001
03:23:44,550 --> 03:23:44,970
Ok.

3002
03:23:45,730 --> 03:23:46,130
A demon?

3003
03:23:52,470 --> 03:23:53,250
Alright!

3004
03:24:03,590 --> 03:24:05,350
What the hell?

3005
03:24:06,250 --> 03:24:07,370
Oh, look, I'm looking.

3006
03:24:09,230 --> 03:24:10,310
I'm observing.

3007
03:24:11,550 --> 03:24:12,610
I'm examining.

3008
03:24:12,610 --> 03:24:14,550
I'm translating the Latin.

3009
03:24:26,830 --> 03:24:28,070
Excuse me?

3010
03:24:32,270 --> 03:24:36,130
Wait, that's real blood?

3011
03:24:36,130 --> 03:24:37,490
Or rum?

3012
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:42,810
He whipped that out so, so, so excitedly.

3013
03:24:45,470 --> 03:24:47,710
Indy's got a little look in his eyes.

3014
03:24:53,070 --> 03:24:53,990
I will.

3015
03:24:57,050 --> 03:24:58,670
The camera icon is up.

3016
03:24:58,790 --> 03:25:01,810
Yeah, maybe we can take a photo of him and it gives us some points, alright?

3017
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:04,610
Say cheese!

3018
03:25:06,310 --> 03:25:11,590
There must be more interesting things to take a picture of than this old priest, Indy.

3019
03:25:11,910 --> 03:25:12,350
You look great.

3020
03:25:18,770 --> 03:25:21,830
Maybe there is an explosive secret hidden below the tower.

3021
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:23,870
I would be curious to hear about it.

3022
03:25:23,930 --> 03:25:26,130
Ok, I will go right now.

3023
03:25:26,590 --> 03:25:26,890
Rescue.

3024
03:25:26,990 --> 03:25:28,150
Oh, we have to rescue Sidney.

3025
03:25:29,550 --> 03:25:31,810
I will go eventually.

3026
03:25:36,130 --> 03:25:38,450
Take a picture of the giant.

3027
03:25:39,910 --> 03:25:40,710
Where?

3028
03:25:45,310 --> 03:25:46,870
Oh, it's right outside.

3029
03:25:49,370 --> 03:25:52,410
Ok, we just gotta keep going.

3030
03:25:56,470 --> 03:25:57,750
Adjusting painting.

3031
03:25:58,930 --> 03:26:04,130
You're therefore perfect, even as your father who is in heaven is perfect.

3032
03:26:04,350 --> 03:26:06,730
That's fine, you can take more photos and stuff.

3033
03:26:08,210 --> 03:26:08,430
Ok.

3034
03:26:10,450 --> 03:26:11,330
Rescue Sidney.

3035
03:26:11,490 --> 03:26:13,270
On our way, on our way.

3036
03:26:16,350 --> 03:26:22,930
I'm gonna rescue Sidney and think then I might be done for today.

3037
03:26:23,910 --> 03:26:25,170
How do I get in there?

3038
03:26:28,330 --> 03:26:29,210
Ok, sorry.

3039
03:26:29,850 --> 03:26:30,610
So sorry.

3040
03:26:32,410 --> 03:26:33,850
Ok, we gotta climb over.

3041
03:26:33,970 --> 03:26:35,250
Wait, but it's all like barbed wire.

3042
03:26:35,350 --> 03:26:37,330
Ok, we gotta find an area without barbed wire.

3043
03:26:38,350 --> 03:26:44,370
Or... No, I don't think... I was gonna say we could go from up here, but I don't think we can.

3044
03:26:46,210 --> 03:26:49,230
Oh, was this open before?

3045
03:26:50,290 --> 03:26:51,110
Ok, my turn.

3046
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:52,870
Ok, just kidding.

3047
03:26:54,210 --> 03:26:56,230
Everything has a barbed wire you guys.

3048
03:26:58,250 --> 03:26:59,250
What's this way?

3049
03:27:00,870 --> 03:27:03,030
The way we are supposed to go apparently.

3050
03:27:06,630 --> 03:27:07,290
Wait.

3051
03:27:09,510 --> 03:27:10,810
Is this to Sidney?

3052
03:27:13,830 --> 03:27:15,050
I guess so.

3053
03:27:19,330 --> 03:27:20,430
Oh, oh.

3054
03:27:26,410 --> 03:27:27,530
Excuse you.

3055
03:27:28,050 --> 03:27:30,470
Captains can see through your disguises.

3056
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:31,490
Ok.

3057
03:27:32,410 --> 03:27:34,210
What do you mean disguises?

3058
03:27:35,330 --> 03:27:36,770
Ok, we are going this way, right?

3059
03:27:36,990 --> 03:27:37,150
Ok.

3060
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:50,440
Oh, I'm in a restricted area?

3061
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:51,700
Ok, nevermind.

3062
03:27:53,860 --> 03:27:55,740
How do we want to go about this?

3063
03:27:58,060 --> 03:27:59,320
Nobody is noticing me?

3064
03:28:00,220 --> 03:28:01,140
Don't notice me?

3065
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:02,520
Nobody is looking at me?

3066
03:28:04,180 --> 03:28:04,740
Everybody...

3067
03:28:07,280 --> 03:28:08,040
Let's go.

3068
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:09,240
Let's take the long way.

3069
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:14,100
The fountain of confession.

3070
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:15,280
Sealed?

3071
03:28:15,720 --> 03:28:16,740
Oh, come on.

3072
03:28:20,340 --> 03:28:22,200
Let's go the even longer way?

3073
03:28:22,620 --> 03:28:23,620
The longest way?

3074
03:28:25,880 --> 03:28:28,460
We are going to go super duper long way?

3075
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:31,020
We are going to go all the way?

3076
03:28:31,620 --> 03:28:32,080
Probably?

3077
03:28:35,280 --> 03:28:35,620
Ok.

3078
03:28:36,640 --> 03:28:37,080
Alright.

3079
03:28:38,660 --> 03:28:39,940
Here we go.

3080
03:28:40,440 --> 03:28:41,640
No confessions right now.

3081
03:28:42,060 --> 03:28:42,280
Wait.

3082
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:45,800
Does it say what's wrong with it?

3083
03:28:46,680 --> 03:28:47,720
Why can't we get in?

3084
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:49,340
Why can't we go?

3085
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:50,260
Why?

3086
03:28:52,420 --> 03:28:53,720
The barbed wire.

3087
03:28:53,960 --> 03:28:55,800
That would be a good weapon to pick up, I think.

3088
03:28:56,780 --> 03:29:01,080
We are going to go the absolute super duper long way.

3089
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:01,900
Nevermind.

3090
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:10,300
We are going to go the longest way actually possible.

3091
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:15,180
We are going to go the mega long way.

3092
03:29:15,720 --> 03:29:17,160
The mega LeDawn way.

3093
03:29:29,700 --> 03:29:32,760
What am I supposed to take a picture of?

3094
03:29:36,420 --> 03:29:37,300
These guys?

3095
03:29:40,380 --> 03:29:42,100
What am I supposed to be taking a picture of?

3096
03:29:42,620 --> 03:29:44,460
Oh, they noticed I'm here.

3097
03:29:46,980 --> 03:29:49,500
Oh wow, it's another thing.

3098
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:52,800
New fieldwork.

3099
03:29:53,020 --> 03:29:53,760
Fifth inscription.

3100
03:29:54,220 --> 03:29:55,440
The secret of giants.

3101
03:29:57,740 --> 03:29:59,340
Maybe it wasn't them at all.

3102
03:30:01,240 --> 03:30:04,120
Is there any way I can climb up there?

3103
03:30:06,920 --> 03:30:08,280
I don't think so.

3104
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:08,360
Okay,

3105
03:30:11,720 --> 03:30:13,280
we're gonna...

3106
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:24,680
How do I get over there?

3107
03:30:40,090 --> 03:30:41,770
Is it because you're not getting fed?

3108
03:30:41,830 --> 03:30:42,770
That's why you're getting sick?

3109
03:30:46,390 --> 03:30:47,830
I don't really understand.

3110
03:30:48,150 --> 03:30:49,530
I'm just exploring at this point.

3111
03:30:49,530 --> 03:30:50,810
Oh...

3112
03:30:53,010 --> 03:30:55,370
Okay, I guess I'm allowed down here.

3113
03:30:57,990 --> 03:30:59,570
What's going on in here?

3114
03:31:00,950 --> 03:31:01,930
Oh boy.

3115
03:31:07,530 --> 03:31:08,550
What's this?

3116
03:31:13,450 --> 03:31:14,970
Yeah, what's going on?

3117
03:31:14,970 --> 03:31:16,530
Oh, new discovery.

3118
03:31:17,150 --> 03:31:18,210
Underground boxing!

3119
03:31:18,330 --> 03:31:19,850
Oh wait, don't tell me what it is.

3120
03:31:20,290 --> 03:31:21,350
We ruined the mystery.

3121
03:31:26,420 --> 03:31:28,000
I fit in?

3122
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:34,160
What's that?

3123
03:31:36,280 --> 03:31:37,340
What is that?

3124
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:39,760
Oh wait.

3125
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:42,720
This is where we were just before.

3126
03:31:46,340 --> 03:31:50,340
This is where we were and we saw like the...

3127
03:31:51,560 --> 03:31:53,440
We fast traveled.

3128
03:31:57,260 --> 03:31:59,640
I think I'm allowed to sprint here.

3129
03:32:01,660 --> 03:32:02,860
The great circle.

3130
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:05,280
We did it!

3131
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:09,140
We went into the great circle!

3132
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:15,220
One hand it's weird that this game is in FPS.

3133
03:32:15,580 --> 03:32:18,940
On the other hand, Indie kinda looks like my dad from 20 years ago.

3134
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:20,600
That's also weird.

3135
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:23,920
Why is the frame rate dropping all of a sudden?

3136
03:32:26,060 --> 03:32:26,580
Alrighty.

3137
03:32:28,440 --> 03:32:31,140
Alrighty, we're figuring out...

3138
03:32:37,880 --> 03:32:39,380
Oh, we're getting noticed?

3139
03:32:40,140 --> 03:32:40,600
Just kidding.

3140
03:32:40,600 --> 03:32:43,600
Oh god, he's about to notice me.

3141
03:32:49,080 --> 03:32:50,400
Let me in!

3142
03:32:51,700 --> 03:32:53,640
Let me in to the fight club!

3143
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:58,760
Maybe I can get them one at a time here.

3144
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:03,080
You got your fist up.

3145
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:04,780
Come on!

3146
03:33:07,440 --> 03:33:08,460
Yeah, I'm right here!

3147
03:33:10,340 --> 03:33:11,140
Come on!

3148
03:33:11,280 --> 03:33:12,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3149
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:19,600
Oh, how do I put my camera away?

3150
03:33:24,160 --> 03:33:24,560
Nice.

3151
03:33:26,300 --> 03:33:27,080
Oh, you're still up?

3152
03:33:28,340 --> 03:33:29,840
Will you let me into the fight club now?

3153
03:33:37,400 --> 03:33:38,520
I ate the bagel.

3154
03:33:43,280 --> 03:33:47,100
Does my suspicion ever go down?

3155
03:33:51,170 --> 03:33:52,810
No trace of an enemy.

3156
03:33:53,130 --> 03:33:54,450
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

3157
03:33:55,190 --> 03:33:56,470
Nothing here.

3158
03:33:58,350 --> 03:33:59,590
Nothing here.

3159
03:34:03,150 --> 03:34:04,950
I'll just put you...

3160
03:34:06,970 --> 03:34:07,970
Right there.

3161
03:34:08,650 --> 03:34:09,950
Oh, I'm better now!

3162
03:34:10,050 --> 03:34:10,730
Okay, nice.

3163
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:11,810
It does eventually...

3164
03:34:12,470 --> 03:34:14,290
It does eventually disappear.

3165
03:34:16,170 --> 03:34:16,610
Okay.

3166
03:34:17,990 --> 03:34:19,690
I can't believe the weather we're having today.

3167
03:34:21,730 --> 03:34:22,170
See?

3168
03:34:22,350 --> 03:34:23,310
That's how you escape.

3169
03:34:23,990 --> 03:34:26,770
You just go after one guy.

3170
03:34:29,990 --> 03:34:32,350
Guys, I really am not sure how to get up there.

3171
03:34:36,170 --> 03:34:37,490
Wait a second, they're all gone.

3172
03:34:42,090 --> 03:34:43,670
Oh, that's the captain right there.

3173
03:34:43,790 --> 03:34:44,490
Oh my god.

3174
03:34:44,930 --> 03:34:45,490
Oh my god.

3175
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:46,490
I'm gonna leave.

3176
03:34:46,670 --> 03:34:47,130
I'm gonna leave.

3177
03:34:51,490 --> 03:34:51,730
I'm gonna...

3178
03:35:07,750 --> 03:35:08,510
He

3179
03:35:13,430 --> 03:35:15,350
doesn't notice me though.

3180
03:35:20,410 --> 03:35:23,850
Can I get up?

3181
03:35:24,530 --> 03:35:25,090
There we go.

3182
03:35:27,370 --> 03:35:30,090
Is it suspicious if I jump up here?

3183
03:35:35,130 --> 03:35:36,830
Nope, apparently not.

3184
03:35:37,930 --> 03:35:40,650
I'm just, you know, a scaffolding priest.

3185
03:35:41,730 --> 03:35:43,110
Don't mind me.

3186
03:35:46,230 --> 03:35:48,350
I'm in a restricted area now.

3187
03:35:50,950 --> 03:35:55,050
But this is nothing to be alarmed about.

3188
03:35:55,190 --> 03:35:56,690
Oh god, my chat is broken.

3189
03:35:59,010 --> 03:36:00,070
It's okay.

3190
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:06,530
Oh, and there's dogs and there's... Okay, we need to go like right here, I think.

3191
03:36:10,110 --> 03:36:11,310
And we'll go inside.

3192
03:36:13,130 --> 03:36:14,710
How are we gonna rescue this kid?

3193
03:36:15,710 --> 03:36:16,410
Okay, inside.

3194
03:36:17,450 --> 03:36:17,830
Nice.

3195
03:36:20,050 --> 03:36:21,290
This is the place, right?

3196
03:36:22,330 --> 03:36:22,890
No!

3197
03:36:23,470 --> 03:36:25,090
I went into the wrong wood?

3198
03:36:31,090 --> 03:36:31,490
Hmm.

3199
03:36:37,370 --> 03:36:38,850
Oh, it's that one over there.

3200
03:36:39,310 --> 03:36:40,830
Wow, there's a symbol on this door.

3201
03:36:41,630 --> 03:36:42,570
I wonder what it means.

3202
03:36:43,210 --> 03:36:44,350
Is there anything else we can take in here?

3203
03:36:46,030 --> 03:36:46,830
Take that.

3204
03:36:50,130 --> 03:36:51,810
I'm afraid to open this.

3205
03:36:55,810 --> 03:36:56,550
Take that.

3206
03:36:59,670 --> 03:37:00,270
Let's go.

3207
03:37:00,530 --> 03:37:02,650
Sorry guys, my chat is broken and I can't read it.

3208
03:37:03,790 --> 03:37:04,350
Okay.

3209
03:37:05,030 --> 03:37:06,230
They turn around.

3210
03:37:09,330 --> 03:37:10,370
Oh my god.

3211
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:18,410
Go, go, go.

3212
03:37:19,030 --> 03:37:19,750
Go, go, go.

3213
03:37:20,590 --> 03:37:21,350
Right here.

3214
03:37:22,290 --> 03:37:22,810
Oh shoot.

3215
03:37:24,290 --> 03:37:25,790
That's where I need to go.

3216
03:37:29,170 --> 03:37:29,730
Let's...

3217
03:37:31,090 --> 03:37:33,010
Let's... Can you pet the dog?

3218
03:37:34,110 --> 03:37:34,550
Huh?

3219
03:37:40,170 --> 03:37:42,570
You think there's gonna be enough... Oh, bless you.

3220
03:37:45,740 --> 03:37:47,500
You think the dog will notice me?

3221
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:49,680
Probably, I imagine.

3222
03:37:49,780 --> 03:37:50,180
I'm scared.

3223
03:37:51,020 --> 03:37:51,520
Rush him?

3224
03:37:56,610 --> 03:37:57,790
Where's the guy and his dog?

3225
03:37:57,870 --> 03:37:58,370
Oh, right here.

3226
03:37:58,530 --> 03:37:59,110
There's the dog.

3227
03:37:59,310 --> 03:38:00,770
It's just a dog patrolling?

3228
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:03,010
They even have the dogs patrolling?

3229
03:38:03,290 --> 03:38:04,630
Oh my god, he's staring right at me.

3230
03:38:07,350 --> 03:38:08,230
Nice doggy.

3231
03:38:08,790 --> 03:38:09,710
Yeah, that's right.

3232
03:38:22,830 --> 03:38:23,190
Good.

3233
03:38:23,390 --> 03:38:24,910
Oh, he even opened the door for me.

3234
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:26,230
This is the room, right?

3235
03:38:29,030 --> 03:38:29,750
Come here.

3236
03:38:32,870 --> 03:38:33,410
Come here.

3237
03:38:34,010 --> 03:38:34,770
Inside we go.

3238
03:38:40,840 --> 03:38:42,080
Guy didn't hear anything, right?

3239
03:38:56,080 --> 03:38:58,420
I'm trying to see if I can get something, you know.

3240
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:07,930
Ok, let's just...

3241
03:39:11,090 --> 03:39:11,850
Oh shoot.

3242
03:39:13,070 --> 03:39:13,790
Oh shoot.

3243
03:39:14,250 --> 03:39:14,690
Oh shoot.

3244
03:39:16,430 --> 03:39:17,450
Oh no, no, no.

3245
03:39:17,730 --> 03:39:18,210
No, no, no.

3246
03:39:18,650 --> 03:39:18,870
No!

3247
03:39:19,650 --> 03:39:20,550
Hey, stop parrying!

3248
03:39:20,650 --> 03:39:21,530
Stop blocking, buddy!

3249
03:39:22,130 --> 03:39:22,570
Oh god.

3250
03:39:27,330 --> 03:39:28,090
We're fine.

3251
03:39:38,860 --> 03:39:41,400
Oh my god, this is so...

3252
03:39:45,620 --> 03:39:55,200
I think we got him.

3253
03:39:58,140 --> 03:39:58,840
Nice!

3254
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:03,820
Yeah, Robin Blind!

3255
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:05,900
Oh what?

3256
03:40:06,100 --> 03:40:07,700
This was here the whole time!

3257
03:40:09,420 --> 03:40:10,100
Oh shoot.

3258
03:40:13,440 --> 03:40:13,920
Ok,

3259
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:18,820
they just don't stop coming, do they?

3260
03:40:19,240 --> 03:40:20,080
How many are up here?

3261
03:40:21,580 --> 03:40:22,700
I think I got everybody.

3262
03:40:23,880 --> 03:40:25,180
I think we're good.

3263
03:40:29,800 --> 03:40:32,440
Might as well just loot the place now, you know.

3264
03:40:33,180 --> 03:40:34,120
Hell yeah!

3265
03:40:35,460 --> 03:40:36,480
Think he's dead?

3266
03:40:37,020 --> 03:40:37,020
No!

3267
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:39,180
I'm not a killer!

3268
03:40:40,860 --> 03:40:41,300
Postcard.

3269
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:43,560
Oh no, I missed it!

3270
03:40:46,260 --> 03:40:47,280
Crucifixion of Saint Peter.

3271
03:40:47,480 --> 03:40:48,060
That's what it is.

3272
03:40:48,720 --> 03:40:49,020
Everybody?

3273
03:40:50,940 --> 03:40:52,200
Maybe I had to do this.

3274
03:40:52,280 --> 03:40:53,740
Maybe I couldn't go through the other way.

3275
03:40:56,220 --> 03:40:59,120
Maybe I couldn't go through the other way, because...

3276
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:02,560
Maybe it's locked.

3277
03:41:02,700 --> 03:41:03,440
Let's go check it.

3278
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:07,740
You know, it might be like... Oh, you can't go through here.

3279
03:41:07,880 --> 03:41:08,480
Yeah, see?

3280
03:41:09,560 --> 03:41:10,700
I had the right idea.

3281
03:41:12,460 --> 03:41:13,560
I had the right idea.

3282
03:41:14,480 --> 03:41:15,580
Don't leave them any food.

3283
03:41:18,720 --> 03:41:20,200
Or any entertainment.

3284
03:41:20,980 --> 03:41:22,120
Taking your playing cards.

3285
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:25,560
Actually yeah, let's eat our apple-ies.

3286
03:41:35,260 --> 03:41:36,140
Nice, and...

3287
03:41:36,140 --> 03:41:38,820
Well, I can't take their bread, so...

3288
03:41:38,820 --> 03:41:41,200
Take that, take that, take that.

3289
03:41:41,320 --> 03:41:41,580
Nice.

3290
03:41:42,340 --> 03:41:43,120
Any of these open?

3291
03:41:43,460 --> 03:41:43,800
No.

3292
03:41:45,400 --> 03:41:46,820
OK, let's go get Sidney.

3293
03:41:47,900 --> 03:41:49,440
Sidney, I'm coming for you!

3294
03:41:49,900 --> 03:41:50,880
Whole lemons.

3295
03:41:51,680 --> 03:41:53,480
Indiana Jones is kind of wild for that.

3296
03:41:56,140 --> 03:41:57,020
Oh shit!

3297
03:41:58,400 --> 03:41:59,360
That's not Sidney.

3298
03:42:00,060 --> 03:42:03,160
I was like, wow, Sidney is a little bigger than I imagined.

3299
03:42:16,470 --> 03:42:17,070
Nevermind!

3300
03:42:17,730 --> 03:42:19,210
Is this guy insane?

3301
03:42:26,970 --> 03:42:27,570
Sidney!

3302
03:42:30,880 --> 03:42:32,400
Got the jail cell key.

3303
03:42:35,520 --> 03:42:37,020
Oh, let's heal.

3304
03:42:39,480 --> 03:42:40,400
Let's heal.

3305
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:43,460
And I will heal.

3306
03:42:44,500 --> 03:42:45,320
Oh, you know what?

3307
03:42:45,340 --> 03:42:45,760
Grab that.

3308
03:42:45,880 --> 03:42:46,520
OK, nevermind.

3309
03:42:46,520 --> 03:42:47,960
I thought I was still in the menu.

3310
03:42:48,180 --> 03:42:48,680
I'm stupid.

3311
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:52,060
Good job everybody!

3312
03:42:55,160 --> 03:42:55,720
Nice!

3313
03:42:57,440 --> 03:42:58,000
Yay!

3314
03:42:58,280 --> 03:42:59,760
Sidney is coming home!

3315
03:43:00,580 --> 03:43:03,060
Don't attack me, don't attack me, don't attack me.

3316
03:43:03,700 --> 03:43:04,160
Sidney!

3317
03:43:10,040 --> 03:43:10,600
Sidney!

3318
03:43:18,180 --> 03:43:19,520
Oh no, sir!

3319
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:21,320
I'm so sorry, sir!

3320
03:43:26,080 --> 03:43:27,280
Aye, sir.

3321
03:43:27,660 --> 03:43:28,500
Sorry, sir.

3322
03:43:30,080 --> 03:43:30,680
Please, sir.

3323
03:43:31,020 --> 03:43:31,920
Can I have some more?

3324
03:43:33,920 --> 03:43:34,160
Yeah.

3325
03:43:37,800 --> 03:43:38,620
Oh, come on.

3326
03:43:40,920 --> 03:43:41,520
Giuseppe?

3327
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:47,840
What happened to the frame rate?

3328
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:55,380
I wouldn't say clear.

3329
03:43:55,520 --> 03:43:57,160
I don't think I took care of the outside.

3330
03:44:00,580 --> 03:44:03,340
Get to the excavation site.

3331
03:44:04,280 --> 03:44:05,660
Where the hell is that?

3332
03:44:06,640 --> 03:44:07,220
OK.

3333
03:44:08,120 --> 03:44:08,780
Oh, I see.

3334
03:44:08,860 --> 03:44:12,260
We go back through and then we go that way.

3335
03:44:12,260 --> 03:44:17,100
Which we will do next time.

3336
03:44:17,320 --> 03:44:17,920
We got a letter.

3337
03:44:18,080 --> 03:44:18,720
Sidney's letter.

3338
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:43,140
No time.

3339
03:44:58,880 --> 03:45:00,120
Hold on.

3340
03:45:00,220 --> 03:45:06,160
I kind of want to maybe start the game not in here when we play next time.

3341
03:45:06,260 --> 03:45:08,860
So let's leave.

3342
03:45:09,740 --> 03:45:10,380
You know?

3343
03:45:11,100 --> 03:45:11,780
Novel idea.

3344
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:16,740
Let's leave the premises and then we shall...

3345
03:45:16,740 --> 03:45:18,520
What is this?

3346
03:45:19,220 --> 03:45:21,860
And then we shall...

3347
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:26,700
Start next week.

3348
03:45:27,500 --> 03:45:27,880
Wait.

3349
03:45:30,420 --> 03:45:31,180
Hello?

3350
03:45:31,920 --> 03:45:33,020
Why am I not using this?

3351
03:45:34,660 --> 03:45:35,140
Use?

3352
03:45:35,980 --> 03:45:37,240
Oh, my health is full.

3353
03:45:37,360 --> 03:45:38,200
I just realized.

3354
03:45:39,300 --> 03:45:40,980
Oh, I'm too good at this game.

3355
03:45:42,120 --> 03:45:42,800
What's down here?

3356
03:45:44,120 --> 03:45:44,740
What was that?

3357
03:45:45,320 --> 03:45:45,780
Take that.

3358
03:45:46,460 --> 03:45:46,940
Nice.

3359
03:45:47,180 --> 03:45:47,320
OK.

3360
03:45:51,100 --> 03:45:51,920
Full HP.

3361
03:45:53,820 --> 03:45:56,620
I could have done this the entire... Oh my god.

3362
03:45:56,920 --> 03:45:57,540
Wait a second.

3363
03:45:58,340 --> 03:45:59,740
Wait, this was always an option?

3364
03:45:59,940 --> 03:46:00,340
No.

3365
03:46:00,460 --> 03:46:00,900
No way.

3366
03:46:04,220 --> 03:46:04,820
No.

3367
03:46:05,620 --> 03:46:06,120
Yeah, see?

3368
03:46:06,220 --> 03:46:07,780
We are going through the garden now.

3369
03:46:12,080 --> 03:46:15,380
And now we are not in a restricted zone.

3370
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:18,020
Now we are...

3371
03:46:23,900 --> 03:46:25,100
Oh shoot.

3372
03:46:25,100 --> 03:46:26,100
I better stay away from here.

3373
03:46:32,180 --> 03:46:32,780
No!

3374
03:46:32,780 --> 03:46:33,380
No!

3375
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:35,980
Oh, is it because I have a weapon?

3376
03:46:36,340 --> 03:46:36,740
Oh shoot.

3377
03:46:38,760 --> 03:46:39,360
No.

3378
03:46:43,940 --> 03:46:45,480
Back to Fight Club.

3379
03:46:47,780 --> 03:46:48,540
Hey.

3380
03:46:51,320 --> 03:46:52,620
Let me in.

3381
03:46:54,460 --> 03:46:55,620
Let me in.

3382
03:46:56,940 --> 03:46:59,480
So the first rule of Fight Club is...

3383
03:47:01,020 --> 03:47:06,240
You show us the Fight Club signature fight dance.

3384
03:47:08,620 --> 03:47:09,220
Fight!

3385
03:47:09,460 --> 03:47:09,460
Fight!

3386
03:47:09,560 --> 03:47:09,680
Fight!

3387
03:47:10,060 --> 03:47:10,420
Fight!

3388
03:47:10,680 --> 03:47:15,760
Are they coming for me?

3389
03:47:16,160 --> 03:47:18,560
I'll just chill here until...

3390
03:47:18,560 --> 03:47:20,420
Until they get tired I guess.

3391
03:47:23,440 --> 03:47:24,640
Nothing here.

3392
03:47:25,900 --> 03:47:26,860
Oh my god!

3393
03:47:26,920 --> 03:47:28,460
He just said nothing here!

3394
03:47:28,940 --> 03:47:31,360
This game is reading my... Oh shoot.

3395
03:47:32,700 --> 03:47:33,880
Nothing here.

3396
03:47:36,500 --> 03:47:38,540
No trace of an enemy, exactly.

3397
03:47:41,580 --> 03:47:42,480
This game!

3398
03:47:42,740 --> 03:47:44,320
This game is reading my mind!

3399
03:47:44,820 --> 03:47:45,980
I can't do this anymore.

3400
03:47:48,440 --> 03:47:49,940
This is fruitless, yeah.

3401
03:47:50,640 --> 03:47:51,520
This is fruit fly.

3402
03:47:51,800 --> 03:47:52,900
Actually, you are fruitless.

3403
03:47:52,960 --> 03:47:53,720
I took all of them.

3404
03:47:56,100 --> 03:47:57,460
I took all your fruit.

3405
03:47:58,380 --> 03:47:59,320
Oh, we are better now.

3406
03:47:59,660 --> 03:47:59,900
Nice.

3407
03:48:00,060 --> 03:48:01,460
Let's go.

3408
03:48:03,300 --> 03:48:05,020
It's actually a great location.

3409
03:48:05,160 --> 03:48:07,660
Oh, sorry, I couldn't... I can't read your super chats.

3410
03:48:07,780 --> 03:48:07,960
No!

3411
03:48:08,920 --> 03:48:09,860
Sorry guys.

3412
03:48:10,200 --> 03:48:13,600
Alright, anyway, I'm gonna drop this item.

3413
03:48:14,520 --> 03:48:16,260
And now I'm really not suspicious.

3414
03:48:18,420 --> 03:48:21,620
I'm Mr. No Suspicion Priest Guy.

3415
03:48:25,240 --> 03:48:28,160
The priest you'd never be suspicious of guy.

3416
03:48:29,700 --> 03:48:33,440
The least suspicious priest ever.

3417
03:48:40,630 --> 03:48:44,630
I like that it saves a lot actually.

3418
03:48:45,030 --> 03:48:45,610
It's pretty nice.

3419
03:48:46,550 --> 03:48:47,390
Okay, we just keep going.

3420
03:48:51,690 --> 03:48:53,650
Okay, Mr. Savage is gone too.

3421
03:48:56,570 --> 03:48:57,590
Awesome, awesome.

3422
03:49:06,030 --> 03:49:06,770
Good day.

3423
03:49:07,850 --> 03:49:08,730
May I enter?

3424
03:49:10,150 --> 03:49:10,990
How do you do?

3425
03:49:11,150 --> 03:49:11,650
May I enter?

3426
03:49:12,510 --> 03:49:13,270
Oh, okay.

3427
03:49:13,870 --> 03:49:14,670
Can I pet the dog?

3428
03:49:16,850 --> 03:49:19,170
I'm trying to pet the dog, please.

3429
03:49:20,650 --> 03:49:22,630
What if I sneak behind you?

3430
03:49:25,870 --> 03:49:26,350
Okay.

3431
03:49:27,490 --> 03:49:28,610
Alrighty guys, yeah.

3432
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:29,730
We are gonna end it here.

3433
03:49:30,970 --> 03:49:32,190
I think this is a good spot.

3434
03:49:32,190 --> 03:49:38,190
Thank you guys for... I'm so sorry I'm PNG this whole stream.

3435
03:49:41,010 --> 03:49:43,190
Hopefully, maybe next time...

3436
03:49:44,330 --> 03:49:48,970
Maybe next time I can... I don't know, I think I'll have to be a PNG again.

3437
03:49:49,370 --> 03:49:49,850
But that's okay.

3438
03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:51,370
This has been a lot of fun.

3439
03:49:51,850 --> 03:49:53,190
I can't believe how...

3440
03:49:57,330 --> 03:49:57,870
How...

3441
03:49:57,870 --> 03:49:59,550
Almost Metal Gear this is.

3442
03:50:00,210 --> 03:50:00,990
But it's a good time.

3443
03:50:00,990 --> 03:50:03,630
I hope you guys are enjoying it too.

3444
03:50:04,110 --> 03:50:08,450
It definitely does feel like Indiana Jones, which...

3445
03:50:08,450 --> 03:50:10,050
Of course is the best.

3446
03:50:10,870 --> 03:50:11,950
So, yeah.

3447
03:50:13,830 --> 03:50:17,730
I will see you guys whenever I see you next.

3448
03:50:18,390 --> 03:50:21,990
And I can read chat, but like only through...

3449
03:50:24,270 --> 03:50:25,260
Only through...

3450
03:50:26,130 --> 03:50:27,090
What's it called?

3451
03:50:27,450 --> 03:50:28,090
OBS.

3452
03:50:28,510 --> 03:50:30,050
So, it's been a little scuffed.

3453
03:50:30,050 --> 03:50:31,470
Thank you for the super chat.

3454
03:50:31,550 --> 03:50:33,690
I can't read it.

3455
03:50:33,790 --> 03:50:34,850
It says real talk.

3456
03:50:35,010 --> 03:50:35,310
Oh gosh.

3457
03:50:35,690 --> 03:50:37,470
See, this is why I switched to my mouse.

3458
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:42,270
And I can't go to... I can't... Let me just quit the game.

3459
03:50:46,270 --> 03:50:47,090
Bye game.

3460
03:50:48,850 --> 03:50:49,670
Bye game.

3461
03:50:50,090 --> 03:50:50,550
Bye game.

3462
03:50:50,650 --> 03:50:52,050
Can I leave the menu please?

3463
03:50:52,450 --> 03:50:52,810
Exit game.

3464
03:50:52,870 --> 03:50:53,450
Oh yeah, look.

3465
03:50:53,590 --> 03:50:54,870
This is really where I'm at.

3466
03:50:54,950 --> 03:50:55,590
That's so fun.

3467
03:50:56,290 --> 03:50:56,850
Exit game.

3468
03:50:57,850 --> 03:50:58,530
Exit game.

3469
03:50:58,610 --> 03:50:59,030
Exit game.

3470
03:50:59,130 --> 03:50:59,290
Okay.

3471
03:51:00,150 --> 03:51:01,170
We're good now.

3472
03:51:02,630 --> 03:51:04,830
Why is my chat always freezing?

3473
03:51:07,790 --> 03:51:08,270
One second.

3474
03:51:08,930 --> 03:51:09,390
One second.

3475
03:51:09,990 --> 03:51:10,630
I'll fix it.

3476
03:51:11,210 --> 03:51:11,830
I'll fix it.

3477
03:51:12,390 --> 03:51:13,430
I'll just be...

3478
03:51:14,690 --> 03:51:15,930
Big Minto now.

3479
03:51:17,230 --> 03:51:18,410
Thank you, Trine Princess!

3480
03:51:19,890 --> 03:51:20,670
Yeah, baby.

3481
03:51:31,950 --> 03:51:35,290
And I am going back to...

3482
03:51:36,170 --> 03:51:38,230
Live control room.

3483
03:51:43,430 --> 03:51:45,510
You make me spit out coffee.

3484
03:51:45,690 --> 03:51:45,990
No!

3485
03:51:46,090 --> 03:51:47,130
Don't spit out your coffee!

3486
03:51:48,290 --> 03:51:49,530
Make Minto bigger, please.

3487
03:51:51,550 --> 03:51:52,410
Here, actually.

3488
03:51:52,550 --> 03:51:53,190
Let me just do this.

3489
03:51:55,590 --> 03:51:56,210
There we go.

3490
03:51:57,930 --> 03:51:59,990
Thank you guys for the stream!

3491
03:52:00,210 --> 03:52:01,390
It was a lot of fun!

3492
03:52:01,670 --> 03:52:05,130
And I hope you're enjoying Indiana Jones!

3493
03:52:08,030 --> 03:52:09,030
How many murders?

3494
03:52:09,630 --> 03:52:12,610
21 murders, 5 deaths, 7 times cover blown so far.

3495
03:52:14,070 --> 03:52:16,430
That could be worse, you know?

3496
03:52:16,710 --> 03:52:18,250
But I'm having so much fun.

3497
03:52:18,270 --> 03:52:19,410
Even as a PNG, wiggle.

3498
03:52:21,190 --> 03:52:22,650
What did I just press?

3499
03:52:22,750 --> 03:52:23,050
I don't know.

3500
03:52:23,050 --> 03:52:23,790
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

3501
03:52:26,390 --> 03:52:26,830
I'm

3502
03:52:31,950 --> 03:52:32,290
having fun!

3503
03:52:32,570 --> 03:52:34,650
I'll see you guys next time I see you!

3504
03:52:34,930 --> 03:52:38,450
Otsubito, thank you for the fun Indiana Jones stream!

3505
03:52:42,050 --> 03:52:45,710
You can really see the love for the franchise the devs have.

3506
03:52:45,830 --> 03:52:48,090
Also, Faith Mo...Faith movie?

3507
03:52:48,590 --> 03:52:49,910
Faith movie?

3508
03:52:50,450 --> 03:52:51,250
No way!

3509
03:52:51,370 --> 03:52:53,870
Oh my god, you guys are going to have to watch it together!

3510
03:52:54,430 --> 03:52:55,210
No way!

3511
03:52:57,490 --> 03:52:58,670
That's so awesome!

3512
03:53:01,570 --> 03:53:02,450
Thank you!

3513
03:53:02,630 --> 03:53:03,790
Love the indie brain rot.

3514
03:53:03,890 --> 03:53:05,010
Indie brain rot.

3515
03:53:06,030 --> 03:53:07,430
This has been a lot of fun.

3516
03:53:07,630 --> 03:53:09,090
I've been having so much fun.

3517
03:53:09,290 --> 03:53:10,290
You want to watch it with us?

3518
03:53:10,690 --> 03:53:11,850
Of course I do!

3519
03:53:13,170 --> 03:53:14,450
That's our game!

3520
03:53:14,450 --> 03:53:19,490
Bye PNG... Bye bye!

3521
03:53:19,550 --> 03:53:19,890
Bye bye!

3522
03:53:19,970 --> 03:53:22,150
Bye bye!

3523
03:53:22,970 --> 03:53:23,990
I'll see you guys!

3524
03:53:24,310 --> 03:53:24,790
Otsubito!

3525
03:53:25,030 --> 03:53:25,510
Otsubito!

3526
03:53:26,750 --> 03:53:27,650
Bye bye!

3527
03:53:28,290 --> 03:53:28,970
Itadakimasu!

3528
03:53:31,510 --> 03:53:33,010
Like you can see the whole thing.

3529
03:53:35,330 --> 03:53:35,850
OK bye!

3530
03:53:37,590 --> 03:53:38,270
My

3531
03:54:26,770 --> 03:54:27,770
hat, the whole stream.

3532
03:54:30,810 --> 03:54:34,010
I didn't get to use my hat the entire stream.

3533
03:54:36,910 --> 03:54:38,610
It belongs in a museum.

3534
03:54:41,290 --> 03:54:43,370
I came to say goodbye to you guys.

3535
03:54:45,170 --> 03:54:48,390
I came to say goodbye to you, the viewer.

3536
03:54:49,390 --> 03:54:50,510
Thanks for watching!

3537
03:54:51,210 --> 03:54:51,810
Bye bye!
