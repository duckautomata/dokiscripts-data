1
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,350
You saw nothing.

2
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,300
What's she doing down there?

3
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,620
What's what's she peeking over the counter for?

4
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm shy.

5
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,960
Oh, I forgot music.

6
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,620
Hold on.

7
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,340
My music.

8
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,900
Music folder.

9
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,540
Wait, how loud is this?

10
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
How loud is this gonna be?

11
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Hold on.

12
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,090
Hold on.

13
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,960
What's the music to put on?

14
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,220
What's my mood?

15
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,420
Sleepy.

16
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,820
I think this might put me to sleep.

17
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,500
Hold on.

18
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,460
I have to put on something that's not going to...

19
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,380
Maybe this.

20
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,660

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,080
Matches.

82
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,160
Let's see.

83
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,560
Okay.

84
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:25,080
I've learned something on this trip in particular I've
learned something I said That I would stream a couple times

85
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:36,340
on my trip And I truly had every intention to do so I don't
just bring my laptop And my whole streaming setup Because

86
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:43,280
that stuff is so heavy I I Yeah, I was a filthy liar.

87
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,340
I'm so sorry.

88
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,860
That's why I almost put that in the thumbnail.

89
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,820
Like, this streamer lied to you.

90
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Sorry, I have still a bit of a cough.

91
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,720
How many times is it now that I've said that?

92
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,400
Well, okay, sometimes I do, though.

93
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,580
Another time.

94
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,260
I've learned, though.

95
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I've learned from this trip in particular.

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Oh, wait.

97
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,200
I just noticed something.

98
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
I forgot to put this on my mic.

99
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,400
Hold on.

100
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,960
It's gonna get kind of crunchy real quick.

101
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,580
There we go.

102
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,700
There we go.

103
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Sorry.

104
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah, I forgot to put the pop filter on.

105
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,570
Sorry.

106
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,970
That Twitter space still counts.

107
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,890
Does it?

108
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,430
Does it?

109
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,570
What was I saying?

110
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:04,450
Oh, I learned on this trip that And I've felt it in other
trips before, but this trip solidified it.

111
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:14,830
So in the past, I would go on trips to Japan and I would
still stream because I didn't do anything.

112
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,070
And I really didn't hang out with people.

113
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,810
I didn't really hang out with people.

114
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,910
I would kind of just go out and do my own thing.

115
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,950
And this time, I hung out with friends, like almost every
day.

116
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:41,730
and it kept me busy you did the collab with Leah too yeah
yeah I have stories to tell about that as well so when I go

117
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:51,890
out with friends I'm usually waking up like I want to stream
early in the morning because I want to you know do around my

118
00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:00,970
normal streaming time like now and this time if I'm staying
out with friends I'm waking up early and going out with

119
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:08,270
friends or I Or I am staying late and then I'm tired in the
morning.

120
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,550
I did get sick.

121
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:19,130
Yeah So I think I've learned that While this did turn into
work for me, it was like a it actually felt like a vacation

122
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,450
vacation It was kind of crazy.

123
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:31,730
There was I had plans like we all made plans and when I tell
you guys what it was going on you gonna be like how to why

124
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:40,530
you're gonna be like you guys are insane and I thought when
we were making these plans I was like something's gonna drop

125
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:56,790
like something we're gonna be like no we can't do that and
then we did everything and I was like why oh it was it was a

126
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:06,210
local streamer too popular too many friends I was my first
time really kind of going well I didn't go with everybody

127
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:17,770
but like this was like the largest group of people that I
had like hung out with maybe ever in Japan so I was like

128
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:32,930
whoa friends and there were people that wanted to see me and
I had to be like I'm sorry I can't I can't 32 people not

129
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:48,530
that many people close though close did any enemies into
friends no Why would I hang out with enemies?

130
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,690
But, no friends into enemies.

131
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,610
Which I think is even more impressive.

132
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,570
Because like when you travel with people, you know,
sometimes it's like, oh man, I hate that person now.

133
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,870
The way they brush their teeth annoys me.

134
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,890
The way they put on their socks annoys me.

135
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,090
The way they scratch their head annoys me.

136
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,550
You know?

137
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,610
Literally everything about them becomes a pain.

138
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:30,850
in your butt they're just living and you're like oh stop
living like that okay matara matara is like the only person

139
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,730
like that though she's a roach

140
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,960
but the first thing that we did that was crazy was everyone
was just like i i landed a little later than everyone that i

141
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,180
was hanging out with which i was hanging out with

142
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,000
And I was hanging out with Dustco.

143
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,320
I collabed with them.

144
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,000
And Oimo.

145
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,500
I hung out with Oimo.

146
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,360
We all collabed a couple days before I left.

147
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,880
And then...

148
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
And then we all went...

149
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,880
And we were hanging out in Japan together.

150
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,920
So that was a few people that I saw.

152
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,980
And...

153
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,700
living like that you say but with ghosts that does that
apply it does not it does not apply and so therefore you

154
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:44,620
cannot think that about me but let's see um uh so everybody
was like we're gonna go to Disney and that was like the day

155
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:54,040
after I got to Japan so I was like I'm probably not gonna do
that and i still did it

156
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,920
why why did i do that

157
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:19,660
it was peer pressure i sure they didn't even pressure me
they were like i think it was a fomo i think it It was FOMO!

158
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,300
Honestly!

159
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,500
I...

160
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
And I'll tell you, it was not worth it!

161
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
It was like...

162
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
It was...

163
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,800
It was... We rode three...

164
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,100
Okay, so I arrived Monday.

165
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,320
I arrived on a Monday that was a holiday in Japan.

166
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,780
And so I was like, well, that day would be so crowded at
Disney.

167
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,260
Tuesday will be fine!

168
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,480
Because everybody will have gone Monday.

169
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,280
And also, Tuesday is rainy.

170
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,100
It's cloudy.

171
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,900
It's ugly.

172
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,220
It's cold.

173
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,140
Nobody will go.

174
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, no.

175
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,660
I think everybody had the Mint Fanto mindset.

176
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,360
And rides were absolutely insanity.

177
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,580
Insanity.

178
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,040
There's one...

179
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm a bit of a freak about...

180
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,220
about amusement parks.

181
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,020
It's my niche.

182
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,520
And I have the Disney Park app.

183
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,180
In fact, I will check it right now.

184
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,480
And I will just check it occasionally because I'm bored.

185
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,460
I'll check the...

186
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,620
Just to see how long lines are.

187
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,480
So I have a pretty good gauge.

188
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,160
I have a pretty good gauge of, like, the average times.

189
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,160
of lines at amusement park sometimes.

190
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,480
Not wait.

191
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,660
What time is it in Japan?

192
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,300
Oh, okay, okay.

193
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
The park just opened.

194
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,540
Okay, it's 9.20 in Japan.

195
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,720
And because I saw one of the rides only had a 50-minute
wait.

196
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,100
It opened 20 minutes ago, by the way, and already has a
50-minute wait.

197
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,640
But that's very low for that ride, so I was like, whoa,
whoa, what's going on?

198
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:29,460
on they're flopping the park is closing yeah only 50 minute
wait yeah yeah yeah

199
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:51,880
but um but yeah so that's low that ride usually has like a
hundred and eighty minute wait one one 150 to 180 about yeah

200
00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:00,620
50 minute wait the place really fell off they're they're in
shambles nobody's going

201
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:13,810
holy hell you're telling me you're telling me um we got to
ride three rides My first time at Tokyo Disney was rainy,

202
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,550
but it still had fun.

203
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,350
My friend slipped and fell on Tom Sawyer's hat.

204
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,190
Oh, no!

205
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,970
Well, I usually, I don't usually check Disneyland, or Tokyo
Disneyland.

206
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,430
I usually check Tokyo Disney Sea.

207
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,710
That's like one of my favorite parks ever.

208
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,130
Uh, we got to, there's one ride called 20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea.

209
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:50,350
a 20 minute wait the weight when we went was 50 minutes it's
it's situations like that there's one ride called Sinbad

210
00:19:50,350 --> 00:20:01,730
that I have lovingly dubbed as all reliable because the ride
is amazing it's like a 15 minute ride it's it's it's bet

211
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,770
it's oh my god it's so good a one minute per one thousand
leaves

212
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:20,010
the best ride at Tokyo Disney Sea it's like 15 minutes long
it's a it's like it's a small world but the animatronics are

213
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:29,810
really impressive and the song is much better than it's a
small world it's the perfect dark water ride and the weight

214
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:43,570
is always always at five minutes it's all reliable if you
can't ride literally anything at Tokyo Disney Sea Sinbad has

215
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:53,430
your back and I was convincing everybody I was like you guys
we have to go on Sinbad it's all reliable if you're tired

216
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:04,630
get on Sinbad you can ride nearly immediately you can just
go on the ride sit for for 15 minutes you have you have a

217
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,890
great experience I think I'm exaggerating about the time.

218
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,330
But still, it's really long.

219
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,630
You think the ride is over and then it keeps going.

220
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,650
It's great.

221
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,130
It's so awesome.

222
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,050
Sinbad, five minutes.

223
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,470
You know how I know that the times were bad?

224
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,110
15 minute wait.

225
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,430
15 minute wait for my old reliable.

226
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,830
It's... That's how you know.

227
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,970
That's how you know things are in dire states.

228
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,050
It's over.

229
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,110
It's three times.

230
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,570
I know!

231
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,830
I have never once seen the queue of this ride.

232
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,710
Never once have I seen the queue of this ride except when I
went.

233
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,710
Except that day.

234
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,550
I was like, I was like, whoa.

235
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,010
There's decorations!

236
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,460
Yeah, and then we went on...

237
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,540
We went on my favorite ride at the park, which was Journey
to the Center of the Earth.

238
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,920
It's so great.

239
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,600
Oh, sorry.

240
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,120
Oh, sorry.

241
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm kidding.

242
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,100
I saw someone ask if I am a screamer or stoic on roller
coasters.

243
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm more like this.

244
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,660
The whole time, I'm just like...

245
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,460
But nothing is coming out of my mouth.

246
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,320
I'll just be like...

247
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,690
Because I'm having fun.

248
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,950
I'm not like...

249
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,390
And sometimes I'll go...

250
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,690
Woo!

251
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,530
But I wouldn't say I'm stoic in like a...

252
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,830
Like I'm still enjoying myself.

253
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,430
journey to the center of the earth was my favorite ride
there too it's um oh my gosh it's a Tokyo Disney Sea

254
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:33,930
exclusive ride so I recommend it if even if you don't like
roller coasters there's one drop it's a little steep I'll

255
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:44,410
give it that but it is it is just a really awesome ride I I
rant and It's so good.

256
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,390
It's so...

257
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,270
It's... Oh, I really can't just...

258
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,870
Is that the three-hour one?

259
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,230
Yeah.

260
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,250
It is the three-hour one.

261
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,350
But it's such a great ride.

262
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,930
Apparently with family to visit Disney World and Universal.

263

know exactly what that is yeah you see maximus the horse and

289
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:14,470

along the tree on one part.

290
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,310
She's like flying through the tree with her hair.

291
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,710
And Eugene is like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,210
This stupid girl.

293
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,110
Then you see the snuggly duckling.

294
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,350
You only see it.

295
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,350
You don't go inside.

296
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:35,970
Then the next room, you, uh, is Rapunzel healing Flynn's
hand, Flynn Rider's hand with her hair?

297
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:51,350
And then the next room is them singing At last I see the
light In a boat, which is so beautiful And you circle around

298
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,750
them and then the ride's over

299
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,150
Is it TLDR of the movie?

300
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,230
No, not even

301
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,240
I've waited two and a half hours for that

302
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,710
In the freezing cold It rained a little bit.

303
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,320
It was so...

304
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,740
I mean, again, it's so beautiful.

305
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,260
That part alone is so nice.

306
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,820
But what I also think they really do you dirty.

307
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,960
They do you dirty is your circling...

308
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,340
Here, let me see if I can find a picture.

309
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,300
At least.

310
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,680
Tangled Ride.

311
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,700
Tokyo Disney Sea.

312
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,340
It's so messed up.

313
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,580
Okay.

314
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,140
Seeing this pisses me off.

315
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,120
This ride makes me so angry.

316
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,040
I wonder if I look up like a...

317
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,580
I went on the Tangled Ride.

318
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,840
This is how long it took.

319
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,540
Tangled Ride, Tokyo Disney.

320
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,660
Let's see how long the video is.

321
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,080
Five minutes?

322
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,580
No, it's not even.

323
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,340
Maybe five minute long.

324
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:11,880
Maybe.

325
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,200
Maybe.

326
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I don't know.

327
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,780
It's...

328
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,140
And what sucks is I love Tangled.

329
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,100
Okay, this is what the room looks like.

330
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,740
It's gorgeous, no?

331
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,380
It's so beautiful.

332
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,440
They're singing the song and the animatronics look amazing.

333
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,000
It literally looks like the scene from the movie taken out
and put into this room.

334
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,420
It's really awesome.

335
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,480
But you see, hold on, let me get a pointer.

336
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,660
Let me get a pointer.

337
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,420
Let me get a pointer.

338
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,180
Uh...

339
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,980
Do I have a little mouse somewhere?

340
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,120
Hold on.

341
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,360
Uh...

342
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,380
Let me use...

343
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,220
No, he's not a PNG.

344
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,200
Um...

345
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,140
It's awesome.

346
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,860
I know!

347
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,780
It's...

348
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,620
So pretty!

349
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,120
Why don't I have a pointer?

350
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,100
Okay, I'm gonna use this guy.

351
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,080
Actually, no, I'm gonna use... Okay.

352
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,300
The little...

353
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,320
The little, this, the wispy part.

354
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,880
Like, look at the top of the head, okay?

355
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,700
You see the carts down here?

356
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,120
They go around like this.

357
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
So you get a full angle, like a full view of them singing.

358
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,840
And it's very cute and romantic and beautiful.

359
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
But imagine me.

360
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
I'm sitting right here, okay?

361
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,380
I'm sitting right here.

362
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,760
There's a car right over here, right?

363
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,180
There's me.

364
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,560
Sobbing.

365
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,100
Crying.

366
00:30:46,360 --> 00:31:02,380
tears streaming down my face I'm like and then there's
people over there looking at me they can see everything

367
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:14,540
and then also I'm here trying to get every beautiful angle
of Rapunzel's cute little face and who do I have in the

368
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:29,440
background some OG sign some some little child in the
background who's pogging being like the entire time get out

369
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,520
of my shot

370
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:51,000
that's my besides the length of the ride that is my biggest
complaint because here I I am desperately, desperately

371
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,720
trying to wipe tears from my face so that nobody can see me.

372
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,840
Do you watch the Funkland?

373
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,700
Of course I watched the Funkland.

374
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
But I haven't watched the new video.

375
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,400
I haven't had time.

376
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,220
Do not perceive Minto.

377
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,720
It's so embarrassing.

378
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,020
It's so embarrassing.

379
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,620
Is there news with our fan name?

380
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,260
No.

381
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
Don't ask.

382
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,340
Ask!

383
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,500
We're working on it!

384
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,000
It's a work in progress!

385
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,840
But yeah, so that was literally my first day at Disney.

386
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,140
Sorry to rant about.

387
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,220
Sorry to rant about so much of it.

388
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:51,820
Oh.

389
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,900
Let's see.

390
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,440
Um, after that, uh, the day after, I went to some tea.

391
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,600
I went to Tay with my friends.

392
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,100
Oh, I also went shopping with Dust Go.

393
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,160
I helped her pick out some stuff.

394
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,740
So, um, it was crazy.

395
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,960
New Epcot Fireworks Show Mashes Up Remember Me and She Loved
Me.

396
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,600
No.

397
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,320
That's messed up.

398
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,400
Oh my gosh, Dan, thank you so much for that.

399
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,960
For after, thank you.

400
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,640
I don't want to talk about fan names right now.

401
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,660
Thank you, though.

402
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,410
Do I like GU clothing?

403
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:39,910
Yeah!

404
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:45,390
I like GU, which is kind of strange that they're only in
Japan because they're Uniqlo.

405
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,350
I feel like they could expand internationally just like
Uniqlo did, no?

406
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,170
So...

407
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,150
Hmm...

408
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,650
I don't know, I don't know.

409
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,790
There's one in New York now.

410
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,430
Ah, see?

411
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,650
There are GU in the US.

412
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,170
They're in Taiwan too.

413
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,830
Oh, see?

414
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,270
So, yeah.

415
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,570
And then, let's see.

416
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:21,910
Then, the day after, I went to an idol event.

417
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:30,750
And I got to see an idol, and she was like, she was like,
Chad?

418
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,530
Why are you here?

419
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,270
My... You guys, my gotcha luck has been insane!

420
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,110
Insane!

421
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,590
This...

422
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,850
This... this... this trip...

423
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,870

424
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,390
I know!

425
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,530
She's so sweet.

426
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,030
I actually got to meet her at the Toho Lost Word...

427
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,050
Uh, Toho Lost Word event.

428
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,630
And so I was like really happy she remembered me.

429
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:08,270
And then she was like I've been wanting to message you but
I'm so shy and I was like me too I've been wanting to

430
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:22,630

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:32,470
retiring next year she's been having some she was a member

433
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:49,690
And she left the groups, well yeah she left the groups and
then she's been doing kind of like solo activities and stuff

434
00:35:50,290 --> 00:36:03,050
and then and next year she's retiring like from
entertainment so I'm like So I was like, I have to go see

435
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,810
her as many times as possible now.

436
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,950
So I really wanted to make it out to this event.

437
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,910
And this event was gotcha.

438
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,650
It was lottery.

439
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,470
And it's a very small venue.

440
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,950
So I was really happy that I could go see her.

441
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,850
I was so happy.

442
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,350
That was one thing of my good gotcha.

443
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,090
But the other thing was, I went with Vicky.

444
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,650
Vicky and I were there together.

445
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:38,750
like Nemo had these like decorated checky cases that she
made herself and she was like if you want one you have to

446
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:52,470
rock paper scissors for it um it's kind of funny you had to
rock paper scissors for it to then pay for it is Vicky's

447
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:58,970
gotcha luck contagious or did you absorb all her luck I
don't know maybe maybe I absorbed her luck or something

448
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:07,490
because what it happened was there were hold on I took a
picture there were six of them there were six of them and

449
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:19,030
everybody did rock paper scissors and Vicki won one she won

Wait, 6 or 7?

480
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,940
I will kill you myself.

481
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,240
I will- shut up.

482
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,260
Shut up!

483
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,190
I am-

484
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,350
It's not funny!

485
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,890
Stop trying to make fetch a thing!

486
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,210
That's what you guys sound like.

487
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,760
Please!

488
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,850
You are so millennial.

489
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,710
Nah, you guys are so stupid!

490
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,630
I don't make millennial jokes, at least.

491
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,410
Well, yeah, I do.

492
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:19,990
Do I?

493
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,930
I don't know.

494
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,310
Also, it's all the millennials that are making the jokes,
too.

495
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,110
Everybody's adopting 6-7.

496
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,790
Don't say I'm a millennial, just because...

497
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,890
Yeah, you could say I'm Boomer.

498
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm drinking tea right now, so I have some caffeine in me.

499
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,680
Okay, boomer.

500
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,500
Yeah, I'm a boomer.

501
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,800
Use code boomer for...

502
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,080
What is it?

503
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,980
How much...

504
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,720
A number off your gamer subs?

505
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,800
Use code boomer for...

506
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,720
10% off gamer subs.

507
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,200
Thank you.

508
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:25,980
some amount did you guys see that picture that was like an
ad for a sponge bop game that was like mr.

509
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:38,600
crabs holding up the sign and it says the game is 67% off
but the catch was the the picture was ai generated right and

510
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:47,620
what's funny is people were like you don't even need to show
me the the weird artifacting in the image for me to know

511
00:41:47,620 --> 00:42:03,440
that this is ai generated because there's no way that mr
crabs would be excited about a discount that that is of his

512
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
own product

513
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,500
mr crabs could never be happy

514
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,740
I went to Fujiqu!

515
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,360
It was so cold.

516
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,500
Holy moly!

517
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,480
Was it cold?

518
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,520
But it was so beautiful.

519
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,840
I think the best days to go to Fujiqu are the cold days.

520
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:47,180
Because typically like the sun, it's like, you know how like
a cold, crisp day is is like where the sun is out and

521
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,240
there's no clouds in the sky.

522
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,180
And it was just so, woo!

523
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,140
Did you take any pics?

524
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,800
I took a ton of pics, but I'm kind of lazy to get them off
my phone.

525
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,460
I haven't gone through them to make sure they're safe too,
some of these.

526
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,420
But I love Fujikyu.

527
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:14,860
It's probably my favorite theme park because the rides are
insane.

528
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,800
The rides are insane.

529
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,300
The roller coasters are actually crazy.

530
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:33,700
thrill rides it's so the not safe for work theme park face
oh yeah I do have a close up picture of Tsunade's boobies

531
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,580
because there's a little Naruto park

532
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:50,760
yeah oh my gosh you guys oh my gosh you guys eh janaika is
crazy eh janaika eh janaika eh janaika here I'll show you

533
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,380
guys that picture Hold on.

534
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,340
That's just one picture I can upload.

535
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,600
Unfortunately, though, we didn't get to ride Takashiba
because by the end of the day, it was so cold and we were so

536
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,300
tired.

537
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,080
But, what is it?

538
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh my gosh.

539
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,200
Fujiyama is like one of my favorite roller coasters of all
time.

540
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,620
It's so long and the drops are so crazy.

541
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,760
And it's so much fun.

542
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,400
I love it.

543
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,160
I love, love, love it.

544
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,120
Wait, hold on.

545
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,020
Where's her boobs?

546
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,460
Boobies!

547
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,280
Where are you?

548
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,760
Where are you?

549
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,880
Where are you?

550
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,140
Where are you?

551
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,060
Where are you?

552
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Um...

553
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,440
Um...

554
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,780
Because...

555
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,140
Yeah, we went on...

556
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,560
There's a new ride, too, called Zokon, that I got to ride.

557
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,660
It was pretty funny because we were like seeing it from the
outside and we were like...

558
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,560
We were like...

559
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,880
This ride looks not so intense.

560
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,680
Like it looks pretty slow.

561
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,040
It's like a... It's like a bike style.

562
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,780
So...

563
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,120
So... Shut up.

564
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,360
Why are you guys like this today?

565
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,100
Shut up!

566
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,350
We're making it for the most time.

567
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,520
Oh my gosh, I just realized there's like a crack on the
statue.

568
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,120
Welcome back, Min.

569
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Thank you.

570
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:51,810
Home.

571
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:53,550
Um.

572
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,830
Here's the picture.

573
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,010
Whoa!

574
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:57,690
It's big.

575
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:58,810
Hold on.

576
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,690
Fit to screen.

577
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,190
There we go.

578
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,990
You're welcome.

579
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,490
You're welcome.

580
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,590
I think they nerfed her, honestly.

581
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,650
I think they're bigger.

582
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:30,210
In the show no you sound like boobies is a pet name of a pet
you but yeah zokan end of end of ride name nothing else

583
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:42,930
following she's low on chagra uh zokan we were looking at it
we're like this doesn't seem very fast and but there were

584
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:55,310
signs leading up to it that were like they were like this
ride is more intense then then you think this ride is more

585
00:46:55,310 --> 00:47:06,390
extreme then then you realize and like everything was very
much like do not do not take your hands off the handlebar do

586
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:16,070
not like place like make sure your back is like this like
all this stuff and I was like what the heck this is kind of

587
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:26,570
crazy but but the show they were almost as big as her head
oh crazy

588
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:39,540
but then when you get on the ride it actually was really I
thought I was gonna slip out of my seat I'm not gonna I'm

589
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:47,280
not gonna lie did you ride Ejanaika yeah of course I rode
Ejanaika there is not a roller coaster that I will not ride

590
00:47:48,320 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker you guys I'm a bit of a
thrill-seeker so um the ride was kind of insane actually it

591
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:08,120
was super and then they were also because it was like a bike
style they were like when you were turning lean into the

592
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:18,000
turns things like that so it was pretty cool I was it was
pretty neat Ejj and Nyka is really fun.

593
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:26,820
The only thing that I have an issue with it is one thing
that I love about roller coasters is that pit feeling in

594
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,420
your stomach when you drop.

595
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,420
And the way that Ej and Nyka works is essentially they send
you up the ride backwards.

596
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,280
Thank you so much.

597
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,700
We're like, I have to attack you.

598
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:57,200
the ride backwards but then the ride how do i even explain
this it flips you around while you are like on the ride like

599
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:08,880
it's turning there they advertise like 14 rotations or
something yeah i love airtime give me all the airtime

600
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,660
everything i love it i love it

601
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,080
So, you don't really like feel...

602
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,140
You just are so disoriented the whole time.

603
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,120
It's kind of fun, though.

604
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,500
I went on the Kidney Stone roller coaster.

605
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,740
One's 10 out of 10.

606
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,680
Uh...

607
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,640
Big Thunder Mountain?

608
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,280
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

609
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,140
So, it's...

610
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,360
It's...

611
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
It's less barf-inducing than it seems.

612
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,620
I don't know.

613
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,520
It's kind of crazy.

614
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,560
Hey, Sparta!

615
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,480
Happy birthday!

616
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,360
But yeah...

617
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,920
It's crazy!

618
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,500
It's a lot of fun though.

619
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,270
We went in the haunted house.

620
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,730
That was fun.

621
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,470
We got yelled at though, by the...

622
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,670
Okay, there were like...

623
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,590
Character actors, right?

624
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,090
Like in the haunted house.

625
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,370
We were walking by!

626
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,450
And like, they were like, it was like a small little...

627
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,270
A small little hallway.

628
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,070
And we were like pressed against the wall.

629
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,750
And we were like talking to them.

630
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,770
We were like, Año!

631
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,850
Año, tell me my name!

632
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,630
You know, like being stupid people.

633
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,370
Because like, we weren't heckling them or anything.

634
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,390
We weren't like, ooh, you suck!

635
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,190
We weren't doing anything bad.

636
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,370
We were just kind of like, Año!

637
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,750
Don't hurt us, don't scare us, please!

638
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,130
We're just stupid foreigners!

639
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,090
Hehehehehe!

640
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,830
And then they like looked up at us.

641
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:55,630
and broke character and they were like don't act like that
towards the actors please follow the rules and then walked

642
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:11,790
away and we were like oh was that part of the we were like
we were like was that part of that it was kind of scary that

643
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:21,370
was the scariest part that was the scariest part of the
haunted house It was kind of, like they were like, Chanto,

644
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,650
Ruru, A Momote Kutasai.

645
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,050
And then like walked away.

646
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,490
It was so scary!

647
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,410
That would have ruined my day.

648
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:33,130
Honestly, like, it was towards the beginning of the haunted
house.

649
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,150
And if you know the haunted house at Fujikyu, it's about
like 30 to 40 minutes long.

650
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,790
It's quite long.

651
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,830
And...

652
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,650
Oh my gosh, that's how well thank you so much.

653
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,370
Thank you!

654
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:53,070
The fact that they were like, I was like, Oh my gosh.

655
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,050
Like, please follow the rules.

656
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,170
Remember the rules.

657
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,710
That was so scary.

658
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:06,170
It felt, it did kind of like put a damper on our mood, but
we were fine afterwards.

659
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,950
It was just kind of like, dang, okay.

660
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,470
I was like, what are we supposed to do?

661
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,390
Why do we?

662
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,470
Why are they so mad?

663
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,770
Like, I thought everybody would kind of be like, well, we
didn't touch them at all, of course.

664
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,770
I guess they were upset that we were, like, talking to them.

665
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,170
I have no idea what the rule was.

666
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,930
Fun is banned.

667
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,630
Japan is kind of, like, weird like that sometimes about
certain things.

668
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,770
I don't know.

669
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,710
It was so strange.

670
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,990
It was really, yeah.

671
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,830
But, you know, we just kind of kept going.

672
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:59,430
and didn't let it let it get to us too much but it was it
was i'm never i never have it's had something like that

673
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:08,610
happened to me before so i was like what the huh i don't
know

674
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:25,330
do not have fun outside of funds approved fun zones yeah so
i guess be careful if you go to the to the haunted house in

675
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:37,470
Fujikyu because they'll be like don't talk to them I guess I
don't know I'm like really bad I'm like such a I'm such a

676
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:43,550
little wimpy baby where it's just like if I break the rules
I'm like I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and then right now

677
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:52,130
like there's like pretty bad foreigner sentiment in Japan so
I always try to be like very I'm like I'm like respectful

678
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:58,590
you know because I'm like I don't want that I don't want
them to think like that like all foreigners are bad you know

679
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:08,670
things like that so I'm very like you know so I was just
like what the heck oh my gosh I didn't expect it but it

680
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:19,550
didn't it didn't ruin our time at all it was just very
shocking and uh uh then we went on this one oh my gosh me

681
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:29,750
and Vogel we were on this swing ride that like takes you
super duper um high in the air if you sing 24 hours

682
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:37,370
cinderella in your next karaoke i'll be my wish you forever
i've been meaning to learn it i gotta learn it but the swing

683
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:44,630
ride takes you super duper it's one of those like rides that
like spins you around kind of right um and it takes you

684
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:53,210
really really high up and it was like the best view of
Fujisan, it was so beautiful, but it was freezing.

685
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,330
It was so cold.

686
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:04,490
And there was like a part where like you would be against
the wind, like you would be rather like the wind wouldn't

687
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:10,710
hit you until you only reached a certain area of the swing.

688
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,110
And so Mogu and I would be like,

689
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,630
every time.

690
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,010
It was so bad.

691
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,480
I would just be like, Vogue!

692
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,040
Vogue!

693
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,120
What are we doing up here?

694
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,730
It was so...

695
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:46,590
They've become very extremely strict, I've noticed, on
rides.

696
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,170
Especially Fujikil.

697
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,770
Essentially, somebody...

698
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,450
I think somebody died.

699
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,730
They, like, broke their back on a ride.

700
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,470
That ride is now decommissioned.

701
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,210
But I think ever since then they've been super like...

702
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,530
No, nothing, no this, no that.

703
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,490
So like...

704
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,030
I really wanted to bring my phone.

705
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,950
You know how parks, like amusement parks in the States?

706
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,190
They don't care at all.

707
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,310
They're like, you drop your phone, goodbye forever.

708
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:25,230
But here they're just like, um, you know, you could drop
your phone and your belongings, but, um, and we can't get

709
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,190
them back for you if that...

710
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,890
happens, but also, we're going to scan you.

711
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:37,210
We're going to make sure, we're going to check your pockets
to make sure you have nothing in there.

712
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:40,970
You can bring literally nothing onto this ride.

713
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:50,490
My friend had, had trash, literal like a receipt trash in,
in, in, in the pocket.

714
00:56:51,890 --> 00:57:02,270
And, and the, attendant was like no you have to you have to
take that out and go put it in the locker and then and make

715
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:19,130
them and it was crazy I was like trash a receipt a literal
receipt paper paper and they made her go back through and

716
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:28,790
like took us a wand and wand and wand their pants again i
was like this is insane this is so

717
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:39,070
like you i wanted to bring my phone for the for the swing
but because i wanted to take nice video of mount fuji no not

718
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:48,130
even possible the paper is a choking hazard yeah i
understand phones especially because if like that happens to

719
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:55,250
land on the track that's a huge issue Or, you know, if it
drops, like, that's obviously...

720
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,630
That sucks, but my god!

721
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,610
Not having anything in your pockets at all!

722
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:03,890
Is insane!

723
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,170
Falls on someone's head.

724
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,210
Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

725
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,310
If it falls on someone's head, yeah.

726
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:17,970
Anything falling out of your pockets that would fall on your
head is, of course, extremely dangerous as well.

727
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,210
What food did I eat over there?

728
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:22,130
Oh my gosh, so much!

729
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,230
I ate a ton.

730
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,250
I ate so much sushi though.

731
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,310
I'm addicted to sushi though.

732
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,410
I'm addicted to sushi though.

733
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,970
What made you throw up?

734
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:43,690
I'm getting there.

735
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,470
I'm getting there.

736
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:46,550
Don't worry.

737
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,890
Hamazushi better?

738
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:52,230
No.

739
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,830
No, no, no!

740
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,370
Also, there's less hamazushi than there is sushi though,
first of all.

741
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:03,230
I will say though better than, better than kurazushi.

742
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,270
Kurazushi.

743
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:07,810
But...

744
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,430
Um...

745
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,810
Sushiro has the salmon basil...

746
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,590
Salmon basil pesto roll.

747
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,730
And it's like the best thing ever.

748
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,410
I say roll, it's a nigiri, but it's so...

749
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,110
Good!

750
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,410
Did you get all the Miko-chi collab stuff?

751
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,310
I saw it, but I did not get anything.

752
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,810
So yummy.

753
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:40,810
So yummy!

754
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,030
Welcome back, Minto!

755
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:42,770
Thank you!

756
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:43,690
Thank you!

757
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,450
Yeah, that basil sushi?

758
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,790
You guys, it's so good!

759
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,410
It's so good!

760
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,670
Gosh, it's so delicious.

761
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,510
For business purposes, you appreciate all sushi chains.

762
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,130
Yes, I appreciate all sushi chains for business purposes.

763
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:07,310
Let's see, though.

764
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,330
So Fujikil was a lot of fun, but of course it was extremely
busy.

765
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,530
It was an extremely long day because they get there very
early.

766
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,150
But what's crazy is I didn't realize this.

767
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,310
The park closes at 6 p.m.

768
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,470
6 p.m.

769
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,730
So, I've never heard of a park closing so early.

770
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,350
I was like, wait, really?

771
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,230
Am I getting this wrong?

772
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,850
Yeah.

773
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,670
Super duper early.

774
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,770
Oh my gosh, thank you for the sushi fun.

775
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:40,570
Thank you.

776
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,350
Yeah.

777
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,750
Was that when it started getting dark?

778
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,650
It is.

779
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,390
But I like, you know, I guess I really love Fujikyu for the
view of Mount Fuji.

780
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:57,150
But I also love it for the ride.

781
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,570
So I was just so...

782
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,510
That's why, yeah, you need to get there early.

783
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,730
Otherwise, you'll miss the entire park.

784
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,970
So that was fun.

785
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,410
Oh my gosh, one thing you guys asked about Mikuchi Sushiro.

786
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,150
But one thing that was also happening was Roboko-san.

787
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:22,390
Roboko-san was doing a collab at Kier-Made Cafe.

788
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,030
So I did get to go to that.

789
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:29,970
Yeah, actually I think that was the only maid cafe I got to
be able to make it out to.

790
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,410
But she had like... hold on, I have a picture.

791
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:35,810
It's really cute.

792
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:36,330
Hold on.

793
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:37,450
Let me...

794
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:37,750
Oh, wait.

795
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:38,470
Oh gosh.

796
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,830
Uploading pictures to Discord mobile sucks.

797
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:45,650
Hold on.

798
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,350
I have to like scroll through.

799
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,550
Wait, where is it?

800
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:48,810
Huh?

801
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,390
Oh, hold on.

802
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,690
Wait, oh, I can do multiple.

803
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,550
Okay, okay.

804
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,030
Good, good, good.

805
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,490
Wait, let me double check that this one's okay.

806
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,490
The food was yummy, though.

807
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,950
It was very cute and so yummy.

808
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,790
Double checking, double checking.

809
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:12,410
Looks.

810
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,470
Looks.

811
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,710
I have to crop this man out.

812
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:22,090
Sorry.

813
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,250
I didn't realize he was in my picture.

814
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,010
I didn't crop any of these.

815
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:31,530
Sorry.

816
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,750
Let me crop this man out.

817
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,470
The art form was so good.

818
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,150
It was so, so cute.

819
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,430
OG San begun, yeah.

820
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,910
OG San eraser.

821
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,010
Erase.

822
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,310
A little bit more.

823
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:54,510
Erase!

824
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:54,870
Okay.

825
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,630
You can see his fingers.

826
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,390
I'm so sorry.

827
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,870
Um, so this was...

828
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,210
The food I got.

829
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,530
That's a stew.

830
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,710
That's a... Hold on.

831
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,130
It's like a... It was like a...

832
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,150
Chicken stew.

833
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,930
Um, I love the gears.

834
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,630
I thought they were super, super cute.

835
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,830
You see how many little gear pastas there are?

836
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,270
Exactly three.

837
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,170
Yeah, that's all I got.

838
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,010
That's all that was in there.

839
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:32,650
Yeah.

840
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,570
Exactly.

841
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:39,190
They were like, yeah.

842
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:50,190
And then the parfait was like a sesame pudding and then a
peach drink, which was very good.

843
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,590
Peach, wait, was it peach?

844
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,490
I can't remember.

845
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,030
But look at this.

846
01:03:58,730 --> 01:03:59,790
Look at this.

847
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:00,110
Da!

848
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,030
Look!

849
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,580
It's me!

850
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,480
In the Curavade Cafe.

851
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,200
Enjoying.

852
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,200
The collab.

853
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:14,700
Yeah.

854
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,540
What kind of ice cream?

855
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,660
I think it was a strawberry ice cream on top.

856
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,100
And I remember the tea was not...

857
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,060
It was not sweetened at all.

858
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,700
See?

859
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,860
So, the ice cream really sweetened it well.

860
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,640
It was nice.

861
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,880
That's me in the maid cafe.

862
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,280
Yeah.

863
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,280
Yeah.

864
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,440
Awesome, I know.

865
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,020
Yeah.

866
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,260
And then there was a...

867
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,580
In the same building, in the Onoden building, there's like a
downstairs area.

868
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,620
And they had... Look at this screen!

869
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,820
Oh, you see that guy's fingers.

01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:48,440
Oh, no.

871
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,460
Don't sue me.

872
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,980
Look at this screen!

873
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,360
And they had like all the artwork and stuff.

something really funny to say about this.

879
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,080
She invited me.

880
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,200
She invited me quite a bit ago.

881
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,240
Luckily, my date just happened to overlap.

882
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,960
It was like pure coincidence.

883
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:24,280
I was like, oh my gosh, thank goodness I don't have to go
back to Japan for, you know, like it was really lucky

884
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:24,840
timing.

885
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,500
I got me minto blush this weekend.

886
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,180
Thank you.

887
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:29,900
Thank you.

888
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,480
Thank you.

889
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,300
Did you go to Chikawa Park?

890
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:34,700
No!

891
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,820
I'm not super into Chikawa, so I didn't go.

892
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,120
Um, I just like it, but I'm not like a super duper fan.

893
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,160
Um, Leah did such a good job in her 3D.

894
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:48,820
She did!

895
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,740
She did!

896
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:50,940
Yeah!

897
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,400
Um, but...

898
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,700
Do I have a favorite Chikawa?

899
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,660
I like Momonga!

900
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:11,140
But anyway, Leah invited me and I was like, sure, of course.

901
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:17,640
And then I saw that they announced their 3D debuts and I was
like, oh, cool.

902
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:32,860
I guess, I guess like she'll announce because usually, okay,
I've always, or not always, but like, usually things that I

903
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:37,040
participate in are like filmed and recorded in advance,
right?

904
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:48,060
So I was like, okay, um, I guess maybe she'll have her 3D
debut, and I thought for some reason that the thing, that I

905
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,520
was going to be a part of, was her birthday.

906
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:03,760
And so I was like, oh, she might announce her birthday thing
that I'll be a part of during the 3D debut.

907
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,680
I get there.

908
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,700
We're practicing and setting up.

909
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,780
And then she was just like, okay, so for tomorrow.

910
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,300
And I was like, huh?

911
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:23,820
Tomorrow?

912
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:28,880
Wait, what?

913
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,410
And then she was like, yeah, it's live.

914
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,470
And I was like...

915
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,100
And guys, oh my god, I was so...

916
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,100
This is when I was really sick.

917
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,700
Luckily I wasn't like...

918
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,960
I didn't have like super sickness, but for like a cold I was
pretty sick.

919
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,020
Check the JLPT.

920
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,840
Oh my gosh, good luck!

921
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,340
Good luck, good luck.

922
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:10,120
When I was doing that dance, my vision was like...

923
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,320
I don't know how I got through it.

924
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:15,460
I...

925
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,340
I had taken some medicine right before.

926
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,700
And, like, my vision was, like, going in and out.

927
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,380
It was so bad.

928
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,220
I'm glad that we talked before and then did the dance.

929
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,440
Because I was, like...

930
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,380
I was like, oh, my God.

931
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,780
This is so bad.

932
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,460
And I...

933
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,980
I messed up!

934
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,880
But luckily, the camera would cut.

935
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,020
And I was like, I got so lucky.

936
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,580
I thought I was literally gonna pass out.

937
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,400
Wouldn't that have been so bad if I passed out?

938
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,610
If I passed out...

939
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,390
Like live?

940
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:14,590
In somebody else's 3D day...

941
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:31,500
view that would have been so bad well imagine all like the
clips of me falling and just being like wasted it

942
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:52,640
would have been so embarrassing so but I it was funny um
when i was like practicing with her um

943
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:10,060
sakana this didn't tell me the right time i was i was there
at noon and i was like okay i'm here i'm ready and then he

944
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:20,980
was like huh he was like um i'm far away i was like what do
you mean by that he was like oh nobody told you the updated

945
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:35,260
time yeah nobody told me the updated time i even got there
early i was there like i was there like 15 minutes early

946
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:43,080
because i was like i'm gonna be responsible she's probably
already like practicing so hard and everything so

947
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,950
It was good though.

948
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,670
It's fine.

949
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:59,390
We made him go to the convenience and buy us snacks.

950
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:05,410
And I made him get me an Uber home.

951
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:09,570
Yeah.

952
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:11,090
Yeah.

953
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:15,190
I was like, um.

954
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:19,690
Give me.

955
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,030
Nah, he offered, actually.

956
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,810
I was like, I'm looking for a taxi now.

957
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,750
And he was like, oh, do you want me to call you one?

958
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:32,700
Yeah.

959
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,660
So that was good.

960
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,580
And, um...

961
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,020
Yeah.

962
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,380
So...

963
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,680
Let's see.

964
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,700
Didn't you get banned from Uber?

965
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,240
Yeah, I'm banned from Uber.

966
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,360
I can't...

967
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,180
I can't use Uber in Japan.

968
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,740
It's because I can't...

969
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,200
I can't...

970
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,020
I can't call.

971
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,900
I can't have an account for some reason.

972
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,260
And it sucks because there's also like a Go Taxi app.

973
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,980
And for some reason it won't accept my card.

974
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,900
So I can't like call a taxi there.

975
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,620
I always have to like manually go into the street and find a
taxi.

976
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,090
So I can't.

977
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,600
I have no idea what I do.

978
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:25,960
I did.

979
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,380
I've already talked about this, but no.

980
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,800
For those that don't know, I've been banned from Uber.

981
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,740
I don't know why.

982
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,120
I only used it a couple times before they banned me.

983
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:45,980
I think, though, it was because I, back in the day, I had
heard that Uber drivers do not, or like, I guess, not just

984
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:55,600
Uber drivers, but, um, like, the shared, shared rider,
shared drivers, they don't like you to drive drivers.

985
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:06,160
amount of distances and it happened right after anime expo
and my hotel was not far away but it was just close enough

986
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:15,020
that it was like a five-minute drive so I would keep
requesting ubers back and forth because I was not going to

987
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:26,880
walk by myself in the downtowns of LA so I think maybe maybe
they got mad at me and Maybe they gave me a bunch of

988
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,960
one-star reviews because I kept asking for short trips.

989
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,460
I heard that they don't like short trips for some reason.

990
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:35,980
I don't get it.

991
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,000
What else was I supposed to do, though?

992
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,100
I can't walk.

993
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,800
Mint has never been to Uvu Java.

994
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,320
They don't like money?

995
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,020
I guess not.

996
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,420
And I tip.

997
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,180
I tip by drivers.

998
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,360
And sometimes people will be like, wow, you're tipping.

999
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,280
Like, people don't tip anymore.

1000
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,020
I'm like, what?

1001
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:04,980
I tip.

1002
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,660
Uber driver here.

1003
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,280
It was me.

1004
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,000
I did it.

1005
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,140
For funsies.

1006
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,620
Ew.

1007
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,020
Ew.

1008
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,540
They felt like you wasted their time.

1009
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,580
And maybe it is.

1010
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:18,880
Maybe.

1011
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,640
Did you get ectoplasm on their seat?

1012
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,060
No!

1013
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,620
I do my best.

1014
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,500
I try not to.

1015
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,300
Maybe a little bit.

1016
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,100
I once had a Japanese cabbie.

1017
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,920
Take my luggage out of the car and told me to walk because
the distance was too short.

1018
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,660
Still charged me one kid.

1019
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:48,840
No way!

1020
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:49,580
What?

1021
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,500
Taxis don't even start until 500 yen.

1022
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,220
That's crazy.

1023
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:12,450
Actually, the first time I was taxiing to the airport this
time, go home and This is the first time it's ever happened

1024
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,570
my Taxi driver.

1025
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:19,490
He was just like he was like This is so weird.

1026
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:28,310
He couldn't find the entrance for where the taxis go He was
like backing up in the middle of the street And he was like

1027
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:32,510
driving around and he's like I think I got a U-turn over
there He's like sorry.

1028
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,670
I've only been to this airport like three times and

1029
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:47,130
And he, he, he was just like, I'm so sorry that I got lost.

1030
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:56,490
Um, here's, he was like, he was like, the amount added up to
this amount, but I'm going to give you back a thousand yen

1031
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,570
as like a bill.

1032
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:07,290
I've never had a taxi driver like, he like, he was like,
here.

1033
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:09,770
Here's 1000 yen!

1034
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:16,010
I was like, Oh, I don't...

1035
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,430
Okay!

1036
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,090
Yeah, he was really nice.

1037
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:24,070
The live rebate.

1038
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,710
That was nice of him.

1039
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,710
I've never had...

1040
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,450
Well, I was gonna...

1041
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,110
I don't think...

1042
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,250
He was really old, which is also very funny.

1043
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:41,510
I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with a taxi
driver in Japan.

1044
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:46,290
Because most of the time, like 90% of the time, they're like
very quiet.

1045
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:47,510
They just don't bother you.

1046
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:52,410
I have had people though that have like, that have driven
very poorly.

1047
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:57,250
They'd be like, you know, like things like that.

1048
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,430
But no one that was ever actively mean or anything.

1049
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,050
But, okay, I have a confession.

1050
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,770
I don't know if I've ever said this before.

1051
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:19,870
for I've never been to Osaka I just never I've never been to
Osaka I've never been to Kyoto I've just never had a reason

1052
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:30,890
to go out of all of my trips most of the time they also end
up being like work trips so I've never been to I've always

1053
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:49,910
just had to stay in Tokyo and this past trip this past trip
I went to Osaka I went to Osaka for the first time I stayed

1054
01:18:49,910 --> 01:19:03,530
in a little real time with my friends it was very nice it
was but here's my experience with Osaka taxi driver we

1055
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:16,850
needed to get a taxi to to the to the real con the Nancy
your experience oh yeah baby oh yeah baby um was there a

1056
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:29,110
robot cat unfortunately no oh i think it was haunted it
might have been haunted rio con uh but

1057
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:44,230
um what was it saying oh yeah the website for the rio con
said that the shuttle to the Ryokan stops at 2 p.m.

1058
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,070
We got there at 3.

1059
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:50,110
So we were like, okay, well, I guess we gotta get a taxi.

1060
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,510
Little, little did we know.

1061
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:02,050
The taxi driver was just like, hey, that shuttle?

1062
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:06,270
He literally points to it, driving by.

1063
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,170
And he says, right there.

1064
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,370
Thank you for your business.

1065
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,130
Next time you're in LA, can you try getting away mode?

1066
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,430
No, I don't want to drive away mode.

1067
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:34,470
But also, the taxi driver, he was just like, why are you
guys here?

1068
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:36,210
We were like, oh yeah, we're staying at this Ryokan.

1069
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:37,910
He's like, are you going to this temple?

1070
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,670
That was in the nearby area.

1071
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:41,610
We were like, ah, no, probably not.

1072
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,350
We don't really have time.

1073
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,130
He was like, what?

1074
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,350
Why are you

1075
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,330
It's such a waste that you're not going.

1076
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,650
We were like, okay, we have a little bit of time.

1077
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:58,890
We could probably, once we get to the Ryokan, we will hike
there.

1078
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:08,690
Our taxi driver, while yelling at us that this is a waste of
our time to not go to this temple, gets...

1079
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:14,890
He almost gets into an accident with a bus and the bus honks
at him, okay?

1080
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:30,490
And, um, so then at the next light, the driver proceeds to
get out of the bus, I mean, get out of the taxi, and starts

1081
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:33,490
to walk over to the bus to throw hands.

1082
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:41,620
And we were like, only in Osaka maybe.

1083
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:44,160
This is my first Osaka experience.

1084
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:59,560
happened before ever we were just like oh my god oh my god
oh my god beginning of the next chelazard game hi

1085
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:14,830
i miss you i hope you feel better did he win i guess so he
came back and continued to drive us

1086
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:27,160
it was so crazy but the real kind was very nice um There was
like a path.

1087
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,600
We were like, okay, there's a path to like this temple that
he talked about.

1088
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,340
Like a little...

1089
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,440
I say a path.

1090
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,220
It was really a hiking trail.

1091
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,820
I am...

1092
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,580
I am...

1093
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,820
In my dress.

1094
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,560
I am...

1095
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,480
I am not prepared for the outdoors.

1096
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,120
Playing yakuza has made me realize you don't mess with taxi
drivers.

1097
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:56,780
Clearly.

1098
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,140
Why?

1099
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:05,470
We're walking along this path.

1100
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:06,370
We're hiking.

1101
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:13,970
We are like, the path has like, it's on a steep cliff even
and has like this tiny little rope that you have to hold on

1102
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:17,790
to so that you don't slip and fall off and everything.

1103
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:21,610
And we were like, what is this?

1104
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:31,430
And then there's signs that are like, beware of snakes,
beware of wasps, beware of bears beware of monkeys and we

1105
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:46,450
were like in a dress while hiking well I didn't know that
this was going to be a hike there was no I'm surprised there

1106
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:55,670
was no sign that said beware of boars considering boars have
been attacking people but

1107
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:08,290
yeah little did we know like the trail was like another hour
and it was getting dark and we're like how do we how do we

1108
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:16,990
go home we had to there was like we were right next to the
Ryokan but we had like had to go down the street to start

1109
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:29,250
the trail it was like craziness how it was like yeah it was
very long so no we did not get to go to the to the temple

1110
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:41,950
and i guess our trip to osaka was a waste except the next
day when we decided to go to universal studios japan and

1111
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:53,590
that was my first time at universal studios japan so yes
this is my third theme park in two weeks

1112
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:02,710
This is my third day park in two weeks of a trip.

1113
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,610
Something similar happened to be in Poland when my taxi
driver stopped.

1114
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:11,250
He walked behind his car to the other driver and we heard a
very loud audible slap.

1115
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:12,830
That's crazy.

1116
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:14,550
Don't think he's over here with the five gifted.

1117
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:17,190
Oh.

1118
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,450
What was it the last?

1119
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,770
Yes, it was the last one of this trip.

1120
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,750
But, um...

1121
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,690
It was extremely cold.

1122
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:31,670
It was so...

1123
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:33,850
So cold.

1124
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,130
It was so cold.

1125
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,870
And I...

1126
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:40,250
We rode quite a good amount of stuff.

1127
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:42,470
Um...

1128
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,530
I rode the Jaws ride.

1129
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,010
And some of the water got in my mouth.

1130
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,950
And I think now I'm Spider-Man.

1131
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:18,860
souvenir yeah yeah was it yummy water no I was just so
shocked so shocked month six of asking Vintam

1132
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,280
people getting the fights in the middle of the street is so
fitting considering how many king of fighter stages are

1133
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:34,520
located in Osaka it makes sense I once visited 10 theme
parks during a three-week vacation.

1134
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:36,960
So many!

1135
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,000
10?

1136
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:40,580
Also, Teku, thank you so much for the gifted.

1137
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,160
Yeah, I love theme parks so much, though.

1138
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,080
Is that how you got sick?

1139
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,940
No, I was sick before then.

1140
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:57,000
I got sick like a couple days after getting to Japan, but
then I recovered a couple days.

1141
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,060
That was pretty nice.

1142
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:58,780
It wasn't so bad.

1143
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,900
That was my birthday November.

1144
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:02,720
16th.

1145
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:02,860
Stella!

1146
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,800
Happy belated birthday!

1147
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,020
I'm sorry I missed it!

1148
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,060
Happy belated birthday!

1149
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,300
Unreal Citizen, welcome back!

1150
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,240
Thank you!

1151
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,760
What did Mario do?

1152
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,660
I'm getting to it, I'm getting to it!

1153
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,640
Oh my gosh.

1154
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,140
Let's see, what else did I do?

1155
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,640
I have to skip a whole day because I cannot talk about that.

1156
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,180
It's redacted information.

1157
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:35,360
But I did get to play the OG Idolmaster and I posted my P
cards on on on Twitter.

1158
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:42,120
I'm Minto P and I am the producer of Yori, aka Minto Baby.

1159
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,800
That's my baby.

1160
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:46,880
Minto Baby.

1161
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,740
But this is redacted.

1162
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:51,740
That's redacted day.

1163
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,180
Well, I want to talk about it so bad because it was an
absolutely horrifying experience.

1164
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:10,900
It was of the scariest things I've ever done in my entire
afterlife so I will talk about it when I can talk about it.

1165
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:15,440
Hey Mark welcome back thank you.

1166
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:20,600
Huh yeah unfortunately I cannot say anything yet.

1167
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,940
We won't tell anybody.

1168
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,560
Your cover of Kanzi Gavite yesterday was my third most
played song.

1169
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:30,220
Oh my gosh thank you.

1170
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,020
Thank you thank you.

1171
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,720
Good scary or bad scary?

1172
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:45,960
Uh, no, it was, it was good, just very scary.

1173
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:57,500
Oh, but, um, did Universal.

1174
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,980
The rides were very fun.

1175
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:17,780
Um, and then I was already feeling my tummy was feeling
pretty pretty sick uh uh the morning of and then we go to

Wait, okay, okay.

1179
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,120
Before we talk about Mario and how much I hate this guy.

1180
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:43,900
Oh my gosh!

1181
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:44,980

Thank you!

1184
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:49,820
I'm embarrassed.

1185
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,600
Nancy Drew is in my top three most watched games.

1186
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:55,560
Phoebe!

1187
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,320
Thank you.

1188
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,040
Woo!

1189
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:02,210
Okay, before I get to Mario...

1190
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,450
The Spy Family ride was so awesome.

1191
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:17,770
I've never ridden a VR roller coaster before but it was
pretty fun I love you welcome home I almost said welcome

1192
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:27,090
home I almost said welcome home I love you too

1193
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:43,100
I did say welcome home no I didn't no Phoebe said that to me
and I almost said welcome home too

1194
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:48,600
Enjoy your meal.

1195
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,320
You too.

1196
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,820
I get to thank you.

1197
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,360
Glad you had a good time, man.

1198
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,420
Yeah, I did.

1199
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,320
Um.

1200
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,690
But, uh...

1201
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:07,680
Uh...

1202
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,540
Yeah, and I've never done a VR roller coaster before.

1203
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,320
It made me...

1204
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,180
I'm very not good with VR stuff and headset stuff.

1205
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,640
It makes me...

1206
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,000
Extremely...

1207
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,060
Extremely sick.

1208
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,960
What are the microwavable KitKat flavors?

1209
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:32,720
Microwavable?

1210
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:35,020
Oh?

1211
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,220
Even the newest stuff?

1212
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,180
Yeah, I'm extremely bad with like any...

1213
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,820
Like 3D rides?

1214
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,460
I'm extremely bad with...

1215
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,300
I'm very bad with VR stuff.

1216
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,640
Like, I...

1217
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,080
I can do any sort of roller coaster.

1218
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:57,100
Easy peasy.

1219
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,520
The second you put me in a movable machine with 3D...

1220
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,840
With, like, those little 3D glasses.

1221
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,560
I'm done for.

1222
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,100
It's so bad.

1223
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:14,700
Luckily, because the Spy Family ride was...

1224
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,620
Also...

1225
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,300
It was a roller coaster.

1226
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,700
I was totally fine.

1227
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,700
Spinning rides are the worst.

1228
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:23,680
I'm totally fine with spinning rides.

1229
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:28,520
I just like VR and 3D stuff makes me so sick.

1230
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,020
It never works properly for me.

1231
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:35,980
So like, it's like the one thing with the Spy Family ride
was like the...

1232
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,540
Yeah, what's it called?

1233
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:45,700
The frame rate was a little off, so it made me a little bit
sicky, but...

1234
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,240
What about drop rides?

1235
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,860
Well, I don't like drop rides too much, but they don't make
me sick at all.

1236
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,980
Regular rides don't make me sick.

1237
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,360
It's only stuff with 3D.

1238
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,980
Or 4D or whatever.

1239
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,500
So, yeah.

1240
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,480
Ooh.

1241
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:07,100
But the Spy Family ride, luckily, I was more okay with than
not okay.

1242
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,960
And then, oh my gosh.

1243
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:14,860
The first thing we did was there was a Detective Conan 4...

1244
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,500
I don't want to call it a 4D ride.

1245
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,540
It was a 4D experience.

1246
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:30,040
sounds like car sickness yes i get really bad car sick i do
i do also oh phil thank you so much for the 50 kids and

1247
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:36,480
thank you thank you otter watcher thank you so much for the
five kids and thank you thank you thank you guys thank you

1248
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:45,300
so much for those that don't know i love detective conan i
love detective conan but this was this was also a first for

1249
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,800
me I don't want to say it was a ride.

1250
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,700
Your seats did lift up.

1251
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,920
He said the line.

1252
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:57,920
He said the line.

1253
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:02,280
But half of it was also with live actors.

1254
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:06,520
So they had, if you know the show, they had an actor for
Sonoko.

1255
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,380
And they had an actor for Ron.

1256
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,460
For Ronchan.

1257
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,400
And it was so cool!

1258
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,960
Like they were on the stage and they were interacting with
Kodin and...

1259
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:26,320
Amuro-kun and he was so cool and Kaito Kid came and um he
was trying to steal the jewel and Conan's proportions are

1260
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:34,580
absolutely fucked man that kid his head is ginormous and his
little tiny body and Amuro was so small and skinny I don't

1261
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:42,660
understand the proportions at all but it was still so fun
and then Kaito Kid was like swinging around and then and

1262
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:51,860
then Kaito Kid you hear him And there's a Kaito Kid actor,
and he comes from the ceiling!

1263
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,080
And he's, like, walking around, and Ron is, like, doing
karate at him.

1264
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,560
And they're, like, behind me!

1265
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,020
And I'm like, whoa!

1266
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,280
Whoa!

1267
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,420
It was...

1268
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,340
It was so awesome.

1269
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,480
I was screaming, and I was...

1270
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,820
I was screaming, and I was...

1271
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,300
I was freaking out!

1272
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,980
It was so awesome!

1273
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:23,890
So, yeah.

1274
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:27,830
It was really, really cool.

1275
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:32,110
I've never had, like, a show like that before.

1276
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:35,050
It was so great.

1277
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:42,750
I haven't watched Detective Conan in quite some time now.

1278
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,310
I'm, like, a couple hundred episodes behind.

1279
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,530
I stopped at, like, episode 900-something.

1280
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:48,430
Right?

1281
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:50,110
I don't remember.

1282
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:52,910
But...

1283
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:56,830
Maybe I did make... Actually, no, I did make it to
episode...

1284
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:58,410
I did make it past a thousand.

1285
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,590
I'm a pretty big Conan fan.

1286
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,550
But I'm not...

1287
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:07,650
Caught up.

1288
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:09,830
I think they're...

1289
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,230
Yeah.

1290
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,850
I'm several hundred episodes behind myself.

1291
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:14,590
Yeah?

1292
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:18,250
I've watched...

1293
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:20,230
Up until, like...

1294
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:22,750
When I stopped, I had watched every single episode.

1295
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:29,110
Yeah Yeah, yeah

1296
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:35,950
So Are you caught up on Zets?

1297
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:48,670
I'm I think I'm I guess two episodes behind though of Zets
because I was gone But yeah, went to went to

1298
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:58,510
USJ so we had so much fun And then the night we went to
Nintendo World.

1299
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,290
And I was like, hey guys.

1300
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:05,250
Am I going to be okay on the Mario Kart ride?

1301
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:07,230
And they were like, it's not VR.

1302
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,830
It's AR.

1303
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:08,350
It's AR.

1304
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,270
And I was like, okay.

1305
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:27,340
I was not okay on the Mario Kart ride.

1306
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:34,210
No.

1307
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,010
And the whole day too.

1308
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:37,870
It's even worse.

1309
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:51,030
What's even worse is the whole day I was like, Mario I hate
that guy I hate him I hate Mario and they were like why do

1310
01:37:51,030 --> 01:38:02,550
you hate Mario Minto and I was like because I played that
game for like 11 hours and you know what he says I'm a tire

1311
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:11,490
and you know what I say I do all that work Mario not you and

1312
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:23,340
so after Mario ride oh it was so bad on the ride itself I
was like okay so if you're not sure how the Mario cart ride

1313
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:32,660
works you put on this big old helmet and then they attach a
visor like thing to you they look like like goggles almost

1314
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:49,960
and those show so the ride moves and then also And then
also, there's like the characters in front of you on the

1315
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:50,380
goggles.

1316
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:51,640
It's very confusing.

1317
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,140
And...

1318
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:06,900
For me, some people can kind of like see the track and see
the characters at the same time.

1319
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,580
For me, it was like focus on one or the other.

1320
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,660
And the point of the game is you shoot the shell.

1321
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:23,680
at like the other characters and you get coins and so like I
said I have big issues with VR I have big issues with like

1322
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:32,720
3d and stuff my eyes are only focused on so that's why I
can't look at my phone when I'm in the car I can't read when

1323
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:40,380
I'm like in the car things like that like if I'm in the
passenger seat I can't do anything like that so I have to be

1324
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:45,840
fully focused on like the and like where we're driving,
things like that.

1325
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1326
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,680
So, um...

1327
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:58,540
So I'm fully focused on the characters that I'm shooting
because my eyesight is focused on that.

1328
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,220
I'm not seeing anything that's happening around me.

1329
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,440
And so it's...

1330
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,520
And I'm like half trying to see what's going on and half
trying to shoot these characters.

1331
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,100
And I don't know if maybe...

1332
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:21,240
it's meant to be like that it seems like you're supposed to
look at them at the same time but my eyes could not focus on

1333
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,900
both at the same time you know so

1334
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:44,000
I get to the end of the ride and it stops and I was like I
was like okay that was a ride and then I get off And I was

1335
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:51,920
like, oh no, oh no, oh, oh, I'm not gonna make it.

1336
01:40:52,200 --> 01:41:01,900
And I go outside and I'm, it's, okay, if you've never been
to Nintendo World, it's the most overstimulating location

1337
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:06,860
you'll ever be in your entire life or afterlife, depending
on if you're alive or not.

1338
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:15,900
I'm sitting on a stinking toad stool thinking like, just try
not to, the children around me with with ectoplasm all over

1339
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:27,600
the floor i'm all i see is like piranha plants being like in
my peripheral i see i see yoshis i see toads i see

1340
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:40,040
everything moving all at once and i mean and that is the
worst feeling when you are sick when you are feeling so sick

1341
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:53,240
the worst feeling is having literally everything in the
world around you being like the most insane everything I

1342
01:41:53,240 --> 01:42:08,440
ended up having to go to the toad cafe and I got like some
hot yuzu drink and um yeah bad idea because after that I was

1343
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:12,020
like I'm not gonna make it and so I went to the party

1344
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,200
and did what I needed to do.

1345
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,960
I'm throwing up to the underwater music.

1346
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,260
Yeah, I threw up because of Mario.

1347
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:42,980
And I have, what's funny too is the cue for the Mario Kart
ride is amazing.

1348
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,540
It's so awesome.

1349
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,720
It's so much fun.

1350
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,240
I have a million pictures from the cue.

1351
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:55,720
And it literally, as I scroll through them, it feels like
moments before disaster.

1352
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,400
This is like...

1353
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:02,260
BM before Mario.

1354
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:08,880
My pictures are that and PM post Mario.

1355
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,620
He left out that Mario pretty much exclusively.

1356
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,380
Only eats mushrooms whenever he can.

1357
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,580
It's only natural you would eventually become enemies.

1358
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,740
Yeah, it's so true.

1359
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,600
But the queue for the ride is amazing.

1360
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,280
I plan on visiting USJ next year.

1361
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,180
And I was so sad too because I didn't feel well.

1362
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,500
I missed out on Donkey Kong ride.

1363
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,840
I was so sad.

1364
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:41,880
So I just have to go back another time, I guess.

1365
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,020
One day I'll go back.

1366
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,940
I just wanted to ride DK.

1367
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:49,680
Okay.

1368
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,020
Astrobot would never do you like that.

1369
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,880
Oh my gosh, imagine an Astrobot ride?

1370
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,200
It would be the cutest thing ever.

1371
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:04,000
It's gonna ask what happened at Nintendo World because you
said how you'll get back to Mario later after your spy filmy

1372
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,640
ride experience.

1373
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,620
Talk that Mario sounded so vicious now we know why.

1374
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,340
Just got confirmation that I passed my paramedic course!

1375
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,000
Wanted to spread the love.

1376
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:13,460
Miguel!

1377
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:14,940
Congratulations!

1378
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,580
Congrats, congrats!

1379
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,340
Sony will have to make their own theme park.

1380
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,260
I wish that like IPs...

1381
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:32,840
I wish...

1382
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,000
I wish we could like...

1383
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:40,280
I understand why it's important, but sometimes I wish we
could just throw IPs away.

1384
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,380
Imagine the amazing theme parks we could get if we could
just have like...

1385
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,680
Have a video game themed park, you know?

1386
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:53,080
It would be so awesome.

1387
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,060
If we could just have, like, you know, like a Resident Evil
area.

1388
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,080
You know, or...

1389
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,380
Just...

1390
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,240
Super Smash World.

1391
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,460
Yeah, exactly.

1392
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,220
Like Fortnite.

1393
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,460
Yeah, like Fortnite.

1394
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,100
It would be so awesome.

1395
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,240
It would be so cool.

1396
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,080
Oh, yeah.

1397
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,280
Metal Gear area.

1398
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:20,940
Metal Gear.

1399
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:29,780
escape room which did exist but yeah it would be so awesome

1400
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:50,820
oh yeah USJ does have resident evil at times they have for
Halloween they have like Leon come out and stuff um uh they

1401
01:45:50,820 --> 01:46:02,580
had some monster hunter cafe while I was there I did not get
to go into it though um But like an actual theme park where

1402
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,140
it's like, oh my gosh, like a...

1403
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,700
Oh, it would be so cool!

1404
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,720
A Resident Evil themed like laser tag.

1405
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:14,500
Winter Cedar, happy birthday!

1406
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,840
Happy, happy birthday!

1407
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,460
But yeah, so USJ happened.

1408
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:25,140
Then I went back to Tokyo for a couple days.

1409
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,580
I went and saw Zootopia too!

1410
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:36,960
Um...

1411
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,040
Uh...

1412
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,140
Uh, it was fine.

1413
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,820
I watched it in Japanese.

1414
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,000
Um...

1415
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,600
So I kind of want to see some of the parts in English, what
they say.

1416
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,340
Uh...

1417
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,640
Did you enjoy the three Kojima lines?

1418
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,340
Yeah, I did.

1419
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:17,180
So, I didn't hate the movie at first.

1420
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,580
I don't hate it now even.

1421
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,640
I was just kind of like...

1422
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:21,900
Hmm.

1423
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,020
I was just kind of like...

1424
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,700
I was like enjoying it during the movie, you know?

1425
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,060
I was like kind of brain off just having fun.

1426
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,640
And then afterwards I was like...

1427
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,780
I heard I made references to a certain comic.

1428
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,480
I made references to the Shining.

1429
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,620
I liked that part.

1430
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,300
That was funny.

1431
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:48,720
Apparently, there was supposed to be like a four-minute
scene that was replicating the speech, like the talk between

1432
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:51,020
Clarice and Hannibal, but they took that out.

1433
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:53,560
Did I have subtitles?

1434
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:53,960
No.

1435
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,220
I had no subtitles.

1436
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,420
I had to just be...

1437
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:00,660
I had to be kind of like brain-on the entire time because it
was in Japanese.

1438
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:02,980
Um.

1439
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,360
But, uh...

1440
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:10,360
So that was kind of like a little draining because of it.

1441
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:24,260
because I had to be so like Nihongo on Nihongo on uh um but
I thought that it would be okay because maybe um it's a

1442
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:41,820
Disney movie hmm uh but okay the movie slight spoilers here
for anybody um here I'll I'll put up a thing just because

1443
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,600
the movie is so...

1444
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,720
Actually, wait, the movie's been out a couple weeks here,
no?

1445
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,860
Wait, the movie's been out a couple weeks in America, no?

1446
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:52,700
I think?

1447
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,840
It's been out like a week.

1448
01:48:58,840 --> 01:48:59,340
Which movie?

1449
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:00,800
Zootopia, too!

1450
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:04,680
I don't think Western jokes translate well when dubbed to
Japanese.

1451
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:06,600
Some were funny.

1452
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:08,380
Hi, Oivo.

1453
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,480
Some were, like, kind of...

1454
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,880
Okay, hold on.

1455
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,500
I'll just write Zootopia.

1456
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,360
I'll just write spoilers.

1457
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,040
Because it is a newer movie.

1458
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,440
I don't want to be that person.

1459
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:22,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1460
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,500
Here, let's do...

1461
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,940
Zootopia 2 spoilers.

1462
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,220
Okay, I'll turn it off.

1463
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,020
I'll take it down once I'm done talking about it.

1464
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,480
Okay, so the movie takes place one week.

1465
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,040
after the first movie, which I'm kind of sick of them doing
this.

1466
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:52,680
Please, if you're going to make a sequel, but the movie
takes five years to make, I am not still in the setting of

1467
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,180
Zootopia 1 anymore.

1468
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,920
Like, it is...

1469
01:49:58,740 --> 01:49:59,660
That's quick.

1470
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,180
Yeah!

1471
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,260
A week after the...

1472
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:05,440
Yeah, Incredibles 2 moment.

1473
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,600
The same thing, exactly, exactly.

1474
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,480
Like, I'm just like, my brain is not...

1475
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,400
in Zootopia 1 anymore.

1476
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,380
Like, I am ready for the future.

1477
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:19,440
So sad when I went to see FNAF 2, but my local theater
didn't have Toy Freddy Bucket.

1478
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:19,880
No!

1479
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,300
Guys, I have to pee.

1480
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:21,980
Hold on.

1481
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,540
Pea time.

1482
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,320
I have to pee real quick.

1483
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,360
Hold on.

1484
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,160
Hold on.

1485
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,500
I'll talk more in a second.

1486
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,240
Sorry.

1487
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:30,020
I also got some cereal.

1488
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,980
Okay, back to Zootopia.

1489
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,220
Back to Zootopia.

1490
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,780
I'm two spoilers.

1491
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,960
I was starting to get hungry.

1492
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:44,920
With cereal?

1493
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:48,260
My favorite honey bunches of words.

1494
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:07,050
Okay.

1495
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:09,390
Starts one week.

1496
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,170
After.

1497
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,750
After Zootopia 1.

1498
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:17,410
They even do like a little recap.

1499
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:18,390
Did you wash your hands?

1500
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:19,410
Oh my god!

1501
01:54:20,050 --> 01:54:20,650
I...

1502
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:22,550
Oh my god.

1503
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:28,330
Because I was gone for two weeks, my soap dispenser kind of
like...

1504
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:31,090
It has a very thin nozzle, the one that I use.

1505
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,250
It's...

1506
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:38,230
It's very thin.

1507
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:44,490
And I went to wash my hands last night when I got home.

1508
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:47,010
It spit to the right.

1509
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:48,890
I was like, no!

1510
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:51,370
It like exploded.

1511
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:55,290
And then...

1512
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,150
Exploded to the right.

1513
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:57,930
And I was like, no!

1514
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,330
This morning I like covered it.

1515
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:02,590
I was like, okay, I'm gonna cover it.

1516
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:06,430
And I've covered like the front and the right part.

1517
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:08,230
I was like, okay, it's not gonna explode on me today.

1518
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:10,250
It exploded to the left.

1519
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:15,310
And so this time I like cupped it.

1520
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:17,210
Like really, I was like, okay.

1521
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:21,250
It can't go left or right now.

1522
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:23,950
It went up.

1523
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:25,090
Just

1524
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:31,080
up.

1525
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,920
Oh, man.

1526
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,160
Okay, it takes place one week after Zootopia went.

1527
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:01,940
There's like this book that explains

1528
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,360
how Zootopia was formed.

1529
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:13,300
It's like this Lynx cat that wrote it.

1530
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,380
And he's like, I'm the creator of Zootopia.

1531
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:31,220
it's not him it was really this snake this snake's mom is is
is the one that created it and they like that they there's

1532
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:45,540
like this there's like this uh son of the links that that is
like I'm an outcast in my family and I want to be I want to

1533
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:54,280
put a stop to my family because they're evil and but of
course he's the twist villain I called it from as soon as I

1534
01:56:54,280 --> 01:57:01,840
saw him I was like okay this guy's the twist villain sure
whatever and uh he was he was like I don't actually want to

1535
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:12,140
stop my family I want to be accepted by my family and I'm
like you are so stupid you already were what it was so

1536
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:18,720
obvious it was so obvious the snake that they advertise is
like the is like a villain.

1537
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,300
So basically, I never realized.

1538
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:24,600
But in Zootopia 1, did you guys notice that there were no
reptiles?

1539
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:29,180
I guess I never thought about it.

1540
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:36,640
But in Zootopia 2, the cat was just like, I don't want
reptiles in Zootopia.

1541
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,220
And so that's why, like, I guess because of the snake or
whatever.

1542
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,180
No birds either.

1543
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:48,500
Well, at the end, after the credits, they hint at a bird

1544
01:57:51,540 --> 01:58:03,540
wait is that why at the end after the credits they show like
a little feather oh there's gonna be a third zootopia in 30

1545
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:15,360
37 and it'll be it'll take place 30 seconds after the first
zootopia ended or the second one ended

1546
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:28,660
I love going to Disney movies for the past decade asking
who's going to be the twist villain I know Disney movies

1547
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:38,600
gosh but the thing is Nick in the first movie very
charismatic very cool this guy he he's a bad boy you know

1548
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:48,320
he's a bit of a bad boy this movie he they turned him into
an absolute weenie the whole time he's like um judy you

1549
01:58:48,320 --> 01:59:00,100
shouldn't be doing that watch out for your safety judy um
judy uh excuse me judy and and judy was a every she's like

1550
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:07,780
oh my gosh we are we are we're partners but she would
abandon him nick would be like judy i need help over here

1551
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:16,920
never would help him would just go off and do her own thing
i was like what is what This is... It was so... It's such a

1552
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:19,500
hard watch with both of them.

1553
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,840
And... And then at the same time...

1554
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:27,800
At the same time...

1555
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:30,060
So, they... They...

1556
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,200
If you are wondering if their relation... How their
relationship is.

1557
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,820
Their relationship status.

1558
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,000
This is what they would do.

1559
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:42,500
This is the exact type of dialogue they would say.

1560
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,340
They would be like...

1561
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:47,300
You're the most important person in my life.

1562
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:49,720
I never want a different partner.

1563
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,260
A different work partner than you.

1564
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:59,320
Oh, my life was so boring and terrible until I found you.

1565
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,360
I never wanted to join the police academy to become a police
officer.

1566
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,120
I wanted to do it only because I wanted friends.

1567
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:15,420
And in Japanese, there's a line that Judy records with her
little like, carrot thing.

1568
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,580
In Japanese, he says, what was it?

1569
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:25,720
Was it like, I think it was, I think it was, I think it was,
but I need to know what he says.

1570
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,640
Or was it, I don't know if he calls her, I don't even
remember.

1571
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,020
I know he calls her ninjin, like carrots.

1572
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,260
He calls her ninjin.

1573
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,020
But, what does he say in English?

1574
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,720
He says, I love you?

1575
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:40,540
Does he actually?

1576
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:46,280
But my God, the baiting, they, They debated them like crazy.

1577
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,960
Like their relationship.

1578
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:54,040
They would say they would do the most like...

1579
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,360
Oh, I love you so much!

1580
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:56,700
As my partner.

1581
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,080
I...

1582
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,400
I never want to be with anyone else.

1583
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,680
As a police officer.

1584
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:04,840
It was like the worst!

1585
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,800
He says I love you.

1586
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,640
No way.

1587
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:09,880
Wow.

1588
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:18,150
Still spoiling?

1589
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:18,950
All done now.

1590
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:19,950
I'm fine.

1591
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:20,270
I'm done.

1592
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:23,030
now I

1593
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:34,130
love my officer partner yeah it was very much the hug

1594
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:55,020
the post credit Judy kept replaying it I know I know let
them kiss let them kiss what

1595
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:12,570
about gojumbo's part he was like this little mole guy they
bust down his wall and he goes yeah And then there's another

1596
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:15,390
part where he goes, he says, he says something, I don't
remember.

1597
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:25,030
But he says like, just like that.

1598
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:36,760
At the beginning, there's a, there's like a little, oh my
gosh, I can't remember what the animal is called.

1599
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:40,320
She's the counselor lady for the partners.

1600
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,880
At the beginning of the film, that's voiced by Nana Mizuki.

1601
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:45,060
I was like, whoa!

1602
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:51,190
Yeah, he's done it again!

1603
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:52,410
He's done it again!

1604
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:55,650
He says Kojima Kami Nandes.

1605
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,270
Oh, the last part of my trip.

1606
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:10,470
Day before I left.

1607
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:15,890
I went to a concert!

1608
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:19,990
Guys, I only got to go to one concert.

1609
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:23,790
I didn't do anything idols this time besides meeting
Nemo-chan.

1610
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:27,350
But...

1611
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:29,370
I went to a concert for Asaka!

1612
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:34,090
My favorite Ani song singer, she's so sweet!

1613
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,330
She's so, so nice!

1614
02:03:38,050 --> 02:03:39,730
Minto Judy fanfic.

1615
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:41,570
Imagine?

1616
02:03:42,030 --> 02:03:42,590
Wait, why?

1617
02:03:42,730 --> 02:03:44,170
I don't want to be paired with Judy, though.

1618
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:47,490
She was so not nice in this movie.

1619
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:54,430
Yeah, I went to Asaka concert and it was so nice.

1620
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:59,650
And I got to talk to her actually a little bit after the
show.

1621
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:07,310
And she sang, she sang Waya Waya Waya, which is a song that
I did at Fantastic Reality.

1622
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:11,290
And so we were like, Waya Waya Waya together.

1623
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:15,510
And I was like, I was so happy.

1624
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:18,310
She's so sweet.

1625
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:20,330
She's so, so nice.

1626
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:22,350
Yeah.

1627
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:24,710
Love her.

1628
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:26,190
Love Isoca.

1629
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:31,950
And she was like, can we take a selfie?

1630
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:36,130
And I'm like, so I'm on her phone now.

1631
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:57,510
It's really crazy how becoming a YouTuber has had me like
meet so many of these people that I've like loved for so

1632
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:57,970
long.

1633
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:01,790
I don't know.

1634
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:05,810
Yeah, I was the spirit photography for real.

1635
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:23,530
And then when I also did...

1636
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:43,290
Yeah!

1637
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:45,650
That was fun and scary.

1638
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:05,350
Stop doing that YouTube emote.

1639
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:06,950
The angry one?

1640
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:09,810
That one?

1641
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:11,070
Stab it.

1642
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:20,090
Lip readers, did you catch that?

1643
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:29,120
Face red droopy eyes, face red droopy eyes, face red droopy
eyes.

1644
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,060
I haven't seen a FNAF movie yet.

1645
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,400
I heard it's great FNAF movie.

1646
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,200
I heard it's bad movie.

1647
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,480
I can't believe that.

1648
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:44,140
That's crazy.

1649
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:44,960
I know.

1650
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:01,940
That's the perfect description.

1651
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:02,360
Really?

1652
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:02,780
Okay.

1653
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,640
Can I hear the FNAF TikTok trend?

1654
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,100
No?

1655
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:14,300
I still do eyes glowing red.

1656
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:20,450
Why?

1657
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:22,070
So I can do the YouTube emote.

1658
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:29,050

02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:12,060
Wait.

1698
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:12,520
Ugh.

1699
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:15,100
Let me just copy the thing.

1700
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,820
Uh, let me just copy their link.

1701
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:21,300
That.

1702
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:27,600
There you go.

1703
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:30,420
Pian message.

1704
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:31,300
Welcome back, Minto.

1705
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,420
Not like I missed you or anything.

1706
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:33,960
Deku!

1707
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:39,800
I guess I have to make a new PC.

1708
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,940
It's so pretty.

1709
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:46,040
It's so clean.

1710
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:47,940
It's so clean looking.

1711
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:52,720
It's like exactly the kind of PC that I would want.

1712
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:59,280
Ram is so expensive now.

1713
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:01,200
I heard about that, right?

1714
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:02,500
I would just transfer everything.

1715
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:14,340
everything from my current setup into into this into this
case yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't buy all new parts I think

1716
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:24,900
everything that I have would fit in here probably I don't
even know what are the prices now for RAM trip

1717
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:40,880
$1,000 five four five times the price?

1718
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,360
No way.

1719
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:14,570
Damn,

1720
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:31,070
that was $50 per stick when I bought it in 2023 is like $400
now.

1721
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:43,200
You know, guys, that really sucks.

1722
02:12:54,120 --> 02:13:09,380
Hopefully everybody has PCs good enough right now that you
don't have to upgrade and uh that yeah that's just all yeah

1723
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:13,460
hope that it goes down event back down eventually

1724
02:13:25,370 --> 02:13:27,910
pray for the bubble crash yeah yeah yeah

1725
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:39,820
stinking ai

1726
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:51,530
We can download more RAM Once there were beanie babies Then
the boo-boo is now the latest collector found RAM

1727
02:13:55,500 --> 02:14:03,020
We must have hope That's all we can have honestly That's all
we got

1728
02:14:07,310 --> 02:14:10,190
Download more Download more

1729
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:21,450
I'm looking at my sticks right now being like Don't die on
me you do.

1730
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:26,970
Don't you die on me.

1731
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:28,450
How jet-lagged are you?

1732
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:29,810
I'm pretty jet-lagged.

1733
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:32,990
I took a nap earlier and now I'm like, am I going to be able
to sleep tonight?

1734
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:37,950
Hmm.

1735
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:44,680
You wouldn't download a car.

1736
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:47,860
My car is full of RAM.

1737
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:55,340
I could not have picked the worst time to upgrade.

1738
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:55,820
No!

1739
02:14:56,500 --> 02:15:08,340
There's slim chance it'll be in the mint okay I hope so yeah
I'm sorry that I can't like sell them sell them which uh you

1740
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:20,260
know that's okay honestly I feel that there have been so
many vtuber cases being created lately that I'm like I I

1741
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:34,980
there's such also an expensive product that I felt that it
would be tough for for people so maybe in the future though

1742
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:44,620
if you have maybe I could do like PC stickers or something
stickers meant that you meant for your for your PC case if

1743
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:52,760
you are so keen on you know getting something mmm I'm Minto
phone case.

1744
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:55,300
Phone cases are even more difficult, though, I feel.

1745
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:58,340
Because there's so many different types of phones.

1746
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:02,280
Hmm.

1747
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:05,160
Mint Phantom Brand Ram.

1748
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:09,080
I'm, okay, I'm, I'm creating my own RAM company right now.

1749
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:15,700
Yeah, so many models.

1750
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:16,520
Yeah, yeah.

1751
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,880
My 11-month-year-old PC.

1752
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:26,340
Wait, 11-month-old PC.

1753
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:34,340
month year old PC dot wait it was 3k to 4k to bill but I'm
having someone look at it did he pray for it to work no

1754
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:44,940
wireson I hope it works come back come back come back come
back one thing about Universal Japan but that I did not

1755
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:56,640
expect is the staff there are so so kind they're so nice
there like even nicer than any of the staff that I'm would

1756
02:16:56,640 --> 02:17:00,600
run into at Disney like Like, which...

1757
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:04,020
I thought Disney had amazing service, like Tokyo Disney.

1758
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:07,520
But USJ stuff are crazy.

1759
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:12,040
There was, after the Conan ride, I went to go buy some Conan
merch.

1760
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:17,500
And I had, like, a Toru Amuro hair tie.

1761
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:20,420
And I was getting...

1762
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:23,200
Oh, here's where my gotcha luck went crazy.

1763
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:27,940
I was getting two things that were, like, little keychains.

1764
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:38,740
one keychain I really wanted because it's the same keychain
as uh um as Ron from detective Conan I wanted her same

1765
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:47,160
keychain and then another one was a gotcha box for uh some
of the characters but they were like usj themed like they

1766
02:17:47,160 --> 02:18:00,200
were wearing different merch or like themed to the different
rides it was really cute and um and so I she sees the lady

1767
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:07,680
checking me out she sees that I have the Amuro hair tie and
she's like and she looks at the box that I'm getting and

1768
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:15,720
she's like she's like do you like Amuro kun and I was like
yeah I love Amuro kun and so she looks at my box and she

1769
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:23,060
like puts her hands together like she's praying and she says
please I hope this box has Amuro kun please I hope this box

1770
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:35,160
has Amuro kun she blessed my poles she literally poles in
real time it was so cute and then it was like no one has

1771
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:46,360
ever done that for me before like at a store it was so so
cute and so i opened all my stuff outside the store my box

1772
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:57,440
amaro-kun so i went inside and i showed her and i was like i
got amaro and she was so happy for me It was so cute!

1773
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:01,080
And then, the keychain that I wanted, I got two packs.

1774
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:03,560
Both of them were the same keychain.

1775
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:06,840
Crazy!

1776
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:10,500
Yeah.

1777
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:14,020
So, I got that.

1778
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:16,400
And then, um...

1779
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:20,880
There was one other thing that I had done a gotcha pull for,
and I got it first try.

1780
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,240
I don't remember what it was.

1781
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:32,440
Right up is real I know I was like whoa My polls And
everybody All my friends kept commenting on it They were

1782
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:41,200
like They were like You'll Your polls are Are so lucky Like
what is your luck this trip?

1783
02:19:52,020 --> 02:20:00,120
Never punished I guess You should give her a PC case I don't
know She'll need it

1784
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:11,080
I'm almost done with my share oil.

1785
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:14,860
It's like oatmeal at this point.

1786
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,520
Mario throw up.

1787
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:24,500
Oh, this was before Mario, though.

1788
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:28,480
I guess that did balance out my day throwing up after Mario.

1789
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:29,800
Hmm.

1790
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:31,940
Yeah.

1791
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:34,000
Yeah.

1792
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:36,340
Can you eat with my mouth open?

1793
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:36,860
No!

1794
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:37,440
No!

1795
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:44,350
Weren't you gonna get tea?

1796
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:44,870
Oh!

1797
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:46,570
I was gonna get tea.

1798
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:47,330
Thank you.

1799
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:49,730
I'll be right back.

1800
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:50,250
Two seconds.

1801
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:50,730
Two seconds.

1802
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:58,910
Let me put a thing.

1803
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:00,390
Tea.

1804
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:14,020
Hi!

1805
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:19,790
Oh, I was like, where did my music go?

1806
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:24,070
I was like, huh?

1807
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:29,090
I I put on my headphones and it was silence.

1808
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:30,550
What kind of tea?

1809
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:32,670
Just I'm getting my cha.

1810
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:37,680
Yawn.

1811
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:38,360
Don't tell us.

1812
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:39,760
Don't say yawn.

1813
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,040
Don't say yawn.

1814
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:48,420
Glad the trip felt like an actual vacation.

1815
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:52,900
There were some things, like, uh...

1816
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:54,040
I think with, uh...

1817
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:58,620
Leah's thing did not feel like a vacation, obviously.

1818
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:05,240
And leading up to it, I was still, like, having to practice
the dance every night.

1819
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:07,060
I learned the dance that week.

1820
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:09,880
I don't know if I told her that.

1821
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:10,580
Don't tell her that.

1822
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,600
Don't tell her I said that.

1823
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:20,020
But, uh...

1824
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,580
I learned it that week.

1825
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:22,820
Because I was so...

1826
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:25,800
I was way too busy to learn it before then.

1827
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:27,240
So...

1828
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:27,760
Oopsie.

1829
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:35,960
Actually, I might have told her that.

1830
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,080
I might have been like, well, yeah.

1831
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,040
I barely practiced.

1832
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,540
No, I did practice.

1833
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:51,100
But, yeah.

1834
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:54,160
But now I'm back!

1835
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:56,680
And, uh, it was...

1836
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,160
It was fun!

1837
02:23:58,360 --> 02:23:59,880
I'm so sorry.

1838
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:01,620
I said I would stream.

1839
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,180
And I did a Twitter space.

1840
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:05,920
And I'm so sorry.

1841
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,260
I've learned...

1842
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,100
my lesson though.

1843
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:11,440
From now on, if I know that I'm going to be hanging out with
people most of the time.

1844
02:24:12,340 --> 02:24:15,160
And I knew how packed my trip was.

1845
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:19,040
And still, I was like, I was like hopeful.

1846
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:23,780
You know, I always, I always try to, I always, I always,
what's the word?

1847
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:26,440
I am ambitious.

1848
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,000
I'm ambitious about wanting to stream.

1849
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:31,840
I love streaming.

1850
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:33,300
I always want to hang out with you guys.

1851
02:24:33,620 --> 02:24:37,580
So, but now that I know if I'm going to be with people, It's
gonna be a vacation.

1852
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,920
It's gonna be...

1853
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:42,680
No streaming, most likely.

1854
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:49,390
Tudor space is better than nothing.

1855
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:50,510
Thank you.

1856
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:51,950
I'm so sorry.

1857
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:55,230
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

1858
02:24:55,470 --> 02:24:56,110
I really...

1859
02:24:56,110 --> 02:24:58,230
I guess because, like, you know, also...

1860
02:24:59,570 --> 02:25:00,490
Oh my gosh, I...

1861
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:01,230
When I...

1862
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:03,110
What was I gonna say?

1863
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:08,210

Love hearing from you at all.

02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:52,490
Even the Twitter space.

1872
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:57,530
I feel like I'm pretty bad in general about tweeting.

1873
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:00,090
So...

1874
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:01,890
Yeah, I do my best.

1875
02:26:11,190 --> 02:26:12,210
You peak tweet.

1876
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:12,950
I do?

1877
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:20,350
Oh my gosh, I've been seeing pictures from the The Asa Yoru.

1878
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:23,090
The Asa Yoru event.

1879
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:27,270
And I'm seeing so many faces I recognize.

1880
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:31,130
And look at, wait, can I post these?

1881
02:26:31,350 --> 02:26:31,970
Let me ask.

1882
02:26:32,370 --> 02:26:32,550
Wait.

1883
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:37,930
Can I, um, show these on stream?

1884
02:26:40,530 --> 02:26:41,710
Um, Mane-san.

1885
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:44,970
Are you awake?

1886
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:46,470
Mane-san.

1887
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:58,400
I don't think so.

1888
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:04,760
The last work stream on the other trips, you said you wanted
to show us a picture from your hotel when you got back.

1889
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:06,140
Did you still want to show it?

1890
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:07,400
Big Binto love love.

1891
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Oh!

1892
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:09,040
Oh!

1893
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:09,340
I know!

1894
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:09,800
I know!

1895
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:10,340
I know!

1896
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,260
I know what I was gonna say.

1897
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:16,120
Mani-san, Okite-nai!

1898
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:17,960
Okite-nai!

1899
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,600
Mani-san, Okite-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

1900
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:24,240
Okite-o-o-o-o-oite-o-o-oite-o-oite!

1901
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:27,020
Let's see.

1902
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:29,820
I did have a picture.

1903
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:33,800
From my hotel.

1904
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,400
I think I talked about...

1905
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:40,840
Wait, where is it?

1906
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:43,840
Oh, I think I took it with a different camera.

1907
02:27:44,060 --> 02:27:44,960
Okay, hold on.

1908
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:49,900
Let me triple check these photos.

1909
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:52,400
I think I talked about how...

1910
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,820
The haunted hotel?

1911
02:27:56,820 --> 02:27:57,380
Okay.

1912
02:27:58,040 --> 02:27:59,460
No, if this is...

1913
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:02,400
During the work stream...

1914
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:07,780
Which... Oh my gosh, the work stream was supposed to be me
learning the dance.

1915
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,860
For it was supposed to be me!

1916
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,380
Me learning the dance!

1917
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:30,120
That was supposed to be it!

1918
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,000
Okay, hold on.

1919
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:32,700
Let me pose... Let me... Okay.

1920
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:38,940
But no, this was going to be the hotel that I stayed at when
I was hanging out with Nimmy and Phoebe.

1921
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:47,820
so i talked about it i think i don't actually know if i
mentioned it maybe i didn't because of i didn't want to give

1922
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:56,960
the hotel away or anything um but basically the hotel i
stayed at was very oh my gosh the bathroom was so bizarre

1923
02:28:56,960 --> 02:29:18,390
because uh because i had a stinking rubik's cube as like the
handles for the shower and stuff so give me a second okay

1924
02:29:18,390 --> 02:29:21,710
this one is okay I know I sent this to people

1925
02:29:25,950 --> 02:29:40,210
let me crop this one a little bit because yeah it was like a
puzzle cube I was like what is this what the heck is this

1926
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:50,570
okay so this the the um what's the word sorry i'm so jet
lagged so i can't think of any words or phrases today

1927
02:29:53,730 --> 02:30:04,390
the the sink and i'm still i'm multitasking so i'm trying to
the sink was not so bad but let me just show you the sink

1928
02:30:04,390 --> 02:30:19,150
real quick oh whoa zoomed in the sink was like this and it
like you see the handles the thing about them is they were

1929
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:26,470
so hard to grip they were extremely hard to grip and they
like would not move yeah they were square they would hurt my

1930
02:30:26,470 --> 02:30:31,830
hand every time i tried to i tried to use it

1931
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:46,100
those are for charms oh like a like a keychain oh but this
is not the problem This is not the problem.

1932
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,420
The sink.

1933
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,120
The sink was just a little annoying.

1934
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:49,520
Hold on.

1935
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,620
Let me do this.

1936
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,400
I will show you.

1937
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:56,020
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1938
02:30:57,740 --> 02:30:59,060
This is the shower.

1939
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:02,440
What is this?

1940
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:09,480
And there's no indication of which way is hot and which way
is cold.

1941
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:13,820
There was no, like, little blue dot or little red dot.

1942
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:18,440
And it was also extremely difficult to push.

1943
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:19,780
I think I took a video.

1944
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:20,940
I'm not going to play it, though.

1945
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,260
I took a video of me, like, because I was showing people.

1946
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:26,900
I was like trying to push it.

1947
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:28,240
Minecraft Hotel.

1948
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,020
I know.

1949
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:34,970
It's so weird.

1950
02:31:40,510 --> 02:31:41,710
It's extremely...

1951
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:45,370
I had a puzzle cube as my shower handle.

1952
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:47,690
What even is that?

1953
02:31:47,710 --> 02:31:49,690
You can see, it's funny too.

1954
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:51,570
You can see it's like a little fogged up.

1955
02:31:51,670 --> 02:31:53,170
I was like about to get in the shower.

1956
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:55,730
Then I was like, I need to take a picture of the stinking
thing.

1957
02:31:58,570 --> 02:31:59,510
The Minecraft shower.

1958
02:32:02,370 --> 02:32:05,070
To unlock hot water, you must complete the Millennium
puzzle.

1959
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:06,830
Or bathe in the shadow realm.

1960
02:32:08,190 --> 02:32:11,670
Last time I was house hunting, I had a saying when I came
across weird designs.

1961
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:12,670
Things people would do.

1962
02:32:12,770 --> 02:32:13,690
Decisions were made.

1963
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:15,750
Definitely applies here.

1964
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:17,470
Yeah, I just don't understand.

1965
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:34,650
like minimalism has gone too far it has gone way too far
when your shower handle is a 4D cube Levent configuration

1966
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:52,510
has shower handle it's so weird resident evil room design oh
man but yeah I think that's the Pretty sure that was what I

1967
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:54,330
was wanting to show a picture of.

1968
02:32:55,870 --> 02:33:00,350
Anything else that I want to show from my Japan trip, I'll
post on Twitter.

1969
02:33:02,330 --> 02:33:11,390
Because I do have a handful of, like, photos from Fujisan
and Tee.

1970
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:17,170
I can post stuff from the theme parks.

1971
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:20,190
So, I will post those on Twitter.

1972
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:24,550
I just don't feel like going through them right now.

1973
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:29,710
I don't feel like going through it and making sure
everything's good.

1974
02:33:30,010 --> 02:33:30,250
You know.

1975
02:33:32,350 --> 02:33:32,850
Fuji-san!

1976
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:37,230
Fuji-san!

1977
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:38,150
But yeah!

1978
02:33:40,930 --> 02:33:41,810
Fuji-san!

1979
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:51,380
I'm happy to be back, though.

1980
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:52,780
I can't wait to play games tomorrow.

1981
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:55,820
I just want to stream so much now.

1982
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:59,580
I think, honestly, like I did have so much fun.

1983
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:03,180
But I hit my limit where...

1984
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:06,140
Of how long I...

1985
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:08,380
Like, would go without streaming.

1986
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:08,960
You know what I mean?

1987
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:12,260
Like, how long I would want to go or anything.

1988
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:20,100
What are we playing tomorrow?

1989
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:21,640
I have no idea.

1990
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:32,580

collab this week me um me and the dented the girlies no

gonna try and stream.

1994
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:02,760

you know?

1995
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:08,530
Yeah.

1996
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:15,120
I passed my final!

1997
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,880
Your boss helped me through it!

1998
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,060
Shiyaku Sakakura!

1999
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:18,940
Congratulations!

2000
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,840
Mostly in internet time as long.

02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:23,360
Yeah.

2002
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,000
Yeah.

2003
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:29,560
Now that I'm home, like, it feels very, like, the maid cafe,
I don't even remember.

2004
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,980
recognize it a little bit.

2005
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:33,740
Any plans to try out the Yakuza series?

2006
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:35,760
Eventually, I'd like to.

2007
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,800
Yakuza is just extremely long.

02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:47,760

I don't want to play it.

2029
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:31,080
I want to play it.

2030
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,920
Uncharted and Alan Wake are both 10-ish hours.

2031
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:38,480
It's doable.

2032
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:44,100
Yeah, I think I'll play those as, like, some longer,
quote-unquote, longer games.

2033
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:55,920
Uh, this, this month, and then, um, do a bunch of one-shots
for everything else.

2034
02:38:57,300 --> 02:38:57,980
Yeah, yeah.

2035
02:39:02,230 --> 02:39:02,930
Arc is evil.

2036
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:03,950
Welcome back.

2037
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:04,730
Thank you.

2038
02:39:04,910 --> 02:39:05,190
Thank you.

2039
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:05,690
Thank you.

2040
02:39:11,950 --> 02:39:15,370
Alan Wake Peak is absolutely peak if you get to it.

2041
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:22,450
That's why I want to actually that's why I want to start
Alan Wake because I've heard such good things about two that

2042
02:39:22,450 --> 02:39:23,270
I really want.

2043
02:39:23,290 --> 02:39:34,370
want to I want to play it but I have to play one oh okay all
right I'll come up with a bunch of games I've everybody I

2044
02:39:34,370 --> 02:39:49,870
already asked people for games so so I have a bunch of one
shots that I can do we got this we got this 11 games in and

2045
02:39:49,870 --> 02:39:53,210
And I'll be taking off a couple days because of Hallmat.

2046
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:57,050
But I actually will be bringing my setup for Hallmat and I
do want to stream.

2047
02:39:59,150 --> 02:40:01,410
But playing games there might be a little difficult.

2048
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:02,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2049
02:40:07,290 --> 02:40:08,790
They'll figure it out.

2050
02:40:09,810 --> 02:40:12,610
System Shock 2 just got a remaster with four-person
multiplayer.

2051
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:14,410
The single-player campaign is a nail-biter.

2052
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:16,370
System Shock 2.

2053
02:40:20,530 --> 02:40:21,850
System Shock 2.

2054
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:22,950
I don't even know that game.

2055
02:40:22,970 --> 02:40:24,570
Oh, I do know the skin.

2056
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:31,290
I recognize the cover.

2057
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:36,560
Electric boogal.

2058
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:42,720
Well, guys, thank you for the very warm welcome back.

2059
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:43,460
Thank you!

2060
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:48,240
I don't feel so jet lagged, but I do worry that I won't be
able to sleep tonight, maybe.

2061
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:55,320
Um, but uh, Yeah!

2062
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:56,560
Excited!

2063
02:40:57,800 --> 02:40:58,240
Um...

2064
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,860
I'm happy to be back streaming!

2065
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:02,720
Oh, two weeks was way too long.

2066
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:04,420
Way too long.

2067
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,740
Even though I had so much fun.

2068
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:08,000
Tuarko!

2069
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:08,900
Thank you so much!

2070
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:11,100
My dog goes over, thank you!

2071
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:13,280
Glad you had so much fun.

2072
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:13,900
Maybe...

2073
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:15,620
We maybe missed you a tiny bit.

2074
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:16,140
Just maybe.

2075
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:16,740
Possibly.

2076
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:18,980
I hope you had some really good rest tonight.

2077
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:19,600
Thank you!

2078
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:21,960
I slept for like 10 hours last night, you guys.

2079
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:24,100
I went to sleep at...

2080
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:25,940
Midnight in Wugabaten.

2081
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:28,180
And then...

2082
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:29,280
Which is surprising, I felt.

2083
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:31,860
I stayed up as long as I could until midnight.

2084
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:32,800
Was it midnight?

2085
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:33,440
Maybe 11.

2086
02:41:33,640 --> 02:41:34,140
I don't know.

2087
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:37,660
And then I took a nap, even in the day.

2088
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:40,840
I slept, baby.

2089
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:42,420
I slept, baby.

2090
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,100
There's this girl in Japan.

2091
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,380
She's quite popular right now.

2092
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,240
I'm named Shinako.

2093
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:49,840
Hold on.

2094
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:53,820
Yes.

2095
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:58,180
Nako ASMR is her YouTube channel.

2096
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:03,660
She's a very popular YouTube channel where she does like the
crunchy like food ASMR.

2097
02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:06,730
Where she'll like take a bite and it's like...

2098
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:11,440
Like that.

2099
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:14,340
It's not my kind of thing.

2100
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:17,200
But you see her all over the place.

2101
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:24,700
And one really cool thing about her is that she's like kind
of bringing like that like Haru Juku...

2102
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:28,460
Like the old school style Harajuku-K back, you know?

2103
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:32,520
So, um...

2104
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:34,460
Glad to hear you had a fun trip with Time to Yourself.

2105
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:35,140
Glad to have you back.

2106
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:35,780
Thank you!

2107
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:36,980
Thank you so much, Nami!

2108
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:40,600
Um...

2109
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:41,660
ASMR mukbang?

2110
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:44,120
I think it's less mukbang, and it's more like...

2111
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:44,720
She's eating...

2112
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,580
Like, uh...

2113
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:50,180
Aesthetic candies and things.

2114
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:51,820
And they make a nice crunch.

2115
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:54,500
And so some people like the crunching.

2116
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:56,620
Thought you hated mouth crunching.

2117
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:58,860
I literally just said it's not my thing.

2118
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:01,400
Get the earwax out of your ears, Jeff.

2119
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:14,960
But you see her all over Japan and you can tell it's her
because she

2120
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:26,240
has like all the decor and like all the makeup and
everything.

2121
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:27,780
So you're just like, oh, it's Shinako.

2122
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:32,460
But one thing that's really funny about her is she's
extremely popular with children.

2123
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:34,060
And I'm like, you know what?

2124
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:43,060
If the children are listening and watching her, that's so
much better than like other things that they could be

2125
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:44,400
listening or watching to.

2126
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:45,000
So you know what?

2127
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:47,840
Let her do her thing, you know?

2128
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:51,620
And she has this one song called Hara Hara, and it's like
Parapara.

2129
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:54,340
It's like Eurobeat, and she does Parapara.

2130
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:56,680
And it's all about brushing your teeth.

2131
02:43:58,440 --> 02:43:59,260
Things like that.

2132
02:43:59,380 --> 02:44:00,640
Like she's really cute.

2133
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:10,280
popular but i bring her up because um i had a dream that i
was at her concert yesterday but if you ever look up like

2134
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:19,000
concerts of shinako it's so funny because it's like a bunch
of babies in the audience of all of them trying to do like

2135
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:23,240
the para para routine which is very fast

2136
02:44:26,820 --> 02:44:31,120
they're just little babies flailing their arms around

2137
02:44:35,390 --> 02:44:37,190
It's so funny!

2138
02:44:45,090 --> 02:44:46,170
It's fun.

2139
02:44:46,610 --> 02:44:47,170
She's cute.

2140
02:44:47,730 --> 02:44:48,230
I like her.

2141
02:44:49,230 --> 02:44:52,270
I don't watch her ASMR though.

2142
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:54,990
I wish I could show a video.

2143
02:44:55,290 --> 02:44:56,170
It's so funny.

2144
02:44:57,430 --> 02:44:59,970
It's so funny watching the babies.

2145
02:45:01,150 --> 02:45:03,630
Watching the babies flail.

2146
02:45:06,530 --> 02:45:08,430
I literally saw a video like that yesterday.

2147
02:45:08,570 --> 02:45:09,290
It might have been her.

2148
02:45:17,970 --> 02:45:19,910
I don't know why I was going to bring up my dream.

2149
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:22,290
Oh, it's because I slept so much.

2150
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:29,730
I was just talking about how I slept and then I was talking
about how I slept a lot and I had a dream.

2151
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:32,350
That's it.

2152
02:45:35,510 --> 02:45:37,350
They're struggling and you're laughing.

2153
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,560
What was the dream?

2154
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:55,300
said it that I was at her concert the Shinako concert except
she was performing at a pool and so I was like swimming

2155
02:45:55,300 --> 02:46:09,780
around her while she was like performing and like all the
little children were on the side but Minto that really

2156
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:14,740
happened Am I the baby?

2157
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:17,860
I'm the baby, I'm the baby.

2158
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:28,160
Well, anyways, thank you guys.

2159
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,300
So, so much for the really warm welcome back.

2160
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:34,380
I really warm welcome back.

2161
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:36,040
Wait, really warm.

2162
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:39,280
I appreciate it.

2163
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2164
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:44,980
Thank you!

2165
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:48,660
Not the mama.

2166
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:50,040
The mama.

2167
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:52,940
Welcome back and thanks for the stream.

2168
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:53,680
Thank you!

2169
02:46:54,340 --> 02:46:55,200
Thank you, thank you.

2170
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:57,720
Oh gosh.

2171
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:01,380
Right at the very end of my trip.

2172
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:05,880
I did get sick and then right at the very end of my trip my
throat started hurting.

2173
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:07,820
So I hopefully am not...

2174
02:47:07,820 --> 02:47:10,180
Hopefully I can sleep away whatever I'm...

2175
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:12,040
If I'm getting something again.

2176
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:13,440
Hopefully not.

2177
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:27,200
I just keep trying to drink lots of lots of tea Lots of warm
tea Thanks for not forgetting about us Of course I would

2178
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:39,720

guys I didn't realize how much I missed your voice.

2180
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:57,040
Yeah, the influenza was going around really bad.

2181
02:47:57,780 --> 02:47:59,900
Everybody, take your vitamins.

2182
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:06,200
Lots of vitamin C, zinc, whatever else humans need.

2183
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:08,580
Don't get sick.

2184
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:09,240
Stay warm.

2185
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:10,040
Stay safe.

2186
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:10,680
Okay.

2187
02:48:12,580 --> 02:48:13,180
Don't sick.

2188
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:14,120
Don't sick.

2189
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:14,840
No sick.

2190
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:19,820
I was dang, influencers spread an influenza.

2191
02:48:22,660 --> 02:48:24,000
I'm an influence.

2192
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:26,220
Oh my gosh, that reminds me of a story of once.

2193
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:30,740
I think it was Keiaki Zaka had a song called Influenza.

2194
02:48:31,480 --> 02:48:32,280
Like, Influencer.

2195
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:34,980
But when I first heard it, I was like...

2196
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:36,940
No, I didn't say that.

2197
02:48:37,980 --> 02:48:39,060
Thank you, Tri-Frincess.

2198
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:39,720
Thank you.

2199
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:42,680
