1
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh.

2
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,040
Oh gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,840
My voice sounds so bad.

4
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,420
I sound like a rugrat.

5
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,920
For real.

6
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,700
Welcome back.

7
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,260
Master, ma'am.

8
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm even more embarrassed because this might be some people's first time hearing me.

9
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,960
And I sound like a rugrat.

10
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,260
Hello, everybody.

11
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,540
Hello, happy new year.

12
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,640
Oh my gosh, this is my first stream of the new year.

13
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,420
Happy 2025.

14
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,660
For those who don't know, I just got back from Nihon.

16
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,240
I just got back from Japan.

17
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,800
And in Japan, I got sick.

18
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,380
And you're probably just like, how does a ghost get sick in Japan?

19
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,060
Well, I always say that being a ghost is overrated.

20
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,620
Because, because it's just like being human with a little less gravity.

21
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,340
A little less gravity involved.

22
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:55,960
But yeah, Year of the Snake, and my first stream back is Toho!

23
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Yippee!

24
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh my gosh.

25
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,040
Wow, I can't believe my first stream back is a sponsored stream.

26
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,760
But this is a really exciting sponsored stream, I think.

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,500
Because I'm gonna be in the game!

28
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah!

29
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,340
Yeah, yeah, it's Kanako's year.

30
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, let me introduce myself for maybe people who don't know me.

31
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,260
My name is Mint Frantom.

32
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,000
Some people are probably just like, why is TohoLossword collabing with this random VTuber?

33
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,340
Well, I kind of like Toho a little bit.

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm new here, but you're really neat and I like you.

35
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,840
Thanks!

36
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,820
Screen person, yeah.

37
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,700
It's been a long journey for me with Toho.

38
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
So I... how long have I been in Toho for?

39
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,820
A long time!

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,220
I can... hold on, I have to look this up.

41
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,900
Oh gosh, I might be aging myself real bad.

42
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,540
So...

43
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,400
I can remember when UFO was released.

44
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Like, I remember...

45
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,300
When UFO...

46
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,260
That's how long...

47
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,080
Wow, no way.

48
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,240
No way.

49
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,180
That's way too long.

50
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,640
You don't have to admit that.

51
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm trying to...

52
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,300
It's my credibility points.

53
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,780
I also aged with this.

54
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,740
Not so long.

55
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,800
Credibility earned.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,740
Yippee!

57
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
Yeah, so...

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
How's the granny voice?

59
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,460
It's not a granny voice.

60
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,900
I prefer Rugrat voice.

61
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,220
But...

62
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,600
I started with Toho, you know, kind of like maybe most people.

63
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,760
Where it's like I would listen to like the IOSYS covers and everything.

64
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,180
And then I'd be like, these girls are so cute!

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,540
I want to know more!

66
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,820
And...

67
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,440
You know, everybody has listened to Overdrive and Murase Stole the Precious Thing and everything.

68
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,940
So I started with those.

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
I remember very specifically, like...

70
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,340
Overdrive, like, changed my brain chemistry.

71
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,700
So I was like, wow.

72
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,360
My first was Bad Apple.

73
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm sure that's a lot of people's first.

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Now Bad Apple is like a meme, right?

75
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,380
As for games...

76
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
Oh gosh.

77
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I can confidently say I've beat...

78
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,300
Like a handful of them.

79
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,940
Could I do that nowadays?

80
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,980
Probably not.

81
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,300
But...

82
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,540
You know...

83
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,860
I did then.

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,940
I earned my badge back in the day.

85
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,160
Mine was Nekomiko Reimu.

86
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,340
Nekomiko Reimu, I love you.

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,040
Nekomiko Reimu, what are you doing?

88
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,380
But one thing amazing about Touhou Last Word is they also have so much great music, right?

89
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,940
Touhou is not even just the games, but it's the music, it's the community, it's everything that...

90
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,940
Touhou is such like a...

91
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,820
Oh my gosh.

92
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,070
It's such a...

93
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,500
How do you say?

94
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Like its own culture, I would say.

95
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,100
Its influence has been seen everywhere.

96
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,480
And so honestly, I'm just so honored to be sponsored by Touhou Last Word.

97
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm so, so honored because I truly believe that my true otaku journey started when I got into Touhou.

98
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Because when I got into Touhou, it was like...

99
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Then I also got more into like Nico Nico Douga and kind of the subsets of the otaku...

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,180
Like...

101
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,640
Otaku...

102
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,260
Culture.

103
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,840
So, you know, it's really...

104
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,740
It's really a series that is so precious to my heart.

105
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,280
For me...

106
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,560
Gateway Drug.

107
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,880
The Ronald McDonald mess.

108
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,940
But for Touhou Last Word...

109
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,180
Actually, well, I guess there might be some people that are like, I don't really know what Touhou is.

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,540
You told us you got into Touhou via Danboru.

111
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,980
Well, that too.

112
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,160
Well, that's how I like...

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay.

114
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,420
Yes, I mean, I found like the characters on there.

115
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,280
That's how I like was like, oh my gosh, these girls are so cute.

116
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,540
I was kind of like, what is this?

117
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
You have the music, you have the characters, what?

118
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
Everything combined.

119
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,880
Do you have any Fumos?

120
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah, well, okay.

121
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,060
Oh my gosh, I have Bimbo Ghost Fumo.

122
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,320
I have Bimbo Ghost Fumo.

123
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,340
She is...

124
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,280
She is on my...

125
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,120
She is on my shelf.

126
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,300
Currently.

127
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,380
As for...

128
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,540
I used to have a Rei Mufumo.

129
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,240
I don't know where it is anymore though.

130
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,960
I don't know, maybe she got lost.

131
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
I used to have one.

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,200
It left.

133
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,620
She is off fighting...

134
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,940
She is off saving the weather.

135
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Or something.

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Something weird.

137
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,520
The weather is acting up again in Gensokyo.

138
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,460
She had to...

139
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,840
She is off to her home planet.

140
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,780
For those who don't really know what Touhou is.

141
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Touhou is a collection of games.

142
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,160
And just all sorts of different kind of media.

143
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,140
Started as games.

144
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,640
Now there is like, you know.

145
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,940
It's kind of grown into...

146
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,160
All sorts of...

147
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
There is novels.

148
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,380
There is...

149
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,820
There is a limitless amount of doujinshi.

150
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,680
There is music.

151
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,480
There is everything.

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,380
The games are...

153
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,580
Started as like a bullet hell thing.

154
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,660
Game series.

155
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:17,980
Sorry.

156
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I have sick brain.

157
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,040
So my...

158
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,360
So my thought process is a little...

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
A little off today.

160
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,720
So I apologize.

161
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,240
But...

162
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,260
Unlimited doujin works.

163
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,660
Yeah.

164
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,320
There is so much.

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,840
And...

166
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,800
It's just...

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,660
It's a whole culture of its own.

168
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,580
But I find that, you know.

169
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,740
As much as there is of Touhou.

170
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,820
It's...

171
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,380
I wouldn't say it's too difficult to get into.

172
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,940
Because...

173
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,200
You know.

174
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,340
You have the canon of the games and everything.

175
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,320
But then...

176
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,280
Like...

177
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,340
And then there is, of course.

178
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,920
Like I said.

179
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,500
The novels too.

180
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,660
Which I do have.

181
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,780
A signed...

182
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,940
Actually I have two signed ZUN things.

183
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,980
I have one of the soundtracks.

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,540
And then I have one of the novels.

185
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,400
From when I met ZUN before.

186
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,640
So...

187
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Yes.

188
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,620
I have things.

189
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,860
But...

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
I wouldn't say it's so difficult.

191
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Because the fanon has also created...

192
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,460
There are different aspects of the fanon.

193
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,180
So...

194
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,540
Honestly.

195
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,560
Getting into Touhou.

196
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,380
You can really just kind of...

197
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,280
Go in anywhere.

198
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,160
You can be like...

199
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,120
I wanna start with the music.

200
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,620
And if you only like the music.

201
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,060
If you're like...

202
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm not really much of a gamer.

203
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,260
You can just listen to the music.

204
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,760
If you wanna play the games.

205
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,520
You can play the games.

206
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,740
You know, it's just...

207
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,560
Who is my most fave character in Touhou?

208
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,900
I must say that I am very...

209
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
I am very partial to...

210
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,160
I love her so much.

211
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,580
But...

212
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,320
I also love Patchouli.

213
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,500
I love Kogasa.

214
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,020
But also I have characters...

215
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,180
Okay.

216
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,200
Does anyone else have characters that they like?

217
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
And then characters that they love for their theme of?

218
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,380
You know what I mean?

219
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,720
Like for characters that I really love their theme song.

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,460
I love Patchouli for her character.

221
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,540
But I also love her theme.

222
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
And then I also love...

223
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,180
I love Byakuren for her theme song.

224
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,400
And then I also love...

225
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,960
Kanako for her theme song.

226
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
Honestly, I love...

227
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,920
Boss theme songs so much.

228
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,720
They're so good.

229
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,620
But...

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,180
Locked Girl is a great theme.

231
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah!

232
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,460
Cool and Create has a...

233
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,140
Has a version of the song that I really, really like.

234
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Rainy Girl.

235
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,700
So...

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,760
So...

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,340
You know...

238
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,840
But I think Kogasa is just...

239
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,060
She's the cutest thing ever.

240
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,980
She's...

241
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,100
She's always trying to spook me.

242
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,700
And I love that about her.

243
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,220
And then Patchouli is just so cute.

244
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,280
And of course, Remilia is just the cutest ever.

245
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,220
Remilia.

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,320
So...

247
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,900
So I explained Touhou a little bit.

249
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,420
Touhou lost word.

250
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,380
Since that's what we're all here for today.

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,080
It's actually...

252
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,420
So it's like a licensed RPG.

253
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,640
Featuring the characters of Touhou Project.

254
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,820
So it isn't like, you know...

255
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,380
It's a Touhou...

256
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
It's like an official Touhou game.

257
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,580
And you know, you get all the characters.

258
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,460
You get to see them.

259
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,820
What's so fun is you get to see them in different outfits.

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,360
And you know, they experience all sorts of different kind of...

261
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
You know...

262
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,520
Kooky situations as things happen in Gensokyo.

263
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,820
The Touhou lost word costumes are actually insane.

264
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,580
I don't know if anyone saw like the night designs and everything.

265
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,580
It's so...

266
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,700
They're so...

267
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm like...

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,760
They're like...

269
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,520
If you want your character...

270
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,740
If you want your favorite character in an outfit...

271
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,260
It will probably appear in lost word.

272
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,240
They're so fun.

273
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
All the designs are so good.

274
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,200
Armor journal, yeah!

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
It's so...

276
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
Oh my gosh, it's so cool.

277
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,840
And I remember they had...

278
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh my gosh.

279
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,320
Like, there's also all colors of the characters and everything.

280
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,640
It's so...

281
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
There's so much in there.

282
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,080
We'll get into the game in just a minute.

283
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,900
Yeah, so you...

284
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,320
You know, you collect your characters.

285
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,420
You got your...

286
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,160
You got your girls.

287
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
You got your friends.

288
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Your friends in Gensokyo.

289
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,940
And then you can collect items to enhance your units.

290
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,720
For when you head into battle, baby.

291
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,340
So, yeah.

292
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,380
Before I open up the game though...

293
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,940
Do you guys want to hear a preview?

294
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,440
I mean, it was already posted.

295
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
The preview of my...

296
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,300
Of my cover song for the game.

297
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,520
But do you want to hear it again?

298
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,620
Do you want to hear it before it's released?

299
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,600
Just the...

300
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,280
Just the...

301
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,140
Just the preview.

302
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,680
Okay.

303
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,780
Preview.

304
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,320
Preview.

305
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,680
Preview.

306
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,400
This is...

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,740
And then you'll hear what I actually sound like if this is your first time hearing me.

308
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,980
Instead of a squeaky rugrat.

309
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,720
You'll hear my actual voice.

310
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,080
Okey dokey.

311
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,320
Preview.

312
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,940
Start!

313
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,400
Preview.

314
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,320
It's actually quite embarrassing listening.

315
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,220
It's actually quite embarrassing.

316
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,260
Listening to...

317
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,100
Listening to myself.

318
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,060
No, I want the full thing.

319
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,720
Well, the full thing will be...

320
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,080
Premiering...

321
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,400
In...

322
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,140
40 minutes, actually!

323
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,740
Hold on.

324
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Hold on.

325
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,200
Watch...

326
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,720
We'll watch the premiere together.

327
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,520
But let me post a link real quick.

328
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,180
Watch the premiere...

329
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,780
Here.

330
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,800
And let me pin this.

331
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,880
Pin, pin, pin.

332
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,040
40 minutes!

333
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,040
So, a lot of people are just like, Oh my gosh.

334
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,300
For those who don't know, I'm kind of obsessed.

335
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm very kind of brain-rotted with a certain series of games that involves the Medalist of Gears.

336
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,420
And of course, my name is Mint Phantom.

337
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:12,720
So I was like, when the Lost Word team came to me, they were like, we want to collab with you on a song.

338
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,560
And they asked if I would like...

339
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:25,180
You know, they were like, you can choose the song that you want to sing from the songs that we have released.

340
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:34,400
And I was like, not gonna lie, I was bouncing between a couple because there were some other songs that I really, really liked.

341
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,300
But in the end, I was like, I have to do Phantom Pain.

342
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:56,840
It's literally made for me, but I also was kind of, you know, I was nervous about it because I'm not so attached to Kasen as a character so much.

343
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,300
So I was nervous about that.

344
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,460
But also, I love the original version so, so much because I'm a really, really big fan of the singer who does the original, Kotoko.

345
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,460
I really love Kotoko-san.

346
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,100
I've been a huge fan of hers for as long as I've loved Touhou, probably.

347
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:25,040
So, I was like, I don't know if I can do this version justice, but hopefully you guys like my version too.

348
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,600
And the song itself is like, oh my gosh, it was so much fun to sing.

349
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,600
It was so actually kind of difficult because it was very fast.

350
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:43,860
And it took me about like four hours just to record.

351
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,540
Just to record the one song took me about four hours.

352
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:59,280
And I ended up recording the whole thing and then I was listening back to it and I was like, no, I think I need to...

353
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,320
I think I need to...

354
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,020
I need to redo all the choruses because I didn't feel like they were...

355
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,760
they had enough oomph to them.

356
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,640
So I was just like, okay, back into the recording booth I go.

357
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,300
So I...

358
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,960
Phantom Pain is my favorite song in Lost Word.

359
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,320
Yeah!

360
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,520
Let's go!

361
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,020
I do want to show a bit of the songs that I wanted to sing today.

362
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,880
I was originally going to do a karaoke, but obviously, as you can hear,

363
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,920
that didn't end up working out so well.

364
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,000
But I want to show off some of the songs I was going to sing if that's okay because Lost Word has some amazing...

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,700
Oh my gosh, some amazing collabs and songs and everything.

366
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,460
And it's just...

367
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,940
Oh gosh!

368
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,320
They're so...

369
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,220
They're so...

370
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,760
They have collabed with too many artists that I love.

371
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,860
Will we get a Touhou karaoke at some point in the future?

372
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,500
That's a great question!

373
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:23,000
Because they said that just because I couldn't sing it today, I can sing these songs in the future.

374
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,220
So...

375
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,720
I can sing them in the future.

376
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,840
In future karaoke.

377
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,460
So even if you don't hear them, me singing them today, you might hear them one day.

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Let me pull it up and then I'll open up the game because I want to get my song in the game, you guys!

379
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
I want to get my song in the game.

380
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,820
Well, I say my song, my cover song.

381
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,260
One moment...

382
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,500
Let me put this down here.

383
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,200
Here.

384
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,060
Okay.

385
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:14,600
So the first song was one of the songs I actually considered doing as the cover song because because I really love this artist.

386
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:27,680
And it's a collaboration between, of course, legendary Touhou artist AYOSES and the queen of Akihabara herself, Momoi Haruko!

387
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,380
And so I was like, oh my gosh.

388
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Oh my gosh, this is made for me.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
So one second, I think...

390
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,160
Oh God, hold on.

391
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,560
It might be kind of loud for a second.

392
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,440
One second.

393
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,160
Oh gosh.

394
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,480
AYOSES, Momoi Haruko!

395
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,120
And of course, it's Patchouli!

396
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,260
I was like, all three of these things make me want to sing it.

397
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,440
Momoi Haruko's voice is just...

398
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,040
Oh my gosh, it feels like...

399
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,320
It feels like such, like an old school cover.

400
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,820
Like I could see this on Nico Nico Douga back in the day.

401
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,330
Bring back Tei!

402
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,750
Tei!

403
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,910
Let

404
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,560
me get my desk too so you guys can see.

405
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,140
It's such a cute song.

406
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,590
Haruko's voice is so perfect.

407
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,830
I love it.

408
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,970
I was like, I don't think I can do this song justice either.

409
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,370
That's my girl!

410
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,650
The art is so pretty.

411
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,870
So cute.

412
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,580
I'll try and sing it in the future.

413
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,910
Ah, I'm so obsessed with this song.

414
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,470
I'm so obsessed.

415
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,940
I've sung Haruko's songs in karaoke before.

416
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,220
Well, I guess only once.

417
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,140
But she's like, legendary queen of Akihabara.

418
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm so obsessed with this song.

419
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,480
Oh no, more than one.

420
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,210
There are quite a number of characters in Touhou, huh?

421
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,780
So cute!

422
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,120
So, so cute!

423
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,480
I love that one so much.

424
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,100
Oh my gosh.

425
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,500
I love that one so much.

426
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,780
And then, earlier I mentioned, I mentioned Byakuren, right?

427
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,460
I really...

428
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,940
This is the right one, right?

429
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,540
This is the right one.

431
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,800
I mentioned really loving Byakuren's theme, so I also considered doing this one.

432
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:34,980
Oh, and before I continue too, for the music videos, for these songs, what's really cool is that the music video characters each have their own story in the game that takes place in their own world.

433
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,400
It's in the game, it's in a Touhou Lost Word called, in a part called Ruins of Memory.

434
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:53,960
So, you know, once you clear the story, most of the time clearing it will provide the player, you, with the character for that story.

435
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,700
So if you're just like, oh, I play this, and then you can get to that character once you, you know, so if you like the song, you can also...

436
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
Yeah, yeah, you, the player!

437
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,480
You, the player, you're the player.

438
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:18,080
So I mentioned liking Byakuren's theme earlier, so I also considered doing this one for the cover too, but I also really just wanted to sing it in the karaoke.

439
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm so sorry my voice is like this today, I'm so sorry.

440
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,920
But we can at least listen to the beautiful original too.

441
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,820
It's so pretty.

442
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,720
The art is so pretty.

443
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,900
Holy again, that's me.

444
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,400
I'm becoming an angel.

445
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,860
So pretty!

446
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
So pretty.

447
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,560
And you can listen to all these covers on their YouTube channel as well.

448
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,240
The Lost Word YouTube channel.

449
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
They have a whole playlist of all of them.

450
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,860
English.

451
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,280
Ikinari Eigo.

452
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,700
It's so pretty.

453
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,580
I've listened to this one so much.

454
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,940
Oh my god, it's so good.

455
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh, it's so good.

456
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,100
And the

457
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,640
visuals!

458
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,060
Sorry, I'm freaking out.

459
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:36,600
It's so pretty, oh my gosh.

460
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,160
I can't.

461
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,640
She looks so awesome.

462
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,580
I love it.

463
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,920
I love Byakuren so much.

464
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,900
Oh my god.

465
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,810
Me too, I'm on the bike.

466
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,820
Oh my god.

467
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,260
Sorry, I stopped talking.

468
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,260
I was just vibing so much.

469
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,120
Sorry.

470
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
I just love this song so much.

471
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
We're behind them.

472
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,040
How did I hold that note for so long though?

473
00:33:59,600 --> 00:33:59,920
Oh.

474
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,040
It's just so beautiful, I can't.

475
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,780
This one feels like a clown.

476
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,300
Yeah!

477
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,860
I feel like...

478
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,240
This one deserves more recognition.

479
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,200
It's just so pretty.

480
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,960
Byakuren's so cute.

481
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,820
Sorry.

482
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,220
Oh my gosh.

483
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,180
It's so...

484
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
It's just so...

485
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,300
Actually...

486
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,120
I used to cosplay Touhou quite a bit actually.

487
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,620
A long time ago.

488
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,000
I mean, I've been in Touhou for so long.

489
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,500
But...

490
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't think she was my first cosplay.

491
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,380
I can't remember who I cosplayed first.

492
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,100
But...

493
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,000
I cosplayed Nui.

494
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,100
At one point.

495
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,900
I used to make them all myself.

496
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,280
I cosplayed Nui.

497
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,780
I cosplayed Mistia.

498
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,580
I cosplayed Chen.

499
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,000
I cosplayed...

500
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,360
Who else?

501
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,980
Uh...

502
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,470
Uh...

503
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,080
Uh...

504
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,420
I can't remember.

505
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,900
It's been so long.

506
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,200
Mistia?

507
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:11,680
Nui?

508
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,180
Chen?

509
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,940
I actually never did familiar.

510
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,200
Okay guys, I can't...

511
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,380
This is like so silly maybe.

512
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,500
But I usually don't cosplay characters that I...

513
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,340
Love like my favorite characters.

514
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,160
Because I don't think I can pull it off.

515
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm like...

516
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,400
If I cosplayed Remilia, I would do her such disservice.

517
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,980
She is too cute for me to cosplay.

518
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,420
I cosplayed Momiji.

519
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,040
I cosplayed Momiji.

520
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
I cosplayed Aya.

521
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,780
I cosplayed Shameimaru.

522
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,500
So...

523
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,940
I've done quite a few cosplays actually.

525
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,560
Oh, I also...

526
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
Thank you guys for all the superchats and everything.

527
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,920
Because I got so many things to go through today.

528
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,380
We only have 20 minutes left before the premiere of the cover.

529
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm not reading right now, but...

530
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,360
Thank you everybody.

531
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,240
Thank you so much.

532
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,700
I really, really appreciate it.

533
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
Yeah, so...

534
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,540
Yeah, I've done...

535
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,500
I think that's all of them though.

536
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,460
Maybe.

537
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,360
I can't remember now.

538
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,540
Maybe that's all of them.

539
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
Of the Touhou cosplays.

540
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,240
But like I said, I used to do quite a bit of Touhou cosplay.

541
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:35,960
So...

542
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Yeah.

543
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,920
Okay, I have one more song.

544
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,380
I think.

545
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,940
That I was going to sing.

546
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,580
That I can show.

547
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,300
Well, actually I think there was two.

548
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,360
But I'm just...

549
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,340
Maybe we can...

550
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,540
I won't do the whole thing.

551
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,060
For these two next songs.

552
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,580
So you can go look them.

553
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,180
You can go...

554
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,360
If you like it, you can go find it on...

555
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
On their channel.

556
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,260
The next one is called Toki no Kyoukai.

557
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,720
Oh, sorry.

558
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,740
The first one.

559
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,560
The first song.

560
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,360
The Momoi Haruko one was...

561
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,540
Precious...

562
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,460
Precious...

563
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:18,740
Word.

564
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,660
Sorry.

565
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,440
Tee tee.

566
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,360
Tee tee.

567
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,660
And so...

568
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,880
That was the first one.

569
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,200
And then the other one we just listened to was Holy again.

570
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,640
And then this one is Toki no Kyoukai.

571
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,220
And...

572
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,660
Toki no Kyoukai is...

573
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,920
Is...

574
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,500
Yuyuko.

575
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Sorry, I was like...

576
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,240
Is Yuyuko's theme.

577
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,740
So I was also just like...

578
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,120
Maybe I should cover this one.

579
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,360
Because, you know...

580
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,440
Ghost and ghost.

581
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,360
But also...

582
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,000
Because the singer of this song is another singer that I really, really love.

583
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,720
And really, really respect.

584
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,720
Ito Kanako-san.

585
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,780
Who...

586
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,600
If you recognize her name...

587
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,360
She did, you know, the...

588
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,600
The...

589
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,660
Opening for Steins Gate.

590
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,240
So let's listen to this one.

591
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,920
We won't do the full thing of this one though.

592
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,520
Sorry.

593
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:14,620
Sorry.

594
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,960
But this one is so...

595
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,720
It's so funky and fun.

596
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,500
I love it.

597
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,720
As you can see, like...

598
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,360
Mossberg collab with like...

599
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,300
In my opinion, the best of the best.

600
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,840
Because they're all my favorite artists.

601
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,480
To me, it's like a dream collaboration always.

602
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,840
And I would say that...

603
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,240
Even if I wasn't getting paid.

604
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,820
Gosh, it feels so...

605
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,520
It fuels my otaku soul.

606
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,060
I love the animation in this one too.

607
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,260
I wanna keep watching.

608
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,460
But I wouldn't have time for other stuff.

609
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,800
Okay.

610
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,580
I don't wanna pause it.

611
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,880
But yeah, so that...

612
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,560
Oh my gosh.

613
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,240
It's so great.

614
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,860
Oh my gosh, it's such a jam.

615
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,060
Need the link to that song.

616
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,200
Like I said, you can find all of these songs on the Toho Last Word YouTube channel.

617
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,180
Or get them in the game.

618
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,240
Or get them in the game, everybody.

619
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,920
And then you can listen to it as your home screen.

620
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,660
Yeah, did I mention that my cover song and all these songs...

621
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:09,680
You can set as your background music for the home screen of Toho Last Word.

622
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,420
So when you open up your game every time, you can hear these songs.

623
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,920
Or you could hear yours truly.

624
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,240
On the starting screen of the game.

625
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,220
Yeah, baby!

626
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,320
Now the last song is a bit selfish of a song, actually.

627
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,600
I was like, probably...

628
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,120
Maybe like...

629
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,600
Not very many people in the chat will know these artists.

630
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,920
But to me, it means the world to have these artists sing.

631
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,620
So the last song is a duet, actually.

632
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,800
Between...

633
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:04,060
Between a singer who was in an idol group that I recently went to Japan for.

634
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,360
Well, I literally got back yesterday.

635
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,660
But the idol group she was in disbanded this past weekend.

636
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,060
And her name is Naruse Ami!

637
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:25,000
And she helps with the Japanese livestreams for Lost Word.

638
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,280
And the other singer is Shioringo!

639
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,500
From another idol group that I like called Banja Naimon!

640
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,720
And so they did a collab together for this song.

641
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,300
And this song also feels like very...

642
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,560
Super like...

643
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,000
Old school Toho!

644
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,540
So, like...

645
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,920
Well, I mean...

646
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,480
You know what I mean.

647
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,060
Like the old Niconico Douga videos that you would watch.

648
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,220
It just feels so good.

649
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,260
So, let's listen.

650
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,840
That's my selfish...

651
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,140
It's my selfish request to listen to this one.

652
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,600
And

653
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,050
of course I...

654
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,110
That's like...

655
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,510
This is a dream made...

656
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,670
Dream collab for me!

657
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,570
Ah!

658
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,430
Their voices are so good!

659
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,590
They blend so well together.

660
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,330
Oh my god, their voices blend amazing.

661
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,550
Mountain of Faith has my favorite beats.

662
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,750
Like my favorite soundtrack.

663
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,650
But I think Imperishable Night is second for me.

664
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,150
I really love the music in Imperishable Night.

665
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,270
Ah, it's so hard!

666
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,970
I feel like I always switch.

667
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,940
I don't wanna stop it.

668
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,060
I don't wanna stop it.

669
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,080
Okay, we'll listen to this one.

670
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,240
There's only a minute left, it's fine.

671
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,020
The best part is too is...

672
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,760
Lost Word has also collabed with another member of Denpakomi.

673
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,880
Nemoto Nagi.

674
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,960
So, I'm just like...

675
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,660
I'm like...

676
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,720
This game is like made for me.

677
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:48,020
And of course, I can't bring up a song that Itaso sings in without also bringing up the fact that I went to the Lost Word offices.

678
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,360
I posted on this on Twitter, but if you don't have Twitter...

679
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,680
I went to...

680
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,360
One second, wait.

681
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,420
I went...

682
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,860
There we go.

683
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,940
I went to the Lost Word office.

684
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,320
You can see me on the couch there, I'm sitting there.

685
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,200
And...

686
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,380
It was really cool to see where they do the live streams and everything.

687
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,160
I was like...

688
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,460
But...

689
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,520
The team there is just so nice.

690
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,560
I'm so grateful for this, look guys.

691
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,320
They gifted me...

692
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,600
A Shikishi.

693
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,740
Signed to me...

694
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,680
By Itaso!

695
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,340
Oh my gosh, I almost started crying when I got this.

696
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:36,910
I was like...

697
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,860
Oh gosh.

698
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,720
I'm so...

699
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,460
That's...

700
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,640
Signed to me.

701
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,940
She even wrote on the back.

702
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,120
She wrote like...

703
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,940
Let's keep loving Touhou Lost Word together.

704
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,360
I want a Shikishi signed by Minto.

705
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,840
Well...

706
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,760
Funny you should mention that, huh?

707
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,740
Funny you should mention that, huh?

708
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,480
Because...

709
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,980
Because...

710
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,640
My head.

711
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,260
My big old head is blocking it.

712
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,040
There is a New Year's giveaway!

713
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,720
So if you log in 14 days into the game...

714
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,600
And reply to the campaign post on Twitter...

715
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,720
Or ex-formerly known as Twitter...

716
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,000
With the screenshot of you having logged in...

717
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,980
And hashtag LWMint.

718
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,060
Mint.

719
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,480
LWMint.

720
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,040
LWMint.

721
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,600
You have a chance to win my signature!

722
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,580
And...

723
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,540
Fumo!

724
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,440
Everybody's beloved Fumo Fumo.

725
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,160
Actually, that's why I went to the office.

726
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,100
Because I went and I went and signed all the Shikishi.

727
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,860
And I was like...

728
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,120
I felt very awkward.

729
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,560
Well, not because of them.

730
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,540
But because I was like...

731
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,820
This is so strange.

732
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,560
I've never signed Shikishi like this before.

733
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,880
It was kind of...

734
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,380
It was nervous for me.

735
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,020
You have until the 31st of this month, January.

736
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,000
You can...

737
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,140
You still have time.

738
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,080
You still have time to...

739
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,120
To...

740
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,560
Get into the game.

741
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,980
So...

742
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,140
Now...

743
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,440
We have about 8 minutes until the premiere.

744
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,340
I do want to...

745
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,220
I obviously have the game up.

746
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,200
I want to do some gacha and stuff too.

747
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,140
Let's maybe save the gacha for...

748
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,120
After...

749
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,560
The premiere.

750
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,200
But let's open up the game still.

751
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,550
Wait a second.

752
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,410
I got to get my...

753
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,090
I got to get my iPad.

754
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,070
Let's go gambling.

755
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,950
Let's go gambling.

756
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,710
Dang it.

757
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:37,510
Actually, no.

758
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,350
Every character is...

759
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:41,350
Is precious.

760
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:42,830
Every friend...

761
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,410
Everyone is a friend, right?

762
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,550
Except when you're trying to get a specific friend.

763
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,210
Alright.

764
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:54,210
One moment.

765
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,950
Can you guys hear that?

766
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,050
You guys can hear that, right?

767
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,790
Let me know if you can hear the game.

768
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:16,390
Oh,

769
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,860
that's why.

770
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,920
Oh, you guys couldn't hear the music this whole time?

771
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,380
I'm so sorry.

772
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,220
I just realized that I had music playing, you guys.

773
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,620
And you couldn't hear it.

774
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

775
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,720
You just heard the silence.

776
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,520
That's a little scuff.

777
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,060
I apologize for my scuff.

778
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,120
We heard the songs.

779
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,360
Okay, at least you heard the songs.

780
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,200
No, I had like a BGM going.

781
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,140
While I was just talking.

782
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,410
Okay, one thing that is my favorite part probably about Lost Word...

783
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,340
Is the sheer amount of stuff they give you.

784
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,180
So I haven't opened it up for today.

785
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,800
I opened it up for yesterday.

786
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:10,800
But...

787
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,100
But...

788
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,760
Let's see how many notifications we got.

789
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,700
This is so...

790
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,040
It's always so funny.

791
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,360
And then of course we'll get...

792
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,440
First thing.

793
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,000
Yippee!

794
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:32,960
Sparer points.

795
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,740
Gimme gimme.

796
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,580
Gimme gimme.

797
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,700
We're getting BGM.

798
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,740
But this is not my BGM.

799
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,820
Not my BGM.

800
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,720
Thank you, Flan.

801
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:53,920
More BGM!

802
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,300
More BGM.

803
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,240
Thank you, Koishi.

804
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,090
Thank you, Kene.

805
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,050
More stuff?

806
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,750
What's next?

807
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:19,250
Oh my god, I love Nazrin.

808
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,550
She is so cute.

809
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,190
Nazrin is precious.

810
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,010
More stuff?

811
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:24,510
What's next?

812
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,810
Yeah!

813
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,260
Yeah, more stuff!

814
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:32,880
Yeah!

815
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,040
More...

816
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,260
Yeah!

817
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,860
Oh my god, wait.

818
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,160
There's Kasen.

819
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,720
Bonus simulator.

820
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,580
For real, there is so much free stuff.

821
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,840
And this is...

822
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,480
The best part is that this is like...

823
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,900
This is like all the time.

824
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,780
More stuff!

825
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,660
That's me!

826
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,660
Oh my god!

827
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:09,980
Mom!

828
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,620
Mom, I'm in the game!

829
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,020
That's it!

830
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,060
Phantom Pain!

831
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,580
Everybody wins!

832
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,580
You guys, look.

833
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,680
You can win your own yukkuri cushion.

834
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,400
Look, look, look, look.

835
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,080
Look how cute they are.

836
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,540
They are so proud.

837
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,000
I really like the Marisa one because she looks so...

838
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,400
Actually, no, I like them both.

839
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,580
Oh,

840
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,040
time to roll.

841
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,660
Okay guys, let's see.

842
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,820
The only man in Gensokyo.

843
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,830
100!

844
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,830
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna get it.

845
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:24,860
Tomorrow.

846
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,180
Alright.

847
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,500
That's me!

848
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,460
You guys should all...

849
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,460
You guys should all...

850
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,560
Tap to watch, of course.

851
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,260
Look!

852
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,280
We have Remilia in the game!

853
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,740
And then...

854
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,300
Of course, we have her theme.

855
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,520
Of course, we have her theme as my home screen.

856
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,800
Because we have made Remilia.

857
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,560
One minute!

858
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,320
I'm so

859
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,600
proud!

860
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,300
Okay, hold on.

861
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,220
I'm also jamming to this.

862
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,280
Okay, see you.

863
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,640
Bye bye for a second, Ojoisama.

864
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,920
Okay, hold on.

865
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,320
Let me pull up the premiere.

866
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,860
I have the YouTube.

867
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,000
I have the YouTube.

868
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,920
And then I have the link, of course.

869
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,260
I'm so nervous!

870
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,340
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous!

871
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,480
I'm nervous.

872
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm nervous.

873
00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,540
I'm nervous.

874
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:00,580
I'm nervous.

875
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,140
I'm nervous.

876
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,100
I'm nervous.

877
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,040
Loud!

878
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,120
Oh my gosh, loud.

879
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,700
YouTube, why do you do the way that you do?

880
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,920
Why are you the way that you are?

881
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,320
Oh wait, hold on.

882
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,860
Sorry, I'm setting up the video.

883
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,440
So we can watch it.

884
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,260
Okay, that should be good.

885
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,610
That should be good.

886
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,850
I'm nervous.

887
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,950
I'm nervous!

888
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,570
The background music is so loud.

889
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,690
I know, I even turned it down.

890
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:53,450
I'll turn it down a little bit more.

891
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:59,810
I'm nervous!

892
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,550
I'm nervous!

893
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,090
Oh gosh, I hope you guys like it.

894
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,150
45 seconds.

895
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,330
45 seconds.

896
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,930
I'll turn it up, don't worry, once it starts.

897
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:29,270
But for now, we'll have it not so loud.

898
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:33,830
I'm nervous.

899
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:35,990
25.

900
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,230
I might shut up though.

901
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,650
So you guys can just listen to it.

902
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,150
Oh god,

903
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:49,770
here we go!

904
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,350
Here we go!

905
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,450
Just pretend I'm singing it right now.

906
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,150
That's me!

907
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,440
Oh, sweet dreams.

908
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,940
Ah, here we go!

909
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,100
Ah, the outfits.

910
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,480
I'm nervous.

911
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,760
That's so cute!

912
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,340
So pretty!

913
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,010
I'm

914
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,150
nervous.

915
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,410
No!

916
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:38,040
No!

917
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,080
I'm nervous.

918
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,790
Wow, Phantom Pain!

919
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,990
Ah, that's me!

920
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,210
That's me!

921
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:34,890
That's

922
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:50,290
me!

923
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:57,110
Oh gosh.

924
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,790
Embarrassed.

925
01:05:58,890 --> 01:05:59,650
So embarrassed.

926
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,270
Yay!

927
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,150
It's such an awesome song.

928
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,930
It's such an awesome song.

929
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,870
I'm so honored to have been able to sing it.

930
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,050
Yay!

931
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:14,410
Yay!

932
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,210
I hope you guys liked it.

933
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,170
I hope you guys liked it.

934
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,790
And please repeat it over and over and over again.

935
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,950
Or, also, get it in the game!

936
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,370
Let's go back to the game now.

937
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,710
Oh, it's a Phantom Pain.

938
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,130
Well, hide it in the rain.

939
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,670
Well, Phantom Pain.

940
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:41,050
Of course I sound like, so stinky right now, but...

941
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:48,690
Yay!

942
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,270
Hello, clown piece.

943
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,290
This is the original!

944
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,570
I love Kotoko so much.

945
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,590
Alrighty!

946
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:15,630
So, of course, we have to pull, right?

947
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,650
They did provide this...

948
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:27,410
They did provide this account for me.

949
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,530
Don't get too jealous if I pull something that you really wanted.

950
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,550
But I want to see what friends we have too.

951
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,290
Okay, so this is who we're starting with, right?

952
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,050
This is who we're starting with.

953
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,110
I'm so upset.

954
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,170
Oh gosh, look at her in the background and everything.

955
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,290
Look how cute she is.

956
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,190
She's so noble.

957
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,250
She's so cute.

958
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,010
Remilia-sama!

959
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:03,910
Remilia-sama!

960
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:05,610
She's so cute.

961
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:10,450
Okay.

962
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:20,690
I'm kind of obsessed with these song choices.

963
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,790
Alright.

964
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,350
So, as you can see, for the New Years...

965
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,310
We have...

966
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,930
Blue Reimu!

967
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:36,230
And...

968
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:36,510
Ta-da!

969
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,950
Red Marisa!

970
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,130
Oh my gosh, aren't they so...

971
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:41,610
Oh my God, I can't...

972
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:44,370
I kind of love characters that have, like...

973
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,470
You know how, like, on New Years they have...

974
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,470
They, like, draw on their faces and everything.

975
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:49,830
I...

976
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:52,630
I'm so cute.

977
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,390
Claim your mail!

978
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,910
I probably should wear this over there.

979
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,610
There it is!

980
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:18,210
Ta-da!

981
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:20,050
Koishi!

982
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:22,550
Let it rain.

983
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,310
Oh my gosh.

984
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,710
More friends!

985
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:28,570
More?

986
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,650
Oh my gosh.

987
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,770
I'm so rich.

988
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,390
Koishi.

989
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:40,510
For the...

990
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,730
For the...

991
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,610
The New Years...

992
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,890
I really want to get...

993
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,570
I really want to try and get both of them.

994
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,030
So...

995
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:57,950
There's, like, a little bit of a backstory behind why there's, like, Blue Reimu and Blue Marisa.

996
01:09:59,410 --> 01:09:59,850
But...

997
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:01,230
Essentially...

998
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,270
Like...

999
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,470
It's, like, different universe...

1000
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,530
Reimu and Marisa.

1001
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,570
And, like...

1002
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:08,950
Yukari.

1003
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,590
She, like, sends them off...

1004
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,150
To explore other worlds and stuff.

1005
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,050
So...

1006
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,930
It's kind of cute.

1007
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,410
Good luck on your pulls.

1008
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,550
07.

1009
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,170
07 for our...

1010
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,510
I mean, look at how much...

1011
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,450
I think I have...

1012
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:26,190
I think I have enough to pull them.

1013
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,070
I'm not gonna lie.

1014
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,490
Another thing that I really love about Lost Word is...

1015
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:33,970
And...

1016
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,910
They put so much care into...

1017
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,510
Into, like...

1018
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,190
You know...

1019
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,210
Officially...

1020
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:45,730
The characters don't have, like, official VAs, right?

1021
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,710
Official Seiyuu.

1022
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,450
And...

1023
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,670
There's so much fanon involved in Touhou.

1024
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:57,190
That a lot of people kind of create their own headcanons for characters and...

1025
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,590
Stories and just kind of things like that.

1026
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,270
So that...

1027
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,670
In Lost Word...

1028
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:04,370
For each character...

1029
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,850
Let me see, hold on, let me go back before we do the gacha.

1030
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,710
Let's just do Chirno.

1031
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,270
Hold on, I have to...

1032
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,850
It's so cute.

1033
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,030
Look at all this.

1034
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,250
For each character...

1035
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,210
You can choose a different voice actress.

1036
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:26,590
Up to three!

1037
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,210
Voice actresses, they have...

1038
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:30,210
That, like...

1039
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,210
If you're just like...

1040
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:34,170
This version doesn't really suit the kind of...

1041
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,550
Version in my head that I had for...

1042
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:36,970
Chirno.

1043
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,470
You can switch it!

1044
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:40,370
Hold on.

1045
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,810
Does anyone remember where it's at?

1046
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,270
Sorry, my brain is so...

1047
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,010
And look at all the outfits they have too!

1048
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,310
Wait, this is literally me?

1049
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,230
It's a chocolate maid?

1050
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:54,190
Hello?

1051
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:54,350
Hello?

1052
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,910
It's literally me!

1053
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:10,690
But yeah, so it's just like...

1054
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,790
They really do put a lot of care into...

1055
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:18,650
Making sure everybody has their...

1056
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:20,510
Best Touhou experience!

1057
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,110
Depending on how they enjoy Touhou, right?

1058
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,710
Look at the feet!

1059
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:27,890
Yeah!

1060
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,190
I'm so obsessed with this song, sorry.

1061
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:35,530
Okay.

1062
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,870
Okay.

1063
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:39,170
Alright.

1064
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,150
For real!

1065
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:41,030
For real!

1066
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:42,330
The book?

1067
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:43,130
Oh, thank you.

1068
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,610
Thanks, Mod.

1069
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,010
Sorry, it's been a minute since I've played Touhou Last Word.

1070
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,910
And I'm also sick, so I can't remember anything right now.

1071
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:52,610
Ah, here we go!

1072
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,050
Yeah, yeah.

1073
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,020
Isn't it so awesome?

1074
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,100
They're just a little bit different.

1075
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,660
I like this one.

1076
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,300
So you can do that?

1077
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,920
Let's hear Remilia-sama.

1078
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,800
I really like that one.

1079
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,220
This one's a little bit more like...

1080
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,640
A little more...

1081
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,280
Refined.

1082
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,860
Sounds a little older.

1083
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,560
And this is a good mix of the two.

1084
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,520
I think.

1085
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,440
This one is like a mix between Ojoou and...

1086
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,320
But I like her.

1087
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,880
I like her being bratty.

1088
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,680
I like her being bratty.

1089
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,920
Look at all these costumes!

1090
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,420
Oh my god.

1091
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,280
No!

1092
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,160
I cried.

1093
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,080
Bloody nurse!

1094
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,180
Oh my gosh.

1095
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,320
Triggered.

1096
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:25,900
So cute.

1097
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,640
So good.

1098
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:29,480
So good.

1099
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,100
So, I think that's just such a really cool detail.

1100
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,280
That like...

1101
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,080
You don't really think about for...

1102
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,160
For games, you know?

1103
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,020
Like...

1104
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,420
I mean, usually for like a game...

1105
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,220
It's gonna be...

1106
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,380
Either like...

1107
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,420
If it's like of an already existing property...

1108
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,360
It's gonna be...

1109
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,020
Like this original seiyuu.

1110
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,740
Is this live or recording?

1111
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,220
This is live, baby!

1112
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,500
And for like original series...

1113
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,660
That like become gacha games or whatever...

1114
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,020
You know, the characters are gonna have their own...

1115
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,160
You know...

1116
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,140
Pre-assigned seiyuu.

1117
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,060
But with this, like Touhou is in...

1118
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,180
It's own kind of middle grade ground.

1119
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,020
So it's fun.

1120
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,920
This is recorded live.

1121
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:12,660
Yeah.

1122
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:14,980
Okay.

1123
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:15,120
Okay.

1124
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:21,690
I guess we'll go for Rainbow Blue first, right?

1125
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,690
Let's go for Rainbow Blue.

1126
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,210
Okay.

1127
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,460
Let's use my cubes.

1128
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,360
I have many of them.

1129
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,020
I think first pull.

1130
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,040
I think first try.

1131
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,460
First try, baby.

1132
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,000
First try!

1133
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,760
I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

1134
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,940
There's our friend!

1135
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:27,350
It's just a bunch of flowers.

1136
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,110
Okay, this is for Yuka.

1137
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,030
No!

1138
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:40,050
Everybody, don't forget to donate to your local shrine maiden, okay?

1139
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,850
Don't forget to donate to your local shrine maiden.

1140
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,330
No!

1141
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:51,350
The

1142
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,480
art in this game is so cute.

1143
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,820
Oh my gosh.

1144
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,220
This is sad.

1145
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,140
This is very New Year's, huh?

1146
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,200
Okay, this seems very New Year's.

1147
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,000
Makes me want some oranges.

1148
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,560
Nice rock.

1149
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,940
That's a rock fact.

1150
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,380
Okay, got the sunflowers again.

1151
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,340
Oh gosh, what's her name again?

1152
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:36,360
Yes,

1153
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:44,820
thank you.

1154
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,280
I wanted to cosplay her too.

1155
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,520
She's so cute.

1156
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:50,920
Ah!

1157
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,310
But this is not...

1158
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,390
This is not Blue-Eyed Moon.

1159
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,330
This is not Blue-Eyed Moon.

1160
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,930
Wrong blue.

1161
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,650
One more!

1162
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:20,970
Okay.

1163
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,690
The sun is friend guaranteed.

1164
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,170
So we know we're gonna get a friend.

1165
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,280
But...

1166
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,780
There she is.

1167
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,160
That's Raymoon.

1168
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,800
I can feel it.

1169
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,740
In my ectoplasm.

1170
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,020
I can feel it in my ectoplasm!

1171
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Oh my gosh.

1172
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,440
This art is so cute!

1173
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,120
That's so cute.

1174
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,140
Bug.

1175
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,600
Bug.

1176
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,620
Oh my god, this art is the cutest!

1177
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,620
Yeah, a certain night bug perhaps.

1178
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,840
A certain wriggly night bug.

1179
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,780
Ojo-sama!

1180
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,160
Ruin cleaning stuff, Ojo-sama!

1181
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,360
Oh my god, so cute.

1182
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,860
Wait, who's the artist for this?

1183
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,660
I love all the different uses of artists too, you know?

1184
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,120
The name.

1185
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,560
Sorry.

1186
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,600
I'm professional.

1187
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,940
I'm professional today.

1188
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,340
I'm seiso.

1189
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,420
I'm seiso.

1190
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,420
I'm seiso, I'm seiso.

1191
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,400
Miracle night.

1192
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,080
Certain Onis drink from that.

1193
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,950
Usually I'd be like...

1194
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,190
This was faded.

1195
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:27,350
Did you see how many...

1196
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,310
Did you see how many Remilia cards we pulled?

1197
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,410
This was like faded.

1198
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,410
Maybe we have to...

1199
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,930
Hold on.

1200
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,010
Maybe I have to switch.

1201
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,290
Let's switch to my cover.

1202
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,210
I mean, this cover is great and all.

1203
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,110
Whoever sang it sounds great.

1204
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:49,910
But...

1205
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,250
But let's switch to my cover.

1206
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:59,050
That just premiered.

1207
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:01,330
What?

1208
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,610
Wait, how do I go to it again?

1209
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:08,270
Is it through here?

1210
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:09,990
I forgot again.

1211
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:10,750
Sorry guys.

1212
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,970
I'm such a bad streamer.

1213
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:15,910
Where was it again?

1214
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:16,770
Oh my gosh, hold on.

1215
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:18,430
Ah!

1216
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:19,810
There is a Discord too!

1217
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:20,750
You can see it.

1218
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,950
There's a Discord if you're interested.

1219
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,050
Because the devs are pretty...

1220
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,130
They're...

1221
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,750
They're pretty active.

1222
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,270
Like talking and everything.

1223
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,110
And they'll be like...

1224
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,390
Face icon.

1225
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1226
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:40,910
Awesome.

1227
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:52,090
My cover.

1228
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:56,910
Let's see though.

1229
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,570
You know what?

1230
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:59,430
Let's get these two.

1231
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,510
Because they're the best.

1232
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,660
Wait, no, no, no.

1233
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,300
Switch though, switch.

1234
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,040
Switch, switch, switch, switch.

1235
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,620
Hold on, let's go to...

1236
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:12,140
Go page.

1237
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,500
Go back.

1238
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,260
Wait, go page?

1239
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,460
Go page!

1240
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,320
Go back.

1241
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,000
No!

1242
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:23,560
Go page!

1243
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,080
Go back.

1244
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,460
There we go.

1245
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:26,840
Okay, okay.

1246
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,540
Okay, now we'll have good luck.

1247
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,540
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1248
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,180
That's really weird.

1249
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,500
Oh my god, that's me.

1250
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,720
That's me saying a lot.

1251
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,320
Amelia refusing to leave.

1252
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,300
Yeah, but...

1253
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,200
I don't want her to go.

1254
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,260
Did you guys have a good New Year's?

1255
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,960
I swear that's me singing.

1256
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,060
Even though I sound like this right now.

1257
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,260
That's me singing, I promise.

1258
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,600
Oh, sweet dreams.

1259
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,420
See, I told you!

1260
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,500
Good luck!

1261
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,820
Good luck if you put on my song!

1262
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:47,220
Why does it hurt?

1263
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,080
Is this...

1264
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,700
Lily White?

1265
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,280
One of the fairies.

1266
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,780
This art is so cute.

1267
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,440
It's so cute.

1268
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,120
Oh my gosh.

1269
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:08,520
It's spring!

1270
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,080
Even when it's not spring.

1271
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,160
It's spring!

1272
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,780
According to Lily.

1273
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,640
It's a really guard card?

1274
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:19,400
Oh, really?

1275
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,460
Let's go.

1276
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,510
Emerging power.

1277
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:30,630
You guys like?

1278
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:31,950
We're at the Hakurei Shrine.

1279
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,690
Oh, we got this card again.

1280
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:34,030
Okay.

1281
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:35,170
Bloom!

1282
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:42,270
Show.

1283
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:43,890
Toramaru.

1284
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:51,030
Yeah, we're not going to press the skip button because we like the anticipation.

1285
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,830
That was the Moriya Shrine.

1286
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,150
No!

1287
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:56,510
I mean here!

1288
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,010
Here!

1289
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,310
We're at the Hakurei Shrine!

1290
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:01,930
What are you talking about?

1291
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:04,210
My background.

1292
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,080
Oh, Sanae!

1293
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,260
Oh my gosh.

1294
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,160
Look how cute she is.

1295
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:21,700
Oh my gosh.

1296
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:24,600
I need to know the artist for all of these.

1297
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,380
For...

1298
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,580
For small reasons.

1299
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,880
Oh my god!

1300
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,180
Whoa, the thigh.

1301
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,500
You guys see that squish?

1302
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,980
PENTA PAIN!

1303
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,160
Bimbo...

1304
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,880
Bimbo Miko.

1305
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,160
Hayate is fun.

1306
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,240
She's so cute.

1307
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,230
How is this...

1308
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,430
How is this happening?

1309
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,290
This is just fate!

1310
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:06,830
Oh my god!

1311
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,950
With the Remilia theme, we got Remilia.

1312
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:13,350
And then with the Kaisen theme, we got Kaisen!

1313
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:14,170
How?

1314
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:27,670
PENTA PAIN!

1315
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:30,430
No, this is Touhou!

1316
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:32,370
Sorry.

1317
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:32,890
I'm sorry.

1318
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,070
I'm sorry.

1319
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,170
Touhou lost word.

1320
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,410
Keep going.

1321
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,330
We'll get Bloomer.

1322
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:47,570
PENTA PAIN!

1323
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,510
Maybe the PENTA PAIN is not getting the character you want.

1324
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,510
Truly.

1325
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,370
And we know it's gonna...

1326
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:04,770
Oh, sorry.

1327
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,160
Two?

1328
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,580
Two friends?

1329
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,100
Why are we still here?

1330
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:17,840
Just...

1331
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,340
Three friends!

1332
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,620
It's a triple baby!

1333
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,880
Wait, who are the other two then?

1334
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:48,880
Bloomer!

1335
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,840
Oh my gosh, I love the little Suika.

1336
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,020
The little baby Suika next to her is so cute.

1337
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:56,880
Can you see her here?

1338
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,020
Oops, I didn't mean to tap out of it.

1339
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,860
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

1340
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,140
We were just talking about you, Rego.

1341
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,120
Who's this?

1342
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,440
Flan!

1343
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,380
Go away, Twitter!

1344
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,140
Flan-chan.

1345
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,240
Okay, we got one more to go through though.

1346
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,360
Okay, hold on, we'll just...

1347
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,020
Skip through the cards that we've seen before.

1348
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:39,920
Oh my gosh, clown pieces.

1349
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,120
Using all her 2025 luck right now.

1350
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,380
Don't say that!

1351
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,100
Tiger and dragon.

1352
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,420
So cool.

1353
01:28:58,980 --> 01:28:59,400
Here we go!

1354
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,400
Oh, Aki!

1355
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:06,810
Aki.

1356
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,210
Twitter, go ahead.

1357
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:11,770
Literally, yeah, you were so right.

1358
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:16,450
Cute.

1359
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:17,610
Very cute.

1360
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:22,430
Oh,

1361
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:27,290
she's crying.

1362
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:28,090
Why is she crying?

1363
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,670
Stop!

1364
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:33,730
There we go.

1365
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:34,410
Hold on.

1366
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,010
So this is how you...

1367
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,010
This is how you train them.

1368
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:41,830
You use all your...

1369
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:42,370
I don't...

1370
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,490
I don't have anything.

1371
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,670
But...

1372
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,810
You use your items to make them stronger.

1373
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,610
Or when you use them in battle.

1374
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:49,410
In game.

1375
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:52,710
And then, of course, you know.

1377
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,810
Limit break and everything.

1378
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:54,870
All the...

1379
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:55,790
All the stuff...

1380
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:56,490
All the stuff...

1381
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,010
For, you know...

1382
01:29:59,010 --> 01:29:59,450
Gaming.

1383
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,110
All the gaming gamings.

1384
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:04,930
Oh, oh wait.

1385
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:05,610
Oh, here we go.

1386
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,490
Sorry, I feel like my throat is getting worse.

1387
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:09,930
Ahem.

1388
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,590
Hello Sumida.

1389
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:27,410
Thank you.

1390
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,050
Sorry.

1391
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,890
It doesn't hurt if you're wondering.

1392
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:31,010
It's just...

1393
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,270
It just sounds like it hurts.

1394
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:34,550
It just sounds bad.

1395
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,250
What?

1396
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:48,110
What is your headcanon rainbow sound?

1397
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,550
Tired.

1398
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:00,090
Haha.

1399
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,390
I think this one so far.

1400
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,390
No, I think this one.

1401
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:24,190
I think I like this one.

1402
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,150
Two and three are close.

1403
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:29,510
Yeah.

1404
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,150
It has a bit more...

1405
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:38,710
Of a mature tone.

1406
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:43,590
Got her in 40 pulls.

1407
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:44,830
Let's go!

1408
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:46,010
Yeah!

1409
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:49,690
Nice.

1410
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,510
Yeah, I think three.

1411
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:55,270
Yeah, it feels very...

1412
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:58,290
Yeah, a little tomboyish.

1413
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,210
That's how I feel for her too, right?

1414
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:01,430
A little tomboyish.

1415
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:07,450
Like...

1416
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:09,710
Alright.

1417
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,290
So we got...

1418
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,790
We got Bloom.

1419
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,590
Now we gotta get Redisa.

1420
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:19,470
Now we gotta get Redisa!

1421
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,290
Let's see.

1422
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,910
But look at all these other...

1423
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,730
I should also, of course, highlight the other...

1424
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:30,310
Gacha that are happening.

1425
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:34,730
And when I say the other gacha that are happening...

1426
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:35,330
You guys.

1427
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:37,290
You guys!

1428
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,810
Getting a little yukkuri still.

1429
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,910
There is an insane amount...

1430
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:48,590
Of things.

1431
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,390
I love this.

1432
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,290
It's spring!

1433
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:51,370
Even when it's not!

1434
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,510
You got this.

1435
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,150
Zanmu Limited.

1436
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:03,030
And then...

1437
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:04,690
A love all color Letty...

1438
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:05,310
Letty.

1439
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,770
Letty White Rock.

1440
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:08,710
I don't know why I could not say her name.

1441
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:09,470
Letty.

1442
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:12,610
You got all these.

1443
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:13,870
You got Goth Yomu!

1444
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:15,290
In there.

1445
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,630
So cute, so cute.

1446
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,510
Class collection.

1447
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:22,910
Oh my god, Yomu in the little...

1448
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,870
In the little poncho is too cute.

1449
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:26,870
I can't.

1450
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:28,350
Look at all these.

1451
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:29,590
Look at all these different outfits.

1452
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,450
They are so fun.

1453
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,780
Oh my god.

1454
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,600
All color Flan kills me.

1455
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,380
Look how cute she is.

1456
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:43,280
I mean, she just looks like Remilia.

1457
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,140
But look how cool Raisen is.

1458
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,600
Yeah, there is so much here.

1459
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,020
And of course...

1460
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,920
Of course, because of Phantom Pain...

1461
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,020
You can pull for...

1462
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:54,540
Kassan!

1463
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:54,920
Kassan!

1464
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:56,840
Actually...

1465
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,600
Maybe instead of...

1466
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,540
Maybe instead of...

1467
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:04,460
Redessa, we pull for Kassan.

1468
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,320
Let's play...

1469
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,200
Let's try for Kassan.

1470
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:16,540
We'll see how lucky we get.

1471
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,920
We got her already, but I want her more.

1472
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,480
Oh yeah, wait.

1473
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:22,840
You're right.

1474
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,800
I did pull Kassan.

1475
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,640
You're right.

1476
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,300
I didn't just get her on the banner.

1477
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,480
But it feels more special when you get her on the banner, right?

1478
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,900
Oh, we got the Hakurei shrine.

1479
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,220
This is bigger Kassan.

1480
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,360
Oh my gosh, this looks so amazing.

1481
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,050
Sorry, I appreciate art.

1482
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,170
Oh my gosh, so cute.

1483
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:05,430
Cute!

1484
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,660
How many artists...

1485
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:21,140
How many artists have worked in Lost World, I wonder?

1486
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:28,220
I'm the strongest of the artists.

1487
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,860
We have the other fairy.

1488
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:37,380
Well, the other fairy of many.

1489
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,260
Nameless greater fairy is so sad.

1490
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,900
Let's try again.

1491
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:04,800
More Kassan.

1492
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,820
The other fairy is just disrespectful.

1493
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:20,840
I apologize.

1494
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,880
She's the nameless greater fairy.

1495
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,300
It's kind of scary though.

1496
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,240
It's cute, but kind of scary.

1497
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,280
I love the Sakuya art.

1498
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,520
Nico spotted.

1499
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,760
I don't think I ever beat Ten Desires.

1500
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,980
Now that I think about it.

1501
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,040
I don't think I ever did.

1502
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,310
Ten Desire let's play.

1503
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,190
Maybe I should.

1504
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,650
What was the gimmick in that game?

1505
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:21,930
If you beat UFO, you get bragging rights.

1506
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,110
Anyway, that game is tough.

1507
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:26,610
You

1508
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,800
can call me a gamer.

1509
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,260
Back then, I could beat it.

1510
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:37,560
Nowadays...

1511
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,020
Nowadays, I don't think I could.

1512
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,340
This art is so cute.

1513
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:53,110
You can try.

1514
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,560
I still think...

1515
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:58,690
Subterranean animism is very difficult.

1516
01:37:59,170 --> 01:37:59,790
Oh, Kaguya!

1517
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:05,180
First we get...

1518
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:06,850
First we get...

1519
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,450
Eirin.

1520
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,650
And now we get Kaguya.

1521
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:15,010
Everything...

1522
01:38:15,010 --> 01:38:16,110
Everything I am.

1523
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,510
Eirin and Kaguya.

1524
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:25,230
Eirin and Kaguya.

1525
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:25,530
Alright.

1526
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,090
Cussing or bust.

1527
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:29,450
Wait.

1528
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,090
I know the issue.

1529
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:32,610
I know the issue.

1530
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:34,110
It's because...

1531
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:36,450
What's taking so long to load?

1532
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:38,750
Why did it take so long?

1533
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:40,870
Next is Mokou, right?

1534
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,930
Right?

1535
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:45,370
Wait.

1536
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:47,810
We have to change it to my cover song.

1537
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,370
Pass the wrong BGM.

1538
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,070
Exactly.

1539
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,690
That's why it took so long to load!

1540
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:11,590
Also, this art is so cute.

1541
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:14,850
I can't remember...

1542
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,150
The little one's name.

1543
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:18,730
The little character.

1544
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:19,570
What's her name?

1545
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:20,830
She has the big...

1546
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,490
The big...

1547
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:22,010
What's it called?

1548
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,010
Needle.

1549
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:27,130
What's her name?

1550
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:29,550
Sukuna!

1551
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,430
Shin Myomaru.

1552
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:36,190
Thank you.

1553
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:38,430
So many characters to remember.

1554
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:41,510
So many to remember.

1555
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:46,770
First...

1556
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:52,190
Sorry, I keep muting the cough.

1557
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:54,710
Usami!

1558
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:58,050
Sumireko Usami.

1559
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:01,190
Nashi nashi!

1560
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:03,110
Sake!

1561
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,980
Prism River.

1562
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,000
Prism...

1563
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,880
Prism River!

1564
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,680
Wait, imagine if it was the other two.

1565
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,240
For the other two people.

1566
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,800
The two friends people.

1567
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:18,580
That'd be crazy.

1568
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,460
Imagine if we pulled all the Prism Rivers.

1569
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,040
What kind of luck would that be?

1570
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,200
That would be the most insane thing ever.

1571
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,360
That makes me want some inari sushi.

1572
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,460
Half phantom!

1573
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,700
I'm full phantom, but...

1574
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,080
Some people have compared me to Yomu in the past.

1575
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,720
Mist!

1576
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:05,410
Look how cute she is.

1577
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:08,930
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1578
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,470
You're both green and ghosts.

1579
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,350
I'm too deep into the Toho rabbit hole.

1580
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:19,630
I remember everyone's names in the greatest detail.

1581
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:20,690
That's awesome.

1582
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:22,950
Stay in the Toho hole.

1583
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,920
I love this artist, Ixi!

1584
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,880
I love Ixi.

1585
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:35,340
Oh my god.

1586
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,960
This Ixi is so happy!

1587
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,000
Oh my god.

1588
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,820
I love Ixi art.

1589
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,320
And Tan Cherno.

1590
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:46,860
The biggest bonus.

1591
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,760
This is an absolute win for me.

1592
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,140
And our final friend.

1593
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,800
I

1594
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:05,150
did it!

1595
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,690
She sounds so cool.

1596
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:19,450
Success again!

1597
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:23,230
Kai said, don't be, don't jump.

1598
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:33,830
Amazing.

1599
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:35,650
Amazing!

1600
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:36,770
Wow.

1601
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:39,370
Look at this pole.

1602
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:41,390
This is insane.

1603
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:44,950
BGM is not wrong after all.

1604
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:45,790
I know, right?

1605
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,330
But I want to listen to my cover.

1606
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:57,270
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1607
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:00,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1608
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:02,950
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1609
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:07,470
It's this one, right?

1610
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:12,510
Switch.

1611
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,680
That's why you're called Phantom.

1612
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,580
I'm a ghost.

1613
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:38,080
I'm a ghost.

1614
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,100
I'm a ghost maid.

1615
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,700
Did I introduce myself at the beginning of the stream?

1616
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,320
I did?

1617
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,000
Sorry.

1618
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,740
You can do it again now.

1619
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,840
Welcome back.

1620
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:08,780
Master.

1621
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:09,540
Master.

1622
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:10,460
Welcome.

1623
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:11,860
I'm Miss Phantom.

1624
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,660
I'm a ghost maid Vtuber.

1625
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,040
I really love Touhou.

1626
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:23,480
And I like Touhou music so much.

1627
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,100
Welcome back.

1628
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:29,620
I'm back.

1629
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,240
Welcome back.

1630
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,700
It's actually me singing, I promise.

1631
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,900
You kind of said, oh by the way, I'm Mint before.

1632
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,780
I didn't really do a proper introduction.

1633
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:53,240
I did talk about how I got into Touhou and stuff though.

1634
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,120
And all the fun stuff.

1635
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:07,720
There's honestly just so much that Lost Word has to offer.

1636
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,400
If I were to get into all of it...

1637
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,040
I'm already almost at the 2 hour mark.

1638
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,900
You didn't say why you did sing Phantom Pain.

1639
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,840
Yeah, no, I did say that though.

1640
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:25,940
I did, I did, I did.

1641
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,460
I did, I did, I did say that.

1642
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,300
Yeah, I haven't even touched any of the actual game.

1643
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,460
I haven't even touched any of the actual game.

1644
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,640
I think I'm at my limit with my voice.

1645
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:50,880
We were able to get Bloom and Kassen.

1646
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:54,920
So I pray for everybody for your gacha luck.

1647
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:59,760
If you are pulling for Kassen or Blue Rainbow or Red Marisa.

1648
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:08,120
I got a notification for Touhou Lost Word.

1649
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:16,840
I hope you enjoy your time in Gensokyo.

1650
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,580
And be sure to check out, obviously the game, but also the Touhou Lost Word channel.

1651
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:31,700
Because they have lots of other amazing songs and arrangements.

1652
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,500
And I recommend them.

1653
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,660
And then you can have them in the game.

1654
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:42,160
I love this song so much, I can't get over it.

1655
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,680
Kassen is just yapping.

1656
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,900
She just doesn't shut up.

1657
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,740
Congrats on the cover collab!

1658
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,660
Thank you!

1659
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,360
Thank you so much!

1660
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:01,060
Yeah, there is a link below in the description.

1661
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,560
You can also just get it from the game store as well.

1662
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:10,720
The link just takes you to the website in the description.

1663
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,480
But it shows you a little bit more about everything.

1664
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,240
Look how cute that pink flan is.

1665
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:22,200
The urge to pull.

1666
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,320
The urge to pull for her.

1667
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:28,660
Thanks for the sponsorship stream.

1668
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,180
Thank you guys!

1669
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,980
Log in, yeah, do your dailies.

1670
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:39,980
Pull, pull, pull.

1671
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,860
I wish you the best of luck in the new year with all your gacha.

1672
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,680
And all of your gaming efforts.

1673
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,500
Thank you so much again to Next Ninja.

1674
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,280
For having me do the stream and having me do the cover song.

1675
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,700
I'm really, really, really honored about it.

1676
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:07,860
I think that's about it.

1677
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,020
No.

1678
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:14,600
Akidoki!

1679
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,220
Atsumi-tan!

1680
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,860
Go listen to the cover song!

1681
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,200
Go, go, go, listen, listen, listen!

1682
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:22,420
I'll see you guys later!

1683
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,260
Sorry, my voice is so bad.

1684
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,040
Oh wait, I forgot to do this too.

1685
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:33,540
Kind of matches the vibes of this poem.

1686
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:34,620
Maybe a little bit.

1687
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,180
Bye!

1688
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:46,890
Thank you!

1689
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:48,270
Bye bye!

1690
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:49,530
Atsumi-tan!

1691
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:51,150
See you later!

1692
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,750
Bye bye!
