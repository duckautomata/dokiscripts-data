1
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,460
Sorry, we were waiting a minute.

2
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,900
She had to put on a spaceship.

3
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,740
Oh yeah, it was all me.

4
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,440
All me.

5
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Yeah, it was all me.

6
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,380
I have my space suit on.

7
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,390
Yeah, while we were waiting, Nimi sent us a very...

8
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,640
Hey, it was from the steam pane.

9
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,560
Right off the steam pane.

10
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,560
Oh, I see what's happening in that picture.

11
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,440
I just was focused on the sentence.

12
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,320
I didn't even see it.

13
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,780
Oh.

14
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
Oh, Nimi was like, I didn't... Oh.

15
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,600
I see, I see.

16
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,560
It's that type of game.

17
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah, it's that kind of game.

18
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,400
Yeah, you just gotta help a brother out, you know.

19
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,660
We'll see if that happens to any of us.

20
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah.

21
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,180
What a way to go, you know.

22
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,300
What a way to die.

23
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,520
This is some people's real fantasy, though.

24
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,720
Yeah, honestly it is.

25
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,220
It's the first thing that goes.

26
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,540
Wait, where did you find this?

27
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
On the Steam page?

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,660
Yeah, it's on... No, it's on the...

29
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,800
It's on the official Steam page for the game.

30
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,700
Oh, yeah, but you guys know where it is.

31
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,120
I'll show.

32
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,020
Yeah, I'll show.

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,640
Some people thought it was amazing.

34
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,020
I'll show it too.

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll put it on the screen for the...

36
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,100
This is for the class.

37
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,260
Here you go, everybody.

38
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,020
Why don't you share the class?

39
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,040
Share it in the class.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Nimi, why don't you...

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm sharing it.

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,640
I...

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,880
I take no responsibility for this image.

44
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,540
This was...

45
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,280
This was...

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
Posted for everyone to see on the...

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,140
On the Steam page.

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,820
It was out in the public.

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,200
This is why Doki chose this game.

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,220
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,120
I saw this...

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,200
I saw that...

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,300
That specific image.

54
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,260
I was like...

55
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,500
Damn.

56
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,280
The perfect game.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
I wonder why he died.

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Yeah.

59
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,940
Weak.

60
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,880
That's all I'll say.

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,840
Weak?

62
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,540
Anyway.

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,660
Hello, everybody.

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
Welcome to...

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
To the green-yellow collab.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,760
Yay!

67
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,180
Team green!

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go green!

69
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,940
Let's go green!

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's go yellow!

71
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,300
Yellow!

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,640
Yellow!

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,180
We all have a little bit of green on us.

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Yeah, and we all have a little bit of yellow on us, too.

75
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,900
Wait, that's true!

76
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,520
Yeah.

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,600
Cohesion.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
We're really actually cohesive.

79
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,380
Oh, yeah, we do.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,880
The green-yellow woman.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,200
The lobby clothes.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Oh, did it?

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,240
We're all still here.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,260
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,740
Come back!

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,860
Okay, gosh.

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,560
I was like...

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
Hey, come back to us, Doobie!

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,500
Come back!

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,800
Come back to space!

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,420
Hold on.

92
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,860
She landed back on Earth.

93
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,580
She had...

94
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,540
I got ejected.

95
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,380
I got voted out.

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,900
Oh, yeah.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,800
You got voted out.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Gotta do your tasks.

99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,980
Yeah, someone was not doing their tasks.

100
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,640
Why didn't you fix the lights when it was off, Doobie?

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,160
Hi!

102
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,940
I'm busy looking at an image, really.

103
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,460
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
He looks good.

105
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,540
That's the one.

106
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,740
You got distracted.

107
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,580
I think that makes Nimi the most size.

108
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,600
Oh, that's true!

109
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,780
Don't vote me out!

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,600
I don't know what I'm doing!

111
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
I've never played the game before!

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,980
I like this story!

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,080
Excuses!

114
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,220
Excuses!

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,580
Yeah, none of us have played the game before!

116
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,880
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,420
Yeah, actually...

118
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,900
Do we know what kind of game this is?

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,560
Um...

120
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
It's basically...

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Actually, no.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,640
I mean, it's like one of those proximity chat horror co-op games, right?

123
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,760
You know what's funny?

124
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,380
I suggested the game, too.

125
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,960
I was like, um...

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,320
No.

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,860
I just know we're exploring the moon.

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,100
It's like...

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,780
We're trying...

130
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,040
Oh, wait, no.

131
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,620
We're trying to find the moon.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,280
And return alive.

133
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,500
So it's like a friend swap.

134
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,120
Trying to find the moon?

135
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,280
Yeah.

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,100
We lost the moon?

137
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,380
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,600
It did say something like that.

139
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,740
You have to find the moon.

140
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,880
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,280
I don't know.

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,400
How could...

143
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,880
Oh, my gosh.

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,660
Gru did it.

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,960
He fucking did it.

146
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,160
He stole...

147
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,080
He stole the moon.

148
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
And we're trying to find it back.

149
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,600
We're just little minions.

150
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,620
My steam is offline.

151
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,320
I gotta fix it.

152
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh, no.

153
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,240
Take your time.

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,380
Wait.

155
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:14,720
Oh, no.

156
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,080
Take your time.

157
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,620
But it's not Tuesday.

158
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:17,980
Oh.

159
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,320
Is it Tuesday?

160
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm really...

161
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,240
No, no.

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,820
It's Friday.

163
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,560
It's definitely Friday.

164
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,600
Yeah.

165
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,920
Happy Friday.

166
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,600
Yay.

167
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,740
Happy Friday, everybody.

168
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,740
Happy Friday, everyone.

169
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
Happy Friday.

170
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay.

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,280
Also, Soundgat.

172
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,660
My...

173
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,180
For people who are, like, wondering about the sound.

174
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,520
We're gonna be using the in-game VC.

175
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,520
But, like, the lobby VC is so quiet.

176
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:38,840
Yeah.

177
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,060
We gotta, like, get in-game and kind of fix it.

178
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,840
Yeah.

179
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,380
Yeah.

180
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
But we sound like we're in space, though.

181
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,100
That's the best part.

182
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,520
We sound like we're actually in our little spacesuits.

183
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,520
That's, like, Xbox mic.

184
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,040
It really is.

185
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,980
It is.

186
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm gonna get on there.

187
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm gonna be, like, a ten-year-old.

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,680
I'm gonna cuss you out.

189
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,780
No.

190
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,480
No.

191
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,020
John Madden.

192
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,600
John Madden.

193
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,380
John Madden.

194
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,420
You frickin' dummy.

195
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,240
All right.

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,060
You're gonna get banned for that kind of language.

197
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,160
Oh, that's true.

198
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,500
I will hurt you.

199
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,900
Gabe is looking right now.

200
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,980
Oh, no.

201
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,660
John Madden.

202
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,600
She's...

203
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,760
Sucking.

204
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,880
That video, apparently, is, like, 15-plus years old.

205
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,340
And it's still fun.

206
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,780
Still got it.

207
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,440
Every, like, couple of months, I think about it.

208
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Oh, no.

209
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,320
All right.

210
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,520
Doob... Oh, wait.

211
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,160
Is Steam still down for you, Doobie?

212
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,600
Um...

213
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,200
It was up.

214
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,420
Like, I closed it and then I relaunched it and then I connected.

215
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,840
But now I'm disconnected again.

216
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh, no.

217
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,480
That's not good.

218
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Oh, it was working.

219
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,340
Sorry.

220
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,940
It's okay.

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,440
It's okay.

222
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,240
It's all right.

223
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,880
We're bonding.

224
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,500
Yeah.

225
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,420
We're having a little bonding session before we betray each other in space.

226
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,160
Oh, is it that the game?

227
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,680
There's no rules in space, Batman.

228
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,860
Oh, man.

229
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,300
Is PvP enabled?

230
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,420
Is PvP a thing?

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,920
I was like, is it even a thing?

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,100
I don't know.

233
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,720
I mean, can we fight the monsters or no?

234
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,440
I mean...

235
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
I hope so.

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
We can with our mouth.

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,500
With words.

238
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,240
Oh, no.

239
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
I mean, with words.

240
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,280
Where are you bullying?

241
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,480
With words.

242
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:27,980
With words.

243
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,260
Oh, okay.

244
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,120
With words.

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
That's what she means.

246
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,920
We'll just...

247
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,980
We'll say very mean words to them.

248
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,300
Yeah.

249
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,360
And they'll go away.

250
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,320
Sticks and stones.

251
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,880
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,080
Isn't it probably like the opposite?

253
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,160
Like, it'll sense when you talk or something and then it'll find you.

254
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,660
Oh, probably.

255
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,020
Just say, won't they find us?

256
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,600
Apparently, this game is made by one person.

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh.

258
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,840
We can attribute everything to them.

259
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
Yeah, that's true.

260
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,940
She made it!

261
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm in!

262
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,020
Oh my god!

263
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,420
Alright, I'll start the...

264
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,340
I'll start the lobby.

265
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay, wait.

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Should we mute everybody?

267
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,560
Oh, wait.

268
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh, I forgot.

269
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,460
She didn't choose her color.

270
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,680
Alright, she's white now.

271
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Okay.

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm white!

273
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Yay!

274
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,860
Okay, I'm gonna...

275
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,520
Wait, we turn everybody to zero, right?

276
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,980
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
We turn everyone to zero in Discord.

278
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Okay, bye-bye.

279
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,300
Bye-bye.

280
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,320
Bye-bye.

281
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,460
Bye-bye.

282
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,800
Hello?

283
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Hello?

284
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,660
Alright, I'm gonna turn...

285
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm gonna fix the audio.

286
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,980
Hello?

287
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,180
Oh, gosh.

288
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,460
Hello!

289
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,760
It's so...

290
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,280
low.

291
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,760
I'm gonna turn my mic up.

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,820
Pretty quiet.

293
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,920
This is...

294
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,160
Okay, my mic up is up.

295
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Is it up for you guys?

296
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,860
Uh, a little bit.

297
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,920
It's a little better.

298
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,720
Could be better.

299
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,860
Alright.

300
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,320
It's at 250.

301
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,360
250?

302
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,800
Okay, I'll put mine at 250.

303
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,140
Oh, that's the max.

304
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah.

305
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,100
Me too.

306
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,440
Hello?

307
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,420
Hello?

308
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,620
Hello?

309
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,760
Hello?

310
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:56,820
Hello?

311
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
No, louder.

312
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,500
250.

313
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,480
Put it at 250.

314
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,600
I said 250.

315
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,420
I put it at 250.

316
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,880
250!

317
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,260
It was...

318
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,800
It did improve for the others, but...

319
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,900
Bruce is still a little quiet.

320
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,360
Wait, Nimmi, can you try talking?

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,600
Hello!

322
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,920
Komakuwa!

323
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,420
I'm gonna turn...

324
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,880
Everybody's so quiet.

325
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,840
Maybe...

326
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,760
Maybe we turn the...

327
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,140
game...

328
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,720
Like, volume.

329
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

330
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm doing that right now.

331
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm turning the volume to max too.

332
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,460
Wait.

333
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,920
There's only...

334
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,060
The monsters are gonna be so...

335
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,080
loud.

336
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm turning the game.

337
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,360
Yeah.

338
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,940
Everything's gonna be really loud.

339
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,600
I turn the...

340
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,140
Oh wait, I'm gonna turn the game- other game stuff lower.

341
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
How do you do that though?

342
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,320
I don't think- Yeah, is there other game stuff?

343
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,020
There's only- Oh, here we go, that should've fixed it.

344
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,580
Oh my god!

345
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,960
Oh!

346
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,040
Gooby, you did it!

347
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,900
How did you fix it?

348
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,040
Oh, oh.

349
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,700
You fixed it!

350
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,800
You fixed it!

351
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,680
Oh my god!

352
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:48,700
It's good?

353
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,440
Are you loud now?

355
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
It's too loud?

356
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,840
No, you're like- What?

357
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,020
Should I turn it down?

358
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,820
No, it's good.

359
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,340
It's good.

360
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
I turned it down a little.

361
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:15,720
It's- it's like peeking, so like, it's like- I hear like- It doesn't peek for us, but your setup is peeking and like, we can only hear like- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh- Can I get your order?

362
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,660
Master volume.

363
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,860
You turn down the master volume, and that's the game.

364
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,180
The game is master.

365
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,580
It's not- also- The game doesn't affect the voices.

366
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,020
Oh, no, it does.

367
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,220
The master volume also affects voices, yeah.

368
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,600
Oh, it does.

369
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,700
Never mind, it does.

370
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,440
I just turn- Yeah, I turn it back up.

371
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,040
Well, w- w- Doobie, how did you fix it on your end?

372
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,160
Fix that?

373
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,660
What did- what did you do?

374
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,360
What?

375
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,720
Oh, I just turned that motion volume.

376
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,680
Does it still sound bad?

377
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,620
I'm so loud!

378
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Aw.

379
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,940
Well, luckily- Luckily, we're all streaming our POVs, so- Yeah, like- Yeah.

380
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, okay.

381
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,340
Someone will combine it, I guess.

382
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Someone will sync up all our audio together.

383
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,460
Quite the work they've done ahead of them.

384
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Sorry, everyone.

385
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,100
The ultimate compilation.

386
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,380
I don't- like, I don't understand.

387
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,040
Why is there no individual toggles?

388
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,160
I don't know!

389
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,860
It's just- Okay.

390
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,680
It really feels like we're in space, guys.

391
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,340
I don't think we're in space, though.

392
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,340
Wait, we can't jump!

393
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,720
This is a parking lot.

394
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:33,940
This is a parking lot.

395
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,180
It feels just like- Why are we in the parking lot?

396
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,740
I can't crouch- Oh, wait.

397
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,940
Oh, I can't crouch.

398
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,820
Okay, it's still- Oh, yes.

399
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,460
He is crouch.

400
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,020
Wait, how do we get- Oh, my God!

401
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,260
Whoa!

402
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,180
Yay!

403
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,760
Whoa!

404
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,240
Whoa!

405
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,120
Whoa!

406
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,260
How do you dance?

407
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,720
Yeah, how do you dance?

408
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,300
It's called G.

409
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,820
G?

410
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, I see.

411
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,300
What's this?

412
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,420
Whoa!

413
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,920
Oh, yeah!

414
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,320
Whoa!

415
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
Whoa!

416
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,880
Whoa!

417
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,400
Wait!

418
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,380
It's Doobie!

419
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,680
Wait!

420
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
It's actual Doobie!

421
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,820
Wait, what's happening to me?

422
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,200
Oh, hello!

423
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,920
Why did I go over there?

424
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,620
We just do- Wow, guys.

425
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,940
I didn't know space was just a parking lot.

426
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,020
I- Yeah.

427
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,200
Oh, you have a creepy van, too.

428
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh, my gosh.

429
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,020
Ew.

430
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
What are we trying to do?

431
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,920
Oh, you can get in!

432
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,260
You saw the image.

433
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,620
You saw- What are we implying here?

434
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,280
Alright, where do we go?

435
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,160
So we have equipment.

436
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,640
I don't know.

437
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,640
We're supposed to turn on electricity on the first floor.

438
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:54,820
Oh, right here.

439
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,840
Yeah, we have an objective.

440
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,420
Oh my god, it's Phasmo.

441
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't say that.

442
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,280
Wait.

443
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,580
Wait, I don't have a flashlight.

444
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:02,740
Wait, I don't have a flashlight.

445
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,880
Oh!

446
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,380
Wait, we sound better in here!

447
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,760
Okay.

448
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,080
Oh, it's echo-y in here.

449
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,760
Oh!

450
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,500
I like it.

451
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,140
The words that can be interacted with or highlighted with a faint light.

452
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,860
That's good to know.

453
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,920
Oh, there's a special book.

454
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,640
Wait, what?

455
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,560
What's this?

456
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,480
I can't read it.

457
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh!

458
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,420
The words that can be interacted with or highlighted with a faint light.

459
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,340
Someone else read this.

460
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,100
Special book number one.

461
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,320
Oh my god, Doobie scared me so bad.

462
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,400
What does it say?

463
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,440
Special book.

464
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,500
Wait, how do you read?

465
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,800
What does it say, Mint?

466
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,160
Hello?

467
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,100
Hello?

468
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,300
Mint?

469
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah?

470
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,020
Mint, are you okay?

471
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,980
Mint?

472
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,700
Wait, can you not hear me?

473
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,000
Stop talking!

474
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Mint, Doobie, you're not talking!

475
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,460
I'm talking!

476
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:54,380
Wait, does it limit us when we enter the building and we're like in our own little like- Hello!

477
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,160
In our dimension.

478
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,640
The pocket dimension where we can only hear- Oh no, the yellow and green.

479
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,420
We can't split.

480
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
The yellow and green.

481
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,900
Wait, I can't hear Doobie though.

482
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
It's like, you know, it's like wife swap.

483
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,580
Wait, hold on.

484
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,500
I think there's a text, no?

485
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,900
Wait, hold on.

486
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,320
Text?

487
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

488
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,740
It's okay, we can do this.

489
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,200
Yeah.

490
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm gonna leave and come back in.

491
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Hello?

492
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,330
Hurry outside!

493
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,310
Wife swap.

494
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,910
Hello?

495
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,370
I'm scary looking.

496
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,590
Oh, the cat!

497
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,390
Whoa!

498
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,630
Oh, he's alive!

499
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:41,630
Oh, he's alive!

500
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,510
Okay, we got five with power.

501
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,490
Oh, he's powering!

502
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,250
Is this a collab?

503
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,430
We can figure out where.

504
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,690
Oh, okay, so doobie, I can hear you all of a sudden.

505
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,170
I should unmute you.

506
00:16:59,410 --> 00:16:59,470
Wait.

507
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,710
I can hear!

508
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,790
I can hear you!

509
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,010
I can hear you, Doobie!

510
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,210
Just here people hear you, dude!

511
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,410
Wait, can he hear you?

512
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,250
Yeah, I can hear you.

513
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,550
I got jump... jump scared my game into hearing again.

514
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,430
Wait, apparently it was... we just clicked V on accident.

515
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,410
Oh!

516
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,810
You went in your own pocket and said...

517
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,110
You muted yourself!

518
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,610
Yeah.

519
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,870
You just muted by accident.

520
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,600
I pressed V!

521
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,600
Why?

522
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,320
Because we were probably trying to find a cool emo or something.

523
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,580
Yeah, I was probably trying to press G and then...

524
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,000
Whoa!

525
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,660
Whoa!

526
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Okay, anyway, there was an alien outside that window.

527
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,300
But we heard it.

528
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,260
I don't believe you.

529
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,320
Yeah, I don't know.

530
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,760
It was really loud, I'm scared.

531
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,520
I got a TV!

532
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,220
Oh, nice!

533
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,440
What's on the TV?

534
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,460
It says, uh, no signal.

535
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,480
You got gimch.

536
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,600
Okay, we got electricity.

537
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,600
Wait, this looks like electricity.

538
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

539
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,140
Okay, turn that on.

540
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,660
Nice, we did the first task.

541
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,580
Wait, the cat is...

542
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh, the cat!

543
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,740
Oh, no, the cat's still sleeping.

544
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,640
I thought he was awake.

545
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,580
I don't think there's a space.

546
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,060
Wait, what's this?

547
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,620
What the...?

548
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,680
What's the transmitter?

549
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,120
Wait.

550
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,660
Why is there a moon in the...

551
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,840
Like...

552
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,200
Like...

553
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
We have to find the moon, right?

554
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Oh, yeah, we have to find the moon, yeah.

555
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
Wait, maybe we're gonna build a rocket.

556
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,820
It says to explore the basement.

557
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,760
Oh, yeah.

558
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

559
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:29,760
Good.

560
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,860
Well, we're on the first floor, so we gotta go downstairs.

561
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,200
It's locked.

562
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,480
It's on the other side.

563
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,420
Oh, down here?

564
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,780
Is the sensitivity weird for anybody else?

565
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,540
It's a dead end.

566
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, um, just do the controls.

567
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,380
It's on controls.

568
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,220
Is it?

569
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,040
Yeah, I turned mine down.

570
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,460
Yeah, I turned mine down, yeah.

571
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,140
Okay, I'm gonna turn mine down.

572
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Ah, it's sensitive.

573
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,520
It's already at one.

574
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,120
My chat's like...

575
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,260
Um, actually, Earth is also in space.

576
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,780
Maybe like that.

577
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh, that's better.

578
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,700
True.

579
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,680
True.

580
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,860
What's this?

581
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,460
Brain chat.

582
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,600
I'll go live.

583
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,380
We're just LARPing.

584
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,900
Clothes on the other side.

585
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,060
Oh, there's more over here.

586
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:06,980
Oh.

587
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,800
We kind of are.

588
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,680
Like, we put on our spacesuits already.

589
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,240
We're not even...

590
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah, we're like these kids that are like...

591
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,400
Failed the save game.

592
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,140
Oh, we're here?

593
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,520
We're here?

594
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh, yes.

595
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,620
The theme has been saved.

596
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,300
Oh, okay.

597
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,080
Map data.

598
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,460
Oh, this has to be the basement.

599
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,140
It doesn't have to be.

600
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh, look at that.

601
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,630
Oh, we can change your color.

602
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,150
Doobie, you don't have to be white anymore.

603
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,410
Oh.

604
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,650
Oh, nice.

605
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,750
Okay, I'll be blue.

606
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,670
Blue.

607
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,370
Blue.

608
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,630
Yeah.

609
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,630
What's happening?

610
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,490
It's a different blue than mince blue, right?

611
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,950
I can't tell.

612
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:40,830
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,710
Oh, that's cute.

615
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,190
What's this?

616
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,890
What is all this?

617
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,570
Oh, we have...

618
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,830
Oh, get previously researched items.

619
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,110
Oh, wait.

620
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,410
Is this the book that we...

621
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:51,630
Wait.

622
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:51,990
Oh?

623
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,470
Current objective is displayed in the corner.

624
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,170
Yeah, we know.

625
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,850
Okay.

626
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,830
What's on the other side?

627
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,910
How do we get out of here?

628
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,330
Why is space so lame?

629
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,510
The last time I was alone, something happened.

630
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,110
I like how...

631
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,290
Like, it's like...

632
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,910
We're in like a little suburban area.

633
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,110
Yeah.

634
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,550
We're gonna swear to school or something, right?

635
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,510
Isn't there something scary out there, though?

636
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,370
Do you see that?

637
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,070
What?

638
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:20,550
See what?

639
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,950
Find that building over there?

640
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:22,790
What?

641
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,950
I don't see anything.

642
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:24,890
I don't see anything.

643
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:25,690
Something.

644
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,430
Are you sure any...

645
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,390
Do you take your meds, Mimi?

646
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,530
She's right there, I swear.

647
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,130
I see it.

648
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,230
It's right by the building.

649
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,130
What?

650
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,490
Uh...

651
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,990
That's just a regular kid.

652
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:34,950
That's just...

653
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,490
Why?

654
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,030
There's a kid?

655
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,550
That's...

656
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:37,810
No, yeah.

657
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,210
You guys not see that kid over there?

658
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,090
That's not a kid...

659
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,350
Yeah!

660
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,150
There's a regular...

661
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,010
There's a kid out there.

662
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,790
Do you want to see it?

663
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,050
Is that in the corner?

664
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,850
Yeah, he's a kid.

665
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,030
It's like, 12 feet tall.

666
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,170
What?

667
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,790
He took his vitamins.

668
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,690
He took...

669
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,450
He ate his greens.

670
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,050
And grew to 12 feet tall.

671
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,790
That's like Popeye.

672
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,610
When your nurse starts seeing things, I start worrying.

673
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,810
This is the...

674
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,050
No, we didn't go forward.

675
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,850
This feels like a safe room, no?

676
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,310
What's... what's over there, though?

677
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,390
Oh, it's a safe terminal.

678
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,730
Okay, but where is, like, the fucking basement?

679
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,350
Was it where we were before?

680
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,010
Weren't there stairs?

681
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,230
Maybe we're supposed to find...

682
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,510
Oh!

683
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh!

684
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,110
Oh, the one area we didn't go.

685
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,250
Maybe there... oh, there's a lot of stuff in here.

686
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,070
A monitor.

687
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,530
Oh, a shelf for special books!

688
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,750
Oh, the special book!

689
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,750
I'll go get it.

690
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:40,870
Alright.

691
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,870
He needs a monitor, right?

692
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:44,950
Monitor?

693
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,650
Oh, yeah.

694
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,290
And then our special book, which was...

695
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,450
I think it's in here.

696
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,050
I think it's in here.

697
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,410
Oh, there it is.

698
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,030
My special book.

699
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,010
I think it's in here.

700
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,230
It has a special book in everything.

701
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,390
I got the special book.

702
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,930
I don't think there's stamina in this desert.

703
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,250
Oh, so you can hold three items, it seems.

704
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,230
Special book?

705
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,170
Apply item.

706
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:17,830
Okay, nice.

707
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,190
Wait.

708
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,870
If you're confused and don't know what to do, check with the...

709
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,490
Oh, I thought that said check with the cat.

710
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,530
It's

711
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,680
our little safe room.

712
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,060
Oh!

713
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,420
I brought the TV!

714
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,460
Yay!

715
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,860
Oh, guys, we found the basement!

716
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,480
Does it work?

717
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,720
Oh, yay!

718
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:34,900
Does it work?

719
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah, I found the basement.

720
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,800
There were stairs that we forgot.

721
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,460
I think you put the...

722
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,960
Wait, it says installation monitor.

723
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,780
Here?

724
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,640
Wait, monitor.

725
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,820
We put the monitor here?

726
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,760
Monitor.

727
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
The TV's a monitor.

728
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,880
Monitor.

729
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:46,680
Monitor.

730
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,940
It's not.

731
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,100
You're open.

732
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,280
Guys, I don't think it's the TV...

733
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,340
I don't think it's the TV.

734
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,740
I think it's the TV too old.

735
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,280
It's not like a TV monitor.

736
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,120
Yeah.

737
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,360
It's not.

738
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,500
It's like a CRT.

739
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,040
I'm just gonna take a load off right here.

740
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't ask me a monitor anymore.

741
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,360
Alright, we found the...

742
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
Men, get the fuck up.

743
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,780
Okay.

744
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,000
We have...

745
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,760
We gotta find the moon!

746
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,260
We gotta, yeah, we gotta explore the basement.

747
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,560
We gotta find the moon, guys.

748
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,200
Over here.

749
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,920
It's down here.

750
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,460
Okay.

751
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,300
A moon!

752
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,940
Is there any explanation for the giant cat?

753
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,280
It's a moon cat.

754
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,460
I like him though.

755
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,820
It makes me feel comfortable.

756
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,920
He's purring.

757
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,920
Maybe he's like a guard dog, but a cat.

758
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,460
Maybe space is okay.

759
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,540
Yeah.

760
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,800
Space has giant cats.

761
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,420
Oh, this is a very suspicious entrance.

762
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,120
What if we go upstairs?

763
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,880
What's up here?

764
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,900
Um, it says explore the basement.

765
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,600
They're gonna punish you.

766
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,480
No.

767
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,840
They wouldn't.

768
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,200
Clothes on the other side.

769
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,380
I think we have to do the basement before we can unlock the other floors.

770
00:23:59,620 --> 00:23:59,720
Probably.

771
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,860
Yeah, it seems like it.

772
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,760
Can we leave there?

773
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,840
Is that open?

774
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
Can we go out the window?

775
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,120
Oh, we can't jump.

776
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,380
To a flip.

777
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,360
To a flip.

778
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,720
All right, let's go downstairs.

779
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,340
All right.

780
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,220
Do you need a break?

781
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,900
You're a very great dancer.

782
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,140
I've seen you break dance.

783
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
You can take this.

784
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,620
Oh my god, you're so great to me.

785
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,600
Sometimes the, sometimes the, you're just, the sounds sound a little weird.

786
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,140
It cuts off so bad.

787
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,480
You don't care about me.

788
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,160
You don't care.

789
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,340
You don't care.

790
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
I do.

791
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,400
I do.

792
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,480
Of course I care.

793
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,060
I do.

794
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,560
My knight is shining over.

795
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,240
Elevator.

796
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,400
When dying, if there are other surviving players.

797
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,760
Bye bye.

798
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,720
Bye.

799
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,320
We have to go in.

800
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,540
All players must be in.

801
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,580
Oh, wow.

802
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,560
It's really upset.

803
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,260
I don't like elevators.

804
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,420
I know.

805
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm scared.

806
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,280
I get dizzy if you want an elevator.

807
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,740
Basement 2.

808
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,920
There's a basement too?

809
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,500
That's just another basement.

810
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,080
Wait, do you guys have flashlights?

811
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,780
It's...

812
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,520
Yeah.

813
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,180
Oh.

814
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,180
How do you turn it on?

815
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,080
F.

816
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:13,980
F.

817
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,440
F?

818
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,500
F.

819
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,500
F?

820
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:15,660
F?

821
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:15,680
F?

822
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,500
F?

823
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,040
F.

824
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:17,920
F?

825
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,240
F?

826
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,000
Look at that guy.

827
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,540
It was the kid from outside.

828
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,400
This is the 12 feet guy.

829
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,680
The 12 feet guy.

830
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,940
Oh my gosh, she did see a guy.

831
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,400
Oh gosh, we're like colliding so bad.

832
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
Oh, we need a lever.

833
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,480
We need to find a lever.

834
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,400
A lever.

835
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,760
Alright.

836
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,080
I can't see anything.

837
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,440
Someone with a flashlight, go first.

838
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,080
I have a flashlight.

839
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,480
You don't have a flashlight?

840
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:55,940
No.

841
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,000
I swear you're holding one.

842
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
It's a transmitter.

843
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,680
Whatever that is.

844
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,160
Yeah.

845
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,480
Oh, I think because you're holding a transmitter.

846
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,800
I think someone's dead.

847
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,620
Oh!

848
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,580
Wait, someone's dead?

849
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,080
Who's dead?

850
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,720
Oh my god, that was you!

851
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,180
Wait, yeah.

852
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,380
It's Doopie's old body.

853
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:10,640
That was me.

854
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,320
That's my old body.

855
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,860
It's Doopie 1.

856
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,440
You mean I was cloned?

857
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,880
Every time you change color, you're just cloning yourself.

858
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,320
There's a movie like that, but I don't want to say what it is because it's a spoiler for the whole movie.

859
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,160
What is that?

860
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,740
Why is it running towards me?

861
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,780
This is the end.

862
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,480
Oh, okay.

863
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
This is for you, Doopie 1.

864
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,260
Doopie Alpha.

865
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,060
Doopie Alpha.

866
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,140
It's like that, the Mickey, what was it, the one with Robert Pattinson?

867
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,420
Oh, I like that movie, Mickey 17.

868
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Yeah, Mickey 17.

869
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,260
That was, that was Doopie, Doopie 16.

870
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,620
Wait, wait, where did Doopie 17 go?

871
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,980
Um...

872
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,500
Wait, where did Doopie 17 go?

873
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,040
Doopie?

874
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,460
Doopie?

875
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,040
Wait, oh, oh, there's a monster down here!

876
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,980
Wait, there's a monster!

877
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,240
Oh, my godめて, doopie!

878
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,740
Take me, get Doopie!

879
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,160
Take me, get the Doopie!

880
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!

881
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,740
Oh, definitely!

882
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,440
Oh, this is...

883
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,920
This is Eric!

884
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,430
Doopie!

885
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:16,870
Doopie?

886
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:17,930
Doopie!

887
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,390
Oh!

888
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,670
Don't think we can go back up, I think I...

889
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,370
I guess we're about to meet Doopie 18.

890
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,670
Doobie 17 is gone.

891
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,210
I think it opened up this thing right here.

892
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,150
But I'm scared to go.

893
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,750
Oh, apparently Doobie crashed.

894
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,870
No!

895
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,650
No!

896
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,630
Okay, the timing of that was crazy.

897
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,550
Wait, should we restart?

898
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,090
Do we have to restart?

899
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,170
Yeah, we're pretty early.

900
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,450
Yeah, we're pretty early on because we didn't know what to do.

901
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,550
I kind of want to see what happens.

902
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,830
Alright, you guys want to die to the monster together?

903
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:03,410
Yeah.

904
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,810
Alright, we'll go.

905
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,690
Hopefully it's not too loud.

906
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,510
Sorry, guys.

907
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,730
Prepare your ears.

908
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,470
Wait, where was he?

909
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,390
Over here.

910
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,070
Oh, there he is!

911
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,790
Oh, he's still here.

912
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,510
Alright, who wants to die first?

913
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,730
I'll go!

914
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,090
Alright, we'll watch.

915
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,170
She's gonna get the screenshot!

916
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,330
Oh!

917
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,970
There it is!

918
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,060
Was that you taking a screenshot?

919
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,660
I don't know!

920
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,560
That was crazy!

921
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,160
I'll make a new lobby.

922
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,700
I'll make a new lobby.

923
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
We all ended up back here.

924
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,320
Yeah, we gotta make a new lobby.

925
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,700
Okay, I'm in new lobby.

926
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh, wowie, guys.

927
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:07,960
Um...

928
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,660
Ducky burn.

929
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,200
It

930
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,750
is actually louder!

931
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,030
Oh, it's awfully...

932
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,290
Alright, let me...

933
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,550
Okay, we made a new lobby.

934
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,450
Holy shit!

935
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,170
I did not expect that test.

936
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,810
I...

937
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,770
It's so loud!

938
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, wait, I got pee.

939
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,340
No.

940
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,400
Alright, I...

941
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,340
I...

942
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:52,940
Um...

943
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,560
I messaged Julie that we made a new lobby.

944
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,100
Yeah.

945
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,440
So, we'll just wait.

946
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,740
Yeah, I'm trying to send an invite.

947
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,550
Because I wasn't able to send an invite.

948
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,130
Alright, I'm gonna get water real quick.

949
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,530
I'll be back.

950
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,030
Okay.

951
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,450
Okay.

952
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,900
Oh, sorry.

953
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,860
I'm back.

954
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,240
No, don't be sorry!

955
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,700
No problem.

956
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:13,980
We...

957
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,600
We thought you died horribly.

958
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,140
We did!

959
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,040
We thought you got...

960
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,660
But as soon as we turned the corner...

961
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,580
To go look for you, we found the monster.

962
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,920
I did.

963
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,540
That's what happened.

964
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,400
That's why.

965
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,280
It disconnected me.

966
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm back.

967
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,400
I thought...

968
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh, my God.

969
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,820
Oh, you're back.

970
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,100
You...

971
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,580
You crashed at, like, the perfect time.

972
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,520
We're like...

973
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,960
We're like...

974
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,260
We're like...

975
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,360
We're like...

976
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,380
We're like...

977
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, man.

978
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,340
Hope we got to clone Doobie 17.

979
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,460
And then he disappeared.

980
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,400
Oh,

981
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,700
yeah, yeah, yeah.

982
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah, we know, we know.

983
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,700
Uh...

984
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,850
Yeah, yeah, okay.

985
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,490
We know what the alien does.

986
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,090
We know.

987
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,330
What?

988
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,030
What do you mean?

989
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,570
Uh-oh.

990
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,130
Okay.

991
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,390
Actually, no.

992
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,330
We can watch Doobie also encounter him.

993
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,070
What?

994
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,550
Yeah, Doobie.

995
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:07,930
We all...

996
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,610
It's like an initiation.

997
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,670
We all did it.

998
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,650
We all...

999
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,790
Yeah, exactly.

1000
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,110
Yeah.

1001
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,630
Alright.

1002
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,670
He's friendly, right?

1003
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,550
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:16,850
Yeah.

1005
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:17,870
Oh, yeah.

1006
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,530
Very friendly.

1007
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,250
We all got a hug from him, right, guys?

1008
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:22,910
Uh...

1009
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,330
This isn't related to the picture you guys showed me earlier.

1010
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,070
Um...

1011
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,050
Um...

1012
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,290
Oh!

1013
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,170
There he is!

1014
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,610
Oh, okay.

1015
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,570
There he is.

1016
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,410
Oh!

1017
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,770
He really just does that, doesn't he?

1018
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:36,950
Yeah.

1019
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,550
Yeah.

1020
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,250
Yeah.

1021
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:39,570
Alright.

1022
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,450
Doobie 18.

1023
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:42,850
Woohoo!

1024
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:43,930
Woohoo!

1025
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,350
Woohoo!

1026
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,590
Time to get to work.

1027
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,330
Is this right?

1028
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,770
Wasn't he around here?

1029
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,390
I'm scared.

1030
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,970
Yeah, I think he's around the corner.

1031
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,430
I think he's on the left side.

1032
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,590
We'll watch.

1033
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,110
He's right here.

1034
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,330
Okay, ready?

1035
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,370
I see him.

1036
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,270
Yeah.

1037
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,470
So I'm gonna die him?

1038
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,550
No, no.

1039
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,230
No.

1040
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,870
How do we get him not to see us, though?

1041
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,670
I think we can go left.

1042
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,570
Yeah, I think we have to go around him.

1043
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,210
Yeah.

1044
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,230
Wait, this is just the beginning.

1045
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,350
This is the area.

1046
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,050
Is it?

1047
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,130
Yeah, we looped.

1048
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:12,950
Like a...

1049
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,330
Like a little shortcut area.

1050
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,510
I think because we're supposed to find the lever handle.

1051
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,050
What's this?

1052
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,150
Don't let it see you.

1053
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:19,410
Oh, yeah.

1054
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,370
Don't let it see you.

1055
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,010
Ah, okay.

1056
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,170
Easy?

1057
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,350
That should be easy.

1058
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,990
We could use one of us as bae.

1059
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,710
Okay, Doki.

1060
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,250
Good idea.

1061
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,970
You should go.

1062
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,570
As the idea person here...

1063
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,690
If I die, who else will have all these good ideas?

1064
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,370
He's gone, I think.

1065
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,270
I don't see him.

1066
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,030
Oh, okay.

1067
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,450
Mm-hmm.

1068
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,250
He hears your footsteps?

1069
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,030
Uh-oh.

1070
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:44,550
Oh.

1071
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,230
Uh-oh.

1072
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,790
Okay.

1073
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:46,870
Closed.

1074
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:47,950
Oh.

1075
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,950
You know, like...

1076
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,750
Okay, we looked like that character in...

1077
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:51,950
Oh, I think he's coming.

1078
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,070
Wait.

1079
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,150
Oh.

1080
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,430
Oh.

1081
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,320
Oh.

1082
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm stuck!

1083
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm stuck!

1084
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,790
I'm stuck!

1085
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,510
Yay!

1086
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,230
Oh, my God.

1087
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,330
Oh, my God.

1088
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:24,990
They...

1089
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:30,130
The monster cry threw me on top of my body, so I couldn't move.

1090
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,190
I got...

1091
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,030
It was...

1092
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,950
It was...

1093
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,090
He's...

1094
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,270
He's the Costco guy.

1095
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,310
He's gonna get four big boobs.

1096
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,030
Big boobs.

1097
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,350
Uh...

1098
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,370
Boo!

1099
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,750
Boo!

1100
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,330
Boo!

1101
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,130
How do we do this?

1102
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,970
We just...

1103
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,770
We gotta go right...

1104
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,190
Don't let him see you.

1105
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,430
Yeah, don't let him see you.

1106
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,230
Don't let him see you.

1107
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,990
Yeah, he got all of us.

1108
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,530
That's crazy.

1109
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:57,450
Yeah.

1110
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,950
I was just standing there.

1111
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,290
I thought maybe he wouldn't get me if I just stood still.

1112
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,650
Can he hear our microphone?

1113
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,670
Does that play in there?

1114
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,190
It says...

1115
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,910
Oh, I don't know.

1116
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,270
No, it says, don't let it see you, though.

1117
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,330
No, it also said he hears your footsteps, though.

1118
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,730
Yeah.

1119
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,590
Oh, okay, so we just have to crouch.

1120
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,470
Yeah, I think so.

1121
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,290
Okay, be very, very quiet.

1122
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,170
I'm hunting wabbits.

1123
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,310
Wabbits, yeah.

1124
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,410
I don't wanna see where this line goes.

1125
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,190
Be very, very quiet.

1126
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,250
Be very quiet.

1127
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,930
Okay, I think, like, he...

1128
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,650
He does go back and go forward, so, like, we just gotta wait for him to do that, right?

1129
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,250
Yeah, we know that it's a dead end now, but we can open up this.

1130
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,610
Yeah.

1131
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:34,710
Yeah.

1132
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,350
Yeah, which we...

1133
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,270
Why don't you guys open the door?

1134
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,350
Thank you.

1135
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,310
Oh my gosh, you scared me!

1136
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:43,690
Alright.

1137
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,150
We just gotta wait for him to come back.

1138
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,710
And then he'll, like, go forward.

1139
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,510
Oh, right, yeah, cause we have to make the first right?

1140
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,670
Yeah, I think so.

1141
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,830
And then he did come back.

1143
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,870
But I think he'll see us here, right?

1144
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,890
He did before.

1145
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,650
Oh, wait.

1146
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,590
Oh, wait, no.

1147
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,270
There was a...

1148
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,710
No, no, no.

1149
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,170
Cause, like, Nimi ran up to him, remember?

1150
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:02,830
Oh, that's...

1151
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,230
I did run up to him.

1152
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,230
That's right, that's right.

1153
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,270
Yeah, so I...

1154
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,930
Maybe he's, like...

1155
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,730
You know, like, there's some animals that can't see, like, more than, like, five feet?

1156
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,150
You can hear him coming, too.

1157
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,790
Like, things just get...

1158
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,190
It's like how, like, crocodiles can't see in front of them.

1159
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,390
Oh, there you go.

1160
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,710
See?

1161
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,210
Let's shimmy over.

1162
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,880
Why are we laughing?

1163
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,300
Because I don't think we should be in the dead end.

1164
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, there was a thing here.

1165
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:34,980
Oh.

1166
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,780
Can we turn our flashlights off?

1167
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,720
Okay.

1168
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,800
Uh, now what?

1169
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,920
Guys, I think it's a bad idea.

1170
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,100
I think we should...

1171
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,680
Should we go?

1172
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,180
Why?

1173
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,520
You didn't have to follow me!

1174
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,360
You were the leader!

1175
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
You were the leader!

1176
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,380
Okay.

1177
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,340
Wait, maybe we're fine.

1178
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,200
Maybe we can go.

1179
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,160
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1180
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,260
I don't hear him.

1181
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,900
Let's go.

1182
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,020
Maybe he jumped out the window.

1183
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,060
Yeah, maybe he could.

1184
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,580
Yeah, yeah.

1185
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,060
You know what?

1186
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,640
I believe that.

1187
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,100
Maybe he jumped off the building.

1188
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:05,820
Oh!

1189
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,400
I don't think he jumped off the building.

1190
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,980
I don't think he jumped off the building.

1191
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,920
I think only doki's alive will never make it.

1192
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,690
I think only doki's alive will never...

1193
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,370
will never...

1194
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,390
get anywhere.

1195
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,090
What?

1196
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,520
Oh!

1197
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,860
Ah!

1198
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,630
I'm okay.

1199
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:48,910
I'm okay.

1200
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,150
I'm okay.

1201
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,890
I can like hear you barely.

1202
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,930
You're so quiet.

1203
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,030
Yeah.

1204
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,370
Is it just me?

1205
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,710
I'm fine.

1206
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,750
You're so quiet.

1207
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,150
Hello?

1208
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,030
Oh.

1209
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,930
Wait, write a message.

1210
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,410
I'll be a hero.

1211
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,510
Can you hear me?

1212
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,270
I don't think they can.

1213
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,490
I can't hear...

1214
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,310
Oh, they are the...

1215
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,510
I think maybe the bodies are proximity, maybe.

1216
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,710
Oh my god, where am I?

1217
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,590
I can see them like they're...

1218
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,450
Oh, kinda.

1219
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,350
Oh!

1220
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:32,830
Hello!

1221
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,890
She's doing it.

1222
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,770
There's the lever!

1223
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,650
Right?

1224
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:42,670
Why?

1225
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,430
Is that...

1226
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,190
Doki!

1227
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,410
Is that not the lever?

1228
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,840
You're not stuck.

1229
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,360
You're nowhere else to go.

1230
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
You gotta find the lever, Doki!

1231
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,910
It's so quiet.

1232
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,250
No!

1233
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,880
I miss it.

1234
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,680
Oh.

1235
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,360
Uh-oh.

1236
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
Nobody sees me here, right?

1237
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,400
No!

1238
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,070
How did she live?

1239
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,090
Is that not the lever right there?

1240
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:33,930
Oh, see, see, see.

1241
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,750
Oh, it's something.

1242
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,270
I think that's the lever!

1243
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,570
I'm the main character.

1244
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,410
I think so.

1245
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,130
Gaming?

1246
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,670
They sound like little ants to me.

1247
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,090
Oh.

1248
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,530
Oh.

1249
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,150
Oh no, don't die here.

1250
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,370
Don't die here.

1251
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,730
Come on.

1252
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,700
What is that?

1253
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Is that a monitor?

1254
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,860
She can take it back.

1255
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,340
Maybe.

1256
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,360
I don't...

1257
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,780
Does she know how to get back?

1258
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh!

1259
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,260
She made it.

1260
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,360
I did it.

1261
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,720
Oh my god, I did it.

1262
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,440
I saved the run!

1263
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,840
Yay!

1264
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,560
Okay, guys, I did it.

1265
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,700
Guys, I'm a hero.

1266
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,900
You're welcome.

1267
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,660
You're welcome.

1268
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,460
We're

1269
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:55,970
back!

1270
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,830
Thank you!

1271
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,010
You did it, Doki.

1272
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,070
You did it!

1273
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,090
You did it!

1274
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,220
It's like, surprise!

1275
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't have any faith in you.

1276
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,860
That's right!

1277
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,040
That was amazing!

1278
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,200
Bro, when he was like in... I was just up here in the corner, and he just walked past me.

1279
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,640
Yeah!

1280
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,720
Wow!

1281
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,660
They were gaming.

1282
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,640
Oh, we're outside!

1283
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,340
Oh my god.

1284
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,760
We're outside now, yeah!

1285
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,640
We're down the street.

1286
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,960
Wait, we can go see the little kid.

1287
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,760
Yay!

1288
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,460
I think they're gone.

1289
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,740
I think they're inside.

1290
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,820
You better hide.

1291
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,560
Wait, what does that mean?

1292
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,260
But we're outside!

1293
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm gonna hide.

1294
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,140
I'm gonna hide back in...

1295
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,420
I'm gonna hide back in...

1296
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,020
Let me turn around!

1297
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,560
Did anyone survive?

1298
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,840
What am I supposed to do?

1299
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,040
Get into the library.

1300
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,400
Over here?

1301
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,100
Is this the library?

1302
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,820
It looks...

1303
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,380
Uh...

1304
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,020
I think it is.

1305
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,140
Wait.

1306
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,440
Yeah!

1307
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,240
What was that?

1308
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,240
What happened?

1309
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,280
I don't know.

1310
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,200
I was...

1311
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,920
I was unlocked.

1312
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,140
Because Doofy was like not moving.

1313
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,220
I was changing his setting.

1314
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,460
I was trying to fix his setting.

1315
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,780
When died or others...

1316
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,520
The players become...

1317
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:27,900
When they're...

1318
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,940
This is like basically how to revive people.

1319
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,580
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1320
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:30,860
Alright.

1321
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,740
What was that thing though?

1322
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,440
That was crazy.

1323
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,140
I don't know.

1324
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,740
That was higher.

1325
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,480
It was crazy.

1326
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah, it was a god headspotter.

1327
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,420
Oh, shoot.

1328
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
Oh, you carry three items.

1329
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,620
Yeah, yeah.

1330
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,080
Oh.

1331
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,740
We just have to follow the lives.

1332
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,700
Storage of electrical...

1333
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,200
Okay, we get...

1334
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh, wait.

1335
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,920
We have electrical boxes?

1336
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
Oh, where'd you get those?

1337
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,420
Electrical boxes and apply them to empty slots of electrical circuits.

1338
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,060
I got a computer.

1339
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,060
Oh.

1340
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:57,760
Nice.

1341
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:58,780
Oh, nice.

1342
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,300
Feel it.

1343
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Electrical boxes.

1344
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,380
I use gaming computers.

1345
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,820
That's good.

1346
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,720
Gaming PC?

1347
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,200
What's this?

1348
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,220
Complete the electrical circuit and...

1349
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,640
Provide power to the door to unlock it.

1350
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,220
Oh.

1351
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:10,640
Do it for me.

1352
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,800
Or take a seat.

1353
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,000
We gotta provide power to the door.

1354
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,840
That's what it's saying.

1355
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,340
Alright.

1356
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,260
But I have...

1357
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,860
I have one of the electrical...

1358
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,360
Oh, there you go.

1359
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,980
I found one.

1360
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,620
Yeah, I found an empty slot.

1361
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:23,840
Oh!

1362
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,800
I found it!

1363
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,280
It's like there are like little squares on the thing.

1364
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,260
Oh!

1365
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1366
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,340
So you gotta like apply it.

1367
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:32,600
Okay, okay.

1368
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,620
Is there another one here?

1369
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,220
I see, I see.

1370
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,500
Oh.

1371
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,320
They're all gone.

1372
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, one here.

1373
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,280
One on me, one on me.

1374
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,580
Oh.

1375
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,500
There.

1376
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,220
Okay.

1377
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,820
Nice.

1378
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,660
I have one more.

1379
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,540
One here, one here.

1380
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,520
Yeah.

1381
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,220
Nice.

1382
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,900
There has to be another one.

1383
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,860
Where did you find the first couple?

1384
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,480
Oh.

1385
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,000
We put that in here.

1386
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,580
Nothing in there.

1387
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,100
Oh, there's one here.

1388
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,560
But we don't have any more like...

1389
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Unlock the door first.

1390
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,400
Unlock the door first.

1391
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:12,940
Yeah.

1392
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,220
Oh, yeah.

1393
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,280
Like a...

1394
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,140
Maybe we have to unlock this door first.

1395
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,420
Which one?

1396
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,760
Is there one we can take from...

1397
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,260
This...

1398
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,340
This one on the other side.

1399
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,020
Can you change them out?

1400
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,580
Green.

1401
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,780
Cause I think we have to unlock the...

1402
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,440
The door.

1403
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,500
The...

1404
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,510
Green.

1405
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,010
Yeah, I'm gonna take this one.

1406
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,950
Maybe...

1407
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,550
Maybe this one over here first.

1408
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:40,890
Yeah.

1409
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,450
The one by the entrance.

1410
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,770
Wait, so if I take this...

1411
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,370
One...

1412
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,670
I have one more.

1413
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,230
I took it from the other side.

1414
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,890
If we put here...

1415
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,750
Right on.

1416
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:51,550
Looks like a weed.

1417
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:52,430
Oh, here.

1418
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,070
Okay.

1419
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,670
And then you put one...

1420
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:54,770
Here.

1421
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,570
Oh, it does look like a weed.

1422
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,430
No, no.

1423
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,990
I think we gotta do this one first.

1424
00:44:59,150 --> 00:44:59,470
Hold on.

1425
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,250
Oh, okay.

1426
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,250
I think we do...

1427
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,430
Here.

1428
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,910
Right?

1429
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:05,990
No, no.

1430
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,210
Apply.

1431
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,270
Empty slide.

1432
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,010
And then...

1433
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,090
It goes...

1434
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,070
To the right side first.

1435
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,670
Oh, wait.

1436
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,670
This doesn't go anywhere.

1437
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,850
Yeah, I don't know where...

1438
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,930
It all meets up.

1439
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,190
I thought it was in this door.

1440
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,870
I think it's all connected.

1441
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,490
I think we have to do...

1442
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:24,830
This side.

1443
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,590
This wall first.

1444
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,250
The way to the left side.

1445
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,050
Computer's gonna get wet.

1446
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,530
Your precious computer.

1447
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,170
Your computer.

1448
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,170
The gaming PC.

1449
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:33,150
Okay.

1450
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,430
I'm gonna do the left side.

1451
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,030
Is that...

1452
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:36,410
Up there?

1453
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,390
No.

1454
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,430
There's an item in my pocket.

1455
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,370
Uh...

1456
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,190
I have one extra for this side.

1457
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,330
But there's anything else.

1458
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,450
Where does it go?

1459
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,930
Wait, maybe there's something...

1460
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:53,070
Oh.

1461
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,870
Oh look, I found a sword.

1462
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,910
There's two electrical boxes in this...

1463
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,530
Oh!

1464
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,430
Nice!

1465
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,070
Oh!

1466
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,030
Wait, can we crawl through here?

1467
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:03,190
Oh.

1468
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,270
I got one.

1469
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,230
Can you just yoink it?

1470
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:05,850
Yeah.

1471
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:08,530
Hey!

1472
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,450
That's one!

1473
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,190
Wait, why is it not...

1474
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,410
turning green though?

1475
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,290
I got my PC.

1476
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,030
Oh.

1477
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,230
Maybe cause...

1478
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:15,630
Oh!

1479
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,150
I'm so dumb.

1480
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,050
It's all connected.

1481
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,410
Yeah, I think so.

1482
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,530
Over here, over here, over here.

1483
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,950
Wait, where?

1484
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:25,550
Right there?

1485
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,530
Oh, I see it, I see it.

1486
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,490
And now it should all be connected.

1487
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,470
We just missed that one.

1488
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,490
Yeah, okay, okay.

1489
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,270
That was...

1490
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,250
That one was hidden.

1491
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,230
Yeah, we solved the puzzle!

1492
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,170
Yay!

1493
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,390
Yay!

1494
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,630
Our brain screwed three times that day.

1495
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,150
There

1496
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,580
was a monster running around over here.

1497
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,780
Wait, install the monitor.

1498
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,700
That's what this monitor's for!

1499
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,800
Doobie, your time!

1500
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:56,700
Yeah!

1501
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,580
Your time, it's your time to shine!

1502
00:46:59,320 --> 00:46:59,860
Where do...

1503
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,300
Oh, right here?

1504
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,860
No, this is input device one.

1505
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,080
Wait, do we need the transmitter?

1506
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,280
Uh-oh.

1507
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:07,580
Uh-oh.

1508
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,640
Is that what they're telling us?

1509
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,820
It's just a book and song.

1510
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
No, no, I have one of the devices.

1511
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,180
I want to play with this puzzle.

1512
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:13,880
You guys can't...

1513
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,680
I'm done with this toy.

1514
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,740
I want to play with this new toy.

1515
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,500
I believe in you.

1516
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,040
Wait, yeah, actually...

1517
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,120
Please do that, Wardens.

1518
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,200
Yeah, we'll watch...

1519
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,960
This is the...

1520
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,380
We'll watch Doobie solve this puzzle.

1521
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:25,740
Yeah.

1522
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,340
Wait.

1523
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,340
This is too...

1524
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,740
No pressure.

1525
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,280
No pressure.

1526
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:28,980
No pressure.

1527
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:29,880
No, no, no.

1528
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,480
All three of us are watching right now.

1529
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,640
You got this.

1530
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,360
Maybe I messed it up.

1531
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,420
No, you didn't.

1532
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,620
No, yo.

1533
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,800
I believe in you.

1534
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,340
I'm gonna start backseating.

1535
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,820
I think it's a pie.

1536
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,020
I think it's a pie.

1537
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,140
Streamer, why didn't you move that tile shape down?

1538
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,040
You have to slide the tile.

1539
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,060
Oh my god.

1540
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,360
You just had it.

1541
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,800
Slide it the way that I would slide it, I think.

1542
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,920
Too realistic.

1543
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,320
Move that one.

1544
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,220
Move that one.

1545
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,120
Move that one.

1546
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,740
Streamer, you should have moved the other one.

1547
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,640
You just had it.

1548
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,420
You had the...

1549
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,280
Oh my gosh, Streamer.

1550
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,300
Why did you do that?

1551
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,820
Move.

1552
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,500
I solved it in two seconds.

1553
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,500
My bad.

1554
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,100
Um...

1555
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,300
My child was able to solve this.

1556
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,500
Yeah!

1557
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,110
A special book!

1558
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:39,950
A special book!

1559
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:40,290
A special book!

1560
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,190
I knew she could do it.

1561
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,070
Wait, is that a Ouija board?

1562
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,010
A Luigi board?

1563
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,730
A Luigi board?

1564
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,390
I think we need a cable.

1565
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,710
I'm pretty sure we have to move forward, right?

1566
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,490
There's a...

1567
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,770
There's a monster running about.

1568
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,450
So, uh...

1569
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,890
If you go outside, be careful.

1570
00:48:59,110 --> 00:48:59,250
Yeah.

1571
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,630
I mean, we could come back here.

1572
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,990
What's the book do?

1573
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,810
I think we put it...

1574
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,230
Oh, it's a...

1575
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,750
There was like that one room.

1576
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,570
Remember that office we unlocked?

1577
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,010
Yeah, yeah.

1578
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,010
They said we could like...

1579
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,510
Keep it.

1580
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:11,210
Oh.

1581
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,930
Maybe there's gonna be a safe room or something.

1582
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,130
Yeah.

1583
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,070
Put it there.

1584
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,510
I'll... I'll read it.

1585
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,530
It's my...

1586
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,070
Fan fiction.

1587
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:17,490
I'll bring the...

1588
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,270
I'll bring the special board.

1589
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,270
We gotta go.

1590
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,590
To install this, we have to defeat the monster.

1591
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:24,330
No...

1592
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,330
I'm scared.

1593
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:25,930
Defeat?

1594
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,150
There's something outside.

1595
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,330
I saw it run in the hallway upstairs.

1596
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,870
Oh, there's a safe spot here.

1597
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:31,550
Oh, nice.

1598
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,690
Yeah, yeah.

1599
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,130
Oh, this is...

1600
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:36,850
Yeah, this is...

1601
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:36,990
Wait.

1602
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,270
This is...

1603
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:38,390
Wait.

1604
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,330
Isn't this the elevator we went down to the basement before?

1605
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,610
Oh, so we have to go back.

1606
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:43,130
Yeah, yeah.

1607
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,010
Yeah, so if we go this way...

1608
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:44,470
Oh, we go back.

1609
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:45,050
Yeah.

1610
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,510
Oh, then we like plug in these for the...

1611
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,890
The...

1612
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,150
Our room.

1613
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,270
Yeah, I think so.

1614
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,770
Our sweet gaming room.

1615
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,190
Wait.

1616
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,750
Did you hear that?

1617
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,690
You hear that?

1618
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:54,830
Did you hear that?

1619
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:55,430
Hahahaha.

1620
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:01,470
Fako!

1621
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:01,930
Wait.

1622
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,870
This is where I saw the monster running around.

1623
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,710
It's a snake!

1624
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,130
We ate it!

1625
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:06,890
Awww.

1626
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,760
It's, a...

1627
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:10,900
It's a...

1628
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,240
It's a...

1629
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,960
It's an ink monster!

1630
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,100
Yeah, looks...

1631
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,780
Like stems from...

1632
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,840
Ah, he's friendly!

1633
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,920
Hey, look guys.

1634
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,860
What's that?

1635
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,580
Is that a robot waifu?

1636
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,320
Wait, what?

1637
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,700
A waifu?

1638
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,600
Yeah, you see her?

1639
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,240
Oh, she is kind of leaning into the wall.

1640
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,440
Oh, wait.

1641
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,240
Oh, shit.

1642
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:30,800
Yeah.

1643
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,460
Yeah.

1644
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,320
That's scary.

1645
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,100
You guys shouldn't get too close to that.

1646
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,820
She's like that... like the girl version of that Resident Evil guy.

1647
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,620
Hey, you looking for something too?

1648
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,600
Oh, yeah.

1649
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,920
Oh, I see.

1650
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,440
Yeah, I'm looking for a partner.

1651
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,420
A wife.

1652
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,320
She's like the...

1653
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,340
The guy in Resident Evil 2?

1654
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
Oh, what are you buying?

1655
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,700
No, no, no, no, no.

1656
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,800
Is it Resident Evil 2?

1657
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,980
The guy that chases you in a trench coat with like a girl version.

1658
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,680
Wait, what did we give her?

1659
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,940
The worm.

1660
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,520
Keyboard, please.

1661
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,200
The moon?

1662
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,980
How can the moon even be there?

1663
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,800
Oh, I have the keyboard.

1664
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,340
The worm is being really noisy behind me.

1665
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,300
I don't like it.

1666
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,240
She sounds really wet.

1667
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,920
Oh, this is Mrs. X.

1668
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,960
But she has anime eyes.

1669
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:15,840
Look at this.

1670
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,860
Oh, look at her eyes.

1671
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,960
Look at her eyes.

1672
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,240
Look at her eyes.

1673
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,300
No objective.

1674
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,900
Find out the password.

1675
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,620
Use chat with the manager.

1676
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,360
Bro thinks he's part of the team.

1677
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,620
Yeah.

1678
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,700
Inky, get out of here.

1679
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,240
That's chat.

1680
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,220
Get out of here.

1681
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,000
This is chat.

1682
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,780
This is chat.

1683
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,000
Hey, guys.

1684
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,900
Hey, guys.

1685
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm here to help with that puzzle from earlier.

1686
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,770
How do we find the password?

1687
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,170
Use chat with a ma...

1688
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:02,930
What the fuck is this?

1689
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,670
At chat.

1690
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,630
What's the password?

1691
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,010
He's in here.

1692
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,030
He's making the ground nasty.

1693
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,130
You're disgusting.

1694
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:11,970
Shower.

1695
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:12,590
Shower now.

1696
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,330
You're not an indoor...

1697
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,530
I'm sorry.

1698
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:19,450
I'm sorry.

1699
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,090
I'm sorry.

1700
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,110
I'm sorry.

1701
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:22,630
That

1702
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,860
was a little fun of him.

1703
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,960
I learned my lesson.

1704
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,380
I learned my lesson.

1705
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,700
What you did?

1706
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,180
You got angry.

1707
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,640
You said that to him.

1708
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:58,620
Wait.

1709
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,420
What?

1710
00:52:59,680 --> 00:52:59,740
What?

1711
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,360
Oh,

1712
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,060
wait.

1713
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,260
No.

1714
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,100
We can revive her at the save point right here.

1715
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,220
Oh, yeah.

1716
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,680
Where are you?

1717
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,000
She went the wrong way.

1718
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,640
Oh, there we go.

1719
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,300
Hi, guys.

1720
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:22,820
Hi.

1721
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,100
Hold on, I gotta get the monitor.

1722
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,880
I dropped it.

1723
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,260
I'm ready.

1724
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:31,680
Okay.

1725
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,840
Wait, no, we went the other way before.

1726
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,140
Is it the elevator?

1727
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,620
No, we went this way before.

1728
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,120
I think we just got unlucky.

1729
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,560
Oh, okay.

1730
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,500
Yeah, we did.

1731
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,680
We literally went over and then just slammed us.

1732
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:46,460
Yeah.

1733
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,360
I took one for the team.

1734
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,200
Where did it come from?

1735
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,500
I thought I heard it.

1736
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,700
Don't reach out angry.

1737
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,740
The worm is not friendly.

1738
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,120
Whoever said that.

1739
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,660
Just ignore him.

1740
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,240
Yeah, ignore him.

1741
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,400
You were so mean to him.

1742
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,800
You think he heard me insulting him?

1743
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,480
Talk to the anime girl again.

1744
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,160
Guys, you summoned.

1745
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,140
He's unemployed.

1746
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,840
I'm sorry.

1747
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,420
I'm sorry.

1748
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,140
I don't mean to tell you to shower.

1749
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,440
I got a special book.

1750
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,380
Don't look at him.

1751
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:27,940
Don't even look at him.

1752
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,580
Yeah, don't even look at him.

1753
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,180
Enter the password.

1754
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,740
What's a four letter?

1755
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,580
He can open doors.

1756
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,500
He can open doors.

1757
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,320
The password is eight zero zero eight.

1758
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,000
Boob.

1759
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,180
There's no letters.

1760
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,180
I mean, there's no numbers.

1761
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,980
We can do regular.

1762
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,220
Wait, is it?

1763
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:50,900
B-O-O, yeah.

1764
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,140
Yeah, we can just do actual boob.

1765
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,380
Yeah, just actually write boob.

1766
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,200
I don't think that's it.

1767
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,360
Just chat with the manager.

1768
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,280
Yeah.

1769
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,860
You think it's mood?

1770
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,360
Somebody has to go woo the manager.

1771
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,520
Who's the manager?

1772
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,360
Yeah.

1773
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:10,840
I think it's that lady.

1774
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,880
I want to speak to your manager.

1775
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,280
Oh, I got it.

1776
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,440
What was the password?

1777
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,360
It was moon.

1778
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,460
Oh, the transmitter.

1779
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,340
Huge brain.

1780
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,540
Wait.

1781
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,280
What is?

1782
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,380
Oh no, the transmitter.

1783
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,080
Where is it?

1784
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,360
It's right here.

1785
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:29,900
It's right here.

1786
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,980
No, everybody.

1787
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,500
Look!

1788
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,000
Run!

1789
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,960
Get out!

1790
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:36,600
Run!

1791
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:36,900
Run!

1792
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,420
Run!

1793
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,660
What are we doing?

1794
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,500
He appeared!

1795
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,740
He pooped himself.

1796
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,340
Wait.

1797
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,180
Is that?

1798
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,060
Oh, nope, nope.

1799
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,700
That's a bad guy.

1800
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,240
You guys all ran, so, I'm just following you.

1801
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,720
I thought that was Doobie coming out.

1802
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,590
It's Hang on down!

1803
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,060
I feel like.

1804
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,480
Remember when we were holding a transmitter earlier?

1805
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:21,820
Yeah.

1806
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,940
Where did we leave it?

1807
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,000
We should go save somewhere.

1808
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,200
I think so too, yeah.

1809
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,720
Yeah, okay, but where did we leave the transmitter?

1810
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,180
No, it can't be that far.

1811
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:35,920
No.

1812
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,860
I think it was in the basement, no?

1813
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:39,740
Yeah.

1814
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,100
Yeah, no, it had to be.

1815
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,180
We left items.

1816
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Oh, I think it was when... I think it was at the very beginning of the basement.

1817
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,940
The beginning of... Okay, well, that was easy.

1818
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,040
Yeah, we know how to get that.

1819
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah, yeah, with the man, with the slam dunker.

1820
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,800
Well, he's upstairs now, so... Oh, okay.

1821
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,720
Well, we just have to... Okay, we... One of us just has to live.

1822
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,300
Okay.

1823
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,980
All right, I'll stay here.

1824
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,740
Okay.

1825
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,120
It's all on you, doobs.

1826
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,700
No, wait, I don't want to stay.

1827
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,460
It'll be boring.

1828
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,300
We'll be alone.

1829
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,820
Okay, I'm going to crouch walk.

1830
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,380
Yeah, I will be fine.

1831
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,880
Okay, but how... Yeah, I was going to say, how would Doobie know when we're all dead?

1832
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,800
When we never come back.

1833
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,980
We just never come back.

1834
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:31,420
We just... It's just... She waits an hour alone in the room and was like, God, I think she might be dead.

1835
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:31,960
Yeah.

1836
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,600
The Doobie waiting room.

1837
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,480
Where was... Oh, there was a save right at the bottom here, so we could just... Yeah, yeah.

1838
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah.

1839
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,200
I remember.

1840
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:47,800
I remember that, too.

1841
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,420
Me, too.

1842
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,620
The Lobster's probably camping at the save point.

1843
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,460
He probably is.

1844
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,820
I can't believe that it's not, like, a safe point.

1845
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,380
Like, it's a save point, but it's not a safe point.

1846
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,060
It's not safe.

1847
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,180
It's not a safe room.

1848
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,440
Yeah.

1849
00:57:59,440 --> 00:57:59,460
Yeah.

1850
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,500
There is no safe room.

1851
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,360
Okay, let's see.

1852
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,180
Yeah, the room feels pretty safe.

1853
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,380
We all died in there from the ink blob.

1854
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,440
Okay, we go downstairs, right?

1855
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,720
Someone didn't piss him off.

1856
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,620
What?

1857
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,140
I don't... He got pissed off again.

1858
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:21,460
Doobie?

1859
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:21,840
Doobie?

1860
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,260
Oh, wait.

1861
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,140
Did Doobie crash again?

1862
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:24,960
Doobie.

1863
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,060
Doobie.

1864
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh, I hear her.

1865
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,140
I hear her.

1866
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,820
Oh, no, not here.

1867
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,240
Doobie.

1868
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,640
Doobie.

1869
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,420
Doobie, Marko.

1870
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,840
Doob, doob, doobie.

1871
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,080
Doobie?

1872
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:34,520
Doobie?

1873
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,440
Oh, it's like, bad.

1874
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,600
Whoa, what's going on in there?

1875
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,780
Doobie.

1876
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,060
Doobie.

1877
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,700
See all the lights?

1878
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,740
Um, there's an evil creature out there.

1879
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,420
Do you see that?

1880
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,220
I don't see an evil creature.

1881
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
The one that's 12 feet tall?

1882
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,040
Yes!

1883
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:46,820
Come, look.

1884
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,820
Stand right where I'm standing.

1885
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,720
Oh, it's a... No, it's the cat.

1886
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,660
Is that a cat?

1887
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,220
Yeah.

1888
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,820
It has red eyes, so it must be evil.

1889
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,520
Oh, cat, there's evil.

1890
00:58:59,620 --> 00:58:59,620
He's scanning.

1891
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,480
No.

1892
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:01,300
No.

1893
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,560
Guys, guys, don't look behind me.

1894
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,440
Oh, no.

1895
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,960
Wait, where's Doobie?

1896
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,480
Do you think he got her?

1897
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,800
No, because her body would be coming after us.

1898
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,920
Hi.

1899
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,280
Where are you?

1900
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,540
I see her, I hear her.

1901
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,260
She's like, here.

1902
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,460
Hello.

1903
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,240
Hello.

1904
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,880
All right, we go this way.

1905
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,000
Got an easter egg.

1906
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Easter egg found.

1907
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,460
Basement number two.

1908
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,340
Hey, now where's Min?

1909
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,480
I'm here.

1910
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,560
Oh, you guys are waiting for me.

1911
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:31,940
Sorry.

1912
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,580
It's okay.

1913
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,000
It was in basement number two.

1914
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,520
Yeah.

1915
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:36,480
All right.

1916
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,520
Don't let him on the uncle.

1917
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,140
Wait.

1918
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,320
Yeah, don't let him...

1919
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,880
Wait, we're going to basement two?

1920
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,040
No boys allowed.

1921
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,700
Yeah, it was a transmitter.

1922
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:45,860
Yeah.

1923
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,920
Yeah, it was like right here.

1924
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,080
It's where you all died and I live.

1925
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,120
Oh, yeah, here it is.

1926
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:50,500
Okay, okay.

1927
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,020
And became a hero.

1928
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,320
Oh, he's there, he's there, he's there.

1929
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,500
Okay, one of us, one of us has to live.

1930
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,480
One of us, only really one of us has to go.

1931
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,520
Only one of us transmitted.

1932
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,660
I'm trying to see if I left it over here.

1933
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,340
I'm not avoiding this situation.

1934
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,840
I'm just checking.

1935
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,000
I think it is in that hallway.

1936
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,860
I think so too.

1937
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,280
I think it's where we first initially died.

1938
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,340
Yeah.

1939
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,640
No, like, cause I never came back.

1940
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,920
So it's by the dead end area.

1941
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:26,880
Yeah.

1942
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,880
I'll go.

1943
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:28,860
It's the right one?

1944
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,460
Yeah, no, it's the right side.

1945
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,320
Yeah.

1946
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,820
Yeah, the first dead end on the right.

1947
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,860
Oh, over there?

1948
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,540
I see it.

1949
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,300
Oh, you do?

1950
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,970
Got it.

1951
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:39,610
Alright.

1952
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,730
Yeah, now we go back.

1953
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:42,430
Okay.

1954
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,150
Let's go, let's go, before he sees us.

1955
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,310
Wait, which way is up?

1956
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,390
Um...

1957
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,510
Oh, this way, this way, this way.

1958
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:49,290
Right here, right here.

1959
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:51,630
Okay, that's...

1960
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,390
I like how all of us were hacked.

1961
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,770
That's all we needed?

1962
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:55,830
There wasn't something else?

1963
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,770
Yeah, that was it, I think.

1964
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,630
It was just the transmitter.

1965
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:58,370
Yeah.

1966
01:00:59,230 --> 01:00:59,570
Yippee!

1967
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,730
What's there a way we can summon items that we have had before?

1968
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,110
I don't think so.

1969
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:05,470
I don't know.

1970
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,870
This whole chat's not here anymore.

1971
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,710
Okay, make sure we all save.

1972
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:10,230
Yeah.

1973
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:10,650
Yeah.

1974
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:11,430
Okay, nice.

1975
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:12,590
This way.

1976
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,130
Oh, this way.

1977
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:14,650
Yeah, yeah.

1978
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:16,810
Oh!

1979
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:17,910
You okay?

1980
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:22,610
Screams.

1981
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:22,790
Alright.

1982
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:23,570
Doesn't elaborate.

1983
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,930
Alright.

1984
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,170
What about the sexy lady?

1985
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,110
Should we invite her?

1986
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,710
Are we gonna transmit it to her?

1987
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,090
Yes.

1988
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:34,770
Yes.

1989
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:34,850
Yeah.

1990
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,310
She's the same language.

1991
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,130
Oh!

1992
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,210
And say, oh.

1993
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,090
Talk to the strange lady.

1994
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:41,790
Oh.

1995
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,790
Transmitting data?

1996
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,150
That's it.

1997
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:43,370
Oh!

1998
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,150
Okay.

1999
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:44,910
Oh!

2000
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,230
She's, she's...

2001
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,070
I got her!

2002
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,150
I, I scored!

2003
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:50,530
Step aside!

2004
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:50,810
Step aside!

2005
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,010
I scored the woman!

2006
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,110
Oh my god!

2007
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:55,210
Oh my god!

2008
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:55,830
She's...

2009
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,650
She's mine!

2010
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,910
She's following me!

2011
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,410
Wow, miss!

2012
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,770
You risked her!

2013
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:03,750
I risked her!

2014
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,370
I said...

2015
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,130
I said, dot, dot, dot, and she followed.

2016
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,990
She likes the silent type, huh?

2017
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,370
Yeah!

2018
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,950
Dot, dot, dot.

2019
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:14,690
Ooh!

2020
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:16,910
She said you don't know where to go next.

2021
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:17,530
Oh, she's talking.

2022
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,090
She's talking.

2023
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,010
Let's go there.

2024
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,150
Let's go there.

2025
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,290
Explore the secret passage.

2026
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:22,270
Secret passage?

2027
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:22,950
Oh!

2028
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,350
She's leading us!

2029
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,190
Whoa!

2030
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,490
Wait, will you take this?

2031
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:27,210
Transmitter?

2032
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,790
She has to duck!

2033
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,190
I think we used it!

2034
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:30,590
Yeah!

2035
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,730
I think you could keep it in here, probably.

2036
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2037
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:34,770
Oh!

2038
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,370
Look at her go!

2039
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,090
The tall, big, strong woman!

2040
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:39,630
It's a...

2041
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,930
It's a runway now!

2042
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:41,390
Damn!

2043
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,430
Oh!

2044
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,150
It's America's next taumata!

2045
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:47,390
Oh!

2046
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,030
Oh!

2047
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:48,710
No!

2048
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,730
What's up here?

2049
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,150
Wait, I'm stuck in!

2050
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:53,330
Wait, there's a monster in here.

2051
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:53,690
Hold on.

2052
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:54,210
There is?

2053
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:55,390
There's a guy right there.

2054
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,130
Oh, there's him!

2055
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,090
There's the big guy!

2056
01:02:59,070 --> 01:02:59,470
Yeah.

2057
01:02:59,470 --> 01:02:59,710
Ew!

2058
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:01,390
He'll see you!

2059
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:01,890
Be careful!

2060
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,170
Wait, should we save right here?

2061
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,010
There's a save thing.

2062
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:05,650
Yeah, yeah.

2063
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,130
Let's save.

2064
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,650
Come back, come back.

2065
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,790
Unless we don't see the big, strong lady again.

2066
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,850
Okay, we're good.

2067
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:12,890
Okay, good, good.

2068
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:13,550
Okay.

2069
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,790
It was all a dream.

2070
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,750
Oh, he's walking.

2071
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:18,290
Yeah, he's coming this way.

2072
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:18,750
Oh, no!

2073
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:19,710
Yeah, he just left.

2074
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:20,830
Alright.

2075
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,450
I see her outside.

2076
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,350
Oh, she's outside?

2077
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,690
She's waiting for us in the rain.

2078
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:26,150
Yeah.

2079
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,890
Oh, wait, I wanna see.

2080
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:27,190
That's so cute.

2081
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,090
Oh, sorry.

2082
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,830
See, look out the window over there.

2083
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,870
I don't know if you see your girlfriend.

2084
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:33,090
Oh, I see her.

2085
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:33,890
Yeah, she's over there.

2086
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,150
Wait, I hear some...

2087
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,250
What are you looking at?

2088
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:38,690
Is that her?

2089
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,270
She heard that?

2090
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,390
Footsteps?

2091
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:41,470
Oh.

2092
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:42,670
Her foot...

2093
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:43,350
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2094
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:44,110
He's walking around.

2095
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:45,390
Oh.

2096
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,790
Oh, there she is.

2097
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:49,230
I see her.

2098
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:49,830
Okay, good.

2099
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:50,590
Yeah.

2100
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,030
As long as he doesn't see us.

2101
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:53,910
Our anime girlfriend.

2102
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,290
He's coming, he's coming.

2103
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:56,610
Oh.

2104
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,830
Oh.

2105
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,970
Guys, I don't think Doobie lives.

2106
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,670
We can go save.

2107
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:03,270
Ah!

2108
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,490
Uh...

2109
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,570
Did Doki live?

2110
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,130
Hello?

2111
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:12,950
You got five?

2112
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,020
Wait!

2113
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:26,880
I think I have to press it again.

2114
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,200
Yeah, where's Doki?

2115
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:28,680
Hi, Doki!

2116
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,880
I started hearing her scream from far away.

2117
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:39,730
Um...

2118
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:40,410
Oh, it's got a cooldown.

2119
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:40,910
Yeah.

2120
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,150
Oh, I see.

2121
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,190
Wait, that's weird that it let us...

2122
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:47,070
Yeah.

2123
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:47,870
Again?

2124
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:48,370
Oh!

2125
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,010
Yay!

2126
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,990
I literally died the moment Nimi responded, you guys.

2127
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,430
Yeah!

2128
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,450
He's like right there, hold on.

2129
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,290
Oh, yeah.

2130
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,850
He's tough.

2131
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,570
He's a big strong man.

2132
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,070
Yeah.

2133
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,390
He's out here getting ready for basketball.

2134
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,950
Oh.

2135
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:13,590
Oh.

2136
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:15,890
He scares me.

2137
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,450
Alright.

2138
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,440
Shining in his eyes.

2139
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,200
Yeah.

2140
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,540
Yeah.

2141
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,000
He looks like an actual imposter.

2142
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,820
He reminds me of the Slenderman.

2143
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,480
Yeah.

2144
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,300
Explore the hole in the wall to the outside.

2145
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:37,900
He looks like Slenderman.

2146
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,280
So we gotta go outside.

2147
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:41,500
Alright.

2148
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,020
Somehow.

2149
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:43,860
Oh, gosh.

2150
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,160
Is he just walking back and forth?

2151
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,740
I think he sees one of us.

2152
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:33,290
I think he sees one of us.

2153
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,150
And it was you.

2154
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,010
You cannot powerslide in this.

2155
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:40,650
Kinda sucks.

2156
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:42,250
It's my last words.

2157
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,470
It's my last

2158
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,300
words.

2159
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:58,940
Aww.

2160
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,760
Mimi's so brave.

2161
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,980
Let's go, Nimi.

2162
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:23,650
Okay, we're safe.

2163
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:24,510
No!

2164
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,330
Chad got her!

2165
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,350
Chad got her!

2166
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,870
Oh, no way.

2167
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:29,830
Yeah.

2168
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:30,850
Yeah, look at...

2169
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,390
Is she gonna come over here and get me?

2170
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,950
No?

2171
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:38,370
Yeah, come over.

2172
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,490
We gotta bring her back.

2173
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,540
He came through the wall.

2174
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,280
Oh, my God.

2175
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,340
He was trying to get me.

2176
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,960
Wait, do you guys hear that?

2177
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,500
You hear footsteps, right?

2178
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,040
I hear footsteps.

2179
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:55,540
Yeah.

2180
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,220
Do you guys hear that?

2181
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,800
I heard it last time, too.

2182
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:58,980
Hello.

2183
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,880
Hello, welcome back.

2184
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,240
Hello.

2185
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,180
Hello.

2186
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,200
Did you guys got grabbed by chat?

2187
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,420
No, no.

2188
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,260
It was the big guy.

2189
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:06,720
What was that?

2190
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,220
Oh, yeah.

2191
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,400
Oh, he's...

2192
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,740
He's coming through the wall.

2193
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,680
He's got tentacles.

2194
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,980
Wait, maybe I'll stay here and distract him.

2195
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,060
You guys go forward.

2196
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:15,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2197
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,320
Wait, actually, he went back, I think.

2198
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,380
I think he went back, yeah.

2199
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,020
Okay, I think...

2200
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:20,700
Okay, I got a plan.

2201
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,500
One of us has to be bait.

2202
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,200
And then the other...

2203
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:23,520
Oh, wait.

2204
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,040
I think if you get into the other room, you can open the door there.

2205
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:26,400
Yeah.

2206
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,780
Only one of us has to live.

2207
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:29,940
Only one of us has to live.

2208
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,220
I mean, if we all die, we just go...

2209
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,480
We spawn right back at that safe spot, so...

2210
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:34,740
Yeah, that's true.

2211
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:34,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2212
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,300
So there.

2213
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,520
Only one of us has...

2214
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:38,660
I'll distract him.

2215
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,780
I'll distract him.

2216
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,600
Don't worry, guys.

2217
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,540
No, I...

2218
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,580
Okay, you be the hero.

2219
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,680
Go, Doobie, go!

2220
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,980
Go, Doobie, go!

2221
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,160
Go, Doobie, go!

2222
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:51,570
Or...

2223
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,330
Oh.

2224
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,810
Okay, I don't think she...

2225
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,920
I'm somewhere.

2226
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,920
There's a map?

2227
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,300
Hello?

2228
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,210
Oh, hey, guys.

2229
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,950
We all live.

2230
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,810
Yeah, but...

2231
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,850
Where do we go?

2232
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:29,970
Where do we go?

2233
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:35,510
It says we're supposed to go outside, but...

2234
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:37,550
There's supposed...

2235
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,510
There's supposed...

2236
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:38,990
There's supposedly a map?

2237
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,550
Oh, he's over there.

2238
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:41,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2239
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,370
Can't...

2240
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,450
What is this?

2241
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,900
Wait, he's coming though.

2242
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,950
Go, Doobie!

2243
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,390
Save yourself!

2244
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,050
Come on here.

2245
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:11,650
There's nothing.

2246
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,310
There's nothing in front of us.

2247
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:14,110
Okay.

2248
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,590
Uh, it's just...

2249
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,030
I was the distraction.

2250
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,030
Should?

2251
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,310
Oh, gosh.

2252
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:25,410
Uh-oh.

2253
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:27,510
Ow!

2254
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,470
Ow, gosh!

2255
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,070
Oh, she made it.

2256
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:32,510
Wow.

2257
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,110
Look at the cone is going!

2258
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:34,630
Oh, no.

2259
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,230
I don't know what the body...

2260
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:36,710
Ew!

2261
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,010
What?

2262
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,070
I don't know what the...

2263
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:40,650
What the hell is that?

2264
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,550
Oh, my god!

2265
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,930
From before?

2266
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,290
Oh, it's just stopping her.

2267
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,610
What is the goal here?

2268
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,290
Oh, she made it back in.

2269
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,320
Oh, she made it back in.

2270
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,270
I think Nimi will...

2271
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:20,590
Oh, what's that right there?

2272
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,210
Oh, some books.

2273
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:25,820
Oh.

2274
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,220
Can you see me?

2275
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,680
I think she's...

2276
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,530
Oh, no!

2277
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,590
You're not still alive!

2278
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,460
She's got a...

2279
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,520
Oh, he's here!

2280
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,060
Oh, god!

2281
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:05,860
The inky man!

2282
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,080
Oh, I can't hear them again.

2283
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,320
There's too many!

2284
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,260
Wait, is there a safe room?

2285
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,700
Is that where?

2286
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,980
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

2287
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,100
That's the third floor, but where's the safe?

2288
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:23,370
The basement?

2289
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,600
That's so unfair!

2290
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:38,740
There.

2291
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:42,940
One lucky!

2292
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,420
You left Nimi!

2293
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,740
Where did you live?

2294
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,380
You were the chosen one.

2295
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,660
But we know where the door is now.

2296
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,780
You were the chosen one!

2297
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:50,860
Yeah.

2298
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,220
Oh, I think it's open.

2299
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,520
Oh wait, no, it didn't save.

2300
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,960
We didn't save it.

2301
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:55,780
I don't...

2302
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,120
I don't think we need that door.

2303
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,520
We know how to go outside.

2304
01:12:59,220 --> 01:12:59,840
That's true.

2305
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,660
I think it would be good to open it though, just in case.

2306
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:04,720
Alright, okay, okay, so...

2307
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,000
This door?

2308
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:05,720
Alright.

2309
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,580
Is there anything else in here?

2310
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,500
What do we have to do in?

2311
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,220
There is a place!

2312
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:13,600
Oh!

2313
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,580
In here!

2314
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,160
Oh!

2315
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,420
Everybody left.

2316
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,920
If you...

2317
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,900
If you lose an item, like the flashlight or something, you can...

2318
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,740
You can get it back in that room.

2319
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:26,440
Oh yeah, there's a thing!

2320
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,380
Wait, which room?

2321
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,040
I've got the door.

2322
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:28,960
Oh, nice!

2323
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,660
Alright.

2324
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,800
In this room, see?

2325
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:31,740
Oh!

2326
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,280
Yeah.

2327
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,920
Alright, will we save?

2328
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,760
We just save Doobie.

2329
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,480
Yeah, yeah, let's save Doobie.

2330
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,140
Alright, we know how to go outside now.

2331
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:41,880
Yeah, yeah.

2332
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:42,600
We know.

2333
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,500
Okay, so...

2334
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,360
Where the fuck did you go, Nimi?

2335
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,440
How did you go, Nimi?

2336
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,120
She ran!

2337
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,940
I couldn't find the...

2338
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,200
I couldn't find...

2339
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,560
The third floor.

2340
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,420
Oh wait, we can go first.

2341
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,460
I don't know where to go.

2342
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,940
Okay, following you.

2343
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,240
It's like forward and right.

2344
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,340
Damn it.

2345
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:20,690
Okay, who died?

2346
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,310
Uh...

2347
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:23,390
Uh...

2348
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:23,650
Uh...

2349
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:23,990
Uh...

2350
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:26,250
There was always three of us, right?

2351
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:26,930
Uh-oh.

2352
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,370
The other thing is there.

2353
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,270
I think...

2354
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,330
Nimi went, uh, forward from here and then right...

2355
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,070
Yeah, yeah, I don't know where she was.

2356
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,110
Oh, she's the only one that knew where to go!

2357
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:41,490
She was the only one!

2358
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:41,650
Uh-oh.

2359
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,630
Uh-oh.

2360
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:50,630
Uh-oh.

2361
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,970
Yeah, see?

2362
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:52,890
He's just friendly.

2363
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,490
Oh, we found it.

2364
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:54,830
Nice.

2365
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:56,730
Good job, Doobie.

2366
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:57,930
Good job, Doobie.

2367
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,190
There's a guy right here, though.

2368
01:14:59,530 --> 01:14:59,990
He's right here.

2369
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:00,570
He's right here.

2370
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,370
Just run!

2371
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:01,670
Just run!

2372
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:02,510
It'll kill one of us!

2373
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:03,790
It'll kill me!

2374
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,570
I don't wanna die!

2375
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:07,650
I'm already dead!

2376
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:08,090
Please!

2377
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,010
I died once!

2378
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:17,490
I think there's also another guy in here.

2379
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:20,030
There were the little inky guys in here.

2380
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,090
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2381
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:21,690
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2382
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:22,650
We'll...

2383
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:24,110
Let's just find a save point.

2384
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:25,470
Yeah.

2385
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:26,590
Ow!

2386
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,810
There's a really loud sound in here!

2387
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,050
Yeah, I heard it.

2388
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:29,470
Oh!

2389
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:30,670
Oh!

2390
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:31,430
I am going!

2391
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,360
It's me.

2392
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:36,060
I'm dead.

2393
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,880
I'm dead.

2394
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,560
Goodbye, world!

2395
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,300
Goodbye!

2396
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,320
Goodbye, world!

2397
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,880
Don't lock me out.

2398
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:48,550
No, I think...

2399
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,630
She found a save point!

2400
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:50,770
Ah!

2401
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,490
There's inky's!

2402
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,370
She's trying...

2403
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,810
She's trying to save!

2404
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:57,250
She's trying so hard to save!

2405
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,070
Where are you, Doobie?

2406
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,990
Doobie!

2407
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,830
Doobie!

2408
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:02,410
Doobie!

2409
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,140
Doobie!

2410
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:06,320
This way?

2411
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,740
Doobie, we don't know where the save is!

2412
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,400
We're inky!

2413
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,780
Maybe in the computer room.

2414
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:12,720
I'm gonna...

2415
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,420
Oh, you guys alive?

2416
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,320
Yeah, yeah.

2417
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,920
We saw you spamming the save.

2418
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,040
Ah!

2419
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:18,700
Ah!

2420
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,420
Ah!

2421
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:20,680
There's a save right here!

2422
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,300
Save, save, save!

2423
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:21,600
Okay.

2424
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:22,600
Yay!

2425
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,620
Oh my gosh!

2426
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:25,040
Oh my gosh!

2427
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,220
How could you forget?

2428
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,340
I was only gone for two minutes!

2429
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,800
When you're scared, we start forgetting.

2430
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:35,640
What's this?

2431
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,980
Oh, wait, that's how you remove the...

2432
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:39,700
Someone's...

2433
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,020
Is it?

2434
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,980
There's a...

2435
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,820
There's a...

2436
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,540
There's a monitor man.

2437
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,120
Oh, hey!

2438
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,040
TV head.

2439
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,380
Oh, I'm a TV head.

2440
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,200
I don't think he...

2441
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:49,860
Oh, he's friendly?

2442
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,280
Oh, chat wants to...

2443
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,340
An orange to replace...

2444
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,180
Oh, he wants an orange!

2445
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:53,660
Oh, nice!

2446
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:55,460
Oh...

2447
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,120
Uh...

2448
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,660
Orange?

2449
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,500
Signals on...

2450
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,380
The brightness of the monitors need to be changed.

2451
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:02,800
Okay.

2452
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,200
Don't make chat angry.

2453
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,540
We gotta get rid of the black liquid.

2454
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,480
Why are they sending you here?

2455
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,680
I saw a monitor.

2456
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,460
I picked one up.

2457
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,020
They said we gotta, like, make it match.

2458
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:20,780
Hmm.

2459
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,460
Does anybody else have a monitor?

2460
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,680
What?

2461
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:26,580
Uh...

2462
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,200
No, I don't have another one.

2463
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,380
I saw one.

2464
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,200
Um...

2465
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,580
In another room where we hid.

2466
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,600
Oh, yeah!

2467
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,640
I remember that, yeah.

2468
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,420
It's, like, right over here.

2469
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,980
My sandwich is too peanut buttery.

2470
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,320
Right here.

2471
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,320
Will this work?

2472
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,300
Yeah.

2473
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,380
Maybe?

2474
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:49,660
See?

2475
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,800
Oh, I think this is the lick.

2476
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,680
This is the goo.

2477
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,440
I think.

2478
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,740
Yeah, we have to remove it.

2479
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,180
The fact that you can see the monsters, like, climbing around outside is pretty freaky.

2480
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,260
Netherboard.

2481
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:09,560
Oh.

2482
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,480
I'm lost.

2483
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,010
Um...

2484
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,050
Is this what you want, sir?

2485
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:20,390
Fairly.

2486
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:21,390
How do I...

2487
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:23,470
Wait.

2488
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:24,810
What do I do with my flashlight?

2489
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,910
What else have to do next?

2490
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,730
Wait, did you place a monitor?

2491
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,790
I'm strong.

2492
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,210
I didn't have a monitor.

2493
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:33,370
I have a monitor?

2494
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:34,730
Wait, where do I place it?

2495
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,630
Right here.

2496
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:35,970
Right here.

2497
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,450
Okay.

2498
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:41,510
Maybe there's the cat.

2499
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,070
Oh, gosh.

2500
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,790
I dropped it for the monitor.

2501
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:45,890
Wait, isn't that?

2502
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:46,370
There he is.

2503
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:48,130
Yeah, yeah.

2504
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,830
There's also an evil centipede.

2505
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,750
It's coming our way.

2506
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:51,270
It's okay.

2507
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,670
It's okay.

2508
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,930
It's like a little rat.

2509
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,530
Oh, guys, I don't think this monitor match.

2510
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:03,970
Are you sure?

2511
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,110
I think it's fine.

2512
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:05,670
Yeah.

2513
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:05,730
Yeah.

2514
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,290
I'm gonna go get my flash...

2515
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,070
Wait, I can get another flashlight here, right?

2516
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:12,090
A wall of flashlight this way.

2517
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,750
There is like a house somewhere.

2518
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,430
But follow me, guys.

2519
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:19,890
There's a hole with a monster.

2520
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,930
A hole with a monster.

2521
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:22,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2522
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,430
Wait, what's this?

2523
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:25,750
Green electrical.

2524
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,250
Electrical.

2525
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,570
Oh, um...

2526
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,670
There was a red line like a...

2527
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:31,570
Oh, okay.

2528
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,150
Can we just put it...

2529
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,130
Can we just put this in here?

2530
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,090
Oh, we can't.

2531
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:39,630
No, that's the trading machine.

2532
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,210
Okay, so...

2533
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:41,370
Yeah.

2534
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:42,990
We have to hold on to this then.

2535
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,810
Okay, I found like...

2536
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:46,370
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2537
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,090
Follow me, guys.

2538
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,310
There's a little hole...

2539
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:49,230
With a...

2540
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:49,970
With a monster.

2541
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,630
I have nothing in my hand.

2542
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:52,050
I'm serious.

2543
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:55,270
I'm gonna check the red line.

2544
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:56,370
Okay.

2545
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,070
Did you just sit?

2546
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,470
Why are you so scared?

2547
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,730
You sat down.

2548
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:26,130
Don't look at the goo monster.

2549
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:28,090
I'm okay.

2550
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,830
I need a moment.

2551
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,410
Oh, nice.

2552
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,690
Oh, nice.

2553
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:38,490
We gotta go revive...

2554
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,110
Doobie.

2555
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:50,820
Whoa!

2556
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,040
Oh, there's a puzzle!

2557
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,820
We're gonna get a gun...

2558
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,360
Once we figure this out.

2559
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:58,920
Hurry...

2560
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,780
Silent Hill...

2561
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:00,920
Wait, wait.

2562
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,220
Doki!

2563
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:04,580
Yeah?

2564
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:05,780
Come...

2565
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,660
We revive Doobie.

2566
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,120
There we go.

2567
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:08,660
Hello!

2568
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:09,380
Hello!

2569
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,120
Alright, we gotta do this.

2570
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,280
Oh...

2571
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,200
One, two, three, four, five.

2572
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:17,940
I got the left side.

2573
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh...

2574
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,300
What do you mean?

2575
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:20,780
What is it?

2576
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,160
Is it the computers?

2577
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,600
Yeah, if you turn one off...

2578
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,420
Some of them turn...

2579
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:26,480
No!

2580
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,720
I got the left side.

2581
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,820
You meant to do the right.

2582
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,280
Yeah.

2583
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,120
Oh, this is the gray.

2584
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:35,500
Got it!

2585
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:36,460
What?

2586
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:36,940
Oh...

2587
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,320
We do?

2588
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:38,980
Oh...

2589
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:39,920
No...

2590
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,520
Oh...

2591
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,300
Oh...

2592
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,320
Great, great...

2593
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:43,800
Wait...

2594
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,680
Isn't that not gray?

2595
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,840
Oh wait...

2596
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,700
No, this has to be white.

2597
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,040
Oh...

2598
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,960
What if I do this?

2599
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,960
This is...

2600
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,160
Oh...

2601
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,380
Oh...

2602
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,460
I thought they were all supposed to be...

2603
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,020
Oh...

2604
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,120
It's different colors.

2605
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,020
Oh, it's like...

2606
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:56,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2607
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,160
Oh...

2608
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,440
And then this should be black.

2609
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,240
This guy's funny looking.

2610
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,140
And then...

2611
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:03,320
Hello.

2612
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,920
Hint to the puzzle.

2613
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,060
Oh, he'll give us a hint.

2614
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,920
Oh, nice.

2615
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:08,860
What's he saying?

2616
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,420
Oh...

2617
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:09,820
Wait, what?

2618
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,720
I think...

2619
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,660
Oh gosh...

2620
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,500
You need to...

2621
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,520
Make the...

2622
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:17,540
Signals...

2623
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,020
Oh...

2624
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:18,880
Oh...

2625
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:19,820
Okay.

2626
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,260
They're like...

2627
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,140
You just got matching.

2628
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,560
Wait a minute.

2629
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,300
Good hint, guys.

2630
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,880
Follow the line!

2631
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,780
Each line corresponds to a square!

2632
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,590
Did you solve the puzzle?

2633
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:36,110
This one?

2634
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:36,610
I was gonna make...

2635
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,470
I was gonna see if she was...

2636
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,790
Alive.

2637
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,880
What's down here?

2638
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,490
This is the ghoul, right?

2639
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:54,730
Yeah.

2640
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:55,670
No!

2641
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,270
This is the nether portal?

2642
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:00,710
Is there anything...

2643
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,350
There was this slot here, but...

2644
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,170
Oh, nice!

2645
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:04,570
Must not be the first one.

2646
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,470
I hear something, like...

2647
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,810
Whispering.

2648
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,050
Hmm...

2649
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:13,050
Oh, there's a hole!

2650
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:14,170
There's a hole here!

2651
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,380
Huh...

2652
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:22,130
I guess if you need to loop the monster...

2653
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:24,920
Oh...

2654
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,240
Probably...

2655
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:29,950
Hmm...

2656
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:30,570
Hmm...

2657
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,280
Someone's sounding like...

2658
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,040
Spongebob...

2659
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:39,560
Squarepants...

2660
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:40,520
Around here.

2661
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:41,940
You're right!

2662
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,580
Oh, we got...

2663
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,780
We got GooGuy again.

2664
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:49,400
Yeah.

2665
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,980
Oh, can we...

2666
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:52,960
Get out this window?

2667
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,780
It's open.

2668
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,520
I feel like we can't jump.

2669
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:58,680
Yeah.

2670
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,520
Yeah, we can't...

2671
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,020
Oh, sorry.

2672
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,480
Oh, bad.

2673
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,140
This one, too.

2674
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,180
Oh, there you go.

2675
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:11,840
Wait!

2676
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,660
I see!

2677
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,120
I see out here!

2678
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,180
Look, Nemi, Nemi!

2679
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,020
There's...

2680
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,640
There's another electrical thing out there.

2681
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,080
Yeah!

2682
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:19,780
Yeah!

2683
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:22,880
Interesting...

2684
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,000
I don't know...

2685
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,240
Interesting...

2686
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,460
We did it!

2687
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,180
Yay!

2688
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:31,560
Can we save?

2689
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,540
Let's save, let's save.

2690
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:33,820
Oh, yeah, let's save, let's save.

2691
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:35,800
Easy.

2692
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:36,640
Save.

2693
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,680
Yeah, we're the smart blondes.

2694
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,880
Yeah, what are you guys doing, huh?

2695
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,980
Where'd you guys go?

2696
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,740
Yeah, we were getting map awareness.

2697
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:48,620
Yeah, we were getting map awareness.

2698
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,780
We found an electrical box.

2699
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,600
I heard you giggle.

2700
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:52,900
Yeah, I heard you giggle.

2701
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,320
That's right!

2702
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:53,900
Work!

2703
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,660
Shoot the...

2704
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,800
Shoot the ink blobs.

2705
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,420
I heard you giggling through the wall.

2706
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,200
Shoot Inky.

2707
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,220
Nah, they don't...

2708
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:01,920
They can't be shot.

2709
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,220
Oh.

2710
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,160
Maybe they're tamed.

2711
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,540
They're, like, domesticated.

2712
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,100
Oh, yeah.

2713
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,340
Domesticated chat.

2714
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,580
They're well behaved now.

2715
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,720
Look, look out here.

2716
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,920
There's an electrical box on the rooftop there.

2717
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,320
Oh.

2718
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,240
We gotta find a way to get it.

2719
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:18,440
Oh, yeah, okay.

2720
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,580
No, I know how to get there.

2721
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,040
I know how to get there.

2722
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,140
I know how to get there.

2723
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:20,840
But I wanna...

2724
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:21,940
Shoot the shadows first.

2725
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:22,980
Okay.

2726
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2727
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:25,840
It's over here.

2728
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,060
It's a lot scary when there's, like...

2729
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,060
You know...

2730
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,280
When there's light.

2731
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,120
Yeah!

2732
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,480
Oh, wow!

2733
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,280
That actually worked!

2734
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,860
Okay, but here...

2735
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,640
Just follow me.

2736
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,600
There's, like, another...

2737
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:38,880
Look.

2738
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:39,940
Follow me.

2739
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:40,600
Yeah, yeah.

2740
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,540
Wait, did you get the goo?

2741
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2742
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,660
Come here.

2743
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,260
This goes into the classroom.

2744
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,200
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2745
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:47,980
Here, here, here.

2746
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:48,980
This guy.

2747
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:49,720
This guy.

2748
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,720
There's something evil out there.

2749
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:52,460
Oh.

2750
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,700
I can't shoot him.

2751
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:56,760
Did that work?

2752
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:57,840
No.

2753
01:25:58,940 --> 01:25:59,700
I think it's for...

2754
01:25:59,700 --> 01:25:59,860
I don't know what...

2755
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh.

2756
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,160
It's just for the wall, right?

2757
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:01,840
I think so.

2758
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,960
I don't know what this is for, though.

2759
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:03,660
There he goes.

2760
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,440
It's for the wall.

2761
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,360
Didn't we get the wall?

2762
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,080
Yeah, no, no, the wall.

2763
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:13,960
No, that's not the wall.

2764
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,340
The wall's behind us.

2765
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:16,540
Go!

2766
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,400
Alright, well, let's go back then.

2767
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,140
Yeah, we're back.

2768
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,120
We have a wall to explore.

2769
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,880
We've got a wall.

2770
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:26,640
Yeah.

2771
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,120
We've got a wall to explore.

2772
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:32,120
Yeah, yeah.

2773
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,060
We'll do that.

2774
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:33,840
We'll do that for it.

2775
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,180
Ah!

2776
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:34,680
Ah!

2777
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,660
Ah!

2778
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:38,600
Oh.

2779
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,500
Okay, so that's...

2780
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,140
Meet the monster on...

2781
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:42,680
Ah!

2782
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:52,110
I think they met the monster.

2783
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:53,390
I think they met the monster.

2784
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:54,670
Ah ha ha.

2785
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,070
I met the monster.

2786
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:59,330
Also, was there a Samurai?

2787
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,030
If so, thank you so much!

2788
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:08,430
Oh my god, are we safe?

2789
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:09,290
Are we safe?

2790
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,330
Are we safe?

2791
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:10,850
Are we safe?

2792
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,950
Are we safe?

2793
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,250
I'm coming back!

2794
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:19,440
I'm coming back!

2795
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,220
Green girls, go together.

2796
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,340
I don't think you can come in here, right?

2797
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,220
I think he's too sick.

2798
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,720
Oh, close the door.

2799
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,960
I don't think...

2800
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,300
Hello?

2801
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,420
Are we safe?

2802
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:34,580
Are we safe?

2803
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,680
I don't know if we need to be safe.

2804
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,320
I don't think so.

2805
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,220
I know she's dead, dead.

2806
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,440
I saw them both get run over, like they both got hit with a bus.

2807
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,920
Oh, okay, so we have to like run past it when he...

2808
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,180
Yeah.

2809
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,020
I don't remember where the wall...

2810
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,820
Oh, there's a door here.

2811
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2812
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:58,960
Oh.

2813
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,400
He's so loud!

2814
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,400
He really does sound like a boss.

2815
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,720
Okay, when he does the loop, we run.

2816
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:10,460
Oh!

2817
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,300
Let me!

2818
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,780
We have to wait for him to do the loop.

2819
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,020
I heard her for a split second.

2820
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,140
She's like an angel.

2821
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,320
Go, go, go, go!

2822
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:23,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2823
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,970
Go, go, go, go, go!

2824
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:34,110
Oh, yeah, you're safe in there, you're safe in there.

2825
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:35,170
An alarm clock.

2826
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:37,130
Um...

2827
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:37,450
Doobie?

2828
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:38,670
Doobie is still alive.

2829
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:40,230
Doobie?

2830
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:40,450
Doobie, though?

2831
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,150
It really is like a train.

2832
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:48,950
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo!

2833
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,750
The train...

2834
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,150
is departing.

2835
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:55,850
Kinda cute.

2836
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,190
Wait...

2837
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,200
How did Doki die?!

2838
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,610
Oh god, I'm not gonna make it.

2839
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,610
Doki, how did you die?!

2840
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:09,610
I don't know why I can't ever hear anybody when I'm dead.

2841
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:13,810
I... I can't...

2842
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,570
How did Doki die?

2843
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:17,630
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

2844
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:21,370
It's a peanut butter banana sandwich.

2845
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,460
I wonder if this is useful.

2846
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,220
Oh, it's so much peanut butter.

2847
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,140
Hello?

2848
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,520
Is that a spirit box?

2849
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:44,600
Hey!

2850
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,060
That's my radio!

2851
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,100
Is everybody dead?

2852
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,240
Oh yeah, she can revive us.

2853
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,460
Oh, she's back!

2854
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,120
Yeah!

2855
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,300
Hello!

2856
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:58,580
Yeah!

2857
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,540
Okay, so...

2858
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:01,700
Um...

2859
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,840
Um, so...

2860
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,270
He turns around.

2861
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,030
He does?

2862
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:07,470
He turns around.

2863
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:10,710
Yeah, so we have to let him walk, run a little bit, and then...

2864
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,290
Uh...

2865
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:12,070
Oh, you can have the gun.

2866
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:13,170
Nah, it's okay.

2867
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,210
Alright, and then like...

2868
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,050
And then run.

2869
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:17,930
So I was wondering how you died.

2870
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,610
I tapped the doobie for two seconds.

2871
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,050
Yeah.

2872
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:20,850
I know, me too!

2873
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:21,670
I missed...

2874
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,490
He turns around.

2875
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:24,150
I think we can run from here, right?

2876
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:25,490
Maybe?

2877
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:27,590
I just wait until he turns the corner.

2878
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,670
Yeah.

2879
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:29,570
Yeah.

2880
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,330
Why is he so loud?

2881
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:36,810
Go, go, go.

2882
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:38,050
Run, run, run.

2883
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:39,170
We're all gonna get...

2884
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:39,770
Run, run, run, run!

2885
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,370
Get the door!

2886
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:42,830
Get the door!

2887
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,690
Go, go, go!

2888
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:45,510
I got the door, I got the door, I got the door, I got the door.

2889
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,930
We're safe here, we're safe here.

2890
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,390
Doobie?

2891
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:49,070
Where's Doobie?

2892
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:13,650
Where's Doobie?

2893
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:15,730
Oh yeah, oh wait, you're right.

2894
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:19,030
No, I think that's probably an easier way to get the... Wait.

2895
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,250
Doki, come back.

2896
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,810
Doki, come shoot the goo.

2897
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,670
Come shoot the goo.

2898
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:24,850
Wait, where?

2899
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:26,470
It's uh... What the?

2900
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:27,890
Right here.

2901
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,010
Right here, right here.

2902
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:31,790
Oh.

2903
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:32,650
Oh.

2904
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,370
Watch out!

2905
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,530
I don't see a goo anywhere.

2906
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,230
No, no, no.

2907
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:37,770
What's there?

2908
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,430
Out here, out here, out here.

2909
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:40,210
Oh.

2910
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:42,570
Wait, wait, wait.

2911
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:43,070
Doki?

2912
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:43,190
Me?

2913
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:44,470
Wait, behind you.

2914
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:45,150
There you go.

2915
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,230
Oh, through the window.

2916
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:47,850
Oh.

2917
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,050
Through the window.

2918
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:49,870
To the wall.

2919
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:50,810
To the wall.

2920
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,420
Okay, it's just me.

2921
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,580
I got this.

2922
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:01,980
Maybe.

2923
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:03,340
Maybe I don't.

2924
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,280
If I die... I've been dead.

2925
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,680
I don't like it the way it breathes.

2926
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:10,520
It's so scary.

2927
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,060
That's what it sounds like.

2928
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,900
It's huffing and puffing.

2929
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,260
If you're so tired, stop running.

2930
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,220
Bozo?

2931
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,360
Gosh.

2932
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:23,860
Please leave me alone.

2933
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,560
Please.

2934
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:26,780
Oh,

2935
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:33,350
you got it?

2936
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,190
Yeah, I got it.

2937
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:36,030
I got it.

2938
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:38,010
Vince found the... Oh.

2939
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:38,890
Oh.

2940
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:40,330
Ah.

2941
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,600
He's

2942
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:07,490
gonna...

2943
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:12,030
I saw... I saw Nimi dying to the... to the... to the... to the... to the...

2944
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:13,290
Slender Man.

2945
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,330
So I ran back inside.

2946
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:17,670
The timing was bad.

2947
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,520
I made it.

2948
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,680
I got it!

2949
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,720
Okay!

2950
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,540
Okay, we got the door!

2951
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,220
Okay!

2952
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:44,300
You got the windows?

2953
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,320
Careful, don't get run over!

2954
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,000
I'm not!

2955
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:48,360
I'm not!

2956
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,040
We wait here!

2957
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:52,680
Okay.

2958
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:52,720
Okay?

2959
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,700
I'm running.

2960
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,060
I'm running.

2961
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:57,440
I'm running.

2962
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:57,800
I'm running.

2963
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,180
I'm running.

2964
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,460
I'm running.

2965
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,240
I sound just like that thing.

2966
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,120
Can I fall off the roof, you think?

2967
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:28,920
A brain.

2968
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,340
We need two more.

2969
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:39,670
There's probably one over there.

2970
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:46,070
Yeah, we should go back and save.

2971
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:48,050
What's in here?

2972
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:50,370
Is there anything in here?

2973
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,220
Gosh, why is this so nerve-wracking?

2974
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,600
Oh, there was one in here, I guess.

2975
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,200
It's the heavy breathing.

2976
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:00,040
I know, he's scary.

2977
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,600
Like, stop running if you're so tired.

2978
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,260
Yeah, stupid.

2979
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,800
Doki, where'd you go?

2980
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,640
I'm on the other side.

2981
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,810
On the other side?

2982
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:17,490
You died?

2983
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,090
Ah, I can still hear her.

2984
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,640
It turned around on Doobie.

2985
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:47,950
I think we can go.

2986
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:49,310
Can we go?

2987
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:51,930
Uh-oh, it's too late.

2988
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:53,210
Wait, where?

2989
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,390
I think we're dead!

2990
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,630
I think we're dead!

2991
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:57,250
I'm dead!

2992
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,880
I didn't see the open door!

2993
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,620
Okay, maybe it's a good thing I died, huh?

2994
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:11,660
Yeah.

2995
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,400
This game is insane!

2996
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:28,340
Oh my gosh, it's only been an hour and a half!

2997
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,820
It feels like it's been, like...

2998
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,180
Like a year, we've been playing this game.

2999
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,680
Oh wait, when did Doki die?

3000
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:35,920
Okay!

3001
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:41,060
We should've gone back and saved, huh?

3002
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,200
We

3003
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,000
should've gone back and saved.

3004
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,340
Wait, does that mean she's dead?

3005
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,520
The gun is right there?

3006
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,660
I think so.

3007
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,060
I'm gonna turn the light on, yeah.

3008
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:07,460
Where's the save point?

3009
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,120
You remember, Nimi, you remember!

3010
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,600
Where's the save point?

3011
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,180
Remember who you are...

3012
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,360
And where the save point is...

3013
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,420
I can do this on my own!

3014
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,300
Yes, you can!

3015
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,940
She's so cute.

3016
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:29,790
Wait, what's in there?

3017
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:34,110
You did it!

3018
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:35,650
You did it!

3019
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:36,610
You did it!

3020
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:37,810
You did it!

3021
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:38,610
I became a hero!

3022
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,910
Where are we?

3023
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,950
Where is this?

3024
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:44,790
Where are we?

3025
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:45,670
Wait!

3026
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:46,990
How did you get here?

3027
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:48,390
Is that a green...

3028
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,690
No?

3029
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:53,130
Oh wait, I think this is where the...

3030
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:53,950
The guy...

3031
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,450
Crashed through the wall from.

3032
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:56,330
Oh!

3033
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:57,950
Okay, we're still...

3034
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:58,730
Oh, I found a circuit!

3035
01:37:58,830 --> 01:37:59,210
Guys, guys!

3036
01:37:59,270 --> 01:37:59,810
Oh, circuit!

3037
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,450
Nice, nice, nice!

3038
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3039
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:03,110
Alright, we need to find one more circuit area.

3040
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:07,250
Wait, it seems that monster that was hiding...

3041
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,190
In the building is lurking on...

3042
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:10,470
Oh...

3043
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:11,470
Now it's broken loose.

3044
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:12,410
I only have...

3045
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,070
I only have...

3046
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:14,810
I can't pick it up because I have guns.

3047
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:15,850
Oh, sorry!

3048
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,450
Oh!

3049
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,530
I got it!

3050
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:19,150
I got it!

3051
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:22,310
Alright...

3052
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,930
We have to figure out where this goes.

3053
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:25,730
Uh...

3054
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:26,370
The red line.

3055
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,930
Follow the red line.

3056
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:28,470
Uh...

3057
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:28,910
Wait...

3058
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:29,530
Are we going?

3059
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,750
I don't know, I'm scared to go!

3060
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:32,690
I'm scared too!

3061
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:38,470
This thing is so ugly!

3062
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:39,170
Go, go, go!

3063
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:42,890
It's safe here!

3064
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,670
Uh...

3065
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,090
Is it here?

3066
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,410
No, no, no.

3067
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:46,090
This is the door.

3068
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,190
Oh, okay, okay.

3069
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:48,350
So we have to find...

3070
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,750
Where to put the green.

3071
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,110
Okay.

3072
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:52,830
We have to make clear for a decision.

3073
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:53,550
Yeah.

3074
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,310
Okay, and then make sure he doesn't turn around.

3075
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:56,990
Turn around!

3076
01:38:58,190 --> 01:38:59,730
Yeah, we can turn around and fucking...

3077
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,130
Go, go, go!

3078
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:02,710
In here?

3079
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:03,930
Maybe.

3080
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:05,730
I don't think I saw one in here, but maybe.

3081
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:07,070
I mean, we can crouch here.

3082
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:08,030
Yeah, yeah.

3083
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:08,070
Yeah.

3084
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:13,650
There's no line in here.

3085
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:14,510
Come on.

3086
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:14,890
Yeah.

3087
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,410
Where the fuck is the line?

3088
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:17,970
Where's the line?

3089
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:19,990
There's a line here.

3090
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:20,110
Let me in.

3091
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:20,610
Let me in.

3092
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:21,530
He's going to turn around again.

3093
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:22,470
What?

3094
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:23,930
There's no line.

3095
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,970
I don't see a box here.

3096
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:25,670
I don't either.

3097
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:27,330
I don't even feel free.

3098
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:32,150
Oh wait.

3099
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,590
I should follow them.

3100
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,010
A w-A wait?

3101
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:39,530
A wait?

3102
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,330
A wait?

3103
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:41,350
Is dubio...

3104
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,290
Oh, I was wondering that too.

3105
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:45,010
Turn around!

3106
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:46,330
Actually, don't turn around.

3107
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:48,450
Okay.

3108
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,070
Oh my God, I thought he turned around for a second.

3109
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,720
What's that sound?

3110
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,220
Can we respawn them?

3111
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,060
Wait, what's...

3112
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,240
Where am I putting it?

3113
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,760
Oh, can I respawn do you?

3114
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,700
I know where the box is!

3115
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,130
Oh, there's more, there's more than one!

3116
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,620
I think, I remember that giant jumping thing all the way over there?

3117
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,260
Yeah, I think...

3118
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,080
I think that's where the last green box is.

3119
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:41,760
This probably is.

3120
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,920
Wait, let's save real quick, let's save real quick since we put it in the box.

3121
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,500
Okay, yeah, we just did that one, yeah.

3122
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:46,940
Yeah, yeah.

3123
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:48,780
Yeah, that's a good idea.

3124
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,360
Okay, alright.

3125
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:50,520
Alright.

3126
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,560
We're gonna see the mood, guys!

3127
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,260
We're gonna see the mood!

3128
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,600
The mood!

3129
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,060
Alright, we wait to a rocket.

3130
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,180
Alright!

3131
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,900
Oh my god, oh my god, we're gonna see this to a rocket.

3132
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,280
We're gonna go to space with our anime girlfriend.

3133
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:06,660
Yeah.

3134
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:07,940
We win!

3135
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:15,510
I'm gonna run to the safe spot.

3136
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:16,210
Safe point.

3137
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,650
Alright.

3138
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:18,130
Okay.

3139
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:19,250
I feel very safe in here.

3140
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:21,090
I'm gonna take the radio, then.

3141
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:22,410
Yeah.

3142
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:24,430
Put on some gas, doobie!

3143
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:26,830
What?!

3144
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:28,390
What?!

3145
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:29,930
Um...

3146
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,170
I think I died...

3147
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:33,690
How the hell did I die?!

3148
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,960
Because we're a team!

3149
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,480
We're right...

3150
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:42,900
Sorry!

3151
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,380
What did you do?

3152
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,380
What did you do?

3153
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:45,940
My kissy.

3154
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:46,760
We all ran out!

3155
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:50,580
We let him just turn around with all kinds of things!

3156
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,420
I think like, the collision of your bodies...

3157
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:56,340
Because I didn't go outside, I think it like ran into me.

3158
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:56,900
What did I do?

3159
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:57,380
What did I do?

3160
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,680
What did I do?

3161
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,540
Go, go, go, go, go!

3162
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:04,760
Go, go, go, go!

3163
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:06,060
Hahaha!

3164
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:07,560
Hahaha!

3165
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,280
Fucking lemons, yeah!

3166
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:10,760
The four for one sale!

3167
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:11,220
There you go.

3168
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:11,880
There we go.

3169
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:12,340
Okay.

3170
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,960
The four for one sale.

3171
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:15,860
Hahaha!

3172
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,480
Go, go, go!

3173
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,640
Go, go, go!

3174
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,160
Oh my gosh.

3175
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:21,960
Oh my gosh.

3176
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,200
We're gonna make it!

3177
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,680
We're gonna make it!

3178
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,240
We're gonna

3179
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,550
make it!

3180
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:37,670
Doobie!

3181
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:39,490
Doobie!

3182
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,490
I think we're way past 19.

3183
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:49,290
Okay, the last green circuit is here.

3184
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,170
It's got to be.

3185
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,270
Wait what if the radio is the key?

3186
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:55,710
I don't think the radio is...

3187
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:58,930
Where is the radio?

3188
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,690
Oh, wait, where's Doobie?

3189
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,590
He died because of the radio.

3190
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:09,230
What if the sound distracts it?

3191
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:10,570
Alright, do it.

3192
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:11,750
Oh, he ran away.

3193
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,570
Go off the way.

3194
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:18,290
Alright, I thought we should sit close together.

3195
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,230
It sounds like a cat.

3196
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:23,290
It sounds like that cat that's eating.

3197
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,870
I don't want to die again!

3198
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:29,950
I don't want to die!

3199
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:33,270
Alright, well we can't sit together because we got...

3200
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,000
I don't think he sees us.

3201
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:39,600
You're fine, he didn't see us.

3202
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,460
Be a hero.

3203
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,150
But where is it?

3204
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:59,160
He's gonna jump soon.

3205
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,060
I know, but I don't know where...

3206
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,320
It's fine, we're fine here.

3207
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,720
Wait, wait we distracted for Nimi, we distracted for Nimi!

3208
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:19,440
Yeah, yeah.

3209
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,080
AHHH.

3210
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,200
We did not distract him.

3211
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,400
No, she's alive, she's alive!

3212
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,480
Yeah, she's alive, she's alive.

3213
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,060
Did she get it?

3214
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,060
She's a hero.

3215
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:39,960
She's a hero.

3216
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:55,500
Alright, let's go.

3217
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,800
Let's go before someone else dies.

3218
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:02,140
Watch the Slenderman come back and get one of us.

3219
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,780
Wait, no man, you hold it.

3220
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:07,960
But you know where it is.

3221
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:08,600
You know where it is.

3222
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,460
Okay, we gotta wait for the loop.

3223
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:10,220
We gotta wait for...

3224
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:31,290
Alive!

3225
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:43,940
Heroes!

3226
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:49,960
Oops.

3227
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:51,780
Oops.

3228
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,260
Uh, there we go.

3229
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,180
I'm gonna die.

3230
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,060
I made it!

3231
01:45:59,200 --> 01:45:59,860
I lived!

3232
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:00,920
Yeah,

3233
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:08,790
we should save again, for sure.

3234
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:09,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3235
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:12,510
Okay.

3236
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:14,390
There's a door.

3237
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:15,430
It's a loop right here.

3238
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:16,610
Oh, we should go this way then.

3239
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,490
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3240
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:18,810
It's on the other side.

3241
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:20,330
It's on the other side of the...

3242
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,190
Oh, wait.

3243
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,030
It's the door.

3244
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,250
We gotta go all the way down.

3245
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:25,870
Yeah, that's right.

3246
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:27,690
Wait, where are they?

3247
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:29,230
I don't know.

3248
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:34,890
Go, go, go, go, go.

3249
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,130
Go, go, go, go.

3250
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,810
Where are we going?

3251
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:37,790
It's the left side.

3252
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:38,510
It's the left side.

3253
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:41,230
No, it's...it's...it is, but...

3254
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:42,890
We gotta go down this hallway first.

3255
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:44,090
Alright, I'll see it before.

3256
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:44,710
Oh.

3257
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:47,130
Hey, where are you guys?

3258
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:52,050
I'll be the first one there.

3259
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,090
There.

3260
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,510
Okay.

3261
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:56,730
It's like...

3262
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:57,230
Right here!

3263
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:57,810
It's right here!

3264
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:58,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3265
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,530
Oh, nice.

3266
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:01,630
Nice, alright.

3267
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:02,130
Woohoo!

3268
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,090
We did it!

3269
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,490
We did it!

3270
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,250
Yeah!

3271
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:08,790
We defeated the monster!

3272
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:10,730
Where's the moon?

3273
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:13,110
Wait, what's down here?

3274
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:15,090
Hello?

3275
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,430
Uh, close from the other side.

3276
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:18,730
Okay.

3277
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:19,930
Hi, mom.

3278
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:20,010
No.

3279
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:22,090
No, we can't open that.

3280
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,770
No, no, no.

3281
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:23,750
Can we go down then?

3282
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:25,610
Down, down, down.

3283
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:28,050
Down, down, down.

3284
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,150
Oh, there's another one here.

3285
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:30,230
River!

3286
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:35,370
Dynamite?

3287
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:37,130
Ooh.

3288
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,730
Any dynamite here?

3289
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,310
For that monster.

3290
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:43,430
I'm shooting my goo.

3291
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:45,610
That's right, shoot that white goo.

3292
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:46,970
Wait, yeah, we gotta place...

3293
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:47,410
Oh, elevator!

3294
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:50,470
Oh, there's a door!

3295
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:50,850
There's a door!

3296
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:50,950
There's a door!

3297
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:52,390
Where's a safe boy?

3298
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:54,690
It's your wife!

3299
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:55,570
It's your wife, Ben!

3300
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:56,090
Where?

3301
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,310
You made it!

3302
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:00,450
You made it!

3303
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,210
You made it!

3304
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:01,930
See, I...

3305
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:03,110
Are you heading to the board?

3306
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:03,710
Step back.

3307
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:04,950
I'm gonna...

3308
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:05,490
What does it say?

3309
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:06,670
I'm coming!

3310
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,950
Whoa!

3311
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:09,190
That's my woman!

3312
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:10,470
I couldn't help it!

3313
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,510
She's coming with us!

3314
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:15,430
She's coming with us!

3315
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:16,530
She's coming with us!

3316
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:18,770
She's so tall!

3317
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:24,530
You gotta impress her with your moves!

3318
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,010
I know.

3319
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,010
Oh, yeah, hold on.

3320
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:26,710
Let me show her.

3321
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:27,690
Come here.

3322
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:28,470
Wait, where's she going?

3323
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:29,310
You see that?

3324
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:29,630
Oh!

3325
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,390
Let's all dance around here.

3326
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:31,790
Yeah.

3327
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:33,490
Let me jump down the elevator chair.

3328
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:34,830
Oh, she's in here.

3329
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:36,910
Woo!

3330
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:37,410
Woo!

3331
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:39,890
Woo!

3332
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:41,590
Woo!

3333
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:44,890
Woo!

3334
01:48:45,850 --> 01:48:47,270
Which one is that?

3335
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:48,930
Wait!

3336
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,250
Wait!

3337
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:51,570
Wait!

3338
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:53,110
Do you think she likes it?

3339
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:59,010
I'm doing a robot here.

3340
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,750
That's not the robot.

3341
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:01,730
That is the Macarena.

3342
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:11,890
Someone has to press the elevator.

3343
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:13,270
Alright, next.

3344
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,110
Oh my god, her hair when we go down.

3345
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:16,510
Wow!

3346
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:20,520
This elevator is fast, guys.

3347
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,360
The fastest elevator ever, yeah.

3348
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:22,460
Yeah.

3349
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,040
Do we have to turn them?

3350
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,000
This looks like a fried house.

3351
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,640
Uh-oh.

3352
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,340
Um...

3353
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:29,940
There's some...

3354
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,320
There's some creepiness over there.

3355
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:31,860
Can you talk to her?

3356
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,720
Oh, she doesn't want to talk to us.

3357
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,160
She doesn't want to talk to you.

3358
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,520
Oh, okay.

3359
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,400
You talk to me.

3360
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,180
It's just a dead guy.

3361
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,460
No, but there's another guy.

3362
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,440
It looks like a clown.

3363
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:43,960
A clown?

3364
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,920
Are you afraid of clowns, man?

3365
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,380
Look at him.

3366
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,780
He's got really long arms.

3367
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:49,820
Where?

3368
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:51,300
Oh wait, there is a clown.

3369
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,900
Oh, it's...

3370
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:53,580
It's...

3371
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:53,720
Wait!

3372
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,100
Oh, he trapped him!

3373
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:56,200
They trapped him!

3374
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:56,860
Oh!

3375
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:57,660
Whoa.

3376
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,380
I didn't know this was that kind of dungeon.

3377
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:02,360
Yeah!

3378
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,420
Wait, wait.

3379
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,340
Uh-oh.

3380
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:08,240
Oh, it's his brother!

3381
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:09,240
Yeah!

3382
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,940
Dance number five on him!

3383
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,100
Dance number five on him!

3384
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:14,500
Dance number five on him!

3385
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,060
Dance number five.

3386
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,220
That's someone's brother!

3387
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,680
Let it rip!

3388
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,520
Someone's brother, yeah.

3389
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,780
I'm bro!

3390
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:30,680
Oh, no!

3391
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,240
What does the bro have to say?

3392
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,360
Nothing.

3393
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,420
He's a silent killer.

3394
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,780
There's a door over here.

3395
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:40,940
Whoa!

3396
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,020
Big room!

3397
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:42,100
Boom!

3398
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:43,980
Whoa!

3399
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:46,020
How long is this game?

3400
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:48,340
Will we ever see the moon?

3401
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,040
Oh, we're here?

3402
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:50,020
We're...

3403
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:50,120
Wait.

3404
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,520
She did kind of look like a banana.

3405
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:53,780
Yeah, but then the guy died.

3406
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:54,920
Oh.

3407
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,220
We had to go downstairs.

3408
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:57,680
We had to find...

3409
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:58,420
Maybe...

3410
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,300
A staircase?

3411
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:00,980
Oh!

3412
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:01,780
A scanner!

3413
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:02,960
Oh!

3414
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,220
Oh, nice!

3415
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:05,620
This guy!

3416
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:06,060
This guy!

3417
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:06,360
This guy!

3418
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:06,680
I just...

3419
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:07,580
Oh, I think that's him!

3420
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,280
Where are you guys?

3421
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:23,720
Oh.

3422
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,660
Why is she telling you, Juby?

3423
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:30,080
It's a...

3424
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,540
mandatory scam...

3425
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:35,980
You guys don't need to watch this, guys.

3426
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,160
You're the...

3427
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,420
You know, like the...

3428
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,340
We're the movie inspectors.

3429
01:51:45,110 --> 01:51:47,170
I'm just trying to see what the scan thing does.

3430
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:47,950
Oh.

3431
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:48,490
Wait!

3432
01:51:48,650 --> 01:51:50,930
Can I just push the third button on the elevator?

3433
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:51,510
Wait.

3434
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:52,830
Okay.

3435
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:54,710
Who forgot to push the other button?

3436
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:55,770
Who...

3437
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:57,950
Who forgot to push the third button?

3438
01:51:57,970 --> 01:52:00,550
I didn't realize there was a basement three.

3439
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,020
Oh!

3440
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:08,340
Whoops!

3441
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:08,700
Sorry.

3442
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:09,840
That was...

3443
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,500
Whoa!

3444
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,320
Whoa!

3445
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:23,220
Our guesses were correct!

3446
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,840
The moon is locked in here!

3447
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:25,940
Are we giant...

3448
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,760
We need to find a way to free it!

3449
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,020
We're in Bruce's laboratory, guys!

3450
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,560
We're in Bruce's laboratory!

3451
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,560
There's a cat down there.

3452
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:34,940
What's the cat?

3453
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,340
Oh, yeah!

3454
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:37,280
The cat's staring at the moon!

3455
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,320
What's that thing?

3456
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:40,080
Oh, is that our girl?

3457
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,400
Is that our girl right there?

3458
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,280
Oh, there she is!

3459
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:42,580
Yeah!

3460
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,600
Oh, there she is!

3461
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,580
Did you want to see the moon?

3462
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,000
I caught the moon for you!

3463
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,100
So this is the moon you are after?

3464
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:54,340
Cute, but kind of tiny, isn't it?

3465
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,580
Oh, it's not about the size.

3466
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,120
The worst she can say is no.

3467
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,140
Some people say it's above average, okay?

3468
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:07,240
Wait, do you guys see the little coronaviruses that are downstairs?

3469
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,180
What did she have?

3470
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:12,820
Did you see anything?

3471
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,520
Where?

3472
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,600
I

3473
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,540
can't do it, I can't do it again.

3474
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,240
I got my shot.

3475
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,280
I toggled it.

3476
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:44,020
Oh, something happened.

3477
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:47,880
I mean, I don't think it's dangerous right now.

3478
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:56,970
Okay.

3479
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:58,910
Okay, let's just explore.

3480
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:59,470
Yeah.

3481
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:06,530
Oh, yeah, TVs are coming on.

3482
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:07,790
Oh, yeah.

3483
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:09,570
I see it.

3484
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,850
There's no elevator here.

3485
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:16,370
You know how to use that thing?

3486
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:17,950
No, I don't.

3487
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,110
Call the elevator.

3488
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,350
No, it just shoots off in the mud.

3489
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:23,170
Look at it.

3490
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:24,930
Ooh, white liquid gun.

3491
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,930
I'm controlling it.

3492
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,770
Wait, you're controlling?

3493
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:28,630
Yeah.

3494
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,010
Oh, cool.

3495
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:31,170
Oh, cool.

3496
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,070
Is that all we do here?

3497
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:36,730
It's an elevator.

3498
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:38,190
Yeah.

3499
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:38,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3500
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:39,430
Can we go in?

3501
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:39,990
Is it?

3502
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:42,350
It says first, second, and third.

3503
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:43,390
Oh.

3504
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,150
Hmm.

3505
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:48,350
What else could we need around here?

3506
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:52,090
I got one of those.

3507
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,170
Don't say that.

3508
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:54,990
Oh, yeah.

3509
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,010
Electronic board.

3510
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,110
Zero out of two.

3511
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:00,670
We gotta get an electronic board.

3512
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:02,990
Oh, so we're going to the elevator.

3513
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:04,950
We're going to the elevator, yeah.

3514
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:05,430
Yeah.

3515
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,060
It's just shooting it on its own.

3516
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:13,560
Someone might need it.

3517
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,680
It's Bluetooth wireless.

3518
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:15,600
Oh.

3519
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,000
Wait, do we need it?

3520
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,860
Yeah, we might need it.

3521
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:18,360
I'll take it.

3522
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,680
Get out of here.

3523
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,480
I don't like it.

3524
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,740
Ew, I can't control it.

3525
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,520
I don't like it.

3526
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,280
No, I mean, Doobie's controlling it.

3527
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,120
I know, but it's in my hands.

3528
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:35,080
Okay, so dude, what floor do we do?

3529
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,220
We need electric boards is what it said.

3530
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,280
We need two of them.

3531
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:39,380
Okay.

3532
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,400
Is this an electric board?

3533
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:41,520
I think so.

3534
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,240
Is that it?

3535
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,520
It's a scanner.

3536
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:44,580
It's a board.

3537
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:45,280
Oh, look.

3538
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,160
Yeah, we're on a different floor, so...

3539
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:47,660
Oh, okay.

3540
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:50,060
Oh, this is where the monsters are.

3541
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:50,100
Wait.

3542
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,520
I think this is a save point, guys.

3543
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,100
Oh, nice.

3544
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:53,680
Finally.

3545
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:54,160
Save it.

3546
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,420
Okay, nice.

3547
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:57,060
There's something appearing on my radar.

3548
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:58,360
Oh.

3549
01:55:59,000 --> 01:55:59,400
Oh.

3550
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:00,060
Oh, no.

3551
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,060
Oh, maybe that finds the electric boards.

3552
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,620
Wait, maybe it's the moon.

3553
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:06,760
It's the moon.

3554
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:08,140
Oh, I see it.

3555
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:09,320
COVID's coming.

3556
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,180
COVID's coming.

3557
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:10,720
Oh.

3558
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:12,420
Wait, wait.

3559
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,480
War 2019.

3560
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,580
Tell them COVID's coming.

3561
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:20,580
Can I shoot it?

3562
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:22,880
Oh.

3563
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:24,080
My aim.

3564
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,080
Oops.

3565
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,080
A little down.

3566
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,340
Were you able to shoot your waiku on it?

3567
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,220
I'm trying to.

3568
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,580
I have performance anxiety.

3569
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,220
Or we go forward.

3570
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,720
Wait, there's something over here.

3571
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:45,400
Is that...

3572
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,440
I just toggled something.

3573
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,260
I don't know what happened, but...

3574
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:49,000
Oh, I found a...

3575
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,660
Oh, I found a lever!

3576
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:50,420
Oh, wait.

3577
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,780
I think we have to do it at the same time.

3578
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,860
The gate to the lower floor is locked by multiple levers.

3579
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:56,980
They must be activated simultaneously?

3580
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,300
What?

3581
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:01,920
Oh, no.

3582
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,980
Okay, I have a lever for one of them.

3583
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:09,580
Are there four levers?

3584
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:10,420
There's no way.

3585
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,370
But how would we...

3586
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,160
Wait.

3587
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,260
I guess they stay activated once you...

3588
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:19,640
You think they're lethal?

3589
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,120
They do everything like that.

3590
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:22,980
These things?

3591
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,500
Yeah.

3592
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:28,940
COVID.

3593
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,100
Oh, no.

3594
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,300
Wait, there's little...

3595
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:33,300
Oh, they're little guys!

3596
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,500
They have little heads!

3597
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,680
What is that?

3598
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:39,000
Okay, it doesn't work.

3599
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:41,560
Look at them.

3600
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:45,780
They're walking.

3601
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:51,900
Mutation.

3602
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,140
Mutation.

3603
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:59,350
It wasn't me, guys.

3604
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:00,590
Oh, it was on purpose.

3605
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:03,170
So maybe I should find a lever and then I'll press the...

3606
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,830
Oh.

3607
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:05,230
Oh.

3608
01:58:06,970 --> 01:58:08,330
Did you make...

3609
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,570
Did you make it angry?

3610
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:10,890
Yeah.

3611
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:13,330
Wait, is there a lever over there or...?

3612
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:14,690
I have a lever.

3613
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:15,190
Yeah, there is.

3614
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:15,490
There is.

3615
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:16,610
Mimi's not a lever.

3616
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:17,210
Okay.

3617
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:17,910
Oh, okay.

3618
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:19,330
Then...

3619
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:21,890
You have that one and then I have probably the one upstairs.

3620
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:22,850
Right?

3621
01:58:22,850 --> 01:58:22,930
What?

3622
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:23,690
Oh.

3623
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:25,090
You have to go back?

3624
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:26,150
Wait,

3625
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:32,190
I'll shoot the gun.

3626
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:33,290
I'll shoot the gun when she...

3627
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,240
Don't press it yet.

3628
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:40,980
She said she'll shoot the gun when Nimi presses it.

3629
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:41,920
Oh, okay.

3630
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:45,780
You think...

3631
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:46,740
Not yet.

3632
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:48,500
Not yet.

3633
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:52,620
Um...

3634
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,120
Almost?

3635
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:56,200
You think the Bluetooth range fell off?

3636
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:57,940
Oh!

3637
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:58,720
Press it!

3638
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:01,860
Did it work?

3639
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,000
No.

3640
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,440
There must be another lever because I have this.

3641
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,920
Oh, remember there's the one upstairs.

3642
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,940
I think that someone has to go...

3643
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:11,040
Yeah, but...

3644
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,400
Does that have to...

3645
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:12,880
Also?

3646
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,520
Yeah, I think so.

3647
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:18,880
It didn't work!

3648
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,160
There's more levers!

3649
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,000
Nimi died!

3650
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,020
Yeah, I mean, he's dead.

3651
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:28,900
Oh.

3652
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:29,340
I think...

3653
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,480
I think he died.

3654
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,980
Well, let's just go back upstairs and we got it anyway.

3655
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,600
There's the same area here.

3656
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,320
Oh, oh, that's right.

3657
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:35,780
It's this...

3658
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:36,360
It's this floor.

3659
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:36,740
Just kidding.

3660
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:36,880
I think...

3661
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:38,780
Is Doobie dead?

3662
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:40,260
Oh!

3663
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:40,660
Yeah.

3664
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:41,120
Oh!

3665
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,860
We did turn on the lever.

3666
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:44,420
It didn't work.

3667
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,080
Yeah.

3668
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,060
Is there another lever down here?

3669
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:47,980
Because I do have...

3670
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,000
Uh...

3671
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:49,660
I do have an apple.

3672
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,340
Well, wait.

3673
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:52,260
Let's go check the third floor, too, then.

3674
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:53,840
Because it might be down there.

3675
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,800
I'll be in the coordinate, like, all four, though.

3676
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,960
Yeah, don't you need everyone to be in the elevator to use it?

3677
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:00,500
Yeah.

3678
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,100
Oh, yeah.

3679
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:01,720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3680
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:02,380
Oh.

3681
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3682
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,120
He's coming in this...

3683
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:07,460
Ahh!

3684
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:14,190
Ah, he's a little coward baby.

3685
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,310
Yeah.

3686
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:17,170
We got our shots.

3687
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:20,430
Yeah, we got our shots.

3688
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:21,250
Yeah.

3689
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:26,680
Scary.

3690
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,580
That was like we're animals.

3691
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:35,000
We got our... we got our flea shot.

3692
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:35,580
Yeah!

3693
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,020
Oh no!

3694
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:38,840
It went after Nimi!

3695
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:41,560
Uh-oh.

3696
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,300
Did she make it?

3697
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:44,520
I don't know.

3698
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,960
It's making that sound like...

3699
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,540
I think she's... Oh, she ran to the other side.

3700
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,000
Yeah.

3701
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:50,840
You made it!

3702
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,440
Let's just take the third floor then, for now.

3703
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:55,780
Yeah, let's go... Okay, I got four levers.

3704
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,320
Let's go down one more...

3705
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:01,320
I'm just gonna hold on to this lever then.

3706
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:02,620
Yeah.

3707
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,720
Well, I guess... Yeah, first floor.

3708
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,180
Hey!

3709
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:39,380
You guys, it works without everybody being in the elevator.

3710
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,640
Oh, that's good.

3711
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:41,080
Okay.

3712
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,520
Yeah, then we can pull all of them.

3713
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:45,940
Yeah, but how do we do the countdown?

3714
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,260
Time to split up, gang.

3715
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:50,160
Take a time, and then do it up when the clock...

3716
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:50,620
Oh!

3717
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:52,360
Let's get our alarm!

3718
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,160
Let's set up an alarm!

3719
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:53,880
Oh, yeah!

3720
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:56,900
What is that?

3721
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:57,740
What is this?

3722
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,160
Yeah, this is what I saw before...

3723
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:01,080
Oh, wait!

3724
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:01,640
She's a minion.

3725
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,920
It's a little guy!

3726
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:04,460
Oh, there you go!

3727
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,400
Oh, there's a broken lever!

3728
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:05,740
Here you go!

3729
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:07,460
Documentation for the crystal.

3730
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,560
The crystal made from an orange.

3731
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:14,920
It glows with a bright orange pattern and emits orange particles that gradually fade away.

3732
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:24,700
When the moon remains indoors for an extended period, a residual heavy influence accumulates at the bottom of the room, aiding the ripening of oranges.

3733
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:26,300
However, it can be lethal.

3734
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:27,280
Even in a protective suit.

3735
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:28,100
Wait, is this an orange?

3736
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:28,620
Orange!

3737
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,620
Oh, we gotta bring this to that guy!

3738
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:35,760
If you need to approach the area beneath the moon, please take the crystal with you and stay close to it.

3739
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:36,940
Okay, so you gotta take it.

3740
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:39,040
Ew!

3741
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:39,380
Ew!

3742
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,620
It's my hat.

3743
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:42,400
What do you do?

3744
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:44,420
Ew!

3745
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:45,140
Ew!

3746
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:45,580
I'll get him!

3747
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:46,620
This is an orange!

3748
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:51,120
Has the gun always been in this position when you hopped?

3749
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:53,800
Um...

3750
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,560
I don't know.

3751
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,600
He's just very excited.

3752
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:02,820
Alright, so we have on the left...

3753
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:03,160
How do we...

3754
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:04,660
Aren't we gonna do the countdown for this?

3755
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,440
Let's do it at 6 and 6.

3756
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:06,740
It shows a light.

3757
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,520
It shows a light when someone presses it.

3758
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,240
Oh, yeah!

3759
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:10,160
So we can just...

3760
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,300
Oh, see the light.

3761
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:11,760
Yeah, see it up!

3762
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3763
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,580
Okay, I call bottom floor.

3764
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:14,380
Okay.

3765
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:15,620
We have to go to the COVID one.

3766
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:17,480
And this will save us from COVID.

3767
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,560
Alright, I'll do the first one.

3768
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:19,420
I'll do the first one.

3769
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:20,060
Bye!

3770
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:20,400
Bye!

3771
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:25,480
Um...

3772
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,500
I could...

3773
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,800
I don't care which one I go to.

3774
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:30,020
Wait, how many are there?

3775
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:30,860
Do we even count?

3776
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:31,120
Two?

3777
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,660
Yeah, there's four.

3778
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,100
Oh, wait.

3779
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:34,660
Oh, I'll go to...

3780
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,740
You're gonna go to the top one?

3781
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:37,000
I could go to...

3782
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,160
Wait, there's two on this one.

3783
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,320
There's two?

3784
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:39,700
Yeah.

3785
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,420
Go to my girlfriend, then.

3786
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,180
Thank you.

3787
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:43,740
I'm gonna go test this, uh...

3788
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:44,040
Crystal.

3789
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:48,560
Okay.

3790
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:51,200
So brave, Doki.

3791
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:54,020
It did say that it's lethal, so I hope she doesn't die.

3792
02:03:58,260 --> 02:03:59,700
Oh, she's already pulled it.

3793
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:04,220
I thought I heard something.

3794
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:06,640
It's so scary.

3795
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,980
What am I...

3796
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:08,840
What am I...

3797
02:04:20,410 --> 02:04:20,670
Oh.

3798
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:28,230
Alright, we're all...

3799
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:28,710
We're all good.

3800
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:29,170
Okay.

3801
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:30,190
Pull!

3802
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:40,940
Oh, I see the crystals.

3803
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,160
Uh...

3804
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,620
What is that?

3805
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:46,020
Maybe not good.

3806
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:57,090
Call the element.

3807
02:05:08,150 --> 02:05:08,790
Okay.

3808
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:09,390
Okay.

3809
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:09,830
No problem.

3810
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:11,770
I'm...

3811
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:12,310
I'm waiting.

3812
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:20,120
Why is she screaming?

3813
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:22,140
There we go.

3814
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:24,200
La, la, la, la.

3815
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3816
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:29,570
Bah.

3817
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:39,910
Maybe we should've gone and saved bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah.

3818
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:49,070
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah.

3819
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:54,890
Goin' to the first floor.

3820
02:05:56,650 --> 02:05:57,570
Ah, man.

3821
02:05:57,850 --> 02:05:58,550
Let's go.

3822
02:05:59,010 --> 02:05:59,930
Stay in the orange.

3823
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:00,670
Stay in the orange.

3824
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:01,150
Okay.

3825
02:06:01,330 --> 02:06:01,830
Or we die.

3826
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:03,250
We're going this way.

3827
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:04,590
There's a cat.

3828
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:05,150
There's a cat.

3829
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:06,710
There's a cat.

3830
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:08,050
He's so cute.

3831
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:09,210
Yeah.

3832
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:12,070
What's this?

3833
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:13,530
What is that?

3834
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:14,550
Electronic.

3835
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:16,130
Oh, one of the boards we need.

3836
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:16,370
It's a motherboard.

3837
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:16,930
Okay.

3838
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:17,590
Oh, nice.

3839
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:19,830
Relax.

3840
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:20,670
Run, run.

3841
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:20,710
What?

3842
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:33,530
Yeah, you guys got to get the board again.

3843
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:34,710
Someone dies to the moon.

3844
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,210
I heard the boom sound.

3845
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:38,730
Yeah, I'm over there.

3846
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:40,190
Can you not see me?

3847
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:43,610
I hope this... We got to find a save.

3848
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:45,050
I'm pretty sure it has to be.

3849
02:06:45,310 --> 02:06:46,530
The save is on the second floor.

3850
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:47,230
Oh, Easter egg.

3851
02:06:47,890 --> 02:06:48,430
There's an egg.

3852
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:50,150
There's an Easter... Oh, no.

3853
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:50,930
There's another one.

3854
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:52,430
Wait.

3855
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:54,690
Oh, there's more.

3856
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:55,630
I died.

3857
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:57,430
Vine boom.

3858
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:01,190
The vine... Not the vine boom.

3859
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:01,990
What is this?

3860
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:02,770
Wait.

3861
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:03,630
What is this?

3862
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:05,350
What is this?

3863
02:07:07,570 --> 02:07:08,150
Uh-oh.

3864
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:10,010
Oh, they're gathering?

3865
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:11,150
There's three of them now.

3866
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:11,510
There's three.

3867
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:12,610
One for each of us.

3868
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:12,970
Uh-oh.

3869
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:14,150
Doki about to die.

3870
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:15,570
The moon virus.

3871
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:17,890
The moon virus.

3872
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:18,610
Oh, no.

3873
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:19,670
They're going to take our bodies.

3874
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:23,390
You're going to get... What if it's... What if it's like... We got to find a save before they kill us.

3875
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:24,670
It's the stench aura.

3876
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:25,290
Yeah.

3877
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:27,190
I wonder if it's up the stairs.

3878
02:07:27,190 --> 02:07:27,990
It's all stairs.

3879
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,370
Oh, yeah.

3880
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:29,370
Let's go up the stairs.

3881
02:07:29,590 --> 02:07:29,690
Yeah.

3882
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:32,850
The aura.

3883
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:33,330
Okay.

3884
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:38,490
I don't think they can go upstairs.

3885
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:39,990
I don't think so, too.

3886
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:40,950
They don't have to lose.

3887
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:42,310
Oh, there's the same.

3888
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:43,470
Oh, Nez.

3889
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:44,970
Bring me home.

3890
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:45,550
Let's go.

3891
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:46,870
I'm home.

3892
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:48,910
Oh, they can go up the stairs.

3893
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:49,650
Oh, man.

3894
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,030
So what happened?

3895
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:51,570
The moon virus got you?

3896
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:53,550
Yeah, I got got by the moon virus.

3897
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:02,150
At least we saved.

3898
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:06,110
We're getting... We're getting killed by an inflatable man.

3899
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:13,650
We're going to die by the... Oh, the moon virus... The moon virus has infected us here.

3900
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:14,610
Oh.

3901
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:16,550
Well, that would have been great to know.

3902
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:22,330
Us green girls, we got... Look at the alien.

3903
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:26,090
The fully red, orange, as far as the new healer should take hold of it.

3904
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:27,890
What the... What's that?

3905
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:31,010
It's a little... It's the alien from... From Mexico.

3906
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:32,410
Hello.

3907
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:33,530
Hello, chat.

3908
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:35,930
Hello?

3909
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,950
Is he still chasing you?

3910
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,150
Oh.

3911
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:46,590
Welcome back, everyone.

3912
02:08:46,910 --> 02:08:47,110
Hello.

3913
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:47,710
Oh, no.

3914
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:49,210
No, no, no, no.

3915
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:52,880
What is this?

3916
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,480
Place for capsule.

3917
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:56,300
We got to get the capsule in.

3918
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:03,360
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,

3919
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,020

3920
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:18,740
nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope Push it down there.

3921
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,640
Push it with all my strength.

3922
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,760
Right there, right there, right there.

3923
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:27,040
There.

3924
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:29,000
Okay, we gotta push the other one.

3925
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:30,020
We gotta push the other one.

3926
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,320
It was over on the other side.

3927
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,440
I remember.

3928
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:37,760
Wait, wait, let's all get Doobie back guys!

3929
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:38,340
Guys, guys.

3930
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:38,940
Doobie!

3931
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,880
Yeah, yeah.

3932
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:40,420
Get Doobie back.

3933
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:41,620
Doobie!

3934
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:42,000
Hello!

3935
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:43,260
Welcome back Doobie!

3936
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:43,720
Welcome back!

3937
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:46,220
There's also a capsule downstairs, but I don't know.

3938
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,260
I think that's probably it.

3939
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,780
I don't think we can all land the stairs.

3940
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,560
No, yeah, we can push this one.

3941
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:58,020
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

3942
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:00,140
He's right there, he's right there, he's right there!

3943
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:04,960
Run for your lives!

3944
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:06,580
Oh, shoot.

3945
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,300
The squeaky, oh gosh, he's covered in PVC.

3946
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,540
He's covered in latex.

3947
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,540
This is sexy!

3948
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,200
I do not consent.

3949
02:10:23,210 --> 02:10:24,070
Is everyone dead?

3950
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:25,150
Hello, oh.

3951
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:27,210
Oh, I just watched Nimi die.

3952
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:28,550
Yeah, let's rez him.

3953
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:30,330
Hello.

3954
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:31,870
You're almost pulling back.

3955
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:36,590
Oh, shoot, I need to...

3956
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,590
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

3957
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:37,990
Oh, God.

3958
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:38,490
Wait.

3959
02:10:39,390 --> 02:10:39,810
Oops.

3960
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:41,830
I'm gonna die!

3961
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:42,030
Die!

3962
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:53,370
I forgot that we need the orb to go downstairs.

3963
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:55,930
So that's Doobie's job.

3964
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:57,030
Thank you, everybody's there.

3965
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,870
Yeah, we are.

3966
02:10:59,390 --> 02:10:59,810
Yeah,

3967
02:11:03,690 --> 02:11:18,770
we are.

3968
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:20,550
Doobie has to push it up all the way here.

3969
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:21,450
Yeah, I know.

3970
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:23,290
That's a lot.

3971
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:25,270
Hopefully she...

3972
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:27,890
Wait, if she dies, the orb stays down there.

3973
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:30,010
No, no, there's a train here.

3974
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:31,710
Oh, okay, just kidding.

3975
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:32,190
There's a...

3976
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:33,510
There's a guy behind him, he's behind him.

3977
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:33,850
Run!

3978
02:11:34,150 --> 02:11:34,370
Run!

3979
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:34,890
Go ahead!

3980
02:11:35,610 --> 02:11:36,490
Latex man!

3981
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:38,270
Bondage guy!

3982
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:41,190
It's the invisible man from the movie.

3983
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:43,610
Do you hear, like, how squeaky he is?

3984
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:44,750
Yeah, he is.

3985
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:46,930
It's the invisible man.

3986
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:48,010
Invisible...

3987
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:48,950
Oh, look at Doobie.

3988
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:49,890
Do you see Doobie?

3989
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:52,650
Look at her go, inching her way up.

3990
02:11:53,170 --> 02:11:54,110
With the little...

3991
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,290
With chat behind her.

3992
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:55,870
She's doing it.

3993
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:56,050
Run!

3994
02:11:57,310 --> 02:11:57,790
Run!

3995
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:57,930
Run!

3996
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:00,250
Let's distract him!

3997
02:12:00,850 --> 02:12:02,530
Oh yeah, that's true, we have to distract him.

3998
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:06,230
Oh my god, I think we're distracting him.

3999
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:08,070
Okay, let's hope Doobie is.

4000
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:08,810
Where is he?

4001
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:09,570
Just pushing him.

4002
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:12,790
Oh!

4003
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:13,490
Where is he?

4004
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:14,290
Oh, I see him.

4005
02:12:14,710 --> 02:12:15,710
I'm gonna go this way.

4006
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:17,410
He's right behind you.

4007
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:18,770
I don't see him.

4008
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:23,950
Where is he?

4009
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:24,510
I hear him.

4010
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,270
Oh, there he is!

4011
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,650
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4012
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:30,610
I hear his sexy suit.

4013
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:32,110
Oh, Doobie, what's going on?

4014
02:12:32,490 --> 02:12:33,990
Oh, uh, can you get...

4015
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:35,890
Go stand on the stairs and then push this thing?

4016
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:37,290
Alright, now...

4017
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:38,210
Ah, nice, nice, nice.

4018
02:12:38,410 --> 02:12:38,570
Okay.

4019
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:39,470
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4020
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:39,770
Sorry.

4021
02:12:40,170 --> 02:12:41,210
Where's the latex man?

4022
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:42,810
I think Nimi is distracting him.

4023
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:45,690
Alright, we're pushing.

4024
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,950
Slow and steady.

4025
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:48,690
Slow and steady.

4026
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:50,410
Almost there.

4027
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:51,190
Right here, right here.

4028
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:52,570
Push, push.

4029
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:53,790
Push.

4030
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:54,530
Dance.

4031
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:54,930
Yay!

4032
02:12:56,230 --> 02:12:57,110
Now what?

4033
02:12:57,270 --> 02:12:58,170
Got the dynamite!

4034
02:12:58,430 --> 02:12:58,750
Oh!

4035
02:12:59,190 --> 02:12:59,830
So we got...

4036
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:01,790
Where was that?

4037
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,770
Oh my God, where was that?

4038
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:04,790
It was the third...

4039
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:05,930
It was like...

4040
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:07,910
We have to go back through the basement.

4041
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:08,390
Yeah.

4042
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:11,090
Insert the electrical board, open the hatches.

4043
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:12,570
Save, save, save, save, save.

4044
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:14,730
Leave the laboratory and blow up...

4045
02:13:14,730 --> 02:13:15,410
Oh my God!

4046
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:17,270
I'm...

4047
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:19,550
Insert the electrical boards, open the...

4048
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:20,190
What?

4049
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:21,930
Wait...

4050
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:22,170
Huh?

4051
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:24,070
Insert the electrical boards, open the hatches.

4052
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:24,850
Where's that guy going?

4053
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:28,190
Do we lead the lab before?

4054
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,990
Instructions unclear.

4055
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:34,510
I don't know.

4056
02:13:34,750 --> 02:13:35,910
Where's the electrical board?

4057
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:39,390
Oh my god.

4058
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:44,410
Oh wait.

4059
02:13:46,730 --> 02:13:48,430
We can get more crystals if we lose it.

4060
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:49,230
I'm just looking at the other...

4061
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:50,110
Oh yeah, yeah.

4062
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:53,010
But we can't get more dynamite apparently.

4063
02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:53,730
Oh gosh.

4064
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:58,050
Oh, in the PC room, you got the electrical board earlier?

4065
02:13:58,790 --> 02:14:00,210
Where's PC room?

4066
02:14:02,350 --> 02:14:03,890
It looks like bacon.

4067
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:07,150
Chat!

4068
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:15,090
Maybe we just... Yeah, let's just leave.

4069
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:15,810
Oh, wait.

4070
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:16,950
Doobie!

4071
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:17,750
Wait, Doobie!

4072
02:14:18,170 --> 02:14:18,730
Wait, Doobie!

4073
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:24,520
Doobie!

4074
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:25,600
I thought she was in it!

4075
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:26,700
She's hanging out.

4076
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,160
She's hang... Oh wait, I'm gonna die!

4077
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:28,540
Oh!

4078
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:29,200
Oh, okay.

4079
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:30,620
Sorry.

4080
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:34,980
Aw...

4081
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:36,860
Okay, third floor.

4082
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,720
She got moon.

4083
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,640
Wait, we can revive her at the second floor.

4084
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,980
Oh yeah, that's true.

4085
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:43,100
Isn't it?

4086
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:44,500
There's no revive on the third, right?

4087
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,040
Mm-mm.

4088
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,260
Alright, let's go to the second.

4089
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:47,840
I don't remember.

4090
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,460
Too much radiation from the moon.

4091
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:53,060
Oh.

4092
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:53,680
Is that what it is?

4093
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:54,940
I guess?

4094
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,040
Probably, right?

4095
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:57,640
Too much orange.

4096
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:58,920
In all the orange.

4097
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,900
Yeah, yeah, and vitamin C.

4098
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:04,980
Alright.

4099
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:05,840
Okay!

4100
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:06,360
Okay!

4101
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:08,960
How is it having the moon virus?

4102
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,580
Better than having the COVID virus.

4103
02:15:12,820 --> 02:15:13,580
So true.

4104
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,220
That's so cute.

4105
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:18,900
Yeah, this one all you do is die.

4106
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,640
There was a purple board from the bottom floor?

4107
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:21,420
What?

4108
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:22,100
Was there?

4109
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:24,240
Did we get the one that was in the lab?

4110
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:26,460
Somebody had one, right?

4111
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,800
I don't remember.

4112
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:28,840
I don't...

4113
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:30,380
Who?

4114
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,900
Someone was definitely carrying one around.

4115
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,040
Oh, yeah, she left.

4116
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:35,500
Oh, she left.

4117
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:36,420
Oh, I know.

4118
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:37,060
It was where?

4119
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:37,860
Oh, gosh.

4120
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:38,800
I died.

4121
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:39,860
I...

4122
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:40,060
Oh.

4123
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,320
There was one.

4124
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,160
Downstairs.

4125
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:43,500
I died.

4126
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,440
I was holding it.

4127
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:45,380
Oh, okay.

4128
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:45,720
Wait, give...

4129
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,580
Okay, give us the diamond.

4130
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:47,500
We'll give you the moon.

4131
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:48,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4132
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:49,760
Wait, wait.

4133
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,380
Min's gonna get one of the electrical guards.

4134
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,300
It's downstairs.

4135
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:54,800
She needs the vitamin C.

4136
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:55,800
Yeah, I knew that.

4137
02:15:56,260 --> 02:15:56,280
There you go.

4138
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:57,280
Take it.

4139
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,920
We're playing soccer with it.

4140
02:15:59,080 --> 02:15:59,600
Wait, wait, wait.

4141
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,340
I'll come with you, cause like...

4142
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:02,940
You can't hold it with two hands, remember?

4143
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:04,260
Oh, you can't?

4144
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:05,080
I don't know, actually.

4145
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:06,720
I don't think so.

4146
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:07,280
Well, come on.

4147
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,240
Make sure you can't...

4148
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:09,120
Alright, let's go.

4149
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:09,780
We'll have to go anyway.

4150
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:10,500
First floor.

4151
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:11,620
First floor.

4152
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:12,740
So, where did you die?

4153
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,840
I know where I died.

4154
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:15,700
It was...

4155
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:16,400
So, where was it?

4156
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:17,400
It wasn't upstairs.

4157
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:18,140
It was downstairs.

4158
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:19,460
Okay, that's good.

4159
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:19,920
That's easy.

4160
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:20,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4161
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:21,500
Okay, wait.

4162
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:22,320
I'll hold the...

4163
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,800
I'll hold the orange then.

4164
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:25,360
Cause then you can grab the thing.

4165
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:27,460
I'll hold the orange.

4166
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:28,100
Come on.

4167
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:31,000
Okay, then I'll have to hold the fucking electrical board.

4168
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:32,100
Choose one or the other.

4169
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:32,800
It's right here.

4170
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:34,180
Oh, okay.

4171
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,400
Oh, that's a fucking gun.

4172
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:35,960
Oh, I got it.

4173
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:36,260
Yeah.

4174
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:37,680
Oh, you can hold one too.

4175
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:38,300
See, I told...

4176
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:39,780
You can hold up to three items.

4177
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,260
Okay, I didn't know that.

4178
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:43,480
I just got that.

4179
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:46,080
I thought you can only hold one item.

4180
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:48,680
Oh, I dropped all of them at the same time.

4181
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:48,960
Okay.

4182
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:49,080
Okay.

4183
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:49,980
Oh, good job.

4184
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:52,020
Yay.

4185
02:16:52,380 --> 02:16:52,740
Yay.

4186
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:56,060
Oh, I see what she meant by the placement of the gun.

4187
02:16:56,060 --> 02:16:56,560
Yeah, right.

4188
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:57,300
Oh.

4189
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,480
You're making some people very happy right now.

4190
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,640
We got one of the electrical boards.

4191
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:10,040
Yeah.

4192
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,400
I don't know what the other ones are though.

4193
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:13,440
Where do we insert it?

4194
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:14,320
Right here, right here.

4195
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:18,100
Yeah.

4196
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:18,360
Okay.

4197
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,280
Where was the other one?

4198
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:20,860
I don't remember.

4199
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:21,620
There's only three more.

4200
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:21,880
Yeah.

4201
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:22,720
Chat!

4202
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:24,040
Where are the other three?

4203
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:26,340
Other three?!

4204
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:30,060
Oh, this one says two here, but I think somewhere else...

4205
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:31,520
Oh...

4206
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:33,920
We didn't see anything, did we?

4207
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:35,600
I don't know.

4208
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,720
Don't remember.

4209
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,580
Other three are outside.

4210
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,180
Outside?

4211
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:43,140
Other three are outside?

4212
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:45,280
There's one...

4213
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:46,160
One person.

4214
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,420
One singular person.

4215
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,800
The one guy.

4216
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:50,300
The one guy.

4217
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,760
Alright, do we need to get one guy?

4218
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:57,680
Oh, somebody said there was one in the computer lab.

4219
02:17:58,300 --> 02:17:59,460
Do we trust that guy?

4220
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:00,200
That one guy?

4221
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:02,100
Oh, we have to bring the orange to him too.

4222
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:02,760
The crystal.

4223
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,540
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4224
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:04,340
Might as well, yeah.

4225
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:05,400
Okay, let's go then, yeah.

4226
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:08,000
Where does the dynamite go?

4227
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:10,720
Isn't he gonna turn into like an evil creature though?

4228
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:12,640
I know, I feel like that's gonna happen.

4229
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:13,520
He's gonna be friendly.

4230
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,340
Maybe he's gonna be friendly.

4231
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:15,480
He's gonna join our party.

4232
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:16,140
Okay.

4233
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:17,160
We'll have five people.

4234
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:17,900
Was it first floor?

4235
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:18,620
Oh, was it first floor?

4236
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:18,980
Yeah.

4237
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:19,320
Okay.

4238
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:20,440
Oh, yeah.

4239
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:21,600
I wanna go back to the basement.

4240
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:21,740
I wanna go back to the basement.

4241
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:24,880
It was first floor and then we gotta go to the third floor.

4242
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:26,060
Yeah, yeah.

4243
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:27,520
I wanna get to the third floor.

4244
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,180
Oh, we should save.

4245
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:30,600
Oh, yeah, we should.

4246
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,840
Um, where was the save for?

4247
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:36,500
Okay, we have to go back to the running van.

4248
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:40,060
Where's the save here, anyway?

4249
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:42,560
I don't remember any of this.

4250
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,840
This looks new to me.

4251
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:44,780
Oh, here we go.

4252
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,040
Put the diamond, yeah.

4253
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:46,820
Oh.

4254
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:50,780
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4255
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:51,960
Nice.

4256
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:54,400
Okay, we did that.

4257
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:56,620
There's definitely gonna be something in here.

4258
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:56,920
There's a shortcut.

4259
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:57,300
There's a shortcut, yeah.

4260
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:57,760
Yeah, see?

4261
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,540
Oh, it's just outside.

4262
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:00,240
electrical boards are out here.

4263
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:02,480
Oh, that's what the one guy said.

4264
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:03,260
Yeah.

4265
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:04,480
Oh, wait, what's this?

4266
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:04,780
Oh.

4267
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:07,120
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

4268
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,100
Guys, guys, guys.

4269
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:11,000
Where'd he go?

4270
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:12,020
Where'd he go?

4271
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:14,000
Oh my gosh, I see the slender man too.

4272
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:15,460
Oh, that means the third floor is free.

4273
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:18,580
Oh, we have to be even more careful out here.

4274
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:19,100
She was in.

4275
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:19,940
Oh.

4276
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:26,360
Holy moly.

4277
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:28,380
We open both doors now.

4278
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,300
But what?

4279
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:31,420
I think we can go like anywhere now.

4280
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:31,920
Maybe the election floors are out.

4281
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:32,200
Okay, wait.

4282
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:33,920
That means the third floor should be like...

4283
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:34,860
I don't think we should...

4284
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:35,620
It's not dangerous anymore, right?

4285
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:37,760
Yeah, but I don't think we should explore until we save.

4286
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:38,380
Oh.

4287
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:39,340
Yeah, we should save, yeah.

4288
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:40,840
But where is the safe foot?

4289
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:41,940
I don't know.

4290
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:44,080
I don't know.

4291
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,040
I don't know.

4292
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:46,120
I don't know.

4293
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:49,320
I saw slender man in the other building.

4294
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:51,720
So I think we're safe here.

4295
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:53,380
We changed his brother too.

4296
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:54,360
Famous last words.

4297
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,240
He likes stairs.

4298
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,220
He does like stairs.

4299
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:00,540
He's gross.

4300
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:01,420
But he's gone.

4301
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:02,000
Wait.

4302
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:03,760
Doobie said she found it?

4303
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:04,540
Oh.

4304
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:12,600
Coming to the sound of your voice.

4305
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:13,920
Oh, you're upstairs.

4306
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:14,620
I'm downstairs.

4307
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:15,660
Yeah, yeah, we're downstairs.

4308
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:15,980
Downstairs?

4309
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:16,420
Downstairs.

4310
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,140
Oh, yeah, there.

4311
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:17,740
I see.

4312
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:19,040
Where?

4313
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,380
Right here.

4314
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:21,140
Oh.

4315
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:22,540
Yay.

4316
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:23,200
Okay.

4317
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:24,480
Now we can explore.

4318
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:25,960
Okay, now...

4319
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:28,200
Let's go to the TV room because the monster's not here anymore.

4320
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:29,940
Look behind you.

4321
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:31,240
Oh my god.

4322
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,460
Okay, there's that guy though.

4323
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:34,800
Let's go to the TV room.

4324
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,500
Third floor.

4325
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:37,300
Okay.

4326
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4327
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:38,900
Third floor, third floor.

4328
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4329
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:40,800
We went up the...

4330
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:43,020
Mimi and I went up and the monster was gone.

4331
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:43,940
Nice.

4332
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:45,260
It was like here.

4333
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:47,120
Oh, yeah, here.

4334
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:48,820
Here we go.

4335
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,480
Da da da da da da.

4336
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:52,220
Da da da da da da.

4337
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:52,280
Da da da da da da.

4338
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:53,300
Oh, we did it guys.

4339
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,840
We liberated the third floor.

4340
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:55,380
Yay!

4341
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:57,220
We're doing, but we're doing it.

4342
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:57,740
We are.

4343
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:59,120
We're giving them the orange.

4344
02:20:59,540 --> 02:20:59,760
I have.

4345
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:01,160
I know, but I just mean in general.

4346
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:02,200
Like, what are we doing?

4347
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:05,120
I have PTSD of these hallways.

4348
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,740
After we found the moon.

4349
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:08,080
Oh, look.

4350
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,400
Oh, that's how he broke out.

4351
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:10,620
Yeah, he...

4352
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:12,840
What the heck is that mustache eyeball?

4353
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,820
This school is weird.

4354
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:20,040
I don't...

4355
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,240
I don't know who it is.

4356
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:22,500
We're saving the moon.

4357
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:23,500
That's right.

4358
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:24,560
We're saving the moon.

4359
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:26,960
Oh, where is he?

4360
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:27,700
TV man.

4361
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:28,920
Oh, there he is.

4362
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:29,460
Look.

4363
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,300
I got an orange for you.

4364
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:30,880
Yeah.

4365
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:32,200
Hey, hi.

4366
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:32,940
Oh.

4367
02:21:33,220 --> 02:21:33,600
Hey.

4368
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,480
Who are you?

4369
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:35,980
I'm a TV head.

4370
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:37,600
That guy, look at his body.

4371
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:39,460
He's definitely going to turn into...

4372
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:39,900
Yeah.

4373
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:41,240
I have a TV instead of a head.

4374
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:41,720
But I'm...

4375
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:42,040
Oh, yeah.

4376
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:42,280
Okay.

4377
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,500
This is all the same thing.

4378
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,180
Does he want it?

4379
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:47,480
Does he not want it?

4380
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:50,420
Is he just here for storytelling reasons?

4381
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,200
Wait, he doesn't want the orange?

4382
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,080
Maybe it's the wrong one.

4383
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:56,340
Wrong orange.

4384
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:56,900
Nah.

4385
02:21:58,260 --> 02:21:59,800
Okay, then we'll just leave it here.

4386
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:00,800
We don't need it, I think.

4387
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:01,680
Yeah.

4388
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:02,200
That's safe.

4389
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:04,660
Safe.

4390
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,220
Safe anyway.

4391
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:07,680
Alright, so we go outside.

4392
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,680
Ta- I'm gonna fall from the third story.

4393
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,260
Here I go!

4394
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:22,360
Wait, is that an electrical panel right...

4395
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:23,120
Wait, you guys!

4396
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:24,100
What?

4397
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:26,220
I think there's an electrical panel down here.

4398
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:29,440
Yeah, I see it.

4399
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:35,170
Do you think it touches?

4400
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:37,170
Of all those baby hands?

4401
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:37,890
No, I think that one is...

4402
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:38,290
Oh, wait!

4403
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:39,350
I can't fall...

4404
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:40,550
I can't walk out the door.

4405
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:41,950
No, no, that's like the fence.

4406
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:42,950
You see that fence over there?

4407
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:44,690
That's where we exploded the dynamite.

4408
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:46,890
Yeah, I know, but I thought I would be able to fall.

4409
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:49,090
No, you can't.

4410
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:49,550
Dang.

4411
02:22:49,550 --> 02:22:50,350
No, you can't.

4412
02:22:50,350 --> 02:22:51,050
You can't do a flip.

4413
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:52,390
I tried jumping off earlier.

4414
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:54,130
Alright, it's this way.

4415
02:22:56,570 --> 02:22:57,450
Down we go!

4416
02:23:02,050 --> 02:23:02,370
Doodoo.

4417
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,290
Boodoo.

4418
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:03,910
Boodoo.

4419
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:04,830
Oh, too many.

4420
02:23:05,750 --> 02:23:06,710
Alright, here we go.

4421
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:07,630
Alright.

4422
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:09,590
Grab that one electrical panel.

4423
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:10,290
Where?

4424
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:12,970
There's something evil here.

4425
02:23:17,210 --> 02:23:17,730
Oh, no!

4426
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:18,490
It needs it!

4427
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:19,650
It needs two of them!

4428
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:20,770
What?

4429
02:23:21,250 --> 02:23:21,470
Two?

4430
02:23:21,790 --> 02:23:22,110
Yeah.

4431
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:23,430
Oh, wait!

4432
02:23:23,550 --> 02:23:24,990
So this is where the other one is, I guess.

4433
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:25,290
Yeah!

4434
02:23:25,290 --> 02:23:26,030
Oh, the other two!

4435
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:26,690
Yeah!

4436
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:30,630
Oh, this is the top of the same laboratory.

4437
02:23:30,970 --> 02:23:31,190
Yeah!

4438
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:32,570
This door.

4439
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:33,850
What's this mustache?

4440
02:23:35,950 --> 02:23:36,890
You think that...

4441
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:37,670
I found a shortcut!

4442
02:23:38,330 --> 02:23:39,170
Oh, shortcut!

4443
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:39,690
Oh, nice!

4444
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:40,690
Let's go!

4445
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:43,510
Silent Hill moments?

4446
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:51,390
This is where we met our wife.

4447
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,290
Oh, yeah, we're here!

4448
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:53,610
And the kitten!

4449
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:55,230
I missed that kitten.

4450
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:55,370
Okay.

4451
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:57,770
Maybe the electrical board is on the other side.

4452
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:58,390
Remember, there's...

4453
02:23:58,390 --> 02:23:59,410
There's that side, too.

4454
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:04,700
Hmm...

4455
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:05,840
Nothing in here.

4456
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:08,520
This is where we put in the password.

4457
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:12,100
Uh-oh.

4458
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:13,460
I lost everybody.

4459
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:20,820
My friends.

4460
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,000
My friends!

4461
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:22,800
My friends!

4462
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:23,800
No!

4463
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:26,320
No!

4464
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:26,460
No!

4465
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:27,860
No!

4466
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:41,780
Let me know!

4467
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:45,760
Oh, okay.

4468
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,770
Look

4469
02:24:57,650 --> 02:25:01,550
how Nimi's infected body chased after you.

4470
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:03,490
That was pretty freaky.

4471
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:04,370
Safe point over here?

4472
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:05,550
You would say she's...

4473
02:25:05,550 --> 02:25:06,530
My nightmare.

4474
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:12,130
Let's go...

4475
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:13,890
Let's go to safe point.

4476
02:25:14,070 --> 02:25:14,790
Where's safe point here?

4477
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:15,790
Are you sitting?

4478
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:17,190
Wait, you can sit here?

4479
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:17,830
Yeah.

4480
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:19,850
Just, you know, thinking.

4481
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:21,410
Just thinking.

4482
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:24,450
It's been a long night.

4483
02:25:24,830 --> 02:25:26,710
Like, you can take a little breather, right?

4484
02:25:27,110 --> 02:25:27,370
Yeah.

4485
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:27,970
Yeah.

4486
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:28,970
I'm also gonna...

4487
02:25:28,970 --> 02:25:30,570
I'm gonna do something to relax.

4488
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:31,550
Take the nerves off.

4489
02:25:31,550 --> 02:25:32,330
Yeah.

4490
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:33,590
I hear that.

4491
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,370
That's for us.

4492
02:25:36,490 --> 02:25:36,650
Yes.

4493
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:38,270
Yeah.

4494
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:40,530
This is just how I think, you know?

4495
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:41,230
Yeah.

4496
02:25:41,570 --> 02:25:42,010
Yeah.

4497
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:43,910
At least in some stress, you know?

4498
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:46,850
Me too.

4499
02:25:46,990 --> 02:25:47,670
Yeah, I feel that.

4500
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:52,050
I gotta do a little flip to feel better.

4501
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:56,590
I just witnessed my friend's death in front of my eyes.

4502
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,890
There's a safe point over here.

4503
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,330
I forgot.

4504
02:25:58,330 --> 02:25:59,290
Isn't it by the basement?

4505
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,230
Like this way?

4506
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:00,810
Yeah, I think.

4507
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:01,930
Oh, the other way.

4508
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:02,310
Other way.

4509
02:26:02,450 --> 02:26:03,050
Is the basement.

4510
02:26:03,270 --> 02:26:03,610
Oh, wait.

4511
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:04,330
There's...

4512
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:04,670
No, yeah.

4513
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:05,550
There's...

4514
02:26:05,550 --> 02:26:06,130
By the basement.

4515
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:07,530
There should be like one more.

4516
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:10,910
I can't remember.

4517
02:26:11,170 --> 02:26:11,410
Oh, wait.

4518
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,750
No, no.

4519
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:12,510
You're right, Doobie.

4520
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:13,030
You're right.

4521
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:13,550
You're right.

4522
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:14,690
There's the easier one.

4523
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:16,170
Sorry.

4524
02:26:16,410 --> 02:26:17,010
Don't listen to me.

4525
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,590
Yeah.

4526
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:20,310
Always listen to the others.

4527
02:26:20,610 --> 02:26:21,550
It was this right here.

4528
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:22,670
Yeah, here.

4529
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:23,590
Found it.

4530
02:26:25,710 --> 02:26:26,070
Sorry.

4531
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:26,190
All right.

4532
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:27,170
All right.

4533
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:27,850
Welcome back.

4534
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:29,410
Hello.

4535
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:30,450
Hello.

4536
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:33,010
You like that we danced on top of your dead body?

4537
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,270
Yeah.

4538
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:37,610
It was a way to grieve.

4539
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:38,850
I thought it would have passed into the afterlife.

4540
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:40,570
So, congrats.

4541
02:26:42,090 --> 02:26:43,470
Tell me about it.

4542
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:44,170
Tell me about it.

4543
02:26:46,830 --> 02:26:48,170
What can I do for you today?

4544
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:51,390
Um, I'm looking for an electrical panel.

4545
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:52,090
Yeah.

4546
02:26:52,570 --> 02:26:53,210
Oh, I...

4547
02:26:53,210 --> 02:26:55,670
I think it's somewhere like on the left side.

4548
02:26:55,810 --> 02:26:57,010
I'm thinking like over there.

4549
02:26:57,590 --> 02:26:58,310
Oh, I see it.

4550
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:01,810
Um, do you recommend me some restaurants nearby?

4551
02:27:03,590 --> 02:27:04,370
Yeah, we haven't...

4552
02:27:04,370 --> 02:27:04,790
There's no...

4553
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:06,510
Maybe we're robots.

4554
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:08,230
Just like that robot was...

4555
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:09,410
Oh, what are we just...

4556
02:27:09,410 --> 02:27:10,950
Oh, what are we just driving?

4557
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:13,310
Probably wise.

4558
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:15,250
Where are they now?

4559
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,990
Wait, where are you guys going?

4560
02:27:16,990 --> 02:27:18,510
We have to go out this way.

4561
02:27:18,690 --> 02:27:19,110
We do?

4562
02:27:19,710 --> 02:27:20,170
Yeah.

4563
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:20,970
Oh, okay.

4564
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:21,350
Remember when the...

4565
02:27:21,350 --> 02:27:22,330
Did you look at the walk through?

4566
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:23,210
Yeah.

4567
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:26,790
The area where he died.

4568
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:27,510
Oh.

4569
02:27:28,770 --> 02:27:30,210
Yeah, it was like...

4570
02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:30,990
Right here.

4571
02:27:31,330 --> 02:27:32,070
Okay, you go first.

4572
02:27:32,170 --> 02:27:32,750
You got the flashlight.

4573
02:27:53,790 --> 02:27:54,830
He's camping.

4574
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:56,150
He's spawn camping.

4575
02:27:57,070 --> 02:27:57,650
He is.

4576
02:28:02,630 --> 02:28:03,890
Okay, she's gone.

4577
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:04,490
Let's...

4578
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:05,790
Let's revive her, I guess.

4579
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:06,530
Okay.

4580
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:06,690
Okay.

4581
02:28:07,050 --> 02:28:07,450
Okay.

4582
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:10,190
Oh, wait.

4583
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:11,010
Did I go the...

4584
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:11,890
I went the wrong way, sorry.

4585
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,910
I'm just blindly following.

4586
02:28:16,410 --> 02:28:17,190
Yeah, me too.

4587
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:18,070
That's fine.

4588
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,850
I'll lead you to greatness.

4589
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,050
He's right...

4590
02:28:23,050 --> 02:28:25,070
Guys, he's right behind me.

4591
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:34,580
Oh, wait.

4592
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,320
Wrong way, sorry.

4593
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:36,580
Don't follow me.

4594
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,000
He's here now.

4595
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,060
He's here now.

4596
02:28:37,060 --> 02:28:37,080
He's here now.

4597
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:38,000
What?

4598
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:38,740
He's here, he's here.

4599
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:39,460
Where?

4600
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:41,540
Oh, he's here.

4601
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:42,100
Yeah, he's here.

4602
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,760
He's directly in front of us, outside.

4603
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,400
Okay, so we should be able to go now.

4604
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:48,400
What if there's more than one?

4605
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:49,660
There might be.

4606
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:50,700
I think there's only one.

4607
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:51,880
There could be more than one.

4608
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:53,500
Wait, do we go here?

4609
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,180
I think...

4610
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:54,780
He's right there.

4611
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:55,420
He's right there.

4612
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:55,960
He's right there.

4613
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:03,050
Am I getting chased?

4614
02:29:03,790 --> 02:29:04,330
No.

4615
02:29:04,770 --> 02:29:05,250
Okay.

4616
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:12,300
What's that scary music?

4617
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,040
I think it's like...

4618
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:15,660
Caterpillar.

4619
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:17,380
We actually been here.

4620
02:29:20,410 --> 02:29:21,290
What about...

4621
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:21,790
That was where the...

4622
02:29:21,790 --> 02:29:22,530
That was where the...

4623
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:23,650
That was the cafeteria that...

4624
02:29:23,650 --> 02:29:24,590
Where we opened...

4625
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:26,130
Um...

4626
02:29:26,130 --> 02:29:27,290
When we had to go outside...

4627
02:29:27,290 --> 02:29:30,130
There's like that second floor room with all the monitors.

4628
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:31,110
I feel...

4629
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:32,090
Have we been in there?

4630
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:36,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4631
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:36,570
Here.

4632
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:38,410
Where do we go now?

4633
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:40,230
Open the gates to the surrounding area.

4634
02:29:41,430 --> 02:29:41,870
Uh...

4635
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:42,330
Okay, there's a cat in there.

4636
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:44,290
Oh, same point!

4637
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:45,910
Our girlfriend!

4638
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:46,670
Our girlfriend!

4639
02:29:47,230 --> 02:29:48,290
Oh, there she is!

4640
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:49,570
Strangeline.

4641
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:50,510
Oh.

4642
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:52,410
Oh, I found another oak gate.

4643
02:29:52,670 --> 02:29:54,390
Are you planning to go inside the annex?

4644
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:56,730
Are we?

4645
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:57,450
Uh...

4646
02:29:57,450 --> 02:29:57,550
Yes.

4647
02:29:58,310 --> 02:29:59,490
You know, there...

4648
02:29:59,490 --> 02:30:00,930
There were others before you.

4649
02:30:00,990 --> 02:30:01,630
Stop talking to me!

4650
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:02,490
Similar to...

4651
02:30:02,490 --> 02:30:03,970
I'm learning the lore!

4652
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:07,390
Many of them went there.

4653
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:10,190
But I haven't seen anyone who came back from there.

4654
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:11,250
Even though you see...

4655
02:30:11,250 --> 02:30:11,890
I don't wanna stand around the corner!

4656
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:12,330
Oh, okay.

4657
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:13,550
Oh, I've tried.

4658
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:16,210
She disappeared!

4659
02:30:16,830 --> 02:30:17,310
Ah!

4660
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:18,750
Like...

4661
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:20,170
Like how we're all spamming.

4662
02:30:20,170 --> 02:30:21,770
Wait, we're going into a new building!

4663
02:30:21,970 --> 02:30:22,430
That's why.

4664
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:25,850
Oh...

4665
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:26,750
We're going here?

4666
02:30:26,970 --> 02:30:28,010
Yeah, the annex.

4667
02:30:28,430 --> 02:30:28,850
Oh!

4668
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,230
Oh!

4669
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:31,690
Uh-oh.

4670
02:30:31,930 --> 02:30:32,590
I don't like it.

4671
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:32,870
I don't wanna...

4672
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:33,770
I hear somebody...

4673
02:30:33,770 --> 02:30:34,750
I hear somebody breathing.

4674
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:36,290
Me too.

4675
02:30:37,330 --> 02:30:39,070
I don't see anything on my scanner.

4676
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:42,070
Wait...

4677
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:43,210
Maybe he's gone...

4678
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:43,770
Yeah, he's gone.

4679
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:44,510
Maybe he just...

4680
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:45,450
He got scared away.

4681
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:46,610
From us?

4682
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:48,370
Haha, we're a bunch of baddies.

4683
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:51,150
It looks like he's...

4684
02:30:51,150 --> 02:30:51,730
It looks familiar.

4685
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:53,930
It does look a little familiar.

4686
02:30:54,310 --> 02:30:55,590
But the doors aren't open.

4687
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:56,110
Right?

4688
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:56,210
Okay.

4689
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:03,020
I hear somebody breathing.

4690
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,880
I don't see anything on the scanner.

4691
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:08,920
Oh wait, is it the other...?

4692
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:16,970
Wait, one, two, three... This is one.

4693
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:17,530
Me.

4694
02:31:20,230 --> 02:31:21,990
Oh, explore the annex.

4695
02:31:22,330 --> 02:31:22,450
Okay.

4696
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:23,850
Okay.

4697
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:26,310
Is this the annex?

4698
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:28,530
Yeah, but there is a breathing man in here.

4699
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:30,590
Oh, hello.

4700
02:31:36,620 --> 02:31:37,540
Uh-oh.

4701
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:39,020
That's her eggs!

4702
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:44,090
The magic tells you not to worry about.

4703
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:50,430
Oh, we just watched our comrade die in front of our faces.

4704
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:54,290
Oh, um... Oh, oh, oh, oh!

4705
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,080
Does that do me?

4706
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:12,260
Oh...

4707
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:13,100
I think that was do me.

4708
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:24,730
Is it gonna open that door?

4709
02:32:25,130 --> 02:32:26,130
Oh, hello.

4710
02:32:26,410 --> 02:32:26,750
Hey.

4711
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:27,670
Hi.

4712
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:28,410
Oh, hey.

4713
02:32:28,810 --> 02:32:29,570
I think it's just us.

4714
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:30,290
Did Doobie die?

4715
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:31,490
Yeah, I watched her die.

4716
02:32:32,350 --> 02:32:36,910
Oh, that's like how it approached Nimi from behind.

4717
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:38,590
Yeah, I know.

4718
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:39,770
Wait.

4719
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:41,330
Hello?

4720
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:42,130
Did you hear that?

4721
02:32:42,610 --> 02:32:43,090
Hello?

4722
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:44,390
Oh, Nimi!

4723
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:46,030
Nimi, you're alive?

4724
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:47,030
I'm alive.

4725
02:32:47,210 --> 02:32:48,430
I unlocked the door somewhere.

4726
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:49,850
Wait, how did you do this?

4727
02:32:49,850 --> 02:32:50,930
I thought I killed you?

4728
02:32:51,170 --> 02:32:51,710
I ran.

4729
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,550
I ran.

4730
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:52,550
Oh!

4731
02:32:53,170 --> 02:32:53,170
What?

4732
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:55,410
Oh!

4733
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:57,010
She's... Gamer.

4734
02:32:57,010 --> 02:33:00,510
Oh, so I almost... Go, run, run, run with you.

4735
02:33:00,650 --> 02:33:02,090
Go, go, go, go.

4736
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:04,830
Go, go, go.

4737
02:33:04,830 --> 02:33:05,030
Go, go, go.

4738
02:33:05,470 --> 02:33:05,470
Go, go, go.

4739
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:08,350
I don't think you can open doors.

4740
02:33:10,030 --> 02:33:12,290
Uh... Okay, I feel like none of us closed the door.

4741
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:18,810
Um... Well, you know... It is what it is.

4742
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:20,670
What's this guy gonna say?

4743
02:33:21,610 --> 02:33:22,050
Nothing?

4744
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:24,810
It's a silent protag.

4745
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:29,640
Oh, I hear him.

4746
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:30,840
I hear him walking outside.

4747
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:31,080
Yeah, me too.

4748
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:32,640
But he goes around, though.

4749
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:33,160
Yeah.

4750
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:37,240
One of the capsules is located in the... How big?

4751
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:37,740
Ouch!

4752
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,300
How long is this game?

4753
02:33:39,340 --> 02:33:40,040
I don't know!

4754
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:43,760
After we opened the laboratory, we... We saw the bed!

4755
02:33:44,180 --> 02:33:45,540
Just pick it up with our hands!

4756
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:49,260
I don't hear him.

4757
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:49,820
Should I open it?

4758
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:50,340
Oh.

4759
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:51,520
Okay.

4760
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:52,020
Okay.

4761
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:55,280
I think we're... We're fine.

4762
02:33:58,990 --> 02:34:00,550
I don't know where to go, guys.

4763
02:34:01,010 --> 02:34:01,890
I don't know either.

4764
02:34:02,410 --> 02:34:02,410
I don't know either.

4765
02:34:03,550 --> 02:34:04,770
You don't have the flashlight on.

4766
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:05,050
Let me sweat.

4767
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:17,680
Is everybody alive?

4768
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:19,300
I'm alive.

4769
02:34:24,470 --> 02:34:25,410
Are you alive?

4770
02:34:36,030 --> 02:34:38,830
Yeah, I would come to you, but he's like, right outside the door.

4771
02:34:41,810 --> 02:34:43,070
Can you guys hear her?

4772
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:50,560
He's like, right outside.

4773
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,720
Maybe?

4774
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:55,300
Barely.

4775
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:56,180
Me too.

4776
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:56,760
Barely.

4777
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:04,320
Hello?

4778
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:08,680
He's right behind me, isn't he?

4779
02:35:18,710 --> 02:35:19,250
Ducky!

4780
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:26,980
I can't get over there.

4781
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:35,730
He goes through doors.

4782
02:35:35,810 --> 02:35:36,390
He goes through doors.

4783
02:35:36,530 --> 02:35:36,730
He goes through doors.

4784
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:37,570
He does?!

4785
02:35:37,570 --> 02:35:38,170
He does!

4786
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:38,610
He does.

4787
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:38,970
He does.

4788
02:35:39,370 --> 02:35:39,690
He does.

4789
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:39,970
Oh, shit!

4790
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:40,530
Oh, shit!

4791
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:41,050
Oh, shit!

4792
02:35:41,390 --> 02:35:41,390

SH

4850
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:19,110
Oh!

4851
02:36:19,110 --> 02:36:20,050
What are you like?

4852
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:20,930
Oh, shit.

4853
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:26,250
Oh my god, he jumps at you.

4854
02:36:26,490 --> 02:36:27,510
He lunges.

4855
02:36:28,030 --> 02:36:28,650
I was like, oh.

4856
02:36:30,690 --> 02:36:31,670
I'm sorry.

4857
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:33,270
I can't help it.

4858
02:36:38,510 --> 02:36:40,970
Oh, sorry, Neme.

4859
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:50,890
This guy's insane.

4860
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:53,030
Wait, is she still alive?

4861
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:56,610
I can just hear her laughing.

4862
02:36:57,350 --> 02:36:58,670
Oh, I can hear you.

4863
02:36:59,510 --> 02:37:00,070
Oh.

4864
02:37:01,210 --> 02:37:01,910
I can...oh.

4865
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:04,590
Our voices come out of the thing.

4866
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:09,370
We're back.

4867
02:37:10,090 --> 02:37:10,650
Okay.

4868
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:11,690
Okay.

4869
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:15,130
This guy is kind of insane.

4870
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:17,570
Yeah, but look at him jumping.

4871
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:18,470
I know.

4872
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:21,610
You can't... You're doing a good job like, uh, dodging him.

4873
02:37:21,610 --> 02:37:25,690
Yeah, you know what, Doki, what if you act as the bait and we'll push.

4874
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:27,550
You were so good at dodging him.

4875
02:37:28,390 --> 02:37:29,630
Alright, yes.

4876
02:37:29,930 --> 02:37:30,850
Okay, here, here, here.

4877
02:37:30,930 --> 02:37:32,090
Push here, push here, push here.

4878
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:32,850
Push?

4879
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:34,070
It's in here.

4880
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:35,570
Push here and then you push out from here.

4881
02:37:35,730 --> 02:37:36,330
In the front.

4882
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:37,070
Don't worry, guys.

4883
02:37:38,610 --> 02:37:39,170
He's here!

4884
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:39,610
He's here!

4885
02:37:39,730 --> 02:37:40,150
He's coming!

4886
02:37:40,350 --> 02:37:40,790
He's coming!

4887
02:37:41,850 --> 02:37:42,250
Run!

4888
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,430
He's behind us!

4889
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:45,210
What is that?

4890
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:46,650
Oh, he's on Nimi.

4891
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:47,830
He's on Nimi.

4892
02:37:49,050 --> 02:37:49,450
Let's push it.

4893
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:50,190
Let's push it.

4894
02:37:50,190 --> 02:37:51,170
Let's push it.

4895
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:54,710
You're getting in a corner!

4896
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:55,750
You're getting in a corner!

4897
02:37:56,130 --> 02:37:56,950
Oh my god.

4898
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:57,790
I got scared.

4899
02:37:57,970 --> 02:37:59,010
I got scared.

4900
02:37:59,230 --> 02:38:00,090
Okay, hold on, hold on.

4901
02:38:00,570 --> 02:38:01,090
Okay, okay.

4902
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:02,130
Oh, shoot.

4903
02:38:02,390 --> 02:38:02,670
Push.

4904
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:03,830
Yeah.

4905
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:04,650
There we go.

4906
02:38:05,650 --> 02:38:06,050
Okay.

4907
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:07,270
I just saw Nimi.

4908
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:07,850
Oh, there she is.

4909
02:38:08,170 --> 02:38:08,630
Nimi, Nimi!

4910
02:38:10,050 --> 02:38:10,990
Okay, okay, that's good.

4911
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:11,810
We can push out, right?

4912
02:38:12,670 --> 02:38:16,650
Uh, she's no longer distracting him, so we don't know where he is.

4913
02:38:17,370 --> 02:38:18,850
I don't know where Doobie is.

4914
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:20,150
Maybe Doobie's got him.

4915
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:20,970
Doobie!

4916
02:38:20,970 --> 02:38:21,630
Oh my god, he's surprised.

4917
02:38:21,850 --> 02:38:22,130
He's surprised!

4918
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:23,230
Wait, wait, wait, wait, go, go, go, go!

4919
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:27,550
What is he?

4920
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:28,290
What is he?

4921
02:38:28,330 --> 02:38:28,870
I don't know!

4922
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:31,190
Oh, wait!

4923
02:38:31,530 --> 02:38:32,430
Ooh, what's this?

4924
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:34,010
This is a report from Squad 2.

4925
02:38:34,270 --> 02:38:36,230
The situation is strange, to say the least.

4926
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:37,930
We found traces of Squad 1.

4927
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:39,890
But what happened to them has left us in shock.

4928
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:41,590
They're infected with something unknown.

4929
02:38:41,870 --> 02:38:44,650
Their bodies have changed, transformed into huge, terrifying monsters.

4930
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:46,550
These aren't the people we once knew.

4931
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:48,130
We're trying to figure out what happened.

4932
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:50,610
In the meantime, we're returning our main objective.

4933
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:51,750
The search for the moon.

4934
02:38:52,990 --> 02:38:54,910
Let's release the moon.

4935
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:56,250
Let's release the moon.

4936
02:38:56,750 --> 02:38:57,890
People are dying.

4937
02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:03,150
Is it us?

4938
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:03,770
Are we dying?

4939
02:39:06,430 --> 02:39:06,890
Okay.

4940
02:39:07,390 --> 02:39:08,270
Sound safe.

4941
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:20,640
I think so.

4942
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,580
She's yelling a lot.

4943
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:24,100
Are you pushing it?

4944
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,140
I did it.

4945
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:25,840
I did one of them.

4946
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:27,360
But one of them is in the industrial building.

4947
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:28,020
Okay, we gotta save.

4948
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:28,920
We gotta go to the save point.

4949
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:29,780
I'm gonna go to the save point.

4950
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:32,360
Wait, but is Nimi and Doobie alive?

4951
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:34,420
Uh, Nimi was last alive when I saw her.

4952
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:35,920
Oh, okay.

4953
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:38,540
Well, maybe she'll know to go if we click on it.

4954
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:39,520
Save point!

4955
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:40,860
Come to the save point!

4956
02:39:40,860 --> 02:39:41,620
We got save point!

4957
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:42,420
Come to the save point!

4958
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:42,580
Okay, okay.

4959
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:43,580
Wait, how did you get there?

4960
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:45,520
Um, Nimi's dead!

4961
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:47,240
Or you could... or you could die.

4962
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:48,740
Or...

4963
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:50,840
Just... just... just die!

4964
02:39:52,060 --> 02:39:53,560
It's easier that way!

4965
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:54,060
It's easier that way!

4966
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:57,460
Okay, we're here.

4967
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:59,160
I'll say...

4968
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:00,980
Min said, wanted you to be dead.

4969
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:01,520
I was like...

4970
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:04,320
No, just so that we could revive easily, you know.

4971
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:05,680
Okay, wait, where's the...

4972
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,040
We have to check a different building, right?

4973
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:09,200
Yeah, it says, what is in the industrial building?

4974
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:10,840
Where the fuck is the industrial building?

4975
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:11,440
How?

4976
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:12,900
Yeah, push one of the capsules.

4977
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,040
Where to find the other building?

4978
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:16,240
Well... all the way!

4979
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,040
How?

4980
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:18,660
I don't know.

4981
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:19,900
It looks industrial.

4982
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:21,260
It does look industrial.

4983
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:22,280
Does this look like...

4984
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:24,340
Hello, are you the industrial building?

4985
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:24,740
Oh, here we go!

4986
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,000
Nice!

4987
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:27,100
Oh, it is industrial!

4988
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:27,440
Oh,

4989
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:31,740
I hear a...

4990
02:40:31,740 --> 02:40:33,360
I hear a breathing man.

4991
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:34,820
Report from Squad 3.

4992
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,220
Oh, yeah.

4993
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:36,420
This is complete disaster, guys.

4994
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:38,960
Squad 2, teams, they've turned into some kind of monsters.

4995
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:40,340
Moving on all fours.

4996
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:41,340
And they look like...

4997
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:41,980
Oh my god, they're enormous!

4998
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:43,500
And we keep searching for those.

4999
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:43,960
Because everyone...

5000
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,120
Guys...

5001
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:46,460
We decided to send one person northwest.

5002
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,980
Let them try to find something, anything.

5003
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,620
The rest of us are all falling back to the building and search for clues there.

5004
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:51,580
Hopefully, this will work.

5005
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:52,520
Over and out.

5006
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:53,620
Over and out.

5007
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:54,460
Alright.

5008
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:54,940
Don't worry.

5009
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:56,120
We're better than that squad.

5010
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:57,440
Yeah, we're squad.

5011
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,360
We're Mickey 17.

5012
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:00,200
Guys, there's three of them.

5013
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:01,520
There's three of them.

5014
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:02,680
Guys, there's four of them.

5015
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:03,380
Four of them.

5016
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:03,840
Four of them.

5017
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:04,320
Four of them.

5018
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:05,220
Four of them.

5019
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:06,500
Oh!

5020
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:07,100
He's coming!

5021
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:07,560
He's coming!

5022
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:08,000
He's coming!

5023
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:10,500
It's not safe!

5024
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:11,460
It's not safe!

5025
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:12,780
It's not safe!

5026
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:17,440
That guy just walked in!

5027
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:19,360
It's his home!

5028
02:41:20,060 --> 02:41:20,840
Get down.

5029
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,480
What is all this noise going on?

5030
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,740
And there's a thingy behind you.

5031
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:26,200
Yeah.

5032
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:26,820
Oh.

5033
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:28,260
I think the lizard guys...

5034
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:28,660
Or the...

5035
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:30,420
The worm guys kind of safe.

5036
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:31,640
Doobie guy is friendly.

5037
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:36,540
I think he sees us.

5038
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:37,240
I think he sees us.

5039
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:38,060
I think he sees us.

5040
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:38,900
I think he sees us.

5041
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:43,660
Oh shoot.

5042
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:45,140
Oh no!

5043
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:49,860
Did they both... did they die?

5044
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:51,920
Did they get near me?

5045
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:52,900
Was Doobie okay?

5046
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:56,920
If I die, I die.

5047
02:42:06,890 --> 02:42:08,450
We need the gun!

5048
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:09,610
Oh my god!

5049
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:10,650
We need the gun!

5050
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:12,410
We need the gun!

5051
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:14,030
We need the gun!

5052
02:42:28,220 --> 02:42:29,660
She's trying to save...

5053
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:32,360
I'll just die.

5054
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:37,110
Where are you?

5055
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:53,140
The game has been saved.

5056
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:59,080
Oh my god.

5057
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:02,720
All I wanted to do was...

5058
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:03,900
Free the moon.

5059
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:06,560
I thought we were so close.

5060
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,100
We're gonna do it.

5061
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:07,840
It's possible.

5062
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:09,540
We'll just get to 30 more minutes.

5063
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:11,400
We can do this.

5064
02:43:11,560 --> 02:43:13,220
We can save the moon.

5065
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:15,480
We need the gun.

5066
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:17,600
There's... we need the... there's... there's goo.

5067
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:18,460
There's goo wall.

5068
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:19,800
Okay, okay.

5069
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:20,800
So then we have to...

5070
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:21,600
Wait, can we order it in here?

5071
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:22,160
Yeah, yeah.

5072
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:23,460
I think it was...

5073
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:23,940
We can get it in here.

5074
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:25,120
Yeah, we can get it in here.

5075
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:25,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5076
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:27,920
Alright.

5077
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:29,500
Someone grab the goo gun.

5078
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:31,300
Oh, I got it.

5079
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:33,420
I think... can we enter through here?

5080
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:33,840
Let me see.

5081
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:36,020
I don't think so.

5082
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:40,600
Wait, if you walk pretty close to them, it seems like they can't jump on you, so it's a little easier.

5083
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:41,120
Oh no.

5084
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:42,380
Yeah, it's in this building.

5085
02:43:42,620 --> 02:43:43,240
It's in here.

5086
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:43,520
Okay.

5087
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,820
I have yet to see one electrical board, guys.

5088
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:49,580
I know.

5089
02:43:49,740 --> 02:43:49,960
I know.

5090
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:50,080
Yeah.

5091
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:51,440
It's worth doing.

5092
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:53,140
Yeah.

5093
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:54,240
Oh shoot.

5094
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:00,080
I'm gaming.

5095
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:10,060
What?

5096
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:11,920
What did this lead to?

5097
02:44:12,320 --> 02:44:13,020
Oh shoot.

5098
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:17,620
I found it.

5099
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:21,160
I found it.

5100
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:23,280
I found the...

5101
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:23,600
Wait.

5102
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:25,360
Maybe if we push it out this way.

5103
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:26,760
I found it.

5104
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:28,240
Oh you did.

5105
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,820
Did you shoot the goo?

5106
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:30,880
Yeah, I shot it.

5107
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:31,660
I think we got it.

5108
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:33,480
I think it's easier if we push it through here.

5109
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:38,300
That's probably what the goo gun was for.

5110
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:38,840
Maybe?

5111
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:42,520
Is there an exit?

5112
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:48,770
Oh yeah, there we go!

5113
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:49,650
Yay!

5114
02:44:51,950 --> 02:44:52,190
Yay!

5115
02:44:52,190 --> 02:44:53,030
Push, push, push.

5116
02:44:57,110 --> 02:45:03,310
We can revive her.

5117
02:45:03,470 --> 02:45:03,970
We're right here.

5118
02:45:05,650 --> 02:45:07,790
Don't push it too far past the stairs.

5119
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:15,350
You're back!

5120
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:23,450
This is me watching Mint do her fucking heroic parkour One of the cats jumped on top of me.

5121
02:45:25,710 --> 02:45:28,310
Okay, I remember the deer guys in here.

5122
02:45:28,710 --> 02:45:29,830
It's to our right.

5123
02:45:30,530 --> 02:45:31,430
Wait, this way is faster.

5124
02:45:31,610 --> 02:45:32,150
This way is faster.

5125
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:33,010
Okay.

5126
02:45:33,870 --> 02:45:34,710
Push it, push it, push it.

5127
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:35,310
It's this way.

5128
02:45:35,470 --> 02:45:36,550
It means that he's kind of...

5129
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:38,010
Push it, push it, push it, push it, push it.

5130
02:45:39,810 --> 02:45:40,190
Okay.

5131
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:41,050
In here?

5132
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:42,470
Maybe I see something upstairs.

5133
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:46,070
I hear him.

5134
02:45:47,830 --> 02:45:48,550
Oh, this way?

5135
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:48,930
In here?

5136
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:48,950
Here.

5137
02:45:49,570 --> 02:45:50,170
He's coming.

5138
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:51,990
He's coming?

5139
02:45:52,670 --> 02:45:53,950
Okay, one of us conveyed him.

5140
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:58,090
Wait, you keep pushing because I don't know which way.

5141
02:45:58,490 --> 02:45:59,870
Do I go through the classroom or no?

5142
02:45:59,870 --> 02:46:00,830
You push and then left, yeah.

5143
02:46:01,290 --> 02:46:01,390
Okay.

5144
02:46:01,610 --> 02:46:02,270
Oh, okay, okay.

5145
02:46:03,090 --> 02:46:03,490
Okay, okay.

5146
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:04,310
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

5147
02:46:05,790 --> 02:46:06,670
No, no, no, it's on the...

5148
02:46:06,670 --> 02:46:08,390
Oh, okay, that works too, that works too, that works too.

5149
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:09,290
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5150
02:46:13,250 --> 02:46:15,450
You should be calling him a stupid idiot.

5151
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:18,670
You should try.

5152
02:46:19,090 --> 02:46:20,070
Oh, what'd we get?

5153
02:46:21,030 --> 02:46:22,290
Is this an electrical board?

5154
02:46:22,450 --> 02:46:22,550
I don't know.

5155
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:22,930
Yes, it is.

5156
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:23,870
I got electrical box.

5157
02:46:23,890 --> 02:46:24,950
Oh my God, we got electrical board.

5158
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:25,430
Let's go!

5159
02:46:26,410 --> 02:46:28,430
Wait, is this too the thing though?

5160
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:28,810
Wait.

5161
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:31,890
This is electrical board, not electrical box.

5162
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:32,930
That's what this is.

5163
02:46:33,530 --> 02:46:34,230
It's electrical box.

5164
02:46:34,290 --> 02:46:35,030
Keep right there, guys.

5165
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:35,650
Keep right there.

5166
02:46:35,790 --> 02:46:36,210
We gotta go.

5167
02:46:36,330 --> 02:46:36,730
Goodbye, goodbye.

5168
02:46:39,610 --> 02:46:41,290
Oh, I- I went...

5169
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:41,370
Oh.

5170
02:46:41,730 --> 02:46:42,030
I'm dead.

5171
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:42,630
I'm dead!

5172
02:46:42,770 --> 02:46:43,150
I'm dead!

5173
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:43,670
I'm dead!

5174
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:48,190
I'm not dead, but I dropped the box.

5175
02:46:50,510 --> 02:46:53,510
Um, I'm not dead, but I dropped the box because I thought...

5176
02:46:53,510 --> 02:46:54,030
C'mon, I'm about to...

5177
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:56,510
Um, c'mon, I'm about to...

5178
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:56,650
Oh!

5179
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:57,430
It's for me!

5180
02:46:58,130 --> 02:46:58,890
The box!

5181
02:46:58,990 --> 02:46:59,190
C'mon sot..

5182
02:46:59,190 --> 02:46:59,770
How'd you get it?

5183
02:47:00,330 --> 02:47:00,970
I don't know.

5184
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:11,650
Wait, where do we put this box in?

5185
02:47:12,170 --> 02:47:12,910
Oh, I don't know.

5186
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:16,790
Activate the elev- Oh, the elevator in the industrial building!

5187
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:19,450
Put this boat in one of the industrial buildings.

5188
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:21,490
Wait, how did you get that?

5189
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:23,170
I don't know.

5190
02:47:24,570 --> 02:47:26,450
I dropped it in a dead end!

5191
02:47:32,170 --> 02:47:33,550
No, there was one.

5192
02:47:34,690 --> 02:47:36,750
Wait, so where's the other industrial building?

5193
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:38,550
Oh, oh, oh, yep, yep.

5194
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:40,410
Uh, aren't there three here?

5195
02:47:40,730 --> 02:47:41,290
There's four.

5196
02:47:41,310 --> 02:47:42,710
Yeah, I think there's...

5197
02:47:44,550 --> 02:47:48,890
Uh... Yeah, okay, so we gotta find one of the power supply and put this on.

5198
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:50,050
Okay.

5199
02:47:50,430 --> 02:47:51,930
And one of the industrial buildings.

5200
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:54,750
There's another goo wall!

5201
02:47:54,930 --> 02:47:56,190
There's another goo wall in front of us.

5202
02:47:56,310 --> 02:47:56,830
Oh, no!

5203
02:47:57,370 --> 02:47:57,630
Okay.

5204
02:47:58,150 --> 02:47:58,850
Let's grab the gun.

5205
02:47:59,050 --> 02:47:59,590
Um, where is it?

5206
02:47:59,710 --> 02:47:59,830
Oh.

5207
02:48:00,930 --> 02:48:01,810
Uh... Oh.

5208
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:03,290
Oh, I got it.

5209
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:03,570
Alright.

5210
02:48:04,230 --> 02:48:04,670
Nice.

5211
02:48:05,710 --> 02:48:05,990
Alright.

5212
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:07,290
Find the shovel.

5213
02:48:07,590 --> 02:48:07,870
Where did Nimi go?

5214
02:48:07,870 --> 02:48:08,490
See it right there?

5215
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:09,430
Yeah, I got it.

5216
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:10,530
Where's Nimi?

5217
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:13,830
Oh my gosh, I have to be close to it.

5218
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:16,910
Guys, what happened to Nimi, guys?

5219
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:23,480
I'm in!

5220
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:23,480
I'm in!

5221
02:48:24,940 --> 02:48:26,140
Oh, god!

5222
02:48:36,610 --> 02:48:37,530
Oh my

5223
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:43,270
god, look what you did!

5224
02:48:43,430 --> 02:48:45,670
They're pretty aggressive now, they're pretty aggressive now!

5225
02:48:45,670 --> 02:48:46,470
I'm not gonna lie!

5226
02:48:51,430 --> 02:48:53,510
Oh my god, oh my god, Doobie's alive.

5227
02:48:53,610 --> 02:48:54,290
Doobie's alive.

5228
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:56,610
Doobie's alive.

5229
02:49:00,370 --> 02:49:01,990
Wait, Nimi has the shovel?

5230
02:49:03,790 --> 02:49:04,910
I think Nimi died.

5231
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:06,130
No, wait, I think Nimi is alive.

5232
02:49:06,230 --> 02:49:07,250
Someone said she has the shovel.

5233
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:09,810
Yeah, but maybe she died with the shovel.

5234
02:49:10,090 --> 02:49:10,810
No, she's alive!

5235
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:11,270
She's alive!

5236
02:49:11,630 --> 02:49:12,550
She's alive!

5237
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:16,490
We're all alive!

5238
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:18,250
We're all alive!

5239
02:49:23,890 --> 02:49:26,110
I was drinking my drinks!

5240
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:29,810
Orange tree, orange tree right here!

5241
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:30,390
Orange tree!

5242
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:32,630
Orange tree!

5243
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:34,570
Dig it, dig it!

5244
02:49:34,710 --> 02:49:36,650
There's a couple, there's five of them.

5245
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,210
How long is this game?

5246
02:49:39,470 --> 02:49:40,710
What are these quests?

5247
02:49:41,150 --> 02:49:42,810
I think we might need to do a part two.

5248
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:44,030
What is that?

5249
02:49:44,090 --> 02:49:45,610
Battery for the yellow car?

5250
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:48,050
Is this...is this yellow?

5251
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:51,750
Is this yellow?

5252
02:49:52,210 --> 02:49:54,090
Is this yellow?

5253
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:54,290
Is this yellow?

5254
02:49:54,290 --> 02:49:56,090
There's all good objectives on our screens!

5255
02:49:56,370 --> 02:49:57,830
Why don't they get so heavy to me?

5256
02:49:58,150 --> 02:49:59,630
They're being heavy to me!

5257
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:03,930
Wait, but there's another...wait, Nimi, there's another tree over here!

5258
02:50:04,610 --> 02:50:04,890
Where?

5259
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:05,490
Show me.

5260
02:50:06,190 --> 02:50:08,450
Follow the sound of my voice!

5261
02:50:09,430 --> 02:50:11,830
Oh, guys, do you see the guy in front of us?

5262
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:13,410
Yeah, I see them.

5263
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:17,210
Yellow car, I got two.

5264
02:50:19,130 --> 02:50:19,510
Okay.

5265
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:22,630
What is the yellow car?

5266
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:24,770
What are yellow cars?

5267
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:27,190
It says five-hour game?

5268
02:50:27,590 --> 02:50:28,290
Holy moly.

5269
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:31,130
Okay, we're at the three-hour mark.

5270
02:50:31,270 --> 02:50:32,330
Someone said we're only halfway.

5271
02:50:32,870 --> 02:50:33,550
No way.

5272
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:35,750
We're halfway.

5273
02:50:36,330 --> 02:50:37,070
Is this an orange tree?

5274
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:37,810
Orange tree!

5275
02:50:38,030 --> 02:50:38,630
Where's another one?

5276
02:50:38,970 --> 02:50:41,650
Yeah, I have something to do in like an hour or so.

5277
02:50:55,730 --> 02:50:58,710
Oh my gosh.

5278
02:50:58,830 --> 02:50:59,050
Oh my gosh.

5279
02:50:59,150 --> 02:50:59,810
She's coming after me.

5280
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:07,760
Doobie's over there.

5281
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,000
Doobie found a lever.

5282
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:12,440
This guy is like... Oh, this guy's an asshole.

5283
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:12,940
Yeah.

5284
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:16,200
Okay.

5285
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:16,920
Doobie's alive.

5286
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:18,080
Oh yeah, Doobie's alive.

5287
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:20,400
Doobie found a lever is what she said.

5288
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:27,360
I thought when we find the moon, we like, fire and finish the game.

5289
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:33,520
He's not chasing you.

5290
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:35,760
Well, he was, but...

5291
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:37,660
Alright, we gotta... We gotta get the shovel back.

5292
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:38,880
We gotta get the shovel back.

5293
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:41,240
Shovel.

5294
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:41,980
Shovel time.

5295
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:43,760
These guys are aggressive.

5296
02:51:44,120 --> 02:51:45,420
I'm gonna go this way and check out one.

5297
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:45,740
It's so scary.

5298
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:49,780
Wow!

5299
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:57,720
Come on, Dougie!

5300
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:07,370
Oh, maybe...

5301
02:52:07,370 --> 02:52:07,870
I think we can.

5302
02:52:08,190 --> 02:52:09,470
Probably, I'll go check.

5303
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:14,000
Yeah!

5304
02:52:14,420 --> 02:52:15,540
Is that useful?

5305
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:19,100
We can get the shovel from the vending machine.

5306
02:52:19,880 --> 02:52:20,260
Yeah!

5307
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:21,880
We can get it from the vending machine.

5308
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:22,880
Okay!

5309
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:24,120
Yeah, yeah.

5310
02:52:25,060 --> 02:52:26,220
Should I get it?

5311
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:27,780
Yeah, let's rez, Dougie.

5312
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:29,560
Wait, come back!

5313
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:37,980
Because I thought he was friendly.

5314
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:41,440
Why would you think anything in this game is friendly?

5315
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,300
I don't know!

5316
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:44,180
I just said hi to him!

5317
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:49,440
I'm gonna go be a hero.

5318
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:50,820
Are you gonna get the shovel?

5319
02:52:51,440 --> 02:52:53,540
No, I'm gonna try to drop this thing off.

5320
02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:54,440
Oh!

5321
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:55,800
I don't know where it goes.

5322
02:52:56,720 --> 02:52:59,380
I know, I unlocked the door there.

5323
02:52:59,620 --> 02:52:59,800
Yeah, yeah.

5324
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:00,260
Oh, did you?

5325
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:01,600
Yeah, you can go straight.

5326
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:02,160
There you go.

5327
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:03,800
I'm gonna dig this area.

5328
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:08,390
Did we do this tree already?

5329
02:53:08,410 --> 02:53:09,450
Wait, we need a shovel.

5330
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:11,390
Wait, I got the shovel.

5331
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:11,970
Oh, you did?

5332
02:53:12,110 --> 02:53:12,210
Okay.

5333
02:53:12,470 --> 02:53:12,630
Yeah.

5334
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:13,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5335
02:53:13,930 --> 02:53:14,510
Wait, wait, wait.

5336
02:53:14,550 --> 02:53:15,210
What did Nimi do?

5337
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:16,430
She's gonna go...

5338
02:53:16,430 --> 02:53:17,950
Try and activate the...

5339
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:18,850
The...

5340
02:53:18,850 --> 02:53:19,510
Elevator.

5341
02:53:20,290 --> 02:53:20,390
Oh!

5342
02:53:20,550 --> 02:53:21,190
Yeah, the elevator.

5343
02:53:21,750 --> 02:53:24,870
Okay, as soon as we see it, activate it, we know she did it.

5344
02:53:28,290 --> 02:53:28,730
Whoa!

5345
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:35,380
They're looking at us?

5346
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:36,040
Nah.

5347
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:39,060
I hear them.

5348
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:40,280
There's a second goo door?

5349
02:53:40,480 --> 02:53:40,800
Okay.

5350
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:46,070
I got it.

5351
02:53:46,430 --> 02:53:46,530
Wait.

5352
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:49,010
Currently in use by someone.

5353
02:53:53,940 --> 02:53:54,340
Why?

5354
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:55,540
I can't get it.

5355
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:01,410
I can't get it.

5356
02:54:08,490 --> 02:54:09,290
Oh, wait.

5357
02:54:09,390 --> 02:54:10,330
It might be in the other building.

5358
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:10,870
That's why.

5359
02:54:12,390 --> 02:54:13,090
Hold on!

5360
02:54:13,370 --> 02:54:14,010
I'm getting the...

5361
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:19,480
It's here, I think.

5362
02:54:19,480 --> 02:54:20,900
I think I shot and ran.

5363
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:22,520
Maybe?

5364
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:24,140
Or...

5365
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:24,900
It's gone?

5366
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:27,720
It has a gun.

5367
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:29,500
Yeah, we have it.

5368
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:30,300
Get over here.

5369
02:54:43,390 --> 02:54:43,870
Wait.

5370
02:54:44,530 --> 02:54:45,250
We have to wait.

5371
02:54:45,450 --> 02:54:46,070
Oh, no.

5372
02:54:46,670 --> 02:54:47,430
Oh, no.

5373
02:54:47,730 --> 02:54:48,290
No, no.

5374
02:54:48,390 --> 02:54:49,130
You don't have to wait.

5375
02:54:49,430 --> 02:54:50,010
Just go.

5376
02:54:51,930 --> 02:54:53,970
I like how they're waiting in the elevator.

5377
02:54:55,090 --> 02:54:56,210
Okay, now we can...

5378
02:54:56,210 --> 02:54:57,510
Okay, now we can do it.

5379
02:54:58,050 --> 02:54:58,450
Okay.

5380
02:55:01,450 --> 02:55:02,670
Oh my god, three seconds.

5381
02:55:03,310 --> 02:55:03,570
Oh.

5382
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:05,130
Hi.

5383
02:55:05,370 --> 02:55:05,490
Okay.

5384
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:06,590
Alright, let's go, let's go.

5385
02:55:06,750 --> 02:55:06,850
Okay.

5386
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:09,750
Everybody, my chat lied to me.

5387
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:12,050
What did they say?

5388
02:55:12,150 --> 02:55:13,470
They said that you needed the gun.

5389
02:55:14,610 --> 02:55:15,530
Yeah, she has the gun.

5390
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:16,790
Yeah, I didn't know that.

5391
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:21,090
Alright.

5392
02:55:21,290 --> 02:55:21,610
Okay.

5393
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:21,690
Okay.

5394
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:23,310
Oh.

5395
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:23,650
Oh.

5396
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:25,850
Doobie, I think you're muted again.

5397
02:55:26,890 --> 02:55:27,470
Oh, no.

5398
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:28,650
Oh, yeah.

5399
02:55:28,710 --> 02:55:29,710
We can hear you, we can hear you.

5400
02:55:30,050 --> 02:55:30,610
Yeah, we can hear you.

5401
02:55:30,750 --> 02:55:31,010
Oh, bridge.

5402
02:55:31,870 --> 02:55:32,950
Yeah, there's a bridge here.

5403
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:35,330
There's so much panting everywhere.

5404
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:35,930
Oh my goodness.

5405
02:55:36,250 --> 02:55:36,590
I know.

5406
02:55:36,850 --> 02:55:38,170
All the meow-meows.

5407
02:55:39,130 --> 02:55:40,270
That's what you call them?

5408
02:55:41,110 --> 02:55:42,050
The meow-meows.

5409
02:55:42,050 --> 02:55:43,190
The meow-meows.

5410
02:55:43,210 --> 02:55:45,190
I guess we're getting to the second floor of the annex.

5411
02:55:45,890 --> 02:55:46,270
Oh, nice.

5412
02:55:46,970 --> 02:55:47,570
Oh, wait.

5413
02:55:47,790 --> 02:55:48,430
I'm stuck.

5414
02:55:48,770 --> 02:55:48,890
Wait.

5415
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:50,510
Oh gosh, I'm stuck.

5416
02:55:51,130 --> 02:55:52,170
Oh, okay.

5417
02:55:52,350 --> 02:55:52,990
Oh, I'm good.

5418
02:56:03,190 --> 02:56:03,710
Oh, okay.

5419
02:56:03,710 --> 02:56:04,170
Oh.

5420
02:56:04,470 --> 02:56:04,750
Oh.

5421
02:56:19,210 --> 02:56:19,970
Oh my god.

5422
02:56:20,090 --> 02:56:21,450
That scared the heck out of me.

5423
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:28,760
Oh my god.

5424
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:29,920
Oh my god.

5425
02:56:30,320 --> 02:56:30,960
Oh my god.

5426
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:31,560
We're okay.

5427
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:32,880
No, we're not.

5428
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:33,640
We're not okay.

5429
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:34,180
We're not.

5430
02:56:42,250 --> 02:56:44,010
How many times has it been?

5431
02:56:45,930 --> 02:56:47,970
I don't know if you've said it yet.

5432
02:56:48,210 --> 02:56:49,410
I can't stop.

5433
02:56:50,690 --> 02:56:51,370
That's me.

5434
02:56:51,370 --> 02:56:54,230
Okay, we need to find a corpse.

5435
02:56:54,310 --> 02:56:54,610
Oh, wait.

5436
02:56:55,090 --> 02:56:55,750
They're alive.

5437
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:56,250
They're alive.

5438
02:56:56,690 --> 02:56:57,910
We need a fresh corpse.

5439
02:56:58,210 --> 02:56:58,610
Wait, wait.

5440
02:56:58,690 --> 02:56:59,250
Is it alive?

5441
02:56:59,790 --> 02:57:00,030
No.

5442
02:57:00,630 --> 02:57:01,390
No, she died.

5443
02:57:01,850 --> 02:57:02,770
Oh, let's get her back.

5444
02:57:03,550 --> 02:57:04,710
Yeah, get me back.

5445
02:57:05,570 --> 02:57:06,710
We can get her back, yeah.

5446
02:57:08,590 --> 02:57:08,910
Hello.

5447
02:57:08,910 --> 02:57:09,590
Welcome back.

5448
02:57:09,610 --> 02:57:12,050
I got got by an eyeball, so be careful.

5449
02:57:12,990 --> 02:57:13,230
Okay.

5450
02:57:13,630 --> 02:57:14,470
Wait, what's the...

5451
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:16,290
Wait, the electrical box is here?

5452
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:19,290
Why don't you want to place a fresh astronaut corpse here?

5453
02:57:19,650 --> 02:57:20,490
Well, we can do that.

5454
02:57:20,490 --> 02:57:20,630
Oh.

5455
02:57:21,190 --> 02:57:21,890
That could've...

5456
02:57:21,890 --> 02:57:22,990
Where'd you have to get the...

5457
02:57:22,990 --> 02:57:23,870
It could've been me.

5458
02:57:23,890 --> 02:57:24,150
It could've been me.

5459
02:57:25,290 --> 02:57:27,370
Oh, like you have to die to it?

5460
02:57:27,810 --> 02:57:28,990
No, I don't think so.

5461
02:57:29,170 --> 02:57:29,750
I don't think so.

5462
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:30,730
You've been dying right here.

5463
02:57:30,810 --> 02:57:31,250
Oh my god.

5464
02:57:31,350 --> 02:57:32,490
Eyeball, eyeball, eyeball!

5465
02:57:32,730 --> 02:57:33,330
Eyeball, eyeball, eyeball.

5466
02:57:38,650 --> 02:57:40,410
I warned her about the eyeball.

5467
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:45,700
Oh gosh, I'm stuck.

5468
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:52,660
I was going to go into the hole.

5469
02:57:59,650 --> 02:58:00,690
Go near me.

5470
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:03,970
I was going into the hole.

5471
02:58:16,240 --> 02:58:17,000
Holy...

5472
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,560
Gaming tap here.

5473
02:58:29,710 --> 02:58:30,790
I'm lost.

5474
02:58:31,370 --> 02:58:31,930
Uh oh.

5475
02:58:35,230 --> 02:58:36,310
I don't know.

5476
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:37,170
I don't know.

5477
02:58:37,390 --> 02:58:39,410
I think maybe Tab has accessed the map.

5478
02:58:39,410 --> 02:58:40,210
Cause I have no idea.

5479
02:58:40,730 --> 02:58:41,990
I think it's Tab.

5480
02:58:46,180 --> 02:58:47,120
Was there a body?

5481
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:48,780
Like a fresh one?

5482
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:51,820
Us.

5483
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:53,560
Can I let him in by opening the door?

5484
02:58:54,760 --> 02:58:55,120
Oh!

5485
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:58,280
Oh, that was close.

5486
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:01,900
It's like the other guy, but he's quiet.

5487
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:06,740
I can only hear them very spangly.

5488
02:59:06,840 --> 02:59:07,340
They're like...

5489
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:10,900
Is that a fresh body?

5490
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:11,680
Oh no, wait.

5491
02:59:11,780 --> 02:59:12,820
That sounds...

5492
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:14,760
Oh,

5493
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:19,540
it's the safe one.

5494
02:59:22,880 --> 02:59:23,860
Oh my god!

5495
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:25,500
You were gaming!

5496
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:26,600
You were gaming!

5497
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:28,240
You were gaming!

5498
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:29,080
You were gaming so hard!

5499
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:30,400
Guys, guys, guys, guys, watch out.

5500
02:59:30,460 --> 02:59:30,820
Be careful.

5501
02:59:33,720 --> 02:59:34,320
Eyeball.

5502
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:36,880
I think that eyeball comes from out here, actually.

5503
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:39,820
Uh oh.

5504
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:40,600
No!

5505
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:41,660
Shot?

5506
02:59:42,060 --> 02:59:42,740
No way.

5507
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:45,520
Oh my gosh, I'm stuck.

5508
03:00:00,550 --> 03:00:02,210
Oh my gosh.

5509
03:00:02,770 --> 03:00:03,710
Yeah, no problem.

5510
03:00:03,710 --> 03:00:04,430
She was...

5511
03:00:04,430 --> 03:00:04,730
Oh!

5512
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:08,250
Okay.

5513
03:00:08,850 --> 03:00:11,090
Why is he up here now?

5514
03:00:12,030 --> 03:00:12,530
Okay.

5515
03:00:13,230 --> 03:00:14,190
Guys, come back.

5516
03:00:14,270 --> 03:00:15,330
Oh yeah, we'll come back.

5517
03:00:15,550 --> 03:00:15,710
Okay.

5518
03:00:16,110 --> 03:00:16,210
Oh.

5519
03:00:16,830 --> 03:00:18,930
The other guy was a pain in the ass.

5520
03:00:19,010 --> 03:00:19,690
Not gonna lie.

5521
03:00:20,210 --> 03:00:21,390
The guy with the sword?

5522
03:00:21,850 --> 03:00:22,370
Yeah.

5523
03:00:24,070 --> 03:00:24,990
Here he comes.

5524
03:00:27,830 --> 03:00:28,350
Oh.

5525
03:00:29,810 --> 03:00:30,350
Oh no.

5526
03:00:36,350 --> 03:00:37,630
I thought he was.

5527
03:00:37,630 --> 03:00:37,770
No!

5528
03:00:37,770 --> 03:00:37,830
Oh no.

5529
03:00:37,830 --> 03:00:39,110
She's gaming wh...

5530
03:00:40,690 --> 03:00:42,950
She doesn't know, he doesn't know...

5531
03:00:51,670 --> 03:00:52,310
Why?!

5532
03:00:54,770 --> 03:00:55,530
Wow.

5533
03:00:55,530 --> 03:00:57,050
Is that the trick?

5534
03:00:57,830 --> 03:00:59,630
Yeah, that's the trick.

5535
03:01:02,510 --> 03:01:03,270
Emoto!

5536
03:01:03,690 --> 03:01:04,990
Oh my gosh, this is a good one.

5537
03:01:06,670 --> 03:01:08,070
He won't get me!

5538
03:01:08,270 --> 03:01:09,050
I'm dancing!

5539
03:01:13,090 --> 03:01:13,850
Ah!

5540
03:01:14,310 --> 03:01:16,350
He didn't like my moves!

5541
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:21,050
What is that?

5542
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:23,790
Oh, then we got got too.

5543
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:31,200
Spin to assert dominance!

5544
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:36,780
It's okay.

5545
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:38,240
I'm not a strong dancer.

5546
03:01:38,380 --> 03:01:39,080
Oh my god, there's so much stuff.

5547
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:41,260
Wait, it's just the same caps that I found before.

5548
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:41,520
Okay.

5549
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:46,080
Well, first we need to find a fresh corpse.

5550
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,460
Guys, I should have a...

5551
03:01:48,460 --> 03:01:51,280
...appointment with my throat doctor soon, hopefully.

5552
03:01:52,280 --> 03:01:55,780
For now, I chugga chugga these...

5553
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:57,200
...sirups.

5554
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:00,920
To

5555
03:02:07,090 --> 03:02:07,590
be...

5556
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:09,850
To be's famous last words.

5557
03:02:10,210 --> 03:02:11,750
To castle?

5558
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:17,430
Guys, I think it's the corpse that's like shown in the little hole.

5559
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:18,830
And downstairs?

5560
03:02:19,470 --> 03:02:20,390
Yeah, I think so.

5561
03:02:21,490 --> 03:02:21,830
Oh!

5562
03:02:22,290 --> 03:02:22,950
Should we go downstairs?

5563
03:02:23,890 --> 03:02:24,250
Maybe.

5564
03:02:24,390 --> 03:02:25,410
There's also other stairs.

5565
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:27,510
I don't know which one is the right stairs.

5566
03:02:27,530 --> 03:02:28,910
It could maybe drop down.

5567
03:02:29,570 --> 03:02:30,010
I don't know.

5568
03:02:30,110 --> 03:02:30,830
This guy sucks.

5569
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:31,770
The sword guy.

5570
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:32,090
Oh, it's locked.

5571
03:02:32,390 --> 03:02:33,530
Wait, I know a way to get down.

5572
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:34,110
I saw it.

5573
03:02:34,230 --> 03:02:34,370
Oh!

5574
03:02:34,370 --> 03:02:35,590
It's not locked.

5575
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:36,610
It's fresh here.

5576
03:02:37,550 --> 03:02:38,090
No.

5577
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:43,240
Yeah, cuz we watched that guy die, remember?

5578
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:44,420
Oh, yeah!

5579
03:02:44,780 --> 03:02:45,000
Oh!

5580
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:46,780
So he's fresh.

5581
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:48,000
Oh!

5582
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:48,240
Yeah!

5583
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:49,020
Oh!

5584
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:51,640
Oh my god.

5585
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:53,240
He's ragdoll.

5586
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:54,290
Holy ragdoll.

5587
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:56,540
Holy ragdoll.

5588
03:02:56,540 --> 03:02:57,220
First, okay, we...

5589
03:02:57,220 --> 03:02:57,940
Woo!

5590
03:03:00,300 --> 03:03:01,360
Let's stop there.

5591
03:03:03,440 --> 03:03:04,240
Turn around.

5592
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:04,680
Where are we?

5593
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:05,200
Oh, okay.

5594
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:06,320
Right there, right there.

5595
03:03:09,780 --> 03:03:10,640
Yeah, right there.

5596
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:12,060
Oh!

5597
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:14,020
Oh, we just made...

5598
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:15,500
We made a new worm.

5599
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:15,560
Oh, freaky!

5600
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:16,960
Oh, Dopey!

5601
03:03:22,580 --> 03:03:23,540
Let's go save.

5602
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:26,040
Her sacrifice is not in vain.

5603
03:03:30,060 --> 03:03:30,980
Oh, what the fu...

5604
03:03:37,730 --> 03:03:38,490
Oh, shoot.

5605
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,370
Come on, man.

5606
03:03:39,550 --> 03:03:39,690
No!

5607
03:03:49,050 --> 03:03:50,590
I wish I weren't!

5608
03:04:02,570 --> 03:04:03,770
Oh, I'm so dead.

5609
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:05,230
I'm dead.

5610
03:04:08,480 --> 03:04:09,220
Oh, shoot!

5611
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:10,780
I'm juking him!

5612
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:11,860
I'm juking him!

5613
03:04:11,980 --> 03:04:12,240
Come on!

5614
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:13,540
Stop!

5615
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:14,160
Ah, oh, oh!

5616
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:15,000
Oh, you're dead!

5617
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,200
Oh, you're dead!

5618
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:17,660
Oh, it's okay, Jesus!

5619
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:20,900
No!

5620
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:21,160
Oh, no!

5621
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:25,890
Are you alive?

5622
03:04:26,730 --> 03:04:28,190
No, I'm not dead!

5623
03:04:28,650 --> 03:04:29,230
No!

5624
03:04:30,510 --> 03:04:31,650
That's not what I asked!

5625
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:44,480
Oh, no!

5626
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:48,140
Oh, no!

5627
03:04:53,210 --> 03:04:54,930
Oh, I got so trapped, yeah.

5628
03:04:57,050 --> 03:04:58,030
Are you alive?

5629
03:04:58,450 --> 03:04:58,770
Nope.

5630
03:05:00,710 --> 03:05:02,990
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

5631
03:05:03,270 --> 03:05:03,270
Yeah.

5632
03:05:04,770 --> 03:05:05,430
Push, push.

5633
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:06,750
Wait, the capsule, the capsule.

5634
03:05:07,230 --> 03:05:08,010
Push, push, push.

5635
03:05:08,210 --> 03:05:08,750
Push, push, push, push.

5636
03:05:09,710 --> 03:05:10,590
Okay, go, go.

5637
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:11,350
Okay, I'll lead the way.

5638
03:05:11,430 --> 03:05:12,070
This way, this way.

5639
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:14,630
It's in a corner.

5640
03:05:15,330 --> 03:05:16,930
I think the guy's still downstairs.

5641
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:18,050
No, no, he's upstairs.

5642
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:19,110
He's by the safe point.

5643
03:05:19,110 --> 03:05:19,990
He's by the safe point.

5644
03:05:20,030 --> 03:05:20,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5645
03:05:20,790 --> 03:05:22,470
He's walking over to the left.

5646
03:05:24,910 --> 03:05:25,830
I'm pushing.

5647
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:28,970
Oh, the eyeball.

5648
03:05:30,750 --> 03:05:32,230
Eyeball, watch out.

5649
03:05:44,390 --> 03:05:45,070
Oh.

5650
03:05:55,940 --> 03:05:57,680
Oh, shoot.

5651
03:06:01,680 --> 03:06:02,520
It's okay.

5652
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:04,680
I'll die.

5653
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:09,300
We're not.

5654
03:06:14,370 --> 03:06:15,110
Oh, shoot!

5655
03:06:16,790 --> 03:06:17,390
Oh, I did!

5656
03:06:29,070 --> 03:06:29,950
Now, Doobie!

5657
03:06:30,870 --> 03:06:31,310
Doobie!

5658
03:06:33,720 --> 03:06:35,200
You can juke this guy, which is...

5659
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:36,060
I'll distract the guy, I guess.

5660
03:06:36,620 --> 03:06:37,980
No, no, don't distract him.

5661
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:40,080
Doobie, don't distract him.

5662
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:41,400
Doobie, don't distract him.

5663
03:06:41,400 --> 03:06:42,980
Doobie, doobie, don't distract him.

5664
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:51,360
Why does she think we're alive?

5665
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:52,840
Please!

5666
03:06:56,900 --> 03:06:59,240
Oh, this is what... Oh, it's in like a little cubby.

5667
03:07:01,260 --> 03:07:01,740
Oh,

5668
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:05,380
he's nasty.

5669
03:07:17,060 --> 03:07:18,140
Get eyeballed.

5670
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:21,360
Bad timing.

5671
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:22,980
That was such bad timing.

5672
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:30,640
I was such... Okay, I... I... I was like, oh, Doobie's so smart, and then you got ran over by the eye.

5673
03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:30,760
I was like...

5674
03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:33,240
Doobie!

5675
03:07:33,260 --> 03:07:33,820
Doobie, no!

5676
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:34,440
Fine!

5677
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:35,300
Fine, fine, fine!

5678
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:36,780
Okay, I'll distract him, I'll distract him.

5679
03:07:36,880 --> 03:07:37,960
Yeah, what was distract him?

5680
03:07:39,700 --> 03:07:40,420
What is...

5681
03:07:41,660 --> 03:07:42,800
Great distraction, Doobie!

5682
03:07:45,080 --> 03:07:51,080
Oh my god, I got a second hand cut by Doki's stupid body.

5683
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:52,840
Are you kidding me?

5684
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:54,780
Thanks a lot, Doki.

5685
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:57,480
You couldn't just... You couldn't just die on your own.

5686
03:08:00,460 --> 03:08:02,600
I'll wait for the eyeball to pass.

5687
03:08:04,880 --> 03:08:05,780
There it is.

5688
03:08:06,140 --> 03:08:08,860
Doki obstructs even in death, it's true.

5689
03:08:08,860 --> 03:08:08,900
Yeah.

5690
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:12,500
Body blocked.

5691
03:08:13,380 --> 03:08:15,120
It's like she wants me or something.

5692
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:17,900
Gosh.

5693
03:08:18,400 --> 03:08:20,060
Oh no, oh no, no.

5694
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:22,360
Oh my god, that was so close.

5695
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:28,380
I spoke too soon.

5696
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:36,800
Oh my god, this part is so tough.

5697
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:38,320
It is.

5698
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:39,760
Okay, he's still downstairs.

5699
03:08:40,420 --> 03:08:42,180
I feel like there's gonna be a way to cheese it.

5700
03:08:42,980 --> 03:08:44,600
Are we sure he's downstairs?

5701
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,060
How do we push it out of the corner?

5702
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:52,720
Oh, oh, you can.

5703
03:08:53,240 --> 03:08:53,340
Oh.

5704
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:56,660
Oh, there he is.

5705
03:08:56,780 --> 03:08:57,220
I see him.

5706
03:09:03,400 --> 03:09:04,780
He was by the save point.

5707
03:09:04,780 --> 03:09:04,940
Damn it.

5708
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:08,400
Where are we going?

5709
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:09,420
I don't know.

5710
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:11,920
But I saw it last over here.

5711
03:09:14,140 --> 03:09:16,060
And the worm...

5712
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:17,460
Nimi, watch out!

5713
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:18,980
Oh.

5714
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,540
I think she got caught by something.

5715
03:09:26,720 --> 03:09:27,780
Bring it downstairs?

5716
03:09:28,460 --> 03:09:29,440
Is this downstairs?

5717
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:31,940
We're going to bring us back downstairs.

5718
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:33,060
Here you have.

5719
03:09:40,140 --> 03:09:41,040
I'm lost.

5720
03:09:41,440 --> 03:09:42,140
I'm scared.

5721
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:47,140
Where do I go?

5722
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:48,320
You got this.

5723
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:52,170
You got this.

5724
03:09:52,590 --> 03:09:52,630
Here?

5725
03:09:53,290 --> 03:09:53,810
Maybe?

5726
03:09:54,810 --> 03:09:55,710
Red line?

5727
03:09:55,930 --> 03:09:56,910
Okay, I'll follow red line.

5728
03:09:59,030 --> 03:09:59,550
Wait.

5729
03:09:59,790 --> 03:10:00,730
Now how do I get to it?

5730
03:10:01,770 --> 03:10:01,950
Ugh.

5731
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:03,450
So in here?

5732
03:10:04,330 --> 03:10:05,250
I'll bring it in here?

5733
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:19,000
I hear...

5734
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:19,700
panting.

5735
03:10:21,020 --> 03:10:21,880
Oh, I see it!

5736
03:10:21,940 --> 03:10:22,360
I see it!

5737
03:10:33,740 --> 03:10:35,100
Oh, we need one more though.

5738
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:37,300
What is this?

5739
03:10:37,460 --> 03:10:38,480
Oh, I can just sit down.

5740
03:10:38,660 --> 03:10:39,460
I can just take it easy.

5741
03:10:41,720 --> 03:10:43,080
There's one more right here.

5742
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:44,160
What?

5743
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:47,140
What?

5744
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:48,300
Did we see another one?

5745
03:10:49,280 --> 03:10:51,000
I think there's another one over here too.

5746
03:10:52,040 --> 03:10:53,420
Yeah, there's two more!

5747
03:11:02,150 --> 03:11:03,470
We need two more!

5748
03:11:16,940 --> 03:11:17,800
How did we say?

5749
03:11:17,880 --> 03:11:19,160
Oh, she's right underneath us.

5750
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:20,080
I guess that's why.

5751
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:21,620
Oh, I said okay.

5752
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:22,340
I looped him.

5753
03:11:22,500 --> 03:11:22,640
Okay.

5754
03:11:22,900 --> 03:11:23,480
He's still downstairs.

5755
03:11:23,760 --> 03:11:25,120
Wait, but there's only...

5756
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:26,660
There's two more that we need.

5757
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:28,580
Where's the other two?

5758
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:29,360
I don't know.

5759
03:11:29,580 --> 03:11:29,960
I saw...

5760
03:11:30,900 --> 03:11:31,800
He's not downstairs.

5761
03:11:32,220 --> 03:11:32,740
I saw where the other one is.

5762
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:33,420
I saw one.

5763
03:11:33,620 --> 03:11:34,940
Wait, he's not downstairs anymore?

5764
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:36,720
No, he just chased after us.

5765
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:37,720
Oh.

5766
03:11:39,260 --> 03:11:40,480
Oh, there he is.

5767
03:11:41,140 --> 03:11:43,240
Where are the other two capsules?

5768
03:11:44,620 --> 03:11:45,780
He's coming downstairs!

5769
03:11:46,480 --> 03:11:47,520
No, he's coming upstairs.

5770
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:48,280
Oh, shoot.

5771
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:49,040
Oh.

5772
03:11:49,620 --> 03:11:50,020
Oh.

5773
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:55,960
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

5774
03:11:56,180 --> 03:11:57,740
Oh, my god.

5775
03:11:58,820 --> 03:11:59,920
Okay, what's over here?

5776
03:12:00,500 --> 03:12:01,600
Any more capsules?

5777
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:03,480
Maybe there's a...

5778
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,820
Oh, it's this area!

5779
03:12:05,140 --> 03:12:05,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5780
03:12:06,320 --> 03:12:07,220
It's the third floor!

5781
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:08,280
What?

5782
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:09,440
I don't remember.

5783
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:12,260
Any capsules around here?

5784
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:14,540
Oh, are those downstairs?

5785
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:19,080
Wait, are they alive?

5786
03:12:19,920 --> 03:12:20,700
We could try.

5787
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:22,820
They're in the hallway.

5788
03:12:23,020 --> 03:12:23,220
Oh.

5789
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:24,480
I saw...

5790
03:12:24,480 --> 03:12:25,680
There's one on this floor.

5791
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:27,440
There's a door that was...

5792
03:12:27,440 --> 03:12:28,020
Oh, okay.

5793
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:30,280
Okay, so I'll try and lead the other...

5794
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:31,740
We'll try and lead them back.

5795
03:12:31,740 --> 03:12:32,800
Oh, gosh, I can't see.

5796
03:12:33,080 --> 03:12:34,360
Why is it so dark all of a sudden?

5797
03:12:40,390 --> 03:12:41,170
I didn't...

5798
03:12:41,170 --> 03:12:41,570
He's right here.

5799
03:12:53,680 --> 03:12:54,380
Oh, my god.

5800
03:12:54,500 --> 03:12:54,940
Are you kidding me?

5801
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:59,220
Oh, my god.

5802
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:02,740
Don't keep our daylight with that looping tech.

5803
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:07,660
Oh, my god.

5804
03:13:07,780 --> 03:13:10,220
I can't loop because I'm being chased by Mimi.

5805
03:13:16,710 --> 03:13:17,310
Okay.

5806
03:13:19,190 --> 03:13:20,470
Doobie's looking for the...

5807
03:13:22,950 --> 03:13:24,450
Oh, Doki died.

5808
03:13:24,770 --> 03:13:25,790
Nice looping tech.

5809
03:13:25,790 --> 03:13:26,870
Good job, Doki.

5810
03:13:26,910 --> 03:13:27,870
Nice looping tech.

5811
03:13:29,690 --> 03:13:31,010
He jumped up here.

5812
03:13:31,170 --> 03:13:31,510
Come on.

5813
03:13:32,030 --> 03:13:33,190
Oh, no.

5814
03:13:34,350 --> 03:13:34,890
This guy...

5815
03:13:34,890 --> 03:13:36,110
This is so tough.

5816
03:13:36,590 --> 03:13:37,410
Holy moly.

5817
03:13:38,790 --> 03:13:41,630
Yeah, it does have a difficulty spike, right?

5818
03:13:43,450 --> 03:13:44,010
Sheesh.

5819
03:13:44,730 --> 03:13:45,790
We need dynamite.

5820
03:13:46,690 --> 03:13:47,330
No kidding?

5821
03:13:49,870 --> 03:13:50,510
No kidding?

5822
03:13:50,510 --> 03:13:50,670
Not it.

5823
03:13:56,790 --> 03:13:57,990
Not three, they're gone.

5824
03:13:58,070 --> 03:13:59,490
They've been turned into some kind of giant worm.

5825
03:13:59,630 --> 03:14:00,590
It's not crawling across the floor.

5826
03:14:00,690 --> 03:14:01,010
It's a nightmare.

5827
03:14:01,850 --> 03:14:03,570
Get us out of here before it's too late.

5828
03:14:03,830 --> 03:14:04,150
Oh.

5829
03:14:04,870 --> 03:14:05,190
Oh.

5830
03:14:05,290 --> 03:14:05,770
Oh, I thought you were...

5831
03:14:05,770 --> 03:14:06,890
I thought it was going to turn down here.

5832
03:14:06,890 --> 03:14:07,830
This squad is in panic.

5833
03:14:07,990 --> 03:14:08,590
No one would just say it's not...

5834
03:14:08,590 --> 03:14:10,250
I don't think I'm...

5835
03:14:10,250 --> 03:14:10,490
Stop.

5836
03:14:10,990 --> 03:14:11,610
Ah, ah.

5837
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:17,360
Yeah.

5838
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:18,220
Oh.

5839
03:14:18,940 --> 03:14:19,100
Oh.

5840
03:14:19,860 --> 03:14:20,260
Doobie.

5841
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:21,860
Ah,

5842
03:14:28,740 --> 03:14:29,380
true one.

5843
03:14:30,460 --> 03:14:31,360
Make them go.

5844
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:33,420
Oh, oh, oh.

5845
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:34,680
Oh, you can crawl through there.

5846
03:14:34,680 --> 03:14:36,680
They're gonna make them go.

5847
03:14:37,300 --> 03:14:38,800
Oh, oh, oh.

5848
03:14:47,050 --> 03:14:49,630
I can't sing at all, but I can hear the...

5849
03:14:50,850 --> 03:14:51,530
Yay!

5850
03:14:52,610 --> 03:14:53,790
Yay, guys.

5851
03:14:54,410 --> 03:14:55,150
Guys, I...

5852
03:14:55,150 --> 03:14:57,430
Maybe we should save this for part two.

5853
03:14:57,970 --> 03:14:58,450
Yeah.

5854
03:14:58,450 --> 03:14:59,470
Yeah, I think so.

5855
03:15:00,190 --> 03:15:00,870
We'll...

5856
03:15:00,870 --> 03:15:02,770
We'll be back something...

5857
03:15:04,630 --> 03:15:04,970
Yes.

5858
03:15:07,710 --> 03:15:08,390
We...

5859
03:15:08,390 --> 03:15:09,450
This is like...

5860
03:15:09,450 --> 03:15:09,850
3-0.

5861
03:15:09,850 --> 03:15:12,810
We keep dying.

5862
03:15:13,110 --> 03:15:14,030
We keep coming back.

5863
03:15:14,130 --> 03:15:14,690
I know.

5864
03:15:15,390 --> 03:15:18,190
We cloned ourselves so many times.

5865
03:15:19,390 --> 03:15:20,070
I know.

5866
03:15:20,630 --> 03:15:23,230
We're Mickey 500 at this point.

5867
03:15:23,910 --> 03:15:25,690
We're Mickey 500.

5868
03:15:27,670 --> 03:15:29,450
Oh, TV, you're muted, I think.

5869
03:15:30,270 --> 03:15:30,810
Oh, hello.

5870
03:15:31,030 --> 03:15:31,190
Sorry.

5871
03:15:31,410 --> 03:15:31,570
Hello.

5872
03:15:32,470 --> 03:15:32,970
You're good.

5873
03:15:33,110 --> 03:15:33,550
Hello.

5874
03:15:34,150 --> 03:15:34,650
Okay.

5875
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:37,430
I'm down to do a part two of this.

5876
03:15:37,830 --> 03:15:37,850
Me too.

5877
03:15:37,870 --> 03:15:38,290
Yeah.

5878
03:15:38,290 --> 03:15:39,390
We're halfway, apparently.

5879
03:15:39,590 --> 03:15:40,190
We're halfway.

5880
03:15:40,650 --> 03:15:42,210
I wanna release the moon!

5881
03:15:42,710 --> 03:15:43,350
The moon!

5882
03:15:44,390 --> 03:15:44,450
Yeah!

5883
03:15:44,730 --> 03:15:44,910
We gotta...

5884
03:15:44,910 --> 03:15:45,050
Yeah!

5885
03:15:45,050 --> 03:15:46,590
We gotta save the moon!

5886
03:15:46,590 --> 03:15:47,070
We gotta save the moon!

5887
03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:52,400
Yeah!

5888
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:55,520
Thank you for joining me in this collab, guys!

5889
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:56,320
Thank you.

5890
03:15:56,540 --> 03:15:56,880
Thank you!

5891
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,120
It was fun.

5892
03:15:58,320 --> 03:15:58,900
A lot of fun.

5893
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:00,060
Yeah!

5894
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:02,020
We'll get them next time.

5895
03:16:02,180 --> 03:16:04,360
We'll get them next time, boys.

5896
03:16:05,740 --> 03:16:07,900
Wait, what was the Brickdancing one again?

5897
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:09,520
Oh, I got it, that's three.

5898
03:16:10,040 --> 03:16:10,100
Three?

5899
03:16:15,060 --> 03:16:18,320
I'm gonna hear these sound effects in my dreams tonight.

5900
03:16:29,940 --> 03:16:31,460
Thank you for your help.

5901
03:16:31,460 --> 03:16:32,000
Thank you everyone!

5902
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:34,440
Thank you everyone for joining us!

5903
03:16:34,580 --> 03:16:34,880
Yeah!

5904
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:38,660
I had a great time with green and yellow today.

5905
03:16:38,660 --> 03:16:39,100
Yeah!

5906
03:16:39,100 --> 03:16:39,480
Yeah!

5907
03:16:39,720 --> 03:16:39,720
Yeah!

5908
03:16:40,660 --> 03:16:40,760
Yeah!

5909
03:16:44,940 --> 03:16:45,520
That was great.

5910
03:16:45,860 --> 03:16:48,680
Alright, we'll figure out when to play part two.

5911
03:16:49,220 --> 03:16:50,080
Sometime, yeah.

5912
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,200
Yeah, thank you guys.

5913
03:16:52,460 --> 03:16:53,020
Thank you guys!

5914
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:54,140
Thank you!

5915
03:16:54,520 --> 03:16:54,920
Alright!

5916
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:57,700
Alright, I'll see you guys later!

5917
03:16:58,480 --> 03:17:00,300
We'll get to move next time!

5918
03:17:00,320 --> 03:17:00,400
Yeah!

5919
03:17:00,400 --> 03:17:01,000
Yeah, me too!

5920
03:17:01,660 --> 03:17:03,080
Alright, I'll see you guys!

5921
03:17:03,380 --> 03:17:03,820
Bye bye!

5922
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:05,840
Bye bye!

5923
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:11,440
Save?

5924
03:17:11,440 --> 03:17:11,660
Save?

5925
03:17:11,740 --> 03:17:12,160
Oh.

5926
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:14,440
Save?

5927
03:17:14,840 --> 03:17:15,180
What?

5928
03:17:15,180 --> 03:17:16,520
What are you...

5929
03:17:16,520 --> 03:17:17,600
What is this?

5930
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:20,940
We need to have out, you can't hear anymore.

5931
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:21,300
Yeah!

5932
03:17:22,060 --> 03:17:23,660
Oh, Stokie should save, because she's the host.

5933
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:24,220
Thank you guys for watching!

5934
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:25,820
Thank you guys for watching!

5935
03:17:25,820 --> 03:17:26,060
Thank you guys for watching!

5936
03:17:26,380 --> 03:17:27,960
Wait, wait, wait, we're 15 seconds.

5937
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:29,900
Oh yeah, save, save.

5938
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:30,600
We're on mute.

5939
03:17:31,140 --> 03:17:33,220
I hope the host can do it again.

5940
03:17:33,380 --> 03:17:34,100
It's still loosened.

5941
03:17:34,240 --> 03:17:34,720
Hold on.

5942
03:17:36,100 --> 03:17:37,100
No, we can't hear anything.

5943
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:37,820
Oh!

5944
03:17:38,920 --> 03:17:40,300
Gosh, these sound effects.

5945
03:17:40,580 --> 03:17:41,840
Get me out of this hell.

5946
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:42,520
Ta-da!

5947
03:17:42,800 --> 03:17:43,100
Okay!

5948
03:17:43,740 --> 03:17:44,120
Peace!

5949
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:44,880
Bye bye!

5950
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:44,960
Bye!

5951
03:17:45,560 --> 03:17:45,980
Bye!

5952
03:17:51,910 --> 03:17:53,930
I guess if you exit, it's fine.

5953
03:17:54,890 --> 03:17:56,110
I'm kinda scared.

5954
03:17:57,710 --> 03:17:58,810
Kinda sca- Oh!

5955
03:17:59,270 --> 03:18:00,030
Don't see that.

5956
03:18:00,570 --> 03:18:00,870
Oops.

5957
03:18:01,130 --> 03:18:02,150
I think I just...

5958
03:18:02,150 --> 03:18:02,950
messed everything up.

5959
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:04,990
Um...

5960
03:18:04,990 --> 03:18:06,710
Well guys, I have a secret to tell you.

5961
03:18:07,850 --> 03:18:09,730
I never was in a space suit.

5962
03:18:11,410 --> 03:18:14,170
I never was in a space suit to begin with.

5963
03:18:17,710 --> 03:18:18,230
I...

5964
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:19,790
I don't know if you can tell.

5965
03:18:21,210 --> 03:18:24,280
I wasn't lying.

5966
03:18:24,560 --> 03:18:25,560
I was role-playing.

5967
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:28,480
Love seeing the green and yellow.

5968
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:29,760
Yay.

5969
03:18:31,480 --> 03:18:32,380
We'll be today.

5970
03:18:35,960 --> 03:18:37,960
Good luck with your throat doctor appointment.

5971
03:18:38,180 --> 03:18:39,160
Yeah, I had my...

5972
03:18:39,160 --> 03:18:39,800
I had...

5973
03:18:40,260 --> 03:18:42,420
My regular doctor appointment today.

5974
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:44,000
And I was like, Hello!

5975
03:18:44,740 --> 03:18:45,140
Um...

5976
03:18:45,140 --> 03:18:46,960
First of all, they were like 30 minutes late.

5977
03:18:47,140 --> 03:18:49,100
And so I was like, Well, this is not good.

5978
03:18:49,100 --> 03:18:50,480
I hope I can make it to my collab.

5979
03:18:50,880 --> 03:18:52,160
And then they were like...

5980
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:53,300
I was like, Hello!

5981
03:18:53,480 --> 03:18:55,340
I want to go to the throat doctor.

5982
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:57,020
And I talk a lot.

5983
03:18:57,640 --> 03:18:58,040
And...

5984
03:18:58,040 --> 03:18:58,560
Um...

5985
03:18:58,560 --> 03:18:59,340
Throat hurt!

5986
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:01,580
And they were like, Okay.

5987
03:19:01,820 --> 03:19:03,360
And it literally lasts...

5988
03:19:03,360 --> 03:19:04,700
Probably four minutes.

5989
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:05,320
Not even.

5990
03:19:05,520 --> 03:19:06,060
Three minutes.

5991
03:19:06,120 --> 03:19:07,500
Me being like, Can I go?

5992
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:11,660
She yaps.

5993
03:19:11,980 --> 03:19:12,720
Your honor.

5994
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:15,420
She yaps.

5995
03:19:15,620 --> 03:19:15,860
Your honor.

5996
03:19:16,100 --> 03:19:17,160
And thus, we must...

5997
03:19:18,100 --> 03:19:20,020
Why am I punished for...

5998
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:20,840
For...

5999
03:19:20,840 --> 03:19:21,860
For yapping, huh?

6000
03:19:22,460 --> 03:19:24,580
Why am I punished for yapping?

6001
03:19:24,820 --> 03:19:25,520
That'll be $50.

6002
03:19:26,240 --> 03:19:26,640
Close.

6003
03:19:28,340 --> 03:19:29,840
Close, unfortunately.

6004
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:32,340
But yeah.

6005
03:19:33,060 --> 03:19:33,480
So...

6006
03:19:33,480 --> 03:19:35,760
Then I can just schedule my next appointment.

6007
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:37,100
And then I get the tube.

6008
03:19:37,580 --> 03:19:38,760
And if they have...

6009
03:19:38,760 --> 03:19:40,400
If they take pictures and show me...

6010
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:41,340
Which they should take pictures.

6011
03:19:41,440 --> 03:19:41,940
But if they...

6012
03:19:41,940 --> 03:19:44,380
If they give them to me, I will show you guys.

6013
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:45,980
Um...

6014
03:19:45,980 --> 03:19:46,900
I'll say...

6015
03:19:46,900 --> 03:19:48,060
Here's your warning.

6016
03:19:48,520 --> 03:19:48,680
Here's your warning.

6017
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:49,420
Three, two, one.

6018
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:50,720
Minto's throw!

6019
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:51,880
Blah!

6020
03:19:51,960 --> 03:19:52,360
Blah!

6021
03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:52,600
Blah!

6022
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:52,800
Blah!

6023
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:53,040
Blah!

6024
03:19:53,340 --> 03:19:53,440
Blah!

6025
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:53,740
Blah!

6026
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:54,640
Blah!

6027
03:19:56,060 --> 03:19:56,920
For free?

6028
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:58,740
Yeah, for free.

6029
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:00,680
Hopefully it doesn't look so bad.

6030
03:20:00,860 --> 03:20:01,800
What if it's like...

6031
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:03,580
Covered in nodules.

6032
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:04,860
And they're like...

6033
03:20:04,860 --> 03:20:05,640
They're like, yeah.

6034
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:06,600
It looks bad.

6035
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:07,720
And then I'm like...

6036
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:09,140
Okay, I'm gonna show my chat now.

6037
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:18,060
Because I've healed up pretty well, I feel...

6038
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:19,600
I don't think it will...

6039
03:20:21,720 --> 03:20:22,240
Like...

6040
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:24,240
Be so bad that I need surgery.

6041
03:20:24,240 --> 03:20:26,620
But I think the extra month off...

6042
03:20:26,620 --> 03:20:28,680
Or less streams will be good.

6043
03:20:29,360 --> 03:20:30,840
And then hopefully...

6044
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:32,800
If they give me some medicine or something...

6045
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:33,960
That would be good too.

6046
03:20:34,540 --> 03:20:35,520
I hope.

6047
03:20:37,020 --> 03:20:38,500
Think of the content.

6048
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:40,820
No vocal cord parasite.

6049
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:43,640
Your throat will be beautiful?

6050
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:45,620
You think so?

6051
03:20:48,640 --> 03:20:49,900
Flutter my eyelashes.

6052
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:51,520
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.

6053
03:20:52,480 --> 03:20:54,240
What if there's a baby in there?

6054
03:20:54,640 --> 03:20:56,640
I hope it gives me a middle finger.

6055
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,820
It's just like, yeah, I've been...

6056
03:21:00,820 --> 03:21:03,040
Bing-bonging on your vocal cords.

6057
03:21:04,640 --> 03:21:05,700
Suck it, loser.

6058
03:21:07,180 --> 03:21:08,160
Remember me though?

6059
03:21:08,380 --> 03:21:09,680
Tough times never last.

6060
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,540
Only tough people last.

6061
03:21:16,220 --> 03:21:18,440
We need a vocal cord live stream.

6062
03:21:20,460 --> 03:21:22,780
That goes a little outside my comfort zone.

6063
03:21:25,140 --> 03:21:27,040
Yeah, this was such a fun collab.

6064
03:21:27,200 --> 03:21:29,320
I hope you guys enjoyed watching...

6065
03:21:29,320 --> 03:21:30,600
Us be silly, silly.

6066
03:21:34,360 --> 03:21:34,920
And...

6067
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:36,580
I'm gonna finish my dinner now.

6068
03:21:37,100 --> 03:21:38,080
My sandwich.

6069
03:21:39,320 --> 03:21:40,460
It was so fun!

6070
03:21:40,900 --> 03:21:41,680
I'm so glad that...

6071
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:44,800
Actually, this is my first time collabing in-game with Doobie.

6072
03:21:45,480 --> 03:21:46,040
So...

6073
03:21:46,040 --> 03:21:47,400
Really happy that I could...

6074
03:21:47,400 --> 03:21:49,220
Finally, actually collab with her.

6075
03:21:50,040 --> 03:21:50,600
And...

6076
03:21:50,600 --> 03:21:52,920
Of course, I'm always...

6077
03:21:52,920 --> 03:21:55,440
Happy to collab with Nimmi.

6078
03:21:55,440 --> 03:21:56,300
And...

6079
03:21:56,300 --> 03:21:57,420
Doki behaved today.

6080
03:21:57,940 --> 03:21:58,680
So...

6081
03:22:04,820 --> 03:22:06,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6082
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:06,820
Okay.

6083
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:07,720
I head out.

6084
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:08,600
And...

6085
03:22:08,600 --> 03:22:09,660
I will see you guys...

6086
03:22:09,660 --> 03:22:10,960
When I see you next...

6087
03:22:12,680 --> 03:22:13,700
You mean Freddy?

6088
03:22:14,580 --> 03:22:15,220
Freddy?

6089
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:17,060
Freddy!

6090
03:22:19,560 --> 03:22:20,320
Freddy!

6091
03:22:20,320 --> 03:22:20,460
I'm ready!

6092
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:24,280
Otsumita!

6093
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Thank you, everybody!

6094
03:22:26,680 --> 03:22:28,500
I didn't even welcome you guys in.

6095
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:29,840
I'm so sorry to the maid cafe.

6096
03:22:30,220 --> 03:22:31,580
Well, I will say...

6097
03:22:33,920 --> 03:22:35,320
And I will say...

6098
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:36,380
Kittu rashai!

6099
03:22:37,220 --> 03:22:37,680
Ojo-sama!

6100
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:39,300
Ojo-sama!

6101
03:22:39,300 --> 03:22:39,400
Ojo-sama!

6102
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:40,160
Wait, did I say...

6103
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:40,860
Ojo-sama before?

6104
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:41,560
Ojo-sama!

6105
03:22:45,830 --> 03:22:46,350
And...

6106
03:22:46,350 --> 03:22:46,670
Goodnight.

6107
03:22:47,750 --> 03:22:48,270
Otsumita!

6108
03:22:48,690 --> 03:22:49,290
Bye-bye!

6109
03:22:49,510 --> 03:22:50,110
Thanks for watching.

6110
03:22:50,230 --> 03:22:51,070
Thanks for hanging out.

6111
03:22:51,450 --> 03:22:51,990
Bye-bye!

6112
03:22:52,130 --> 03:22:52,370
Bye-bye!

6113
03:23:02,930 --> 03:23:04,270
The mic is hard!
