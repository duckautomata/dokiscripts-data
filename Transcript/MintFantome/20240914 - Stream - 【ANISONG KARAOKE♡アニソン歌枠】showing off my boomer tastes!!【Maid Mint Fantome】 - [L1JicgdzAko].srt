1
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,300
Can you guys hear... the... the audio?

2
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,420
Can you guys hear it?

3
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,330
I can sometimes you can hear it.

4
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,830
Sometimes you cannot hear it.

5
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
Now you can hear the audio.

6
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,700
The gavel you got is cool?

7
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,480
I know!

8
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,460
I know!

9
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,160
I know!

10
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,660
I know!

11
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,440
I know!

12
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,820
I know!

13
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,720
Oido!

14
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,660
Oido in the court!

15
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't want to hit it too hard.

16
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,020
I don't want to ruin it or have a break from my strength.

17
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,950
Oido!

18
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,410
Oido!

19
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,910
Oido!

20
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,610
Yeah, this is when you guys are being bad.

21
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,690
The bonk is gonna be real.

22
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,190
Stop being bad!

23
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,950
Sounds like there's nothing in your brain.

24
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,210
Your head is hollow.

25
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,490
Smells like wood.

26
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,730
The gavel does not smell like wood.

27
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,250
The base though, smells like wood.

28
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,790
Yummy.

29
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,870
Sniffer, sniffer.

30
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,590
Anyway.

31
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,010
Anyway, I put it on the ground.

32
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,910
I...

33
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,430
am singing!

34
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,590
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,650
Oh boy, I hope she plays Hot To Go.

36
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,950
Ashes, this is Minto's dream.

37
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,710
H-O-T-T-O...

38
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,350
You can take me hot to go.

39
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,590
Except, not today.

40
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,950
There's no...

41
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,990
Probably no English.

42
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,210
If it's English, it's gotta be anime English.

43
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,230
Five months, baby.

44
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,770
Yeah!

45
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,090
Oh my gosh.

46
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:18,910
I hope my...

47
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,630
Earlier I was on Matara's stream and she was like, Wow girl, you sound raspy.

48
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,930
And I was like...

49
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,830
She was like, probably from like, all the recording.

50
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,970
We talked for like, literally like, six or seven hours yesterday.

51
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,150
She was probably from like, all the talking and all the recording.

52
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,670
And I was like, I sure hope I'm not raspy.

53
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,650
I have a karaoke tonight.

54
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,630
So, if I'm raspy, if my voice is bad, I'm so sorry.

55
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,050
Mr. Mel-chan, thank you for the 5k of debt.

56
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

57
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,210
Five months!

58
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,310
Otake time.

59
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,910
Sometimes otake, sometimes whatever.

60
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,430
I don't know.

61
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,470
Actually, I have no list at all.

62
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,390
I was just gonna go into here.

63
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,750
I didn't mean to click that.

64
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,070
Yeah, um...

65
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,030
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

66
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,510
What are these, though?

67
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,110
Sabikara?

68
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,330
Is that like, only singing the chorus?

69
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,110
That's kind of awesome.

70
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,790
That's kind of for me.

71
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,510
I feel like...

72
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,590
I never really do, like, themed karaoke.

73
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,410
Like, you know, this one's an Annie song, obviously.

74
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,150
But...

75
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,610
Um...

76
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,130
Because I always realize how much I don't remember of a song.

77
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:44,450
You know?

78
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,510
Or like, I only have listened to the...

79
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,010
Like, either I only listen to it at Annie Karaoke, or...

80
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,190
Or I only listen to it when it's playing in the show.

81
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,670
So I only know the TV size.

82
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,730
And then I'm like, oh, shoot, I don't know the whole song.

83
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,110
You know?

84
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,910
What is under Sabikara, though?

85
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,410
I wonder if it's a bunch of songs that people are...

86
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,450
Oh.

87
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,610
Peace sign?

88
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,470
That's peace sign, right?

89
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,890
This is, um...

90
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,250
Oh, gosh.

91
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,030
I can't...

92
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,570
That's the Honeyworks idol group, isn't it?

93
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,610
That's the one?

94
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,450
Yeah, I know it.

95
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,130
I know it!

96
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,970
Oh, Aquarian!

97
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,510
See that?

98
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,770
But I know that whole song.

99
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,910
I want to try and sing songs that I don't always sing.

100
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,710
But also...

101
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,650
It's hard.

102
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,550
Remembering so many songs, you know?

103
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,090
It's hard remembering so many songs.

104
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,870
Hanabi.

105
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,530
Fireworks songs.

106
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,130
Natsu Fest.

107
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,830
Summer songs.

108
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,090
Natsu Utau summer songs.

109
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,710
Game songs.

110
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,910
And then...

111
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,770
Wedding songs!

112
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,720
What's under game songs?

113
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:25,890
Oh.

114
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,310
I was like, I wish they would say what game they're from.

115
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,230
It literally has it on the far right.

116
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,870
I was like, this is probably...

117
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,650
Project...

118
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,930
Project Sekai.

119
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,690
What's it called?

120
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,350
What is it in...

121
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,030
What is it in...

122
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,310
What is the English...

123
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,430
Project Sekai...

124
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,370
What's it called in English?

125
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,670
Colorful Stains!

126
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,750
Do you happen to know memory of my first love?

127
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,330
Memory of my first love?

128
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,790
I don't think so.

129
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,390
Who's it by?

130
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:01,950
No.

131
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,490
Not Project Diva.

132
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,490
Project Sekai.

133
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,350
Project Sekai.

134
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,650
Because they can't say Sekai Project.

135
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,190
And they can't call the game.

136
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,130
It's Project Sekai, but they can't call it that.

137
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,850
Because there's a company called Sekai Project that...

138
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,090
It's too close to the name.

139
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,670
Hello, I'm Sekai.

140
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,150
What's your name?

141
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,990
Oh my gosh!

142
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,690
Uma Pyoie!

143
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,110
Kingdom Hearts!

144
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,030
Oh my gosh.

145
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,950
Kingdom Hearts song.

146
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,150
But we're not singing...

147
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,830
We're not singing...

148
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,070
You know...

149
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,050
Game song.

150
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,910
We're singing any song.

151
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,490
After three years, I finally have a stable income again.

152
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,030
So I'm changing back from chronic lurker to semi-frequent super chatter.

153
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,410
Oh my gosh.

154
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,850
Father!

155
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,130
Congratulations!

156
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,830
But you can still chat!

157
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,330
You don't have to be a lurker!

158
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,410
You don't have to...

159
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,430
You don't have to dono!

160
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,270
It's okay!

161
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,950
Thank you though!

162
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,710
Congrats!

163
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,150
Madoka OP.

164
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,510
Uh...

165
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,490
The Claris one?

166
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,210
Babycorn thinks in the power of Chiropter!

167
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,230
Do I get Indian or Ramen tonight?

168
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,890
Indian!

169
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,150
Butter Chicken Curry.

170
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,050
Yum, yum.

171
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,970
What's under...

172
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,450
Wa, wa, wa...

173
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,430
Wedding songs.

174
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,190
Oh my gosh, you guys.

175
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,910
Amai...

176
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,210
Oh my...

177
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,570
Oh no!

178
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:25,690
No!

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,330
Not Sangatsu Kokona Kanna!

180
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,050
Serval!

181
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,110
Thanks to the vibe gifted.

182
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,250
Really thanks to the vibe gifted!

183
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,950
I do sound a little raspy.

184
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,290
Oh no... I'm okay.

185
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,050
Wait, isn't that the song from...

186
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,590
No game, no life.

187
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,190
What the...

188
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,610
Konomi no one?

189
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,330
I'll be honest.

190
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,810
I don't know No Game No Life very much.

191
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,230
Very thanks to the vibe gifted!

192
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,910
It's been five months.

193
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,670
Chill birthday.

194
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,170
Lil happy birthday!

195
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,370
But...

196
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,990
Hold on.

197
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,150
Let me sing happy birthday and then I'll explain what I want to do.

198
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,630
Happy birthday to you.

199
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,170
Happy birthday.

200
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,390
To you.

201
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,930
Happy birthday dear Lu.

202
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,130
Happy birthday to you.

203
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,910
Happy birthday!

204
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,810
So, because I'm just like...

205
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,590
I...

206
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,290
There's so many songs we can sing.

207
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,230
Basically, what I want to do is go to genre.

208
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,290
Hermocrates!

209
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,590
Thanks to the vibe gifted!

210
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,970
And under joy sound...

211
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,370
I'm using the joy sound switch app, in case you're wondering.

212
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,530
They have...

213
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,430
And this is basically...

214
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,410
If you go to anime...

215
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,550
Or...

216
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,090
Anime...

217
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,470
Sorry, I was reading it.

218
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,930
If you go to karaoke in Japan, you can go to genre and there's always an anime genre.

219
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,450
So, you can go to anime.

220
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,630
For real!

221
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,950
And look at this!

222
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,070
Look, they have some that are separated by year.

223
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,630
And then it always starts...

224
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,130
Every time!

225
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,130
It always starts with Ame-gami-sama.

226
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,230
But you know what?

227
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,510
I know...

228
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,190
Ish.

229
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,070
One song.

230
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,850
Ame-gami-sama.

231
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:23,870
So it's really a song...

232
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,730
From Ame-gami-sama.

233
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,430
It's Ishida Yoko, but it's not...

234
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,350
That one.

235
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,930
Not...

236
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,550
Wait, is this one?!

237
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,150
It's from like...

238
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,110
Not the original, Ame-gohdes?

239
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,050
It's like...

240
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,110
The remake of Ame-gohdes?

241
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,190
Eternal Snow or anything from Full Moon...

242
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,750
I can do!

243
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,250
I can do!

244
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:45,650
I can do!

245
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,170
Oh my gosh.

246
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,390
I've never sung this song before.

247
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,490
Open your mind.

248
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,330
Open your mind.

249
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,050
Open your mind.

250
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,270
I don't know if I know it though.

251
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,170
Okay, but yeah, so I want to do... what I want to do... wait, did I say that right?

252
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:15,310
What I want to do is if I can get inspiration in this list, we can just go through it.

253
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,350
There's only 8,653 titles.

254
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,330
So I don't think it'll take too long, you know?

255
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,530
It's no big deal.

256
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,510
It's like so easy, you know?

257
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,950
We can start with the icots.

258
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
What do I want to sing though?

259
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,220
I don't know.

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,080
Only.

261
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
What do you mean only?

262
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,000
Krish, thanks for the five-gifter!

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,880
Fifteen years in Steins Gate?

264
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,690
Fif... Fifteen?

265
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,030
Fifteen years...

266
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,490
Should we sing... Should we start with Steins Gate?

267
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,730
Wait, I would have to search it.

268
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,230
I want to go through the list though.

269
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,130
Oh my gosh, it all starts... it's all like...

270
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,430
There's so many things that start with like... so many idol anime.

271
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:48,230
So it's all just idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol, idol...

272
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,430
Idol, idol, idol...

273
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,590
Stay good!

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,270
Thanks for 5 months!

275
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,410
Stein's cape was 2011.

276
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,430
Butterfly!

277
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,470
You know what?

278
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,140
That's a great...

279
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:05,930
Oh, wait.

280
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,090
I just accidentally pressed...

281
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,830
You know what?

282
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,070
Butterfly is a great one to start with.

283
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,650
I love Butterfly.

284
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,110
You know what?

285
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,570
That's such a good Annie song to start with, right?

286
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,010
That's just like... good... everybody knows Butterfly.

287
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,790
Everybody knows Butterfly!

288
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,090
Sorry.

289
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,150
I'm gonna be a little all over the place today because I...

290
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,570
Oh my gosh, you could just do the Sabikara.

291
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,510
No, we wanna sing... I think I know it well enough to sing the whole one.

292
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,310
Maybe.

293
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,260
I have the

294
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,940
karaoke background!

295
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
So it's like really a karaoke!

296
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,820
It's like, not just the visuals, it's so funny!

297
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,040
It's so low!

298
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh my gosh, it's a little off.

299
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,100
I just wanna have a break, shall we?

300
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,020
Yeah.

301
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,520
No, I can't.

302
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,740
His voice is allワ 아니라

303
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,340
Wow.

304
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,400
Even with unreliable wings, I'm sure I'll be able to fly.

305
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,600
Oh, my love.

306
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,280
How's the audio?

307
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,720
The chorus sounded so good!

308
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll become a floating butterfly and ride on the gentle wind.

309
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,660
I'll go to see you wherever I go.

310
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,800
Even if I say vague things, they're surprisingly useful.

311
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,860
I'm screaming.

312
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,090
I wonder what's going to happen in this city.

313
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,270
But I don't know.

314
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,730
In this world that can't be allowed after an infinite dream,

315
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,950
I'll be the most common sense.

316
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,290
Oh, my love.

317
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,450
I'll go to see you wherever I go.

318
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,950
Even with unreliable wings, I'm sure I'll be able to fly.

319
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,090
Oh, my love.

320
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,090
The karaoke is so funny, isn't it?

321
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,450
The guy is so emo!

322
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,220
It kinda looks like Korsuke.

323
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,420
Oh, my love.

324
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,260
In this world that can't be allowed after an infinite dream,

325
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,040
I'll be the most common sense.

326
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, my love.

327
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,100
Even if I say vague things, they're surprisingly useful.

328
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,300
I'll go to see you wherever I go.

329
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,440
Even if I say vague things, they're surprisingly useful.

330
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,540
I'll be the most common sense.

331
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,340
Oh, my love.

332
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,860
In this world that can't be allowed after an infinite dream, I'll be the most common sense.

333
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,400
Even if I say vague things, they're surprisingly useful.

334
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,380
I'll be the most common sense.

335
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,820
Isn't the纯 to lose a ride bad enough?

336
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,300
the纯 to lose a ride bad enough?

337
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,360
in this정 I'll fly for sure.

338
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,540
Oh, my love.

339
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,220
That was

340
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,860
such a good one to start with!

341
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Are you singing through OBS?

342
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,520
Yes, actually.

343
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,900
It's a little... I'm trying to follow along, but I'm having to listen more than read.

344
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:43,220
I have to read the lyrics, but I can't follow how it tracks over the words.

345
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,900
So it's a little delayed!

346
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,340
But I can listen!

347
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,780
It's okay!

348
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,000
Wait, do I sound delayed?

349
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
I shouldn't, right?

350
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,900
I shouldn't because the audio is tracking through my interface.

351
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,260
No, it's good?

352
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,680
Okay, good.

353
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,860
This is where I put my device.

354
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,180
Stop.

355
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, Matara.

356
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,900
Oh, Matara.

357
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,200
Oh, Matara!

358
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,920
Right on time?

359
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay, good.

360
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,980
I was gonna say.

361
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,780
Even though I'm through OBS, it should be okay.

362
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,600
It should be okay and... oops, my bad.

363
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,860
And we have the karaoke background!

364
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,780
Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I discovered that earlier.

365
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,480
I was just like, this is so funny.

366
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,620
This is so funny.

367
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,520
Let's see.

368
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,860
What's like a 2019 song?

369
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Something... kind of a little bit nostalgic.

370
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Oh, Pretender!

371
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,340
Wait, this is Annie's song?

372
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,380
Confidence Man?

373
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,180
What the hell is this?

374
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,920
This is the one that Kiwawa sung.

375
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,640
I really like this one.

376
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,420
I don't know if I remember it so much though.

377
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,380
What app is this?

378
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,200
It's called JoySound.

379
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,080
It's on the Switch.

380
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,400
Zombie Land song.

381
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,100
We'll get there.

382
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,780
Oh my gosh!

383
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,480
Bokken desho!

384
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,660
Okay, Lia.

385
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,200
For you, I'll sing Bokken desho.

386
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,500
I'll sing Suzumiya Haruhi.

387
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,280
Hi, Lia!

388
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,360
Haruhi.

389
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,960
Bokken desho desho.

390
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm literally in love with you.

391
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,280
Stop!

392
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
That's me at you.

393
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,800
Hahaha.

394
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,060
Bokken...

395
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,400
Is that?

396
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,300
Oh, there it is.

397
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,960
Okay.

398
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,700
We'll do maybe a couple Haruhi songs or something.

399
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,900
Okay, hold on.

400
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,200
Let me update.

401
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,740
I'll try and update the... now playing.

402
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,460
Bokken desho.

403
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Desho... desho.

404
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll try to update it.

405
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,860
I didn't put a setlist because...

406
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,940
I already have so much of the screen taken up by the karaoke thing, so...

407
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,420
Sorry.

408
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,890
Should do a little tick tick tick.

409
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,730
Right?

410
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,460
Whoa, wait, wait.

411
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,460
The answer is always in my heart.

412
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,840
Where's the Purigara?

413
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,200
Where is the Purigara?

414
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,240
Here we go!

415
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,580
Okay, here we go.

416
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:44,840
Here we go again.

417
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,820
Anato o eranda watashi desu.

418
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,640
Mou tomaranai unmeisama kara kimerane kai kedo.

419
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,380
I believe...

420
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,860
Mane dake ja tsumaranai no.

432

Thank you very much.

433
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,320
But yeah, sorry, my Japanese is subpar.

434
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,160
I like, so I can understand better than I can speak.

435
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:00,540
And, you know, so like when I hang out with like Ayami-sensei and stuff, it's her talking a lot and I'll just be like...

436
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,440
And I'm very bad...

437
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,120
This is why I'll never be like a translator or something because I'm so bad.

438
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,660
I can barely speak and come up with words in English.

439
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,060
So when we went to Disney together, it was me, Matara and Ayami-sensei.

440
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:24,940
And Ayami-sensei would say something and she'd be like, she'd be like, can you please translate it for Matara?

441
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,320
And I'd be sitting there like, how do I translate that word?

442
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,540
I'd be like...

443
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,220
And at one point, she was just like, Ayami-sensei was like, do you know Japanese?

444
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,620
And I was like, no.

445
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,200
I was like, I'm a pretender.

446
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,040
Fake it till you make it, baby.

447
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,220
So, you know.

448
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,480
You know, there's troubles again.

449
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,240
I do not perceive.

450
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,000
I do not perceive.

451
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,020
I do not perceive.

452
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,680
I do not perceive.

453
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,220
I do not perceive.

454
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,500
I want to try Pretender.

455
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:06,960
Is it okay?

456
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,280
I don't remember it so well, I think.

457
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,760
I can stop at mid-song if I'm just like, you know what?

458
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,620
I'll learn this for next karaoke.

459
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,720
I don't remember it.

460
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,140
Sorry.

461
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,080
What else happened?

462
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
Oh my gosh!

463
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,360
Wait, Koi Suit and Fortune Cookie.

464
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,840
This is not any song.

465
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,020
This is not anime.

466
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,300
But it's under 2019, I guess.

467
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,220
Oh my gosh, Dragon Ball Kai.

468
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,160
Wait.

469
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,780
Yes?

470
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,320
I don't know.

471
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,580
Wait.

472
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,720
I don't know.

473
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,040
Wait, why is it like...

474
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
These are not any song.

475
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,840
This is just 2019 songs.

476
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,560
Okay, never mind.

477
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,340
We're not going to use this list.

478
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,020
It's misleading.

479
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,140
It's very misleading.

480
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,000
Any song is kind of misleading.

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,860
It's kind of vague label.

482
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,300
Yeah, okay.

483
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,640
I get what you mean.

484
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,040
Because like in Japan, they'll throw like...

485
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,560
If you go through this list, you'll see...

486
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,900
Like, look!

487
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,880
The Peanuts movie!

488
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,880
I love Snoopy.

489
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,280
Anything that's animation just kind of gets thrown into this, right?

490
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,240
Oh my gosh, the Iris movie.

491
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,220
What's...

492
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,520
I saw this movie.

493
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,860
The Iris movie?

494
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,700
It's very cute.

495
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,360
It's very funny.

496
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,780
It's like...

497
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,580
It's like...

498
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,860
It's like...

499
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,060
It feels like very for kids.

500
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,700
But I don't remember I For You.

501
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,760
What other Iris...

502
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,260
Or...

503
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,400
I know there's probably a ton of Iris in here.

504
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,720
Let's see.

505
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,280
Oh gosh.

506
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,920
I probably should...

507
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,360
Okay, I kind of went through this list a little bit earlier.

508
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,400
I didn't...

509
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,620
I think I barely got through the As though.

510
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,660
Oh my gosh.

511
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,260
Aki-Kan.

512
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,620
Wow.

513
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,980
But that's...

514
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,620
Akiba's Trip.

515
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,480
I don't know any songs from Akiba's Trip though.

516
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,200
What's in here?

517
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,920
What?

518
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,040
Haruna Luna?

519
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,080
This is my favorite anime song.

520
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,960
Lips of an Angel.

521
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,260
With the lips of an angel.

522
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,300
Akiba's Beat.

523
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,260
Claris?

524
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,460
What?

525
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,870
I do not want to remember Aki-Kan existed.

526
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,710
Oh, I forgot.

527
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,950
I forgot AOP did the song for...

528
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,710
Milky Holmes?

529
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,030
And yeah, I remember ear horns.

530
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,190
Milky...

531
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,950
Wait, where is...

532
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,670
When is a Milky Holmes in...

533
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,590
What?

534
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,290
Oh my gosh.

535
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,530
And they have like such random stuff on here too.

536
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,590
Like...

537
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,270
Awkwars...

538
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,210
Awkwars.

539
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,650
Awkwars 6 Live.

540
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,390
Windy Stage.

541
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,190
Hmm...

542
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,770
Aquarium?

543
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,550
There was some stuff in here that I thought was really cool.

544
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:08,910
Hold on.

545
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,850
Like I said, I went through it a little bit earlier.

546
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,850
Oh my gosh!

547
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,330
It's Salt Lily!

548
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,330
I don't know any songs but...

549
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:14,490
Wow!

550
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,810
Oh my gosh.

551
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,670
Any 90s anime.

552
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,250
Yeah!

553
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,410
Usse...

554
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,110
Ussewa.

555
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,910
Oh gosh, I don't know if I can sing that song well though.

556
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,970
Usse...

557
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,650
Usse...

558
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,510
Ussewa.

559
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,130
Konyaba Hurricane.

560
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,130
Oh my gosh!

561
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:33,930
Oh my gosh.

562
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,490
I have not heard that song in so long.

563
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,370
Voitan!

564
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,510
I don't know if I'll be able to sing it though.

565
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,470
Azumanga Daiya!

566
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,750
Wait, what's the difference between...

567
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,970
Wait, is this like the OVA?

568
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,650
Like the really...

569
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,450
I remember watching the...

570
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,950
Like the one that looks so beautiful.

571
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,410
Platinum by Maya Sakamoto.

572
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,630
Yes, I know it!

573
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,350
I can sing it later.

574
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,990
I want to do some card capture stuff.

575
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,370
So, that means...

576
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,030
Wait, what's the difference between the animation and this one?

577
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,790
Oh, it's the same.

578
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:18,710
But you guys remember how like there was like that initial like Azumanga Daiya anime that was like so beautifully animated.

579
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,470
It was so...

580
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,110
So...

581
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,930
It was so good.

582
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,390
And then they came out with the full series.

583
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,590
Yeah, the web anime!

584
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,810
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

585
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,010
The 5-minute short.

586
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,850
Yes, yes, yes!

587
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,350
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

588
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,950
I used to watch it over and over and over again.

589
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,650
It was so good.

590
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,330
Satan Dagi!

591
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,370
I'm gonna try...

592
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,330
Wait, Raspberry Heaven.

593
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,830
Raspberry Heaven!

594
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,210
Oh my gosh, it's...

595
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,050
It's been so long since I've sang this.

596
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,330
Or listened to this song even.

597
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,950
Let's try Soramimi Cake.

598
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,550
Akiba's Trip ED has had different Akiba artists.

599
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,110
Like the...

600
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,830
Like illustrations.

601
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,430
I have watched a little bit of Akiba's...

602
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,750
Akiba's Trip, the anime.

603
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,350
But I never finished it.

604
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,970
Oh my gosh, so cute!

605
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:16,950
Ru,

606
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,880
Ra, Ru, piano no asakai no yume.

607
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,520
Sakku no hara ni melody.

608
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,700
Kowareta tokei wo shinjite.

609
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,660
Jikan wa dare no mikari.

610
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,000
Tata.

611
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,340
Doushite konna no watashi no mune.

612
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,220
Yasashii dareka no mattteru no.

613
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,840
Oshiete suteki na mirai.

614
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,260
Moonlight.

615
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,560
Moonlight.

616
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,020
Sleeping.

617
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,000
Ru, Ra, Ru, omoiden.

618
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Ringo ni mezame no shoujo ga.

619
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,680
Kisu shite.

620
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,380
Zetsuna ku hirogeta hon ni wa futari.

621
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,400
No bell ga naru yo.

622
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,640
Dagi, I feel like I can fly.

623
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,440
I feel like I'm in the wrong key.

624
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,100
Oh gosh.

625
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,310
Why are we in space now?

626
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,620
Obvious Quinn strikes again?

627
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

628
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,930
I don't know this song at all.

629
00:39:50,670 --> 00:40:18,690
I don't know this song at all.

630
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:49,030
I don't know this song at all.

631
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,310
I heard that voice.

632
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,810
Obvious moment.

633
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,530
I'm so sorry.

634
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,190
I don't remember much Interstellar Space Travel and Azumaga now.

635
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,510
This music video, it started with the rabbits and stuff.

636
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,170
What happened?

637
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,150
What happened?

638
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,210
That was so bizarre.

639
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,670
Cool.

640
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,170
I'm happy that I'm able to sing some songs I don't usually sing.

641
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,170
Oh no, we have to go.

642
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:20,790
Wait.

643
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,190
Oh no.

644
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,350
Okay, let's just go back to Azumaga Dayo.

645
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,370
Azumaga Dayo, Azumaga Dayo.

646
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,170
Chiyo's dad probably travels through space.

647
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,270
I wish I were a bird.

648
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,330
Azumaga Dayo.

649
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,690
I remember really liking Raspberry Heaven though.

650
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,370
Raspberry Heaven.

651
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,290
Chance we get Kotoko Shooting Star?

652
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:47,790
Yes.

653
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,750
Wait, hold on.

654
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,490
Let me make a list.

655
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,350
Cardcaptors?

656
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:51,990
Cardcaptor Sakura.

657
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,250
Shooting Star.

658
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,950
Azumadin?

659
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:58,610
Madden?

660
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,510
Azumadin.

661
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,470
Azumaga Dayo makes my sides hurt.

662
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,930
Such a good show.

663
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,230
Such a good... wait, did I pass it?

664
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,710
Oh no, no, no.

665
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,210
There we go.

666
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,430
Okay.

667
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,910
Let's see.

668
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,630
Oh my gosh, Azure Lane.

669
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,890
Asobi Asobase.

670
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,530
I don't know anything from it though.

671
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,650
There's so many anime that I'll be like, Oh, it's this anime.

672
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,990
I don't know anything from it.

673
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,770
Oh, it's this anime.

674
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,890
I don't remember the song.

675
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,790
Oh, it's this anime.

676
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,910
I only know the chorus.

677
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,470
Apple TV.

678
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,430
Oh, Dreams.

679
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,690
What about the iPad one?

680
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,270
iPod.

681
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,430
Oh my gosh.

682
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,010
Daft Punk, my favorite anime song.

683
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,690
Hey Mama.

684
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,090
What is this?

685
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,310
Wow.

686
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:50,930
Appleseed.

687
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,610
Oh, sorry, there's an iPad Nano too.

688
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,350
First.

689
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,740
Another.

690
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,960
Why are the songs in another?

691
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,520
Ally Project.

692
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,060
Okay, does the song start like with...

693
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,240
I like when she sings the songs.

694
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,700
They make me happy when I hear what she makes you go.

695
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,900
Oh, see here, we have Frozen.

696
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:27,380
Thank you.

697
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,480
Thank you.

698
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,480
Thank you.

699
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,540
Can I sing Frozen?

700
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,820
It's technically Annie's song.

701
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,740
Fairlyn, thanks.

702
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,340
Welcome to Japari Park.

703
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,360
Oh my gosh.

704
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,020
I sang that.

705
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,060
Japari Park.

706
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
I sang that actually recently at karaoke.

707
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,860
I can sing it.

708
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah.

709
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,520
Both.

710
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,520
Sugoi and Tanoshii.

711
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,600
I'll sing it in Japanese.

712
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:51,800
Okay.

713
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,100
Please find a song to keep with the theme.

714
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,780
Okay, guys?

715
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,700
I don't know if I've ever sang it.

716
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,560
Let it go.

717
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,100
She's so emo.

718
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,200
Is she crying?

719
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,280
No, don't cry.

720
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,640
Oh my God.

721
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:47,940
降り始めた雪は足跡を消して 真白な世界に一人の私 風が心に囁くの このままじゃダメなんだと

722
00:44:51,680 --> 00:45:06,140
戸惑い 傷つき 誰にも打ちかけずに 悩んでた それも やめよう

723
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,920
ありのままの姿見せるのよ ありのままの姿見せるのよ

724
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:47,900
A little pause... and we are back.

725
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:17,900
A little pause...

726
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:17,900
and we are back.

727
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,900
A little pause...

728
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:47,900
and we are back.

729
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,580
Oh my gosh!

730
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,320
Is this a love song?

731
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,360
Why is she breaking up with him?

732
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,220
What's going on?

733
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,500
She's letting it go.

734
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,700
You guys.

735
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,580
She let it go.

736
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,180
So dramatic.

737
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,020
Oh my gosh.

738
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,040
What anime was that from?

739
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,640
That was from Fudozen.

740
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,780
Let it ghost?

741
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,540
Let it ghost.

742
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,180
Let it ghost.

743
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,580
Oh no.

744
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,040
We're going to have to go through the whole list again.

745
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,160
This is kind of...

746
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,260
I have some songs.

747
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,560
Actually, I have some songs I want to sing.

748
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,280
So we'll go back through the list in a bit.

749
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,360
For now, let's go do some of the songs that...

750
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,220
Like, let's see.

751
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,820
Is it like...

752
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,080
Wait, am I stupid?

753
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,420
I think I'm dumb.

754
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:43,820
Hold on.

755
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,740
Wait, what am I thinking of?

756
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,120
Ka...

757
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:47,960
Ka...

758
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:48,840
Ka...

759
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,200
It's Kado.

760
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,560
Yeah.

761
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,660
What am I thinking of?

762
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,860
Sometimes they like stylize things, you know?

763
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,920
Kado Kaptur.

764
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,480
Kaptur.

765
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,580
K-K-K-K-Kaptur.

766
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,720
Kado Kaptur.

767
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,360
I don't know.

768
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,700
I need to...

769
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,940
Nanai no Biori.

770
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,760
No, no.

771
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,660
Oh, I don't know.

772
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,380
No, no.

773
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,540
Biori OP.

774
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,140
I'm sorry.

775
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm so sorry.

776
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,080
What?

777
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:20,520
Joy!

778
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,900
Looking for the Hawkeye Super!

779
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,400
Oh, oh, wait.

780
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:24,920
I need a...

781
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,640
I need a small.

782
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,640
How do I make it small?

783
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,720
Oh, no, no, no.

784
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,180
Oh, whoops.

785
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,060
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

786
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:32,920
Wait, hold...

787
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,600
No, no, no!

788
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,880
I messed up.

789
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,420
My bad.

790
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:35,720
Hold on.

791
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,040
Wait.

792
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,240
Oh, X.

793
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:37,980
X.

794
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,820
How do I make it small?

795
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,340
Wait.

796
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,120
Oh, I see...

797
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,300
If I do this...

798
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,860
Oh, there it is.

799
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,160
There it is.

800
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,480
There it is.

801
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:48,700
Okay.

802
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,020
It's been a while since I've used this.

803
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,220
Sorry.

804
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,560
There we go.

805
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:51,880
Okay.

806
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,460
Kaido Kyapta.

807
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,080
Okay.

808
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:57,740
Okay.

809
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,880
There's so many I want to do here.

810
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,080
I'll start with this one.

811
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,710
This one's so nostalgic for me.

812
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,380
Fukushiki no Karte?

813
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,500
I would, but I think my stream will get taken down.

814
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,600
It's good for our vest, but still...

815
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
Yeah.

816
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,780
It's getting me excited!

817
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,860
Oh, this girl likes to dream.

818
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,920
How do I get anything done right?

819
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,320
You're really good at favouritism.

820
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,020
I have an idea, but I feel that Mar Master bleed...

821
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,800
Wow!

822
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,620
California, maybe!

What?

842
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,830
What are you... What?

843
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,850
What are you talking about?

844
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,530
What if for the next karaoke stream you gave members the code to add songs to your playlist?

845
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,310
How do I do that?

846
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,010
You can do that?

847
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,170
With Joysop?

848
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,610
Why is the Carpenters in the top ranking?

849
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:00,950
Interesting.

850
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,010
Oemo did it before?

851
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:03,890
Really?

852
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,300
Hi Minto, do you know any songs by Hokutsuwa?

853
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,080
What's that?

854
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,220
Sakura Kiss from Oran!

855
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,720
Wait, hold on.

856
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,540
What do you mean, Godder?

857
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,140
What does that mean?

858
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,980
Let me karaoke pause.

859
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,340
Thanks!

860
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,020
What is that?

861
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,300
Wait, what is it?

862
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,280
What is it?

863
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,560
What is it?

864
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,220
What did I say?

865
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,640
What did I just... what?

866
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,010
Hokutsuwa girl?

867
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,640
Hokutsuwa girl?

868
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,400
Wait, I probably shouldn't say it.

869
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,380
It's a TikTok thing.

870
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,100
What?

871
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,920
Oh wait, I think I know.

872
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,500
I think I know what you're talking about.

873
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,960
The girl that was just like... did that interview, right?

874
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,320
The street interview thing?

875
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,210
I just sang Wholesome Cardcaptor Sakura.

876
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:32,990
And you're gonna come in here... wait... and you're gonna... you're gonna... you're gonna ruin the vibe.

877
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,090
Bad chat.

878
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:55,610
I'm vibing.

879
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
This is the last Sakura song I'll do.

880
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,640
There is one Tsubasa song I want to see if they have.

881
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh yeah!

882
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,280
Look at this guy!

883
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,280
Holy reverb scares me.

884
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:27,560
He is a dreamer Hisomu power

885
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:45,440
Watashi no sekai Yume to koi to fuan de dekiteru

886
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,780
It's so romantic!

887
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:46,240
Like how someone said cringe music video that's just that's just karaoke music videos That's why they're the first.

888
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,540
What is he doing?

889
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,480
He is a dream.

890
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,680
I didn't expect the cut.

891
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,460
He's so blue power.

892
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,720
I'm sorry!

893
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,040
Oh my god, this is so good.

894
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,920
Stop, I'm reading chat.

895
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,480
Stop saying staring contest.

896
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,060
They're not even getting wet.

897
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,510
I'm so sorry that I could not I could not stop the music video.

898
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:29,670
I'm so sorry.

899
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,710
I could not stop laughing.

900
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,890
Oh, that was Platinum.

901
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,710
Sorry, I forgot to update the list.

902
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,470
That was Platinum from Cardcaptor Sakura.

903
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,530
Oh, I'm so sorry.

904
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,850
That was so funny though.

905
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,050
That was so funny!

906
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,190
Shiny days.

907
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:48,570
Okay.

908
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,010
I want to try the orange.

909
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,130
There's... wait.

910
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,690
Oh, the Tsubasa.

911
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,710
Let me try Tsubasa real quick.

912
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,670
And then I'll go to ORA in high school, high school.

913
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,650
Trying to sing songs that I don't usually sing, right?

914
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,190
Oh my gosh.

915
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,490
I almost called you the wrong name.

916
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,450
Preparations for throwing off the vibe.

917
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,110
Stop.

918
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,610
Also requesting Hana Yamada opening.

919
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:23,070
Okay.

920
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,090
Hana, thank you for talking so far.

921
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,750

925
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,430
Not... stop.

Tori no uta.

927
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,010
Tori no uta.

928
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,030
I can sing.

929
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:50,930
I can sing.

930
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,330
Do I just put in Kuronikuru?

931
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:02,710
Okay, I'll invest.

932
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,310
I'll invest.

933
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:03,830
I'll invest.

934
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:07,990
Let's see.

935
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,930
There's a lot of the songs I don't remember.

936
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,350
But there... oh, this one.

937
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,090
Oh my gosh.

938
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,230
I really... okay.

939
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,770
This song is sad song.

940
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,430
Okay, guys.

941
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,510
Oh my gosh.

942
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,270
I didn't even press it.

943
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:21,970
It did it for me.

944
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,450
That's crazy.

945
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:24,450
Girls in Pants are... oh my gosh.

946
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,890
Korin, I'm so sorry.

947
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,030
I don't know.

948
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,380
Who you cut this music video for?

949
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:48,820
雨に濡れた頬は

950
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:06,140
涙の匂いがした 優しい眼差しの 旅人

951
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:23,900
静かに響いてる 懐かしい音楽

952
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:58,840
思い出せない記憶 A little pause... and we are back.

953
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:11,460
A little pause... and we are back.

954
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,600
A little pause... and we are back.

955
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:27,800
A little pause...

956
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,180
and we are back.

957
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:24,030
Oh my gosh, I've never sung that song ever, ever, ever, ever, like not even even once in karaoke before.

958
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,510
I can't believe I remember almost the whole thing.

959
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,050
I can't believe it.

960
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:35,730
What's the... what's the Japanese title for Oran hosu...

961
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,420
Oran koko shisei?

962
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,470
Oran koko hosutobu?

963
01:06:58,610 --> 01:06:59,110
Oh, really?

964
01:06:59,230 --> 01:06:59,450
That's it?

965
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,920
I kind of want to sing this real quick, sorry.

966
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,720
Sorry.

967
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,840
Odamajo Carnival.

968
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:44,000
Dokkiri dokkiri don don, fushigi na chikara odorei doshi oda suru.

01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,520
Bikkuri bikkuri bin bin, nannara nara osu dekinai desho.

01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:56,200
Ii yone, kitto mainichi ga michi kiyobi, gakko no naka ni yuuenji.

01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,980
Yaman shukudai wa senbu komi hako ni sutechae.

972
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,860
Fufufufu.

973
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,410
Kyokasou itemo, kaitenai.

974
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:15,720
Kedo koneko nigite mo, soupo muku kedo.

01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,740
Demo ne, moshikashite hontou ni, dekichau kamoshirenai yo.

976

Ookina koe de bebi fiorita ra, hasari de sawa de utaecha e.

977
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:36,400
Papa, mama, sentei, kamegami, ojisan, urusai nante de kazan de kan.

978
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Oh, oh, sorry.

979
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,780
Hibike pikara pikara, tonde hashite mawatcha e.

980
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,380
Testo de santen, egao de monten, doki doki, waku waku na nu-mu-kyuu

981
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,940

982
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,760
Oh my god.

983
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,060
Whoa!

984
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,220
Wow, this is so awesome!

985
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,780
Rin

986
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:21,950

Ii desho, ii yo ne!

989

Iito mainichi ga tanjoubi, haisha-san zutto yasumi.

01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:40,730
Sorry.

992
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:47,010
Sonna murumi sa, kimi wa warau dake.

01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:53,650
Koi ni yuukui ite mo, shippo furu dake.

01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:58,750
Hontou ni dekichau kamoshirenai yo.

996
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:00,970
Tatararattata!

997
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,350
Ookina koe de, pikarapitara.

01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:07,670
Muzakende, sawagite, odoucha e.

999
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,890
Papa mama senzu, kami kami ojisan.

Tentei kameru naruchisai, osora ni.

1001
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,000
Where are we in space?

1002
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,100
It's a little happy fight.

1003
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,500
Mubu kamikite, ore ni, genji mo yu.

1004
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,000
Woi.

1005
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,300
Tara, hasai de sawai.

1006
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,110
Kami kami ojisan, urusai nante ne.

1007
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,030
Kansai mai.

1008
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,030
Kansai komi no.

1009
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,570
I can't even read, it's so fast.

1010
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,270
I better be...

1011
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:47,030
Tara da, tatara la la la la, la la.

1012
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,230
La la la.

1013
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,170
Ten te ga ten wa ran ten.

1014
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:50,830
Tokido.

1015
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,620
I just wanted a song to pick up the mood after the last one.

1016
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:01,840
Yeah!

1017
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:03,840
Ujamajo Carnival!

1018
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,640
That music video was awesome.

1019
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,060
Na na na na na, la la.

1020
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,260
La la na na na, la la.

1021
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,280
Na na na na na, na na.

1022
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,060
Na na na na na, na na.

1023
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:20,820
Cutie honey!

1024
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,090
Do you know Ultra Relax?

1025
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,930
The second opening...

1026
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:33,790
Maybe.

1027
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,350
Oh my gosh.

1028
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,150
Oh my gosh, Chilli X, maybe.

1029
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,230
Hold on, Kodocha.

1030
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:39,270
I'll add it to the list.

1031
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:40,510
Oh my gosh.

1032
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,430
Mariaholic?

1033
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:45,030
Actually, I wanted to sing something from Mariaholic.

1034
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:48,850
Okay, hold on.

1035
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,030
Oran.

1036
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,550
I was gonna do Oran now.

1037
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,010
Wait, no, no, no.

1038
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,370
Oh, I went all the way back.

1039
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:56,470
Wait, no.

1040
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:57,870
No, go back, go back, go back.

1041
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,390
There, there.

1042
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:01,330
Oran.

1043
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1044
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,430
Love Hina.

1045
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:08,210
Oh my gosh.

1046
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:08,910
Yes!

1047
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,230
So...

1048
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:12,410
Takizo, thanks for the thumbnail.

1049
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,510
I love it.

1050
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:16,450
Oh, and let me add Komugi too since it's Komugi style.

1051
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,990
And Popotan.

1052
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:21,150
Serious request.

1053
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,230
Wagamama Mirahar.

1054
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:22,590
Okay.

1055
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:25,170
Wagamama Mirahar.

1056
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:28,910
Okay.

1057
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,870
Okay.

1058
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:43,810
Maybe hold off on some requests because I have a pretty long list.

1059
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:44,650
Okay?

1060
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,210
So I'm gonna catch up to it.

1061
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:46,430
Okay?

1062
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,130
Okay.

1063
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:47,970
Maybe hold off on some requests because I have a pretty long list.

1064
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:48,310
Okay.

1065
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,500
And if you write it now, or say something now, I might forget it later, you know?

1066
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,600
So...

1067
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,540
Sakura Kiss.

1068
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,220
Oh gosh.

1069
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,360
Wait, now I'm thinking of Love Hina.

1070
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,300
Wait...

1071
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,480
Sakura Kiss...

1072
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:06,680
Oh!

1073
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,140
I remember!

1074
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,720
Kiss, Kiss for Love!

1075
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,980
I might not remember the whole thing though.

1076
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,120
I was thinking of the ending though.

1077
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,820
I really loved the Oran High School Host Club ending, you know?

1078
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,690
No, not this one again.

1079
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,830
Oh, wait, wait, I totally missed that word.

1080
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,250
Oh,

1081
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,730
wait, wait, I totally missed that word.

1082
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,820
I don't know the full version of this song at all.

1083
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:50,290
I don't know the full version of this song at all.

1084
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:55,850
Oh, wait, wait, I totally missed that word.

1085
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,790
Oh, wait, wait,

1086
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:12,970
I totally missed that word.

1087
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:16,820
Yeah.

1088
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
That one was tough.

1089
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,420
Not gonna lie, that one was tough.

1090
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,600
That one was kind of tough.

1091
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,760
I tried though.

1092
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,340
I tried, I tried, I tried.

1093
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,660
I tried, I tried, I tried.

1094
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,440
It's time... for...

1095
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,000
go... to...

1096
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,440
go...

1097
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,250
Yay!

1098
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,270
I have some macross I want to do later.

1099
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:04,690
No worries.

1100
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,330
Oh my gosh.

1101
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,250
How does the Excel world opening?

1102
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,070
Is this the opening?

1103
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,010
I can't remember how it goes.

1104
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,370
I don't remember.

1105
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,070
Oh, there's some Miku songs on here.

1106
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,050
I wonder if I should...

1107
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,230
There's one!

1108
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:25,450
There's a Vocaloid song I want to sing.

1109
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,810
Sorry, it's not any song, but you know, kind of.

1110
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,850
Can you sing?

1111
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:32,990
I can't even read that.

1112
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:38,330
I can't even read it.

1113
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,270
I like how it just says, say you, say you, say you.

1114
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:48,130
Excel world.

1115
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,270
When they got twins.

1116
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:52,850
Oh my gosh, they have resublimity!

1117
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,110
I tried singing it before though.

1118
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,190
Someone asked for shooting star.

1119
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,350
Even though I sang it before, I really love this song.

1120
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:04,710
I love it.

1121
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,010
Mahoromatic.

1122
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:14,150
I've only seen the spring special of Mahoromatic.

1123
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:14,770
Not the...

1124
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,950
Not the original.

1125
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,480
The VOD got pulled.

1126
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,680
Okay, let's sing it again.

1127
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:06,970
🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵

1128
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:36,950
A little pause...

1129
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,950
and we are back.

1130
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:55,430
A little

1131
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:01,540
pause...

1132
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,200
and we are back.

1133
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:42,520
A little pause... and we are back.

1134
01:21:51,720 --> 01:22:12,540
A little pause... and we are back.

1135
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,280
She's the last woman on earth.

1136
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,540
Go!

1137
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,580
Na!

1138
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:39,650
Onegai teacher!

1139
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:40,170
Yes!

1140
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,560
This song is perfect.

1141
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,500
Such a good song!

1142
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,020
Sorry if my timing was off on that one.

1143
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,380
It was hard to... with the lag, the OBS lag.

1144
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,340
Ima mo mukashimo Kotoko saikou yo!

1145
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,020
Souda yone!

1146
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,720
Kotoko saikou!

1147
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,680
I love Kotoko.

1148
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,060
Wait, actually, can I go into my history?

1149
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,140
And like, just search her again?

1150
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,360
Maybe I want to do another Kotoko.

1151
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:51,900
Can I...

1152
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,180
Wait, I can put her in my...

1153
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,640
In my artist I like.

1154
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,800
Hi, it's me!

1155
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,840
I meant to sing that one song.

1156
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,620
My cat has been staring at the screen Watching this whole karaoke.

1157
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,480
Safe to say, myth karaoke is cat approved.

1158
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,500
Also, let me get some of those stocks.

1159
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:08,560
Shush!

1160
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,040
Motake sailor fuku!

1161
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,060
It's too fast!

1162
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,340
There is... actually, hold on.

1163
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,520
There is another Suzumiya Haruhi song that I want to do, though.

1164
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,060
I did Boken desho desho earlier.

1165
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,560
But it's another song.

1166
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,260
Oh, it's...

1167
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,120
Shuuu...

1168
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:32,720
Shuu...

1169
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:34,780
Shuzo...

1170
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,180
Shuzumiya...

1171
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:39,420
Shuzo...

1172
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:39,440
Shuzo...

1173
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,160
Shuzo...

1174
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,120
Shuzo...

1175
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:41,920
Shuzo...

1176
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
Shuzo...

1177
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,620
Shuzo...

1178
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,360
Shuzo...

1179
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:58,800
Shuzo...

1180
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:58,880
Shuzo...

1181
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:58,920
Shuzo...

1182
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,060
Shuzo...

1183
01:25:59,060 --> 01:25:59,700
Shuzo...

1184
01:25:59,700 --> 01:25:59,920
Shuzo...

1185
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,360
Shuzo...

1186
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:00,740
Shuzo...

1187
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:00,800
Shuzo...

1188
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,080
Shuzo...

1189
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:01,720
Shuzo...

1190
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,560
Shuzo...

1191
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,360
Shuzo...

1192
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,320
Shuzo...

1193
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,220
You know what?

1194
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,520
Why not do both?

1195
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,380
Oh my gosh, I don't think I've ever sung this song in karaoke before.

1196
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,420
This is from Haruhi Suzumiya.

1197
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,540
No, no, no, is this music video?

1198
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:33,800
Haruhi Suzumiya!

1199
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,080
I will ignore.

1200
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,340
I say,

1201
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,140
I say, my heaven.

1202
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:30,420
Oh my gosh, I can't read.

1203
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,610
I can't

1204
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:15,730
read.

1205
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,630
I can't read.

1206
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:32,130
I can't read.

1207
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:39,150
I don't know.

1208
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:44,590
So much kanji.

1209
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:17,550
I can't even read it.

1210
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:19,870
And then these two bozos in the background.

1211
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:20,850
I can't...

1212
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,110
It's so much kanji.

1213
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,390
I can't even read it.

1214
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:41,990
And then these two bozos in the background.

1215
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,430
I can't...

1216
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:21,070
It's so much kanji.

1217
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:21,350
I can't even read.

1218
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:23,710
And then these two bozos in the background.

1219
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,090
I can't read.

1220
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:28,370
Why was I mad?

1221
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,440
Oh my god.

1222
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:33,700
I still have no idea.

1223
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,060
What's going on?

1224
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:34,640
Oh my gosh.

1225
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:46,730
I don't know.

1226
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:47,450
I can't even read.

1227
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,610
I can't even read.

1228
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,430
Sorry, I'm trying to read today.

1229
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,010
Sorry, but I can't.

1230
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:51,750
Maybe I should like, pull up.

1231
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:52,410
Maybe I shouldn't.

1232
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,670
Okay, I'm going to start pulling up lyrics instead of on the...

1233
01:30:55,190 --> 01:31:00,250
Instead of going through OBS, it's just been leading to my downfall.

1234
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:08,010
Let me go back to Suzumiya Haruhi, because I do want to sing last in my music.

1235
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,490
I do want to sing it!

1236
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:14,310
Groovin' Magic.

1237
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:21,030
I'll think about it, since I did a couple Cardcaptor songs.

1238
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,230
That's the one that's...

1239
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:34,210
That one, right?

1240
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:36,950
Okay.

1241
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:38,850
Okay.

1242
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,510
That's my music!

1243
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:51,320
That one.

1244
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,720
I still, I still, I love you.

1245
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,660
I'm waiting, waiting forever.

1246
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,520
I still, I still, I love you.

1247
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,040
I can't stop.

1248
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:50,390
A little pause... and we are back.

1249
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,270
約束ふわりと暗い夜に消えた

1250
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:26,530
大好きな人よいつもいつまでも探してしまう きっと目が覚めてもまだ幻を感じたいのに I lost, I lost, I lost you.

1251
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,810
You're making, making my music.

1252
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:31,310
I lost, I lost, I lost you.

1253
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:33,090
I can't see you anymore.

1254
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:34,010
No!

1255
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:40,870
For how happy the song is, the lyrics are kind of sad, you know?

1256
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:09,530
The person I love is too far away and I want to cry.

1257
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:18,210
When I wake up tomorrow, you see, hope may be born.

1258
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:20,750
Good night.

1259
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:28,750
The person I love is too far away and I want to cry.

1260
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:36,710
Even if I wake up, I still want to feel the illusion.

1261
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,510
You're making, making my music.

1262
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,290
I still, I still, I love you.

1263
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:45,190
I'm waiting, waiting forever.

1264
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:48,130
I still, I still, I love you.

1265
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:48,630
It won't stop.

1266
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,910
I still, I still, I love you.

1267
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:54,890
I'm waiting, waiting forever.

1268
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,730
I still, I still, I love you.

1269
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,810
We'll meet again, right?

1270
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:01,010
Yeah!

1271
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:06,550
Yeah!

1272
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,300
Oh my gosh.

1273
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,760
Crawling on my little feet, Bakemonogatari ending.

1274
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,880
Didn't you just finish the series?

1275
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,040
It's still...

1276
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,980
It's still summer, technically.

1277
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,520
It's still...

1278
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,920
technically summer.

1279
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,240
Oh my gosh.

1280
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,460
Have you guys ever...

1281
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:03,140
If you fly to Haneda Airport, if you are leaving from Haneda Airport, get there early.

1282
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,340
Right?

1283
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,860
Get there early.

1284
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,380
Because...

1285
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:16,100
At Haneda Airport in Japan, there is a cafe that I've been wanting to go to for so many years.

1286
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,700
And my flight ended up being delayed.

1287
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,000
And it was delayed before I went through security.

1288
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,500
It's before you go through security.

1289
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,060
So you have...

1290
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,940
You can actually just go if you want to.

1291
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,700
But there is a planetarium.

1292
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,700
Oh my gosh.

1293
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,040
There's a planetarium cafe.

1294
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,500
And...

1295
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:35,900
Oh my gosh.

1296
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:36,840
It was so great.

1297
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:47,120
And it really like just brought my summer to an end.

1298
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,180
It was so good.

1299
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,240
It was because they had like...

1300
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,100
They did like different showings.

1301
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,500
You could stay there the whole day if you wanted to.

1302
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,700
They were just like, Here's the schedule of things.

1303
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,680
And I ended it on this...

1304
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:00,200
Oh my gosh.

1305
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,280
On a romantic...

1306
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,000
Oh my gosh.

1307
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,260
On a romantic viewing of the summer sky.

1308
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,220
And it sounded like it was narrated.

1309
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,260
It didn't say the narrator.

1310
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,680
Though it did say the narrator for like another one.

1311
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,440
And it was some dude.

1312
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,820
But it didn't say it for this one.

1313
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,880
But it sounded like...

1314
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,020
Oh my gosh.

1315
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,060
It sounded like Saori Hayami.

1316
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:19,940
And I was just like...

1317
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:21,140
It was so soft.

1318
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,120
And she was so...

1319
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:22,640
I was like...

1320
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,240
I was like...

1321
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:23,680
Oh my gosh.

1322
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:24,960
It was so nice.

1323
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:25,760
And like...

1324
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,600
She was just like...

1325
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,680
There's Deneb.

1326
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:28,600
There's...

1327
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,420
And it was...

1328
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,400
And the whole time I was just thinking of the...

1329
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,960
Summer triangle from this song.

1330
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,300
Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari.

1331
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,020
Prince of Denmark.

1332
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:36,800
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1333
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:38,400
And I was like...

1334
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:38,900
Oh my gosh.

1335
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,440
So...

1336
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:43,580
But...

1337
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:43,860
Okay.

1338
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,620
It was kind of funny.

1339
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,960
Because they advertised it.

1340
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,620
It's a cafe.

1341
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,000
Right?

1342
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:47,640
They're just like...

1343
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,940
Eat while under the stars.

1344
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,520
Have a...

1345
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,100
Have a snack.

1346
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:52,020
Have a meal.

1347
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,340
Under the stars.

1348
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,160
No.

1349
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,380
If you go...

1350
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:56,660
First of all...

1351
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,380
It was like...

1352
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:00,780
It was like a bunch of...

1353
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,860
It was like a bunch of girls.

1354
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:04,860
There was not a single couple in sight.

1355
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:05,580
It was so funny.

1356
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,460
I thought it was going to be full of couples and then me all by myself.

1357
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:09,080
No.

1358
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,320
It was just a bunch of girls.

1359
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:10,840
It was great.

1360
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:14,160
But...

1361
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:16,500
I...

1362
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,320
I would like...

1363
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,280
I got spaghetti.

1364
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,320
And I was eating it.

1365
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:19,660
And I was like...

1366
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,000
Oh my gosh.

1367
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,000
I guess I'll wait for the show to start.

1368
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,040
Because like...

1369
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,620
There was no stars while I was eating.

1370
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,420
You have to...

1371
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,600
You can only go into the...

1372
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,560
To the cafe too.

1373
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,620
Like during the intermissions.

1374
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:29,960
Um...

1375
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,700
And I was like...

1376
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:31,920
Okay.

1377
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:32,420
Well...

1378
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,140
I'll...

1379
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:33,640
I'll like...

1380
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:33,960
You know...

1381
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,820
Have my meal and my drink while the stars are shining.

1382
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,940
And it's like really awesome.

1383
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:38,740
No.

1384
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:39,480
As...

1385
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,700
Everyone was eating and drinking.

1386
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,300
And then as soon as the show started...

1387
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,180
Everybody stopped.

1388
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:44,640
And I was like...

1389
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:44,700
Oh.

1390
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:45,340
Okay.

1391
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,260
I'll also stop.

1392
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,320
And...

1393
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,220
And...

1394
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,280
Um...

1395
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:51,980
Um...

1396
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:52,600
This is...

1397
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:52,740
My...

1398
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:53,520
And then...

1399
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,700
These shows are like 15 minutes long.

1400
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,060
And so...

1401
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,940
By the time it was over...

1402
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,260
My spaghetti was cold.

1403
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:09,410
I actually have a cover of this song.

1404
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,190
Did you guys know that?

1405
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:19,610
Maybe you can see if I've gotten better at singing since I've recorded the song.

1406
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:26,170
You can listen to the cover and then listen to this and maybe see if I've I don't know if I've gotten better or if I've regressed.

1407
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:27,630
Oh wait, hold on.

1408
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,500
Ah, here!

1409
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,360
泣かないで

1410
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:45,580
そう言い聞かせた 泣かないで 泣かないで 強がる私を臆病で 興味がないよなふりをしてた だけど

1411
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,800
胸あさす痛みは増したく 胸あさす痛みは増したく 発想化する

1412
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,460
I can never remember the mix here.

1413
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:51,920
君の隣がいい 真実は残酷だ

1414
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,980
言わなかった 言えなかった

1415
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,820
二度と戻れない あの夏の日

1416
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,800
Thank you for watching this video.

1417
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:21,610
Thank you for watching this video.

1418
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:26,050
Every time I sing that song, Every time I sing that song, I'm like, transported back to my...

1419
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:28,110
To like...

1420
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:32,650
Whenever, you know, when you have like a crush on someone but they don't like you back.

1421
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:33,950
Thank you for singing.

1422
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,070
It's like, oh, you're my life now, Barry!

1423
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:37,750
Shut up.

1424
01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:43,230
It always takes me back to when I had like an unrequited love.

1425
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:44,950
I'm just so sad.

1426
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,430
Thank you!

1427
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:53,210
Thank you!

1428
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:53,570
Thank you, thank you.

1429
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:01,090
So, Violet...

1430
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:04,030
Seriously, I only know one song from Violet Evergarden.

1431
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,510
Definitely improved.

1432
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:08,470
I'll sing it though.

1433
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:10,630
I'll sing the song from...

1434
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,570
Violet Evergarden that I know.

1435
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:17,870
Sorry, it's not this song.

1436
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:19,750
I have so many songs, you guys.

1437
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,150
I'm gonna be here forever.

1438
01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:23,590
Angel Beat, I have it on the list.

1439
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,330
I'm gonna be here forever.

1440
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,460
It's sung by True.

1441
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:40,480
It's probably so many songs though.

1442
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,740
Thank you, thank you.

1443
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:44,460
Chill!

1444
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,380
No, it's True, not Chill.

1445
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:50,740
Going to karaoke later?

1446
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:51,860
Thanks for the cello.

1447
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:54,080
Wait, did I pass it?

1448
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,380
Do they not have it?

1449
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:02,800
Did I pass it?

1450
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:07,840
Sorry, I saw 46.

1451
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:08,600
I was like...

1452
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,660
Well, maybe they don't have it.

1453
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:17,730
The pillows.

1454
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,740
145 bpm catch.

1455
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:40,060
Okay, anyway.

1456
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,080
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

1457
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,440
Let's do Japari Park.

1458
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,180
I had that on the list forever ago.

1459
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:52,660
Wait, is it...

1460
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,720
Is it in Kana?

1461
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:55,640
Ja?

1462
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:56,940
Wait.

1463
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,960
I wanted to do Shinjidai.

1464
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:10,540
Can I?

1465
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:12,620
Okay, I'll do Japari Park after this.

1466
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:14,660
Sorry.

1467
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:26,540
I wanted to try it.

1468
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,700
I don't think I've ever sung this one before.

1469
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,020
Shinjidai is in Boomer?

1470
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:33,540
Shut up!

1471
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:36,520
We're doing a mix!

1472
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:45,570
Little Busters.

1473

What is this music video?!

1486
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,360
Wow!

1487
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:00,060

1488
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,240
This is awesome!

1489
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,860
This is awesome!

1490
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,800
This is awesome!

1491
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:22,940
This is awesome!

1492
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:23,900
Wow!

1493
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,880

1495
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:33,600
I can't believe it!

1496
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:39,130
I did my best.

1497
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:40,750
Wow, this music video is awesome.

1498
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:41,970
Bring back the night!

1499
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:44,990
Let him be part of every music video!

1500
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:48,030
Why didn't they choose this first song about pirates?

1501
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:50,350
Or forever, you know?

1502
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:55,350
That was good.

1503
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:56,130
That was fun.

1504
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,390
That was a good music video.

1505
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:59,230
Yeah, yeah, job.

1506
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:01,210
Job party.

1507
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,420
I die, thank you forever.

1508
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:20,880
Such a good song.

1509
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,300
Wait.

1510
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:26,650
What app is this?

1511
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:27,370
It's called JoySound.

1512
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,290
It's on the Switch.

1513
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:32,090
It's technically free, but you do need a script.

1514
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,290
You have to buy like...

1515
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:35,290
Let's do the Japanese app store.

1516
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:40,660
Yokoso!

1517
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,740
Wait, but it should still show up with Japari.

1518
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:46,800
Maybe they don't have it.

1519
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,800
Yeah, let me try the Yokoso.

1520
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,820
Yokoso, welcome to Japan!

1521
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,420
Japan-e-pack!

1522
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,820
Some wrong notes.

1523
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:01,660
Everybody's a critic.

1524
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,760
Sorry if I don't know a song completely well.

1525
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,700
It's a minto edition, okay?

1526
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:12,520
Yokoo...

1527
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,500
They do have it!

1528
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:18,080
They do have it!

1529
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,400
Why didn't it show up when I did?

1530
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,960
Did I put a Japan-e-pack wrong?

1531
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:21,500
Whatever.

1532
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:21,580
Whatever.

1533
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,600
Wait, there's the parts in this that are just like...

1534
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,060
That have like the talking.

1535
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,560
It's okay, we'll do it.

1536
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,230
Oh wait, hold on.

1537
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,730
Welcome to the Japanese Park!

1538
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:03,690
We're back, we're back, we're back!

1539
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,950
A big commotion!

1540
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:06,230
Low battery?

1541
01:56:06,490 --> 01:56:07,010
Oh no!

1542
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:09,650
Go!

1543
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:13,850
If you laugh at me, I'll be your friend.

1544
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:15,070
Friend!

1545
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:19,310
Even if we fight, we're still friends.

1546
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:23,590
Even if there's a beast, there's no beast.

1547
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:24,510
Even if there's a monster, there's no monster.

1548
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:24,770
Even if there's a monster, there's no monster.

1549
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:27,650
The true love is right here.

1550
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:29,810
Come on, you too.

1551
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:32,530
Let's hold hands and go on a big adventure!

1552
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:36,970
Welcome to the Japanese Park!

1553
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:38,910
We're back, we're back, we're back!

1554
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:39,750
A big commotion!

1555
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:42,550
We're 12 different shapes and shapes.

1556
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:45,850
That's why we're attracted to each other.

1557
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:51,730
If you gently put your fingers on the night sky, we can start.

1558
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:53,990
We can start!

1559
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:54,530
Turn!

1560
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:57,130
I want to know more.

1561
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:05,280
If you turn around, over there, over here.

1562
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,340
Trouble!

1563
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:07,820
Trouble!

1564
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:11,040
No matter what it is, it's all over the newspaper.

1565
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,560
Congratulations on the beast.

1566
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,240
Everyone is living freely.

1567
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,760
That's right.

1568
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:23,340
You don't have to decorate yourself.

1569
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,440
It's okay.

1570
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,420
Here you go.

1571
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:26,660
Here you go.

1572
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,400
Thank you!

1573
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,680
Always, always, always, always

1574
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:44,450
until the morning.

1575
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:45,470
But...

1576
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:47,250
I want to keep

1577
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:53,960
going.

1578
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:55,380
Something, something.

1579
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:57,760
It's fun.

1580
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:58,860
Amazing.

1581
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,200
Ah, ah, ah.

1582
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:02,280
I'll go.

1583
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:04,180
Ah, hururu.

1584
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,040
Someday, someday else.

1585
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,200
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1586
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:10,380
Oh, let's go to the west.

1587
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:11,780
Let's go to the west.

1588
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,400
Let's go to the west.

1589
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,220
Let's go to the west.

1590
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:49,180
Yay!

1591
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:53,880
Oh, we go up to the Japanesewow!

1592
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:57,220
La, la, la, la...

1593
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:58,540
Let's be friends.

1594
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,940
La, la, la, la...!

1595
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:05,120
Welcome to the Japanesewow!

1596
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:05,780
Japanesewow!

1597
01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:23,330
I got caught in the crossfires of wanting to do the calls and needing to sing the song.

1598
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:25,670
Yay!

1599
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:26,990
That was Japari Park!

1600
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:33,770
Yay!

1601
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,730
There's another song I want to sing, actually.

1602
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:40,750
I think... I hope that they have backing vocals for this.

1603
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:44,950
If they don't, it will be a tough song.

1604
01:59:45,230 --> 01:59:47,110
But I've always loved this song.

1605
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:51,130
Love this song so much!

1606
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:56,210
Can you guys guess from just putting in this?

1607
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:57,170
I wonder...

1608
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:59,170
I wonder...

1609
01:59:59,170 --> 01:59:59,590
Oh?

1610
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:01,510
Oh?

1611
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:01,890
Oh?

1612
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,040
Ringo!

1613
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:08,760
Makire!

1614
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:10,900
Beeeeeeam!

1615
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,260
My soul is healed.

1616
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,990
It's from Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei.

1617
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:47,030
Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei Sayonara

1618
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:55,960
Zetsubou -sensei Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei

1619
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:04,700
You're like that Tabii tomato beside It's sure Shangri-la I'm with you.

1620
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,240
She was beautiful.

1621
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:10,910
Goodbye.icy I'm not!

1622
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:11,810
Sometimes,

1623
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:23,320
people have to beари It's got to be the pers coaches.

1624
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:10,820
I want to do a duet with that song so bad one day.

1625
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,850
Let's change the vibes a little bit.

1626
02:05:30,350 --> 02:05:32,290
Let's change the vibes a little bit.

1627
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:35,910
Actually... actually... oh gosh, what was that song called?

1628
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:37,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1629
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:38,190
I have to look it up.

1630
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:38,930
Hold on, hold on.

1631
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,660
Someone mentioned Maria Halleck earlier.

1632
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:03,740
Now this is a cover... well, rather the song ending is a cover.

1633
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:07,860
But...

1634
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,720
What is this?

1635
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:16,560
But we'll do the YMO version.

1636
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,420
I think I might have to pitch it up though.

1637
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:21,620
Actually, I kind of want to... do they have the... do they have...

1638
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,440
Do they have the Maria Halleck version?

1639
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:24,740
I wonder.

1640
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:45,470
This is it.

1641
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:46,590
Maria Halleck version.

1642
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:49,530
It's a little bit faster, so it's like...

1643
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:51,490
A little more energetic.

1644
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:58,110
Oh, wait.

1645
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:09,250
Because it's pretty different.

1646
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:11,650
I don't think I've ever sung the Maria Halleck version.

1647
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:12,710
Only just the...

1648
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:16,070
YMO isn't Boomer?

1649
02:07:17,230 --> 02:07:17,830
What?

1650
02:07:19,730 --> 02:07:20,190
What?

1651
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:22,110
Huh?

1652
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:30,540
I think that's the most Boomer you can get.

1653
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,780
I think that's the most Boomer you can get.

1654
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,360
I love this cover so much though.

1655
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:40,680
It's so cute.

1656
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,460
My heart is beating for you.

1657
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:50,620
Kyun!

1658
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,440
Kyun!

1659
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:56,500
My story.

1660
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:59,680
I'm holding my hand.

1661
02:08:01,010 --> 02:08:02,940
My heart is beating for you.

1662
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:02,940
Kyun!

1663
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:03,620
Kyun!

1664
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:05,460
My heart is beating for you.

1665
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,620
Kyun!

1666
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:07,620
Kyun!

1667
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:07,700
It's so scary.

1668
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:11,580
I'm being read.

1669
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:17,540
A rumbling line dance.

1670
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:23,660
Just breaking time.

1671
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,440
Just breaking time.

1672
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,160
The voltage in my eyes.

1673
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:35,300
While it's burning up.

1674
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:39,880
I have a heart for you.

1675
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,280
Kyun!

1676
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:40,640
Kyun!

1677
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:43,340
The cherry blossoms in summer.

1678
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:45,400
Just the sun.

1679
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:30,980
A little pause... and we are back.

1680
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:33,800
The

1681
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:53,290
original is so good, too, though.

1682
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:56,190
But I like the instrumentals in this one.

1683
02:12:27,970 --> 02:12:28,930
That was...

1684
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:34,530
You should watch the original music video if you've never seen it.

1685
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:35,310
The YMO version.

1686
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:38,070
Because it's so funny.

1687
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:39,470
The guys are so cute.

1688
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:41,570
They do, like, this cute pose.

1689
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:42,950
You couldn't tell.

1690
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:47,650
If I was in 3D, you'd be able to see me do the CUNE pose that they do in the music video.

1691
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,450
I do it every time.

1692
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:51,250
CUNE, CUNE, CUNE!

1693
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:52,830
So cute!

1694
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:56,850
Next song, I want to sing.

1695
02:12:58,050 --> 02:13:00,090
But I don't know how to find it.

1696
02:13:02,730 --> 02:13:04,490
I wonder if I can find it.

1697
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:10,590
I should find a chord also for my controller that's dying.

1698
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:21,360
One Night Carnival!

1699
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:22,980
I want to sing Kishidan!

1700
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:35,080
I want to sing it!

1701
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:43,250
It should be on here, I feel.

1702
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:45,130
Because...

1703
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:47,390
Because...

1704
02:13:47,890 --> 02:13:49,350
It's a popular Vocaloid song.

1705
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:52,530
One Night Carnival!

1706
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:55,370
But today...

1707
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:57,190
Well, this isn't technically Ani's song either.

1708
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:58,690
I keep showing up.

1709
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:03,430
I guess this song isn't technically Ani's song either, but...

1710
02:14:07,710 --> 02:14:08,310
Whatever.

1711
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:11,650
Vocaloid!

1712
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:13,990
It's kind of, you know?

1713
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:14,370
Whatever.

1714
02:15:05,890 --> 02:15:06,490
One Night Carnival!

1715
02:15:06,490 --> 02:15:06,790
One Night Carnival!

1716
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:07,650
Isn't

1717
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:22,680
that it?

1718
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,880
I love this song!

1719
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:25,320
A counterpoint.

1720
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:25,540
A counterpoint to my song.

1721
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:25,580
It's great.

1722
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:25,700
First, we have this.

1723
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:26,500
It's really good.

1724
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,320
Where did this song come from?

1725
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:34,320
It's called Gimmick!

1726
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,100
It's an android song.

1727
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:10,480
A little pause... and we are back.

1728
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,360
This music video is crazy.

1729
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,840
They were like, robot?

1730
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:30,740
Sure.

1731
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:09,700
They were like, robot?

1732
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:09,700
Sure.

1733
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:42,600
A little pause...

1734
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:42,600
and we are back.

1735
02:17:44,860 --> 02:18:12,360
A little pause... and we are back.

1736
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:12,120
A little pause... and we are back.

1737
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:13,700
Let's do another love song.

1738
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:15,140
Someone requested this earlier.

1739
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,320
It's technically anime.

1740
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:25,220
It's kind of anime.

1741
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,960
It's anime.

1742
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,720
It's Annie's song.

1743
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:31,400
It's Annie's song!

1744
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:34,920
Hold

1745
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:41,400
on.

1746
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:42,260
Set list.

1747
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:06,090
You don't say.

1748
02:20:09,550 --> 02:20:16,010
I don't know what you meant by that.

1749
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:17,170
I love it.

1750
02:20:19,470 --> 02:20:20,870
Ohterm funded?

1751
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:24,510
Yeah.

1752
02:21:07,810 --> 02:21:11,630
Sunny, be in love with you.

1753
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:18,130
I've

1754
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:25,740
already decided the number of eights.

1755
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:39,500
Tomorrow's dream will come to life.

1756
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:44,120
I want to you.

1757
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,540
Forever.

1758
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,440
Surely.

1759
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:52,440
Surely.

1760
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:53,440
Surely.

1761
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,400
Your

1762
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:13,440
gentle feelings are full.

1763
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:16,720
The first kiss.

1764
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:18,940
With you.

1765
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:24,120
I will give you all my love.

1766
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:27,120
The tears will fall.

1767
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:31,100
Really, in this habit.

1768
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:35,280
Sunny, be in love with you.

1769
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:43,500
This is like the one time it's a song about love.

1770
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:45,280
And they choose outer space.

1771
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,700
I'm so confused.

1772
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:50,040
The first kiss.

1773
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:51,860
With you.

1774
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:57,060
I will give you all my love.

1775
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,660
With you.

1776
02:22:58,660 --> 02:22:58,840
For some reason.

1777
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:03,880
Your gentle feelings are full.

1778
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:07,380
The first kiss.

1779
02:23:08,690 --> 02:23:09,600
With you.

1780
02:23:10,570 --> 02:23:14,520
I will give you all my love.

1781
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:16,480
For some reason.

1782
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:17,460
The tears will fall.

1783
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:20,380
Really, in this habit.

1784
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:25,660
You will just fall in love with you.

1785
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:29,880
With you.

1786
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:35,630
And still won't stop.

1787
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:36,410
Forever.

1788
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:41,770
Seriously.

1789
02:23:41,770 --> 02:23:42,530
Really, in this habit.

1790
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:43,370
Totally.

1791
02:23:43,810 --> 02:23:45,090
And you cannot think that someone else in this world can be as sweet and sweet as you are.

1792
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:45,130
My time.

1793
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:50,490
I will only be lovin' you too and too, you know.ári

1794
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:05,360
no claro Lovin' you?

1795
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:11,940
Say this to my cats.

1796
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:16,120
Yay!

1797
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:19,460
That was Hajimete na chu!

1798
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,640
Okay, since they chose space for this, I must see what they choose.

1799
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:28,460
I believe love can bloom on the battlefield.

1800
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:31,000
On the space battlefield.

1801
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:33,520
Someone requested this one earlier.

1802
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:40,580
It's been a long time since I've sung this one.

1803
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:42,460
The vibe is a little different, but it's also a love song.

1804
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,080
Kind of.

1805
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,380
Which one?

1806
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:00,040
We'll do this one.

1807
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:04,460
We'll see what they choose for the background of this.

1808
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:05,860
If it's not space, I'm gonna riot.

1809
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,380
Do you remember me?

1810
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:09,940
Do you remember me?

1811
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:14,470
Excuse me, Regina.

1812
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:17,350
Macross.

1813
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:18,950
Macross.

1814
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:21,490
It must be space.

1815
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:22,270
It must be space.

1816
02:25:22,330 --> 02:25:23,010
It must be space.

1817
02:25:23,070 --> 02:25:23,670
It must be space.

1818
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:24,210
Space!

1819
02:25:24,450 --> 02:25:24,810
Space!

1820
02:25:25,050 --> 02:25:25,370
Space!

1821
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:25,930
Space!

1822
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:26,470
Space!

1823
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,030
Space!

1824
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:29,330
What?!

1825
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:38,550
My disappointment is inevitable.

1826
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:44,770
yours are ruined Right now,

1827
02:25:53,330 --> 02:25:55,750
I can hear your voice.

1828
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:58,670
Please come back here.

1829
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:01,630
I'm in a sense of loss.

1830
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:12,590
I can see your figure.

1831
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:16,710
You are walking towards me.

1832
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:18,750
My eyes will close.

1833
02:26:21,950 --> 02:26:23,350
閉じて待っているわたしに

1834
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:40,430
昨日まで涙で曇ってた 心は今

1835
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:10,390
A little pause... and we are back.

1836
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:19,390
I'm surprised there's no chorus for this one, too.

1837
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:23,630
Maybe I should try a different version.

1838
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:29,270
I wish I had so much better with the chorus in the background.

1839
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:59,420
for instance deserves a new year.

1840
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:09,420
No more open source.

1841
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:10,380
Oh, we're dancing along!

1842
02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:15,110
Yeah!

1843
02:28:25,970 --> 02:28:27,370
世界は今

1844
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:39,370
覚えていますか 目と目が合った時も

1845
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:55,530
覚えていますか 手と手が触れ合った時 This is the first time we are going on a journey of love.

1846
02:28:57,750 --> 02:29:00,590
I love you so.

1847
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:08,050
Because I'm not alone anymore.

1848
02:29:16,130 --> 02:29:21,980
Do you remember?

1849
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:26,040
The time when our eyes met.

1850
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:30,820
Do you remember?

1851
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:35,000
The time when our hands touched.

1852
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:44,380
This was the first time we were going on a journey of love.

1853
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:49,400
I love you so.

1854
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:03,510
Because I'm not alone anymore.

1855
02:30:08,790 --> 02:30:11,390
Because you are here.

1856
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:13,290
This

1857
02:30:20,130 --> 02:30:22,410
is the first time we are going on a journey of love.

1858
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:42,390
They cut off the end.

1859
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:43,050
What the heck?

1860
02:30:44,770 --> 02:30:46,990
They were like, no 7-minute song for you.

1861
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,760
I'm going through the list of songs that people requested.

1862
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:04,280
I wonder

1863
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:17,130
if I can put it under here.

1864
02:31:19,150 --> 02:31:20,070
That's a little short one.

1865
02:31:21,730 --> 02:31:23,390
Wait, this is a different person though.

1866
02:31:23,530 --> 02:31:24,090
It's called Akumi.

1867
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:30,270
Thank you!

1868
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:35,690
First time hearing you sing?

1869
02:31:35,870 --> 02:31:37,730
I wasn't familiar with your game.

1870
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:41,130
What is this?

1871
02:31:41,130 --> 02:31:41,450
It's called the suger song.

1872
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:45,210
I never heard this before.

1873
02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,570
I actually don't...

1874
02:31:47,570 --> 02:31:48,910
I only know the course of it.

1875
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:50,970
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

1876
02:31:51,370 --> 02:31:52,050
Oh, wait.

1877
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:53,430
Will this work?

1878
02:31:54,910 --> 02:31:55,570
I don't know...

1879
02:31:55,570 --> 02:31:57,030
I don't know what this version is like.

1880
02:31:57,090 --> 02:31:57,770
I want to do the original.

1881
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:02,790
Okay, let's do the...

1882
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:03,970
Let's do the...

1883
02:32:04,610 --> 02:32:06,050
Kyu kyu kyu...

1884
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:09,390
Kyu kyu kyu...

1885
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:14,190
Kyu kyu...

1886
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:18,450
Te te te....

1887
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:20,090
Te te..

1888
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:23,110
wait, sorry, te te...

1889
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:25,410
Cutee!

1890
02:32:26,130 --> 02:32:27,370
It's little...

1891
02:32:29,290 --> 02:32:30,410
Cutie honey!

1892
02:32:32,930 --> 02:32:33,770
Cutie Honey!

1893
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:34,810
Cutie Honey!

1894
02:32:34,850 --> 02:32:35,290
Kodakumi!

1895
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:37,370
This is the one I want to sing.

1896
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:50,630
Have I ever sung this song before on stream?

1897
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:00,760
Space!

1898
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:24,620
What are you doing?

1899
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:32,700
Please, please, don't hurt me.

1900
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:37,460
My heart is pounding.

1901
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:43,560
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to look at you.

1902
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:46,940
Honey Flash!

1903
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:16,470
Please, please, don't hurt me.

1904
02:34:16,490 --> 02:34:19,230
Please, please, don't come any closer.

1905
02:34:20,390 --> 02:34:23,750
My heart is pounding.

1906
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:30,270
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to look at you.

1907
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:33,690
Honey Flash!

1908
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,380
What's up?

1909
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:08,400
Please,

1910
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:17,450
please, don't hurt me.

1911
02:35:18,630 --> 02:35:19,470
Because...

1912
02:35:24,870 --> 02:35:29,530
Please, please, don't come any closer.

1913
02:35:31,430 --> 02:35:33,810
My heart is pounding.

1914
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:40,630
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to look at you.

1915
02:35:42,690 --> 02:35:43,810
Honey Flash!

1916
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,100
Oh, I completely forgot the ending!

1917
02:35:52,550 --> 02:35:53,950
I'm so sorry.

1918
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:55,450
Oh my gosh, what did she say at the end?

1919
02:35:55,850 --> 02:35:56,410
Um...

1920
02:35:57,830 --> 02:35:58,770
I forgot what the...

1921
02:35:58,770 --> 02:35:59,690
Oh, fumbled completely.

1922
02:36:02,390 --> 02:36:02,890
I'm going to die.

1923
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:07,470
I completely fumbled the ending.

1924
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:08,550
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1925
02:36:09,010 --> 02:36:09,410
Yay!

1926
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:10,770
Cutie Honey!

1927
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:13,750
Cutie Honey!

1928
02:36:14,210 --> 02:36:15,010
Cutie Honey!

1929
02:36:15,930 --> 02:36:16,730
Cutie Honey!

1930
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:17,550
Cutie Honey!

1931
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:21,810
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1932
02:36:22,470 --> 02:36:23,490
All right, all right.

1933
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:24,630
What other songs?

1934
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:25,530
I have so many more.

1935
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:26,650
How many songs?

1936
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:26,990
How long?

1937
02:36:27,090 --> 02:36:27,850
Two and a half hours?

1938
02:36:28,010 --> 02:36:28,210
Okay.

1939
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:29,750
Let's do...

1940
02:36:35,370 --> 02:36:36,330
The book.

1941
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:37,190
We're in a...

1942
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:38,550
We're on a love streak, clearly.

1943
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:42,090
He...

1944
02:36:42,090 --> 02:36:43,130
Nah.

1945
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:45,590
Literally, my childhood is Love Hina.

1946
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:47,470
I watched Love Hina.

1947
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:49,710
I read Love Hina.

1948
02:36:50,270 --> 02:36:52,590
Everything in my childhood was Love Hina.

1949
02:36:52,970 --> 02:36:53,810
But I...

1950
02:36:53,810 --> 02:36:55,090
I grew up...

1951
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,910
Everything...

1952
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:57,310
So bad.

1953
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:58,910
It's Love Hina.

1954
02:36:58,910 --> 02:36:58,990
It's Love Hina.

1955
02:36:58,990 --> 02:36:59,030
Love Hina.

1956
02:36:59,350 --> 02:36:59,990
Wait.

1957
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:01,330
Tamara Yukari...

1958
02:37:01,330 --> 02:37:02,510
Who did she voice?

1959
02:37:05,150 --> 02:37:07,950
That was the Mint Wrestle Cutie Honey ending.

1960
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:10,730
That explains a lot.

1961
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:12,030
What are you talking about?

1962
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:14,550
Oh.

1963
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:15,870
There's so many songs.

1964
02:37:16,330 --> 02:37:17,070
Sakura-Saku?

1965
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:19,390
What was the ending?

1966
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:20,810
Winter Wish?

1967
02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:26,730
I don't know what to wish!

1968
02:37:26,730 --> 02:37:28,650
Sakura Sakuya is the opening, but...

1969
02:37:30,570 --> 02:37:30,970
Wait!

1970
02:37:31,270 --> 02:37:32,530
There's a song I want to sing!

1971
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:33,470
Okay, I'll do this.

1972
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:34,930
Hold on, let me write it down so I don't forget.

1973
02:37:38,670 --> 02:37:40,070
There's a reason I want to sing it too.

1974
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:43,950
Hayashibara Megumi!

1975
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:44,910
Who was she?

1976
02:37:45,550 --> 02:37:48,690
Of course, Ho-chan does so many songs because she was Naru.

1977
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:50,490
You get the burning?

1978
02:37:50,590 --> 02:37:51,850
I have no disco on the list.

1979
02:37:52,410 --> 02:37:54,530
Love Hina was the first manga I read front to back.

1980
02:37:54,730 --> 02:37:55,750
I loved Love Hina.

1981
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:56,890
I loved A.I.

1982
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:57,350
Love You.

1983
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:59,090
I loved...

1984
02:37:59,850 --> 02:38:01,050
The Christmas one.

1985
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:04,310
I didn't actually read so much of Negima, but...

1986
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:06,590
Akamatsu Ken kind of raised me.

1987
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:10,250
Actually...

1988
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:11,310
Happy Material!

1989
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:13,010
Oh yes, I'll do Happy Material.

1990
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:18,530
Wait, I sang Happy Material earlier.

1991
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:19,790
Or like, recently.

1992
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:20,190
I don't know.

1993
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:23,110
Friendship is such a cute song, but it's like kind of...

1994
02:38:23,110 --> 02:38:24,030
And Smile Smile...

1995
02:38:24,030 --> 02:38:26,190
Oh my gosh, I think I might cry if I hear this song.

1996
02:38:27,450 --> 02:38:29,010
Oh, 2001 version!

1997
02:38:29,530 --> 02:38:31,890
Oh my gosh, I might cry.

1998
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:32,610
Yakusoku!

1999
02:38:35,550 --> 02:38:36,370
How does it start?

2000
02:38:45,250 --> 02:38:47,810
Wait, no, I don't think so.

2001
02:38:55,350 --> 02:38:56,510
Is this Yakusoku?

2002
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:58,550
I love my otaku palment.

2003
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:02,410
Thanks to Kao!

2004
02:39:06,790 --> 02:39:08,170
Okay, I'll try the opening.

2005
02:39:08,750 --> 02:39:11,550
I'll try the opening, even though it's kind of insane.

2006
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:22,790
Sakuu, not the first sakura song we sang today.

2007
02:39:24,190 --> 02:39:24,870
Oh, wait.

2008
02:39:25,530 --> 02:39:26,010
Sakuu...

2009
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:28,630
I can't believe Hayashibana Megumi did this song.

2010
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:29,230
That's crazy.

2011
02:39:29,930 --> 02:39:30,410
What?

2012
02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:35,090
That's crazy.

2013
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:37,590
Oh gosh, I already feel like I'm not gonna...

2014
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:39,530
I'm not gonna be able to sing this at all.

2015
02:39:40,910 --> 02:39:42,730
She was Haruka, the cousin who ran...

2016
02:39:42,730 --> 02:39:42,830
Oh!

2017
02:39:43,850 --> 02:39:43,890
Oh!

2018
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:20,580
On the roof The sky is red The sun is shining I look up at the sky My body is full of energy I'm overflowing with energy That's so wonderful I'm alive I can't stop I can't give up Why?

2019
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:46,420
Goodbye to yesterday I gave you so long ago This feeling is rising up I'll revive it again and again I'll revive it again and again Let me bloom flowers Memories are always a sweet place to run away Memories are always a sweet place to run away To live tomorrow The time of blessing is coming Stretch out your hand Creepy girl.

2020
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:49,800
What is this killer child?

2021
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:51,120
What is this killer child?

2022
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:52,740
What is this killer child?

2023
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:03,360
The soft and soft skin of the softness I still close my hands Oh my gosh.

2024
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:32,620
If I close my eyes, the image blooms The fruit of the charm That's so wonderful I'm alive I can't stop I want to see the future Haha The days of the earth continue No matter where I go Heaven and hell I'll never go back I'll revive it again and again Let me bloom flowers Run,

2025
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:47,080
run, until I find love If you suffer with that The place you wish for The time of blessing is coming Stretch out your hand A little

2026
02:41:50,270 --> 02:41:50,270
pause...

2027
02:41:50,270 --> 02:41:54,510
and we will吧 I'm shocked we're still getting new videos I'm shocked we're still getting new videos Why are we at the grass now?

2028
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:56,230
What's going on?

2029
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:08,600
And I still love Loving Hina I still love Loving Hina I still love Loving Hina Get up A kiss A touch A kiss A touch

2030
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:18,720
A kiss

2031
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:40,760
Yeah, I love NaRu the most.

2032
02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:41,840
How'd you know?

2033
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:47,380
Creepy little girl, creepy little girl.

2034
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:50,160
Creepy little girl, creepy little girl.

2035
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:53,240
It's nostalgic, isn't it?

2036
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:54,800
Natsukashii!

2037
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:57,160
Oh my god, oh my god.

2038
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:59,540
She's touching grass, for real.

2039
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:02,000
Let's go, little girl!

2040
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:05,980
Okay, let's do some more nostalgic songs.

2041
02:43:08,140 --> 02:43:08,880
This is four.

2042
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:12,280
Wait, didn't I?

2043
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:12,480
Oh!

2044
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:14,020
I wanted to do this song.

2045
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:14,900
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2046
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:15,840
I changed my mind.

2047
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:17,960
This one is...

2048
02:43:18,380 --> 02:43:20,560
I think actually this one is kind of...

2049
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:21,980
also nostalgic.

2050
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:24,260
It's nostalgic for me.

2051
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:28,280
And it's also composed by one of my favorite composers ever.

2052
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:28,740
So...

2053
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:34,820
And also, the reason I want to sing it is because it was trending earlier because the manga is currently free.

2054
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:35,740
Wait.

2055
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:41,820
I love this song too, though.

2056
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:51,760
Wait, I'm thinking of a different song.

2057
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:52,320
Nevermind.

2058
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:57,880
Maybe, wait.

2059
02:43:58,640 --> 02:43:59,240
Hold on.

2060
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:05,270
Um...

2061
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:08,070
I...

2062
02:44:08,070 --> 02:44:09,390
There's another song.

2063
02:44:09,770 --> 02:44:11,850
It's on the same single as...

2064
02:44:13,410 --> 02:44:16,470
Furendo Shitai, but I can't remember what the B-side is.

2065
02:44:16,830 --> 02:44:18,550
Anyways, it's Gakkou Gurashi!

2066
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:21,130
You guys remember this song?

2067
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:29,260
What was the...

2068
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:32,580
What was the...

2069
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:36,580
I can't remember how this opening goes.

2070
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:37,580
I only actually...

2071
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:40,040
Maybe I only remember the lyrics or the chorus.

2072
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:41,180
Uh-oh, maybe I should've...

2073
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:46,100
I love this song.

2074
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:46,860
Or I love this show.

2075
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,460
I love this song.

2076
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:52,020
Ah, here we go.

2077
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:56,800
If you want to do it, if you want to do it, you want to do it when you want to, right?

2078
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:58,120
Together, yes!

2079
02:44:59,020 --> 02:44:59,840
We are here.

2080
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:03,040
There is a dream here.

2081
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:07,480
If you're a friend, you're a friend, right?

2082
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:07,740
That's right!

2083
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:26,260
How

2084
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:57,120
do I say it?

2085
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:26,150
Oh, wait.

2086
02:46:26,210 --> 02:46:27,050
How does the full version go?

2087
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:42,280
That's right!

2088
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:42,340
That's right!

2089
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:42,820
That's right!

2090
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:43,520
That's right!

2091
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:44,900
That's right!

2092
02:46:56,770 --> 02:46:57,410
That's right!

2093
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:21,380
That's right!

2094
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:21,620
Zombie!

2095
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:22,000
Zombie!

2096
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:22,340
Zombie!

2097
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:22,680
Zombie!

2098
02:48:23,420 --> 02:48:24,420
Everybody's a zombie!

2099
02:48:25,540 --> 02:48:26,140
Yay!

2100
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:30,300
Furen shitai!

2101
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:32,280
From Gakkou Gurashi!

2102
02:48:34,540 --> 02:48:35,300
From Gakkou Gurashi!

2103
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:37,360
The other song on the B-side of that is so cute too.

2104
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:51,320
The other song on the B-side of that is so cute too.

2105
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:51,740
Ta-da!

2106
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:55,300
I wonder if I can search it through.

2107
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:56,680
Just searching komugi.

2108
02:48:57,860 --> 02:49:00,920
Someone asked for me to sing the Kom Su Su Tod song.

2109
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:03,320
Maybe I should do that.

2110
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:13,020
Isn't this technically any song?

2111
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:18,100
Isn't this technically any song?

2112
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:24,280
It counts!

2113
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:27,440
It's like the one English song we'll sing today.

2114
02:49:29,780 --> 02:49:30,680
Kom Su Su Tod.

2115
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:51,960
Su Su harmonica man Play it!

2116
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:53,720
Play that harmonica!

2117
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:55,380
I want to hear it!

2118
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:56,280
Tod!

2119
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:58,500
Play it!

2120
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:00,440
My favorite song.

2121
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:01,140
Go!

2122
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:01,480
Ya!

2123
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:02,180
Here we go!

2124
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:18,480
Maybe I should have I don't even know how many songs I've sung!

2125
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:21,100
Are you guys having fun?

2126
02:50:21,340 --> 02:50:23,540
Are you guys liking the karaoke a little bit?

2127
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,780
I hope so.

2128
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:27,680
I hope I sound alright today.

2129
02:50:29,100 --> 02:51:39,480
I know, I know I've let you down I've been a fool to myself I thought that I couldn't live for no one else But now, through all the hurt and pain It's time for me to respect The ones you love mean more than anything So with sadness in my heart I feel the best thing I could do Is end it all and leave forever What's done is done It feels so bad What's once was happy now is sad I'll never love again My world is ending I wish that I could turn back time Cause now the guilt is all mine Can't live without the trust from those you love I know we can't forget

2130
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:54,080
Broadway?

2131
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:54,300
I wish that I could turn back time.

2132
02:52:54,740 --> 02:52:57,460
Cause now the guilt is all mine.

2133
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:02,340
Can't live without the trust from those you love.

2134
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:07,040
I know we can't forget the past.

2135
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:10,200
You can't forget love and pride.

2136
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:14,920
Because of that it's kill... killing me inside.

2137
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:17,180
It's killing me.

2138
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:23,420
Where's like... where are my backup singers at?

2139
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:27,220
Where are my backup singers at?

2140
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:33,000
It all returns to nothing.

2141
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:38,960
It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.

2142
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:45,840
It all returns to nothing.

2143
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:52,040
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down.

2144
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:58,640
It all returns to nothing.

2145
02:53:59,180 --> 02:54:04,400
It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.

2146
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:11,420
It all returns to nothing.

2147
02:54:11,940 --> 02:54:15,820
I just keep letting me down, letting me down.

2148
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:19,820
How old do you think this footage is?

2149
02:54:43,860 --> 02:54:44,460
We

2150
02:55:25,380 --> 02:55:26,800
all return to nothing.

2151
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:39,900
Nice.

2152
02:55:41,820 --> 02:55:42,480
Goodbye world!

2153
02:55:46,060 --> 02:55:46,660
Uninstall!

2154
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:49,940
Oh my gosh, yes!

2155
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:50,560
Uninstall!

2156
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:53,180
Wait, can I put it in?

2157
02:55:56,980 --> 02:55:57,620
In English?

2158
02:56:14,920 --> 02:56:16,640
Maybe if I search Bokurano, right?

2159
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:18,380
Grateful friends.

2160
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:19,640
I was listening to it during lockdown.

2161
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:20,860
How to look it up was bugging me.

2162
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:21,760
Oh, thank you!

2163
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:22,660
Grateful friends.

2164
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:27,780
What if I put in Bokurano?

2165
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:30,440
Cool.

2166
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:34,200
Isn't that also written in Romaji do Boku?

2167
02:56:35,360 --> 02:56:36,260
Oh, wait.

2168
02:56:40,500 --> 02:56:43,140
I just realized it probably will give us like a bunch of stuff.

2169
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:45,300
Probably.

2170
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:48,780
Oh, it's there!

2171
02:56:49,180 --> 02:56:49,580
Yippee!

2172
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:54,060
Oh gosh, I have to remember.

2173
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:55,680
Test.

2174
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:04,900
Test.

2175
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:11,720
This karaoke sounds ancient.

2176
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:15,940
You know how like some karaoke sound more recently made?

2177
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:17,740
This sounds ancient.

2178
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:19,480
Kana

2179
02:57:39,280 --> 02:57:54,620
Toke Saiko no Riyaru ga Mukokara wa Ae ni Kitetta no Wa Bokurano Sonzai wa Konnani mo Tanjun da to Warai ni Kita nana

2180
02:57:58,740 --> 02:58:00,760
Wait, the timing is really off.

2181
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:52,160
Oh, this girl is so cute!

2182
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:54,240
Yeah, ita!

2183
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:00,380
He framed it!

2184
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:35,220
I can't speak.

2185
03:00:21,870 --> 03:00:22,350
Iris!

2186
03:00:22,890 --> 03:00:24,310
You have to do it!

2187
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:05,500
You have to do it!

2188
03:01:35,960 --> 03:01:37,580
Oh wait, I missed my big Q.

2189
03:01:37,720 --> 03:01:38,100
Hold on.

2190
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:40,100
I missed my Q.

2191
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:41,300
Hold on.

2192
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:43,260
I missed my Q.

2193
03:01:43,320 --> 03:01:43,640
Hold on.

2194
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:45,020
I missed my Q.

2195
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:49,020
Okay, I'm... I'm... I'm...

2196
03:01:49,460 --> 03:01:50,220
Oh my gosh!

2197
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:53,540
Oh my gosh!

2198
03:01:53,540 --> 03:01:55,220
You guys...

2199
03:01:56,380 --> 03:01:56,820
Goodbye!

2200
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:11,320
Just kidding.

2201
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:15,220
Just kidding.

2202
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:18,000
I still want to sing some more.

2203
03:02:18,380 --> 03:02:19,100
Oh my gosh.

2204
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:20,360
Oh my gosh.

2205
03:02:20,380 --> 03:02:21,620
I just messed up everything.

2206
03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:24,560
I just messed up my entire setup.

2207
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:25,000
No!

2208
03:02:26,060 --> 03:02:26,920
What just happened?

2209
03:02:34,970 --> 03:02:35,850
I think I'm better.

2210
03:02:42,290 --> 03:02:43,810
I became big for a second.

2211
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:45,310
Landscape mode.

2212
03:02:48,630 --> 03:02:49,350
Landscape mode!

2213
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:50,550
Okay.

2214
03:02:51,890 --> 03:02:52,410
Let's see.

2215
03:02:53,350 --> 03:02:53,870
Let's see.

2216
03:02:54,150 --> 03:02:57,450
Okay, I did say I was going to sing this earlier and I got distracted.

2217
03:02:58,030 --> 03:02:58,990
I will sing it now.

2218
03:02:59,570 --> 03:03:01,130
Oh wait, let's actually...

2219
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:03,690
Do it from...

2220
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:04,590
Na...

2221
03:03:07,090 --> 03:03:07,570
Na...

2222
03:03:08,830 --> 03:03:09,310
Su...

2223
03:03:09,850 --> 03:03:12,250
Actually, I sang Nurse Switch Kamugi before.

2224
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:14,350
Maybe I should sing Popo-tan this time.

2225
03:03:14,510 --> 03:03:14,990
Actually...

2226
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:18,270
Maybe I'll sing a different Nurse Switch Kamugi song if they have one.

2227
03:03:18,330 --> 03:03:18,810
Hold on, let's see.

2228
03:03:18,970 --> 03:03:19,270
Na...

2229
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:22,190
Na...

2230
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:24,550
Na...

2231
03:03:24,550 --> 03:03:25,430
Su...

2232
03:03:26,330 --> 03:03:26,810
U...

2233
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:28,210
U...

2234
03:03:28,210 --> 03:03:29,130
Ichi...

2235
03:03:30,430 --> 03:03:30,910
Oh!

2236
03:03:32,970 --> 03:03:34,310
Let me just search Nurse.

2237
03:03:35,370 --> 03:03:35,730
Nice!

2238
03:03:47,450 --> 03:03:48,350
Okay, they have that one.

2239
03:03:48,590 --> 03:03:49,330
Why did it...

2240
03:03:49,330 --> 03:03:49,610
When I...

2241
03:03:49,610 --> 03:03:50,850
Oh, maybe because it's the Chisa...

2242
03:03:51,330 --> 03:03:51,690
Chisa...

2243
03:03:51,690 --> 03:03:52,050
Ui.

2244
03:03:52,290 --> 03:03:52,870
It's Ui.

2245
03:03:54,150 --> 03:03:55,230
I can't just put the U.

2246
03:03:55,250 --> 03:03:55,890
I have to put the Ui.

2247
03:03:57,530 --> 03:03:57,890
U...

2248
03:03:58,930 --> 03:03:59,290
Ui.

2249
03:04:01,030 --> 03:04:01,610
There we go.

2250
03:04:05,330 --> 03:04:06,390
You are shocked!

2251
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:11,490
I can't remember all of you.

2252
03:04:11,510 --> 03:04:12,730
I only know you are shocked.

2253
03:04:14,290 --> 03:04:17,290
So there's I Know Medicine, but I wanna do...

2254
03:04:17,290 --> 03:04:20,650
I always sing I Know Medicine, so this time I'm gonna sing an insert song from Nurse Switch Kamugi.

2255
03:04:21,210 --> 03:04:22,930
I hate you so much!

2256
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:35,940
We've sang too many songs about love today.

2257
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:37,920
Oh, wait.

2258
03:04:37,960 --> 03:04:38,640
I hate you so much.

2259
03:04:54,670 --> 03:04:55,630
I hate you so much.

2260
03:04:56,950 --> 03:04:58,910
I can't even remember...

2261
03:04:58,910 --> 03:05:01,530
clue I know.

2262
03:05:02,330 --> 03:05:03,310
Now I can't that type of thing anymore.

2263
03:05:03,310 --> 03:05:04,370
Oh, did you change your way of thinking?

2264
03:05:04,370 --> 03:05:05,770
Annoying face, stupid face, bad design commands.

2265
03:05:06,380 --> 03:05:08,130
I melted and I settled in all of you...

2266
03:05:08,130 --> 03:05:08,450
Iyyy...

2267
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:09,250
duh...

2268
03:05:09,250 --> 03:05:09,730
I can't understand...

2269
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:12,970
All of these feelings.

2270
03:05:13,030 --> 03:05:14,010
I can't nope.

2271
03:05:14,010 --> 03:05:14,730
I'll just make change and make them into good things.

2272
03:05:14,730 --> 03:05:18,530
Dist核, guitar!

2273
03:05:18,570 --> 03:05:18,690
Miss...

2274
03:05:20,610 --> 03:05:21,590
I love you...

2275
03:05:24,730 --> 03:05:25,710
James!

2276
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:20,220
Oh,

2277
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:57,150
I should have had this face on the whole time.

2278
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:03,850
This is my... this is my song for...

2279
03:08:03,850 --> 03:08:05,730
I hate you!

2280
03:08:06,810 --> 03:08:08,290
I hate you!

2281
03:08:12,210 --> 03:08:13,410
Sing it again?

2282
03:08:14,050 --> 03:08:14,570
Okay.

2283
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:20,760
It's not that long of a song.

2284
03:08:21,040 --> 03:08:21,520
Okay.

2285
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:24,640
One more time, but actually hating you.

2286
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:28,600
One more time, but actually... POV, she really hates you.

2287
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:31,380
And doesn't think that you will become a psycho couple.

2288
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:33,960
I mean...

2289
03:08:37,540 --> 03:08:38,060
Oh,

2290
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:43,380
stay away from me, I hate you!

2291
03:09:40,230 --> 03:09:41,690
It's not that long of a song.

2292
03:09:41,850 --> 03:09:42,970
A little

2293
03:10:13,230 --> 03:10:14,230
pause...

2294
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,750
and we are back.

2295
03:10:17,010 --> 03:10:21,850
This is my... this is my song for...

2296
03:10:21,850 --> 03:10:26,150
I hate you!

2297
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:26,150
I hate you!

2298
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:27,510
And this is my... this is my song for...

2299
03:10:29,150 --> 03:10:32,330
I hate you!

2300
03:10:32,910 --> 03:10:33,550
I hate you!

2301
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:37,410
And doesn't think that you will become a psycho couple.

2302
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:24,440
One more time...

2303
03:11:28,880 --> 03:11:31,120
This video is the best one!

2304
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:37,770
So glad we got this one.

2305
03:11:37,890 --> 03:11:40,330
I'm so glad we did this song again to get this video.

2306
03:11:40,610 --> 03:11:41,850
What is going on?

2307
03:11:42,770 --> 03:11:43,910
Oh my god!

2308
03:11:44,330 --> 03:11:48,180
I got 10 times more...

2309
03:11:48,180 --> 03:11:52,220
Oh my god, the b-ball couple.

2310
03:11:53,340 --> 03:11:54,480
These bros cooked.

2311
03:11:54,620 --> 03:11:55,500
The b-ball couple.

2312
03:11:55,580 --> 03:11:56,300
They are too strong.

2313
03:12:01,120 --> 03:12:03,340
B-ball, b-ball, b-ball, b-ball.

2314
03:12:06,420 --> 03:12:07,740
Okay, let's see...

2315
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:09,960
So that was my kumugi.

2316
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:15,760
I'll save Popotan for another day since I did kumugi twice in a row.

2317
03:12:32,170 --> 03:12:33,150
Yosakoi, yosakoi!

2318
03:12:36,290 --> 03:12:38,230
This is from the anime Hanayamada.

2319
03:12:40,130 --> 03:12:42,730
Hana wa odore ya irohani ho.

2320
03:12:42,970 --> 03:12:45,110
I always struggle with singing this song though.

2321
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,570
Oh wait...

2322
03:12:47,570 --> 03:12:56,570
Hana wa odore ya irohani ho.

2323
03:13:02,530 --> 03:13:04,810
Okay, such a cute anime, I know right?

2324
03:13:05,550 --> 03:13:06,110
Yay!

2325
03:13:08,230 --> 03:13:08,550
I watched it earlier.

2326
03:13:10,690 --> 03:13:11,690
Can you do the dance?

2327
03:13:11,730 --> 03:13:11,970
I can!

2328
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:13,490
I actually do know the dance.

2329
03:13:15,370 --> 03:13:16,470
I actually do.

2330
03:13:17,010 --> 03:13:17,990
For real, for real.

2331
03:13:18,470 --> 03:13:20,030
One day in 3D I'll show you.

2332
03:13:21,050 --> 03:13:21,490
Monaka!

2333
03:13:21,750 --> 03:13:23,590
Oh my gosh, no wonder this song is awesome.

2334
03:14:00,250 --> 03:14:07,050
I honestly love this song.

2335
03:14:07,050 --> 03:14:07,070
I'll show you.

2336
03:14:07,070 --> 03:14:08,330
So what does it say?

2337
03:14:08,330 --> 03:14:16,610
It says, This is a new genre where the group is very different.

2338
03:14:16,610 --> 03:14:17,090
So I've been thinking about choosing the genre of popular songs.

2339
03:14:17,090 --> 03:15:04,150
Kazoetai atarashii keshiki Iroha ni ho pato pato hare yaka ni sakasemashou Hana no you ni kore kara no kimi ga mitai Iroha ni ho pato pato hare yaka ni sakaseru omoi o tsurenareru A little pause... and we are back.

2340
03:15:15,810 --> 03:15:42,290
A little pause... and we are back.

2341
03:15:42,310 --> 03:16:10,130
A little pause... and we are back.

2342
03:16:27,150 --> 03:16:51,050
A little pause... and we are back.

2343
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:29,090
A little pause... and we are back.

2344
03:17:29,110 --> 03:17:30,290
I don't want to lose you.

2345
03:17:53,390 --> 03:17:54,250
I

2346
03:18:00,130 --> 03:18:23,930
don't want to lose you.

2347
03:18:28,130 --> 03:18:30,370
She went to heaven before us, so...

2348
03:18:35,530 --> 03:18:37,450
It brought back a lot of memories.

2349
03:18:38,450 --> 03:18:39,310
All of a sudden.

2350
03:18:50,230 --> 03:18:50,670
Poro!

2351
03:18:50,750 --> 03:18:51,850
Thanks for the birthday gift!

2352
03:18:52,010 --> 03:18:52,670
Thank you!

2353
03:18:59,570 --> 03:19:01,650
In fact, I'm gonna sing a song for her.

2354
03:19:09,720 --> 03:19:12,000
Hold on, I just gotta make sure I get the name right.

2355
03:19:12,400 --> 03:19:15,180
I think I remember it, but...

2356
03:19:18,080 --> 03:19:18,440
Uh...

2357
03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:20,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2358
03:19:20,940 --> 03:19:21,680
Okay, I was right.

2359
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:43,500
It should be this one, I think?

2360
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:49,020
I'm actually not so sure about the kanji.

2361
03:19:49,480 --> 03:19:50,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2362
03:19:50,320 --> 03:19:50,620
There we go.

2363
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:50,820
Okay.

2364
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:55,780
Um...

2365
03:19:56,620 --> 03:19:56,980
I...

2366
03:19:58,140 --> 03:20:01,200
Don't remember exactly the full version of the song, but...

2367
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:02,200
But we'll do our best.

2368
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:02,860
But we'll do our best.

2369
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:06,740
Tochu, yeah.

2370
03:20:06,820 --> 03:20:07,580
Tabi no Tochu.

2371
03:20:07,680 --> 03:20:08,920
Oh, this is from Spice and Wolf.

2372
03:20:09,400 --> 03:20:10,380
Tabi no Tochu.

2373
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:11,780
I

2374
03:20:50,980 --> 03:21:06,200
wandered alone in my heart I stood up But now I can walk far away But I can walk and walk away Tetsu.

2375
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:58,100
Now we've met in the distance We can be tee at it I've met you When all the thirsty fans sing That never-ending song A song you sing so punishingly A little pause... and we are back.

2376
03:22:24,100 --> 03:22:42,400
A little pause... and we are back.

2377
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:54,500
A little pause... and we are back.

2378
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:58,920
I'm stopping because I don't know how to read!

2379
03:22:59,180 --> 03:23:02,740
A little pause... and we are back.

2380
03:23:03,100 --> 03:23:06,400
A little pause... and we are back.

2381
03:23:06,400 --> 03:23:11,420
A little pause... and we are back.

2382
03:23:27,560 --> 03:23:28,800
I don't remember that part.

2383
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:57,620
A little pause...

2384
03:23:57,620 --> 03:23:57,620
and we are back.

2385
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:04,020
A little pause... and we are back.

2386
03:25:09,700 --> 03:25:10,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2387
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:12,180
Okie-dokie.

2388
03:25:12,780 --> 03:25:14,060
Guys, we're coming up.

2389
03:25:15,280 --> 03:25:16,640
I should probably... okay.

2390
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:22,860
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2391
03:25:25,060 --> 03:25:26,440
Okay, I can do 8 more songs.

2392
03:25:26,640 --> 03:25:27,520
I'm gonna power through them.

2393
03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:29,500
I'm getting kind of tired, so...

2394
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:33,560
I'm getting kind of tired, so...

2395
03:25:37,020 --> 03:25:37,780
Maybe... wait.

2396
03:25:37,780 --> 03:25:38,660
Did I count that one?

2397
03:25:38,740 --> 03:25:39,140
Maybe not.

2398
03:25:39,240 --> 03:25:39,680
Hold on.

2399
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:41,420
I wanna see if I know any Kodocha songs.

2400
03:25:41,660 --> 03:25:42,020
Someone...

2401
03:25:43,900 --> 03:25:45,280
This was a long time ago.

2402
03:25:45,320 --> 03:25:46,480
Someone asked Kodocha.

2403
03:25:47,720 --> 03:25:49,100
But I love Kodocha!

2404
03:25:49,360 --> 03:25:50,060
Oh my gosh.

2405
03:25:50,800 --> 03:25:52,320
Sana is so cute!

2406
03:25:53,280 --> 03:25:53,640
Kodocha.

2407
03:25:55,660 --> 03:25:56,020
Cha.

2408
03:25:56,900 --> 03:25:57,260
Cha.

2409
03:25:58,940 --> 03:25:59,300
Cha.

2410
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:01,700
Kodocha.

2411
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:04,240
I think my battery has been low for like the past hour.

2412
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:06,040
Oh wait, oh wait.

2413
03:26:06,200 --> 03:26:07,560
I have to put in Kodomo no Omocha.

2414
03:26:07,780 --> 03:26:08,200
Oh, that's what it is.

2415
03:26:09,340 --> 03:26:09,740
Kodomo.

2416
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:11,120
Sorry, I'm putting in the anime name.

2417
03:26:11,320 --> 03:26:12,820
So the anime is Kodomo.

2418
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:14,080
Kodomo.

2419
03:26:16,660 --> 03:26:18,600
But Kodocha is like the short name, you know.

2420
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:20,080
Kodomo no...

2421
03:26:21,420 --> 03:26:22,220
No, no...

2422
03:26:23,360 --> 03:26:23,760
Omocha...

2423
03:26:24,180 --> 03:26:24,580
O...

2424
03:26:24,580 --> 03:26:25,360
O...

2425
03:26:26,900 --> 03:26:27,300
Mo...

2426
03:26:27,300 --> 03:26:28,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:31,800
No Jikan.

2428
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:32,960
No!

2429
03:26:33,740 --> 03:26:34,540
Shut up!

2430
03:26:36,820 --> 03:26:38,300
You had me for like two seconds.

2431
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:40,420
Oh wait, ultra-relax?

2432
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:41,160
That was the one, right?

2433
03:26:50,160 --> 03:26:52,480
Oh my gosh, you literally just got me.

2434
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:53,540
I was like, oh, no jikan!

2435
03:26:53,640 --> 03:26:54,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2436
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:03,840
Okay, this might be the only song that I stopped mid-song today.

2437
03:27:05,960 --> 03:27:08,200
Because... I'm gonna see, I'm gonna see, I'm gonna see.

2438
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:10,060
Is this the one that's like...

2439
03:27:15,380 --> 03:27:18,700
Is that this one?

2440
03:28:09,390 --> 03:28:10,530
Okay, now let's listen.

2441
03:28:16,420 --> 03:28:16,860
Ah,

2442
03:28:24,400 --> 03:28:25,360
what is this music video?

2443
03:28:25,540 --> 03:28:25,960
Listen!

2444
03:28:36,820 --> 03:28:37,260
But

2445
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,620
I'm doing the dance at the same time from the Kodō-chan!

2446
03:29:10,730 --> 03:29:11,170
RILAX!

2447
03:29:14,790 --> 03:29:17,070
Why are the lyrics cutting off?

2448
03:29:21,290 --> 03:29:21,870
Delicious.

2449
03:29:21,870 --> 03:29:23,770
Why are the lyrics cutting off sometimes?

2450
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:32,470
What is going on?

2451
03:29:38,230 --> 03:29:39,990
You hear that bum bum?

2452
03:29:40,310 --> 03:29:41,490
That's the part that it cuts off.

2453
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:53,760
That's the part that it cuts off.

2454
03:30:06,940 --> 03:30:07,920
This

2455
03:30:11,010 --> 03:30:12,130
is so evil.

2456
03:30:12,570 --> 03:30:13,670
What is

2457
03:30:37,500 --> 03:30:38,900
happening?

2458
03:31:32,760 --> 03:31:33,780
Oba -san, pants!

2459
03:31:48,780 --> 03:31:50,220
Why are we talking about...

2460
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:52,860
Why are we talking about Oba-san's pants?

2461
03:31:55,380 --> 03:31:56,340
I did my best.

2462
03:31:56,980 --> 03:31:57,540
Oh, sorry.

2463
03:31:57,640 --> 03:31:58,240
I forgot to write.

2464
03:31:58,440 --> 03:31:58,860
You know what?

2465
03:31:58,900 --> 03:31:59,480
Maybe it's...

2466
03:31:59,480 --> 03:32:03,120
Actually, for anybody who was interested in the name of that song, it's called Ultra.

2467
03:32:04,800 --> 03:32:05,760
Ultra, relax.

2468
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:07,740
From Kodo-chan.

2469
03:32:08,300 --> 03:32:09,360
Kodomo na Oma-chan.

2470
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:11,340
I did my best there.

2471
03:32:13,800 --> 03:32:15,080
Hatsune Miku no Shoushitsu.

2472
03:32:15,140 --> 03:32:18,040
I'm like 99% positive it's on here.

2473
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:21,240
Now I'm gonna mess up another song.

2474
03:32:26,220 --> 03:32:28,760
I'm like paranoid now.

2475
03:32:28,800 --> 03:32:30,260
I feel like I need to pull up the...

2476
03:32:30,260 --> 03:32:31,640
My controller died!

2477
03:32:32,400 --> 03:32:32,780
Uh oh.

2478
03:32:32,940 --> 03:32:33,580
Hold on.

2479
03:32:33,580 --> 03:32:34,160
Okay.

2480
03:32:43,810 --> 03:32:45,070
The Joy-Con still works.

2481
03:32:45,110 --> 03:32:45,430
It's alright.

2482
03:32:45,630 --> 03:32:46,350
We're all good.

2483
03:32:46,430 --> 03:32:46,770
We're all good.

2484
03:32:51,160 --> 03:32:53,580
This song, I always... Like, I like this song.

2485
03:32:53,940 --> 03:32:55,940
I can never sing it well.

2486
03:32:56,440 --> 03:32:57,700
So I never sing it.

2487
03:33:08,320 --> 03:33:11,160
But I recently saw this song live at Anisama.

2488
03:33:12,740 --> 03:33:13,620
Wagamama Mirahar!

2489
03:33:19,430 --> 03:33:20,290
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2490
03:33:20,430 --> 03:33:20,870
Wait.

2491
03:33:22,490 --> 03:33:23,370
Wagamama Mirahar.

2492
03:33:23,370 --> 03:33:24,610
Well, you're right.

2493
03:33:30,240 --> 03:33:30,720
Yeah!

2494
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:31,540
Okay.

2495
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:33,060
I can never sing this song well.

2496
03:33:33,100 --> 03:33:34,240
I always get, like, parts of it wrong.

2497
03:33:34,540 --> 03:33:35,360
But you know what?

2498
03:33:35,660 --> 03:33:36,300
It's fine.

2499
03:33:39,320 --> 03:33:40,280
Wagamama Mirahar!

2500
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:44,020
Samasana hitomimou miteyo.

2501
03:33:45,980 --> 03:33:46,940
Too scary!

2502
03:34:07,540 --> 03:34:11,300
Ne, kirei na dake da tsuyogarenai.

2503
03:34:12,820 --> 03:34:15,000

2509
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:26,400
You're a sign.

2510
03:34:33,150 --> 03:34:34,680
Please don't.

2511
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:35,500
Please wait.

2512
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,720

Oh my gosh.

2531
03:35:18,500 --> 03:35:20,560
I have to, like, refuse my body.

2532
03:35:20,640 --> 03:35:21,360
It's from going...

2533
03:35:24,160 --> 03:35:24,580
Body!

2534
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:25,720
Stop!

2535

What is this?

2543
03:35:46,700 --> 03:35:49,100

2556
03:36:37,020 --> 03:36:37,940
I'm out of breath.

2557
03:36:39,340 --> 03:36:40,300
I'm out of breath.

2558
03:36:40,500 --> 03:36:41,220

2559
03:36:42,120 --> 03:36:42,920
Shinteru.

2560
03:36:42,940 --> 03:36:43,740
Shinteru.

2561
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:43,800
Shinteru.

2562
03:36:46,320 --> 03:36:46,720
Shinteru.

2563
03:36:46,720 --> 03:36:47,120
Yabeya!

2564
03:36:49,690 --> 03:36:51,100
Yowabushi mirror heart.

2565
03:36:51,420 --> 03:36:54,800
Itsudatte amonojaku.

2566
03:36:55,630 --> 03:36:59,600
Sunao ni warenai nande agenai.

2567
03:37:01,590 --> 03:37:03,160
Wagamama mirror heart.

2568
03:37:03,220 --> 03:37:06,720
Sakasama ni juujou yurete.

2569
03:37:07,490 --> 03:37:11,520
Kimi kara wa urahara ni utsuru no.

2570
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:13,700
Soredemo mirror heart.

2571
03:37:13,700 --> 03:37:17,520
Tate yori mo tsurugi na kodoron.

2572
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:20,740
Garasu zaiko yori sensai na no yo.

2573
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:22,220
Wakaru deshou.

2574
03:37:22,280 --> 03:37:23,400
Kizuite yo.

2575
03:37:24,260 --> 03:37:28,480
Dakara kyousei watashi wo maru hodo.

2576

Mitsumete hoshii no.

2577
03:37:31,540 --> 03:37:35,320
Watashi no dokoka wo oikanai de.

2578
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:41,520
Zemu yoyou na furi de wa atasete yo.

Tumete saiboi.

2581
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:04,620
Yay!

2582
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:08,040
My attempt at wagamama mirror heart.

2583
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:10,220
Holy moly.

2584
03:38:10,730 --> 03:38:11,900
You made it, somehow.

2585
03:38:12,280 --> 03:38:13,900
I'm fumbling my way through these songs.

2586
03:38:15,240 --> 03:38:17,080
Fumbling my way, I'm fumbling my way.

2587
03:38:21,260 --> 03:38:22,780
Fumble fumble fumble.

2588
03:38:28,940 --> 03:38:29,840
The next song?

2589
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:32,240
I think many people probably know it.

2590
03:38:33,520 --> 03:38:34,180
Oh, oops.

2591
03:38:44,030 --> 03:38:46,030
Like I know it, but do I know it to sing it?

2592
03:38:46,810 --> 03:38:47,210
Whatever.

2593
03:38:50,010 --> 03:38:51,490
It's been a while since I heard that song.

2594
03:38:51,590 --> 03:38:55,150
If you go to Anikura, you'll hear wagamama mirror heart all the time.

2595
03:38:55,410 --> 03:38:57,930
You will hear it all the time.

2596
03:38:58,410 --> 03:39:00,670
But it's been so long since I've been to Anikura.

2597
03:39:01,630 --> 03:39:03,230
I forget some of the calls sometimes.

2598
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:17,150
Fumbling down.

2599
03:39:17,150 --> 03:39:18,050
Fumbling down.

2600
03:39:23,260 --> 03:39:25,780
'' mythology around music '' '' ''

2601
03:39:31,060 --> 03:39:34,520
Rosie '' '' I I ''

2602
03:39:57,600 --> 03:40:04,500
A little pause...

2603
03:40:04,500 --> 03:40:04,500
and we are back.

2604
03:40:04,520 --> 03:40:34,480
A little pause... and we are back.

2605
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:53,200
Yes, this is a true otaku song.

2606
03:40:53,220 --> 03:40:53,980
Yes,

2607
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:07,600
this is a true otaku song.

2608
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:09,620
Colors might flow.

2609
03:41:12,780 --> 03:41:18,440
My otaku heart is flowing with otaku energy.

2610
03:42:45,230 --> 03:42:45,750
My otaku heart is flowing with otaku energy.

2611
03:42:45,750 --> 03:42:46,010
Super chat!

2612
03:42:46,830 --> 03:42:48,510
You distracted me from the outro!

2613
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:54,440
I was too bewildered.

2614
03:42:58,280 --> 03:42:58,800
Yay!

2615
03:42:58,800 --> 03:43:01,900
I just wanted to sing some kind of song like that.

2616
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:03,180
I feel like everybody knows...

2617
03:43:03,180 --> 03:43:07,500
Everybody knows Jibiru-mo se kai saimou.

2618
03:43:08,440 --> 03:43:10,740
I'm going to focus now on songs.

2619
03:43:10,960 --> 03:43:14,120
I would sing Chinese days, but I feel like I sing it very often.

2620
03:43:14,160 --> 03:43:14,480
I would sing Chinese days, but I feel like I sing it very often.

2621
03:43:14,500 --> 03:43:17,640
I'm going to kind of focus on songs that I don't sing very often, so...

2622
03:43:17,640 --> 03:43:19,560
I'm sorry if you asked for a song...

2623
03:43:20,540 --> 03:43:22,160
and I didn't sing it.

2624
03:43:24,760 --> 03:43:26,400
But I kind of want to sing this one too.

2625
03:43:27,300 --> 03:43:28,400
I think they have it.

2626
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:29,960
It's the first one.

2627
03:43:34,220 --> 03:43:35,660
I hope you guys don't mind.

2628
03:43:36,980 --> 03:43:38,100
Let's sing some...

2629
03:43:39,460 --> 03:43:39,860
some...

2630
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:41,120
key songs.

2631
03:43:41,380 --> 03:43:42,540
Key song, I guess.

2632
03:43:42,600 --> 03:43:43,640
This is the only one I have really.

2633
03:43:45,500 --> 03:43:45,940
Oh!

2634
03:43:53,100 --> 03:43:53,880
I'm so wrong!

2635
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:54,700
Holy shit!

2636
03:43:54,840 --> 03:43:55,060
Wait!

2637
03:43:57,360 --> 03:43:58,300
I'm so stupid.

2638
03:43:58,500 --> 03:43:58,840
Sorry.

2639
03:43:59,900 --> 03:44:01,320
I can't read ever.

2640
03:44:08,300 --> 03:44:09,560
Why did you guys stop me?

2641
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:26,660
Is it not on here?

2642
03:44:29,340 --> 03:44:30,600
I don't think it's on here!

2643
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:35,780
Yeah, the one by Lia!

2644
03:44:36,640 --> 03:44:37,920
I didn't even think about it.

2645
03:44:37,980 --> 03:44:38,420
I just...

2646
03:44:38,420 --> 03:44:38,860
I just...

2647
03:44:38,860 --> 03:44:39,480
Oh my gosh!

2648
03:44:39,680 --> 03:44:39,880
Yeah!

2649
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:41,300
Because I was like, the kanji...

2650
03:44:41,300 --> 03:44:42,900
The kanji is correct though, right?

2651
03:44:45,460 --> 03:44:46,360
Oh my gosh!

2652
03:44:46,380 --> 03:44:47,680
They don't even have it!

2653
03:44:48,720 --> 03:44:49,160
Noooo!

2654
03:44:53,080 --> 03:44:53,520
Natsukage!

2655
03:44:54,300 --> 03:44:55,320
Still technically something.

2656
03:44:55,960 --> 03:44:58,560
Actually, I think I remember that about a lot of...

2657
03:45:00,540 --> 03:45:01,420
A lot...

2658
03:45:01,420 --> 03:45:02,920
A lot of...

2659
03:45:04,620 --> 03:45:06,200
Key songs are not on here.

2660
03:45:10,500 --> 03:45:11,120
Let's see that.

2661
03:45:13,740 --> 03:45:14,980
Yeah, oh yeah...

2662
03:45:24,860 --> 03:45:26,640
Yeah, the key songs are not in Joy Sound.

2663
03:45:27,300 --> 03:45:27,720
Yeah...

2664
03:45:27,720 --> 03:45:29,120
I think I remember that now.

2665
03:45:29,400 --> 03:45:29,820
No...

2666
03:45:33,360 --> 03:45:35,280
I'm more sorry for you not knowing Girls and Panzer.

2667
03:45:35,280 --> 03:45:35,640
No, no!

2668
03:45:35,740 --> 03:45:36,840
I know Girls and Panzer!

2669
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:39,100
I know Girls and Panzer, of course.

2670
03:45:40,400 --> 03:45:41,660
I just don't know songs.

2671
03:45:42,080 --> 03:45:42,500
Hahaha!

2672
03:45:43,560 --> 03:45:43,980
I know...

2673
03:45:45,320 --> 03:45:45,820
Nanana...

2674
03:45:50,860 --> 03:45:52,360
Love Natsukage no...

2675
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:53,620
Nanana...

2676
03:45:53,620 --> 03:45:54,560
Nanana...

2677
03:45:55,660 --> 03:45:56,160
Dang.

2678
03:45:56,360 --> 03:45:56,660
Okay.

2679
03:45:56,780 --> 03:45:57,880
Well, that's alright.

2680
03:45:59,680 --> 03:46:00,340
It's okay.

2681
03:46:00,800 --> 03:46:01,460
That's okay.

2682
03:46:02,480 --> 03:46:04,060
We'll do the complete opposite vibe.

2683
03:46:05,940 --> 03:46:08,740
Oh wait, I sing this song pretty often I feel like too, but...

2684
03:46:09,640 --> 03:46:10,280
It's okay.

2685
03:46:11,560 --> 03:46:12,440
It's a classic.

2686
03:46:24,170 --> 03:46:24,770
Eternal Snow?

2687
03:46:25,150 --> 03:46:26,030
No, Eternal Blaze!

2688
03:46:26,790 --> 03:46:28,150
And then we can maybe do Eternal Snow.

2689
03:46:28,230 --> 03:46:29,950
I do still have Full Moon on the list, don't worry.

2690
03:46:30,710 --> 03:46:31,830
I do still have it.

2691
03:46:46,920 --> 03:46:47,260
Okay.

2692
03:48:35,430 --> 03:48:38,710
I have a surprise we're still getting new videos, my goodness!

2693
03:48:39,530 --> 03:48:41,370
Look at this fashion queen!

2694

A little pause...

2703
03:50:53,200 --> 03:50:53,200
and we are back.

2704
03:51:08,760 --> 03:51:23,180
A little pause... and we are back.

2705
03:51:58,080 --> 03:51:59,560
I'm out of... oh, I'm not out of water.

2706
03:52:02,200 --> 03:52:03,640
But I'm out of space in my bladder.

2707
03:52:06,060 --> 03:52:08,040
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.

2708
03:52:08,620 --> 03:52:09,600
Fudamon...

2709
03:52:10,620 --> 03:52:12,820
Fudamon, Fudamon, Fudamon...

2710
03:52:12,820 --> 03:52:14,760
Fufufahifu...

2711
03:52:14,760 --> 03:52:15,420
Fuu...

2712
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:16,620
Lu...

2713
03:52:18,620 --> 03:52:19,240
Mu...

2714
03:52:23,400 --> 03:52:24,240
Oh?

2715
03:52:26,700 --> 03:52:27,860
I'm searching...

2716
03:52:29,220 --> 03:52:34,240
Love Chronicle, Eternal Smile, New Future...

2717
03:52:34,780 --> 03:52:36,300
Which one did I sing before?

2718
03:52:37,720 --> 03:52:41,840
What did I say?

2719
03:52:42,120 --> 03:52:43,140
What did I say?

2720
03:52:45,100 --> 03:52:45,380
What song?

2721
03:52:45,540 --> 03:52:47,600
I... I think I sung Eternal Snow before.

2722
03:52:47,900 --> 03:52:49,560
Did I sing Love Chronicle before?

2723
03:52:51,880 --> 03:52:52,560
I wonder why?

2724
03:52:58,700 --> 03:53:00,820
Angel Beats is not on here, unfortunately.

2725
03:53:01,220 --> 03:53:01,700
I'm sorry.

2726
03:53:04,700 --> 03:53:05,640
What's Myself?

2727
03:53:05,720 --> 03:53:06,180
Oh, wait, no.

2728
03:53:08,140 --> 03:53:09,460
Return to Myself?

2729
03:53:10,400 --> 03:53:10,900
Myself?

2730
03:53:11,000 --> 03:53:11,400
This one?

2731
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:19,100
Myself?

2732
03:53:19,140 --> 03:53:19,140
This one?

2733
03:53:20,300 --> 03:53:21,640
Wait, how does this one go?

2734
03:53:22,580 --> 03:53:24,500
Why do I like you so much?

2735
03:53:26,120 --> 03:53:26,520
No?

2736
03:53:26,740 --> 03:53:27,100
Oh?

2737
03:53:35,480 --> 03:53:36,280
Inner Universe?

2738
03:53:36,460 --> 03:53:36,820
Oh my gosh.

2739
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:41,120
I've tried to get Matara to sing Inner Universe.

2740
03:53:41,800 --> 03:53:42,580
It's in Russian.

2741
03:53:44,560 --> 03:53:46,080
Hold on, I just want to hear how this one goes.

2742
03:53:46,380 --> 03:53:48,120
I know most of them, I think.

2743
03:53:52,320 --> 03:53:53,720
How do he character songs?

2744
03:53:53,960 --> 03:53:55,360
Oh my gosh, I want to sing the Yukio one.

2745
03:53:58,140 --> 03:53:58,620
Myself.

2746
03:54:02,880 --> 03:54:03,640
Alright, Ronaldo.

2747
03:54:04,780 --> 03:54:05,600
Get out of here.

2748
03:54:08,980 --> 03:54:09,680
Yeah, yeah.

2749
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:16,220
Why, why do I like you so much?

2750
03:54:16,400 --> 03:54:20,340
My tears are overflowing.

2751
03:54:26,360 --> 03:54:26,980
My tears are overflowing.

2752
03:54:26,980 --> 03:54:27,560
I'll do this one.

2753
03:54:27,680 --> 03:54:30,220
I think I know it enough, probably.

2754
03:54:39,390 --> 03:54:41,210
Oh, we start with the sad girl.

2755
03:54:41,390 --> 03:54:42,270
I don't know.

2756
03:54:44,130 --> 03:54:52,820
At that time, there were too many things to lose.

2757
03:54:54,040 --> 03:54:56,300
I couldn't sing anything.

2758
03:54:56,300 --> 03:54:57,240
I didn't know where I was.

2759
03:54:58,220 --> 03:55:01,820
A little distant place.

2760
03:55:02,880 --> 03:55:08,480
That was where I should be.

2761
03:55:10,380 --> 03:55:15,840
Deep inside your eyes, that day...

2762
03:55:15,840 --> 03:55:16,840
I haven't seen you.

2763
03:55:16,840 --> 03:55:18,200
I found the sadness.

2764
03:55:22,300 --> 03:55:24,820
We weren't the same.

2765
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:54,800
A little pause...

2766
03:55:54,800 --> 03:55:54,800
and we are back.

2767
03:55:58,040 --> 03:56:00,840
A little

2768
03:56:19,220 --> 03:56:36,400
pause...

2769
03:56:38,060 --> 03:56:44,600
and we are back.

2770
03:57:04,300 --> 03:57:14,820
A little pause... and we are back.

2771
03:57:14,860 --> 03:57:34,520
A little pause... and we are back.

2772
03:57:40,180 --> 03:57:41,300
Soja, thank you!

2773
03:57:41,400 --> 03:57:42,380
Welcome to membership, too!

2774
03:57:43,720 --> 03:57:44,600
Soja, thank you!

2775
03:57:44,600 --> 03:57:44,600
Welcome to membership, too!

2776
03:57:44,600 --> 03:57:45,300
Soja, thank you!

2777
03:57:46,400 --> 03:57:46,400
Welcome to membership, too!

2778
03:58:07,100 --> 03:58:08,500
Soja,

2779
03:58:13,700 --> 03:58:15,240
thank you!

2780
03:58:19,400 --> 03:58:21,580
Welcome to membership, too!

2781
03:58:21,600 --> 03:58:22,100
Welcome to membership, too!

2782
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:25,560
Sorry,

2783
03:58:31,250 --> 03:58:31,950
I couldn't remember that.

2784
03:58:34,310 --> 03:58:36,510
This little kid and his harmonica!

2785
03:58:44,380 --> 03:58:46,000
Oh look, he's got his beat on!

2786
03:58:49,460 --> 03:58:51,040
Yay, that was Full Moon.

2787
03:58:51,320 --> 03:58:51,660
Find Full Moon!

2788
03:58:52,560 --> 03:58:53,100
Find Full Moon.

2789
03:58:56,820 --> 03:58:58,920
Now, I know people want me to sing...

2790
03:58:58,920 --> 03:59:00,080
You get the burning!

2791
03:59:02,500 --> 03:59:03,540
From Nadesco.

2792
03:59:03,800 --> 03:59:05,360
But I think I'm gonna sing another song.

2793
03:59:05,380 --> 03:59:05,880
But that's okay.

2794
03:59:07,680 --> 03:59:08,540
If that's okay.

2795
03:59:09,380 --> 03:59:10,580
It's one of my favorite songs.

2796
03:59:12,700 --> 03:59:13,220
From...

2797
03:59:14,060 --> 03:59:14,580
Nadesco!

2798
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:17,000
...

2799
03:59:19,020 --> 03:59:19,540
...

2800
03:59:19,540 --> 03:59:20,300
...

2801
03:59:25,080 --> 03:59:25,600
...

2802
03:59:25,600 --> 03:59:26,000
...

2803
03:59:26,600 --> 03:59:28,840
I know this is gonna bring up a ton of results, but...

2804
03:59:29,900 --> 03:59:30,960
It should be fine.

2805
03:59:33,400 --> 03:59:34,580
You get the burning!

2806
03:59:34,840 --> 03:59:36,340
How does it start again?

2807
03:59:40,220 --> 03:59:40,920
That's the issue.

2808
03:59:41,140 --> 03:59:43,800
I feel like I will remember the...

2809
03:59:45,900 --> 03:59:46,340
The...

2810
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:49,640
Just the chorus the best.

2811
03:59:49,820 --> 03:59:50,040
You know?

2812
03:59:56,750 --> 03:59:58,350
So I'm gonna sing a song from...

2813
03:59:58,350 --> 03:59:58,530
From...

2814
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:00,850
From Nadesco.

2815
04:00:01,770 --> 04:00:02,210
Instead.

2816
04:00:02,590 --> 04:00:04,470
Sung by my favorite character, Ruri.

2817
04:00:06,750 --> 04:00:08,870
Called Anata no Ichiban ni Naritai!

2818
04:00:10,450 --> 04:00:12,150
I forget everything except the chorus that time.

2819
04:00:12,190 --> 04:00:13,010
I love the beginning though.

2820
04:00:15,730 --> 04:00:17,350
I will sing it one day.

2821
04:00:18,190 --> 04:00:20,290
You get the burning will come eventually.

2822
04:00:20,550 --> 04:00:21,170
Don't worry.

2823
04:00:21,270 --> 04:00:22,110
One day it will happen.

2824
04:00:30,070 --> 04:00:32,510
Let's get a cuter song right now.

2825
04:00:34,770 --> 04:00:35,290
Nadesco?

2826
04:00:35,430 --> 04:00:35,870
Yes!

2827
04:00:59,770 --> 04:01:03,450
Nadesco by Nadesco Yeah, the talent show!

2828
04:01:17,030 --> 04:01:18,510
Let's go!

2829
04:01:19,330 --> 04:01:19,770
Let's go!

2830
04:01:23,870 --> 04:01:24,630
Let's go!

2831
04:01:26,890 --> 04:01:32,310
Oh my god a background!

2832
04:01:32,450 --> 04:01:33,750
That suits the actual theme!

2833
04:01:34,230 --> 04:01:34,770
Oh my gosh!

2834
04:02:31,420 --> 04:02:33,320
This song is so sweet!

2835
04:02:36,380 --> 04:02:37,860
This song

2836
04:02:42,010 --> 04:02:43,550
is so sweet!

2837
04:03:06,810 --> 04:03:08,950
Oh my gosh, they're flirting!

2838
04:03:09,390 --> 04:03:09,850
Hahaha!

2839
04:03:38,690 --> 04:03:39,770
Ships and love!

2840
04:03:40,590 --> 04:03:41,910
Ships and love!

2841
04:03:43,670 --> 04:03:45,010
Ships and love!

2842
04:04:02,530 --> 04:04:02,970
Hahaha!

2843
04:04:24,830 --> 04:04:27,830
I still have a couple more songs that I want to sing.

2844
04:04:28,210 --> 04:04:29,430
What should we end the

2845
04:04:34,060 --> 04:04:34,660
party song?

2846
04:04:45,830 --> 04:04:46,710
What should we end the party song?

2847
04:04:58,570 --> 04:05:00,690
I still have a couple more songs that I want to sing.

2848
04:05:00,990 --> 04:05:06,830
I still have a couple more songs that I want to sing.

2849
04:05:06,870 --> 04:05:11,210
It's sky blue.

2850
04:05:11,790 --> 04:05:13,150
Maybe I could try.

2851
04:05:17,410 --> 04:05:17,850
Again.

2852
04:05:20,250 --> 04:05:21,050
Ah, sheep Burcha.

2853
04:05:21,450 --> 04:05:21,890
Again.

2854
04:05:23,810 --> 04:05:25,630
Ah, sheep Burcha.

2855
04:05:25,630 --> 04:05:28,390
Ah, sheep

2856
04:05:32,640 --> 04:05:37,200
Burcha.

2857
04:05:38,240 --> 04:05:42,320
I know what song I want to end on.

2858
04:05:43,160 --> 04:05:46,880
I don't think I've ever sung it before but I love this song.

2859
04:05:48,500 --> 04:05:48,940
Sorry.

2860
04:05:49,880 --> 04:05:51,380
Lots of good suggestions though.

2861
04:05:52,180 --> 04:05:52,620
Lots of good suggestions though.

2862
04:05:56,210 --> 04:06:00,450
Like I said though, I still have a few more songs, like, I'm gonna try and find this one.

2863
04:06:05,030 --> 04:06:09,530
Even though it's Friday the 13th, I haven't done a single spooky song.

2864
04:06:10,550 --> 04:06:12,790
I don't know really what a spooky song would be though, right?

2865
04:06:14,530 --> 04:06:15,370
I don't know.

2866
04:06:18,170 --> 04:06:19,590
But, I want to try this one.

2867
04:06:21,830 --> 04:06:25,730
I'll be honest though, I am all in on Fall right now.

2868
04:06:25,730 --> 04:06:31,210
I'm like, I know there's still a few more days left of Summer, but I'm like so all in on Fall.

2869
04:06:33,590 --> 04:06:35,830
Okay, what I'm going to do...

2870
04:06:37,550 --> 04:06:40,730
Because, actually, I'll do the song and then I'll...

2871
04:06:42,510 --> 04:06:42,950
No.

2872
04:06:44,370 --> 04:06:46,050
Have you ever watched Nadesco Printed Darts?

2873
04:06:46,090 --> 04:06:46,450
I have!

2874
04:06:46,650 --> 04:06:47,490
I have, I have, yeah.

2875
04:06:48,650 --> 04:06:52,510
I own, like, the Dreamcast Nadesco games.

2876
04:06:53,350 --> 04:06:55,710
The stuff that takes place in between the Nadesco games.

2877
04:06:55,730 --> 04:06:58,270
The Nadesco series, and then the Nadesco movie, you know?

2878
04:06:58,370 --> 04:07:02,010
Like, I'm a huge fan of Nadesco.

2879
04:07:03,350 --> 04:07:04,350
Have I played them?

2880
04:07:04,490 --> 04:07:04,870
No.

2881
04:07:05,490 --> 04:07:06,210
Higurashi is spooky.

2882
04:07:06,890 --> 04:07:08,430
You are so right!

2883
04:07:08,890 --> 04:07:09,790
Oh my gosh.

2884
04:07:11,570 --> 04:07:12,570
Okay, alright.

2885
04:07:14,130 --> 04:07:15,870
Oh, no, not hiki.

2886
04:07:23,000 --> 04:07:25,360
No, not kokorani.

2887
04:07:26,400 --> 04:07:26,960
Wait.

2888
04:07:28,440 --> 04:07:29,220
I don't want to look up higurashi.

2889
04:07:30,260 --> 04:07:30,660
No.

2890
04:07:31,060 --> 04:07:36,340
I don't want to look up, like, kai, or, you know, getsu, or sotsu, or whatever.

2891
04:07:37,940 --> 04:07:38,340
Okay,

2892
04:07:41,680 --> 04:07:42,340
I'm just going to search this.

2893
04:07:47,340 --> 04:07:48,920
Which higurashi song do I sing?

2894
04:07:49,040 --> 04:07:49,960
Higurashi no nakokorani.

2895
04:07:50,100 --> 04:07:50,780
Do I sing...

2896
04:07:50,780 --> 04:07:52,900
I believe in what you...

2897
04:07:53,480 --> 04:07:53,680
Analogy?

2898
04:07:56,460 --> 04:07:57,600
No, not the medley.

2899
04:07:58,960 --> 04:08:00,420
Usually these medleys kind of suck.

2900
04:08:00,460 --> 04:08:01,120
They're not so fun.

2901
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:04,460
Dear You?

2902
04:08:06,660 --> 04:08:08,000
You know what that could replace?

2903
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:10,580
I was going to sing Natsukage, but Dear You could replace...

2904
04:08:13,780 --> 04:08:17,120
Could replace it, because it's very... that kind of vibe, right?

2905
04:08:17,560 --> 04:08:18,940
They don't have it?

2906
04:08:19,000 --> 04:08:20,640
No way!

2907
04:08:21,560 --> 04:08:22,520
I'm going to cry.

2908
04:08:25,840 --> 04:08:26,360
No!

2909
04:08:29,380 --> 04:08:30,560
But it's like...

2910
04:08:30,560 --> 04:08:31,520
It's...

2911
04:08:31,520 --> 04:08:32,040
It's...

2912
04:08:32,040 --> 04:08:32,100
It's...

2913
04:08:32,100 --> 04:08:32,500
It's...

2914
04:08:32,500 --> 04:08:37,260
I mean, which variation even would we sing, but it's still...

2915
04:08:37,260 --> 04:08:39,020
Kami-sama no shin syndrome?

2916
04:08:41,040 --> 04:08:41,920
I'm going to cry.

2917
04:08:43,440 --> 04:08:44,140
Naraku no Hana.

2918
04:08:44,460 --> 04:08:44,980
You know what?

2919
04:08:45,000 --> 04:08:45,400
I'll just go.

2920
04:08:45,580 --> 04:08:45,900
Let's see.

2921
04:08:45,980 --> 04:08:49,480
Since I said I wanted kind of a spooky song, let's go with Higurashi no nakokorani.

2922
04:08:49,740 --> 04:08:50,100
Right?

2923
04:08:50,340 --> 04:08:51,120
It's kind of spooky.

2924
04:08:51,240 --> 04:08:51,980
It's like the spookiest.

2925
04:08:52,340 --> 04:08:53,160
It's pretty spooky.

2926
04:08:54,740 --> 04:08:55,440
It's pretty...

2927
04:08:55,440 --> 04:08:56,500
It's pretty spooky, right?

2928
04:09:00,370 --> 04:09:00,850
Oh, wait.

2929
04:09:00,930 --> 04:09:01,070
Oh.

2930
04:09:01,070 --> 04:09:02,010
Let me type it down.

2931
04:09:14,100 --> 04:09:14,620
Whoa!

2932
04:09:22,300 --> 04:09:22,820
The moon!

2933
04:09:24,160 --> 04:09:24,680
The

2934
04:09:39,680 --> 04:09:40,040
13!

2935
04:09:41,160 --> 04:09:41,920
The 13!

2936
04:09:41,920 --> 04:09:41,980
The 13!

2937
04:09:42,040 --> 04:09:42,780
The 13!

2938
04:09:42,780 --> 04:09:43,000
The 13!

2939
04:09:43,000 --> 04:09:43,200
The 13!

2940
04:09:43,460 --> 04:09:45,180
The 13!

2941
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:49,080
The 13!

2942
04:10:04,960 --> 04:10:05,760
The moon!

2943
04:10:11,560 --> 04:10:12,360
The moon!

2944
04:10:13,360 --> 04:10:14,000
It's easy to read!

2945
04:10:14,000 --> 04:10:14,040
How do we say this?

2946
04:10:14,040 --> 04:10:14,760
Have a nice day!

2947
04:10:14,760 --> 04:10:16,200
Have a nice day!

2948
04:10:16,340 --> 04:10:16,740
Bye!

2949
04:10:17,040 --> 04:10:17,100
Bye!

2950
04:10:17,280 --> 04:10:17,340
Bye!

2951
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:45,120
We were just in the city, what happened?

2952
04:11:29,440 --> 04:11:34,100
We were just in the city, what happened?

2953
04:12:00,720 --> 04:12:01,440
What

2954
04:12:13,360 --> 04:12:15,400
is happening in this video?

2955
04:12:15,520 --> 04:12:16,020
I don't know.

2956
04:13:12,660 --> 04:13:16,920
Oh, my gosh, you guys, my neck is starting to, like, itch, like, crazy!

2957
04:13:18,940 --> 04:13:19,400
Weird!

2958
04:13:21,620 --> 04:13:24,340
I'm just going to keep itching it, I'm just going to keep scratching!

2959
04:13:26,500 --> 04:13:29,920
It's, like, really itchy!

2960
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:31,680
Oh, my gosh, it's, like, really, really itchy!

2961
04:13:31,860 --> 04:13:33,760
Oh, my gosh, it's, like, crazy itchy!

2962
04:13:33,980 --> 04:13:34,300
Wow!

2963
04:13:35,000 --> 04:13:37,040
Wow, oh, my gosh, my neck has never been so itchy before.

2964
04:13:40,520 --> 04:13:41,480
Not the itch.

2965
04:13:46,620 --> 04:13:48,140
Do you know Oyashiro-sama?

2966
04:13:48,580 --> 04:13:49,480
Yes, I know!

2967
04:13:51,200 --> 04:13:51,520
Yeah,

2968
04:13:55,080 --> 04:13:55,880
I should drink more water.

2969
04:13:55,940 --> 04:13:56,180
Yeah, I should drink more water.

2970
04:13:56,200 --> 04:13:58,240
More of the water from the village, right?

2971
04:14:00,520 --> 04:14:01,300
Is this a bit?

2972
04:14:01,360 --> 04:14:01,720
Are you okay?

2973
04:14:01,860 --> 04:14:02,820
Oh, I guess...

2974
04:14:02,820 --> 04:14:08,760
For people that don't know, when you get Hinamizawa syndrome, your neck starts to, like, itch a lot.

2975
04:14:08,900 --> 04:14:12,960
And it's from the anime that I just sang, Higurashi no Nakakoro ni.

2976
04:14:15,640 --> 04:14:18,700
So, you know, it's, like, one of those, you know...

2977
04:14:18,700 --> 04:14:19,380
Yeah, the maggots!

2978
04:14:19,420 --> 04:14:20,220
Yeah, the maggots!

2979
04:14:20,460 --> 04:14:22,420
The maggots!

2980
04:14:22,420 --> 04:14:22,520
The maggots!

2981
04:14:26,230 --> 04:14:26,650
Alrighty!

2982
04:14:27,890 --> 04:14:29,750
Oh, my gosh, it's been four hours, me singing.

2983
04:14:30,190 --> 04:14:31,790
I did not expect to sing this long.

2984
04:14:32,350 --> 04:14:32,770
Truly.

2985
04:14:33,450 --> 04:14:35,550
But I have one last song I would like to sing.

2986
04:14:37,010 --> 04:14:38,010
One last song.

2987
04:14:39,310 --> 04:14:40,410
A song that...

2988
04:14:41,110 --> 04:14:42,410
Probably I don't sing very well.

2989
04:14:43,030 --> 04:14:45,450
But I love singing it because it's so fun.

2990
04:14:46,570 --> 04:14:50,850
And I want everybody to sing along if you know it.

2991
04:14:57,630 --> 04:14:58,050
What?

2992
04:14:59,310 --> 04:14:59,730
What?

2993
04:14:59,870 --> 04:14:59,990
What is...

2994
04:14:59,990 --> 04:15:00,190
Which...

2995
04:15:00,970 --> 04:15:01,390
Actually...

2996
04:15:07,550 --> 04:15:08,230
Oh, gosh.

2997
04:15:09,370 --> 04:15:10,010
It's, like...

2998
04:15:10,010 --> 04:15:10,750
There's, like, a bajillion.

2999
04:15:10,970 --> 04:15:11,190
Oh.

3000
04:15:15,610 --> 04:15:16,450
Hold on.

3001
04:15:17,410 --> 04:15:18,130
Who's the artist?

3002
04:15:33,240 --> 04:15:33,660
Oh!

3003
04:15:33,840 --> 04:15:34,960
Should I put it in Japanese?

3004
04:15:35,220 --> 04:15:35,640
Okay.

3005
04:15:35,980 --> 04:15:36,400
Thanks.

3006
04:15:36,400 --> 04:15:36,500
Thanks.

3007
04:15:36,560 --> 04:15:37,000
Thanks.

3008
04:15:37,300 --> 04:15:37,740
Thanks.

3009
04:15:38,680 --> 04:15:39,120
Thanks.

3010
04:15:39,120 --> 04:15:39,580
Yeah, you're right.

3011
04:15:47,480 --> 04:15:48,160
Yeah, Japanese?

3012
04:15:48,460 --> 04:15:48,640
Okay.

3013
04:15:52,860 --> 04:15:53,300
Thanks!

3014
04:15:53,920 --> 04:15:54,360
Yeah.

3015
04:15:54,460 --> 04:15:55,780
It'll probably be way easier, right?

3016
04:15:55,800 --> 04:15:56,820
Because there's so many English songs.

3017
04:15:57,440 --> 04:15:57,880
Yay!

3018
04:15:58,780 --> 04:15:59,380
Let's sing!

3019
04:15:59,460 --> 04:16:00,860
We are from One Piece!

3020
04:16:01,960 --> 04:16:02,400
Yippee!

3021
04:16:13,780 --> 04:16:14,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3022
04:16:16,120 --> 04:16:16,560

3024
04:16:23,640 --> 04:16:25,260

3028
04:17:17,550 --> 04:17:31,430

3029
04:17:46,740 --> 04:18:00,280
and we are back.

3030
04:18:11,200 --> 04:18:14,220
The song always gets me so high!

3031
04:18:52,840 --> 04:19:00,460
肩押されて一歩リードさ 今度会えたら話すつもりさ それからのことと これからのこと

3032
04:19:10,760 --> 04:19:38,080
誰かにアピールできるいいチャンス だって夜はポケットにはないけど ポケットにロマンス それとYou wanna be my friend We are, we are on the cruise.
