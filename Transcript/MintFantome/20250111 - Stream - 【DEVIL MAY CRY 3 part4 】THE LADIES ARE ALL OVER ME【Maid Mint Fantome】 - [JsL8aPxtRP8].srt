00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,810
Welcome back!

2
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,710
Hello!

3
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,790
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome in.

4
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,270
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

5
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,190
My cough is not good.

6
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,570
Not much better.

7
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,930
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

8
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,610
Thank you.

9
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,170
Thank you so much.

10
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,390
I'm still feeling a little under the weather today.

11
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,730
Today, my... how do I say?

12
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,750
My nose was filled with so much ectoplasm earlier.

13
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,170
So, we'll just kind of see how far I get.

14
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,990
I definitely didn't want to miss stream though.

15
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,890
Firebug, thank you for the 10 gifts.

16
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,850
Ducky, thank you for the 5 gifts.

17
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,590
Thank you guys.

18
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,250
Filled with light.

19
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,390
I really wanted to play more DMC though.

20
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,650
So I apologize if I'm a little... not stupid.

21
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,370
Ducky, thank you for the 5 gifts.

22
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,830
Thank you.

23
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,250
Baby coffee.

24
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,770
Baby coffee.

25
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,970
Smart coughs?

26
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,270
Maybe.

27
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,550
Maybe, yeah.

28
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,270
Welcome back, DMC3.

29
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,150
Hope you feel better.

30
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,790
Thank you.

31
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,490
Thanks for the 3 bonds, Blade.

32
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,390
Thank you.

33
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,290
Teacup.

34
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,390
You're back to Teacup and NyanNyan.

35
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,210
Thanks for the 5 gifts, dude.

36
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,710
Oh my gosh.

37
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,090
So many messages.

38
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,190
Mike, welcome back.

39
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,010
Thank you.

40
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,550
Zidem, welcome back.

41
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,390
Thank you.

42
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,870
Thank you for stream on birthday.

43
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:58,970
Please don't sing.

44
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,690
Happy birth...

45
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,810
Are you sure you don't want me to?

46
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,850
Are you sure?

47
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,730
No song?

48
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,930
Happy birthday!

49
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,170
Mero, welcome to membership.

50
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,310
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

51
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,210
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

52
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
Queue down screen.

53
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,190
Dante, of course.

54
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Dante is not here.

55
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,580
He's not here.

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,580
OK.

57
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,960
Let's get playing before I...

58
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
Before I... I don't know.

59
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,780
Ghosts don't die.

60
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,480
Before I reincarnate?

61
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,540
Is that possible?

62
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,140
Can I reincarnate from being sick?

63
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,740
I don't think so.

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,740
Shino, thank you for the 10 gifts.

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,540
Thank you so much.

66
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,760
Maybe I go into hibernation.

67
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't know.

68
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,100
Turn down the sound a little bit.

69
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,700
Sometimes the sound in this game is all over the place.

70
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,540
I remember the...

71
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,400
The voices being so low, but...

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
Sweet dreams.

73
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
But the music is so loud.

74
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,340
Let's watch the opening.

75
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,360
We did this.

76
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,560
We did this.

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:35,960
We did this.

78
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,420
We did this.

79
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,940
We were motivated.

80
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,780
We were motivated.

81
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,020
Thanks, Kari!

82
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,940
It's real.

83
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,120
So cold.

84
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,220
Oh my god.

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,260
Dante is back.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
RT Ronin, thanks for the 5 gifted.

87
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,340
True, true, true.

88
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,100
That's what I did.

89
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
That's exactly how the fight went.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,240
That looks exactly like what I did.

91
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
True story.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,140
True, true, true.

93
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,640
This is actually like recorded footage from my playthrough, you know?

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,780
Yeah, you remember?

95
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,640
But this...

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,360
But I got stabbed less.

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,080
I got stabbed...

98
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,340
That wasn't me though.

99
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,460
Only one was left standing.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Yeah, that part is exaggerated for a dramatic effect, you know?

101
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,320
Stop getting stabbed.

102
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,180
I did the stabbing.

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.

104
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah.

105
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,820
Could you slick back your hair too?

106
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't think I can do that.

107
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,280
I can make my bangs shorter.

108
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
I can make them longer.

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,120
Oh wait!

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,820
I can slick back my hair.

111
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,730
Maybe too much.

112
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,210
Too far?

113
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,210
I've been nominated for an Emmy for DMC cutscene performance.

114
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,230
Thank you.

115
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,210
Thank you.

116
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,410
Thank you.

117
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,150
It's Caillou?

118
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,990
What?

119
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,150
What?

120
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,550
That's so... What?

121
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,470
That's so offensive.

122
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,300
It's funny because like...

123
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,300
When Caillou was doing her magic...

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,060
She showed me originally my face moving and I was bald.

125
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,120
And I was like, you know, maybe I'll have a bald toggle.

126
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
I'll like never use it.

127
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,340
Like ever.

128
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,460
And now I've used it like three times.

129
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,080
I even used it in my debut.

130
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,340
I don't like to use it though.

131
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,580
I don't want you guys to think of me as bald.

132
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,360
I don't want you guys to have that perception of me.

133
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,960
I want you to think of me as like a...

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,660
As like a dog with hair.

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,020
ViviCore thanks you for the five gifted.

136
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,840
You know?

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Bald Minky extra cute.

138
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,200
No!

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm here to get beat up by a cute ghost maid with a foam sword handing out flyers.

140
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,660
Yeah, let's just...

141
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,840
If you guys have seen that video...

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,620
Let's conjure all the energy of all the stabbings as me stabbing people not taking my flyer from my maid cafe.

143
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,900
Think of you as a 2P.

144
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,800
A 2P.

145
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,860
2P or not 2P.

146
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,980
I'll think of you as a cute instead.

147
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,040
No!

148
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,160
You're still cute when bald though.

149
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,100
No!

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,740
But I mean bald is beautiful.

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,740
I say that.

152
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,460
So all the people who are bald in chat don't feel bad.

153
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm just like you.

154
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
But with hair instead of bald.

155
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,660
But I can be bald.

156
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,020
Sometimes.

157
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,900
Aren't we all born bald?

158
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,260
I might have died bald.

159
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,120
And then grew my hair back.

160
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't know.

161
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,860
Animation service station!

162
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,220
Welcome to membership.

163
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,180
Thank you.

164
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,920
I have a full head of hair.

165
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,120
On most days.

166
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,540
Is the hair just ectoplasm?

167
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm all ectoplasm baby!

168
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,220
I've got only ectoplasm.

169
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,940
Except my hair.

170
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,220
Which is a wig.

171
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,420
But it's also attached to me.

172
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,820
It's real.

173
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,320
A real wig.

174
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,640
I'm bald.

175
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
But not also bald.

176
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,060
I have hair.

177
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,730
It's my birthday.

178
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,350
I'm turning less of a bald baby.

179
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,870
Can you sing me happy birthday while bald?

180
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,330
MsFist is it really your birthday?

181
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,950
Is it really your birthday?

182
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,690
And you're asking for...

183
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,210
No.

184
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,510
Is it really?

185
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,370
Are you pulling my leg?

186
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,910
Are you joshing me?

187
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,070
Are you making a donkey out of me?

188
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,230
Is it really?

189
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,890
I'm going to go to your Twitter.

190
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,370
And I'm going to see if there's balloons.

191
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,210
MsFist.

192
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,900
There's no balloons!

193
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,560
There's no balloons!

194
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,460
You lied!

195
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,830
Red handed!

196
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,700
I almost got caught.

197
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,460
I almost went bald for you!

198
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,320
Fact check.

199
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,240
MsFist, you're pretty quiet now.

200
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
Twitter doesn't show balloons anymore.

201
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,720
That's a lie!

202
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,880
Wait, does it really?

203
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,640
I'm googling that too.

204
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Oh wait.

205
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,220
I tweeted about you watching other Vtubers and you said it's your birthday.

206
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you put it in the wrong day?

207
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,340
What was that?

208
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Something just moved in my room.

209
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,760
Be gone!

210
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,580
Spirit!

211
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,680
That's not me!

212
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,000
My birthday was a few days ago.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh gosh.

214
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,220
Do you also want me to be bald Andrew?

215
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,620
Oh no.

216
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,400
Guys, I have to play the game.

217
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,860
Happy birthday to you!

218
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,760
Happy birthday to you!

219
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,690
To you!

220
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,790
Happy birthday bald MsFist!

221
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,030
No

222
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,340
more!

223
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,880
No more!

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,900
No more!

225
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,180
Rub her bald head for luck.

226
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Oh no!

227
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,220
You have to pay me rorbs to rub my head.

228
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,560
So I can then convert it to blorbs.

229
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,360
Vin Diesel!

230
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,340
I found the balloon.

231
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:04,980
No!

232
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,670
Rorbs, rorbs.

233
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,210
Ok, I have to remember how to play the game.

234
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,330
It's been even longer than usual since I last played.

235
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,710
Was it really Christmas Eve, Eve?

236
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,790
Bald head of the Minto, what is your wisdom?

237
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,020
A blorb a day keeps the demons at bay.

238
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
Nice morb of a Vtuber, thank you.

239
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,260
Weepking, welcome to membership, thank you.

240
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,580
Hi Minto, hope you're feeling better.

241
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,340
Thank you!

242
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

243
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,640
Minto DMC tradition, relearn the gameplay.

244
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,220
It's true.

245
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,120
It's true.

246
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,280
Why does he have that look on his face?

247
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,640
So we are on chapter 10.

248
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,500
Chapter 10 baby.

249
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,160
We watched this, but we'll watch it again.

250
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,940
He's judging me.

251
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm a little big.

252
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Hope you're resting well.

253
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,640
Don't push yourself too hard.

254
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,320
Thank you.

255
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,580
We have to see the number.

256
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Yell it out when you see it.

257
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,580
Yell number, number!

258
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Wait, we are looking for 10, right?

259
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,140
10 number?

260
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,620
It was on the...was it on the book?

261
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,960
Does that woman really bother you?

262
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,900
Seize wax.

263
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,660
10.

264
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh my god.

265
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,400
Knowing this, I thought you'd be more useful to me.

266
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
But I was wrong.

267
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,000
No wonder your attainment of power was incomplete.

268
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,220
He looks like a Ken doll.

269
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,500
His head is detachable.

270
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,120
You're an incomplete being as well.

271
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,940
Vergil's eyes are so...10!

272
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,820
Demon and human blood mingle in your veins.

273
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,720
His eyes are so big in anime.

274
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,680
That one feels a little more subtle.

275
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,480
I have no use for you.

276
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,310
The job.

277
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,710
The job.

278
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,690
Strengthen the silent bridge.

279
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,730
How much?

280
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,170
Let's see.

281
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,590
Let's check how much robes and everything I've got to purchase item.

282
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,310
26,000!

283
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,830
We could buy a blorb.

284
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,510
Wasn't I saving up for something?

285
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,510
I was saving up for...something.

286
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,990
And we just got Nevon.

287
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,830
Air raid.

288
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,190
It was probably Air Hike on Agni and Rudra.

289
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,570
I think it was.

290
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,270
Wait, but that's only 20,000.

291
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,670
What was I saving up for?

292
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,250
Vergil's such a weeb.

293
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,610
Did I get more stuff and I didn't realize?

294
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,470
More robes?

295
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,410
I think you got a lot at once.

296
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,650
Oh, whoops.

297
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,910
I have everything for this.

298
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,870
Is there anything I should buy for this new guy?

299
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,870
Is this new weapon pretty good?

300
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,470
Reverb shock.

301
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,970
Charge at the enemy and hit them with a powerful electric attack.

302
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,810
R, L, X.

303
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,330
No, but it's cool as fuck.

304
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,110
Air raid.

305
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,070
Air raid we had before.

306
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,030
In...I remember.

307
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,270
After transforming into demon form, you can spread out your ultra-powerful demon wings to float in the air for a limited time.

308
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,410
Press R, plus B, and midair.

309
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,670
Nevon is difficult to learn.

310
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,950
It's a tricky weapon.

311
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,410
It's very different from the other weapons.

312
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,170
Here, let's test it out then.

313
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,430
I just won't buy anything right now.

314
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,130
Oh, we're here.

315
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,770
Oh yes.

316
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,210
Oh, we went out this door.

317
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,110
There's a bunch of enemies on the other side.

318
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,930
Air raid might be good when you're like, man, I absolutely don't want to do platforming.

319
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,570
True.

320
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,690
So true.

321
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,070
Okay, wait.

322
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,330
Hold attack.

323
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,210
Okay, hold on.

324
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,370
I'm beatboxing.

325
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,460
Dante, I only know two notes.

326
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,780
You can hold the button.

327
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,760
That's what I tried doing before.

328
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,200
Oh!

329
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,040
Play free bird!

330
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,300
Record!

331
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,660
He's too cool for lessons.

332
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,420
He doesn't need them.

333
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,480
Okay.

334
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,880
Do stinger.

335
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,080
It won't let me.

336
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Oh, like that?

337
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,460
Bam!

338
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,660
I just have to not put my weapon away because it takes a second for him to grab it out.

339
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,390
Wait, huh?

340
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,970
I didn't buy it.

341
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,690
So, I guess I don't have it.

342
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,290
Bing bong!

343
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,270
Look, I got the bamboo ship!

344
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,850
Oh, I have to buy it.

345
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,090
Okay.

346
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,670
We got a stone mask.

347
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,110
What is this?

348
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,630
Jojo's?

349
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,470
A mask of magic stone made by an ancient priest.

350
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,230
It is said he who dons it can walk on water.

351
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,930
I was gonna say, he who dons it works.

352
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,790
I'm now forced to give pre-birth as per the rules.

353
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,770
I don't think I have anything in the rules about that.

354
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm about to go into labor.

355
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,610
What is happening?

356
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,330
What?

357
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,430
What?

358
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,270
What's gonna happen?

359
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,950
Okay, I don't remember what I need that for.

360
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,810
So, I'm guessing I leave through here.

361
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,530
Is anybody...any baddies in here now?

362
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,490
Anyone took over?

363
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:05,850
No?

364
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,210
Okay.

365
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,810
And we just head back.

366
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,170
When

367
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,570
we are close...

368
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,330
Okay, I'm leaving.

369
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,410
I don't...

370
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,710
Where is the exit?

371
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,690
Money!

372
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,530
It's like right here?

373
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,850
Grab money.

374
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,580
Can we make a pregnancy joke?

375
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,440
What is happening?

376
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,820
Stop it!

377
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,500
Congrats on your collab with Toho.

378
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,520
Thank you!

379
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,460
Finally, something wholesome.

380
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,720
Thank you very much!

381
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,660
This is the one that we need to combo with it, right?

382
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,380
But like...

383
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
How am I supposed to...

384
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
Gosh, how am I supposed to...

385
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,560
How do you combo with this thing?

386
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,920
Sword Master?

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,420
What do you mean?

388
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,860
Oh, with Sword Master.

389
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,810
I think I don't know how to use this weapon.

390
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,210
Crazy!

391
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,490
Come on!

392
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,490
Just one more!

393
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,110
Come on!

394
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,490
Come on!

395
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,270
Just one more!

396
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,030
I got my blorb fragment.

397
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,270
This weapon scares me.

398
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,310
What's the quick change again?

399
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,850
Here we go.

400
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,170
Gotta go back to my sword.

401
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,730
For now.

402
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,170
Blorb attained.

403
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,010
Gosh, I can't...

404
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,390
I can't... I don't know.

405
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,350
Nice, there we go.

406
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,690
Okay, so maybe I go over into the middle.

407
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,450
Mint's not gonna read the notes, is she?

408
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,310
I don't know if I will.

409
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,850
What's this again?

410
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,750
Oh, the words restore the masks.

411
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,190
Sacred energy and the power to part oceans will be yours.

412
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,390
Oh, I used the mask.

413
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,420
Too good at this game, maybe?

414
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
Who's gonna appear?

415
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,460
It's LB for devil trigger, right?

416
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Just so I remember.

417
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,960
Yeah, that's a little misleading.

418
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,060
Walk on water on my butt.

419
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,040
That's not at all what I just did.

420
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,220
I'm glowing for two now.

421
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,980
Glowing?

422
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,940
Like this?

423
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,520
What's this?

424
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,220
Neo generator.

425
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,300
A magic artifact able to supply power for an eternity.

426
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,220
It is used to power the main bridge.

427
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,860
What's gonna appear here?

428
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,580
And what's this guy?

429
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,280
What is that thing?

430
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,360
What is this thing?

431
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,040
Energy crisis solved.

432
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,480
Truly.

433
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,660
Hold LB and then release for DT explosion.

434
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,160
Softens enemies before you beat the shit out of them.

435
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,760
Oh my gosh, I thought I was about to fall.

436
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,620
Thank you.

437
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,850
The mission.

438
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,450
Um...

439
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,150
What was that now?

440
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,710
We went inside that guy.

441
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,130
At least we're fine.

442
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,020
Is it under file?

443
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:41,860
No.

444
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,990
We gotta go somewhere, baby.

445
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,690
Never got this far in TMC3 and I hate spoilers so I gotta leave.

446
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,450
Okay.

447
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,110
Have fun...

448
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,990
Have fun...

449
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,050
Finishing it.

450
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,450
And then maybe you'll come back.

451
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,850
Please come back.

452
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,310
Oops, that's not what I meant to do.

453
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,040
Oh, it's this area.

454
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,320
Can I get a hint, you guys?

455
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,600
If anybody knows.

456
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,040
Don't say no help.

457
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,610
Blue door.

458
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,970
Blue door?

459
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,510
The one I just went through.

460
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,250
All the way back.

461
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,770
Okay.

462
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,290
Where's the guy here?

463
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,950
I know there's a guy in here.

464
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,910
Where is he?

465
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,470
Oh.

466
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,330
Are you kidding me right now?

467
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,030
Oh my god.

468
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,890
Are you kidding me right now?

469
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,490
What is this?

470
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,510
Oh my god.

471
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,150
Oh my god.

472
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,330
Be careful, Dante.

473
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:22,870
Be careful.

474
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,270
Where'd they go?

475
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,250
Are they coming back?

476
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,950
Oh.

477
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,170
Oh, now I get him from this side.

478
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,930
Okay, okay.

479
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,690
Get up, Dante.

480
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,390
We get him from this side now, buddy.

481
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,490
No, that's not what... Go after this guy.

482
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:39,990
Oh, okay.

483
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,750
That's fine.

484
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,790
There we go, there we go.

485
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,690
No, turn around.

487
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,170
Okay, we'll wait.

488
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,070
We'll wait for you.

489
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,890
I'm gonna go back to Trickster.

490
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,530
Oh my god.

491
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,690
Stop doing that, Dante, please.

492
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,530
No, stop, stop.

493
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,250
I know it's me, but also...

494
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:08,710
Taunt?

495
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,890
That's this button.

496
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,510
Oh, shoot.

497
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,970
I don't remember what button is taunt.

498
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,430
Oh my god, he's stinking.

499
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,390
Oh my god.

500
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,020
Is it hitting them through the thing?

501
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,500
I don't know.

502
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,640
Oh my god.

503
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,520
It doesn't even work.

504
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,080
Oh yeah, if I use Gunslinger on... Which side is it?

505
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,640
I don't remember.

506
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,660
Oh my god.

507
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,020
No!

508
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,440
Dante!

509
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,430
Can you perish, please?

510
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,570
Nope, that's not what I meant to do.

511
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,090
I meant to do maybe like that instead.

512
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,560
I don't think it's doing... I don't think it's taking damage.

513
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,980
I don't think it's taking damage.

514
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,900
It's so stinky.

515
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh my god.

516
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,600
Oh my god.

517
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,840
Alright, come back.

518
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,620
I'm just trying to get close to you!

519
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,230
Do they want me to use the guitar?

520
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,520
Where did it go?

521
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,460
Okay.

522
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,020
Oh wait.

523
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,820
This is so stupid.

524
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,290
I don't even think it hit.

525
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,810
That's so stupid.

526
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,630
No way.

527
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,730
Oh my god.

528
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,810
Maybe this guy.

529
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,140
Please!

530
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,660
Oh my god!

531
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,440
Just come here!

532
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,680
I think you're overthinking it.

533
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm just not hitting him.

534
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,800
Finally.

535
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,300
Oh my god.

536
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,380
I just couldn't hit him.

537
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,820
I just couldn't hit him.

538
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,920
Please don't make me do it again.

539
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,100
Okay.

540
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,730
Shoot.

541
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:13,990
Shoot.

542
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:14,990
Shoot.

543
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,310
Shoot.

544
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,450
Shoot.

545
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,590
Shoot.

546
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,070
Okay.

547
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,730
Run!

548
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:24,930
Run!

549
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,050
Run!

550
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Nice.

551
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,060
We got a gror.

552
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,680
Dodge!

553
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:34,900
Dodge!

554
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,220
Dodge!

555
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,040
Dodge!

556
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,260
Dodge!

557
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Dodge!

558
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,100
Nice.

559
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:42,920
Run!

560
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,220
Where is the next guy?

561
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,600
Where is our next victim?

562
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,740
Grorbs!

563
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,480
Grorbs!

564
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Schmorgeborgs!

565
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,980
That was so awesome Dante!

566
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,260
You're so cool!

567
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Wow!

568
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,600
That was so cool!

569
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,070
I'm just gonna keep going till I don't know where to go no more.

570
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,270
Is this a bridge?

571
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,110
What is this?

572
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,250
Do you need energy?

573
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,210
Or maybe...

574
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Is this the guitar lady mission?

575
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,280
I did that one last week.

576
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,100
Not last time.

577
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,360
Not last week.

578
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,080
Last time I played I beat her.

579
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,320
Oh my goodness.

580
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,200
Camera angles.

581
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm just gonna keep going.

582
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,560
Tell me when to stop.

583
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,450
Spiders!

584
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,650
Okay never mind.

585
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,490
I don't like the guitar.

586
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,930
It's too slow!

587
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,510
What the...Spiders are not good against this, right?

588
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,670
Shit, that's right.

589
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,810
No, no.

590
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,830
There's fire.

591
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,340
This guy is huge!

592
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,640
Holy moly.

593
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,780
I don't remember what's the...

594
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,920
I think that's dodge.

595
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,820
Ouch!

596
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,420
Nice!

597
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,380
Not nice!

598
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,260
Not nice!

599
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,120
Not nice!

600
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,160
Nice!

601
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,720
Oh DT!

602
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,300
You're right!

603
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,840
Thank you!

604
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,940
You're so right!

605
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,460
Thank you!

606
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,520
DT baby!

607
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,120
DT!

608
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,480
Death to you!

609
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,070
And this way.

610
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:39,970
Little

611
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,190
babies!

612
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:52,950
Oh my god.

613
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,810
I hate these dang spiders.

614
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,590
Oh my god.

615
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,610
No, that's not the gun I want.

616
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,750
Amigo!

617
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,300
No!

618
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,320
I had it for so little.

619
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,440
Oh gosh.

620
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,840
OK, we got one.

621
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,500
Where's my...Oh we did it.

622
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:31,720
OK.

623
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:32,940
Somehow.

624
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,640
Wrong gun!

625
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,380
Take that.

626
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,060
Kiwawa?

627
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,020
Where are you?

628
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
What did you say?

629
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,200
Oh.

630
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,600
Jingle starts playing.

631
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,260
We interrupt this regularly scheduled program to bring you...

632
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,220
Mintori Mirage dance...

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,720
Wait!

634
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,740
Did you upload it?

635
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,770
Jingle jangle!

636
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,410
Everybody go to Kiwawa's channel.

637
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,510
It's up here.

638
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,970
Everybody go to Kiwawa's channel.

639
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,750
I did my best to dance Mirage with her.

640
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,750
And I didn't do it very well but...

641
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,530
I'll make a tweet too.

642
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,270
Yippee!

643
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,150
You're so cute.

644
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:28,770
No, you.

645
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,550
You're so cute and sexy.

646
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,410
How do you do it?

647
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,430
I hope you're not working too hard.

648
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,350
I hope you're able to rest while you're in Japan.

649
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,410
Kiwawa!

650
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,610
Hardly working.

651
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,350
I don't think that's true.

652
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,310
I don't think that's true.

653
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:02,090
I learned it and like... I like basically just did it a bajillion times.

654
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,910
And like... I was like OK.

655
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,470
Record.

656
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,410
Just record and use the best take.

657
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,770
Oh gosh.

658
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,730
Yeah, surprise!

659
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,170
I'll retweet it later.

660
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,590
I will retweet it right now.

661
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:20,710
Surprise.

662
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,970
I was a surprise for the Mirage collab.

663
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,950
Oh my gosh.

664
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,170
You look so cute.

665
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,170
Wait, you haven't even tweeted it yet.

666
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,470
I didn't tweet it yet.

667
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,070
You didn't even tweet it!

668
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,270
OK, I'll do it later.

669
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,030
I'll do it later.

670
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:53,370
OK.

671
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,090
Alright, let's go back to my sword.

672
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,470
Rotating bridge.

673
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:00,790
Ah!

674
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,430
A bridge, you say.

675
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,910
That sounds like something we need to power.

676
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,670
Oh!

677
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,970
Looks like Don... Oh we are playing Blitzball now?

678
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,980
We are actually playing Blitzball?

679
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,680
He shoots, he scores!

680
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,750
Nice!

681
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,920
I did it!

682
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,960
I made it!

683
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,060
What's this?

684
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,500
Nothing.

685
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,060
Marble throughway.

686
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,160
No way, he's right here.

687
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,040
What?

688
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,380
Lady!

689
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,360
Woo!

690
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,450
Have fun.

691
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,150
Thank you Kyoro!

692
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,530
Why are you upset that he's dead?

693
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,070
Woohoo!

694
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,730
Dante is such a woohoo guy!

695
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,210
No!

696
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,170
His cape!

697
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,840
Thanks Jackie.

698
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:09,960
Thanks Kuro.

699
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,920
Scum.

700
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
Well, we have something in common.

701
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,080
I have a dysfunctional family too.

702
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,560
Scum.

703
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,320
The sad music.

704
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,840
I thought she was gonna shoot him lower.

705
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,660
No.

706
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,770
She wants to be alone with her feelings.

707
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,560
So he's really dead dead?

708
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,160
Yay!

709
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,040
We cleared a mission!

710
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,860
Oh...

711
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,240
We didn't get so great this time, but that's okay.

712
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,800
I haven't played the game in like two weeks.

713
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,660
That's me on the guitar.

714
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,920
No, the drums.

715
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,120
That's what I tell a sick joke.

716
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,700
What's the deal with washing machines?

717
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,060
Passing grade.

718
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,460
Yeah, C's get degrees everybody.

719
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,800
Eleven.

720
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,300
Oh, he's totally...I knew it.

721
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,800
He's alive.

722
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,740
Go towards the light.

723
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,940
Is he like back to normal?

724
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,660
Oh, she's shaking.

725
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,840
Oh...

726
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,420
Don't get too close.

727
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,600
He might sacrifice you too.

728
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,060
Virgil.

729
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,720
I don't...

730
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,000
Is he trying to get her to do his dirty work now?

731
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,790
I don't trust him.

732
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,430
Oh...

733
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:56,730
She's just got daddy issues a little bit.

734
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,150
Shut up, Baldi.

735
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,390
Sorry, Baldi is beautiful.

736
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,600
Womp womp.

737
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,600
He's not...this is not the last we're seeing of him.

738
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,460
I swear.

739
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,540
We're going to see this poopy head again.

740
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,260
I know it.

741
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,420
Oh, I missed the eleven.

742
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,900
I missed the eleven.

743
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,840
Where was it?

744
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,920
The blood.

745
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,380
Oh, it was the blood.

746
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,020
OK.

747
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,040
I did see his blood stain.

748
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,360
I was thinking it looked like very pink.

749
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,820
Revenge.

750
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,260
Give a guest from the past an adequate homecoming.

751
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,840
What does that mean?

752
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,780
Hey, I meant to help you and the Minto's are having fun.

753
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,400
I just saw the Chiara shirt with you.

754
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,380
You were so cute.

755
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,340
Thank you!

756
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,200
Oh gosh, I'm embarrassed now.

757
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,700
Thank you so much!

758
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,700
Wait, did she tweet it?

759
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,520
Now I can retweet it.

760
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,520
Mirage challenge is over.

761
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,920
But wait, there's more!

762
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,600
Oh my gosh, do you see her hand on my waist?

763
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,260
But wait, there's more!

764
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,400
I'm so happy to have a 3D now that I can do things like this too.

765
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,960
A soup!

766
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,080
Thank you Merlin!

767
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,600
Just saw your dance with Wawa so cute.

768
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,320
Thank you!

769
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,420
Snuffer stuffer, I just saw your... Don't know, I'm so sorry, I'm late.

770
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,240
Long time listener, first time caller.

771
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,000
Hearing you cough makes me want to tell you that I've had the flu for the past three days.

772
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,140
We'll make it sister.

773
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,500
We'll make it sister!

774
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,740
I hope you feel better.

775
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,580
Get well soon.

776
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,620
The waist grip.

777
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,040
If you were to do the co-op mode of this game with someone, who would you collab with?

778
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,020
There's a co-op mode?

779
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,180
I feel like I know this actually.

780
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,780
Doesn't Bijuu really like this game?

781
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,280
This series?

782
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,360
It would be fun to play with someone who really likes it.

783
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,880
I don't know her very well though.

784
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,480
So like, don't go to her and be like, you should play with Mint or anything like that.

785
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,200
But it would be fun.

786
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,720
I don't know anyone, I don't know so many other people who really like it though.

787
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,920
I think...

788
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,140
I know Oimo really likes it too.

789
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,720
Yeah.

790
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,060
But yeah.

791
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,640
Gura, Bijuu and Iris all like it as far as I know.

792
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,960
I see, I see.

793
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,080
Anyone else too?

794
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,400
Doesn't have to be Hololive obviously.

795
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,680
Obviously, obviously.

796
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:29,760
Obviously.

797
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,320
Mint waist.

798
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,300
Rinne from Face Connect.

799
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,040
I see, I see, I see.

800
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,300
Cool.

801
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,260
Guys, what should we buy?

802
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,400
If anything.

803
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,880
Do we get the air hike for Agni and Rudra?

804
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,100
I really like using them.

805
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,820
Especially because I have the jet stream.

806
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,610
I don't need drive.

807
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,270
Air hike is great.

808
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,730
It would be nice to have it for more than one weapon, right?

809
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:18,790
You'd have to have those save files with all stuff unlocked for the co-op mode.

810
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,910
One for each character.

811
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,450
Oh, I see, I see.

812
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,630
The MC series is one of my favorite games of all time.

813
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,710
I'm glad you like it.

814
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,470
I'm glad you're happy I'm playing it.

815
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,090
Thank you.

816
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:33,490
Thanks for the super chat.

817
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,950
I don't know what to do.

818
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,230
Don't forget health and DT.

819
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,350
So true.

820
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:43,930
I never forget about a blorb.

821
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,590
But I do sometimes forget about the porb.

822
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,770
Maybe we... 4 out of 7.

823
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,890
This is 2 out of 6.

824
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,490
Maybe we should get a plorb.

825
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,130
Plorb?

826
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,270
Porb?

827
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,550
I like saying plorb.

828
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,990
It kind of implies that I'm saying plurple.

829
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,070
But, you know, it's fine.

830
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:05,610
More DT.

831
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,150
Okay, let's get more DT.

832
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,950
Yeah.

833
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,010
DT, baby, DT.

834
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,410
Okay.

835
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,400
Who am I fighting?

836
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,840
What's my...

837
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,720
Who's here?

838
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,560
Where?

839
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:24,660
Who's there?

840
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,340
Oh, you.

841
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,840
Oh, you!

842
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,460
Hold on, my money.

843
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,610
Easy.

844
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,280
Where am I going?

845
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:49,700
Oh.

846
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,920
Yeah.

847
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,940
Okay.

848
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,620
Yeah.

849
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:00,960
Yeah.

850
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,600
Oh yeah.

851
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,640
What's this?

852
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,260
Devilstar!

853
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,680
Here?

854
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,100
Perhaps?

855
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,600
This hallway looks...

856
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,280
That blood stain looks awfully suspicious.

857
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,170
Just gonna avoid that.

858
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,470
The gas!

859
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,390
The gas?

860
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,910
Oh, it's these things again.

861
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:45,850
Wait.

862
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,870
These are different things.

863
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,590
Just kidding.

864
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:56,770
Yeah!

865
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,750
The gas!

866
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,550
Oh, I thought I killed him, but I guess not.

867
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,230
I'm getting in the gas.

868
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,170
I'm getting gassed.

869
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,410
They're fast!

870
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,950
Yeah!

871
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:24,610
Yes!

872
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,250
Oh, more?

873
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,470
More?

874
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,630
I'm getting...They're laughing at me!

875
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,070
You little sucker!

876
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,150
I'm okay.

877
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,830
I'm okay.

878
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,150
I breathed in the gas.

879
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,100
I breathed in the...

880
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,310
We must use our baroon.

881
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,650
It's time for a puzzle.

882
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:12,950
What's up there?

883
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,730
Come on, use your arms Dante!

884
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,110
What is this?

885
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:27,330
Three freakish looking faces are etched into the statue.

886
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,890
Now there's four of them.

887
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,590
Four freakish faces.

888
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,570
That's good alliteration.

889
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,130
Just photoshopped my face on all three of them.

890
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,110
The center face has tears of blood streaming down its face.

891
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:53,990
Okay.

892
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,810
I like the swinging chandelier, that's cool.

893
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,790
Sorry, just kidding.

894
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,970
Not hard to breathe, it's just...

895
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,250
How the hell do I get up there?

896
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,750
These are easily the most annoying enemies in the game.

897
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,710
They disappear when you face them, so you have to turn...

898
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,390
Ah, I see.

899
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,830
Oh, hello.

900
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:21,570
There we go.

901
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:22,970
I made it.

902
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:23,990
What's this?

903
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,370
No, I'm trying to investigate.

904
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:32,710
Okay.

905
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,450
Secret mission, maybe?

906
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,550
The statue looks too... happy.

907
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,250
Another one cries!

908
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,650
Three freakish faces are etched into the statue.

909
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,970
Two of the faces weep bloody tears.

910
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,030
I just wanted to destroy its happiness.

911
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,090
Instead, I was a genius.

912
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,760
Okay, good.

913
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,660
I assumed it was over here.

914
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,440
There we go.

915
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,720
Now they're all crying.

916
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,580
Yes.

917
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,940
Oh, no.

918
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,120
Oh, no!

919
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,440
Oh, no!

920
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,560
I hate this thing!

921
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,140
Oh,

922
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,180
my gosh.

923
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,640
Okay, I'm just gonna DT.

924
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,780
No, no, no.

925
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:10,920
You.

926
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,280
Please!

927
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:08,190
DT!

928
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,550
I'm wasting my DT on your stupid parry!

929
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,130
You bitch!

930
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,330
What's happening?

931
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,050
Big damage.

932
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,900
Not blast off.

933
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,550
I'm trying to take care of this stupid guy first.

934
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,170
Oh, damn.

935
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,310
I'm trying to dodge.

936
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,710
Oh, nice, nice.

937
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:59,130
We got him.

938
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,130
Okay.

939
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,970
Nope, nope.

940
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:03,610
Not blast off.

941
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:04,250
Where are you?

942
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:09,530
Not break down.

943
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:10,790
Okay.

944
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,190
Where is he?

945
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,490
Gassy?

946
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:15,870
Staryu?

947
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,910
Okay, so turn around!

948
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:29,730
Yeah,

949
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,300
we got a good amount of health back too.

950
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,620
Good, good, good.

951
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,560
Nice!

952
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,140
Gosh, I hate the Grim Reaper guy.

953
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,080
I have such trauma from the first chapter.

954
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,200
Holy...

955
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,000
The Temperance Wagon.

956
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,560
Does this break?

957
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,640
How do I get to you?

958
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,820
Just drop, Dante.

959
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:11,600
Oh, no!

960
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,820
Where am I going?

961
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,020
Hit the

962
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:24,660
other side.

963
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,500
Oh, gosh.

964
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,680
Do I have to not fall off this or something?

965
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,660
Because this is gonna...

966
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,660
Blast off!

967
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,040
Yeah!

968
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,760
Nice, nice.

969
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:49,660
Easy.

970
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,590
Why are you guys taking the train anyway?

971
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,430
Why are you taking the train?

972
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

973
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:14,590
If there were no other guys I would have just blasted him into oblivion.

974
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,650
Got him.

975
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,250
Oh my god.

976
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:33,730
I just...

977
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:39,760
How am I...Oh, he just leaves.

978
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,520
Okay, that's nice.

979
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,760
That's kind of nice, I suppose.

980
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,060
Oh, no!

981
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:45,940
Oh, shoot.

982
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,620
Blow him up.

983
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,580
We got him.

984
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,440
We got his ass.

985
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,020
That's fun.

986
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,400
Wait, but I wanted that grorb and there was also a rorb.

987
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:39,780
Hmm...

988
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,420
20,000 porb!

989
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,120
Love that squeaky.

990
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,160
No!

991
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,320
Oh my gosh.

992
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,020
I do have a devil star though.

993
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,080
I was trying to remember that.

994
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:52,920
You can go back?

995
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,460
Wait, I can?

996
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,160
Will I have to do the whole thing all over again?

997
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,380
You have to do the encounters again.

998
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,580
You can go back eventually.

999
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,950
Dante is pondering.

1000
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,810
Dante, what should we do?

1001
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,450
You have to fight them on the way back and then coming back again?

1002
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:16,830
Okay.

1003
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:23,990
Torture chamber.

1004
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,110
I like the sound of that.

1005
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:29,930
What's...

1006
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,210
This might be my first super.

1007
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,690
Wow, thank you!

1008
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,630
B-tone player.

1009
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,590
Hope you are doing well and recovering nicely.

1010
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,670
I bet Chato is sending all the health to you.

1011
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,510
Thank you!

1012
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,110
Please describe what each orb face is feeling from their expression.

1013
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:49,870
Save?

1014
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,490
Is it a boss?

1015
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,970
Oh, but if I die, I would have to just redo the whole chapter anyway.

1016
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,590
This is a fight that can get hard.

1017
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,130
But if I save, it doesn't matter.

1018
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,140
There's checkpoints.

1019
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,530
I'll do it just to make you guys feel better, but I truly think that's not how it works, right?

1020
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,730
We'll do it on three.

1021
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,330
Okay, what weapon should I use here?

1022
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,810
What would be a good weapon to use for this fight?

1023
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:39,860
Then...

1024
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,580
The only thing saving does is save your orbs.

1025
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:49,220
Okay, well, let's just go into it and see what happens.

1026
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,200
He walks up to everything so nonchalantly.

1027
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,640
Oh!

1028
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,640
Agni and Ritra.

1029
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,040
I wish I got an air hike then.

1030
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,520
He knows my stink!

1031
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,960
Speak up Dante, I can't hear you.

1032
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,160
What's wrong with your head?

1033
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,920
The stench of betrayal.

1034
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,700
But you have to go after Vergil first, so I don't have to deal with you.

1035
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,700
This guy looks hard.

1036
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,880
Oh gosh.

1037
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,560
Okay, he destroys those.

1038
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,020
Oh god, okay.

1039
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,380
This is a hard boss.

1040
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,740
It says aim for the eye, but how do I aim for the eye?

1041
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,700
Oh my god, I'm trying to dodge.

1042
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,360
I died to this boss 54 times?

1043
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,540
Oh my god.

1044
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,700
I think I'm... This is where I get filtered real.

1045
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,100
Sword Master.

1046
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,760
Oh gosh, he hits hard.

1047
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,700
Jump, jump, jump.

1048
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,940
Okay, we got a little bit of him out.

1049
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh gosh, his range is insane.

1050
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,560
Oh my gosh.

1051
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,230
What was taunt again?

1052
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,910
What was the button to taunt again?

1053
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:31,510
I can't remember.

1054
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:35,470
Minus, thank you.

1055
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,100
Hmm.

1056
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,510
Oh wait, no status.

1057
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,310
Defile.

1058
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,210
What do we have again for...

1059
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,290
For uh...

1060
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,250
I can never draw.

1061
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:10,350
Jet stream was what?

1062
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,690
Slash through enemies with increased speed.

1063
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,610
So maybe I should get air hike then.

1064
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,390
Maybe I should buy it here.

1065
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,690
Just so I can have it because it is good to have to dodge I feel.

1066
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,110
I think.

1067
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,330
Air hike.

1068
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,070
There goes all my robes.

1069
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:44,610
Oh my gosh.

1070
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:48,890
Okay, let's try it without it.

1071
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,670
Let's try it without it.

1072
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,730
We can just keep experimenting.

1073
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,700
The potty.

1074
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,100
You have to go to the ghosties room.

1075
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,040
Okay.

1076
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,560
Oh my god.

1077
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,410
I tried.

1078
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,200
Oh my god, he is so insane.

1079
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,980
The guy looks like Teemu Godzilla.

1080
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,360
Get out of here.

1081
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,240
Move Dante.

1082
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,240
But that's not what I meant to do.

1083
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,640
I'm not doing very much damage to him am I?

1084
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,640
Oh my god.

1085
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:04,900
Oi!

1086
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:05,840
Oi!

1087
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:06,560
Oi!

1088
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:07,680
I can't.

1089
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,320
I can't.

1090
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,620
I don't know how to get out of here though.

1091
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,420
I don't know how to get out of his attack.

1092
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,720
I don't want to jump fast enough.

1093
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:30,980
Nice.

1094
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,760
What?

1095
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,700
What is this?

1096
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,420
Now you are a doll.

1097
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:44,770
What's happening?

1098
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:45,370
Oh my god.

1099
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,670
Oh my god.

1100
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,060
I haven't moved there for some reason.

1101
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,380
Do I hit those?

1102
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,540
You can hit those back at him.

1103
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,760
Okay, that's what I thought it was.

1104
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,320
Holy...

1105
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,360
What's the...

1106
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,800
What is the move to roll again?

1107
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,240
It's like...

1108
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,580
I thought it was A, but I'm clearly not doing it.

1109
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,300
Lock on.

1110
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,400
Lock on.

1111
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,820
Lock on and jump left.

1112
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1113
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,360
It was the lock on that I was missing.

1114
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:33,260
Okay.

1115
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,080
9 months preggers.

1116
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:40,560
Congrats.

1117
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,620
Also, thank you guys for...

1118
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,660
telling me...

1119
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,800
for helping me out with controls.

1120
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,300
I ask literally every stream.

1121
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,680
I'm like, how do I do this again?

1122
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,480
I ask every time.

1123
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,340
I appreciate it that you guys help me.

1124
01:13:59,200 --> 01:13:59,780
Every time.

1125
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,060
Okay.

1126
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,320
I think the trickster dodge is too slow for this guy, I'm not gonna lie.

1127
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,700
Burst.

1128
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:23,340
I think the trickster dodge is like...

1129
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,220
Cause it's so...

1130
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,960
It's so like...

1131
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,700
Like there's that little bit of second...

1132
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,340
Like...

1133
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:30,960
There?

1134
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,300
I can't move, you know?

1135
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,540
Until I've completed the dodge.

1136
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,920
So I think it's...

1137
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,960
I think it's too slow.

1138
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,980
You need to level it.

1139
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,400
Ah...

1140
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,220
Very intentional.

1141
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,480
Happy stream, baby.

1142
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,080
What should we call it?

1143
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,180
What do you mean, it?

1144
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,100
What do you mean, it?

1145
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,780
Jump?

1146
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,140
Oh, wait.

1147
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,160
Jump?

1148
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,400
No, why did I do that?

1149
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,580
I was...

1150
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,060
Jump?

1151
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,000
Oh, gosh.

1152
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,140
It's so hard sometimes.

1153
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,840
Because it's also camera specific.

1154
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,050
It's like whatever way he's facing.

1155
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,980
Not whatever way the camera is.

1156
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1157
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,200
If you level trickster, it's way better.

1158
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,400
I believe that.

1159
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,200
Guys, I'm actually gonna go to the little ghost's room real quick.

1160
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:34,720
If that's okay.

1161
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,120
And then we'll do this.

1162
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,480
So give me like one minute.

1163
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,600
Everybody, stretch, get some water.

1164
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,680
I'm not gonna be that long, but you know.

1165
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,800
We are we.

1166
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,700
I'm back.

1167
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,420
I'm back, sorry.

1168
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,840
Hold on, I gotta...

1169
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,510
I gotta get to...

1170
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,240
I think I'll name mine Minky.

1171
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,640
Minky Jr. Did you wash your hands?

1172
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,220
I always wash my hands, but I guess it doesn't matter now because I just blew my nose.

1173
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,080
I gotta wash my hands again after I blew my nose.

1174
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,170
This room is kind of ASMR, isn't it?

1175
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:46,690
It's got like a nice little...

1176
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,970
Crisp to it.

1177
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,400
You wash your hands after blowing your nose?

1178
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,920
You don't?

1179
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,900
You don't wash your hands after blowing your nose?

1180
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:05,680
You get your snot all over your hands and then you go and touch everything?

1181
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,410
I wash right before I need to touch stuff.

1182
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,130
Help is bursting out of my chest.

1183
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:27,110
I also watched the new alien movie.

1184
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:28,870
What was it called?

1185
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,230
Alien Romulus?

1186
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1187
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,250
How was it?

1188
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,370
Was it good?

1189
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:42,870
Honestly?

1190
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,470
It's a bunch of teenagers.

1191
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,630
And I was like, oh, maybe because they're children, they're gonna go easy on them.

1192
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:01,810
I was like, oh, you know, I guess maybe...

1193
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,430
Surely they won't kill the children.

1194
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:09,050
I didn't like it.

1195
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:09,730
Too many references?

1196
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,530
That's fair.

1197
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,510
Minto is spoiling?

1198
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,170
What do you mean?

1199
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,470
I'm not spoiling anything.

1200
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:22,650
I'm not spoiling.

1201
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,650
I didn't say anything.

1202
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:30,610
Let's just...

1203
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:42,940
And I also, I actually, I forgot until the part towards the end with the mutant baby.

1204
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,700
With the baby.

1205
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:53,020
Until then, I forgot that they, I had seen a behind the scenes where they, that was an actual actor.

1206
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,380
With the, the baby is an actual actor.

1207
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:09,520
Like, it's prosthetics obviously, but like, he's actually like super tall, and like, it's not, it wasn't like CGI.

1208
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,600
Which is kind of insane.

1209
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,100
The baby.

1210
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,820
Will you be playing Miisai in the future?

1211
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,480
How's your favorite thing in it?

1212
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:20,740
Women.

1213
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:28,860
I, I do want to play it, but I'm worried that like so many people have played it now that maybe people are sick of it.

1214
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,910
That's impressive, TBH.

1215
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,370
Right?

1216
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:38,770
Actually, not a Renesmee situation.

1217
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:43,530
No, he, he, like if you look him up, he's like a, he's like a, what's it called?

1218
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,750
A basketball player maybe?

1219
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:54,770
Haven't seen anyone's playthrough yet.

1220
01:21:54,810 --> 01:22:00,630
Me neither, I don't know anything about the game because I, I actually, I did buy it, I bought it before I left for Japan.

1221
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:02,970
Because I was just like, oh, I really want to play this.

1222
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,910
Seems interesting.

1223
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:08,530
And then there's also a new Chilliz Art game that came out today?

1224
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:09,130
Yesterday?

1225
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,350
So, we'll maybe, we'll maybe do that.

1226
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:21,710
I think the new Chilliz Art game, I heard, is actually quite scary.

1227
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:25,950
Yukon Time!

1228
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,750
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1229
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:29,630
Horror week, maybe.

1230
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,100
You would like me side a lot, Edwager?

1231
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,060
Am I saying it right?

1232
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:43,200
Me side, my side, my side, my lady, my side.

1233
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,100
Found baby on porch, please help!

1234
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,560
It looks like you!

1235
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:57,010
Massage.

1236
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:59,770
Mint side.

1237
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,290
I've been avoiding me side streams to watch Minky play.

1238
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:08,250
I appreciate that.

1239
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,870
Don't do that, you don't have to ever do that though.

1240
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,410
The ugliest baby was the one made by CGI for Twilight.

1241
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:16,250
I love Renesmee baby.

1242
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,870
I love how ugly it is.

1243
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,270
Say hello, welcome to membership!

1244
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,110
Thank you!

1245
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:25,950
I'm stuck!

1246
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:37,130
Oh gosh!

1247
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,090
I wish I could change the camera angle.

1248
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:47,530
Sometimes!

1249
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,900
I got his eye, I did.

1250
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,080
Go me.

1251
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,540
Turn into dog!

1252
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,220
Okay, here.

1253
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,140
Oh my god, it's so fast!

1254
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,080
Nevermind.

1255
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,040
I tried.

1256
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,900
How are you... The heck are you...

1257
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,040
Oh

1258
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,290
my god, oh my god.

1259
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:31,050
Get out of the... Get out of here Dante!

1260
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:31,290
Dante!

1261
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,880
I can't stand this man.

1262
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
Oh my god, why is Dante suddenly...

1263
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,700
I'm on 1 HP in a dream.

1264
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,440
Oh my god.

1265
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,520
I survived.

1266
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,240
I dodged.

1267
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,200
I dodged.

1268
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,020
I dodged.

1269
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,420
Why is he suddenly doing this move all of a sudden?

1270
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,200
I'm trying to do the air jump whatever...

1271
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:21,780
Airstrike!

1272
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,780
Okay, I'm glad I didn't go to him.

1273
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,020
1 HP in a dream!

1274
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,200
Wait a second.

1275
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
Do I have any save?

1276
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,840
Or do I have any...

1277
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,220
No.

1278
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,500
I have a devil star.

1279
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,260
Not worth.

1280
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,100
I don't think so either.

1281
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,720
I think if I had not 1 HP, I would use it.

1282
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,500
But I'm gonna use it...

1283
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,480
Now.

1284
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:00,380
Oh my god.

1285
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,140
Damn it.

1286
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:18,760
NT,

1287
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,260
NT.

1288
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,680
NT, NT, NT.

1289
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,000
Why?

1290
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,100
Maybe it was because I was locked on him.

1291
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,040
When I was doing...

1292
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,280
Yeah, I needed to...

1293
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,200
Wait.

1294
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,840
I don't know.

1295
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,240
Because usually I can jump in the air and it goes...

1296
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,940
I wasn't on trickster, right?

1297
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:48,260
No.

1298
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,700
Oh, it's sword master move!

1299
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,740
It's sword master mo...

1300
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,820
Maybe if I'm like...

1301
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:18,640
And then run.

1302
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,460
And run.

1303
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,660
And run.

1304
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,660
And run.

1305
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:26,960
And run.

1306
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,940
And then...

1307
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,140
Try throwing rebellion.

1308
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:32,580
What do you mean?

1309
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,260
What do you mean throwing?

1310
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,280
Like using rebellion?

1311
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,340
I don't know how to stop the things from coming at me.

1312
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,600
That was one thing too.

1313
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,960
Those were coming fast and I tried slashing at them, but...

1314
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:55,990
Hmm...

1315
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,070
Everybody, everybody...

1316
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,230
Everybody has their own ways of beating it.

1317
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,030
So all the chat is like conflicted.

1318
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:04,790
It's okay.

1319
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:07,950
I'll figure out my own way of playing it.

1320
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,670
Okay now, first try, right?

1321
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:13,950
I thought you were the ginger bird man.

1322
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:34,370
Oh shit.

1323
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:36,530
I'm trying to...

1324
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:38,590
I'm trying to get...

1325
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,750
I'm not doing a very good job.

1326
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,250
Get out of the way.

1327
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,650
Oh, he still got me.

1328
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:48,050
Son of a bitch.

1329
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:51,970
Wait, I DT'd.

1330
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:52,910
Maybe I didn't.

1331
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,760
Get out of the way, Dante.

1332
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,160
Oh, he still got me.

1333
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,190
I'm already on phase 2?

1334
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:20,330
Shut up.

1335
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:21,570
This is messed up.

1336
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,390
Don't tell me that.

1337
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:23,870
No!

1338
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,560
Okay...

1339
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,980
It didn't work.

1340
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:42,700
How am I supposed to get those?

1341
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,740
Wait, I'm just gonna die and start over.

1342
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,660
No!

1343
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,160
You gotta swing early for those.

1344
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,480
Okay, okay, okay.

1345
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:13,810
Do stinger, but press the style button instead.

1346
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:17,870
Wait.

1347
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:19,850
Like...

1348
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:20,970
That?

1349
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,720
That's not stinger though.

1350
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,000
I am holding forward.

1351
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,670
Come

1352
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,280
back to me!

1353
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,400
So...

1354
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,420
What do I...

1355
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,020
When should I use this?

1356
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:13,080
What people are trying to say is that if you do the move that throws your sword in front of you, it's easy to hit the cage as he tosses.

1357
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,420
Okay, so I'd have to like...

1358
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:18,720
Be...

1359
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,740
I'd have to be like...

1360
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,460
I'd have to be angled exactly.

1361
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,600
Okay, let's try it with this.

1362
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,720
Let's try it with this.

1363
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,640
As soon as the cage falls down.

1364
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,660
Holy moly!

1365
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,120
Okay, it's kind of nice having air hug again, I'm not gonna lie.

1366
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,100
I can't see you.

1367
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,400
Oh my god.

1368
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:51,240
I wish I had some eye frames there or something.

1369
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:52,820
That'd be really nice.

1370
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:57,720
Gosh.

1371
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,400
I really messed that up.

1372
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:02,340
Come here.

1373
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:24,560
I'm so used to...

1374
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,980
I tried to dodge.

1375
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,380
Can't dodge at all.

1376
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,170
You bitch!

1377
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:04,030
Dante, you suck!

1378
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:10,510
That was me though, I pressed the wrong thing.

1379
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,870
I'm gonna die at the...

1380
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,430
This is the worst round yet.

1381
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,850
This is the worst round yet.

1382
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,080
I'm not even gonna get to round 2 to even...

1383
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:25,420
Try!

1384
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,100
I see, I even still...

1385
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,460
God.

1386
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,020
I hate that you have to lock on to dodge.

1387
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,340
I think that's such poop.

1388
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,000
I hate that so much.

1389
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:55,510
Okay, I think for this...

1390
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,730
I think for the eye part...

1391
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:59,170
And then...

1392
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:02,490
I'll just have to be really good at switching fast, I suppose.

1393
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:07,190
I'll just have to be really...

1394
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:15,170
I don't agree about being locked on all the time though.

1395
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,030
Because being locked on versus not being locked on are two different types of moveset.

1396
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:21,550
So I think you have to like switch it around.

1397
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,920
Just gotta lock in, yeah.

1398
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,660
Okay.

1399
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,010
Get out of here, get out of here.

1400
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:00,430
Okay, nice.

1401
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,240
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

1402
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,900
Oh, and I was trapped, I was trapped.

1403
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,700
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

1404
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,700
Oh, come on.

1405
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,320
Oh, what the flip?

1406
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:25,380
Seriously?

1407
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,940
Oh gosh.

1408
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:33,100
And

1409
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:36,970
now...

1410
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:37,510
Uh, taunt?

1411
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:42,050
I messed up.

1412
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:42,610
Okay.

1413
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:54,720
Oh shoot.

1414
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,980
Okay, time for big.

1415
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,620
No, he's a dog!

1416
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:15,700
Okay, uh...

1417
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:16,700
Shit, what is this?

1418
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,220
Wait, what was the...

1419
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:19,780
Wait, wait, wait.

1420
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,640
What's the move again?

1421
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:21,880
Oh, what's the move again?

1422
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,520
What's the move again?

1423
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:31,310
Sword...

1424
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:32,750
Oh, I think I'm too late.

1425
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:37,910
I switched to rebellion.

1426
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:40,290
Lock on forward style button.

1427
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:40,750
Okay.

1428
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:42,030
Thank you.

1429
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:43,850
I think I'm too late though.

1430
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:46,110
I don't know how to dodge!

1431
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:57,390
I did it!

1432
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,270
And now there's a grorb!

1433
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,930
Oh my god, and he hit me really bad.

1434
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,230
I tried to just get the grorb, please!

1435
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:03,950
Oh my god.

1436
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:04,630
Oh,

1437
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:08,090
no!

1438
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:12,530
Holy sh...

1439
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:12,730
Hi!

1440
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:13,090
Hi!

1441
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,320
Oh

1442
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,960
my god, can he see now?

1443
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,200
I can't DT yet.

1444
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,420
I can't DT yet.

1445
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,480
Oh gosh!

1446
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,820
I can't believe I dodged that.

1447
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:41,500
Ah!

1448
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:49,760
Okay, that's fine.

1449
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:57,910
Why are you able to see now?

1450
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,550
Oh, I jumped too late.

1451
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,530
Oh, shoot.

1452
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:12,890
Okay, DT now.

1453
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:16,750
Oh, come on.

1454
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,210
Oh.

1455
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:20,650
Jump!

1456
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,750
I'm so scared, I'm shaking so bad!

1457
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,730
Can you do that?

1458
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:35,670
Can you do the thing again with the cages, you know?

1459
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:43,350
Smash!

1460
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:46,270
I thought I at least attacked him a little bit though.

1461
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:47,170
Damn.

1462
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:49,150
I don't know if he got me or...

1463
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,780
Smash!

1464
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:27,820
My legs... I mean my arms are jello right now.

1465
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,520
Ah!

1466
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,020
Shoot whenever far away.

1467
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,300
You don't need to switch styles, just spam the shoot button.

1468
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,240
Yeah, I need to remember that.

1469
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,820
Even if it doesn't do much damage.

1470
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,300
Or any damage.

1471
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,680
Well, much damage, I can at least build DT.

1472
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,700
Oh my gosh.

1473
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,220
Second or third hardest fight?

1474
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,580
What's the first hardest fight?

1475
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,390
You'll see.

1476
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,630
It's Virgil, isn't it?

1477
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,290
Or is it the bald guy?

1478
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:19,330
Okay.

1479
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:40,620
At the very least, this is one of my favorite boss themes in the game.

1480
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,340
So it's something to look forward to when I crash my face against him.

1481
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,120
Ah...

1482
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,460
Is getting Jetstream level 2...

1483
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,680
Wait, which was this one again?

1484
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,220
Slash through multiple enemies with increased speed.

1485
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,360
Ah, maybe not.

1486
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:14,960
Beowulf is a boss worth no silver bullet strategy.

1487
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,220
There are tactics you can use, but in the end you just gotta brute force it.

1488
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,100
Seems to be the case.

1489
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,940
Wait, hold on.

1490
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:39,080
I could buy more DT.

1491
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:43,520
Wait, did I not buy this before?

1492
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,560
Maybe I didn't.

1493
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,380
Blorb, good too.

1494
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,160
Blorb though.

1495
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,600
Let's get the Blorb.

1496
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,420
Oh!

1497
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,320
I was like, did it add anything?

1498
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,640
We're on a second level now.

1499
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:18,210
Second bar.

1500
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:27,710
Also consider DT explosion.

1501
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,890
That's when you hold it down and then...

1502
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:34,410
Can I even get to that though?

1503
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,780
I'm so nervous.

1504
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:00,990
I'm trying to get out of here!

1505
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:03,450
It took out one of my things.

1506
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,300
At least I have...

1507
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,040
Oh, why did I do that?

1508
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,100
Oh my god.

1509
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:16,700
I meant to lock on.

1510
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,000
My finger slipped.

1511
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,860
Come on, get his ass.

1512
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,420
Get his ass.

1513
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,040
Oh my god.

1514
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:41,050
Aw, damn it.

1515
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,230
Maybe if I don't jump there it'll be better.

1516
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,610
See, he gets me every time.

1517
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,410
I try jumping back and he gets me.

1518
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:57,910
Maybe I should...

1519
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:02,730
That's not good.

1520
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:06,050
Okay,

1521
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:11,050
I'm gonna DT.

1522
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:28,880
Nice.

1523
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,080
Come on.

1524
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,240
Is he about to...

1525
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:44,600
Wait, wait, wait.

1526
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,540
I almost had it, I almost had it.

1527
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:48,920
This time.

1528
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:50,600
No,

1529
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,600
I got stuck.

1530
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,400
That's not fair.

1531
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,270
Did I grab it?

1532
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,690
Ugh.

1533
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,720
Jump, jump, jump!

1534
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,000
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

1535
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,220
Jump!

1536
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,200
Jump!

1537
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,500
Jump, jump, jump!

1538
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:39,980
AH!

1539
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,720
Oh, shit, that's not where I want to be.

1540
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,720
Jump!

1541
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,160
Jump!

1542
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,200
Jump!

1543
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,380
Oh no, I jumped!

1544
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:52,800
I jumped!

1545
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,120
Oh, that's not the way.

1546
01:45:58,980 --> 01:45:59,860
Oh gosh.

1547
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,640
Oh, that's not good.

1548
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,580
This is not looking so hot guys.

1549
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,640
As long as I can dodge!

1550
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,160
Until I get more... Oh shit.

1551
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,220
No!

1552
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,200
Okay, okay, okay.

1553
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,660
Oh, I jumped!

1554
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,060
I jumped.

1555
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:25,760
I jumped for real.

1556
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:28,300
Maybe I didn't take damage though.

1557
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,060
Jump!

1558
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,030
Not good.

1559
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,710
Not good.

1560
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:38,730
Jump!

1561
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,470
Jump.

1562
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,940
When does he do the crush?

1563
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,340
Like the...

1564
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,920
Cause I feel like that one's easiest to get far away from him.

1565
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:02,220
That one's easiest to get far away from him and shoot so I can at least build up some DT.

1566
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,070
Have you tried going bald?

1567
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:18,390
You gotta hit him in the eye again.

1568
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:24,010
Wait.

1569
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,030
Bald.

1570
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:32,730
Power up.

1571
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:36,590
Literally malding?

1572
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:40,410
Literally malding?

1573
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:43,590
Yeah, the guns are doing some damage.

1574
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:44,190
They are chipping.

1575
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:44,650
It's good.

1576
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:48,050
The signature move is Kabedon to the shadow realm.

1577
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:51,370
Alright, we'll bald buff.

1578
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:52,770
We'll bald buff!

1579
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:54,950
Ah!

1580
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:55,610
Wrong button.

1581
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,430
Maybe the bald took away my...

1582
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:01,250
Why is Dante dabbing?

1583
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:07,450
Okay, I feel self-conscious.

1584
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:08,630
I don't wanna be like this anymore.

1585
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:15,290
Okay.

1586
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:25,570
I never learn.

1587
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:26,230
I never learn.

1588
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,530
I never learn.

1589
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,360
Maybe I should... Okay.

1590
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:54,580
Roll.

1591
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:55,940
Roll there, Minto.

1592
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:56,780
Roll there, Minto.

1593
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:05,140
Maybe I should've...

1594
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,280
Roll, roll, roll!

1595
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:07,360
Roll!

1596
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,320
I'm trying to chip away as much as I can.

1597
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,280
So that I can...

1598
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,980
So that I can...

1599
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,100
DT and then get a good amount.

1600
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:27,780
Before getting to...

1601
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,240
Oh, shoot.

1602
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:32,440
Before getting to second phase.

1603
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,000
You know what I mean?

1604
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,700
That was terrible.

1605
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:36,620
Oh, that was terrible.

1606
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:36,700
That was terrible.

1607
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:42,240
So I think this might be my last time to hit him!

1608
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,200
I don't...

1609
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,360
And now we DT.

1610
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:52,540
Okay.

1611
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,140
I don't know.

1612
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,080
I imagine there was probably people...

1613
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,600
See?

1614
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,100
Oh no, now he's in second phase!

1615
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:58,860
Oh shit.

1616
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,620
I'm in trouble.

1617
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,520
I'm in trouble.

1618
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:10,050
Oh.

1619
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:10,370
Oh, shoot.

1620
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:11,010
Ah!

1621
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:12,810
I did it too early!

1622
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:17,950
Yeah!

1623
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,340
Two out of three!

1624
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,160
Could be worse.

1625
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,680
Oh, shoot!

1626
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:42,140
Ah!

1627
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:42,860
God.

1628
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,020
Dang it.

1629
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,880
Ah, shit!

1630
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:07,540
Ah, shit.

1631
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:09,220
Trying

1632
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:18,280
to get...

1633
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:18,620
Ah!

1634
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:23,480
Oh my god.

1635
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:24,140
Ah, fuck!

1636
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,580
Shit.

1637
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:32,680
Oh.

1638
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,620
That was such a waste.

1639
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,200
That was such a waste of DT.

1640
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:41,160
Oh no!

1641
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:41,840
Ah, shit!

1642
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:43,760
I didn't realize.

1643
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,940
I didn't realize.

1644
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:50,620
I didn't realize.

1645
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:50,840
I didn't realize.

1646
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:53,300
Sparta!

1647
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,140
What is this?

1648
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:11,240
Got to phase three, but I immediately died.

1649
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:15,860
Oh, it's the hardest attack ever.

1650
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:20,620
Oh.

1651
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,720
But we got to phase three!

1652
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,820
Let's go.

1653
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,040
Progress made.

1654
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:27,940
Exactly.

1655
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,140
I'm just... My arms are noodles right now.

1656
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:38,700
For real.

1657
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,440
That

1658
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:49,950
was not what I wanted to do at all.

1659
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:02,290
Come on.

1660
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:03,190
Come on, man.

1661
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,420
Okay, I am going to DT sooner than before though.

1662
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,490
Okay, DT.

1663
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,300
Oh, shit!

1664
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:00,520
No!

1665
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:01,420
Ah!

1666
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,800
You jerk!

1667
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:35,160
Oh, shit.

1668
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:35,820
Oh, shit.

1669
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,340
There's a grove over here, right?

1670
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:42,640
Did I miss the grove?

1671
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:44,300
I think I missed the grove.

1672
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,040
Ah!

1673
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,320
I think I missed it.

1674
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:59,990
Sorry, I'm not talking much because I'm like concentrating so much.

1675
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:18,300
Ah, shit!

1676
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,680
You bastard!

1677
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,780
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

1678
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,840
Are you kidding me right now?

1679
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,820
I thought I could just run to avoid it.

1680
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:27,660
This is so stupid.

1681
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:31,140
How am I supposed to dodge this?

1682
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,520
How am I supposed to dodge that?

1683
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,640
Oh my god!

1684
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:43,940
But hey, I learned and I applied what I learned into this fight.

1685
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:49,200
Oh my god!

1686
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:49,460
Oh my god!

1687
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:57,160
Save DT for that attack.

1688
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:00,240
Tank with DT or stay close.

1689
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:01,440
Okay.

1690
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:04,860
Okay.

1691
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,280
I still think Trickster...

1692
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,080
Oh, maybe Trickster Dash will work.

1693
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:16,220
I just have to...

1694
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,020
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

1695
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:19,960
Sheesh!

1696
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:23,660
Sheesh!

1697
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:25,240
That was scary.

1698
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:29,760
Sorry, I'm not talking so much because I'm like concentrating like heck.

1699
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:37,340
The bald buff yielded results.

1700
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:37,480
What?

1701
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:47,940
Lookit, Dante is being Sonic the Hedgehog right now.

1702
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:01,750
You have to tell us every input.

1703
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:06,770
A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, dash, A, B...

1704
01:58:08,010 --> 01:58:10,650
Jump, jump, jump, not that way, jump, not that way!

1705
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:15,310
Okay.

1706
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,500
Every time, baby.

1707
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,140
Like clockwork.

1708
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:53,190
Damn,

1709
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,840
even dodging that didn't do so much though.

1710
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:07,740
Come on, his eye is right there.

1711
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:10,780
Like I'm 100% hitting his eye.

1712
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:15,240
His eye is right there.

1713
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:02,150
Did I grab them?

1714
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:08,470
Oh shit, oh shit!

1715
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:10,910
I couldn't jump again.

1716
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:12,490
I couldn't jump, I was already in the air.

1717
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:17,930
Oh, fuck you.

1718
02:00:29,190 --> 02:00:31,510
Stupid dog, stupid dog!

1719
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,340
I only like dogs who protect my smile!

1720
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:42,680
Oh shoot.

1721
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:04,550
Shit, well actually that worked out.

1722
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:06,550
Oh no, that worked out.

1723
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,750
That worked out.

1724
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,480
Okay, DT.

1725
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,060
Oh wait, maybe not.

1726
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,820
Oh shoot, I think I messed up.

1727
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:31,380
Ah!

1728
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:33,000
Ah, dang it, I pressed the wrong button!

1729
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:43,260
Again?

1730
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,060
Again?

1731
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:44,720
What?

1732
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:45,300
Wait!

1733
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:51,720
Uh, is it, uh...

1734
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,840
Wait, uh...

1735
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,640
Wait, what?

1736
02:01:58,460 --> 02:01:59,480
What is going on?

1737
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,280
Oh, damn.

1738
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:19,580
Get me out of here.

1739
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:24,820
Why are those things there?

1740
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,470
The pillar, hiding behind the pillar does not work!

1741
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:39,790
I was so close to...

1742
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:40,730
To avoiding it.

1743
02:02:41,790 --> 02:02:43,070
Oh my god, I can't see.

1744
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:44,510
That's evil.

1745
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:04,300
What's happening?

1746
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:12,730
I'm so close to being able to DT.

1747
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,710
Damn camera!

1748
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,990
I couldn't see anything!

1749
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,570
I might need to go get some more water though.

1750
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:34,590
If that's okay.

1751
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:41,010
He was like, adding stuff...

1752
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:42,710
The pillar is coming down?

1753
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:43,530
That's new.

1754
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:48,430
I think Beowulf missed the part where that's his problem.

1755
02:03:53,070 --> 02:03:55,570
I cheesed this boss fight by only shooting.

1756
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:56,870
You are so strong.

1757
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,010
Kuso running away.

1758
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:05,710
Hey!

1759
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:09,010
It's called strategic...

1760
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:10,230
Strategic...

1761
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:11,190
Retreat.

1762
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:32,480
He misses the tackle.

1763
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:33,700
You can punish with your swords.

1764
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,760
I think...

1765
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:38,180
Another...

1766
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:40,900
Other stuff that I have to take into account...

1767
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:42,320
Is not DTing.

1768
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:43,940
I think...

1769
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,420
Maybe next fight...

1770
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:48,820
If my health is not bad...

1771
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,700
And we get pretty far down...

1772
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,280
I'll use the devil star.

1773
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,600
So that I can DT to avoid some attacks.

1774
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:20,210
Let me go get some water.

1775
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:22,510
Before we fight him.

1776
02:05:22,810 --> 02:05:24,270
You will have some more...

1777
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:25,510
Lava ASMR.

1778
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:25,870
Lava ASMR.

1779
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:29,330
But I think...

1780
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:31,640
I think I have my strategy...

1781
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:32,970
Mostly down.

1782
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:34,310
At least what works for me.

1783
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:36,750
I think I just have to refine it.

1784
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:38,010
I have to not panic.

1785
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:41,810
I think what works for me...

1786
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:42,810
Is working.

1787
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:45,270
I just have to refine it.

1788
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:47,410
So I'm getting there.

1789
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:51,210
When things get too difficult...

1790
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,610
Just remember shotgun trickster is always an option.

1791
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,250
Shotgun trickster.

1792
02:05:57,670 --> 02:05:59,010
She will be hydrated.

1793
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:01,130
I will be and you should be too.

1794
02:06:02,110 --> 02:06:02,730
Drink water.

1795
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:19,590
Lava ASMR.

1796
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:23,150
Lava ASMR.

1797
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:29,710
Give me one minute to kind of...

1798
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:32,030
Shake off the noodles.

1799
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:34,110
I'm shaking off the noodles.

1800
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:35,330
I'm shaking off the noodles.

1801
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:37,930
You're doing real good vibes for me.

1802
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:39,510
I had to change my control scheme...

1803
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:40,970
To beat this boss.

1804
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:43,070
Now I use that scheme for every DMC game.

1805
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:45,090
He'll kick it's butt.

1806
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:47,110
It's butt boss.

1807
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:48,810
I believe.

1808
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:49,950
Thank you Sparky.

1809
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:53,510
I have to beat it or else we can't progress in the game.

1810
02:07:57,290 --> 02:07:58,670
I have to beat it.

1811
02:07:59,730 --> 02:08:01,190
You should hydrate now.

1812
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:02,330
Thunder and lightning.

1813
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:05,650
Thank you boss.

1814
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:11,550
It's Friday.

1815
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,270
Are you guys having a good Friday?

1816
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:16,610
Are you guys ready for the...

1817
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:17,810
Weekend, weekend.

1818
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:26,470
Yes, beating it is guaranteed.

1819
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:27,770
It's only a matter of when.

1820
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:28,450
Exactly.

1821
02:08:29,210 --> 02:08:30,510
We will beat it.

1822
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:32,190
Just eventually.

1823
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:35,430
Just woke up I guess.

1824
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,830
Good morning.

1825
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:42,510
You know this boss was a prototype...

1826
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:45,650
For Mr. X and Ari series.

1827
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:46,890
Oh no way.

1828
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:49,730
Wait pirate, it's your birthday.

1829
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:54,590
Happy birthday to you.

1830
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:58,210
Happy birthday to you.

1831
02:08:58,210 --> 02:09:01,830
Happy birthday pirate five.

1832
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:07,570
Five.

1833
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:12,210
Happy birthday to you.

1834
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:15,710
Happy birthday.

1835
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:22,090
Nice remix.

1836
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:22,730
Thank you.

1837
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:22,810
Yeah.

1838
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:29,730
I'm just...

1839
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:31,390
I need a break.

1840
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:33,610
I need a break.

1841
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:40,070
I want to definitely beat it this time though.

1842
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:43,870
I want to beat it this time even though I'm starting to get weak in the head.

1843
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:50,190
Speed.

1844
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:54,890
Remember you told me to actually try meeting girls to increase my chances at getting a girlfriend before 30?

1845
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:59,610
I signed up for a few speed dating events the next few weeks.

1846
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:01,970
I'm doing my part.

1847
02:10:03,110 --> 02:10:04,310
Speed dating.

1848
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:08,430
Speed dating sounds so scary though.

1849
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:09,430
You're so brave.

1850
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,930
World's bravest wisp.

1851
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:12,810
You're so brave.

1852
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:14,730
Oh my gosh.

1853
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:32,120
I've seen like, sometimes conventions will have speed dating.

1854
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,920
Slow dating is scary enough.

1855
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,160
I'm rooting for you.

1856
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:52,080
Just make sure you introduce the lucky lady to Minto and she has to approve of me.

1857
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:54,920
If she doesn't approve, kick her out.

1858
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,600
Leave room for Minto.

1859
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,280
Agreed.

1860
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:07,980
Agreed.

1861
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:15,520
She has to become our girlfriend.

1862
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:24,180
My tonsils hurt.

1863
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:31,300
When I first got sick, I was like, oh my gosh, do I have strep throat?

1864
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I had like five pictures of the back of my mouth trying to make sure I didn't have a strep throat.

1865
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,900
Because I was like, my throat hurts so bad.

1866
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,160
You have no tonsils!

1867
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:56,140
Did you get to eat ice cream after they got taken out?

1868
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:10,360
I've always heard that if you get your tonsils taken out, you get to eat ice cream afterwards.

1869
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:13,820
I had a popsicle.

1870
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,680
No, just jello.

1871
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:18,860
What?

1872
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,760
We have Dr. Wisps in here.

1873
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:23,580
Send the picture, we'll give you a diagnosis.

1874
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,440
Where's your credentials?

1875
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,660
I didn't get ice cream when I got mine.

1876
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:30,600
No!

1877
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,580
From Hey Arnold?

1878
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,140
Is that not real?

1879
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:43,560
I thought art reflected life.

1880
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,540
Is that not what happens?

1881
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:52,520
I believed that my entire life.

1882
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:54,580
And afterlife.

1883
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:09,330
I also thought that was real specifically because...

1884
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:14,910
Are you telling me my afterlife is a lie?

1885
02:13:18,570 --> 02:13:19,610
Are you serious?

1886
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:21,690
I'm crying right now.

1887
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:22,670
Real tears.

1888
02:13:26,190 --> 02:13:27,790
Web of lies.

1889
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:29,570
I can't believe it.

1890
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:33,990
I can't believe it.

1891
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:36,830
I can't believe Hey Arnold would lie to me like this.

1892
02:13:40,650 --> 02:13:41,410
Don't cry.

1893
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:48,210
I'll never trust again.

1894
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,700
What if we just gotcha the weapons?

1895
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:00,300
That's not good.

1896
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:09,160
Dante is getting real impatient with me.

1897
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,220
Tonsils for ice cream isn't the best deal I've seen.

1898
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:19,860
Wait, what do you mean?

1899
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:23,040
Does your voice change after you get your tonsils taken out?

1900
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:32,000
I never had to get my tonsils taken out or my wisdom teeth taken out.

1901
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:36,420
Isn't that kind of crazy?

1902
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:39,860
My mouth is huge.

1903
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:50,460
I got my big buck tooth and also a thang.

1904
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:59,360
My dentist pulled all four of my wisdom teeth in one go.

1905
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,280
I guess my wisdom teeth never grew.

1906
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,820
I don't think they can grow now as it goes.

1907
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:17,680
Sometimes I reach back there and I try to dig to see if I can get them out.

1908
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:30,160
I'll dig there and be like, what if I can find the tooth?

1909
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:41,800
Are you doing it now?

1910
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:42,700
No.

1911
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,560
I'm just feeling it with my tongue.

1912
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,520
I'm still very wise.

1913
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:52,360
Yeah, exactly.

1914
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:53,320
We have our wisdom.

1915
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:56,200
It's in there somewhere.

1916
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,120
I can't feel them.

1917
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,120
I'm not ready!

1918
02:16:40,730 --> 02:16:42,630
You son of a gun.

1919
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:45,750
And I'll shoot you with line two.

1920
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:49,170
Oh, wrong button.

1921
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,520
I wanted to taunt.

1922
02:17:13,790 --> 02:17:15,710
Well, I'm DT.

1923
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:32,560
Okay, doggie.

1924
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:43,220
This one goes above.

1925
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:52,340
Garbs!

1926
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:53,340
Grab the garbs!

1927
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:55,240
I got them.

1928
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:04,150
Ah, shit!

1929
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,280
Oh, that's... whoopsie.

1930
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:21,500
Oh my god.

1931
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:22,380
That was close.

1932
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:24,340
Oh, shoot.

1933
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:27,500
Ah, no!

1934
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,700
I wasn't out of the...

1935
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:33,080
Out of the... what's it called?

1936
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:42,620
I wasn't out of...

1937
02:19:03,450 --> 02:19:04,710
Okay, phase three.

1938
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:05,710
Pushing mark.

1939
02:19:14,850 --> 02:19:15,870
Goes above my head.

1940
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:20,330
Nice.

1941
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:28,890
Oh my god.

1942
02:19:29,170 --> 02:19:29,490
Oh my god.

1943
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,680
Ah, shoot.

1944
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:48,580
I think I'm gonna... oh.

1945
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,810
Oh my god.

1946
02:19:55,890 --> 02:19:56,350
Oh my god.

1947
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:56,690
Oh my god.

1948
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,970
Oh my god.

1949
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:57,190
Wait.

1950
02:19:57,650 --> 02:19:59,070
No, I'm stuck!

1951
02:19:59,250 --> 02:19:59,450
I'm stuck!

1952
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:02,110
This is messed up.

1953
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:07,790
I'm losing it.

1954
02:20:07,870 --> 02:20:08,330
I'm losing it.

1955
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:08,970
I'm losing it.

1956
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:14,370
Oh, come on!

1957
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,210
Are you for real?

1958
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:40,820
I'm just gonna DT.

1959
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:50,280
Oh, shoot.

1960
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:52,540
Oh, I thought I was still in DT mode.

1961
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:54,880
No!

1962
02:20:56,980 --> 02:20:57,280
I

1963
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:02,440
fumbled at the end.

1964
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:04,360
I full hard fumbled at the end.

1965
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:12,460
I full... that was so close though.

1966
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:13,500
I think we can do it.

1967
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:14,120
I think we can do it.

1968
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:14,820
I think we can do it.

1969
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:16,260
Okay.

1970
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:19,600
That was such a good run.

1971
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,220
Until I messed up.

1972
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:22,160
Sorry.

1973
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:53,040
Oops.

1974
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:53,280
Oops.

1975
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:53,500
Oops.

1976
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:53,700
Oops.

1977
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:57,780
Oh my god.

1978
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:58,240
Oh my god.

1979
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:58,860
Oh my god.

1980
02:21:58,960 --> 02:21:59,660
Oh my god.

1981
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:01,660
Why can't I get any iframes there?

1982
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,600
It's so messed up.

1983
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:05,300
He hits me like literally two times in a row.

1984
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:30,420
Oops.

1985
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:36,960
Oh, come on.

1986
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:40,020
That's not what I meant to

1987
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:57,630
do.

1988
02:22:58,090 --> 02:22:58,870
Over my head.

1989
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:19,350
Holy cannoli.

1990
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:25,150
I meant to lock on and I'm such an idiot.

1991
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:35,760
I jumped!

1992
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:36,280
I jumped!

1993
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:37,120
I pressed A!

1994
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,100
I pressed A!

1995
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:38,540
I did!

1996
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:42,320
You ass!

1997
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:03,520
Oh my god.

1998
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:19,390
Shoot.

1999
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:25,790
I'm gonna... I tried to get out.

2000
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:38,610
Ah.

2001
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:52,150
That was close.

2002
02:24:52,850 --> 02:24:53,490
That was close.

2003
02:24:58,570 --> 02:24:59,130
Oh my god.

2004
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:00,950
I don't think I got a single hit in.

2005
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:02,850
Damn it.

2006
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:14,960
Ah!

2007
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:16,360
Oh my god.

2008
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,220
Oh my god.

2009
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:17,940
Are you kidding me?

2010
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:18,440
No.

2011
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:18,620
No.

2012
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:18,860
No.

2013
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:19,080
No.

2014
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:19,280
No.

2015
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:19,440
No.

2016
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:19,620
No.

2017
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:19,800
No.

2018
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:20,100
No.

2019
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:39,080
Grab that, please.

2020
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:48,700
Oh my god.

2021
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:50,680
I didn't realize I was not in DT anymore.

2022
02:26:02,090 --> 02:26:02,490
Fuck.

2023
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:03,510
He hits so hard.

2024
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:05,950
He hits so hard.

2025
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:07,230
What?

2026
02:26:07,230 --> 02:26:09,310
You're just gonna turn into a dog in front of me.

2027
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:17,750
This isn't the run, you guys.

2028
02:26:19,410 --> 02:26:20,770
This isn't it.

2029
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:22,010
This isn't the run.

2030
02:26:22,970 --> 02:26:23,250
No!

2031
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:39,420
Please.

2032
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:47,000
Ah, fuck me.

2033
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:49,680
Ah!

2034
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:09,580
I didn't get as close as I was before though.

2035
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:10,800
Oh shoot.

2036
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:16,660
I can't avoid this attack.

2037
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,440
Hold on.

2038
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:28,760
Just kill me.

2039
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:29,500
Just kill me.

2040
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:30,000
Just kill me.

2041
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:30,440
Just kill me.

2042
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:30,840
Just kill me.

2043
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:31,360
Just kill me.

2044
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:35,900
Just kill me.

2045
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:36,860
Just kill me, please.

2046
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:37,920
I wanna redo.

2047
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:38,920
Redo.

2048
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:39,300
Redo.

2049
02:27:39,380 --> 02:27:39,760
Redo.

2050
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:48,020
I wasn't feeling it.

2051
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:54,060
I wasn't feeling it.

2052
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,400
This is the run.

2053
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,880
If I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling it.

2054
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:03,580
You don't have to be like...

2055
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:06,020
You lost so little health.

2056
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:08,000
If I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling it.

2057
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:08,900
That's all.

2058
02:28:17,030 --> 02:28:17,510
Lucky.

2059
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:28,320
She's not feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

2060
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:30,000
Thank you, Peter!

2061
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:33,820
What would your Minto trigger form look like?

2062
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,520
Neat, but sexier.

2063
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:44,680
That's not even fast.

2064
02:29:28,550 --> 02:29:32,290
I don't know if I just ate that or not.

2065
02:29:40,510 --> 02:29:42,510
I eat it every time.

2066
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:45,130
I don't know how to dodge it.

2067
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:46,170
I seriously don't.

2068
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:54,380
I eat it every time.

2069
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:55,640
I eat it every time.

2070
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:56,920
I eat it every time.

2071
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:57,640
Fuck you.

2072
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:58,660
Fuck you.

2073
02:29:58,740 --> 02:29:59,140
Fuck you.

2074
02:29:59,220 --> 02:29:59,620
Seriously.

2075
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:19,000
Goes up.

2076
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:26,530
And...

2077
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:50,340
Crush crab.

2078
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,900
I don't know what the hell he's saying there.

2079
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:55,860
Sounds like he's saying crush crab or...

2080
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:56,380
Oh, damn.

2081
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:58,440
Oh, no!

2082
02:30:58,680 --> 02:30:59,280
Come on!

2083
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,280
Can you parry that, I wonder?

2084
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,460
Probably, right?

2085
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,800
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2086
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:29,630
Wait, I DT'd!

2087
02:31:30,210 --> 02:31:31,250
I DT'd, though!

2088
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:33,590
Oh, shit.

2089
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:34,330
Oh, I'm dead.

2090
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:34,950
Oh, fuck.

2091
02:31:35,490 --> 02:31:35,690
No!

2092
02:31:36,370 --> 02:31:36,810
Grurb!

2093
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:46,360
I don't think I had enough DT, maybe.

2094
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:46,820
What is this?

2095
02:32:01,550 --> 02:32:02,910
Crush crab.

2096
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,170
That's mean.

2097
02:32:10,530 --> 02:32:11,970
I'm not throwing a little baby tantrum.

2098
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:14,710
Oh my god!

2099
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:15,410
No way!

2100
02:32:15,470 --> 02:32:16,090
That hit me!

2101
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:36,620
Crush crab!

2102
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:39,580
Please!

2103
02:32:39,940 --> 02:32:40,320
Please!

2104
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:56,740
Devil star.

2105
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,760
Devil star time!

2106
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,260
Devil star time!

2107
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:12,390
Oh, please.

2108
02:33:12,710 --> 02:33:14,150
Can I get any hits in?

2109
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:46,720
That's mean.

2110
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:51,980
I knew using... I was like, I feel it.

2111
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,260
I feel I can do it.

2112
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:54,940
The devil star, I'll use it!

2113
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:56,540
Oh, thank you for the hocus pocus!

2114
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:57,860
Thank you!

2115
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:58,420
Oh!

2116
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,980
Cut me some slack!

2117
02:34:08,380 --> 02:34:08,920
And!

2118
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,840
Oh yeah!

2119
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:13,300
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

2120
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,000
Oh, gosh.

2121
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:22,100
Good evening, I just got home from my birthday dinner!

2122
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:23,440
Moshi moshi!

2123
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:24,860
Happy birthday!

2124
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,320
Hold on, I'll sing happy birthday after this.

2125
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:27,800
Look, it's the 11.

2126
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:33,980
Happy birthday to you!

2127
02:34:34,580 --> 02:34:36,780
Happy birthday to you!

2128
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:39,020
Happy birthday!

2129
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:40,480
Moshi moshi toshi!

2130
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:45,480
Happy birthday to you!

2131
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:53,760
Hey, to the person that said, hey VOD watcher, skip two hours ahead...

2132
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:57,520
You only have to skip an hour and 25...

2133
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,540
Instead, eat that!

2134
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:18,560
I got my medical degree from Science and Medicine University, or SCAMU for short.

2135
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:22,000
Now, please allow me to look at your diseased throat.

2136
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:23,520
It's not diseased!

2137
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:24,800
I checked it myself.

2138
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:30,840
Save!

2139
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:32,340
Save!

2140
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:34,820
Save!

2141
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:35,680
Clear!

2142
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:38,520
I'm so happy!

2143
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:42,260
Thank you!

2144
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:45,000
Congratulations on clearing!

2145
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:45,640
I did it!

2146
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:48,480
Thank you!

2147
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:55,900
Ah!

2148
02:36:05,070 --> 02:36:09,030
Oh, the purple!

2149
02:36:11,930 --> 02:36:13,830
Oh no!

2150
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:18,250
Speedify, thanks for 9 months!

2151
02:36:29,130 --> 02:36:30,170
I'll die!

2152
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:31,410
You know?

2153
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:37,510
If that's what it takes to shut you up, it bugs the crap out of me that someone talks more than I do.

2154
02:36:37,970 --> 02:36:40,210
Don't act so rashly, my boy.

2155
02:36:40,970 --> 02:36:43,590
I've got a doozy of a story for you.

2156
02:36:44,090 --> 02:36:50,770
But, if you snuff out my voice like that, I won't be able to tell it now, will I?

2157
02:37:00,810 --> 02:37:02,210
Oopsie.

2158
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:06,150
Oops.

2159
02:37:20,230 --> 02:37:20,730
Oopsie.

2160
02:37:23,730 --> 02:37:25,130
Mommy?

2161
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:45,650
What's that?

2162
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,450
It's sucking me!

2163
02:37:57,050 --> 02:37:58,110
Oh no, is this a timed?

2164
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:00,250
Oh god, is this a timed mission?

2165
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:24,670
Twelve!

2166
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:34,610
Hunter and hunted.

2167
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:35,870
And haunted.

2168
02:38:36,610 --> 02:38:38,610
Reclaim the bridge before the soul is lost forever.

2169
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:47,770
The last cough session just really got me good.

2170
02:38:47,770 --> 02:38:55,670
If this is timed, then maybe I should be able to do it, and then end it there, maybe.

2171
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:07,810
Sorry, it really got me.

2172
02:39:07,810 --> 02:39:08,470
It really hurt.

2173
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:14,490
Maybe I'll go take some medicine.

2174
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:22,520
Hurt my lungs.

2175
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:30,240
So, let me try it though.

2176
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:33,040
Let's try it.

2177
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:33,600
Oh gosh.

2178
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:37,480
The haywire neo-generator.

2179
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:43,260
He who holds this broken device is eradicated and their soul is drained in exchange for power.

2180
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,280
Okay, run!

2181
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:50,960
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2182
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:53,380
Where am I going?

2183
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:55,180
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2184
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:58,780
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2185
02:40:00,140 --> 02:40:01,000
Faster, faster!

2186
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:17,510
We have to defeat these guys anyway, right?

2187
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:19,850
Oh, they gave us orbs.

2188
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:26,340
Nice.

2189
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,940
I'm trying to... I'm trying to... I'm trying to get you.

2190
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:34,640
There we go.

2191
02:40:38,810 --> 02:40:40,570
Oh, look how much health we have.

2192
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:54,020
Oh, shoot!

2193
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:54,600
Ah, shoot!

2194
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:55,100
Ah, shoot!

2195
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:55,540
Ah, shoot!

2196
02:40:55,820 --> 02:40:56,360
Ah, shoot!

2197
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:09,450
Yeah!

2198
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:34,780
Give me, give me orbs, please.

2199
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:38,060
Orbs!

2200
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:39,020
Orbs!

2201
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:39,800
Orbs!

2202
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:40,760
Orbs!

2203
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:41,440
Thank you.

2204
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:46,840
And... Yeah!

2205
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:50,100
Oh, more.

2206
02:41:50,780 --> 02:41:51,200
Yeah!

2207
02:41:51,620 --> 02:41:52,040
Yeah!

2208
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:53,100
Yeah!

2209
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:58,020
What?

2210
02:41:58,200 --> 02:41:59,420
You still come here?

2211
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:00,540
You are not wanted!

2212
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:03,880
Oh my God, it hits my ass so good.

2213
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:07,000
My ass is grass when this guy is around.

2214
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:09,580
Nice!

2215
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:18,260
Where am I going?

2216
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,240
This way?

2217
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:22,540
Oh, no time for you.

2218
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:22,760
Sorry.

2219
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:26,420
I'm like a little... I'm like a spider.

2220
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:27,360
I'm so fast.

2221
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:28,520
Do I go down there?

2222
02:42:29,020 --> 02:42:30,240
Wait, where do I go?

2223
02:42:38,280 --> 02:42:38,780
Up?

2224
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:43,100
Up the stairs.

2225
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:46,300
Up the big grorb.

2226
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:50,040
Oh, come on!

2227
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:52,980
What is it?

2228
02:42:59,410 --> 02:43:00,810
Oh, why am I doing that?

2229
02:43:00,850 --> 02:43:01,510
I'm so stupid.

2230
02:43:03,570 --> 02:43:04,470
Oh my God.

2231
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:07,050
What am I using?

2232
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,960
There we go.

2233
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:20,460
I love stinger.

2234
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,840
I love stinger.

2235
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:22,760
Not yet.

2236
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:23,180
Hold on.

2237
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:24,100
No!

2238
02:43:28,260 --> 02:43:29,160
No, let's not.

2239
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,300
There we go.

2240
02:43:33,060 --> 02:43:33,540
Yep.

2241
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:35,620
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2242
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:37,100
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

2243
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:38,960
Yummy, yummy grorb.

2244
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:52,180
Stinger?

2245
02:43:53,060 --> 02:43:53,900
There we go.

2246
02:44:04,730 --> 02:44:05,570
Don't have time for you.

2247
02:44:05,630 --> 02:44:05,730
Sorry.

2248
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:06,730
Don't have time for you.

2249
02:44:06,810 --> 02:44:06,910
Sorry.

2250
02:44:07,190 --> 02:44:07,770
Don't have time for you.

2251
02:44:07,830 --> 02:44:07,950
Sorry.

2252
02:44:11,490 --> 02:44:12,650
Anyway, run.

2253
02:44:16,730 --> 02:44:19,450
What the hell is... Oh my God.

2254
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:21,710
Oh my God.

2255
02:44:22,490 --> 02:44:23,830
Warps for days.

2256
02:44:24,390 --> 02:44:24,910
Oh shoot.

2257
02:44:25,050 --> 02:44:25,590
Oh God.

2258
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:26,070
Oh my God.

2259
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:27,090
Please.

2260
02:44:27,330 --> 02:44:29,370
I can't see anything.

2261
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:31,710
I can't see anything!

2262
02:44:32,130 --> 02:44:33,070
This damn camera!

2263
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:38,970
I'm gonna have to defeat these guys if I wanna live, I think.

2264
02:44:39,630 --> 02:44:41,410
Oh my God, please!

2265
02:44:41,550 --> 02:44:42,190
Depth perception!

2266
02:44:44,730 --> 02:44:45,670
Oh my God.

2267
02:44:45,770 --> 02:44:46,390
Oh my God.

2268
02:44:47,290 --> 02:44:48,450
I'm just gonna double jump it.

2269
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:49,030
OK, OK, OK.

2270
02:44:50,650 --> 02:44:51,450
I'm gonna die.

2271
02:44:52,010 --> 02:44:53,610
I'm not gonna make it, you guys!

2272
02:44:57,870 --> 02:44:58,610
OK, wait.

2273
02:44:58,670 --> 02:44:59,310
This might be OK.

2274
02:45:05,710 --> 02:45:06,350
Oh, no.

2275
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:07,510
I'm totally not gonna make it.

2276
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:11,970
I'm not gonna make it!

2277
02:45:11,970 --> 02:45:12,070
Help!

2278
02:45:19,170 --> 02:45:20,330
A checkpoint!

2279
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:22,610
Oh my God.

2280
02:45:22,750 --> 02:45:24,290
You said... Whoever said that there was a checkpoint?

2281
02:45:25,010 --> 02:45:25,730
Thank you.

2282
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:27,450
Oh my God.

2283
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:28,930
Oh my God.

2284
02:45:29,210 --> 02:45:30,110
You saved me.

2285
02:45:36,410 --> 02:45:36,990
Nice.

2286
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:47,800
No breakdown.

2287
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:48,680
No breakdown.

2288
02:45:48,820 --> 02:45:49,500
No time for breakdown.

2289
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:01,080
Only stinger!

2290
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:04,670
Only stinger!

2291
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:10,560
Only stinger!

2292
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,060
Only stinger!

2293
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:13,840
Oh my God.

2294
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:14,500
Oh my God.

2295
02:46:17,060 --> 02:46:17,700
Nice.

2296
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:18,740
I think I got him.

2297
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:25,650
Nice!

2298
02:46:26,650 --> 02:46:28,910
Stinger only run, baby!

2299
02:46:29,790 --> 02:46:30,410
Nice.

2300
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:30,750
Nice.

2301
02:46:31,690 --> 02:46:34,310
I'm running and I made it.

2302
02:46:35,230 --> 02:46:35,590
Maybe?

2303
02:46:36,030 --> 02:46:36,350
I think?

2304
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,110
Yes!

2305
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:51,440
Oh,

2306
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:59,570
what the hell is this?

2307
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:04,830
Vital star?

2308
02:47:09,970 --> 02:47:10,510
Uh...

2309
02:47:10,510 --> 02:47:12,050
I don't wanna touch that?

2310
02:47:14,090 --> 02:47:16,470
Or I do wanna touch that?

2311
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:19,150
Oh!

2312
02:47:19,650 --> 02:47:20,930
It's the optional bo... Oh.

2313
02:47:21,730 --> 02:47:25,310
If I touch that, that's the... That's the juggler, right?

2314
02:47:31,170 --> 02:47:33,290
I get a bunch of red orbs.

2315
02:47:33,350 --> 02:47:33,830
I don't know.

2316
02:47:36,630 --> 02:47:38,030
I think I'm OK right now.

2317
02:47:39,150 --> 02:47:41,090
Wait, how much farther is this level?

2318
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:43,650
I did what you asked me to do.

2319
02:47:43,890 --> 02:47:45,750
Oh, we were supposed to go to the basement, right?

2320
02:47:46,910 --> 02:47:47,390
Stop.

2321
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:48,990
Stop, Onii-san.

2322
02:47:56,110 --> 02:47:57,070
Underground arena.

2323
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:03,340
Is this the end?

2324
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:05,300
Or... Please say yes.

2325
02:48:20,620 --> 02:48:21,100
Hades?

2326
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:24,100
Thank you for the super chat!

2327
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:25,900
Thank you.

2328
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:28,400
AR scores.

2329
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:33,440
Chicken race.

2330
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:39,720
Haunts.

2331
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:42,280
Wait!

2332
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:43,600
Oh, are you kidding me?

2333
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:44,400
Wait, wait.

2334
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:53,480
I thought it was just gonna be a timed stage and then it would be the over.

2335
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:02,720
That's...

2336
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:06,520
I forgot this guy was here too.

2337
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:24,480
Yes?

2338
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:25,540
Oh my god.

2339
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:30,440
What if I just run past him every time?

2340
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:33,960
Oh, OK.

2341
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:36,160
The doors...

2342
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,300
Oh, he doesn't like that.

2343
02:49:46,410 --> 02:49:47,730
OK.

2344
02:50:00,900 --> 02:50:05,800
It's damaging him the tiniest amount.

2345
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:09,260
Wait, so...

2346
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:13,650
Sorry, horse.

2347
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:16,030
Sorry, horse.

2348
02:50:16,970 --> 02:50:17,550
What's happening?

2349
02:50:18,710 --> 02:50:19,930
What the hell?

2350
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:26,960
Nevermind.

2351
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:29,080
I can't tell if he's gonna stop or not.

2352
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:33,740
The world!

2353
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:45,280
Chicken.

2354
02:50:56,780 --> 02:50:57,740
There's ice!

2355
02:50:59,240 --> 02:51:00,060
OK, hold on.

2356
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:03,900
For real, I'm gonna go get my cough medicine real quick.

2357
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:06,180
So that I can at least have it in my system.

2358
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:09,820
Give me one second.

2359
02:53:45,380 --> 02:53:46,260
Sorry, guys.

2360
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:49,760
I...

2361
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:57,300
I feel so bad that I've taken so many breaks this stream.

2362
02:53:58,100 --> 02:53:59,040
So I apologize.

2363
02:54:00,340 --> 02:54:01,320
Thank you!

2364
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:05,420
Now I'm fighting a horse.

2365
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:10,360
Oh, and he shoots rockets at me.

2366
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,600
OK, that's cool.

2367
02:54:15,620 --> 02:54:16,260
OK.

2368
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:21,240
Someone said ice earlier, maybe.

2369
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:43,300
Again?

2370
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:44,600
Oh my god.

2371
02:54:55,730 --> 02:54:57,090
Oh, I don't have airhike anymore.

2372
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:03,790
God, I can't get up to his ass.

2373
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,880
Where is he?

2374
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:30,880
Oh, it's this shit again.

2375
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:31,180
OK.

2376
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:44,670
Oh, OK.

2377
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:45,510
We're back to here.

2378
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:46,230
Alright.

2379
02:56:00,940 --> 02:56:03,040
Get up on the horse's back!

2380
02:56:10,650 --> 02:56:13,630
Oh, that's damage.

2381
02:56:22,380 --> 02:56:22,830
Again.

2382
02:56:26,010 --> 02:56:27,110
What's this?

2383
02:56:29,630 --> 02:56:30,530
OK.

2384
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:31,430
OK.

2385
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:35,820
Oh, wait.

2386
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:36,400
Ah, shoot.

2387
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:41,980
That's not what I meant to do, but whatever works, works.

2388
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:49,280
Oh my god!

2389
02:56:55,090 --> 02:56:56,010
Don't touch me.

2390
02:56:59,620 --> 02:57:00,540
Oh, shoot.

2391
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:01,560
No.

2392
02:57:02,940 --> 02:57:03,460
Why

2393
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:09,160
does that dude do such big damage?

2394
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:17,200
Oh my god, I can't with me anymore.

2395
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,700
Why do I keep pressing the wrong thing every time?

2396
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:23,360
Sorry, I'm a little flustered right now.

2397
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:28,880
OK.

2398
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:29,960
Evil horse.

2399
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:33,680
OK, we're doing this again.

2400
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:37,500
I don't really know what the orbs are.

2401
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:46,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2402
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:06,060
That's so unfair!

2403
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:08,460
Oh my god, oh my god.

2404
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,260
Stupid horse!

2405
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:26,660
Stupid horse!

2406
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:27,500
You suck!

2407
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:30,240
Thanks god.

2408
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:34,000
But it looks like you're already better at the game than last time.

2409
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:35,000
Thanks, Jake!

2410
02:58:35,580 --> 02:58:37,120
Oh wait, do I have to go through this?

2411
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:47,580
Oh god, I start so far away.

2412
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:05,300
I wanna redo, I wanna redo.

2413
02:59:07,180 --> 02:59:08,980
I wanna redo already.

2414
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:16,160
I wanna redo already.

2415
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:24,200
I wanna redo already.

2416
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:54,300
Doesn't matter where I land.

2417
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:55,440
You know I'm just gonna DC.

2418
03:00:03,070 --> 03:00:05,450
I've DC'd at the worst time.

2419
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,360
At least I got some health back.

2420
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:35,480
How did I do it before?

2421
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:43,360
This is so, this is so...

2422
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:45,740
Sorry, I'm getting a little tilted, not gonna lie.

2423
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:47,860
And it's my own doing.

2424
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:50,580
I'm mad at myself, I'm mad at myself.

2425
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:51,120
This boss is lame, sorry Minto, it's okay.

2426
03:01:51,620 --> 03:01:55,920
I wouldn't, I think I'm just, because I'm not feeling well...

2427
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:59,920
And I just...

2428
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,320
I'll kill him though, we got this.

2429
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:17,960
I have to wait for the cough medicine to kick in.

2430
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:42,000
Okay, I didn't get hurt though, that's good, I guess.

2431
03:02:46,900 --> 03:02:48,660
Is he gonna stop here?

2432
03:02:48,860 --> 03:02:49,120
Yeah.

2433
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:03,350
Nice.

2434
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:09,400
That was so fast.

2435
03:03:35,420 --> 03:03:37,680
Just saw Minto dancing with Wawa, adorable.

2436
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:39,920
Thank you!

2437
03:03:42,140 --> 03:03:42,600
Okay.

2438
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:48,120
First chicken?

2439
03:03:51,180 --> 03:03:53,020
What do you mean, what does he mean by that?

2440
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:57,220
What was the chicken?

2441
03:04:15,250 --> 03:04:19,180
Okay, I jumped up because I'm not sure how many hits I can get in...

2442
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:22,350
Before, you know, before...

2443
03:04:28,130 --> 03:04:28,970
Damn.

2444
03:04:29,250 --> 03:04:31,850
I think

2445
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:45,800
this does the most damage.

2446
03:05:09,210 --> 03:05:10,370
Nice.

2447
03:05:12,290 --> 03:05:15,310
Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.

2448
03:05:24,170 --> 03:05:25,330
Nope.

2449
03:05:29,930 --> 03:05:30,990
That sucked.

2450
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:42,480
Big damage!

2451
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:44,220
Ah!

2452
03:05:46,100 --> 03:05:47,200
Asshole.

2453
03:05:54,350 --> 03:05:58,880
I want to get on the horse's back, but...

2454
03:05:59,960 --> 03:06:01,840
I don't know if I can!

2455
03:06:19,110 --> 03:06:19,660
Please!

2456
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:22,300
So close!

2457
03:06:24,700 --> 03:06:25,800
Bitch.

2458
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:26,280
Bitch.

2459
03:06:29,980 --> 03:06:31,660
No, no, no, no!

2460
03:06:39,580 --> 03:06:40,320
Ah, shit.

2461
03:06:58,210 --> 03:06:59,450
It's okay, we got him.

2462
03:07:05,830 --> 03:07:07,070
It's okay, we got him.

2463
03:07:10,290 --> 03:07:10,770
Easy.

2464
03:07:11,550 --> 03:07:15,230
At least, that guy is not very difficult at all, which is nice.

2465
03:07:16,870 --> 03:07:19,890
I just wasn't expecting a boss and another boss.

2466
03:07:24,770 --> 03:07:25,950
Get glued!

2467
03:07:28,170 --> 03:07:29,410
What is this?

2468
03:07:31,290 --> 03:07:32,630
Beowulf is mental.

2469
03:07:32,910 --> 03:07:33,510
I know.

2470
03:07:34,330 --> 03:07:36,130
Yeah, we ate that horse.

2471
03:07:37,310 --> 03:07:39,690
I was...I was...

2472
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:41,450
Hungry.

2473
03:07:48,610 --> 03:07:50,530
We have Zawarudo power now?

2474
03:07:59,390 --> 03:08:00,830
Tokyo Dome.

2475
03:08:02,930 --> 03:08:03,650
Quicksilver.

2476
03:08:03,890 --> 03:08:04,870
Look at him go.

2477
03:08:05,350 --> 03:08:07,270
Special power that...

2478
03:08:16,270 --> 03:08:17,190
Let's go.

2479
03:08:17,190 --> 03:08:20,910
Don't change styles to Quicksilver by quickly pressing the right button twice.

2480
03:08:21,470 --> 03:08:22,230
My

2481
03:08:26,860 --> 03:08:29,820
rorbs.

2482
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:33,880
Interesting.

2483
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,420
It eats DT though.

2484
03:08:35,780 --> 03:08:36,340
Makes sense.

2485
03:08:52,360 --> 03:08:53,120
Virgil!

2486
03:08:56,420 --> 03:08:58,520
Virgil, my favorite brother.

2487
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:07,580
Oh my god, this guy.

2488
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:11,100
He's gonna take this dude out in one hit.

2489
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:13,980
And it's gonna piss me off so much.

2490
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:27,680
They are multiplying.

2491
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:29,680
They are multiplying.

2492
03:09:36,640 --> 03:09:38,180
He quartered him.

2493
03:09:45,050 --> 03:09:45,610
Uh oh.

2494
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:46,630
No.

2495
03:09:48,390 --> 03:09:48,770
No.

2496
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:49,390
No.

2497
03:09:50,590 --> 03:09:51,350
No.

2498
03:09:51,890 --> 03:09:52,650
No.

2499
03:09:53,330 --> 03:09:53,910
No.

2500
03:09:54,410 --> 03:09:55,130
No.

2501
03:10:00,330 --> 03:10:02,650
Why does he get to keep him?

2502
03:10:02,990 --> 03:10:05,670
Why does he get to absorb his power but not me?

2503
03:10:07,090 --> 03:10:09,850
He gets to absorb the most difficult boss.

2504
03:10:29,140 --> 03:10:34,700
Guys, I think the pill...my cold pill is stuck in my throat.

2505
03:10:34,980 --> 03:10:37,260
So I actually...I'm just gonna end...

2506
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:41,140
I'm actually just gonna end stream here.

2507
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:47,420
Drink water.

2508
03:10:47,540 --> 03:10:48,460
I drank it all.

2509
03:10:49,260 --> 03:10:50,440
I have to go get more.

2510
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:53,480
Okay, we're on save 3.

2511
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:54,280
Save 3.

2512
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,800
I was choking on it earlier when I went and took it.

2513
03:11:04,960 --> 03:11:07,080
I think it's stuck in my throat.

2514
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:09,200
Izumi, happy birthday!

2515
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:12,900
I'm sorry, I don't think I can sing for you right now.

2516
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:14,300
But happy, happy birthday!

2517
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:15,420
Happy birthday!

2518
03:11:15,900 --> 03:11:16,720
Yeah, chat, you sing.

2519
03:11:16,780 --> 03:11:18,380
You sing for Jimmy.

2520
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:21,480
Okay.

2521
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:22,500
Thank you everybody!

2522
03:11:23,220 --> 03:11:26,640
Sorry, today was...I had lots of fun despite not feeling well.

2523
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:28,120
I hope you guys understand.

2524
03:11:28,740 --> 03:11:32,260
I did have a lot of fun and I really enjoyed playing Devil May Cry.

2525
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:36,360
That's why I was like, oh, I'm more mission even after that hard guy, right?

2526
03:11:38,360 --> 03:11:38,800
So...

2527
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,440
I had a lot of fun!

2528
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:44,000
And hopefully I feel better soon.

2529
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:48,620
I'm sorry that I'm sick and having to take a lot of breaks and having to go take medicine and having to cough!

2530
03:11:49,660 --> 03:11:50,180
Okay.

2531
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:51,500
Otsumito!

2532
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:52,160
Thank you everybody!

2533
03:11:52,500 --> 03:11:53,200
Bye bye!
