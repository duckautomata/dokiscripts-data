whatever the thing that I want is announced it's every that

10
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:36,830

before this it was fatal frame and then time before that um

11
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:45,210
i didn't get to watch the game awards or rather i didn't get
to stream the game awards when they announced astro bot as

12
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,110

13
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:58,490

Astro Boy

15
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:26,490
Oh my gosh, it's so funny After After Ace Combat 8 was
announced, I had Gabe Jeff message me and he was like, he

16
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,430
was like, the Hornet, it's the Hornet.

17
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,970
And then what's funny too is just a couple comments, but I
got a couple people going back to my Hornet tour from last

18
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,690
year and being like, wait a second, this VTuber teased that
Ace Combat 8 was coming because...

19
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:56,090
Because the guy said that the team, Project Ace, came to the
Hornet to do 3D scans.

20
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,850
No Half-Life 3.

21
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,670
No Half-Life 3.

22
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,250
But hey, we got that new Apex game.

23
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,860
Woo!

24
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Oh yeah.

25
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,700
Oh yeah.

26
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,880
Honestly though, okay.

27
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:28,220
I'm not even so high or like so into Mega Man like I've
never played this series or anything like that but hearing

28
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:39,560
um hearing uh the song like the orchestral version of the
song while like the countdown happened and like the the the

29
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:49,920
door opening and then you see little Mega Man and you're It
was like so, it was so awesome.

30
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,340
Half-Life 3 sacrifices so long.

31
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah, let's be real.

32
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know.

33
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,060
I was going to say, let's be real.

34
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,360
We'll never get Half-Life 3, but I don't know.

35
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,660
At this point, anything could happen.

36
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,620
I saw you got all Ace Combat games.

37
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,500
I have most.

38
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,720
I think I'm missing a couple.

39
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,200
But I've been trying to collect them all.

40
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,140
I've been trying to.

41
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:30,200
hmm so they would never announce it at a show like this you
think so i don't know don't say never never say never never

42
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:42,140
say never thanks for sending the cutest pizza delivery girl
the greatest pizza are in all of london but it's so funny um

43
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:52,700
even uh just a couple weeks ago i think it was before I left
for Japan, I was going to do the first Ace Combat.

44
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,180
It's very short, so I was like, I'll just do that.

45
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,240
And then I was like, no, I think I'll start them as kind of
like a series.

46
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,580
So I pushed it back.

47
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
Now I'm like, well, dang it.

48
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
Mint foresaw the new Ace Combat game with her future side
again.

49
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,240
I can't stop winning.

50
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,880
Druids.

51
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,360
The Druids.

52
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,160
Thank you guys so much for all the super chats.

53
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,140
Thank you.

54
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,100
Super cool.

55
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,520
Wait, look at Super Cool Minto.

56
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,140
You get a 1 Plus from me.

57
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,820
Sorry for calling you out, Shalkin, on your lock screen.

58
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,280
It's just I recognize it.

59
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,280
And I was like, whoa, 1 Plus, 1 Plus user over here.

60
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Can I get some of that?

61
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
Zuz, Zuz, Zuz, Zuz, Zuz.

62
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,340
They have announced Half-Life 3 if you had completed the
ritual like a goat head's ass to you.

63
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,200
Hello, Minto.

64
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,820
Hi.

65
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,720
Thank you for 20 months.

66
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Thank you.

67
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
I was crying when I saw it.

68
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,540
I believe that.

69
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,840
I believe that.

70
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,620
Oh my gosh.

71
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,820
It's very exciting though.

72
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,800
I know that was probably not like the biggest announcement
for a lot of people.

73
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,520
And honestly, I had a feeling Expedition 33 was going to
sweep.

74
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't know anything about that game except that people
love it.

75
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,880
So I was like, I think Expedition 33 is going to take the
gold this year.

76
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,340
Where does the time go?

77
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,640
Lego Island, so nostalgic.

78
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,920
Yeah, I used to play Lego Island when I was a little wee
wisp.

79
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,680
And I was like, you know what?

80
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,160
Why not just play it again, right?

81
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,040
You can actually play this like...

82
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,180
I'm playing this on my browser.

83
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,180
Hmm.

84
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,740
So, yeah, we're just gonna be chilling today with some Lego
Island.

85
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,120
It'll be a good time.

86
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Good time, good time.

87
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,520
Question of the day.

88
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,420
Did you ever go to that e-sports thing someone emailed you
about?

89
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,860
E-sports?

90
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,430
Gin Loves!

91
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,790
Happy birthday!

92
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,890
Happy birthday, happy birthday!

93
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,170
Oh, the high school!

94
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,430
I'll be honest, I've been so busy.

95
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,170
I have, no.

96
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,010
Guys, my plate is...

97
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,270
My plate is overflowing.

98
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,870
I have too many things to do, unfortunately.

99
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,170
Moe moe boo, some Friday night pizza funds for you.

100
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,250

101
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,090

102
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,730
I got pizza!

103
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,410
I got it.

104
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,930
So, yeah.

105
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,610
Pitzer Friday, baby.

106
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,650
Vivikoi, thank you so much for the gift.

107
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,590
Thank you.

108
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,190
Thank you guys for all the welcome or welcome back.

109
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,550
Thank you everybody for returning to Membush.

110
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,530
Thank you so much.

111
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,330
Thank you.

112
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,190
Thank you.

113
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,570
I played this game and I really don't remember so much about
it.

114
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,330
So, so we're just gonna vibe with it.

115
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,090
So we're just gonna, we're just gonna have a chill time and
have, have a good time.

116
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,150
And I will count this towards the number of games that I
need to beat this year.

117
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,890
So, yeah.

118
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,730
Let's run the game, baby.

119
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,630
We gotta put in our CD.

120
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,610
Our CD-ROM.

121
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,670
Oh my god.

122
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,250
Oh my god.

123
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,150
Is the bit rate okay?

124
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,910
Why is it so...

125
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,750
Like, spooky.

126
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,810
So loud!

127
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,050
Oh my god, Twin Peaks!

128
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,930
Twin Peaks!

129
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,650
Oh my god.

130
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,210
How many frames per second is this?

131
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,610
Whoa!

132
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,890
Oh my god.

133
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,950
I'm like, it's all kind of coming back to me.

134
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,650
I'm the pizza delivery dude, the dude with the food.

135
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,470
Oh, Lee.

136
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,810
Oh, Lee.

137
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,310
Be careful, Pebble.

138
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,290
Way cool.

139
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,870
Oh, yeah.

140
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,550
I'm the dude with food.

141
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm the pizza delivery dude.

142
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,920
Oh, my God.

143
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,060
They crashed.

144
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,100
Oh, my God.

145
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,620
They're dead.

146
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,240
Oh, my God.

147
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,020
That guy's the cat.

148
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,540
Decapitated!

149
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,320
Oh yeah, jailbreak.

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,420
Oh my god, every...

151
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,540
This place seems like a hellscape.

152
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,290
That guy is literally decapitated.

153
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,550
This gore.

154
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,870

180
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:11,610

185
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,390
Oh my god, the sound is like all over the place.

186
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,030
Why don't you tell everybody?

187
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,930
It's a guest book, you know?

188
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,190
Why are we gatekeeping?

189
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,950
Who's the others?

190
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,650
Oh!

191
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,350
Okay, let's get started.

192
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,970
There's music, though.

193
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,530
Oh my god.

194
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,510
Things like racing and jet skiing and building and flying
and watching and driving and having fun and...

195
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:25,790
Yeah.

196
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,750
Well, you know, I'm not exactly sure what all there is to
do.

197
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,110
Just ask my friends.

198
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,710
You know, the only way to visit Lego Island is to become a
Lego person.

199
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:45,010
So if you click on who you want to be and drag your choice
to where you want to go on the map, you're there.

200
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,530
If you need me to tell you any more, just click on me.

201
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,150
Okay.

202
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,210
Oh my God.

203
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,910
I have to keep adjusting the music like crazy.

204
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,590
Classic game, looking forward to it.

205
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,110
He played this.

206
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,610
Yeah, me too.

207
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,910
I made pizza last night, so it was a pizza Thursday.

208
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,490
Unfortunately, my chicken and pickle pizza didn't taste as
good as the pizza shops.

209
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,570
Pickle?

210
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,070
Pickle a chicken.

211
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,210
That sounds like a Chick-fil-A sandwich.

212
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,750
Why does it sound like three?

213
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,130
Three soundtracks are playing at once.

214
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,630
Critical gamer intel.

215
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,370
The optional jukebox song brick by brick in this game gets
content ID'd by YouTube.

216
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,570
No way!

217
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,210
This game is old enough that it should be...

218
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,330
It should be like a free property at this point.

219
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,490
No?

220
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,490
Thank you for the gift of that key!

221
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,430
Hope your frame rate will be okay.

222
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,590
The turning speed in this game is based on the frame rate.

223
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,850
What's a bug for this game?

224
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,810
Well, we'll find out, I suppose.

225
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,410
Yeah, public domain!

226
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,170
Let's see.

227
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:15,970
So when I was testing this last night, my favorite thing was
clicking on everything and watching him like freak out.

228
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:17,970
What?

229
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,050
And now...

230
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,750
That didn't work as well as it did before.

231
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,230
My score cube!

232
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,050
My score cube!

233
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,150
Will you win a race or deliver a pizza?

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
Where else are we going?

235
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,780
What is this?

236
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,580
Oh!

237
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Why does this second story lead me to a...

238
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,840
Speed-owned man!

239
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,600
Wait, why are we in the ocean?

240
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,000
Big Mac, thank you for the bike and the thank you.

241
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,460
What?

242
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,800
Why does the second story bring me here?

243
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,960
Where does the third story bring us to?

244
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,340
The roof?

245
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,360
Who would have thought?

246
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,120
It's

247
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,640
time to let go of your remaining sanity.

248
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,580
Lego?

249
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,640
My ego!

250
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,020
We get such a nice view.

251
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,860
Wait, what's this?

252
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,380
Oh, my God.

253
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,500
Whoa, our...

254
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh, whoa.

255
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,940
Whoa.

256
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,180
Oh, my God.

257
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,700
Whoa.

258
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,080
Wait, how do I make this guy not green anymore?

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay, that's normal, right?

260
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,680
What is this?

261
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,740
Deploy!

262
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,290
There's a monkey in the closet.

263
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,350
Release them!

264
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,410
Peace them!

265
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,970
Be free!

266
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,430
My monkey army!

267
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,230
What's in here?

268
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,650
Another map.

269
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,110
Wait, what's in here?

270
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,030
I ain't opening the door for no man or woman alive.

271
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,250
So be gone with you.

272
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,030
And don't go in my secret cave, neither.

273
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,570
It's on the northwest side of the island.

274
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,450
Do not knock on me door there.

275
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,730
Don't go to my secret island cave.

276
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,950
Let me tell you the exact location.

277
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,350
I'll tell you one tiny clue if you leave me be.

278
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,730
Yeah?

279
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,670
And that's this.

280
00:20:52,110 --> 00:21:01,850
If ye want to pause your game at any time to count your gold
coin, like I'm doing now, then click your pause on the pause

281
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,950
button right up there on your keyboard.

282
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,250
There's a pause button on my keyboard.

283
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,090
If you want to pause your game, press the pause button.

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
I literally...

285
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
That made no sense at all.

286
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,580
There used to be.

287
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,900
No, there didn't.

288
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,740
What is this?

289
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,040
Oh, it's like the sun in the...

290
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,420
Whoa.

291
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,140
God.

292
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,860
Oh my gosh.

293
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,200
Combat!

294
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,900
Ace Combat!

295
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,120
Dog Fight!

296
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,740
Dog Fight!

297
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,100
It's gonna be so funny when I played through the Ace Combat
series and people are like, oh my gosh, she loves Ace Combat

298
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,680
so much.

299
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,040
She must be so good at the games and they're gonna see how
bad I am at dog fighting.

300
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,220
Is this the first floor?

301
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,780
Unlimited power!

302
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,090
oh

303
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,870

304
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,590

309
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,270
Oh, no, or did it not save?

310
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,280
Wait, but this all worked yesterday!

311
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,680
Don't be like this game, please!

312
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,000
No!

313
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,300
No!

314
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,260
It worked all yesterday!

315
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,740
I was clicking all over!

316
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,320
No way, it was the...

317
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,380
I released too many monkeys, maybe.

318
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,520
I think I released too many monkeys.

319
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,120
No!

320
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,860
Have you closed your browser since yesterday?

321
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,480
Of course!

322
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,960
I even shut down my PC.

323
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
I shut down my PC every night.

324
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,560
No!

325
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,400
Might want to try a Chromium browser.

326
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, maybe, right?

327
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,000
Hmm, maybe, maybe.

328
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,800
It might be Firefox.

329
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
I tried it on Firefox yesterday, though.

330
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,220
Hmm.

331
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,460
Okay.

332
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,500
That's all right, we're doing it live, we're doing it live.

333
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,540
Let's see.

334
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,340
Okay, hold on.

335
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,480
Let me open Chrome.

336
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,360
Okay.

337
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,340
Oh, my gosh.

338
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,620
Good thing I turned off the audio.

339
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,100
I had like a video that was auto-playing.

340
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,260
Let's see.

341
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,080
Lego.

342
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,960
Lego Island.

343
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,840
Lego Island.

344
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,780
You're playing the browser version.

345
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,380
Yeah.

346
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,700
That's what I said at the beginning.

347
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,760
It's so funny.

348
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,440
Let's see.

349
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,780
We're on game.

350
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,540
All right, hold on.

351
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,300
Wait.

352
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,980
Wait.

353
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,940
And red to blue.

354
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,000
Depending upon who you are, you'll see inside or out.

355
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:04,660
I'm busy Google Chrome I wonder if it'll I don't want you
guys to see my tabs all it is

356
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:21,750
now that I see them my tabs are just Metal Gear figures if
you don't like what you see you can change it

357
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,630
There are Metal Gear figures on eBay.

358
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,890
Click on me.

359
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,370

Oh, okay.

365
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,770
I think it's cropped properly.

366
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,350
Okay, good.

367
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,610
All right, we're good.

368
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:50,950
We're good.

369
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,590
Good enough.

370
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,330
We're good enough.

371
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,850
Yeah, there we go.

372
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:57,870
Okay, okay, okay.

373
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,490
I think it's cropped properly.

374
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,290
I think so.

375
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,130
It looks like it.

376
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,410

377
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:07,770

Hold on.

381
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,170

382
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,270
Okay.

383
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,270
We're doing it live.

384
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,090
We're doing it live.

385
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,170
Okay, let's just get into it.

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,430

You should try it.

452
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,600
Helicopters are a lot of fun.

453
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,240

454
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,260

listening to songs on the jukebox.

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,600

480
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,100
I hope that ambulance isn't trying to murder me again.

481
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,020
There it is.

482
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,940
Why is it doing this?

483
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,240
What's happening?

484
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,140
What is...

485
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,500
Are those just a bunch of seals?

486
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,940
Oh, they're sharks, I think.

487
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,240

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,630
It's on the east side of the island over the little bridge.

497
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,190
You know where it is, but it doesn't know where you are.

498
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,930

Okay.

537
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,310
Three.

538
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,510
Select this.

539
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,710
The chapter will rotate.

540
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,370
Four.

541
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,190
When complete, select the triangle sign.

542
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,670
You're on assignment.

543
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,530
Awesome.

544
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,230
Wait, how do I get that piece though?

545
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,730
How do I get this piece?

546
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,790
Is this...

547
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,480
Just the facts.

548
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,080
When complete, select the triangle sign.

549
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,660
And you're on assignment.

550
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,100
The switch will move the shelves to display your pieces.

551
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,520
Oh, thank you.

552
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,280
The color choices are over here.

553
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,800
Thank you.

554
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,620
Select this, and the copter will rotate.

555
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,600
Thank you.

556
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,720
Ah, here we go, here we go.

557
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,560
These sound effects.

558
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,920
Holy moly.

559
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,120
There's like something really...

560
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,760
Like, I don't mind the new Legos, but there's just something
so simple about, like...

561
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,460
I just don't like how curvy they are any like nowadays and
oh there's there was something so simple about Legos like

562
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,940
this They were so good wait.

563
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,680
Oh, how do I like change the color?

564
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
The old ones have charm.

565
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:37,020
I know it's probably my nostalgia talking But I just can't
get into like the new The new Legos that are they're just so

566
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,620
round sometimes They're just so round.

567
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,540
I can't get...

568
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,760
I know you can make more with them, but I feel like part of
the thing with Lego is like...

569
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,300
You had to be...

570
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,060
You had to get around the fact that they weren't so round.

571
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,740
You know what I mean?

572
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,820
You had to get around.

573
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,380
What even is this part?

574
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,740
What is this?

575
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,940
This one?

576
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,100
How do I change?

577
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,880
Oh, like this.

578
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,320
Ew.

579
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,600
Ew.

580
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,660
Go back to black.

581
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm afraid of the game crashing if I do too many things,
so...

582
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,380
Spoken like a true Minecraft gamer.

583
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,280
I'm just saying.

584
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,780
Oh my gosh, I almost just knocked my tea all over the place.

585
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh.

586
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,890
Uh, this one.

587
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,290
This one.

588
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:51,670
Oh.

589
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,030
Yeah.

590
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,860
Yeah, the reason I'm not changing the colors is, like I just
said, I'm afraid that if I do too much, it'll crash the

591
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,120
game.

592
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,380
Oh, wait, maybe this is the other side.

593
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,120
There we go.

594
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,080
There we go.

595
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,080
Where did the other one go?

596
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
Yeah.

597
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,660
Oh yeah.

598
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,180
Oh yeah.

599
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,600
Why does it make this sound?

600
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,440
And our final piece?

601
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,680
Excellent job.

602
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,400
Now go to the helicopter pad out front to your right.

603
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,240
By the jail.

604
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,120
And prepare for takeoff.

605
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
Oh, and one more thing.

606
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,620
Keep an eye out for the Brickster.

607
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,460
The Brickster.

608
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,480
Oh.

609
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,140
Is this the police station?

610
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,880
Okay, let's leave.

611
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,340
What was that?

612
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,000
Why is he hitting the gritty?

613
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
The helicopter maniac?

614
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Good job.

615
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,700
Let's see.

616
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,460
What was I gonna tell you?

617
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:27,920
Oh yeah.

618
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,980
The launch pad.

619
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,840
It's over there.

620
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,780
By the jail.

621
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,860
10-4.

622
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,400
Oh my god, the skib.

623
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,820
Is that...

624
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,200
Is this my skateboard?

625
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,680
Wow!

626
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,600
You're gonna have a gas on that skateboard!

627
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,780
If you want to get off, just put your hands down and hop
off.

628
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,540
Where'd he go?

629
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,260
What does that mean?

630
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,920
Just put your hands down.

631
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,700
The loudest sacks ever, right?

632
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,860
I'm sorry.

633
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,820
Pepper, or should I say paper?

634
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,640
That's how you spell it, don't you?

635
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,000
He just called me flat.

636
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,400
You can't spell or read too well.

637
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,060
Hey.

638
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,500
And illiterate.

639
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,540
I'm not the one in jail.

640
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:24,880
Oh!

641
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,780
Who else is in jail?

642
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,980
What's, wait, what's this button do?

643
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,760
Hey, condiment boy.

644
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,480
You know, seeing you has made me think.

645
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
We should be building schools, not prisons.

646
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,320
Why don't we build a school?

647
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,280
We could start with these bricks.

648
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,580
Running in place, look at him go.

649
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,560
Come on, you got this brickster.

650
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
You got this!

651
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,620
Keep going!

652
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,780
You'll make it out!

653
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,100
Why is it all concentrated in my right ear?

654
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,220
All right.

655
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,720
Oh, shoot.

656
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,880
Oh, shoot.

657
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,780
Oh, whoa.

658
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,800
Here I am!

659
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,740
What's the point of this?

660
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,000
I just get to see everything that I want?

661
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:19,800
Oh, wait.

662
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,440
Maybe it's like kind of I can travel really fast.

663
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,340
Whoa!

664
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,480
Oh my god, whoa, whoa, what's up here?

665
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,100
Okay, just to fly around for now.

666
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,020
We gotta figure out, maybe I deliver more pizzas.

667
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,140
Wait, what's this here?

668
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,340
What's this place?

669
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,220
What's that?

670
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,480
Oh, okay.

671
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,800
Uh, get me out of this?

672
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,380
If you want to get back to where you were, Just click on the
big eye in front of my desk.

673
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:57,640
Okay.

674
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,420
See you later, Brickulator.

675
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,540
Just a fun little thing.

676
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:04,980
Oh.

677
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,640
Oh, here we go.

678
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,820
Okay, you click on the hands and it gets you out.

679
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,240
Let's go, baby.

680
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,040
Let's deliver more pizza.

681
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,260
Yeah.

682
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,940
There's also something out there.

683
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,340
Something out at sea.

684
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,700
Oh, this is where the lifeguard is.

685
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,960
Oh, I can click here.

686
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,440
Go to Japan Zoo!

687
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,240
Have fun!

688
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,200
Hello, I'm Bill Ding, and you're Bill Ding.

689
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,180
Well, just a little joke.

690
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,840
I really never noticed that before.

691
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,620
Bill Ding.

692
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,040
Anyway, I just put this hat on here and whoa, I'm stooped
now.

693
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,780
Whoa, whoa.

694
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,220
Aloha.

695
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:58,960
Aloha.

696
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,380
And welcome.

697
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,380
And you're like, here to build a boat.

698
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,120
A jet ski.

699
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:02,660
Okay.

700
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,260
A jet ski.

701
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,500
That's bogus.

702
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,040
You can split anytime by clicking on the triangle.

703
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,580
Check it out.

704
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,880
That switch will move the shelves so you can grab your
pieces.

705
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,280
Okay.

706
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,900
Click and drag.

707
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,800
But drag isn't a drag.

708
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,720
You know what I mean.

709
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,480
Whoa.

710
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,820
And then check out the colors.

711
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,880
huh and then this cool panel will rotate your ski for a
better look ski and like when you're done click on the

712
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,480
triangle and somebody will bring your new jet ski out front
for you so like you can go totally bonkers in the bay

713
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:45,060
totally cool hey i gotta split swells off jailhouse rocks
six bricks high see you in the soup that was those Those

714
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,900
were words.

715
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,660
Those were words, everybody.

716
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,140
You hear all that?

717
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,460
Let's see.

718
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,320
This one now?

719
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,090
Wait, where's the other piece?

720
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,250
Am I blind?

721
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,430
Where's the other piece?

722
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:16,350
Hi.

723
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,600
It's literally not that.

724
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,660
Oh, it was like the lighting was kind of weird on it.

725
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,840
Game is made for children and I can't...

726
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,860
I don't know how to play.

727
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,240
Yeah!

728
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,020
Yeah, it was like an optical illusion for real.

729
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,780
Extremely awesome.

730
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,240
Okay, we'll bring it outside for you to splash in the pond.

731
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:57,620
Cool.

732
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,180
Thank you!

733
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,780
Very cool.

734
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,040
Oh, where'd your pants go?

735
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,120
The race begins when you pull up to that Rui out there.

736
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,640
Otherwise, you can just paddle around here.

737
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,340
Ciao.

738
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,460
There's gas in this thing?

739
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,280
Oh, I think something is trying to eat me.

740
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,780
Oh, something's trying to eat that guy.

741
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:28,780
All right?

742
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,640
Oh.

743
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,160
Was I too late?

744
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,630
Hey, they're cheating!

745
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

746
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:04,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

747
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,220
I think I killed him, man.

748
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:12,680
But that's okay.

749
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,980
I might have also saved him from sharks, who knows?

750
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,920
Do I have to, like, touch this buoy?

751
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,040
Oh, I'm stuck in the mystery triangles.

752
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,180
Oh my god, I'm stuck in the Bermuda triangle.

753
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,580
Oh my god, there she goes.

754
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,060
Wait, how do I get out?

755
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,180
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

756
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,940
Please!

757
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,600
No, please!

758
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,000
Okay, there we go.

759
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,350
Get off!

760
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,980
Where are they, though?

761
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,560
Watch out!

762
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,520
Watch out!

763
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,560
Oh, that guy's stuck in the rocks.

764
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,580
How is she getting any further ahead though?

765
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,240
It's kind of crazy.

766
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,900
Oh my god, it's it's so jerky.

767
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,160
It's like crazy.

768
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,540
Oh, I think I killed him.

769
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,460
We'll catch up.

770
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,700
We'll catch up.

771
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,640
There she is.

772
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,500
Oh,

773
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,080
we were so close!

774
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:56,420
my god is she waiting whoops jet ski pro checking in you

776
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:16,120

because i See if I needed to hit the buoys, but I was just

777
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,580
stupid.

778
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,700
They're cheating even.

779
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,300
Look at them.

780
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,260
They're getting ahead of me.

781
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,380
You think she'll be okay this time?

782
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,100
Never mind.

783
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,920
Heads up.

784
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,500
What's wrong with her?

785
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,300
What's wrong with her?

786
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,380
It feels like none of these are actual obstacles.

787
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,900
except the triangles.

788
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,180
You know?

789
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,200
Those are the only things that actually stop me.

790
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,280
Okay.

791
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,670
And then we go again.

792
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,670
This guy just is a noble sacrifice.

793
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,650
That's why she's the champ.

794
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,430
She knows the strats, clearly.

795
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,330
They're like right behind me.

796
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,310
They're on my butt.

797
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,510
It's scary.

798
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,210
This is very...

799
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:15,770
Oh, shoot.

800
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,830
Okay, I lied.

801
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,750

Okay, what does it say?

823
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,800
Super 2.

I like...

825
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,040
Number 1, I like...

826
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,800
Pineapple.

827
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,960
And...

828
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,200
I like to also get...

829
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,580
Like a green pepper and spinach...

830
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,460
And garlic.

831
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:10,960
And...

832
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,720
Mmm, sometimes!

833
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,480
Sometimes I'll get chickpeas.

834
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,390
Impossibly loud, incorrect buzzer.

835
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,510
Ah, ah, ah!

836
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,870

837
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,170
like it.

838
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,890
It's pretty much like a veggie pizza.

839
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:38,850
Yeah.

840
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,870
That I like to get.

841
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,190
What's this?

842
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,250
Okay, nothing.

843
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,090
This guy is a freak.

844
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,930
over here.

845
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,210
Oh, where'd you come from?

846
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,710
He's coming to beat me up because I just made fun of him.

847
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:55,590
Okay, just kidding.

848
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,150
I'm trying...

849
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,890
We'll do more pizza delivery, but I'm also interested in
what's going... Oh, this gang is back.

850
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,480
It feels like stuff just happens in this game.

851
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,240
Yeah, really... Why do they make a chomping sound?

852
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,120
It really does feel that way, though.

853
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,060
Stuff happens.

854
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,660
You just let it happen.

855
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,080
Motor Speedway!

856
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,600

We're drifting?

897
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,630
We're drifting?

898
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,770
Why is this like the...

899
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,830
Oh, oh.

900
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,730
No way.

901
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,830
Wait, how far did that put me back?

902
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,750
So far back!

903
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,610
No stinking way.

904
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:15,770
Oh my god, that might have cost us the entire race, you
guys!

905
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:16,150
Please!

906
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,040
His legs were open!

907
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,020
His legs were open, I swear!

908
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:39,010
It's so over.

909
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,650
It's so over.

910
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,590
Oh my god, oh my god, please, okay.

911
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,470
We made it up?

912
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,950
Giant ghost!

913
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,330
We can, we can, we can recover!

914
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:56,870
We can recover.

915
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,570
We're the best to ever do it.

916
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:01,150
I think.

917
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,830
Try an octopus!

918
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,870
Okay, we're catching up.

919
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:11,510
Kind of.

920
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,360
Oh, what the hell?

921
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,000
Why does it do

922
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:35,840
it?

923
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,180
Don't me, don't go.

924
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:38,840
I'm trying.

925
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,180
I don't know, guys.

926
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,100
I don't know.

927
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,800
I don't know.

928
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,020
We're like right on their butt.

929
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,320
It's this guy, though!

930
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,100
Caught up to at least one.

931
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,620
To Shadow the Hedgehog.

932
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,450
We caught up to Shadow the Hedgehog.

933
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,010
Alright, please, please God.

934
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:18,590
Yes!

935
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:19,730
Yes!

936
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:21,290
Yes!

937
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,490
Yes!

938
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,830
There's the other guy!

939
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,640
That's my...

940
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,560
Might be doable, everybody.

941
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:32,620
Everybody.

942
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,380
She's gaming?

943
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,040
Your honor?

944
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,620
I can't stop winning!

945
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,560
Giant ghost.

946
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,110
Is this the end?

947
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,750
Did I make-

948
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:58,250
Wait.

949
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,190
Why?

950
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,730
I- You- I woulda wipe you out.

951
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,010
But my- my colors were clashing.

952
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,410
Let's do this again sometime.

953
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,270
You sure did give me a run from my bricks.

954
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,510
Good race.

955
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:21,750
Yes, ma'am.

956
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,770
Me?

957
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,350
That's me!

958
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,530
I'm first place, baby!

959
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,130
Congratulations on a well-run race.

960
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,270
The best comeback in history.

961
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:37,070
Stud Beacon's dad, have I seen such dexterity on the track?

962
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,290
Very good.

963
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:38,970
Yes, very good.

964
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,010
You wouldn't even find this in Umu Musume.

965
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:46,490
Hereby awarded a red ring for first place.

966
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:46,910
Yeah!

967
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,830
Let's go!

968
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,310
That track was...

969
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,070
Painous.

970
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,790
This is all underneath the island?

971
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,970
Can I go through?

972
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:06,930
Take it.

973
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,030
Just a little peek.

974
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,470
Oh!

975
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,010
Wait, sir.

976
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,090
This road is closed.

977
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,450
You can't go this way, sir.

978
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,330
Sir, this road is closed.

979
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:32,530
A twist?

980
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,450
None of us could have imagined.

981
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,060
Woo!

982
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,580
Why do they get to clip through everything?

983
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,400
I can't even walk on the grass.

984
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,960
One of us?

985
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,200
Oh my gosh, please.

986
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,420
All right, so we gained...

987
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,360
I wish I had my...

988
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,240
I don't know where my skateboard is.

989
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,840
We got... Let's deliver some more pizza.

990
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,400
This soundtrack is awesome though.

991
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,260
Oh, it's here.

992
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,780
Oh, there's something...

993
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,340
They're just kidding.

994
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,240
We're doing something else.

995
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:23,900
Hello?

996
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,480
Hey, Peppa, how you doing?

997
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,060
How are those new wheels I put on for you?

998
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,000
It's like I say, life is like a skateboard.

999
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:35,020
No, that's not what I always say.

1000
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:35,960
I know.

1001
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,320
I always just say, how you doing?

1002
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,760
So how you doing?

1003
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,440
He's just like me when he tries to create a new catchphrase.

1004
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,280
DMCA song.

1005
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,940
I can't turn it off, you guys.

1006
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,460
I'm trying to get over to the track right away.

1007
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,120
It's fine.

1008
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,240
My streams are always demonetized anyway.

1009
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,220
Nancy, I can't go.

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,380
I've got two cars on the blocks already.

1011
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,120
Could you do it?

1012
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,840
I would really appreciate it.

1013
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,460
And like I always say, you scratch my brick and I'll scratch
yours.

1014
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,720
If you can do it, just pick up that tow truck hat so they'll
know you're working with me.

1015
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,080
Okay.

1016
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,100
Wait, what are we doing?

1017
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,400
Thanks.

1018
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,560
Truck's ready.

1019
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,360
It's out in front.

1020
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:23,940
Okay.

1021
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,060
I wonder why it does that.

1022
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:28,940
What, honk?

1023
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,740
I don't know.

1024
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:31,800
Thanks again.

1025
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,600
really pulled my brick out of the fire.

1026
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,860
When you get to the racetrack, race track.

1027
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,160
Pull into the parking lot, get out of the truck, and open
the gate.

1028
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:40,580
Okay.

1029
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:44,900
A couple of the mechanics will take the truck down to the
track and load the car up for you.

1030
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,820
You're doing just fine.

1031
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,100
I'm not going anywhere.

1032
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,220
How are the arrows?

1033
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,040
No.

1034
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,860
Wait, wait, wait.

1035
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,440
We can get through this, though.

1036
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:56,980
I believe.

1037
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,160
I trust.

1038
01:06:59,040 --> 01:06:59,300
See?

1039
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,080
That guy's like chilling up there too.

1040
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,500
Okay, so we said go to here.

1041
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,380
Oh, lift the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1042
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,200
Okay.

1043
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,240
When I played Lego racer...

1044
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,160
Thanks for the Super Chat!

1045
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,360
Easy?

1046
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,220
Yeah, we have...

1047
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,500
We're hacking.

1048
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,720
We're hacking?

1049
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,920
We're not going far.

1050
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,320
To pick up the toll.

1051
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,940
So, it's off we go.

1052
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,140
We'll be right back.

1053
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,360
Follow us to the track.

1054
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,900
We can do a break my brick.

1055
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,160
New karaoke song.

1056
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,140
How did it happen like that?

1057
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,780
Wait, isn't that my car?

1058
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,700
Wait, what are you doing with my car?

1059
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,960
Wait, that's my car, no?

1060
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,420
Wait a second!

1061
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,280
Wait!

1062
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,000
Mine was green.

1063
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,840
No, it was red and green.

1064
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,020
under control.

1065
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,300
See you at the garage.

1066
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:06,900
Okay.

1067
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,720
This island is like two inches long.

1068
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,660
It's a good thing you can't fix them too.

1069
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,480
Or I'd be looking for a new line of work.

1070
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,520
Wake.

1071
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,720
Yeah, it was right down the street.

1072
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,940
For a car, the first toes on me.

1073
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,940
Well, not exactly on me.

1074
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,100
That would hurt.

1075
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,960
Anyway, see you around and thanks again.

1076
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,000
Thank you!

1077
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,880
Let's go deliver some pizza.

1078
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,200
I don't know what do I run out of...

1079
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:56,320
Do I have to keep delivering pizza for the rest of my
afterlife?

1080
01:08:59,260 --> 01:08:59,640

01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:40,780
The six sense?

1088
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,860
What does that have to do with it?

1089
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,200
What does having a six sense have to do with...

1090
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,660
Huh?

1091
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,960
Hawk literally just glides.

Uh, yeah.

Papa's famous jalapeno red pepper and he's got the pizza he
wanted on the island he's delivered just a different type of

1098

you feel.

1108
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,920
No time for your touchy-feely stuff now.

1109
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,740
Come in, Infomaniac.

1110
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,320
Just interrupted her.

1111
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,140
Infomaniac.

1112
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,800
And yes, there is reason to get overly excited.

1113
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:00,460
There you are.

1114
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,940
But that won't help this terrible situation at all.

1115
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,840
Everybody's talking at once.

1116
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,420
Calm down.

1117
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,160
Who is that?

1118
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,420
But what was going through here somewhere?

1119
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,860
Why is everybody talking?

1120
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,400
Calm down.

1121
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,800
I might be able to remember what it is.

1122
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,620
Stop a nut.

1123
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,500
So why did it do?

1124
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,260
I hear the helicopter.

1125
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,300
It went behind the hill.

1126
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:24,940
The mountain park.

1127
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,580
West, that way.

1128
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,040
Okay.

1129
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,700
Ah, yes!

1130
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,840
The solution!

1131
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,460
I remember what it is.

1132
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:31,760
What?

1133
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,860
Okay, so the brickster has stolen the helicopter.

1134
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,340
Yes.

1135
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,120
And the power brick from atop our information center.

1136
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:38,520
Yes.

1137
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,900
He must have taken off to the other side of the island as
Mama just heard.

1138
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:42,820
So we...

1139
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:42,820
Yes.

1140
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,840
And I remember now that's where he went the last time he
escaped.

1141
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,360
By the residential area.

1142
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,580
By that cave.

1143
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:56,100
by northwest so we need someone to race over there someone
who could use a vehicle that can travel on roads and paths

1144
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:06,060
over ramps and in a jiffy a skateboard perhaps a skateboard
we need someone who someone maybe like you exactly like you

1145
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:12,280

1146
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:21,960

find the brickster Watch his every move and wait for Nick

1147
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,280
and Laura to show up.

1148
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,540
I'll be at the information center to figure out our next
move.

1149
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,040
Before the brickster has a chance to do whatever destiny is.

1150
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,180
The illiterate child.

1151
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,120
I had plenty of time to come up with some scheme while in
jail.

1152
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,640
Be careful, Pepper.

1153
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:36,700
Yeah.

1154
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Yeah.

1155
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,020
Hurry, Pepper.

1156
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,300
Be careful.

1157
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,360
Hurry up, Pepper.

1158
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,680
I'll go make us a pizza.

1159
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,200
Well, I just can't.

1160
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:53,440
attributed to something terrible in this town, huh?

1161
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,080
Wait, is my skateboard over there?

1162
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,900
Where is my skateboard?

1163
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,040
Attention, Pepper!

1164
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:06,920
If you can hear me, go to the residential area by the
mountain through the tunnel to the far west side of the

1165
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,240
island.

1166
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,080
Hurry!

1167
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,980
I don't know what is north or south or east or west.

1168
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,260
I think I'm stupid.

1169
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,800
It must be up here, right?

1170
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,120
They said behind the mountains?

1171
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:19,820
Hurry!

1172
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,300
Here to fight demonetization.

1173
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,300
Thank you so much!

1174
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,220
Don't worry about it at all.

1175
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,580
Police sanction skateboarding?

1176
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,820
Brist preposterous?

1177
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,620
The bricks are loose!

1178
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,540
The bricks are loose!

1179
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,150
I don't think she's all that concerned.

1180
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:45,830
Wait, what is this?

1181
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:46,310
Lost?

1182
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,310
Then go to the pizzeria.

1183

time needed to squeeze out every ounce of power they could

1189
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:42,430

1190
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,450
Follow us.

1191

Oh, whoa.

1192
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:48,790
Okay, plan A.

1193
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,870
Why do they sound Canadian sometimes?

1194
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:53,910
Nick, you check out the east side.

1195
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,570
See if you can't head him off at the path.

1196
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,290
Pepper, follow him and click on everything he drops.

1197
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,330
We need it as evidence.

1198
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,430
Let's do it, team.

1199
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,230
Keep on it, son.

1200
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,630
Oh, I get to go now.

1201
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,150
Oh my god.

1202
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:11,090
Oh my god.

1203
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:11,410
Oh my god.

1204
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,430
Oh my god, he's really...

1205
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,690
Oh my god, oh my god!

1206
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:18,610
Whoa!

1207
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,630
I'm shaking my bricks now!

1208
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,490
Hey, Peppa, deliver this!

1209
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:25,550
I got it!

1210
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,490
I took it!

1211
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,990
I don't think... I think we don't need any evidence.

1212
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,270
I think we...

1213
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,130
know exactly.

1214
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,350
Should I be faster?

1215
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,750
Music is crazy.

1216
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:42,990
Oh, wait, where'd he go?

1217
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:43,630
Uh-oh.

1218
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,130
That way.

1219
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,460
Didn't she get a map in the instruction booklet?

1220
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,000
No!

1221
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,240
I hear him.

1222
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:57,640
Oh, my God.

1223
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,880
He's really destroying stuff.

1224
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,060
Whoa, what is this?

1225
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,420
Wait, I just found a hidden treasure.

1226
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,780
Wait, this is the guy that was talking about the hidden
treasure.

1227
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,240
Oh, we have to come back.

1228
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:09,660
Uh-oh.

1229
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,040
Uh-oh.

1230
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,300
He's destroying the town.

1231
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:15,600
The

1232
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,520
pirate...

1233
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,360
How is he driving like that?

1234
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,620
What's wrong with Lego Island?

1235
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,380
Why doesn't he just leave the island?

1236
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,380
Why?

1237
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,580
We're on like the tiniest island ever.

1238
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,240
Why can't we just get him?

1239
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,140
It's the mean, mean pizza machine.

1240
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,780
That's me, baby.

1241
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,440
I wish I had my skateboard.

1242
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:50,840
Hey, Pepper.

1243
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,280
Did you order the...

1244
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:53,760
Brick?

1245
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,940
Did you order the...

1246
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:07,290
Good one, Brickster.

1247
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:08,830
Good one.

1248
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,330
You really got me there.

1249
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,570
You really owned me with that one.

1250
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,470
God, he's so fast.

1251
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:17,650
Where'd he go?

1252
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,450
Oh, there he is.

1253
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,550
He shoots!

1254
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,590
He scores!

1255
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,330
And how long am I supposed to do this for?

1256
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,300
Ahhhh!

1257
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:49,720
Achoo!

1258
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,580
Must be the pepper in the air.

1259
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,400
You may be able to catch a brick, but you can't catch me
too.

1260
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,200
Long enough.

1261
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:57,620
Hey!

1262
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,420
You're blocking the road, kid!

1263
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,400
I'm behind you!

1264
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,380
I'm here!

1265
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,640
There he goes.

1266
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,340
Where is it?

1267
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,620
What's he grabbing next?

1268
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:17,300
I didn't, like, when you, like, dismantle Legos, I didn't
think I don't think that they would like, you know, shrink

1269
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,760
like that.

1270
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,540
Oh, oh, oops, I clicked out of there.

1271
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,860
I clicked out of the tab, that's why.

1272
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:39,470
I don't think I'm on the skateboard at all.

1273
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:40,730
I'm just running.

1274
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,030
I don't know where my skateboard is.

1275
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,190
Does mint come with the pizza?

1276
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,810
No, I'm just here to deliver it, baby.

1277
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,070
Oh, my God, he's so fast.

1278
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,410
Oh, he's going to the pirate.

1279
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:04,450
There's nothing down there for you.

1280
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,760
Let's stop making that noise.

1281
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,660
Let's stop doing that.

1282
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,980
Fine, I'll hide the rest so I can rest.

1283
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,340
Oh, my God, please.

1284
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,940
Great job, pal.

1285
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:25,060
Why is he making that sound?

1286
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,580
They are the pieces of the helicopter, so we...

1287
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,520
And the bad news is, we're still missing four pieces.

1288
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,100
No!

1289
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,520
We've got to cover this island like studs on a brick.

1290
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Pepper, check everywhere.

1291
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:36,820
Everywhere?

1292
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,920
Click on it when you find one.

1293
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,500
Okay.

1294
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,580
Well, there's this one right here.

1295
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,800
Oh, no.

1296
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:45,620
No, no.

1297
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,920
No, we're not gonna do that.

1298
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,200
Wait, how do I stop that?

1299
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,460
How do I stop that sound?

1300
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,680
How do I stop that sound?

1301
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:56,860
They're everywhere.

1302
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:57,520
Wait.

1303
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,180
Oh, it's when, like, a thing.

1304
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,120
Oh, my God.

1305
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,220
It's like a...

1306
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:10,980
It's like an alert to tell me where the...

1307
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,860
Where the brick is.

1308
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,160
Oh, God.

1309
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:14,560
Okay.

1310
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,600
We gotta play the game to stop the...

1311
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,760
To save ourselves.

1312
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,440
I think I hear one up here, though.

1313
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,000
You hear?

1314
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:40,660

there's like two different soundtracks playing on top of

1317
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,190
each other?

1318
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:10,490
Three, two, two, two, three, two, two, two, two, two, two,
two, two, two, three.

1319
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,390
Thank you, y'all!

1320
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,030
Thank you!

1321
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,330
Out of the way!

1322
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:20,430
Out of the way!

1323
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,550
Hello, everybody.

1324
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:26,730
Coming in, we're playing Lego Island!

1325
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:40,670
accidentally assisted in a jailbreak and now we are um we
are suffering the karma

1326
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:54,370
oh i think it's that right there oh my god we're so close
and yet so far i think they said it was what four out of the

1327
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,590
way grandma Come on!

1328
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,670
We're suffering the karma of our actions.

1329
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:07,890
So then what?

1330
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:09,710
We got...

1331
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,690
Is this the last one?

1332
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:13,430
I guess we'll see.

1333
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,110
I wish I had my skateboard, but I do not know where it is.

1334
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,470
Okay, the closer we get.

1335
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,590
There we go.

1336
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,850
And boo.

1337
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,110
There's one more somewhere.

1338
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:44,170
Wait, I hear two.

1339
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,290
I think.

1340
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,910
You can click the pieces from anywhere.

1341
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:51,670
No way.

1342
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:52,210
Really?

1343
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,550
What is it?

1344
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,350
Which one?

1345
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:07,910
Just turn it off.

1346
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,350
Is it behind?

1347
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,090
Okay.

1348
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:13,830
Very good.

1349
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,550
Let me out.

1350
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,670
Let me out of this hellscape.

1351
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:23,070
There's There's one more.

1352
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:28,800
Well, there it is.

1353
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,040
Wait, so if I see it...

1354
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,400
Oh!

1355
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:40,280
Those policemen couldn't hear the whistling?

1356
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,760
It's probably like a dog whistle.

1357
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,660
They're too old.

1358
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,560
They can't hear it with their big adult age.

1359
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,580
Ears.

1360
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,400
Pepper is our best and most proven builder.

1361
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,640
Quickly, get to the police station and build our helicopter.

1362
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,980
I'll meet you there at the launching pad.

1363
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,620
You're done.

1364
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,040
I think we have a plan.

1365
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:58,760
Hurry!

1366
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,720
All right, let's go.

1367
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,540
Now the police station will be whistling.

1368
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:05,920
Oh!

1369
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,660
Whoa, I'll get out of your way.

1370
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,540
We're a better builder than I, so go to it.

1371
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,500
Thank you.

1372
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,760
Yeah, out of my way, out of my way.

1373
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,840
Let the professionals handle this.

1374
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,520
Oh, oops, I skipped it.

1375
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,500
All right.

1376
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,940
Master builders, though, like Lego master builders are kind
of scary.

1377
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,300
They're so good.

1378
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,260
Yeah, don't forget the rocket launcher.

1379
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,620
Pepper, good luck.

1380
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:41,400
Fly right.

1381
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,020
Wait, me?

1382
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,340
Check your angle of projection.

1383
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,680
Aim in front of the brickster and toss some donuts our way.

1384
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,740
It'll speed us up and slow him down.

1385
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,240
We're a team now.

1386
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,400
Good luck, partner.

1387
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,200
Aim right, Pepper.

1388
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,420
I don't want to be spinning on any pizzas.

1389
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:55,680
Good luck.

1390
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,660
Wait, what am I doing?

1391
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,120
You're the police!

1392
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,220
What am I?

1393
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,700
Oh, Pepper, be careful up there.

1394
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,580
Can you hear me, Pepper?

1395
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,180
This is Mama.

1396
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,440
It sounds like you're chewing well.

1397
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,280
Mama!

1398
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:13,000
Yes.

1399
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:14,860
What's happening?

1400
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,440
Oh, Pepper.

1401
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,620
Pepper will make you free pizzas for a week if you can get
that stuff.

1402
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:21,920
Oh, no!

1403
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:23,840
Wait.

1404
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:24,360
Wait.

1405
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,040
Hold on.

1406
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:27,600
What's happening?

1407
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,300
They didn't give me anything.

1408
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,520
Any...

1409
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,980
Remember, this is the little bickeroon.

1410
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,600
You're looking good, little buddy.

1411
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,720
You're on that picture like a pair of...

1412
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,160
I'd rather cause chaos.

1413
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,220
I'd rather cause chaos.

1414
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:51,380
I'd like something.

1415
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,340
Pepper, good talk.

1416
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
I wish I was up there with you, good buddy.

1417
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,840
Looks like you're having a quick, quick good time.

1418
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,860
Where's the police?

1419
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,320
Oh, you guys.

1420
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,180
Come on, come on.

1421
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,640
Go, please.

1422
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,300
Where do you go?

1423
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,140
Oh, there he is.

1424
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,980
He's heading to the pizzas.

1425
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,020
He's hungry again.

1426
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,640
No, no, no.

1427
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:42,340
Oh, good.

1428
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:42,700
He's going to.

1429
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:55,980

1431
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,580
That's the target.

1432
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:10,960
What?

1433
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,340
Officer!

1434
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,020
Officer!

1435
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,000
Thank you, Pepper.

1436
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,660
Just the energy boost I needed.

1437
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:26,980
Wait, did I lose?

1438
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,460
It's mine!

1439
01:28:50,240 --> 01:29:00,440
the boulder rolling off the cliff well it's not as bad as it
looks well maybe it is no actually you can just start again

1440
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:08,200

Start a new game?

1444
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:45,710
What's kind of messed up is that there were so many
buildings that were already destroyed because I took so long

1445
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:50,110
because I didn't have my skateboard chasing the dang
ambulance around.

1446
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:55,930

end.

1459
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,880
I didn't say a single word to him and he just kept going
off.

1460
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:33,780
Like, why I have to build all of these again?

1461
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,520
Wait, it's built.

1462
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,980
I'll get out of your way.

1463
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:38,700
You're a better builder than I, so go to it.

1464
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,760
It's already done.

1465
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,540
If I want to make it green.

1466
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,260
Everything.

1467
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:53,640
Green.

1468
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,120
Green.

1469
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,120
Green.

1470
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:00,160
What?

1471
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,540
Wait a second.

1472
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,840
Why doesn't it make it green?

1473
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,060
Just the facts.

1474
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,100
When complete.

1475
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:09,580
Yep.

1476
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yep.

1477
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:10,780
Yep.

1478
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:10,960
Yep.

1479
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:14,340
I tried.

1480
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,480
Now go to the helicopter pad out front to your right.

1481
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:18,340
By the jail.

1482
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,100
And prepare for takeoff.

1483
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,620
Oh, and one more thing.

1484
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,660
Keep an eye out for the Brickster.

1485
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,420
You guys never look at me, though, and think, dang, she's
cute.

1486
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:42,160
But I'm so confused how I'm supposed to complete that
minigame Or the like the final boss, you know Is he gonna be

1487
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:42,880
released?

1488
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:49,080
Wait, my skateboard is here Oh, it says pizza!

1489
01:33:49,860 --> 01:34:00,360
Oh my god, I couldn't read Because I am I was a stupid kid I
actually couldn't read!

1490
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,980
It said pizzazz!

1491
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:10,340
Oh my god!

1492
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:17,490
The attention to detail!

1493
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:19,050
I can't believe it!

1494
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:21,730
I actually can't believe it right now.

1495
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:22,690
Hey, no visiting!

1496
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,110
The visiting hours are over!

1497
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,350
Wait, so do I have to deliver pizzas?

1498
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:40,910
It's so nice to see you.

1499
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:44,030
Your smile always reminds me of a song.

1500
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,690
Just don't ask Papa to sing it.

1501
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:53,410
Earlier, why did they keep calling me illiterate?

1502
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:54,810
I can't believe it!

1503
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,530
I can't believe I was actually illiterate!

1504
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:02,770
I found enough ingredients in the kitchen to make 151
pizzas.

1505
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,310
151 pizzas?

1506
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:07,670
If we're so busy around here, we'll probably have to make
150 pizzas.

1507
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:09,950
151.

1508
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,450
150 pizzas, 151 pizzas.

1509
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:19,590
If we don't get some help delivering, we're going to have
150 unhappy customers.

1510
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:21,730
Hello, Laura.

1511
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:22,650
Hi.

1512
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:24,830
How can we help the Lego Islands finally?

1513
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,810
Well, I'll tell you how she can help us.

1514
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,830
Laura, we're in a spot.

1515
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:31,470
I need Pepper to deliver a bunch of pizzas.

1516
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:31,890
Yeah?

1517
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:35,170
Enter and return just ordered one for the hospital.

1518
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,750
Okay.

1519
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:36,830
Would you please take it to them?

1520
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:37,770
To the hospital?

1521
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:39,410
I don't think I've been there yet.

1522
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:41,350
Oh, thank you, Laura.

1523
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:45,470
I know this will be the safest pizza on the island.

1524
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:46,290
Pepper's gonna...

1525
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:47,610
You have to take my skateboard.

1526
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:49,810
I'll bet you'll be a real riding Betty.

1527
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:51,330
Wait, I'm gonna take the skateboard?

1528
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:56,910
You're cruising, doing some switchbacks, tail sides, or
going 540, and a bar comes up.

1529
01:35:57,190 --> 01:35:58,850
Do you grind it or sniff it?

1530
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,090
Sniff?

1531
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,530
Just don't fall down.

1532
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,290
I have a actual vehicle.

1533
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:06,310
I need.

1534
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:11,590
Let go.

1535
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:12,710
Let go.

1536
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:13,970
Okay, here we go.

1537
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:14,830
What's the hospital?

1538
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:16,270
Oh, that must be it up there.

1539
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:18,850
There's kittens in the road!

1540
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:24,750
This guy...

1541
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,930
Wait, excuse me.

1542
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:27,110
Excuse me.

1543
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,610
You must skate.

1544
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:33,790
It's like the...

1545
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,690
It's some of the...

1546
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:45,490
requirements of being a delivery boy now this is my kind of
emergency the pizza is nice and hot i think the patient

1547
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:54,050
shall live oh what if what if i didn't deliver it

1548
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:15,690
what if i had never delivered it wait a second though when
we're on our way back or rather when we're back i want to

1549
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:24,910
I wanted to go check out the pirate area.

1550
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:25,950
Everybody knows that.

1551
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:27,150
But I can dance.

1552
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:29,150
Everybody knows that.

1553
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:33,630
So what I meant to say is that you look so lovely that I
could dance.

1554
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:35,630
Pep are you good?

1555
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:50,950
Did I complete the mission?

1556
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,340
There we go.

1557
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,540
Can I actually run out of gas on this thing?

1558
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:03,360
Does it actually go down?

1559
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,600
Wait, I need to go the other way.

1560
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,280
Disassociating hard.

1561
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:11,700
For real.

1562
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:12,360
Oh, hey, darling.

1563
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:12,560
Oh.

1564
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,700
What brings you by Nubbies?

1565
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,760
I'll bet you wanted to see one of the seven wonders of Lego
Island.

1566
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,320
Well, that's us, all right.

1567
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,660
We're open 24-7, and for some reason...

1568
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:20,980
It does.

1569
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:21,700
That's crazy.

1570
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:22,360
I never get tired.

1571
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:23,200
Hmm.

1572
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,760
Of course, I'm a nervous wrench.

1573
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:27,100
Oh.

1574
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:32,300
Say, if you're here to build a car, go on inside, and it's
the next door on the right.

1575
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,440
If you're not, go on in anyway.

1576
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,460
Now you'll be just drilled to see you.

1577
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:36,980
Drilled?

1578
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,740
Sorry about the pun.

1579
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:42,120
I'm auditioning for the Lego Island Talent Show.

1580
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,200
What's the talent?

1581
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,490
Don't quit your day job.

1582
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:52,850
Oh, my gosh.

1583
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:54,910
Wait, she filled me up, though.

1584
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:58,370
Wait, maybe Lego Island is amazing.

1585
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:59,330
Gas is free.

1586
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:14,620
Wee!

1587
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:21,150
Awesome.

1588
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:25,930
Arr, I needs me beauty sleeves.

1589
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,990
Go away.

1590
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:30,270
If an I tell you's a secret, will you go away?

1591
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:30,790
Yeah.

1592
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:32,510
I, of course you would.

1593
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:39,010
Try clicking on the shift button on your keyboard and then
moving your mouse around to steer.

1594
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,250
It won't hurt your finger as much.

1595
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:48,990
But when you want to click on something else, click on the
shift again before you do to take it out of the easy to

1596
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:49,780
drive mode

1597
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:54,510
What was that?

1598
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:08,310
We'll bounce me bricks if it ain't you again I'll tell you
one more secret if in your go away.

1599
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:14,030
You can move around the island just by using the arrow keys
on your keyboard.

1600
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:17,190
Try that one and leaves me alone.

1601
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,910
How do you think I got here?

1602
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:20,730
It's not a secret.

1603
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:30,070
You know, you can take loverly pictures any place on the
island just by clicking on the print screen button on your

1604
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:37,090
keyboard and opening your Windows paint program if and when
you got one and then pasting her in.

It doesn't matter which order.

Just hurry.

1638
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:59,470
When you get to the locations, someone there will tell you
what to do.

1639
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:00,510
What's the location?

1640
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:03,490
I have no idea where I'm going.

1641
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:07,450
Uh, I'm doing Easy Drive.

1642
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:15,410
I don't know what Easy Drive does.

1643
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:28,740
The music, like, doesn't match the scenario.

1644
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:34,120
In the headlines today, Brickster's still here.

1645
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:41,980

01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:42,420
Oh, okay.

1653
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,620
Oh, okay.

1654
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:49,740
I'll click on him.

1655
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,140
Oh, he seems fine.

1656
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,300
Oh my god, easy mistake.

1657
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:01,500
Don't worry.

1658
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:04,800
If we can't save it, we can make it tomorrow night special.

1659
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:07,960
Oh my god.

1660
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,080
Everything is choking.

1661
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,760
Even the dog is choking.

1662
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:15,020
Dog ate the cat and the cat is choking.

1663
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:17,760
We gotta put up a sign.

1664
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,980
No pets allowed.

1665
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:24,100
Me, is it hard to get some slave around here or what?

1666
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,320
It's a nasty dog joke.

1667
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,080
Okay.

1668
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,380
Well, don't drop him!

1669
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,100
You mean like that other guy?

1670
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:34,640
What ever happened to him?

1671
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,260
Who?

1672
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,060
The other guy.

1673
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,540
We dropped him!

1674
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:41,080
Well, don't drop him!

1675
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:44,300
Okay.

1676
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,140
Keep going.

1677
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,480
You're doing great.

1678
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,260
Where's the other place, though?

1679
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,580
Um...

1680
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,280
At least we don't have to rebuild everything.

1681
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,160
That's kind of nice.

1682
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,080
This is a fever dream for real, y'all.

1683
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:09,420
Uh, PlayStation?

1684
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,360
Oh, yes.

1685
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,480
You're still in time.

1686
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,620
No one's calling yet.

1687
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,940
Hey, you see, there's this way.

1688
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,020
I guess we destroyed this sleep or something.

1689
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,660
We destroyed the sleep.

1690
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,460
What I need you to do is get your clown boys over there to
hold the stretcher under the roof and catch my partner when

1691
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:30,580
he comes.

1692
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,380
Oh my god.

1693
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:34,740
Oh my god.

1694
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:37,280
Why is the parrot attacking him?

1695
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,980
Not that he needs any help.

1696
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,680
But I can't help myself.

1697
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,140
You should click on the gate up there.

1698
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:49,220
Then, when the page are false, return and enter can catch
him.

1699
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:49,700
Oh.

1700
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,340
At the gate.

1701
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,600
That red stripe will drop in the driveway.

1702
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,800
Oh, you already knew that.

1703
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:55,600
Sorry.

1704
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,320
Yep.

1705
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,200
Yeah.

1706
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,440
Someone destoibed his sleep.

1707
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,480
Okay, let's bring them on home.

1708
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,740
Oh, not to my home, of course.

1709
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:10,980
It's just the victim of speech.

1710
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,060
Bring them home.

1711
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:14,620
You heard the man.

1712
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,260
Oh, sorry.

1713
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:28,450
This is so goofy.

1714
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:33,730
Birdemic Lego crossover?

1715
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:36,110
The music, though, it's so chill.

1716
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:37,030
It's putting me to sleep.

1717
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:37,330
Oh.

1718
01:48:38,230 --> 01:48:44,790
never seen such good driving you're a regular stud slinking
well i suppose i should get back to my practice uh although

1719
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:50,030
i don't know why they call it that practice i i am a doctor
already i don't really need to practice it's sort of

1720
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:53,370
redundant it's actually a little insulting stud slinking

1721
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:11,050
studs lincoln uh did i get a did i get did i get a red brick
for that So I guess I'm guessing I have to keep delivering

1722
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:11,750
pizzas.

1723
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:20,710
Or do I have to do everything to unlock the final level, the
jail, you know?

1724
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:22,350
Officer Brick, check it out.

1725
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:24,030
Mama wrote me a theme song.

1726
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:29,990
360 degree rotation and I'm still pushing Mongo foot in.

1727
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:32,010
Am I a rad ripper or what?

1728
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:37,190
You can only do the story playing as Pepper, if I remember
correctly.

1729
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:53,650
him way oh because he's the one that get that makes him
break out of jail oh so then maybe we have to redo the story

01:49:53,650 --> 01:50:04,490
as pepper oh I picked the right guy the very first time
that's crazy are you ready to leave Lego Island no oh bless

01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:09,470

1732
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:21,690
Oh my god.

1733
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:25,030
Okay, we're gonna do this then.

1734
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:27,530
First, we're gonna go to the hospital.

1735
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:29,390
And now, you're pepper.

1736
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,310
Welcome to Lego Island.

1737
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:36,510
Because I want to get the red brick with here.

1738
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:37,070
Oh.

1739
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:41,270
You know, and then we can deliver the pizzas.

1740
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,150
This is the run.

1741
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:44,830
This is the run.

1742
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,630
I just needed my skateboard, you know?

1743
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:49,010
Hello, I didn't see you at first.

1744
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:51,570
I see you now, of course, and I'm really glad you're here.

1745
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:52,830
Why is he a chef all of a sudden?

1746
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:54,910
Wait, I thought you weren't...

1747
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,990
Oh, it's because I clicked on him.

1748
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,010
This is bad.

1749
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,930
Very bad.

1750
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:03,790
This is when I was nine years old.

1751
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:05,210
26 years ago.

1752
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:10,130
I could do this.

1753
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:10,330
I could do this.

1754
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:11,590
Yes!

1755
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:13,670
Give me the keys!

1756
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:16,970
Okay, shoot.

1757
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:17,990
Enter and return with you.

1758
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,030
They'll know what to do.

1759
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:20,130
Enter, return.

1760
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:20,850
Come out here.

1761
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:21,990
I need you, Calvin.

1762
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:23,270
Outgoing.

1763
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:25,750
Let's see.

1764
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:26,470
I want to give him.

1765
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:27,470
It's mine.

1766
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:28,770
No, it's mine.

1767
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:31,890
Since when does you wear that color?

1768
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,690
I like the flower head.

1769
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,010
Don't worry.

1770
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:35,810
They'll get it together.

1771
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:36,910
They always do.

1772
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:38,970
Don't forget to take the ambulance head.

1773
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:40,410
The ambulance head.

1774
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:40,990
Right outside.

1775
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:43,090
There we go.

1776
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:45,990
And Peppa, try to go a little easy on the siren boy.

1777
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:46,970
Some of us want to kill him.

1778
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:49,230
Oh, there's a siren?

1779
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:51,850
Be boobie!

1780
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:53,970
Oh, I don't want to see this all over again, please.

1781
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:59,290
Let me quit the cutscene, please.

1782
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:02,150
I like how I can still interact with stuff.

1783
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,810
Caparoni is in Lego Fortnite.

1784
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:17,110
As an NPC in Lego Fortnite is currently celebrating the 15
years of Ninjago.

1785
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:18,830
Oh, my God.

1786
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:21,590
Trying to figure out your shortest route, it doesn't matter
which order.

1787
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,530
Peep.

1788
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:26,430
Someone there will tell you what to do.

1789
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:28,610
All right, to the pizza.

1790
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:32,410
To the pizza.

1791
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:40,690
Some dude's choking.

1792
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:44,670
Quick, do something.

1793
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:46,390
Click on him, somebody.

1794
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:48,010
I'm clicking, I'm clicking.

1795
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:49,770
He's fine.

1796
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:53,330
I love the way he just stops and smiles.

1797
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,830
He's like, I'm choking.

1798
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:57,470
Everybody just is smiley the whole time.

1799
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,010
Why did he eat the whole shark?

1800
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,570
Why did he do that?

1801
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:14,350
The dog sounds so much like a human.

1802
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:25,070
The dog being like, it was a bit.

1803
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:29,970
Well, don't drop him!

1804
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:31,590
You mean like that other guy?

1805
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:33,170
Whatever happened to him.

1806
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,770
Who?

1807
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:35,550
The other guy!

1808
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:37,010
We dropped him!

1809
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:39,530
Well, don't drop him!

1810
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:41,510
Well, don't drop him!

1811
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:41,810
Okay.

1812
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:44,010
To the police station!

1813
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:44,250
Move, move, move!

1814
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:45,590
There's plenty more to do.

1815
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:47,330
If you need me, I'll be on the golf course.

1816
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:47,690
Oh my gosh.

1817
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:48,410
Where is that anyway?

1818
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:50,530
The golf course?

1819
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,010
Sir, is my profession a joke to you?

1820
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:58,130
You're still in time.

1821
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:59,370
No one's falling yet.

1822
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:00,650
Hey, you see that's the way.

1823
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:05,090
I guess we destroyed this leaf or something, but it's been
time for us ever since.

1824
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:11,110
What I need you to do is get your clown boys over there to
hold the stretcher under the roof and catch my partner when

1825
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:11,770
he falls.

1826
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:18,030
I just wish I could cut, uh, skip some of these cutscenes.

1827
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:20,370
All right, there we go.

1828
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:24,830
Do a flip!

1829
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,490
Do a flip!

1830
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:39,030

1832
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:58,390
everybody out they're just like all stacked together.

1833
01:54:59,310 --> 01:54:59,590
Like that.

1834
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:02,150
All my time here, I've never seen such good driving.

1835
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:03,750
Oh, space scissors.

1836
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:05,870
Yay!

1837
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,690
Okay, let's go get my skateboard.

1838
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,930
We'll start delivering some pizzas.

1839
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:16,890
Yeah, we're so slow when we can't.

1840
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:17,850
Okay.

1841
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:20,550
Hopefully that gives us a red brick.

1842
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:22,890
You guys, I'm going to be so honest.

1843
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:25,290
It's so hard keeping my eyes open right now.

1844
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,270
Oh my gosh.

1845
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:34,190

1853
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,560
Oh, we just did it.

1854
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:47,180
I'm free.

1855
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:47,780
Oh!

1856
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:51,120
Oh my gosh, we didn't have to do a bunch of the things.

1857
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:52,380
Look up the word gullible.

1858
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,180
Okay, now we can skip all this.

1859
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,900
Wait, where'd my skateboard go, though?

1860
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:03,760
Okay, we gotta go get it again, I think.

1861
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,700
So we left it at the pizza.

1862
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,220
Okay.

1863
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:11,020
Oh, I thought we would have to redo everything.

1864
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,280
The Brickster's loose!

1865
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,400
The Brickster's loose!

1866
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:16,160
The Brickster's loose!

1867
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,360
He doesn't seem all that concerned.

1868
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:21,540
He sees dead people.

1869
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,880
He says, Vito!

1870
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:25,960
All right.

1871
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,180
Give me my skateboard.

1872
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,640
Guys, it's not here.

1873
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:38,840
Guys, where's my skateboard?

1874
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,920
I think you're on the skateboard.

1875
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,220
No, I'm...

1876
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:53,920
I don't think so because I'm so slow, first of all, but
also...

1877
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,000
You would see my hand if I wanted to...

1878
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,120
If I were on it.

1879
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,880
Is there nothing...

1880
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,140
No, I should just be able to travel with it, no?

1881
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,480
Oh, police station.

1882
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:22,140
No.

1883
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,380
Situation red.

1884
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,580
Situation red.

1885
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:30,820
We have a situation here and it isn't very pretty.

1886
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:31,640
Keep it moving.

1887
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:32,620
Hmm.

1888
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:44,580
I feel like I'm so slow though, that's why I don't have it.

1889
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:56,830
Oh, he's gonna be able to destroy so many buildings when
he's in the hospital.

1890
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:02,990
All right, let me just write out a prescription here for the
Bricksters capture and done.

1891
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:04,170
A prescription?

1892
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,230
Hmm.

1893
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:10,390
The Bricksters lose!

1894
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:12,290
The Bricksters lose!

1895
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:12,470
The Bricksters!

1896
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:13,370
The Bricksters lose!

1897
01:59:15,290 --> 01:59:19,730
Yeah, you're off the skateboard.

1898
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,170
I didn't think I was on.

1899
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,380
The brickster's loose.

1900
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:35,260
Everyone's freaking out, but...

1901
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:38,420
But the island is, like, so tiny.

1902
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,080
We could all gang together and get them, you know?

1903
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,280
Well, at least you got here before too much damage.

I'm so slow.

1910
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,520
He's gonna absorb everything.

1911
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:28,200
Whoa.

1912
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:31,360

Where'd he go?

1920
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:48,220
He's so fast.

1921
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:50,660
I'm too slow.

1922
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:51,940
Did he go up here?

1923
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:55,020
No.

1924
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,410

1925
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,570
Brick?

02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:12,540
Where'd he go?

1928
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:15,920
He went through the tunnel.

1929
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,530
Oh my god.

1930
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:22,690

02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:29,590
Oh, I see him.

1934
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,110
Why can't I have a vehicle?

1935
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:36,430

Don't you do it!

1941
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:00,160
He did it in one go!

1942
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:01,760
Wait!

1943
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,140

02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:09,660
Oh, oh my gosh.

1948
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:10,420
He shoots!

1949
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:11,400
He scores!

1950
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,000
Okay, he's going around.

1951
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,080
He's going around.

1952
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:30,180
Can you just imagine I'm just a kid running through the
town?

1953
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:32,340
Like literally like...

1954
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,720
Huffing and puffing?

1955
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,360
What are the cops doing?

1956
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,340
What are the cops doing?

1957
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:47,000
Maybe you can catch a brick, but you can't catch me.

1958
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:53,140
We're going round the island.

1959
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,800
The Lego Island.

1960
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,060
Don't do it!

1961
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:19,050
I feel like the helicopter is going to be impossible.

1962
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:26,550
Okay, but I know not to shoot so many pieces, I think.

1963
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,640
All right, come on.

1964
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:37,100
Was it just a koiki thing that he went to the...

1965
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:39,380
this time.

1966
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,540
Oh, I'm shaking my bricks now.

1967
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:42,520
Oh, he almost tried.

1968
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:46,060
Hey, Pepper, did you order the brick?

1969
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:48,440
Did he, did I do that?

1970
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:56,870
Did you order the brick?

1971
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:58,970
Where's he going?

1972
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:05,890
Did you order the...

1973
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:07,290
What is he being by that?

1974
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:15,330
Come on, why are we just letting this kid...

1975
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:17,950
Okay.

1976
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,890
This is the last one then.

1977
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:21,950
All right.

1978
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:23,070
Oh, no.

1979
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:23,810
It's begun.

1980
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:24,990
It's begun.

1981
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:26,490
Oh, no.

1982
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,430
Oh.

1983
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:32,190
I'll hide the rest, so I can rest.

1984
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,190
Okay.

1985
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:37,290
Okay.

1986
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:40,270
I'll turn the music down.

1987
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:44,450
Hey, Vito, did you order the...

1988
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:46,230
Don't say it.

1989
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:48,190
All right, whistling time.

1990
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:51,770
Now, though, I know that I can, like, click it from far
away.

1991
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:56,730
I don't have to be right on top of it.

1992
02:04:57,870 --> 02:04:59,590
We still have to, like, get up here.

1993
02:05:00,790 --> 02:05:01,630
What did I order?

1994
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:02,710
What did I order?

1995
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,950
A knuckle sandwich.

1996
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:07,530
Oh, my God.

1997
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:08,490
Out of the way!

1998
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,750
Please.

1999
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:17,410
Oh.

2000
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:19,290
Okay.

2001
02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:21,010
Can I see...

2002
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:23,030
Is there any others that I could see from up here?

2003
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:24,030
Is that one?

2004
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:25,830
Oh, it is.

2005
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:26,470
It was one.

2006
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:27,670
Okay, that's two.

2007
02:05:30,850 --> 02:05:32,990
I think they're in different locations than before.

2008
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:34,250
Out of the way!

2009
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:35,470
Or maybe not.

2010
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:38,190
That one felt like a different location.

2011
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:39,570
But I might be crazy.

2012
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:42,590
Speed run strats.

2013
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:45,530
Absolutely.

2014
02:05:48,230 --> 02:05:48,430
Ah!

2015
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:49,450
out of the way!

2016
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:51,830
Okay, we can't see it from over here.

2017
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:55,050
Uh...

2018
02:05:55,050 --> 02:06:01,850
At least we're not, like, preventing him from absorbing the
building, so...

2019
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:03,410
Is that it?

2020
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:04,390
Oh, it is.

2021
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:06,230
Oh, they are in different spots, then.

2022
02:06:07,450 --> 02:06:08,710
Just a little bit.

2023
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:16,210
Oh, here.

2024
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:20,030
Oh, we did it!

2025
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:21,530
Brilliant soups!

2026
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:34,590
That was quick.

2027
02:06:34,850 --> 02:06:35,870
We're speed running, baby.

2028
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:39,550
Okay.

2029
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,490
Yeah.

2030
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:48,990
Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way, out of the
way.

2031
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:57,650
What's the point of having two different things if I can't
like go back and forth?

2032
02:06:58,190 --> 02:06:58,650
You know?

2033
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,190
It all just goes one way.

2034
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:07,690
This game is silly.

2035
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:08,950
You're silly.

2036
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:10,310
No, this game is really silly.

2037
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:12,730
Smooth jazz town.

2038
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:14,930
Oh gosh, you guys.

2039
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:16,070
I'm nervous here.

2040
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:16,670
I'm nervous.

2041
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:19,750
Shoot donuts at the brick stair.

2042
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:20,410
No.

2043
02:07:20,630 --> 02:07:21,370
That's not right.

2044
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:22,590
Oh, I know.

2045
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:24,510
Pizzas should be aimed at...

2046
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:25,130
At...

2047
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:26,110
The...

2048
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:26,910
I know!

2049
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:28,950
Shoot pizzas at the Brickster!

2050
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:32,750
Donuts at Nick or Laura, and our island is saved!

2051
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:34,030
Good luck!

2052
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:35,110
And one more thing.

2053
02:07:35,450 --> 02:07:36,410
What was that?

2054
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:37,430
Oh, yes!

2055
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:38,330
Hurry!

2056
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:42,850
Oh, Pepper, be careful upstairs!

2057
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,710
Can you hear me, Pepper?

2058
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:46,310
This is Mama!

2059
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:49,390
It sounds like you're chewing a well!

2060
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:51,370
Where's the cop?

2061
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:53,710
Where are they?

2062
02:07:58,110 --> 02:07:59,690
Oh my god.

2063
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:05,390
Where?

2064
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:07,350
Okay, he ate one, I think.

2065
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:08,950
Where are the police?

2066
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:15,370
No!

2067
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:25,210
Which way is he gonna go?

2068
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:29,970
Which way?

2069
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:31,570
Which way?

2070
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:33,430
Oh, there he is.

2071
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:39,520
Where's the police?

2072
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:41,800
No!

2073
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:43,720
Wait, wait, wait!

2074
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:46,720
Wait, wait!

2075
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:48,700
Eat!

2076
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:49,520
Eat!

2077
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:50,380
Eat!

2078
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:52,340
Please!

2079
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,340
Oh my god, please!

2080
02:08:54,360 --> 02:09:01,960
Please, please, please, God, please, God, please, God,
please, please, God, please, please, please, please, please,

2081
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:12,060
please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please, please, please, oh, my God,

2082
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:22,760
oh, my God, oh, my God, please, please, please, please,
please, oh, my God, I just turned my commendation off,

2083
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:27,400
Why?

2084
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:31,580
Please!

2085
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,080
Oh my god, oh my god.

2086
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,400
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

2087
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:37,360
No.

2088
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:45,680
Okay, okay, this might be it, this might be it.

2089
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:46,580
No!

2090
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:51,060
No!

2091
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,420
No!

2092
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:53,400
Not bad, but not good.

2093
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:01,900
I'm going to make it.

2094
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:03,220
I don't think so.

2095
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:05,920
I don't think so.

2096
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,460
Mama, we're not going to make it.

2097
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,120
Please.

2098
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,340
Is this a rage bait game?

2099
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:17,760
I think.

2100
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,420
Is this a rage bait game for real?

2101
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:23,140
Oh my god.

2102
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:23,720
They're going.

2103
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:24,060
They're going.

2104
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:24,340
They're going.

2105
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:24,880
They're going.

2106
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:27,500
No, please.

2107
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,460
Oh my god, please.

2108
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,240
Please, please, God.

2109
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,380
Why did he turn around?

2110
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,820
They don't follow the pizza.

2111
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:44,080
They don't follow the donuts.

2112
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,100
I don't understand.

2113
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:46,980
I don't understand the logic.

2114
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,200
Why did he turn around?

2115
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,280
I don't think there's any way to beat this gift.

2116
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,460
I don't think it's possible!

2117
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:56,300
Hey, Pepper!

2118
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:57,880
It's Matt Lockett here!

2119
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,260
Can you hurry up?

2120
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,400
I'm getting dry rot down here!

2121
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:01,820
Ah!

2122
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,380
Ah!

2123
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:08,940
Ah!

2124
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:10,500
Ah!

2125
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:10,780
Ah!

2126
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:14,420
You have a one in me to remind you not to forget about those
donuts!

2127
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:16,240
Cops get hungry too!

2128
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,180
Oh my god!

2129
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:20,020
Oh my god, please!

2130
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:23,600
The preculator store!

2131
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:24,020
Please!

2132
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:25,720
Eat a donut!

2133
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:31,340
I gotta tell you, this looks kinda funny from down here.

2134
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,460
Like...

2135
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:33,540
Like raining donut.

2136
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:38,740
Seriously?

2137
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,440
It's nonsensical.

2138
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:48,620
I think it's no sense!

2139
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,120
Turn around, please!

2140
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:52,100
Turn around!

2141
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:56,020
There you go.

2142
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:57,560
Now use your head.

2143
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:02,160
Did they just say that I'm now using my head?

2144
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,280
Where's the cop?

2145
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:06,200
They're gone!

2146
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:07,600
We lost!

2147
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:08,420
We lost!

2148
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:10,960
He's just stuck over there for some reason!

2149
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,500
He's just going back and forth!

2150
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,060
What was that?

2151
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:17,320
Was that the break, sir?

2152
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:18,620
Who's that?

2153
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:19,900
Everybody, carry on, son.

2154
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:37,640
I only have limited numbers of donuts and they're not...

2155
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:51,730
I'm doing well, she says.

2156
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:54,990
Everybody, she says I'm doing well.

2157
02:12:57,190 --> 02:13:00,890
I don't know, I seriously...

2158
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,050
I don't know, everybody.

2159
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:03,230
This is...

2160
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,110
It's so over.

2161
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,230
I think the pizza is the last place.

2162
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:10,350
Please, everybody!

2163
02:13:12,330 --> 02:13:13,990
You're looking good, little buddy.

2164
02:13:14,350 --> 02:13:17,590
You're on that brickster like a parrot on a sesame seed
pizza.

2165
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:22,270
Is this possible?

2166
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:26,330
Is this possible?

2167
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:45,440
Well, it's not as bad as it is.

2168
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,140
Oh, the buildings are the dots!

2169
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:56,020
the donuts or the dots you can just start again or come back
later when you want to we'll be able to reconstruct i think

2170
02:13:56,020 --> 02:14:03,000
oh what am i saying but they don't follow them they don't
follow the donuts and they don't follow the pizza island so

2171
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:09,700
start a new game or exit through those doors and come back
when you want to visit again

2172
02:14:14,690 --> 02:14:21,670
spam pizzas and donuts well where i didn't when I was seven.

2173
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:28,960
Spam and make a trail to lead them around.

2174
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,920
Okay, you have to rapidly click spam the donuts.

2175
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:34,020
Okay, holy hell.

2176
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,220
Oh my God, one more try.

2177
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:37,960
Wait, I wanna see my cube.

2178
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:39,980
And now you're Pepper.

2179
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:41,960
Welcome to- Yay!

2180
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:43,520
Okay, it worked.

2181
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:44,460
Okay.

2182
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,260
All right, Pepper.

2183
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,600
And now you're Pepper.

2184
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:50,280
I'm Pepper.

2185
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:01,670
The worst part is following him in the damn ambulance.

2186
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:04,030
Hello?

2187
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:05,710
Okay.

2188
02:15:06,670 --> 02:15:07,270
Take that.

2189
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:08,790
Take that.

2190
02:15:10,330 --> 02:15:10,910
Let Lego.

2191
02:15:11,530 --> 02:15:12,310
Let Lego.

2192
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:14,410
Let Lego.

2193
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:15,550
Let Lego.

2194
02:15:18,370 --> 02:15:19,110
Let le-lego.

2195
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:21,690
Roadblock are not going anywhere.

2196
02:15:22,030 --> 02:15:22,750
Let Lego.

2197
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:23,990
Let Lego.

2198
02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:26,490
Let le-lego.

2199
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:27,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2200
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:29,410
Okay.

2201
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:34,290
Yeah, we have to do it all over again, which is the worst
part.

2202
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:41,490
Skate is only available when he delivers pizza.

2203
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,630
It's the worst!

2204
02:15:43,670 --> 02:15:45,210
It's the actual worst!

2205
02:15:46,610 --> 02:15:47,930
Okay, wait, is he doing it?

2206
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:49,290
Okay, okay, we gotta go.

2207
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:51,650
Dargo, thank you!

2208
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:55,510
Because we're so slow.

2209
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:57,730
Oh my god.

2210
02:15:58,510 --> 02:16:00,170
The Bricksters loose!

2211
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:02,330
The Bricksters loose!

2212
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:03,390
The Bricksters loose!

2213
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,330
The Bricksters loose!

2214
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:12,330
He beats it in like 10 seconds and speed rat?

2215
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:13,230
Speed rat?

2216
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:14,090
Speed rat?

2217
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:15,210
Speed rat strat?

2218
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:19,030
Not the speed rat!

2219
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:24,290
The game rage baited me so hard, I actually woke up.

2220
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:27,730
Like I was truly falling asleep.

2221
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:30,290
And then...

2222
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:32,450
Way to go.

2223
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:34,130
Wait.

2224
02:16:36,310 --> 02:16:38,610
Oh my gosh.

2225
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:45,170
Rage bait game of the year.

2226
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:48,470
It's the mean, mean pizza machine.

2227
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,640
He shoots, he scores!

2228
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:02,240
This part he goes here.

2229
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,300
I remember.

2230
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:07,940
I remember.

2231
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,400
Third time's the charm.

2232
02:17:13,220 --> 02:17:14,320
Pizza makes Brickster slow.

2233
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:16,860
Donut- yeah, they don't guide.

2234
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,100
It's random if they catch him.

2235
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:19,300
Well, okay.

2236
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:20,960
So we just gotta spam it.

2237
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:25,280
You may be able to catch a brick, but you can't catch me.

2238
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:30,480
Hey, Pepper.

2239
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:31,940
Deliver this.

2240
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:39,640
What?

2241
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:40,060
What?

2242
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:41,200
Where did that guy come from?

2243
02:17:43,460 --> 02:17:43,920
Alright.

2244
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:48,060
Okay, so I thought it would lead them, but it doesn't.

2245
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:51,280
So you just gotta make them really fast and him really slow.

2246
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:54,560
But he does, though, what's the word?

2247
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:57,200
He stops eating them after a while.

2248
02:17:58,860 --> 02:17:59,320
Brick?

2249
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:05,780
No wonder I couldn't beat it as a kid if nothing worked
properly on XP.

2250
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:11,680
Some people were invisible and you could only click things
at certain angles.

2251
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:12,740
Oh my god.

2252
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:14,820
Hey, hey, hey!

2253
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:15,100
Whoa!

2254
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,830
I'm shaking my bricks now.

2255
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:23,040
He shoots, he scores!

2256
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,660
Oh, is he heading to the secret area now?

2257
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,580
I think he is.

2258
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:31,000
I think he is.

2259
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:34,120
I think he's heading to the... I think we're gonna hear the
whistle.

2260
02:18:35,060 --> 02:18:35,780
Q whistle.

2261
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:37,440
Coming in high.

2262
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:38,220
Whistle.

2263
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:39,180
Yep, there he is.

2264
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,240
Whistle coming in on three, two, oh.

2265
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,220
Fine.

2266
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:50,860
I'll hide the rest, so I can rest.

2267
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,440
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2268
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:57,300
Alright, here we go.

2269
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:00,060
Why does there have to be one at the very top?

2270
02:19:06,330 --> 02:19:06,790
Alright.

2271
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:09,050
Spam pizza.

2272
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:10,310
Spam donut.

2273
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:12,090
Spam pizza.

2274
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:13,710
Spam donut.

2275
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:14,050
Ooh.

2276
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,790
Spam pizza.

2277
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:17,930
Do it.

2278
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:18,710
Do it.

2279
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:18,930
Do it.

2280
02:19:19,410 --> 02:19:19,790
Do it.

2281
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:19,790
Do it.

2282
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:19,790
Do it.

2283
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:19,810
Do it.

2284
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:19,810
Do it.

2285
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:20,890
Do it.

2286
02:19:21,010 --> 02:19:21,330
I can't.

2287
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:22,050
I can't do it.

2288
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,530
Hey!

2289
02:19:22,790 --> 02:19:24,250
Do your job!

2290
02:19:24,710 --> 02:19:26,010
Please God!

2291
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:34,030
Okay.

2292
02:19:34,030 --> 02:19:38,950
Now from here, you can't see it's kind of randomized in a
way.

2293
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:41,530
The one that was over there is not there now.

2294
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:44,690
There's something in the sky.

2295
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:46,070
Did you see that?

2296
02:19:46,290 --> 02:19:47,890
There's like a little brick in the sky.

2297
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:53,590
Alright, we're gonna have to go back down and find them.

2298
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:54,370
Oh, oops.

2299
02:19:55,390 --> 02:19:56,390
I'm not sorry.

2300
02:19:56,830 --> 02:19:57,910
I will not apologize.

2301
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:03,260
Is there fall damage?

2302
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:04,300
If we could fall.

2303
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:07,940
Unfortunately, we can't even walk on the grass.

2304
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:11,400
We are the most, like...

2305
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:16,020
Great-laced Lego guy ever to ever exist.

2306
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,240
Did I go the wrong way again?

2307
02:20:25,380 --> 02:20:25,840
I think I did.

2308
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:27,220
My bad.

2309
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:31,280
Goodie two bricks.

2310
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:32,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2311
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,180
Never will break the brick law.

2312
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:50,040
I have eyes of a hawk, baby.

2313
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:55,220
I'm guessing the last one is at the police station.

2314
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:06,720
Because I don't hear it.

2315
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,300
Oh, I hear it now.

2316
02:21:14,710 --> 02:21:17,030
He only got part of this building, so does it count?

2317
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:23,280
Oh, wait.

2318
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:23,760
I saw it.

2319
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,160
I saw it.

2320
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:24,580
I saw it.

2321
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:27,820
Isn't that it?

2322
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:30,420
This music.

2323
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:32,820
Yeah.

2324
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,160
Alright.

2325
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,620
Okay, guys.

2326
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:39,260
Okay, guys.

2327
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:40,540
This is it!

2328
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:48,340
We now have the means and a plan to capture that, that, that
poorly constructed brickster.

2329
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:54,080
Pepper, as our best and most proven builder, quickly get to
the police station and build our helicopter.

2330
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:55,380
Okay.

2331
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,700
Shut up.

2332
02:21:57,980 --> 02:21:58,580
Shhh.

2333
02:21:58,840 --> 02:21:59,460
Shhh.

Let me work.

2335
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,760
Let me do my job.

2336
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:07,720
I'm an artist.

2337
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:09,260
Let me do my job.

02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:19,060

2340
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,840
I'd rather call you.

2341
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:46,260
Where's the police?

2342
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:03,780
Krista is going to de-brick, sir.

2343
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:05,740
Where is he?

2344
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:09,620
There you go.

2345
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,380
Oh my god.

2346
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:35,980
Come down here!

2347
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:36,760
Come down here!

2348
02:23:40,930 --> 02:23:41,910
How's it feel?

2349
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:43,330
Come down here!

2350
02:23:44,110 --> 02:23:47,110
Maybe if we can, like, kind of keep him in the same spot,
you know?

2351
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:51,030
Oh my god, please.

2352
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:53,390
Please land.

2353
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,330
No!

2354
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:56,370
No!

2355
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:00,350
No!

2356
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:01,750
No!

2357
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:10,130
He's Zach!

2358
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:10,610
Oh.

2359
02:24:12,390 --> 02:24:13,010
Where'd he go?

2360
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:14,610
Where did he go?

2361
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:17,110
Where'd he go?

2362
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:22,610
I lost him I lost I lost oh there he is

02:24:56,380 --> 02:24:58,000
The Brickster is caught.

2366
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:00,520
The Brickster is caught.

2367
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:06,380
I repeat.

2368
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:10,080
The Brickster is caught.

2369
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:11,980
Harder than Dark Souls, absolutely.

2370
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:19,840
Yeah, haul his ass to jail.

2371
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,880
You and me, we did it.

2372
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,040
We kept it together.

2373
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,260
We are one.

2374
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:29,160
Yeah, I held it together.

2375
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:33,680
We're single choice like you!

2376
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:35,460
I have a few.

2377
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:42,200
And on behalf of the entire island, I wish to congratulate
you.

2378
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:43,360
That's my hoshi.

2379
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:44,740
Great work, beatotaku!

2380
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:45,880
I'm sorry.

2381
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:46,580
Let's see.

2382
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:49,120
Oh, never mind the speech.

2383
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,040
Let the celebration commence!

2384
02:25:58,510 --> 02:26:00,110
Oh my god.

2385
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:02,490
I don't think she likes you doing that.

2386
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:03,350
Oh my god.

2387
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:04,730
Oh that's not safe.

2388
02:26:05,230 --> 02:26:05,990
Oh my god.

2389
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:07,850
You were so locked in for this.

2390
02:26:08,390 --> 02:26:09,290
Thank you, Cleo!

2391
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:21,480
The Brickster is caught.

2392
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:22,920
The Brickster is caught.

2393
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:24,960
Brickster is caught.

2394
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:25,200
Brick!

2395
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:30,740
Pepper!

2396
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:31,560
Pepper!

2397
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:33,360
Minto.

2398
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,320
Brilliant.

2399
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:36,420
Stupendous.

2400
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,260
Clean.

2401
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:39,680
I can't thank you enough.

2402
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,100
You saved us.

2403
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:42,780
That's all I have to say about that.

2404
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:45,060
You're the hero of the day.

2405
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:48,080
I can't think of the words to express our thanks enough.

2406
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:50,240
Accolades upon you.

2407
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:51,960
Three chairs.

2408
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:53,540
Hip, hip, hooray.

2409
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:54,080
Hooray!

2410
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:55,020
No, no, no, no.

2411
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,620
That doesn't express it enough.

2412
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:59,000
How about way to go?

2413
02:26:59,340 --> 02:26:59,660
Ooh.

2414
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:01,200
I know.

2415
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:01,960
Thanks.

2416
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:02,680
Thanks.

2417
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:03,460
Yeah, you're welcome.

2418
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,600
Well, why not go see how well you did at the scorecube wall
while I think of something to say?

2419
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:11,300
Or if you'd like to, play another game.

2420
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:15,620
You know, open the book and- AI for the copter segment is
legitimately brain dead.

2421
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:17,200
Spamming closer did the trick.

2422
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:19,680
And now, oh, where was I?

2423
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,540
Before the world started falling apart.

2424
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:25,180
Oh, I remember the words to say, thank you.

2425
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:27,140
You're a friend.

2426
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:30,120
Ah, ah, pepperminto.

2427
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:31,920
Pepperminto!

2428
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:36,580
Guys, I count that as a win in our books.

2429
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,580
We beat that game fair and square.

2430
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:50,300
I can't believe the fact that everybody else can read the
sign means that they don't let him free.

2431
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:57,660
But little pepper reads pizzazz because he's stupid as hell.

2432
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:04,430
Our little guy is so dumb.

2433
02:28:08,610 --> 02:28:21,050
I got first in racing, first in boating, first in pizza,
first in law enforcement, first in gasoline, first in

2434
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:21,670
hospital.

2435
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:26,270
Like I think we just, we just knocked it out of the park
today.

2436
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:39,890
So with that, it might be a little bit of a shorter stream,
but thank you all for joining me today for uh this absolute

2437
02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:56,130
hellscape of a of a game do we lego island to maybe in the
future can i play that one easily not sure what was in the

2438
02:28:56,130 --> 02:29:03,790
pizza i ate earlier there's no way this game is actually
this trippy it was way crazier than i remembered it that's

2439
02:29:03,790 --> 02:29:11,370
for sure Unfortunately, today's stream is going to be a
little bit shorter because I have some maid cafe.

2440
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:13,750
I will be appearing at Asayoru tonight.

2441
02:29:14,590 --> 02:29:18,230
So, I have a maid cafe appearance that I got to get ready
for.

2442
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:20,450
So, yeah.

And tomorrow as well.

2444
02:29:23,130 --> 02:29:24,650
But, of course, I'm streaming tomorrow, too.

2445
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:26,010
Just kind of doubled up.

2446
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:28,170
Yes, yes.

2447
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:30,710
Thank you for the fun stream.

2448
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:31,370
Thank you!

2449

Thank you for watching.

Thanks for hanging out.

your curiosity a little bit.

2457
02:30:37,650 --> 02:30:38,550
Hope you're having a good day.

2458
02:30:38,730 --> 02:30:39,230
I sure am.

2459
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:41,250
Ever since I saw the Game Awards last night, Ace Combat.

2460
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:42,790

2461

So excited.

2464
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:49,770
It was a fever dream.

2465
02:30:50,190 --> 02:30:51,910
I'm not sure if I was hallucinating.

2466
02:30:52,390 --> 02:30:53,950
Smash Boo feel better.

2467
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:56,550

02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:40,510
So, thank you!

2478
02:31:41,530 --> 02:31:44,690
I have a new respect for the Lego movie after seeing this.

2479
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:48,970
I just want to know...

2480
02:31:50,750 --> 02:31:55,610
What was going on in their brains to create this?

2481
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,550
You know?

2482
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:58,470
Like, what?

2483
02:31:59,410 --> 02:31:59,970
What?

2484
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:02,270
What?

2485
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:09,700
Do we really want to know?

2486
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:17,320
Just, I would like to say just whimsy, a full dosage of
