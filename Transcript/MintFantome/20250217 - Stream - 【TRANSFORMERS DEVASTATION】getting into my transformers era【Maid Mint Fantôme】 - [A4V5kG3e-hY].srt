1
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Transformers!

2
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,370
Transformers!

3
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,030
Hello everybody!

4
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,610
Hello!

5
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,170
Welcome...Tinhead?

6
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,410
Who you calling Tinhead?

7
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,110
Who you calling Tinhead?

8
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,950
Hello, hello, hello!

9
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,910
Minkitron!

10
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
Yeah,

11
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,190
meet those in disguise.

12
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,230
It's time for Optimus Pride!

13
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,610
I love Transformers, like the transforming sound effect.

14
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,870
Teacup!

15
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,930
It's your birthday!

16
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,710
I was wondering if you could sing MGS5 birthday song.

17
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,890
This is my first MGS game.

18
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,010
Please forgive my sins.

19
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,470
Sins of the teacup.

20
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,890
Happy birthday!

21
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,730
Congratulations!

22
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,070
Happy birthday with salutations!

23
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,790
Happy birthday!

24
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,530
May your sky stay blue!

25
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,110
Happy birthday to you!

26
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,810
Happy birthday, Teacup!

27
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,370
Happy birthday!

28
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,710
Thank you for the P!

29
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,730
Hope you have a great birthday.

30
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,770
Mito Minto is a Transformer.

31
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,430
What would I transform into?

32
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,210
I would wanna be a flying type Transformer.

33
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,190
Probably.

34
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,990
Or like a sick bike, maybe.

35
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,150
I probably would be like a tricycle.

36
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,010
Everybody makes fun of poor Trike Mike.

37
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,710
That guy, all he does is transform into a tricycle.

38
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,450
Only babies ride him.

39
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,190
Who invited Trike Mike to the squad?

40
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,510
Who invited that guy?

41
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,550
Cursed Mickey Mouse toaster.

42
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,350
Like Starscream.

43
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,130
You can transform into Metal Gear!

44
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,490
Oh my gosh, so true.

45
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,510
There is a tricycle Transformer toy they sold in the 80s.

46
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,650
No way, seriously?

47
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,210
I foretold the past?

48
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,970
I fore... I saw it.

49
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,250
I saw into the past.

50
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,510
Transformers.

51
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,970
Curious, have you seen the 86 movie?

52
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,150
I have not.

53
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,950
Actually, I don't think I've seen really any of the movies.

54
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,110
Minus like the Michael Bay ones, but those don't count.

55
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,990
Probably.

56
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,850
Though, I will say that Megatron at like the Universal Parks is so funny.

57
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,670
I like watching videos of him because he's just... Actually, I've met him before.

58
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,130
Do a watchalong?

59
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,650
We should!

60
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,470
We should, we should.

61
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,310
I always cry watching the 86 movie.

62
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,490
I've seen Transformers 1.

63
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,710
I talked about that on stream before recently.

64
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,210
I've watched it a couple times now.

65
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,670
And recently I've been watching Transformers Prime.

66
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,430
Because that's free!

67
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,530
On YouTube, if you didn't know.

68
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,970
It's on... You can just watch it.

69
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,950
They have the series.

70
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,210
All the episodes.

71
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,390
On... on... on... on YouTube.

72
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,830
So, yeah, if you're like, oh, I want to watch a show.

73
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,870
Oh my gosh!

74
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,790
I'm not very far into it at all.

75
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,150
Like, I've literally only... I started it!

76
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,930
I like watched the first episode.

77
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,610
And then some family stuff happened.

78
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,250
And then Valentine's, I started working on it.

79
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,830
So I literally just was like...

80
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,170
And then I watched episode 2 last night.

81
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,150
And oh my god!

82
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,150
The... the... the... what's it called?

83
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,270
The Unicron blood stuff and the zombie...

84
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,250
The zombie transform... Oh my gosh, it's so good.

85
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,130
It's so cool.

86
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,290
Mega Mint.

87
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,370
Dark Energon!

88
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,090
Oh my gosh, it's so good.

90
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,330
It's so cool.

91
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,550
Unicron is dope.

92
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,390
But yeah, so I'm like, you know...

93
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,270
This game came out...

94
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,430
I think around the time that I was watching Beast Wars.

95
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,090
So I was like, oh yeah, Transformers!

96
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:32,630
Yeah!

97
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,770
And I never ended up playing it.

98
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,270
I never ended up playing it and...

99
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,670
Now it's delisted.

100
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,410
So... yippee.

101
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,930
Good job, Past Me.

102
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,070
Good job, Past Me.

103
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,350
Actually, I looked it up.

104
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,010
Because I was just like, I know it's delisted.

105
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,410
I looked it up earlier today.

106
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,070
I was like, I wonder how much this costs.

107
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,150
To like, try and get like a physical copy of it.

108
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,590
On Amazon, it's like $200!

109
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,930
For this game!

110
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:07,890
$200!

111
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,650
What the heck?

112
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,940
It's like, it's like trying to get...

113
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,540
Rule of Rose or something.

114
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,900
Craziness.

115
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,020
Crazy, crazy.

116
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,860
The devs of Metal Gear Rising made this game.

117
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,840
That is correct.

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,680
This is a Platinum Games game.

119
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,180
So...

120
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,140
I think though, that this game is a little bit more like...

121
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,780
Devil May Cry?

122
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,340
If I understand correctly.

123
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,760
In terms of like, you run around and then...

124
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,900
People show up and you're like...

125
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,760
So, I have to warn you guys though.

126
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,520
More like Bayonetta.

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Oh, see, I haven't played Bayonetta yet, so...

128
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
But I have to warn you guys today.

129
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,760
Oh my gosh, I did not sleep well.

130
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,280
At all.

131
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,640
And I had to wake up early because I had some early morning haunting stuff to do.

132
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,460
So...

133
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,400
Just heads up.

134
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,160
When I put this on my schedule, I was just like...

135
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,620
Oh, I can probably one stream it.

136
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,340
But we'll just have to see.

137
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh god, I'm already yawning.

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
We'll just have to see.

139
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,520
I had to like, peel myself off a chair.

140
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
I was like, just sitting there.

141
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I was like, okay, I gotta go stream.

142
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,260
I gotta go stream.

143
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,320
So...

144
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah, but if I don't finish it, I'll probably honestly just...

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,020
Play it tomorrow.

146
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,620
We'll see if I wake up from it.

147
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,940
I also have some coal for you.

148
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,630
A lot of the cast from the 80s cartoon reprised their roles for this game.

149
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,290
Really?

150
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:10,150
The most notable exception being Starscream and Wheelie Jack's VA, Chris Slotta, who passed away in 1994.

151
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,150
If you were to become a Transformer, what kind of vehicle would you transform into?

152
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,590
I wanna be like a fighter jet.

153
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,850
That's what I want to be in my soul.

154
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,850
But I feel that I would be...

155
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,830
A shopping cart!

156
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh my gosh, I'd just transform into...

157
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,710
I'd transform into like a Omurice.

158
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,850
With wheels.

159
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,590
What if I could become Metal Gear?

160
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,330
What if I could transform into Metal Gear?

161
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,950
Metal Gear Rex.

162
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,710
As a Canadian, I just need to say...

163
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,750
Beasties.

164
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,470
Beast Wars is my favorite Transformers.

165
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,310
Yes.

166
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,430
I... Oh my gosh.

167
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,830
Megatron in that series made me a Decepticon fan.

168
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,570
100%.

169
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:23,850
So...

170
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,570
So, you know...

171
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,570
It's kind of hard to...

172
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,770
But...

173
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,990
I do love...

174
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,830
I do love the Autobots though.

175
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,210
We're gonna be playing as the Autobots, obviously.

176
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,830
Oh yeah, the Predacons.

177
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,370
Yeah, yeah, the Predacons!

178
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,590
Sorry, I always forget that.

179
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,010
Like, technically...

180
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,830
Like...

181
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,690
Like, aren't the actual Transformer guys...

182
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,110
Like...

183
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,650
An actual Megatron, like, dead in that series.

184
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,230
So good though.

185
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,270
Predacons.

186
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,030
Yeah, Beast Wars is in the future.

187
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,170
I should rewatch it.

188
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,290
But it's hard to find it.

189
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,250
I don't think there's anywhere you can...

190
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,170
Legally watch it, I think.

191
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,390
At the moment.

192
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,510
I watched it on Netflix a long, long time ago.

193
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,450
So...

194
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,950
Like I said, it was like 10 years ago.

195
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,450
About when I...

196
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,610
When I...

197
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,690
It's on Tubi!

198
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,750
YouTube has it?

199
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:29,990
Really?

200
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,610
Okay.

201
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,470
Beast Wars is on Tubi!

202
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,390
Tubi!

203
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,270
It's not on WubWub.

204
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,830
It's not on Woobaloo.

205
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,810
It's not on BlingBong.

206
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,490
You're gonna watch it on Tubi?

207
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,750
That was my birthday yesterday.

208
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,910
Can I get a happy birthday?

209
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,390
Of course!

210
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,950
You can just call me Jellybean.

211
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,910
Jellybean!

212
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,070
Okay, glad.

213
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,790
Because your name actually cuts off.

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,270
So all I could see was...

215
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,270
The asexual.

216
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,150
I couldn't see any other part of your name!

217
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Happy birthday to you!

218
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,780
Happy birthday to you!

219
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,520
Happy birthday dear Jellybean!

220
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,120
Happy birthday to you!

221
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,260
The asexual.

222
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,560
Why

223
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,790
is my controller so warm?

224
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,110
It was against my cup!

225
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,890
Oh my goodness.

226
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,290
It's like, why is my controller so hot?

227
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,370
Oh my god.

228
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,330
You guys have been watching stuff about the new graphics card?

229
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,510
Oh my gosh.

230
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,950
I'm kind of glad I didn't wait for the 5090 or whatever.

231
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,590
Holy moly!

232
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,090
I mean though, I couldn't buy the merch last night unfortunately.

233
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,210
Because it doesn't ship to my country.

234
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,830
No, I'm sorry!

235
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,490
I'm so sorry.

236
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,990
I see so many people saying that it doesn't ship to their country.

237
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,650
And I got help on this one from a different place.

238
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,070
So...

239
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,510
So hopefully in the future...

240
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:33,730
Hopefully in the future I can find a way to expand to more countries.

241
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,950
I'm so sorry.

242
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,790
I'm so, so sorry.

243
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,810
The mugs are all sold out?

244
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,570
No way.

245
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,410
The 5090 has serious wire issues.

246
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,070
Yes, yes, yes!

247
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,370
That's what I've been watching!

248
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,610
I've been watching gamers...

249
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,410
I watch Gamers Nexus and stuff like that.

250
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,010
That channel.

251
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,550
And I've been watching...

252
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,810
I can't remember the guy that I watched.

253
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,190
Last night.

254
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:55,950
But...

255
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,970
He's like...

256
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,630
German?

257
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,790
Some...

258
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,430
I think?

259
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,910
And...

260
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,750
And...

261
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,550
Germa.

262
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,150
No.

263
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,850
I could not tell you the name.

264
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,030
But he was like getting out like a...

265
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,410
What's it called?

266
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,350
Oh my gosh.

267
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,530
A...

268
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,250
A thermometer.

269
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,610
And he was like...

270
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,560
He was like...

271
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,750
Filming the...

272
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,210
The wires and stuff with the thermometer.

273
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,620
And showing how hot...

274
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,210
Just one wire...

275
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,690
Like the power distribution is all crazy!

276
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,090
It's so...

277
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,070
I was just like...

278
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,550
Oh my goodness.

279
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,470
Why did I think of that?

280
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,390
What made me think of that?

281
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,830
I don't remember.

282
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,830
I don't know why I brought that up.

283
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,590
Oh, my hot controller!

284
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,650
Yes, thank you.

285
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,410
Oh my goodness.

287
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,870
Thank you.

288
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,410
Sorry.

289
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,330
Like I said, you guys.

290
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,490
My brain is a little bit mushy.

291
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,350
But yeah, the power distribution for the wires just doesn't seem very...

292
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,530
Great.

293
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,210
And...

294
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,030
It could...

295
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,470
Potentially...

296
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,310
Ruin your...

297
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,610
It could burn your...

298
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,690
Your graphics card.

299
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,590
But, you know.

300
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,710
So, I'm glad that I didn't even attempt.

301
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,270
Not that I don't...

302
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,950
I don't think I would have been able to get one anyway.

303
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,050
I am Mint Frantum and I send this message to any surviving ghost taking refuge among the afterlife.

304
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,710
We are here.

305
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,810
We are waiting.

306
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:45,950
We are waiting.

307
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,020
Can we get your best Megatron?

308
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,910
Oh, wait.

309
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,810
Give my best Megatron...

310
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,670
Yes.

311
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,210
Yes.

312
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,050
Yes.

313
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,250
Yes.

314
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,150
No.

315
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,950
Yes.

316
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,270
Yes.

317
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,770
Pretty good?

318
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,110
Perfect?

319
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,190
Perfect?

320
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,250
Will you be playing the new Yakuza pirate game?

321
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,270
Good luck with the games today.

322
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:18,950
Thank you.

323
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,130
I...

324
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,270
I don't know because I've never played any of the other Yakuza.

325
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,110
So, I don't know if it's something that I...

326
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,530
Could play.

327
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,070
It seems pretty like a...

328
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,250
Like a...

329
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,610
Off...

330
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,430
Set of games.

331
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,670
So...

332
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,770
It seems like maybe it doesn't have a lot of stuff.

333
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,610
Like...

334
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,070
Rather...

335
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,230
Like it's not a mainline game.

336
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,650
So...

337
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,560
I know.

338
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,980
You guys don't need to tell me twice to play Yakuza.

339
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,860
You don't need to tell me twice.

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,420
I've been really wanting to play it.

341
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,460
The only...

342
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,620
I actually brought this up on stream before.

343
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,320
Is...

344
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,300
You know, I was just like...

345
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,400
I really want to play Yakuza.

346
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,320
But so many other VTubers have played it recently.

347
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,540
That I feel that maybe there is a bit of a...

348
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,780
What's the word?

349
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,980
Like a fatigue.

350
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,260
About it.

351
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,380
So I'm thinking maybe...

352
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,500
In the future.

353
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,320
Like give it some time to kind of...

354
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,960
Have people be like...

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Oh, I'm kind of pining for some more Yakuza.

356
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,440
It's like, you know, Yakuza...

357
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,800
I think it feels so saturated.

358
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,040
Because it's like such a long game.

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,300
It's a long series and a long game.

360
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,080
Like each one.

361
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,100
So it's kind of like...

362
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,080
You see so...

363
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,940
Even though it's not everybody playing it, right?

364
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,860
But...

365
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,200
You see it so often come into your timeline maybe.

366
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
Depending on who you follow or something.

367
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,760
You know what I mean?

368
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,040
So...

369
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
That's kind of where I'm at.

370
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,300
But after...

371
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,700
Devil May Cry, I'll be...

372
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,060
After Devil May Cry is I'm doing Ace Combat.

373
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:06,960
So...

374
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
And then...

375
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,500
After Ace Combat, we'll probably go...

376
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,060
Maybe then I can at least do one Yakuza game.

377
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,740
I felt that with FF7 Rebirth.

378
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,980
I mean like for me...

379
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,260
I think it really just depends.

380
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,400
For me, I get so excited to see anyone playing Metal Gear.

381
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,120
But I can understand from a viewer's point of view.

382
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,060
If you are not interested in Metal Gear...

383
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,760
It would be like...

384
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,380
Everybody...

385
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,220
There are so many people playing Metal Gear.

386
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,040
I don't care.

387
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,300
Where am I?

388
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,820
I want to just watch something.

389
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,500
So...

390
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,080
Everyone loves Metal Gear.

391
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
I love Metal Gear.

392
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,300
I made my birthday with yesterday.

393
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,720
Ender Preston, happy birthday!

394
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,640
Happy birthday to you.

395
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,960
Happy birthday to you.

396
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,020
Happy birthday Ender Preston.

397
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,100
Happy birthday to you.

398
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,740
Happy birthday!

399
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,180
So I try to like...

400
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,560
You know, I don't want to...

401
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,020
I don't want to burn anybody out on...

402
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,540
On games, you know?

403
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,900
Alan Wake?

404
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,940
Yes, I have that.

405
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,540
I have been wanting to play that.

406
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,840
Especially because I want to play two.

407
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,800
Maybe we can...

408
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,840
That's only two games.

409
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
Maybe we can start that soon.

410
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,240
Reminds me so much of the original Xbox 360 and its overheating issues.

411
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,240
I had one that literally melted the aftermarket fans.

412
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,980
That you could plug in the back.

413
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,520
The plug was melted in the power cable.

414
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,760
That's so scary.

415
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,020
I worry so much because...

416
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,160
Like, you know...

417
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,400
That's kind of like such a big fear of mine.

418
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,520
Even though I'm a ghost, I'm a collector.

419
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,500
And...

420
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,200
Some things I collect are more dead than me.

421
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,300
You know?

422
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,200
And so, if I...

423
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,260
You know, if there was to be like some sort of fire issue...

424
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,660
It's one of my biggest fears ever.

425
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,100
So scary.

426
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,520
So be safe, everybody.

427
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,660
I hope that if you...

428
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,060
Did get one of the new graphics...

429
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,960
If you're one of the ten people that got one of the new graphics cards...

430
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,700
You...

431
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,120
You...

432
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,000
You...

433
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Have no issues.

434
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,120
So...

435
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,880
I don't know why people keep recommending it to me.

436
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,920
It doesn't sound like...

437
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,120
It sounds so lame.

438
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,000
Bad.

439
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,060
Wow.

440
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
I saw someone say earlier too.

441
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,900
I think it was a super chat that...

442
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,380
What?

443
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,280
Like Xenomorph?

444
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm not like...

445
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,880
You know, I don't know everything about computers, but I try to at least...

446
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,920
You know, this is...

447
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I mean, having a computer is part of my job.

448
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,280
So I try to stay updated on stuff.

449
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,480
Predator, not Xenomorph.

450
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,140
Sorry, sorry.

451
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,710
Anyway, I'd add control with Alan Wake.

452
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,990
All of Remedy Games are connected, but these two are a little more connected.

453
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,690
Okay.

454
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,670
I'll try to remember that.

455
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,810
The only downside for this game is that you can't play as any of the fembots.

456
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,350
No!

457
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,060
No!

458
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm so excited.

459
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,360
You know, we might...

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,780
I don't know.

461
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,940
I know that this...

462
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,460
I think this game...

463
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,600
is pretty short.

464
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,380
But there are like side missions from what I remember.

465
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,900
So...

466
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,400
I don't know.

467
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,140
We'll see what happens.

468
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,840
We'll see what we do.

469
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,280
Story mode, obviously.

470
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,780
Commander!

471
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,940
I remember movies because of Megan Fox.

472
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,020
I did not watch because of Megan Fox.

473
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,120
I watched because of the Transformers.

474
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,120
We are two different types of horny.

475
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,220
I am horny for the robots.

476
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,700
I think you are horny for the women.

477
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,590
Not that I'm not too, but...

478
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,420
We are not the same.

479
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,720
For me, I think robots...

480
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,820
Robots maybe sometimes dominate the women.

481
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,540
Well, I wish they would.

482
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,440
But you know what I mean.

483
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,080
Let's say we are ranking.

484
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,180
Like, robot women are probably at my very...

485
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
I love...

486
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,180
Okay, guys.

487
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,430
I don't think...

488
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,330
Okay, have you guys ever watched Fireball?

489
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,110
Fireball is this...

490
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,130
I'll say old now.

491
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,970
It's pretty old now.

492
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,410
But it's an old Disney animated short series...

493
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,250
That features this robot girl named Drossel.

494
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,330
Look her up...

495
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,590
And you will understand 100% my type of robot girl.

496
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,410
And it's so funny because...

497
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,850
I went to a convention not too long ago.

498
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,730
I say that.

499
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,450
Actually, it was...

500
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,790
Maybe a couple of years ago now.

501
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,170
But there was a table selling doujinshi.

502
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,010
And I was just like looking through.

503
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,790
I was browsing.

504
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,910
I was like...

505
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,370
And then I see one.

506
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,450
And I was like...

507
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,990
This robot looks so much like Drossel.

508
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,350
And the guy that was manning the booth...

509
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,550
He was just like...

510
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,090
You know who Drossel is?

511
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,910
And I was like...

512
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,650
I know who Drossel is.

513
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,850
Nobody knows who Drossel is.

514
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,330
Oh my gosh.

515
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,210
Yes, Jenny.

516
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,710
XJ9 from Teenage Robot.

517
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,590
She was one of my...

518
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,650
She was one of my first crushes.

519
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,710
I love her.

520
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,350
Oh my god.

521
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,430
Her?

522
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,770
Drossel?

523
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,010
They're so perfect.

524
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,210
Yes!

525
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,680
She looked like Miku a little.

526
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,660
True, yeah.

527
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,840
I love robot girls.

528
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,380
I don't think I can express that enough.

529
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,780
But the doujin that I bought...

530
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,140
The guy was just like...

531
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,440
Yeah, actually...

532
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
This artist loves Fireball.

533
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,860
Loves Drossel.

534
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,460
And so that's why he based these characters kind of off of her design.

535
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,960
I joined in on an interesting conversation.

536
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,260
It's all related.

537
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
This is all robots.

538
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,260
Thoughts on Dorothy from Big O.

539
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,000
I love Dorothy.

540
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,800
I mean, she's very human, but she's...

541
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,860
You know, humanoid.

542
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,640
But she's so, so cute.

543
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,440
Oh, she's so cute.

544
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,440
Grew up during G1.

545
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,940
This game was a nostalgia trip.

546
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,540
Platinum Games knocked it out of the park.

547
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,480
Platinum Games...

548
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,600
I feel has a good track record.

549
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,660
You can correct me if I'm wrong though.

550
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,890
I'm glad we are in good company.

551
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,450
I'm glad we are in good company that we like robots.

552
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,510
They are cute and also hot.

553
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,790
They are cool and cute and hot.

554
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,710
Oh,

555
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,990
controversial opinion, really?

556
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,470
Blackarachnia.

557
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,310
They lost everyone lately.

558
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,750
No way, seriously.

559
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,710
Oh no.

560
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,170
They turned out so many licensed games.

561
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,890
Not many of them were as good as this one.

562
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,730
That's understandable.

563
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,730
That's understandable.

564
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,790
I guess maybe because I'm like...

565
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,190
Bayonetta.

566
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,610
Metal Gear Rising.

567
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,830
Apparently, this is really good.

568
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,090
So, I'm like...

569
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,810
Okay, Platinum.

570
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:23,490
Okay.

571
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,710
They sucked a lot recently.

572
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,350
No.

573
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,310
That's like one of the worst things, right?

574
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,030
When your...

575
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,730
When like a...

576
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,470
Company...

577
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,870
Lives long enough to become the villain.

578
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,450
Kind of...

579
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,530
Idea, you know?

580
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,290
Where it's just like...

581
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,650
If only they could just put out something like they did before.

582
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:48,790
Anyway.

583
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,310
Okay, I've yapped for 30 minutes now.

584
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,290
I'm kind of...

585
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,270
Oh, guys.

586
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,950
I don't know.

587
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,030
I don't usually play easy mode, though.

588
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,090
But I'm so seepy today that I'm feeling like maybe I should.

589
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,290
Especially if it's like a...

590
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,250
I don't know.

591
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,650
Do you think I would be okay with Warrior?

592
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,490
I think I would be okay with a Warrior.

593
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,350
The Eepers.

594
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,050
I am so eepy seepy today.

595
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,640
You're a...

596
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,420
Lowish?

597
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm a loser?

598
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,440
I'm a Louise?

599
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,320
What?

600
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,440
Blackarachnia did reveal to me I have a type.

601
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,860
Go with Warrior.

602
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Go for Scout.

603
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,580
It's about the action anyway.

604
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,180
Easy mode is fine.

605
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,000
I think...

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,980
You guys know me.

607
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,140
Usually I would play on normal mode.

608
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,480
But I think today I just can't do it.

609
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,060
I'm sorry.

610
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm weak.

611
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm weak.

612
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm weak.

613
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,340
So, you can flame me in the comments.

614
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,820
It's okay.

615
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,020
It's okay.

616
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,100
I give you the allowance.

617
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,940
Say, this ghost played on easy mode.

618
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,400
Not a gamer.

619
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,740
Wow.

620
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,480
New York!

621
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,780
Oh no!

622
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,240
I would love you even if you were a Worm Bot.

623
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,900
I hope people weren't in those cars.

624
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,020
Insecticons?

625
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
I love...

626
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,320
As soon as Starscream starts talking you know it's him.

627
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,340
Oh yeah!

628
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,500
Constructicons!

629
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,020
Starscream...

630
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,780
Soundwave the goat.

631
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,300
Get that sweet, sweet Energon.

632
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,660
That's me in the back!

633
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,580
lol

634
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,400
Also sorry, I don't know all their names or anything like that so...

635
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,900
Please forgive me.

636
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,440
Deceptichops.

637
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,300
Yeah!

638
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,480
It's a really empty building.

639
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,120
The pain and the fear.

640
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,360
No way!

641
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,220
Autobots, I'm fine.

642
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,460
Autobots, I'm good.

643
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm good.

644
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,480
Move character, rotate camera.

645
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,080
Wow!

646
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,460
It looks so cool!

647
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,140
Oh my gosh.

648
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,620
Autobots, I'm good.

649
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,620
I'm gonna start...I'm gonna start referring to you guys like...

650
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm gonna start being like...

651
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,420
Wisps, I'm good.

652
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:00,780
Lift!

653
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,700
Lift?

654
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,320
Let's jump.

655
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,660
That's not throw.

656
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,880
Lift and throw!

657
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,340
That's not throw.

658
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:10,900
Throw!

659
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,500
Wait, lift?

660
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,060
Oh my gosh, yeah let's go.

661
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,460
Wheeljack, come in.

662
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,500
Is this Cybertronian technology?

663
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,280
I think so, Optimus.

664
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,420
They're creating hurricane force winds like they're trying to sweep the city clear.

665
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,680
Whatever their purpose, there is more to the situation than meets the eye.

666
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,660
Sorry.

667
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,840
I'm not gonna be this obnoxious, don't worry.

668
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:46,900
Sorry.

669
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,420
He said the thing!

670
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:51,960
Oh, whoops.

671
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,580
Lift and destroy!

672
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,020
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

673
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,840
What else can I destroy?

674
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,440
Oh, okay.

675
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,640
Nice.

676
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,240
And then this is...

677
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,580
Okay, circle does nothing by itself.

678
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,760
So it's like an interact kind of button.

679
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,480
I really like cute girl characters who are cocky, pathetic, silly losers.

680
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,100
Despite being a straight man, I love Starscream for those same reasons.

681
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,560
Understandable.

682
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,440
Oh, indestructible tree.

683
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,420
Oh, just kidding.

684
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,640
Can I destroy the cars too?

685
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,800
Oh, Starscream.

686
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,960
Always trying to one-up Megatron.

687
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,600
He's such like a...

688
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,700
He's such a weasel.

689
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,030
Oh my gosh!

690
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,120
Oh, they're tiny.

691
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,440
Okay.

692
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,140
Oh, R1.

693
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,140
Vehicle attack.

694
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,300
What's square?

695
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,660
Square?

696
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,460
Square?

697
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,020
Square?

698
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,380
Oh, hey!

699
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:20,980
Square?

700
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,380
Square?

701
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:21,860
Square?

702
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,220
Square?

703
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,280
When you see a blue flash during a combo, quickly press R1 to perform a devastating vehicle attack.

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,380
Oh, there's more of them?

705
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,020
Uh...

706
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh,

707
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,580
square?

708
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,560
Square?

709
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,940
They're looking different.

710
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,520
That's gonna be me one day.

711
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Seeker.

712
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,900
They're so cool.

713
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,720
How do I shoot from them?

714
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,100
Oh, L2?

715
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,260
Oh.

716
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,020
Oh my gosh.

717
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,120
Oh no!

718
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,740
I'm out!

719
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,940
I think I get more...

720
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,460
I think I'm out of stuff.

721
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,240
Oh, he's dead.

722
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,240
Hello!

723
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,900
Oh, he's dead too.

724
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,220
I'm not doing anything, am I?

725
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,620
Yeah!

726
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,180
You guys can't see my rank, but I got an M for Minto.

727
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,980
One shall... One shall stand.

728
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,180
One shall fall.

729
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,920
While ground troops are created just for this game, their design are based off of Decepticon twins, Runabout and Runamuck from the original cartoon.

730
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,300
Collect Energon cubes to restore your energy.

731
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,200
Green cubes will restore health, while blue cubes will restore your weapon's energy.

732
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:11,880
I see.

733
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
I don't...

734
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,660
Who am I fighting with?

735
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,720
Who are you?

736
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,500
Who are you?

737
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,240
Oh,

738
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,040
now that's how you throw.

739
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,900
Look at that.

740
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,380
Now we learn.

741
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,800
Side swipe.

742
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,540
Oh, thank you.

743
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
Toss down.

744
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,040
Hit.

745
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,400
OK.

746
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,100
Set down.

747
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,540
You go on ahead.

748
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:47,540
OK.

749
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,480
See ya.

750
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,040
Oh, what's this?

751
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,180
Energon cubes.

752
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,340
Attack this Kion barrier repeatedly in a short time to destroy it.

753
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,620
Then you may proceed.

754
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, what?

755
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,860
I did it anyway.

756
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,560
MintoCharm, would you describe us as having the touch and the power or that we dare to be stupid?

757
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,540
I don't understand this reference.

758
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,940
Probably dare to be stupid.

759
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,420
We're all a little stupid, right?

760
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,540
What's this thing?

761
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,220
Can I throw something at it?

762
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,400
Throw!

763
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,890
Come on, Optimus.

764
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,610
Don't miss.

765
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,530
I give up.

766
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,070
Is that Bumblebee?

767
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,550
You know what?

768
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,330
Whatever works.

769
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:07,870
Bumblebee!

770
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,590
Hold R1 to switch between robot and vehicle modes.

771
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,150
Also he talks.

772
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,790
I can't believe you are playing this.

773
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,690
The music on the boss fights is absolute fire.

774
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,650
Go Minto Prime!

775
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,910
Oops, sorry.

776
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,170
Sorry.

777
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,030
Sorry.

778
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:40,650
Hold on.

779
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,150
Sorry.

780
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,170
Wait, hold on.

781
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,370
I can't stop.

782
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,730
I can't stop drifting.

783
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:45,770
Help!

784
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,070
Give me help!

785
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,410
Help!

786
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,330
I can't stop!

787
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,130
I can't stop drifting!

788
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,220
Oh my god.

789
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,060
What is this?

790
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:21,880
After jumping in robot mode, you can change form midair to perform a ground slam that will damage enemies and unearth buried items.

791
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,990
Now I can't do it.

792
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,690
I did it!

793
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,810
Thank you.

794
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,130
Thanks Bumblebee.

795
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,110
Nothing beats a ground pound.

796
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,070
True.

797
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,540
That's what that...

798
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,360
First try.

799
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,140
Met Michael Bell, VA for Sideswipe at a con years ago and he hinted at being involved in this game before it had even been announced.

800
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,040
It was quite a treat to hear many of the original VAs back again.

801
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,740
I bet this is such a great nostalgia trip for so many people.

802
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,180
How do I use the different weapons?

803
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,960
Wait!

804
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,300
Can I go back?

805
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,500
No!

806
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,920
I didn't realize I needed to hit this thing earlier.

807
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,980
Search?

808
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Hit this trans-spatial converter to materialize and hit an item.

809
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,340
Dang.

810
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,820
Oh well.

811
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,740
Hello.

812
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,480
Dodge using R1 just before an enemy attacks with it.

813
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,840
Focus state and briefly slow down time.

814
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,760
First donut!

815
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,780
Thank you!

816
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,120
I haven't watched the 1986 Transformers movie yet.

817
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,640
We'll do a watch along though.

818
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,260
Maybe I should have done that before this stream.

819
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,440
What we could do is if I...

820
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,420
Is if I don't finish today...

821
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,520
We could...

822
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,180
Holy shit.

823
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,420
Oh shoot.

824
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,060
I didn't dodge soon enough.

825
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,760
Dodge!

826
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,520
Vehicle attack!

827
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,560
You're welcome.

828
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,120
Vehicle attack!

829
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,500
I know he's already dead but...

830
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,080
Warning!

831
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,090
We got him.

832
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,560
What are you doing?

833
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,860
That's not what I meant to do.

834
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,220
I meant to do this.

835
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,320
How do I... Oh, here we go.

836
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,760
And you too.

837
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,720
I got it.

838
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,540
I can't aim.

839
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,660
I'm out again?

840
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,490
Can I get up there?

841
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,130
Oh, I can probably from here.

842
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,070
New figures based on it are coming out this year.

843
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,590
Seriously?

844
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,030
My timing is impeccable.

845
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,870
What's L3R3?

846
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,150
That's new.

847
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,690
Dodge.

848
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,380
I'm all charged up and I don't know what...

849
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,130
What?

850
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,650
Oh, sorry.

851
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:26,670
Where?

852
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:27,890
Where?

853
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,230
No, no, no, no.

854
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,050
You

855
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,730
need fire for that.

856
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,070
Shoot it?

857
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,170
But I'm out.

858
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,650
It's my birthday tomorrow but I'll be VOD gang for the next few weeks.

859
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,470
And I was hoping you could try singing in a southern bell accent.

860
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,510
I can try.

861
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,670
Will it be good?

862
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,710
That's a different question, but I can attempt.

863
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,750
Happy birthday to you.

864
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,850
Happy birthday to you.

865
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,350
Happy birthday, Liquid Toast.

866
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,470
Happy birthday and come back soon.

867
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,570
Happy birthday!

868
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,090
No!

869
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,390
Oh my God.

870
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,350
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away.

871
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,410
Grab!

872
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,050
Oh, grab.

873
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,810
Underdog!

874
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:06,850
Grab Underdog.

875
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,270
Grab Underdog.

876
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:10,670
OK.

877
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:11,450
You know what?

878
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:11,830
That works.

879
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,730
Shoot.

880
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,270
I dodged.

881
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,800
I wonder...

882
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:31,820
Nice!

883
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,800
Not this time.

884
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,140
I'm out.

885
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,060
Shoot.

886
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,820
Can I...

887
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,730
I wish I could like... Maybe I could just attack his feet.

888
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,220
I'm dodging.

889
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,360
I'm attacking your feet.

890
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,440
I'm attacking your feet.

891
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,700
Get your toes.

892
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,240
Oh no!

893
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,480
Don't say that.

894
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,980
Don't say that.

895
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,520
Don't say that.

896
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,800
I still have like...

897
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,560
Ah, shoot.

898
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,220
What was that?

899
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,520
This one.

900
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,100
Finishing attack!

901
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,820
Nice.

902
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,460
It's so cool.

903
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,700
A bumblebee!

904
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,300
When did this happen?

905
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,200
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

906
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,640
I'm punching.

907
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,620
Oh, he's got... He is.

908
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,700
Wait, what's his...

909
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,140
Oh, whoops.

910
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,060
Game

911
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,070
owns!

912
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,550
Oh my god!

913
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,160
What's so great is they move so smoothly.

914
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,340
They move so smoothly.

915
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,220
Like the transformation and everything.

916
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,260
Like it feels so natural.

917
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,280
God!

918
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:50,840
Wow!

919
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,760
Can I handle this one yet?

920
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,380
What am I doing wrong?

921
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,380
He's gonna bumbleblast.

922
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,840
Is this also... Oh yeah, he also.

923
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,160
I wasted it.

924
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,160
Oh well.

925
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,360
Take them out how?

926
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,220
How do you want me to what what?

927
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,500
Find cover and take them out?

928
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,740
Oh, change weapon is this.

929
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh, now they tell me.

930
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,880
This one maybe?

931
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,840
Oh, ok, ok.

932
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,080
It's hard to control that.

933
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,060
Wow, I got an A!

934
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,320
Wait, so...

935
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,660
What else we got?

936
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,580
Basic machine gun, Bumblebee's gloves.

937
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,240
How do I change my...

938
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
Wait, where is it?

939
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,710
We got it.

940
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,080
Let's go to other inventories.

941
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,920
Autobots, roll out!

942
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,880
I love the transform sound.

943
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,260
What the heck is this?

944
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,760
Pick up.

945
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,320
Oh, Kremzeek!

946
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,700
I unlocked new stage art.

947
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,480
Kremzeek!

948
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,290
Cyber form.

949
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,510
I keep hitting the wrong thing.

950
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,510
Where is that?

951
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,010
And then...

952
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:15,730
Got it.

953
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,430
Ranged Uncommon.

954
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,550
Should I go this way?

955
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,490
I know it tells me to go this way, but what's over here?

956
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,250
I love exploring in games.

957
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,250
Have you seen Transformers 1?

958
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:31,950
I have!

959
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,170
Ah!

960
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,690
I think I made a mistake.

961
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,090
Where was I coming from?

962
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,290
Nevermind, just kidding.

963
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,500
Sniper wolf.

964
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,780
I see, I see what I need to do.

965
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,280
I'm still trying to get used to the controls.

966
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,840
There is no way this way.

967
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:12,840
Just kidding.

968
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,360
Holy moly, fast.

969
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,350
So I do need to...

970
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,270
We

971
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,900
made it.

972
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,720
Ouch.

973
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,950
Oh gosh, oh my god, oh my god, he's so fast.

974
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,680
I tried, I tried to move.

975
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,480
Ok, it's always like the same spot as it seems.

976
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,500
I tried dodging, I did.

977
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:28,540
I did.

978
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,460
I see, I'm too slow though.

979
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,110
Ok, I'm too slow.

980
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,150
Or rather, I was fast that one time.

981
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,230
Ok, that seems to be our ramp.

982
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,910
Is there anything else over here?

983
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,870
Oh, we cannot go this way yet.

984
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,550
Too windy.

985
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,590
Too windy.

986
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,950
I think we can take it.

987
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,210
Who pays for the damages?

988
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:19,550
The citizens?

989
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,630
The autobots?

990
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,070
How do they explain this to the citizens?

991
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,490
Yeah, sorry for the mess.

992
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,390
Oh shoot.

993
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,870
Sorry for the mess everybody.

994
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,430
I'm looking for hidden collectibles.

995
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,720
Mystery object.

996
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:08,690
Megatron!

997
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:12,990
Megatron!

998
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,250
What is the meaning of this?

999
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,250
Optimus!

1000
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,310
Come to save the day, I presume?

1001
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,550
I am here to stop you from destroying the city.

1002
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,630
Stop me!

1003
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,710
Oh Prime!

1004
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,310
You have no idea what you're really up against, do you?

1005
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,690
Who is really behind this?

1006
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:36,690
What?

1007
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,190
This is our home now, Megatron.

1008
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,170
We should respect it.

1009
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,710
No matter, Prime.

1010
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,030
I have no interest in destroying Earth.

1011
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:52,610
But I'm not opposed to making a few, shall we say, improvements.

1012
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,490
Follow me.

1013
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,790
You've got to break through Megatron's shield.

1014
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:06,290
To perform a rush attack, reach max speed in vehicle mode and use the melee attack button.

1015
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,290
How do I...

1016
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,610
We're driving, we're driving.

1017
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,050
Not

1018
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:20,650
enough!

1019
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,830
How do I know if I'm going max speed?

1020
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,390
How do I know?

1021
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:28,710
Optimus!

1022
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,730
Optimus, how do I know?

1023
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,390
That's not enough!

1024
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:43,970
I think we did it.

1025
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,730
Oh my god!

1026
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,150
Oh

1027
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,760
my...

1028
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Max speed!

1029
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,520
Max speed!

1030
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,760
Max speed!

1031
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,200
Max speed!

1032
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,680
Max speed!

1033
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,800
We dodge that like a gamer, true pro.

1034
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:26,910
Oh gosh!

1035
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,310
He hits so hard.

1036
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,130
Ouchie ouch!

1037
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,630
Oh my god!

1038
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,350
Oh my god!

1039
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,210
Where are you?

1040
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,660
That was my fault.

1041
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,340
I pressed circle instead of square.

1042
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,640
I'm an idiot.

1043
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,840
Couldn't get me this time!

1044
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,760
Couldn't get me this time!

1045
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,540
That was so close!

1046
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,390
That's my next trick.

1047
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,430
Taking out the trash!

1048
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:26,310
Yeah!

1049
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,120
Like I said, it feels so smooth to transform and everything.

1050
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,040
He's talking to me!

1051
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,160
Me!

1052
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,920
Move out!

1053
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,800
He's talking to me!

1054
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,420
Megatron and Soundwave are voiced by the OG.

1055
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1056
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,360
That's what people were saying a lot of the OG people came back.

1057
00:59:59,240 --> 00:59:59,720
Okay.

1058
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,160
What is this?

1059
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,580
Oh gosh, I'm not as fast as Bumblebee was.

1060
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,800
Oh my god!

1061
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,340
I don't think I got all of them!

1062
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,860
Where did it unlock?

1063
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,540
Up there!

1064
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,120
I see it.

1065
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,640
Bumblebee was so easy to maneuver.

1066
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,480
Yay!

1067
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,900
What weapons do we have?

1068
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,640
Flare gun!

1069
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,860
Basic missiles.

1070
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,100
Flare gun.

1071
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,290
Thank you guys for all the superchats!

1072
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:14,330
Sorry, this is a tricky type of game too.

1073
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:20,490
Come to see them, because I'm like running around and doing so much stuff.

1074
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,090
So I apologize.

1075
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,510
Sushi!

1076
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:28,730
Oh my god!

1077
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:29,970
Starscream!

1078
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,530
I didn't realize the superchat was from Starscream.

1079
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,290
What the?

1080
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,690
What do you mean failure?

1081
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,950
Maybe I need to be a basic missile.

1082
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,210
Nope.

1083
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,330
Do I need to drive through?

1084
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,230
Car mode didn't work either you guys!

1085
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,890
Everybody sounds so confident.

1086
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,690
Do I need to...

1087
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,470
Am I just going the wrong way?

1088
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:21,930
Maybe I need to go this way.

1089
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,650
No, that's not...

1090
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:28,810
The max speed...

1091
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,010
Let's try that.

1092
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,750
I'll do a little lap.

1093
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,270
Our engines...

1094
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,150
Thanks Optimus!

1095
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:37,510
See ya!

1096
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,090
Ok!

1097
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:49,870
Thank you!

1098
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,750
Jump!

1099
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:55,570
Nice!

1100
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,950
Did I get everything?

1101
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,910
Can I jump again?

1102
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:00,210
Jump!

1103
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,490
My depth perception...

1104
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,110
It even... Come on!

1105
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,310
Just drop.

1106
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,590
Maybe I need to do it again here too.

1107
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,160
Nice!

1108
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,060
Ok, so if it's that kind of...

1109
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,120
So we're heading that way.

1110
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,460
We can't go that way, but...

1111
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,380
Nothing there.

1112
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,140
We're here!

1113
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,090
How's the volume by the way?

1114
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,710
Sorry that I'm kind of late asking.

1115
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,590
What if I transform?

1116
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,690
What if I went really fast?

1117
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,710
Each character has a unique ability that can be performed by pressing L1.

1118
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,630
Deplete the ability gauge, but this gauge refills over time.

1119
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:15,990
Well...

1120
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,200
Kick their butts!

1121
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,140
And we're gonna go...

1122
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:32,900
Where did he go?

1123
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:40,430
Ok!

1124
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,180
I missed.

1125
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,180
Anyway...

1126
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,740
Good job!

1127
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:14,060
We did it.

1128
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,020
Very nice.

1129
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,660
Five big booms.

1130
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,400
It's good?

1131
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,160
Ok, thank you.

1132
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,080
Oh, ok!

1133
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,560
Thanks Optimus!

1134
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,560
Look, there's stuff over here.

1135
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,320
I can't leave yet.

1136
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,840
There's goodies.

1137
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,720
Oh my gosh!

1138
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,920
Optimus Prime is covering me!

1139
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,660
How lucky.

1140
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,680
Lucky for us.

1141
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,180
What's this way?

1142
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,520
This looks kind of fun.

1143
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,160
What is this?

1144
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,380
Here we go!

1145
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,520
I'm on a racetrack all of a sudden.

1146
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,500
I hope I don't die here.

1147
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,380
What?

1148
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:16,700
Oh!

1149
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:17,840
Enter?

1150
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,380
Enter?

1151
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,620
I'm trying to click enter!

1152
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:23,660
I'm too fast.

1153
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,620
Oh, side mission!

1154
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,620
Let's try it.

1155
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,560
It's our first side mission, so...

1156
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,380
Defeat all enemies!

1157
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,750
What was this ability?

1158
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,170
I think it's a rush attack or something?

1159
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,970
Oh, that was...

1160
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,310
Blackhead!

1161
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,930
Oh, I had another one.

1162
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,560
Where's the goal?

1163
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,700
Over here?

1164
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:24,730
They're shooting at me!

1165
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,550
I didn't get it.

1166
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:26,750
No!

1167
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,400
See ya!

1168
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,720
I reached the goal.

1169
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,400
I did not defeat all enemies.

1170
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,880
Oh, shoot.

1171
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,920
There's Harker.

1172
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,900
Oh,

1173
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,270
dang.

1174
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:03,550
Loser!

1175
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,970
Loser!

1176
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,810
Did I get all the guys?

1177
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,470
I guess so.

1178
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:19,820
No?

1179
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,740
Is this not the...

1180
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,490
Red dot?

1181
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,650
Oh, I think I see them.

1182
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:50,690
We

1183
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,980
got 30 seconds!

1184
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,460
Oh no!

1185
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,060
There's more?

1186
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:10,640
Where?

1187
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:11,800
Where?

1188
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:14,660
Where?

1189
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,340
Guys,

1190
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:21,770
we're not gonna make it.

1191
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,740
So lame!

1192
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,300
I thought those were just like, you know, like little turrets or something.

1193
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,480
I didn't realize that they were...

1194
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:52,820
I didn't realize that they were actual guys.

1195
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,080
Dang.

1196
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,860
Fish and mailed.

1197
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,920
Did we get to keep all the stuff though?

1198
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,700
I think so.

1199
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,380
Look at the little bugs.

1200
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:03,980
Little buggies.

1201
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,630
What would we get if we beat the mission though?

1202
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,010
You can repeat?

1203
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:19,490
You can?

1204
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:21,490
Let's see.

1205
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:25,530
I don't plan on doing all the side missions, so...

1206
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:29,490
Like, you know, just to...

1207
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:35,090
Just as like, if it's just like, oh I missed one, it's okay.

1208
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,690
I just really wanted to try this one since it's the first one, right?

1209
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,950
We can get cool weapons.

1210
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:06,040
I always miss the second...

1211
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,830
Let's get our stuff.

1212
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,270
Let's get our things.

1213
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,910
I don't actually know what all this stuff is, so...

1214
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,010
Slice and dice, baby!

1215
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,750
Maybe I should be in vehicle mode right now, but that's okay!

1216
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,450
Bam!

1217
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:38,490
Bam!

1218
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,550
Bam!

1219
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,810
And where are these guys at?

1220
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:43,910
Oh, secret...

1221
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:47,110
Oop!

1222
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,090
Bam!

1223
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:48,490
Bam!

1224
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,090
Bam!

1225
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:51,330
We'll just run here through here for now.

1226
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,450
Slow, slow, slow, slow.

1227
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:58,970
And bam!

1228
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,510
The auto-lock is so great.

1229
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,790
Thank you, auto-lock.

1230
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,620
I like how I can lift him up.

1231
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,040
It's kind of awesome.

1232
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah!

1233
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,480
Oh, shoot.

1234
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,460
Did I get them all now?

1235
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,420
Ah, there's more!

1236
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,060
Where did you guys spawn from?

1237
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,460
There we go.

1238
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,760
I just don't know how to...

1239
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,000
Change the weapons.

1240
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,900
I'm getting these new weapons and I don't even know what to do with them.

1241
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,180
Anyway.

1242
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,700
Optimus is gone.

1243
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,400
He's got tired of waiting for me.

1244
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,400
After mission.

1245
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,840
What is this?

1246
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:32,860
Okay.

1247
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,990
Do I want to... No, I'm just gonna run.

1248
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,710
Okay, now I can just...

1249
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,870
Nevermind.

1250
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,270
Will they have... Dang shields.

1251
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,660
You guys, I got an S rank!

1252
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,460
Oh my gosh, I've been consistently getting B's, but with that I got an S.

1253
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:15,600
Yeah!

1254
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,500
Which way should I be going?

1255
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,780
No, no, no.

1256
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,820
Well, I think I can do...

1257
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,900
What's the ground pound?

1258
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,840
I was just being a little silly about it.

1259
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,580
Follow the orange dot.

1260
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,620
Yeah, but what's over here?

1261
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,600
What is that?

1262
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,600
Oh, you want me to be...

1263
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,320
That's okay, I'll loop around it.

1264
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,180
Dang it.

1265
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,840
Drive through it.

1266
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,760
Maybe... Hold on, let's go high speed.

1267
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,280
Oh, wait.

1268
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,220
Oh, just kidding.

1269
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:09,820
That's nothing.

1270
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,280
Okay.

1271
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:10,360
Okay.

1272
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,380
Where am I?

1273
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,120
See ya!

1274
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,780
Give me all this crazy train!

1275
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,640
What was I attacking anyway?

1276
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,720
It was trying to attack me.

1277
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,400
Holy shit, it's a...

1278
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:40,900
Glove!

1279
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,240
Claw!

1280
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,400
The claw!

1281
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,760
And I was out of that range.

1282
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,010
I'm not fast enough.

1283
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,350
I need to be faster.

1284
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,900
Oh yeah, yeah.

1285
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,160
Got him.

1286
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,760
Punch it.

1287
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,960
Yeah, but I like to shoot.

1288
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,240
Where are we anyway?

1289
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,500
We're explorers.

1290
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,400
Sorry guys, I love exploring in games.

1291
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,360
I don't know if you noticed.

1292
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,020
I'm always... You can't keep me on one path.

1293
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,400
Watch the pain.

1294
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:38,880
Oh gosh!

1295
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,820
Ah, dammit.

1296
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,420
This game is so crazy.

1297
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,620
I won't even open the door in the meantime.

1298
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,460
Minky the Explorer.

1299
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,010
Okay.

1300
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,710
Okay.

1301
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,170
Oh, whoops.

1302
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,690
I'm dumbing down.

1303
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:41,950
Too windy for robots.

1304
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:43,850
Oh

1305
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:47,680
what?

1306
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,900
I pressed square?

1307
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:55,820
There we go.

1308
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,380
Where are we?

1309
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,220
I'm definitely gonna get lost.

1310
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,180
Where are we?

1311
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,220
I'm gonna get lost, aren't I?

1312
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:10,480
Okay, let's go to the point that we were supposed to go to.

1313
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,520
Parking.

1314
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,440
No parking!

1315
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,240
I'm gonna get mega lost.

1316
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,620
Megatron mega lost.

1317
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,720
Uh oh, what's going on up there?

1318
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,320
That don't look good.

1319
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,300
The fastest thing ever.

1320
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,800
I don't like what's going on up there.

1321
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,420
I don't like what's going on up here.

1322
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,740
They're just attacking the building for what?

1323
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,340
What are you attacking the building for?

1324
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,680
Oops.

1325
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,680
I knew that was gonna happen.

1326
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,580
Man.

1327
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,080
Auto aim is so generous.

1328
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,630
Left this building in particular.

1329
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,000
I am going the right way though.

1330
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,720
Where's the next guy?

1331
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,760
We shall become a car.

1332
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,440
Oh no, I'm a car and I can't jump over buildings.

1333
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,720
I will become a car.

1334
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,720
And I will drive!

1335
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,020
Drive!

1336
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,340
Oh, okay.

1337
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:06,110
And I think that's one last guy.

1338
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,130
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1339
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,170
Am I out of bullets?

1340
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,690
No?

1341
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:10,750
I just missed?

1342
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,850
Maybe he blew up my...

1343
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,710
I got the guy over there.

1344
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:20,750
There's one more.

1345
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,010
Oh, I wish I could see through here.

1346
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,610
Oh, he's up there, he's up there.

1347
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,690
I think we got him.

1348
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:35,350
Nice.

1349
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:42,560
Nice, nice.

1350
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,120
Made a miso.

1351
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,460
Yeah, but that's like Mr. Donuts.

1352
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:58,970
Misudo.

1353
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:00,830
Misudo is Mr. Donuts.

1354
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,340
Pegaburger combo.

1355
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,280
For 650!

1356
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,460
You guys!

1357
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,260
Look at... That might be the best deal I've ever seen in my entire afterlife.

1358
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,520
A steal!

1359
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,460
1984.

1360
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,260
Old game.

1361
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,500
Megaburger.

1362
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,960
Megatron?

1363
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,920
Everything mega is better.

1364
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,780
If evil, why cool.

1365
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,680
Who am I fighting?

1366
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,480
Oh, there they are.

1367
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,700
I can hide.

1368
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:13,960
Oh my god.

1369
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,830
I didn't make it through.

1370
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,130
They're waiting to ambush me.

1371
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,810
Am I on the right path?

1372
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:26,850
I think so.

1373
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:30,070
I think I must be.

1374
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,670
I thought I saw something shiny over here.

1375
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:34,210
Just kidding.

1376
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:39,150
Her name was Megato and she wasn't so short.

1377
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:39,990
That's what I'm saying!

1378
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:41,730
Inflation comes for us all?

1379
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,210
Even a 5 dollar foot long?

1380
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:44,870
Don't say that.

1381
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,010
You know what inflation will never come for?

1382
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,050
The Costco hotdog.

1383
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,950
Oh gosh, I can't!

1384
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,770
Oh, I missed!

1385
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,210
Nevermind.

1386
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,290
I still got him.

1387
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,030
I'm too good at this.

1388
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:15,310
I think I got him.

1389
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:17,270
Where am I?

1390
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:22,030
Oh, this guy.

1391
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:22,690
Oh my goodness.

1392
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:23,610
Shoot.

1393
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,510
Ok, hold on.

1394
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,150
There's two of them?

1395
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:29,930
Damn it.

1396
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,750
See, I'm too slow if I...

1397
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,170
I'm slow.

1398
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,520
Ok, nice.

1399
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,180
I got one.

1400
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,020
You don't need to shoot every time.

1401
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,680
I do!

1402
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,320
In fact, watch me!

1403
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,760
I will be fired.

1404
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,620
This one is going to be tricky.

1405
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:26,920
Just kidding.

1406
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,260
It wasn't tricky at all.

1407
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,040
I'm too good at the game!

1408
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,000
Now I'm scared.

1409
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:52,510
Where

1410
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,030
are you, cowards?

1411
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,370
Come back!

1412
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:04,710
Stream snipe.

1413
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:08,650
Costco hotdog sponsorship.

1414
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:11,870
Oh yeah, they totally...

1415
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,270
That's the wrong button.

1416
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,610
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1417
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,440
I'm so cool!

1418
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,680
Aren't I?

1419
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,380
Aren't I so cool?

1420
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,180
Did you see that?

1421
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:37,980
Did you see that?

1422
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,600
Did you see that?

1423
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,220
I got his stuff.

1424
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,140
Was there anything else over here I missed?

1425
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,360
I don't think so.

1426
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:50,820
Oh, uh...

1427
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,920
There was like some guy.

1428
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:52,500
You know, whatever.

1429
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,280
I don't care about him.

1430
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,800
Too cool for school?

1431
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,120
No.

1432
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,860
And you shouldn't be too cool for school either.

1433
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:10,900
Hotdog.

1434
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,460
Roll for Costco hotdogs.

1435
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,220
Somehow directing them.

1436
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,300
Costco glizzy stream.

1437
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,420
Oh my god, he's hacking!

1438
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,660
He's downloading the information.

1439
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:31,600
Oh my god!

1440
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,440
The ambulance!

1441
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,440
The whambulance is coming to pick him up!

1442
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:43,200
Oh, I will be followed.

1443
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,780
OK!

1444
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:51,580
I'm guessing those are bombs so I won't touch them.

1445
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,200
Pass through plasma accelerators?

1446
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:56,940
Oh!

1447
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,220
To gain speed.

1448
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,660
Oh, OK, those are...

1449
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,980
Oh, OK, OK, the plasma accelerators are the little...OK, OK, the barriers.

1450
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,500
Oh, shoot.

1451
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:10,940
Right.

1452
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,340
We're good.

1453
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,190
Oh my god, I can't see!

1454
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,610
I'm on your butt.

1455
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,390
I'm on your ass, Megatron.

1456
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,530
Megatron, Megatron, I'm like right on your ass.

1457
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:28,730
Megatron, Megatron.

1458
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,210
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1459
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:33,590
Oh, I can fire at him.

1460
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,960
Oh, the R1!

1461
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:42,880
I'm such an idiot.

1462
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,860
I thought it was L1.

1463
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,460
Which wouldn't make much sense because...

1464
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,580
Bye, Megatron!

1465
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,940
I'm better than you!

1466
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,640
I'm faster than you!

1467
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,580
Where are you?

1468
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,640
Oh my god, there you are.

1469
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,230
Oh my god.

1470
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,130
Ouch, ouch.

1471
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:22,450
Where did he

1472
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,420
go?

1473
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,340
Oh, he's faster now.

1474
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,440
How did he get so fast?

1475
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,180
He's a literal tank.

1476
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:38,390
Where did he go?

1477
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,010
Oh, am I?

1478
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:40,690
Am I?

1479
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,890
Ouch.

1480
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,210
Wrong way!

1481
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,920
Oh no!

1482
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,700
Scooby Doo moment.

1483
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,900
They knew that would happen though.

1484
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:06,820
They had you loop.

1485
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,360
They had you loop.

1486
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,200
Oh gosh!

1487
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,920
Oh shoot.

1488
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,540
That was not good.

1489
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,600
Get beat!

1490
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,600
Get beat!

1491
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:35,440
Oh

1492
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,560
shoot, damn.

1493
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,280
I tried to dodge.

1494
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:57,160
Oh, that's his...

1495
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,260
Damn, I shouldn't have dodged that.

1496
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,380
Take that Megatron!

1497
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,540
Oh damn, he really did take that.

1498
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:17,510
Get blasted.

1499
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:20,530
He took that.

1500
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:21,330
Side swipe.

1501
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:39,250
This game is so fun.

1502
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:41,550
It plays so well.

1503
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,790
Even when I can't see what's going on.

1504
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:53,670
No,

1505
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,310
I don't want to...

1506
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,630
Roll out!

1507
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,570
Alright, fine.

1508
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,850
I shut down three sub-generators.

1509
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,390
I've transformed and I'm rolling out.

1510
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,710
What's that green?

1511
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:13,150
What's this green?

1512
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,790
Too fast for my own good.

1513
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:18,870
Green!

1514
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:22,750
Green?

1515
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,220
I thought it froze for a second.

1516
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:28,960
I was kind of scared.

1517
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,380
Lightning gloves.

1518
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,740
Twin steel swords.

1519
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,620
Lightning machine gun.

1520
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,480
Basic missiles.

1521
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,180
Cryo gloves.

1522
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,140
Everything is ranked D though.

1523
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,120
Cryo hammer.

1524
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:06,940
C!

1525
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,860
Cryo machine gun.

1526
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,380
Thermal sword.

1527
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:20,320
D for damn good.

1528
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:22,920
Shock sniper rifle.

1529
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,900
Lightning sword.

1530
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,500
Raiden.

1531
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,340
SWC Ronin, thank you for the pink!

1532
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,380
Mecha made me into a model someday would be amazing.

1533
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,920
I think Ayamimama would probably kill me.

1534
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,240
She'd be like, I don't have control of that.

1535
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:54,720
Maybe I would have to commission somebody more mecha inclined.

1536
01:32:55,940 --> 01:33:01,180
If Megatron was walking through the parks and got attacked by 10 pigeons, who do you think would win?

1537
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,260
Megatron is equipped with a chicken sandwich.

1538
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:05,240
What is this?

1539
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:08,660
Why do people keep talking about this chicken sandwich?

1540
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,120
And the pigeons.

1541
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,200
Where did this come from?

1542
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,160
Wow, we got a lot of weapons, didn't we?

1543
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:15,920
Rare!

1544
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,420
Oh my gosh.

1545
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,140
Hyper lightning hammer.

1546
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:25,100
I want the lightning hammer.

1547
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,040
Is it slow?

1548
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,600
No, this is the cryo hammer.

1549
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:29,420
This one.

1550
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,900
Now you can have the option to change characters.

1551
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,520
Use L2 or R2 to choose which character you'd like to play as.

1552
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,620
Oh, what?

1553
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,600
Oh my gosh.

1554
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,520
I could be Sideswipe.

1555
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,260
I could be Optimus.

1556
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,700
I like Bumblebee.

1557
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,740
Playing as Bumblebee though.

1558
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,020
I'm glad you like the long hair.

1559
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:57,700
So if I give him... Can he... Did it say that he could equip it?

1560
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,360
I didn't see.

1561
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,800
It showed me who.

1562
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,180
His gloves.

1563
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,320
Oh, he can.

1564
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,300
Only Optimus can.

1565
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,460
It looks like.

1566
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:12,380
Oh man.

1567
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,400
What else do I have that's rank C?

1568
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,700
Prime's axe.

1569
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,120
Nah, it's too big for him.

1570
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,300
He's just a teeny baby.

1571
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,880
Oh, this.

1572
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,020
The shock blaster.

1573
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,500
We could try it.

1574
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,930
We could try it.

1575
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:53,350
I do like playing as Bumblebee because he's super nimble.

1576
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:55,610
Look at him.

1577
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,230
He's so chill.

1578
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,450
What a chill guy.

1579
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:58,890
I'm Bumblebee.

1580
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,750
Oh my gosh, he can talk.

1581
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:01,850
That's right.

1582
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:06,610
Ever since Michael Bay, they made Bumblebee unspeaking.

1583
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:08,750
Except in Transformers 1.

1584
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,430
He's just a little baby.

1585
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,750
Everyone copy that from Bay.

1586
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,030
Stinky.

1587
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:32,330
I like his character a lot though in Transformers 1.

1588
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:39,830
He's not like... Usually I find that maybe those types of characters can be a little too much.

1589
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,390
But he's not too much I think.

1590
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:45,510
He's just the right amount of annoyingly funny.

1591
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,070
Badass dread.

1592
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,650
He's just right.

1593
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,770
If he were any more, I think it would have been a push too far.

1594
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:04,090
But I think he's just goofy.

1595
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,150
OK, let's try it.

1596
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:13,390
Equip and develop tech?

1597
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:18,950
No way.

1598
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:21,290
Oh my gosh, is there like a skill tree?

1599
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,490
Or is it Minecraft?

1600
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:24,730
What are we building?

1601
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,350
Nothing apparently.

1602
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,070
Nevermind.

1603
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:30,850
We have nothing to make.

1604
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:37,810
Neither does sideswipe.

1605
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:44,250
Megatron must be stopped.

1606
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:44,410
Stopped.

1607
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:49,270
Megatron must be stopped.

1608
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,470
What are we waiting for?

1609
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,750
Oh yeah, he's thinking.

1610
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:59,250
Ready, ready, ready.

1611
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,170
Follow me.

1612
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:04,210
Must be stopped.

1613
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:07,210
He's putting on his thinking hat.

1614
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:08,430
OK.

1615
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,030
Oh wait, I have to develop stuff first.

1616
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:12,910
I'm a dummy-dum.

1617
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:15,530
5000.

1618
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:29,410
Equip.

1619
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:31,590
Let's do another one.

1620
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:34,930
Not the skill check though.

1621
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:40,730
There's lag.

1622
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:44,590
There's lag.

1623
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:45,450
What is this?

1624
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:47,450
Weapon energy recovers gradually.

1625
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,350
Melee attack up.

1626
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:51,130
Yeah, whatever.

1627
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:51,990
I'll do one more.

1628
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,210
Is the ping, is the ping?

1629
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,910
My finger slipped.

1630
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,230
It's never my fault you guys.

1631
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:01,610
I don't know what to tell you.

1632
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,030
It's never my fault.

1633
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:07,110
But that was all me baby!

1634
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,230
Ally heal.

1635
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,300
It's never my fault until I do well!

1636
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:22,120
Do I need to save this stuff for like other...

1637
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:24,920
No!

1638
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,040
What an absolute failure!

1639
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,300
OK.

1640
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,080
I hope I don't have to save this money for something else.

1641
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,340
First try.

1642
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,660
Lag for sure.

1643
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,120
Wait, so let's equip.

1644
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,340
Let's get rid of that one.

1645
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,500
What was the good one we did?

1646
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:49,180
This one.

1647
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,080
And then, enhance radar.

1648
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,040
Shows hidden treasure on the minimap.

1649
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:00,600
Wheelie Jack and Sideswipe cameo as cogless miners in TF1.

1650
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,540
They do!

1651
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:06,260
Wheelie Jack is the one who accidentally triggers the mine cave-in at the start of the movie.

1652
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,060
I'll have to watch it again!

1653
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,300
Came for the robot stage from MitoTron.

1654
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,120
Thank you!

1655
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,840
Thank you so much for the super chat.

1656
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,880
Thank you for the first ever.

1657
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:20,220
Glad you stayed alive.

1658
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:21,700
OK.

1659
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:23,720
No moves!

1660
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,760
Oh my gosh.

1661
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,200
Bye?

1662
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,580
Bye, bye, bye!

1663
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:30,420
Oh!

1664
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,140
That's what our money is for!

1665
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,680
OK guys, I just wasted all of our money.

1666
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Grimlock's gloves!

1667
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,800
Oh, dang it!

1668
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:56,500
Why did you guys stop me?

1669
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,920
OK, anyway.

1670
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,080
Let's try... Wait, I can change the difficulty through here?

1671
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,120
Wow, that's so nice!

1672
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,240
I feel really comfortable playing it like this though.

1673
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,400
I'm having a lot of fun.

1674
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,160
I'm having a lot of fun.

1675
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,120
Sorry I'm a little scout.

1676
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,520
I'm a girl scout.

1677
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,880
Find the sub-generator.

1678
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:19,360
That's right.

1679
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,420
That's what we were doing.

1680
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,900
Is there one in here?

1681
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh gosh, that's kind of spooky.

1682
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,700
What is this?

1683
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,680
Wait.

1684
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,480
No, no, no!

1685
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,060
That's his new ability!

1686
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,280
It shows us where hidden things are!

1687
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,520
Oh my gosh.

1688
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,740
Very nice.

1689
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,700
We can't go this way.

1690
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,920
That's where we came from anyway.

1691
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,080
And there is a thing over here.

1692
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,800
Actual ground pan.

1693
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,040
We are going to be rich.

1694
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,020
I hope so.

1695
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,380
Use your fists.

1696
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,620
Alright, I guess we have to go into the scary hole.

1697
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:24,910
I hope that person had insurance.

1698
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:29,850
There are bugs in here!

1699
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:33,390
Oh!

1700
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:45,390
Take that, dummy bozo!

1701
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,010
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1702
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,400
Where did the other guy go?

1703
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,320
He is literally hiding behind that wall.

1704
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,300
You see him?

1705
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,840
What are you doing over there?

1706
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,730
Maybe he won't notice me.

1707
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:10,950
What?

1708
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:14,910
Oh, I think he is stuck by the wind.

1709
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:20,010
Stupid.

1710
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:22,250
Can I hurt the bugs?

1711
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:25,050
Bugs!

1712
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:26,490
They don't notice us?

1713
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:32,190
Yeah, I'm still going to kill them though.

1714
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,800
I'm too good!

1715
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,420
I'm too good!

1716
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,440
What the hell is that?

1717
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:10,130
You scared the heck out of me.

1718
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:14,950
Gosh.

1719
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,380
Thanks for playing this.

1720
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:32,700
It's awesome to see one of my favorite streamers experiencing one of my favorite franchises.

1721
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,960
If you were a maximal Predacon, what would your beast mode be?

1722
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,720
That's a great question.

1723
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,400
I think I got everything in there.

1724
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:47,340
I don't know.

1725
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:55,680
Frog?

1726
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,420
Monkey?

1727
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,360
Oh my gosh, it would have to be a monkey, right?

1728
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:03,580
Nice.

1729
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:11,320
Thank you.

1730
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:13,900
I think it has to be a monkey.

1731
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:14,260
Minky.

1732
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:16,960
Minky type.

1733
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,600
Alright, so there is one right there.

1734
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,220
Auto jerk.

1735
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,620
Oh no, the constructed guys.

1736
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:36,660
He is so fantastic.

1737
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:40,340
Let's see how you Autobots look on my hook.

1738
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,720
Holy fast.

1739
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:43,280
OK.

1740
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,260
They are huge.

1741
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,160
Damn it.

1742
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,120
I could not see where they were.

1743
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,780
Oh my God.

1744
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:06,400
Why didn't I dodge?

1745
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:07,360
Why didn't I dodge?

1746
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,680
Oh shoot.

1747
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:34,700
Hello?

1748
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:40,440
Oh my God.

1749
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:50,370
Auto jerk is my best.

1750
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:57,680
Too easy.

1751
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,940
Says the guy who couldn't even land a hit.

1752
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:08,640
Punched him right out of transformation.

1753
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,700
I

1754
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:18,680
keep missing the vehicle.

1755
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:22,040
Oh shoot.

1756
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,950
I thought I dodged.

1757
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:47,750
I dodged too early.

1758
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:52,590
These guys are so beefy.

1759
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:56,850
OK.

1760
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:57,530
One down.

1761
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:57,970
Nice.

1762
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:59,250
Come on.

1763
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:00,750
I was...

1764
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:04,990
Are you OK Bumblebee?

1765
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:16,690
Nice.

1766
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:18,190
He is almost there.

1767
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,340
Jeez.

1768
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:35,620
I love the dodge going into car mode.

1769
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,780
It's so awesome.

1770
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,820
It's so awesome.

1771
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,020
OK.

1772
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,460
What if I... Oh I don't think... Oh I have to search it?

1773
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,140
Let's see.

1774
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:50,800
Oh gosh.

1775
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,340
I think I'm going to need to...

1776
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,320
Oh.

1777
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,060
Never mind.

1778
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,340
I thought I needed to break in.

1779
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,520
OK.

1780
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,200
I might need to take a second.

1781
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,280
Thanks Optimus.

1782
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:15,840
I'm going to go grab some eye drops really quick because my eyes are like...

1783
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,980
My ectoplasm must be so dry today.

1784
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:18,620
I don't know why.

1785
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:24,860
I think it's just lack of sleep so my eyes are a little bit...

1786
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:27,340
I know I'm not blinking.

1787
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,840
I'm literally like this at the screen.

1788
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,780
My eye drops are just in the bathroom so I'll just go grab them real quick.

1789
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:38,620
And then I'll come back.

1790
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,980
Be right back.

1791
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:40,660
Like in two seconds.

1792
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:07,680
As soon as I opened the door I got ambushed by a little girl.

1793
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:09,560
Pause.

1794
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:14,640
My kitten pause wanted to be in here.

1795
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:19,670
She's going to want out in like two seconds though.

1796
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:20,630
Let me put in the eye drops.

1797
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,960
I don't know why they are hurting so much.

1798
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:39,380
Pause.

1799
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,140
Oh my god.

1800
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:49,260
I turned around to look at her and she was already stretched out completely on the floor.

1801
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:55,000
She's one of those types of cats that loves to stick her legs out and her arms out and look like a banana.

1802
01:49:55,980 --> 01:50:00,200
She's already a banana on the floor.

1803
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:03,940
Pause.

1804
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:06,420
Well then I'm going to kiss her a little bit.

1805
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,640
Little girl.

1806
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,120
Sweet baby.

1807
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,160
Sweet baby girl.

1808
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:25,760
What are you doing?

1809
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:26,800
What are you doing?

1810
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,340
You want to sit on my chair?

1811
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:30,520
No?

1812
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,980
You want to lick yourself on the ground?

1813
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:32,220
Okay.

1814
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:36,140
She'll probably want out in like a couple minutes so...

1815
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,100
That's okay.

1816
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:42,080
Especially because I'm going to be screaming a lot from this game.

1817
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:42,600
Alright.

1818
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,600
Let's roll out.

1819
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:47,720
Oh shoot.

1820
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:48,580
I missed it.

1821
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,380
Let's try again.

1822
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,400
Oh and I even missed the stop.

1823
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:55,880
I missed the goods.

1824
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:02,710
Nice.

1825
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:05,750
Alright we got it.

1826
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:06,650
Right?

1827
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,770
Sweet little girl versus stinky boy.

1828
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:10,910
Okay.

1829
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:14,090
Hold on.

1830
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,350
She's causing mischief.

1831
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:16,170
Sorry.

1832
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,920
She's just chirp-chirping at a bird outside.

1833
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:35,800
Okay.

1834
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,220
Where?

1835
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:50,320
Dang it, I missed it.

1836
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,560
Ouchie ouch.

1837
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:05,900
Oh I did it.

1838
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:07,460
I'm too good.

1839
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:13,380
If you want to be a transformer fighter jet, ask your art mama to draw you similar to Midia from Gundam Legend.

1840
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:14,760
Oh sorry, not Gundam.

1841
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:15,120
Oh my gosh.

1842
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,980
Guardian Legend.

1843
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:16,960
It's old school.

1844
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:19,620
They might not get a headache with that style.

1845
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,060
Oh, look into it.

1846
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:21,660
Thank you.

1847
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,140
Thanks for the superchat too.

1848
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,360
Okay.

1849
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:29,500
Wumblebee.

1850
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:31,640
Let's punch...

1851
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,040
Whoa!

1852
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,520
Oh,

1853
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,820
I dodged too soon.

1854
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:39,600
Gosh.

1855
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:41,960
Please.

1856
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,980
There we go.

1857
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:53,140
Alrighty.

1858
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,740
We're back to 9000 money.

1859
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,660
That's not bad.

1860
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,100
Oh it's Wumblebee's L1.

1861
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,520
Oh he does a little slide.

1862
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:06,720
That's fun.

1863
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:09,160
Gundam Legend.

1864
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:12,540
Wait, I'm off?

1865
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:19,900
Just kidding.

1866
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,400
I didn't want to go that way.

1867
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:27,720
Just...

1868
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,980
I'm zooming...through.

1869
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,320
Oh, and I missed all of them.

1870
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,100
Well, all but one.

1871
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,900
Give it in the air!

1872
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,500
Holy shit!

1873
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,800
Ultimate combo!

1874
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:05,400
I didn't even let him have a chance to breathe.

1875
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,640
Didn't even have a chance to breathe.

1876
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:11,940
Stupid dummy.

1877
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:14,620
Gotcha.

1878
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,440
Not...Oh, I forgot Wumblebee's...

1879
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:26,120
Wumblebee's, like, missiles are his machine gun.

1880
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,500
Took out a Decepticon Spy Ops.

1881
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,380
Unlock new scene for the art gallery.

1882
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,120
Oh, cool!

1883
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,220
There's one more guy though over there.

1884
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,400
It's a little unruly.

1885
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,000
Oh my gosh.

1886
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,400
There we go.

1887
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,900
What am I hearing?

1888
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,240
Just kidding.

1889
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,720
Where is this thing?

1890
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,920
Can I go through this way?

1891
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:09,420
Maybe.

1892
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,680
Sparks and plugs.

1893
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:15,760
Oh, wait.

1894
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:16,560
In here?

1895
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,760
Okay, this is where we were gonna go before.

1896
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,660
Who's gonna ambush me in here?

1897
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,640
Oh, nobody.

1898
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:36,280
Oh my god!

1899
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:43,640
Green

1900
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,490
is where we can shop, right?

1901
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:03,630
I'm so lost.

1902
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:05,670
Wait, there's another secret over here.

1903
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,850
That we can't get to.

1904
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:16,510
This place is a maze.

1905
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:20,390
Have you heard much about the old comics?

1906
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:24,150
More than meets the eye, I had a lot of Old Man Yaoi and a lot of Neat Megatron.

1907
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:30,730
I'm never... I can't say that I've ever been much of a comic book reader.

1908
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,870
I'm too much of a weeaboo, you know?

1909
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,750
Where I'm... Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1910
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:43,630
I'm more of a manga enjoyer myself.

1911
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:48,850
Because you can't read.

1912
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:51,250
Where did you get that idea from?

1913
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:51,870
Oh my god.

1914
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:53,010
Okay, alright.

1915
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,560
Dammit, I missed one.

1916
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:11,480
I'm just gonna keep ramming them.

1917
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,120
I think I got them.

1918
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,320
Wrecked.

1919
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,940
Okay, so these did power... I don't think we were able to go in this one before, so...

1920
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:42,630
I forgot.

1921
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:46,790
Okay, I think for these I just have to like...

1922
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:54,480
Just keep going.

1923
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,400
Just get out of there.

1924
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:56,040
There we go.

1925
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,020
No!

1926
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:07,850
Scavenger.

1927
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:11,570
Oh my god.

1928
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:19,410
Oh my gosh!

1929
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:21,050
Look at this pompadour!

1930
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:25,290
I should have dodged that one.

1931
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,510
They work the same way as before.

1932
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:30,670
Oh my god.

1933
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:31,250
Oh my god.

1934
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:31,830
Oh my god.

1935
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:35,750
Ah!

1936
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:36,070
Shit!

1937
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,570
Shit!

1938
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:36,890
Shit!

1939
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:19,840
Oh my gosh.

1940
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:20,440
He's gone.

1941
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:25,600
Wait, I

1942
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:31,480
think...

1943
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,540
Come here, bonk!

1944
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:33,500
Crush it!

1945
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:01,790
Nice!

1946
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:11,460
Oh shoot!

1947
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:12,700
Oh my god.

1948
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:22,270
Heal!

1949
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:23,210
Oh damn.

1950
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,500
Back attack!

1951
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,000
Back attack!

1952
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,720
Damn, that does a lot of damage.

1953
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:42,760
Nice.

1954
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,420
Made Domingo with the devious back shots.

1955
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:56,380
Splattered.

1956
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:59,100
Oh, I think I just lost that money.

1957
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:00,840
Sad.

1958
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,520
Maybe you can dodge five times in a row.

1959
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:06,620
Really?

1960
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:12,660
Baby so strong.

1961
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:16,780
Bumblebee.

1962
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:22,140
Oh my gosh, it's the mega burger combo.

1963
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,700
Oh shit, they're coming after me again.

1964
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:31,180
Ouch!

1965
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:33,340
Ouch!

1966
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,640
Oh, it's this thing again.

1967
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:42,260
Where are you?

1968
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,460
Oh, I'm trying.

1969
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,240
I'm trying to pick it up.

1970
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,040
I'm trying to pick him up.

1971
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:55,480
Pick up!

1972
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:55,740
Pick up!

1973
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,020
Pick up!

1974
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:59,220
I'm spamming C.

1975
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:00,600
Circle?

1976
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:01,400
Sorry.

1977
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,240
I was thinking C.

1978
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:07,340
Can I not pick up while I'm in there?

1979
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:08,880
I should.

1980
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,460
Oh my god.

1981
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:13,440
Pick up!

1982
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:14,260
Pick up!

1983
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:14,600
Pick up!

1984
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:15,920
Pick up my calls!

1985
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:17,060
Please!

1986
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:19,740
Why won't you call me anymore?

1987
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:24,390
He doesn't get low.

1988
02:02:24,510 --> 02:02:25,050
Maybe here.

1989
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:26,670
I'm spamming the button.

1990
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:31,190
Is there a spot that I can get to him?

1991
02:02:33,490 --> 02:02:34,730
I got him!

1992
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:42,850
Call us back, Crimsy.

1993
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:44,810
I'm scared.

1994
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:45,710
I'm just gonna run.

1995
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:48,690
What's down here?

1996
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:52,450
Interesting.

1997
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:54,090
Not where we need to go though.

1998
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:56,750
More art.

1999
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:00,570
I love the art in this game.

2000
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:03,790
So stylized.

2001
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:05,390
It's great.

2002
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:24,910
This looks like a new area.

2003
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:27,130
Oh, it's right here.

2004
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:28,370
How easy.

2005
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:31,510
You'll have to go through us first.

2006
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:34,630
How strong you're steel, Autobots.

2007
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:37,030
Complete the conquest.

2008
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:40,450
Mix master and long haul.

2009
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:52,950
Back to attack!

2010
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,910
Back attack!

2011
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:55,450
Back attack!

2012
02:03:55,690 --> 02:03:56,350
Back attack!

2013
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:08,910
Back attack!

2014
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:13,540
Bam!

2015
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:16,020
Oh, he blocked it.

2016
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,620
Bumblebee is special.

2017
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,280
I think he zooms forward, right?

2018
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,840
That was a close one.

2019
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:31,400
That was a close one.

2020
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,540
Back attack!

2021
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,700
I got hit against the invisible wall.

2022
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:51,850
Yeah, that's right.

2023
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:53,910
Where are you?

2024
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:54,550
There you are.

2025
02:04:55,810 --> 02:04:56,450
Oh shit!

2026
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:02,590
Yeah, take that!

2027
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:03,850
He's low.

2028
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:04,290
He's low.

2029
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:06,190
Come here.

2030
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:18,450
Nice zoom.

2031
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:19,830
And a back attack.

2032
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:56,190
Ouchie, ouchie.

2033
02:06:03,110 --> 02:06:04,190
So close.

2034
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:15,530
Yeah!

2035
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:20,330
Loot gone.

2036
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:20,810
It's OK.

2037
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:28,170
You're talking about his, right?

2038
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:28,970
Yeah, it's OK.

2039
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:29,670
Don't worry about it.

2040
02:06:31,610 --> 02:06:32,290
We'll get more.

2041
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:36,370
Oh yeah, my slide.

2042
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:36,430
Again.

2043
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,780
Welcome to membership.

2044
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,440
Thank you!

2045
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:51,450
Alrighty.

2046
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:55,010
Uncover the cause of disturbance in the city.

2047
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:56,470
We gotta go back?

2048
02:06:57,550 --> 02:06:59,010
Can we not go this way though?

2049
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:00,390
Then we just get rid of this thing?

2050
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:11,700
Holy shit!

2051
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:26,750
Damn.

2052
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,940
Never knew it was coming.

2053
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:35,500
Give me more heal.

2054
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:36,100
Yeah!

2055
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,340
And my money.

2056
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,560
Oh, my money.

2057
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:52,050
Oh, wait.

2058
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:53,830
No, I don't know where we are.

2059
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:56,830
I know we are definitely not on track, but that's OK.

2060
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:03,350
I have no idea where we are.

2061
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:06,550
Oh, we can go that way.

2062
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:11,450
We can go this way.

2063
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:14,390
But how do I get this thing?

2064
02:08:16,110 --> 02:08:16,930
Can I shoot it?

2065
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,620
I don't want to waste all my bullets.

2066
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:26,540
Shoot at it?

2067
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:27,100
Wait, seriously?

2068
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:27,840
It'll work?

2069
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:29,860
Hold on, what other bullets do I got?

2070
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:32,340
Oh my gosh, my shock blaster.

2071
02:08:37,170 --> 02:08:38,130
Heavy attack.

2072
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:46,200
Are you OK?

2073
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:47,480
She went out.

2074
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:48,780
Hold on, let me let my cat out.

2075
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,540
Look how cool he is.

2076
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:52,620
Stop!

2077
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,640
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2078
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:57,020
When she wants something, she starts pulling at the curtains.

2079
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:16,840
She does that.

2080
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,760
She pulls at the curtains when she wants something.

2081
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,460
And then, Butaro also started doing that.

2082
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,040
He learned from her.

2083
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:26,800
He learned from her.

2084
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:29,200
He didn't use to do that until she started.

2085
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,920
That influence indeed.

2086
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:37,840
Alright.

2087
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:39,840
Let's go.

2088
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:48,560
So close.

2089
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:50,040
I can get it.

2090
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:50,720
Wait, where did it go?

2091
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:52,020
No, I did get it.

2092
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,420
I'm so good.

2093
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,260
Oh, it's back there.

2094
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:54,980
Just kidding.

2095
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:55,140
No.

2096
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,840
I almost ran past it.

2097
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:07,100
Not good influence.

2098
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:09,080
Not good influence.

2099
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:22,550
Let me out.

2100
02:10:23,470 --> 02:10:24,590
Oh, it's this guy again.

2101
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:25,430
OK, we got this.

2102
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:34,640
I'm gonna run out of all my stuff.

2103
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,860
I'm trying not to... There we go.

2104
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:57,910
Get my stuff.

2105
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:07,800
Hit him with your ultimate!

2106
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,940
Shouldn't I save that?

2107
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,040
I guess we could.

2108
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,700
Wait, where's my ultimate?

2109
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:18,060
Wow!

2110
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:22,700
Wait, I was thinking of the other one.

2111
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,780
I actually didn't know about Bumblebees.

2112
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,240
Let's go.

2113
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:29,860
That was crazy.

2114
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:40,790
I'm gonna say Mint is gonna start pulling on the curtains when she wants something.

2115
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:42,430
What are you talking about?

2116
02:11:42,490 --> 02:11:43,330
I'm not a cat.

2117
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:48,190
Unless you want me to be.

2118
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:51,610
I'm not a cat.

2119
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:54,390
Do you want me to be?

2120
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:01,230
I guess I could have opened this.

2121
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:02,930
Am I gonna get shot at?

2122
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:04,370
No!

2123
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:11,780
Oops!

2124
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:14,120
Oh, it's these guys.

2125
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:17,460
Bye!

2126
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:27,150
I did this in sub-optimal order apparently.

2127
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:29,850
Since we are having to go all the way over here now.

2128
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:30,910
Oh gosh!

2129
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:40,370
I gotta shoot them.

2130
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:41,130
Oh my god!

2131
02:12:44,610 --> 02:12:45,230
Nevermind!

2132
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,620
I got one.

2133
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:06,920
Oh shoot.

2134
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:09,600
Oh shoot.

2135
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,280
Grab, grab, grabby, grab, grab!

2136
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:17,020
Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab!

2137
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:20,080
Got him.

2138
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:28,320
I tried to... I pressed... Actually at the same moment I pressed the... What's it called?

2139
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,240
The slide.

2140
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:33,620
Oh shoot.

2141
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:44,520
Thank you.

2142
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:46,660
Thank you.

2143
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,720
Get our money back.

2144
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:53,720
So if I go over here...

2145
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:00,990
So we could enter here.

2146
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:03,250
I could like switch out characters whenever I feel like it.

2147
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:04,030
That's so awesome.

2148
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:19,570
Or we drive through here.

2149
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:21,710
We have... Oh!

2150
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:24,450
We have an ambush?

2151
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:30,970
I was trying to grab that first.

2152
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:32,890
What was this thing?

2153
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:36,930
Up there.

2154
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:40,310
OK.

2155
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,330
Where?

2156
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:42,730
Oh!

2157
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:47,750
Time to vent.

2158
02:14:48,110 --> 02:14:48,730
We got it.

2159
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:52,240
Go, go, go!

2160
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,840
Go, go, go, go!

2161
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,660
Oh there is one here too?

2162
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,280
Oh it's... Wait.

2163
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:03,160
It's on the other side?

2164
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:15,900
These guys again.

2165
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,500
Oh gosh!

2166
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:18,240
These guys again.

2167
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:22,460
OK.

2168
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:48,700
Let's go.

2169
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:55,360
Again?

2170
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:02,560
We should do that too.

2171
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:03,980
It's the fear.

2172
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,700
Oh there!

2173
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:10,520
Megatron!

2174
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:13,560
Oh my god!

2175
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,920
Am I all by myself?

2176
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,160
What happened to my team?

2177
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,660
Where are you guys?

2178
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:21,420
Hello!

2179
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:23,960
Oh shit!

2180
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:25,960
I

2181
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,800
did not dodge fast enough.

2182
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:43,730
The music is so insane!

2183
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:57,730
I don't know what weapon I...

2184
02:17:03,470 --> 02:17:04,710
Oh my gosh!

2185
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:05,710
Devastator!

2186
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:07,450
It's kind of insane!

2187
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:09,270
OK.

2188
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:12,670
Nice suit.

2189
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,300
Oh my god!

2190
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,060
OK.

2191
02:17:30,410 --> 02:17:31,590
Oh too soon.

2192
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:42,310
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2193
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:44,050
Get me out of here!

2194
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:46,850
Holy shit!

2195
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:56,690
I'm punching him!

2196
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:57,430
I'm punching!

2197
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,710
And I'm attacking!

2198
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:01,850
Oh no!

2199
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:04,950
Oh damn!

2200
02:18:05,170 --> 02:18:06,170
Oh that really hurt!

2201
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:13,170
That really hurt!

2202
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,290
Oh my god!

2203
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:16,850
Oh my god!

2204
02:18:16,970 --> 02:18:17,610
Oh my god!

2205
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:31,640
I'm stuck!

2206
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:32,240
Oh my god!

2207
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:38,640
Phase 2?

2208
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:39,960
Oh my god, no.

2209
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:41,480
No!

2210
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:49,080
Guys,

2211
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,460
I'm in trouble I think.

2212
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,300
Oh my

2213
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:04,180
god!

2214
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:05,320
No!

2215
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:08,980
What?

2216
02:19:18,290 --> 02:19:20,970
The second phase is gnarly!

2217
02:19:21,770 --> 02:19:23,410
Oh they put you at the second phase.

2218
02:19:23,550 --> 02:19:24,990
That's so kind of them.

2219
02:19:25,970 --> 02:19:27,050
This game owns!

2220
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:30,630
Where is my health at though?

2221
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:41,880
Wowie!

2222
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:42,320
Wowie!

2223
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:42,860
Wowie!

2224
02:19:55,610 --> 02:19:56,790
Now I know what to expect.

2225
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:04,960
Oh he's so close though.

2226
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,400
I'm out of, I'm out of.

2227
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,140
Oh wait, now I got blasters.

2228
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:13,100
Oh shoot.

2229
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,560
Oh shit.

2230
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:25,520
Oh gosh!

2231
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:26,420
I don't have anything else!

2232
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:34,290
I'm just punching at this point.

2233
02:20:35,470 --> 02:20:36,570
I'm just punching!

2234
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:40,230
Oh my gosh I ran right into his fist.

2235
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:48,060
Oh he's down!

2236
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:48,380
He's down!

2237
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:48,800
He's down!

2238
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:52,320
Take him out!

2239
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:57,300
Take him out!

2240
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:02,480
Beneath the Earth?

2241
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:12,960
That wasn't so bad actually.

2242
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:34,520
Well, well.

2243
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,200
Bye

2244
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:53,810
bye Earth.

2245
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:58,550
Check your heals and boosts and ammo recoveries from the selected prize menu.

2246
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:00,730
I have those?

2247
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:02,170
Oh you guys can see my score.

2248
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:02,810
That's embarrassing.

2249
02:22:04,650 --> 02:22:05,230
Yay!

2250
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:06,290
We did chapter one!

2251
02:22:06,750 --> 02:22:07,750
How many chapters are there?

2252
02:22:12,570 --> 02:22:14,050
C gets degrees.

2253
02:22:16,270 --> 02:22:17,930
We got his drills!

2254
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:22,730
Six chapters.

2255
02:22:22,730 --> 02:22:22,850
Blasters.

2256
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:29,480
Everybody is saying, you guys don't know anything.

2257
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:32,540
Everybody is saying different stuff.

2258
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,780
Everybody is saying something different.

2259
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:42,240
I'm going to look it up myself.

2260
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:52,210
Transformers.

2261
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:55,830
Devastation.

2262
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:04,140
I don't trust the AI over here.

2263
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:05,100
Seven chapters.

2264
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:06,840
Again.

2265
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:11,770
Skip this.

2266
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,480
Wheeljack can now be selected as a playable character.

2267
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:27,220
Wait, we have not...

2268
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:28,540
Follow me.

2269
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:33,640
We didn't get to play as him before.

2270
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:40,220
Mechatron must be stopped.

2271
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,360
I really do like playing as Bumblebee.

2272
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:43,860
Let's see.

2273
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:45,580
But he is so tiny.

2274
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:48,780
It's hard for weapons for him maybe.

2275
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:50,860
Maybe.

2276
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:52,180
Let's see.

2277
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:54,480
Can you get the...

2278
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:56,360
He can't get the drills though.

2279
02:24:00,590 --> 02:24:03,030
He can get the drills though.

2280
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:08,950
Maybe we switch out from the blasters.

2281
02:24:11,290 --> 02:24:12,130
Or no.

2282
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:15,450
Will he still be so fast even with the drills?

2283
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:19,730
Run!

2284
02:24:19,850 --> 02:24:20,630
Thanks for the fine gift.

2285
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:21,630
Thank you.

2286
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:23,330
Now he is a real Bumblebee.

2287
02:24:24,570 --> 02:24:25,250
He's got...

2288
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:27,830
He's got stingers.

2289
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:32,370
I was wondering, who must be stopped again?

2290
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:35,470
Megatron must be stopped.

2291
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:38,590
Cool.

2292
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:40,090
Can we switch out the blasters?

2293
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:42,390
Maybe we get something...

2294
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,730
A little... Okay, energon attack.

2295
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:45,250
Let's see.

2296
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:45,550
Okay.

2297
02:24:46,410 --> 02:24:47,230
What was that?

2298
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:52,010
It has a better attack power and stuff.

2299
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:52,750
But what's...

2300
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:54,810
This one is overall better in every way.

2301
02:24:54,890 --> 02:24:55,670
So let's do that.

2302
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:58,390
I don't think we have anything...

2303
02:24:59,810 --> 02:25:01,210
Gosh, look at that thing.

2304
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:02,150
It's craziness.

2305
02:25:02,490 --> 02:25:04,570
We could do the...

2306
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:06,750
The twin...

2307
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:08,230
We could actually become Raiden.

2308
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:11,570
Take out the trash.

2309
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:12,430
I think of Naomi.

2310
02:25:23,700 --> 02:25:25,860
Maybe we should actually become Raiden.

2311
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:28,160
And then we can get rid of...

2312
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:29,480
The basic machine gun.

2313
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:31,060
And we'll put in the shock blaster.

2314
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:33,280
That should be better.

2315
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:36,020
That should be better.

2316
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:38,720
Synthesize weapons.

2317
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:40,580
I can make even...

2318
02:25:40,580 --> 02:25:42,440
Will this level stuff up too?

2319
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:44,260
I wonder.

2320
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,760
Because if I really like something...

2321
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,180
I'd like to...

2322
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:49,900
Like the drills.

2323
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:51,120
The drills are really good.

2324
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:52,680
We can use it to level up.

2325
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,520
Let's just pick something dinky.

2326
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:00,260
Something kind of poopy.

2327
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:02,420
Like this.

2328
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:04,540
I don't know.

2329
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:09,190
Like this.

2330
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:12,870
Create the weapon shown.

2331
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:16,150
So it just adds to its level, right?

2332
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:19,970
Oh,

2333
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:28,550
and it costs money!

2334
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:32,170
Good to know.

2335
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:33,430
Okay.

2336
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:34,790
Alright, alright.

2337
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:35,910
It didn't really do much.

2338
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:37,530
It didn't even level it up.

2339
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:38,310
That's okay, that's okay.

2340
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:39,350
I just wanted to see what happened.

2341
02:26:42,090 --> 02:26:42,450
Attack!

2342
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:44,630
Wait.

2343
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:45,630
No.

2344
02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:46,750
What was it?

2345
02:26:47,490 --> 02:26:49,130
I think it was like the buy weapons.

2346
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,430
So we can synthesize them.

2347
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:52,190
Oh, the lab.

2348
02:26:52,270 --> 02:26:52,910
There we go, there we go.

2349
02:26:53,490 --> 02:26:53,850
Buy.

2350
02:26:54,510 --> 02:26:57,030
Wait, I can also sell stuff for better things.

2351
02:26:57,170 --> 02:26:59,350
Yeah, we can sell the dinky stuff.

2352
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:06,580
Every rank D.

2353
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:07,560
Goodbye.

2354
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:10,460
Because I think it's...

2355
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,260
Well, we don't get much money from this either.

2356
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:14,680
I wonder what's worth more.

2357
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:17,640
Synthesizing it or selling it.

2358
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:23,440
I watched your stream for the first time today.

2359
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:25,220
I was fascinated by your creativity and cuteness.

2360
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:26,320
Let me support you from Japan.

2361
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:27,500
I'm sorry for my bad English.

2362
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:28,280
No!

2363
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:30,480
Your English is so good!

2364
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:32,880
Misuzu-san, thank you!

2365
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:34,660
I'm happy.

2366
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:36,440
Thank you.

2367
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:40,360
Your English is perfect.

2368
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:45,500
I'm sorry for my bad Japanese.

2369
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:50,780
Thank you.

2370
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,820
Timicus Prime, thanks for the super chat!

2371
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:01,260
Thank you.

2372
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:03,180
Okay.

2373
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:04,980
Let's just keep going.

2374
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:09,720
I'll become a bigger brain with this later, maybe.

2375
02:28:14,130 --> 02:28:16,520
The music in this game is so good.

2376
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:24,320
Everyone is so nice.

2377
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:27,460
Everybody is so nice.

2378
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:28,240
Good morning!

2379
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,380
Everybody is so nice.

2380
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:34,140
Okay!

2381
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:36,540
Okay, okay.

2382
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,340
That surprised me!

2383
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:41,780
Optimus has thick fingers.

2384
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:46,320
Oh no.

2385
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:57,080
That's me.

2386
02:28:59,380 --> 02:29:04,120
On my way!

2387
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,060
Oh wait.

2388
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:12,470
Alright.

2389
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:13,870
Was there anything else in here?

2390
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:15,150
Sorry, I just want to check real quick.

2391
02:29:17,910 --> 02:29:19,630
It does not seem to be the case.

2392
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:29,090
Can I destroy these?

2393
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,060
Okay.

2394
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:48,270
Damn.

2395
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:51,290
I want to try the drills out.

2396
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:55,850
Holy cow.

2397
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:57,030
We already got him.

2398
02:29:58,850 --> 02:30:00,710
If you were a transformer, which would you...

2399
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:03,810
I

2400
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:08,420
want to get the stuff.

2401
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:17,480
How much damage...

2402
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:18,160
Oh, okay.

2403
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:19,860
It's not bad at all.

2404
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,480
Just a little bit more.

2405
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:26,140
You can charge with a heavy?

2406
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:26,800
No.

2407
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,380
Learn, thank you.

2408
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:51,260
Okay.

2409
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:57,320
I went the wrong way.

2410
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:05,510
I didn't notice that there was a...

2411
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:10,960
I can't see.

2412
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,260
I can't see anything.

2413
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:19,240
Wait, wait, wait.

2414
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,840
Wait, wait.

2415
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:22,780
There is a thing down here.

2416
02:31:26,650 --> 02:31:27,090
Again?

2417
02:31:27,890 --> 02:31:29,170
Wait, didn't we get this one before?

2418
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:32,830
We can get it again?

2419
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:34,150
Over and over again?

2420
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:35,170
We can farm materials.

2421
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:41,180
Let's go.

2422
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:43,060
I'll take it.

2423
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:43,660
And also here.

2424
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,200
The drills are very cute.

2425
02:31:54,040 --> 02:31:55,320
Farm away.

2426
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:59,840
And we get ambushed here.

2427
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:10,010
By some...

2428
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,030
Oh

2429
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:41,770
damn, I totally fumbled that.

2430
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:54,390
I missed the back attack.

2431
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:59,520
I missed the back attack.

2432
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:03,120
The deadliest weapon of all, Minto driving.

2433
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:04,880
You would trust me.

2434
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:09,140
You would trust me as your Uber driver, right?

2435
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:24,350
What do you mean?

2436
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:28,090
Roadkill.

2437
02:33:31,790 --> 02:33:32,730
What are these?

2438
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:37,420
Okay.

2439
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,510
How do I use my...

2440
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:46,830
Ah!

2441
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,690
If I want to use the swords, I can.

2442
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:52,890
If I want to use the drills, I can.

2443
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:54,210
So it's... Okay, okay.

2444
02:33:56,310 --> 02:33:57,210
Understand, understand.

2445
02:34:03,610 --> 02:34:04,770
Why did I do that?

2446
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:06,750
I'm styling.

2447
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:10,450
Stream and shop 50% off today for snakes and autobots.

2448
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:13,210
If only.

2449
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:19,750
There's no discounts for transformers apparently.

2450
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:25,690
What's the yellow mean?

2451
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:29,870
Oh, it's windy.

2452
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:30,490
That's why.

2453
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:32,870
I see, I see.

2454
02:34:36,650 --> 02:34:37,890
I can make it!

2455
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,410
Oh!

2456
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:40,610
I can't make it!

2457
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:41,870
Ah!

2458
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:46,070
I should have just shot it.

2459
02:34:48,110 --> 02:34:49,630
Is this thing gonna come down?

2460
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:54,850
This thing is scary.

2461
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:59,590
But they give me some... Only 5 bucks.

2462
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:08,030
What the?

2463
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:09,070
Oh my gosh, the seekers.

2464
02:35:09,070 --> 02:35:09,150
Seekers.

2465
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,830
There's more?

2466
02:35:33,090 --> 02:35:34,170
Give me your money.

2467
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:36,690
I got him.

2468
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:38,670
Give me the loot.

2469
02:35:39,310 --> 02:35:41,030
Does this game get 5 big booms?

2470
02:35:41,670 --> 02:35:42,210
Boom!

2471
02:35:42,570 --> 02:35:42,850
Boom!

2472
02:35:43,530 --> 02:35:44,130
Boom!

2473
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:45,010
Boom!

2474
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:46,270
Look at you, so chill.

2475
02:35:46,570 --> 02:35:47,410
Boom, boom!

2476
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:51,670
Wait, that was 6 big booms.

2477
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:54,470
I think this game deserves 6 big booms.

2478
02:36:01,370 --> 02:36:02,050
Information.

2479
02:36:03,470 --> 02:36:04,510
Log info.

2480
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:09,370
Nothing over here, right?

2481
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:12,710
There's a different way we can go, but...

2482
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:13,790
Oh my god!

2483
02:36:15,010 --> 02:36:15,830
Oh god!

2484
02:36:18,310 --> 02:36:19,770
I did not live.

2485
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:21,630
I did not live.

2486
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:28,100
Wait, I need to go back through it.

2487
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:29,900
Go back and...

2488
02:36:41,410 --> 02:36:42,750
We booming now?

2489
02:36:45,110 --> 02:36:50,590
Someone who beat this game on prime difficulty, I'm happy seeing other people playing this game.

2490
02:36:51,070 --> 02:36:53,910
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

2491
02:36:54,930 --> 02:36:55,770
Enjoying the stream?

2492
02:36:55,850 --> 02:36:56,510
Keep up the great work!

2493
02:36:56,610 --> 02:36:57,850
Thanks GLaDOS!

2494
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:59,310
I appreciate it.

2495
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:01,910
I like how we're just like a little...

2496
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:03,890
Buggy car.

2497
02:37:06,430 --> 02:37:07,410
Melee rare.

2498
02:37:11,340 --> 02:37:12,720
What are these things?

2499
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:19,100
Yeah, it's...

2500
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:20,500
It's insanity now.

2501
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:26,600
Oh...

2502
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,760
Oh, I just realized there was a jumping...

2503
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:35,820
There was a little jumping fire guy earlier and I forgot to grab him afterwards.

2504
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:38,460
Shoot.

2505
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:44,000
He was like, I saw him during a boss fight and I forgot to go back and get him.

2506
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:44,780
That's okay though.

2507
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,620
Kremzik, I can't remember their names at all.

2508
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:50,460
Ouch!

2509
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,160
Sorry, depth perception.

2510
02:38:07,970 --> 02:38:09,130
Where?

2511
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:11,670
He's here!

2512
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:31,850
He's here!

2513
02:38:31,850 --> 02:38:35,050
This is bad.

2514
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:36,710
This is bad.

2515
02:38:38,250 --> 02:38:40,670
What the hell?

2516
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:41,810
What did I...

2517
02:38:41,810 --> 02:38:42,950
I'm completely out!

2518
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:48,700
Refocus!

2519
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:05,280
Oh, when did I attach the sword?

2520
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:11,780
Where'd it go?

2521
02:39:16,230 --> 02:39:17,330
Oh, I see it.

2522
02:39:20,350 --> 02:39:22,470
It's passing beneath me.

2523
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:35,900
I need more materials, I think.

2524
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:44,510
Oh shoot.

2525
02:39:45,730 --> 02:39:46,630
Sentry boy!

2526
02:39:47,450 --> 02:39:48,090
What's his health?

2527
02:39:48,210 --> 02:39:49,090
Oh, it's halfway there.

2528
02:39:49,530 --> 02:39:51,950
Did I get it?

2529
02:39:52,010 --> 02:39:52,150
No.

2530
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:54,170
Dang it.

2531
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:01,440
Okay, that was big damage.

2532
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:02,500
Oh shoot.

2533
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:18,720
We got the door open.

2534
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:23,680
Time to go inside.

2535
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:44,560
Where's the last guy?

2536
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:46,380
Where are you, coward?

2537
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:47,940
Show your face.

2538
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,220
Oh, there's three things down here.

2539
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:54,220
He fell down here.

2540
02:40:58,700 --> 02:40:59,660
He's gone.

2541
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:02,060
It's my birthday!

2542
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:06,400
Thanks for giving me motivation while I did a bunch of cleaning I've been putting off.

2543
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:09,220
Mr. Frisco, are you working on your birthday?

2544
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:10,620
Not allowed?

2545
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:11,460
Not okay?

2546
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:12,200
Oh no!

2547
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:14,820
Let me sing you happy birthday.

2548
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:18,540
Happy birthday to you!

2549
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:19,980
Happy birthday to you!

2550
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:21,860
Happy birthday, Mr. Frisco!

2551
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:30,300
Happy birthday to you!

2552
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:50,700
There's more of them?

2553
02:42:01,210 --> 02:42:01,730
Yah!

2554
02:42:03,730 --> 02:42:05,170
Oh wait!

2555
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:11,040
Oh shoot.

2556
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:12,660
I missed my chance.

2557
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:15,160
Yah!

2558
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:16,460
Yah!

2559
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:19,940
Their drills are really powerful.

2560
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,920
Their drills are really good!

2561
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:26,960
Nice dude.

2562
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:27,240
Dude.

2563
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:33,900
Walking into history, are you?

2564
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:38,420
Alright, don't let our stuff despawn now, Bumblebee.

2565
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:42,140
Nice.

2566
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:43,220
Okay.

2567
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:47,980
He ain't even out of breath.

2568
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:48,660
I know!

2569
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,820
You're not about to breathe?

2570
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:01,500
Sometimes.

2571
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:04,820
Woo!

2572
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:07,260
Ranged unclamoring!

2573
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:11,960
They have pistons.

2574
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,560
Repair kit.

2575
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:22,300
What was... Someone said like... Not main menu.

2576
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:29,880
But I have like healing items and stuff like that?

2577
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:34,990
Select?

2578
02:43:38,570 --> 02:43:39,650
This is the same thing.

2579
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:43,370
Select or touch pad.

2580
02:43:44,890 --> 02:43:45,330
Ah!

2581
02:43:45,870 --> 02:43:46,530
I see, I see.

2582
02:43:47,370 --> 02:43:48,850
I'm on my PS5, sorry.

2583
02:44:02,570 --> 02:44:04,350
I see, I see, I see.

2584
02:44:04,950 --> 02:44:06,470
Increases attack by... Wow!

2585
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:07,350
Power booster!

2586
02:44:10,230 --> 02:44:10,850
Might be?

2587
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:11,470
It's okay.

2588
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:12,310
How would you have known?

2589
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:17,490
How would you have known that I was playing on my PS5?

2590
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:25,640
I always forget about the touch pad, I'm not gonna lie.

2591
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:26,880
Because I... What?

2592
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:28,520
What games do I use it in?

2593
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:31,260
Not even in Astro Bot!

2594
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:35,180
We gotta play the new Astro Bot DLC.

2595
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:41,480
Forgot the items existed.

2596
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:50,920
It can't be!

2597
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:55,680
You mean an Autobot ship is responsible for all the destruction in the city?

2598
02:44:58,120 --> 02:44:59,740
It appears so, Wheeljack.

2599
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:04,100
But I doubt it was an Autobot hand that caused the destruction.

2600
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:06,640
Another Cybertronian ship crashed on Earth?

2601
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:07,820
What are the odds?

2602
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:08,840
What are the odds?

2603
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:11,540
What are the odds?

2604
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:24,260
The colonnade is comprised of the essential aspects of our lost Cybertronian heritage.

2605
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,260
And it was placed inside the Ferotaxis.

2606
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:32,380
The supercomputer that controls the Proud Star.

2607
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:38,280
The Ferotaxis literally carries our culture inside of it.

2608
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,500
What an historical find that would be!

2609
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:44,740
So much art and beauty and history has been lost to find it again.

2610
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:47,780
So much art and beauty.

2611
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:51,740
The Ferotaxis controls both the Plasma Core and the Insecticons.

2612
02:45:52,060 --> 02:45:56,040
It directs the power and gives the Insecticons their function and purpose.

2613
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:58,580
Ok, so we find the Ferotaxis and what?

2614
02:45:58,860 --> 02:45:59,560
Destroy it?

2615
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:01,980
It's got so much of our culture in it.

2616
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:03,660
We can't do that, can we?

2617
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:04,340
Our culture!

2618
02:46:04,940 --> 02:46:05,980
No, we can't.

2619
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:08,340
We find the Plasma Core and shut it down.

2620
02:46:08,660 --> 02:46:12,800
Shutting down the power is the most surefire way to stop the cyberforming.

2621
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:16,900
Then we locate the Ferotaxis and preserve our culture.

2622
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:19,300
As Nova Prime intended.

2623
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:23,100
But for now, stay focused.

2624
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:25,500
There are more floors to this ship.

2625
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:28,580
We split up and locate the Plasma Core.

2626
02:46:31,140 --> 02:46:32,000
Split up gang!

2627
02:46:35,910 --> 02:46:37,390
Alright.

2628
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:45,720
Yeah, where are they going?

2629
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:46,900
Hello.

2630
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:52,820
Oh no?

2631
02:46:56,660 --> 02:46:57,980
Ok.

2632
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:09,580
Oh.

2633
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:11,900
Ominous much?

2634
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:21,040
Let's grab this yummy over here.

2635
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:23,180
I like how you can see through the windows.

2636
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:23,960
It looks so cool.

2637
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:29,620
Like you can see through...

2638
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:29,880
Hey!

2639
02:47:30,260 --> 02:47:31,760
Little... quit bugging me!

2640
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:34,060
Get it?

2641
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:38,800
Probably too high level of a joke for you guys to understand though.

2642
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:52,980
I know you like it.

2643
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:54,860
Thank you.

2644
02:47:58,330 --> 02:47:59,270
Let's see.

2645
02:48:02,310 --> 02:48:03,470
Enter the Ark?

2646
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:03,690
Yeah.

2647
02:48:04,470 --> 02:48:05,790
Let's enter the Ark!

2648
02:48:06,250 --> 02:48:07,550
I'm not smart.

2649
02:48:09,810 --> 02:48:10,690
Let's skip.

2650
02:48:15,890 --> 02:48:19,030
I want to use this, but only Optimus can.

2651
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:21,150
It sells for a good amount though.

2652
02:48:22,230 --> 02:48:24,290
It's probably super slow too.

2653
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:34,100
Lightning sword.

2654
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:37,520
True, true Raiden fashion.

2655
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:40,280
Let's see.

2656
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:40,320
Let's see.

2657
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:46,600
I feel like tech is good to get, right?

2658
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:48,460
Like right now...

2659
02:48:48,460 --> 02:48:51,920
We only have two slots, but can we make more slots?

2660
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:55,440
I'm going to try again.

2661
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:55,900
Develop.

2662
02:48:58,220 --> 02:48:58,500
Ok.

2663
02:48:58,500 --> 02:48:58,560
Ok.

2664
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:09,060
All in?

2665
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:10,320
All in!

2666
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:11,980
That sounds like something for me, baby!

2667
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:14,720
What did I get?

2668
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:15,160
Wait.

2669
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:23,420
Increases amount health recovers and increases resistance to status effects.

2670
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:27,320
I like our enhanced radar, but...

2671
02:49:30,820 --> 02:49:31,860
All in!

2672
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:35,940
We can play blackjack in this?

2673
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:39,100
We got like a nice... It's so rare.

2674
02:49:39,240 --> 02:49:40,120
And damage down.

2675
02:49:43,540 --> 02:49:46,340
Maybe the status guard one will switch out.

2676
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,860
Because melee attack up is good too.

2677
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:54,320
And if we are taking less damage, maybe we don't need to heal more.

2678
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:57,920
Ok.

2679
02:49:58,160 --> 02:49:59,020
I'm feeling lucky.

2680
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:00,440
I'm feeling lucky.

2681
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:18,430
I shouldn't feel lucky.

2682
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:24,030
I wish I get a refund.

2683
02:50:26,990 --> 02:50:29,930
Guys, I got to go to the little ghost's room real quick.

2684
02:50:31,570 --> 02:50:32,090
Oh, no.

2685
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:32,650
That's not.

2686
02:50:32,750 --> 02:50:32,990
Sorry.

2687
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:35,250
Ready, ready, ready.

2688
02:50:35,730 --> 02:50:36,230
One second.

2689
02:50:37,410 --> 02:50:38,350
I'll be just a minute.

2690
02:50:55,810 --> 02:50:56,870
Murphy, you're too early.

2691
02:53:09,330 --> 02:53:10,230
Sorry about that.

2692
02:53:10,330 --> 02:53:11,610
I didn't realize what time it was.

2693
02:53:11,670 --> 02:53:12,730
I had to feed my cats too.

2694
02:53:14,010 --> 02:53:15,130
It's dinner time.

2695
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:16,310
Alright.

2696
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:17,930
Welcome back.

2697
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:18,430
Thank you.

2698
02:53:22,190 --> 02:53:23,010
Okey dokey.

2699
02:53:25,650 --> 02:53:26,590
Dinner time.

2700
02:53:26,930 --> 02:53:27,530
What's for dinner?

2701
02:53:28,030 --> 02:53:29,570
A sensitive stomach?

2702
02:53:31,710 --> 02:53:32,670
Return to gameplay.

2703
02:53:32,850 --> 02:53:33,050
Yes.

2704
02:53:33,350 --> 02:53:33,550
Alright.

2705
02:53:33,770 --> 02:53:34,510
Let's just go for it.

2706
02:53:35,190 --> 02:53:35,750
Did you wash your hands?

2707
02:53:35,810 --> 02:53:36,370
I always do.

2708
02:53:36,530 --> 02:53:37,970
You don't even have to ask.

2709
02:53:38,750 --> 02:53:40,670
I always wash my hands.

2710
02:53:40,970 --> 02:53:42,030
Is there anything like around?

2711
02:53:43,210 --> 02:53:43,470
Nope.

2712
02:53:43,910 --> 02:53:44,970
There is invisible wall.

2713
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:47,330
Die bug.

2714
02:53:48,330 --> 02:53:49,150
Die bug.

2715
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:54,050
Starscream 1.

2716
02:53:59,250 --> 02:53:59,970
Files.

2717
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:01,710
Info logs.

2718
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:07,500
What is a Cybertronian?

2719
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:12,700
Cybertronians are robotic aliens from the distant planet of Cybertron.

2720
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:17,400
These robots have the ability to alter their shapes, changing modes into vehicles.

2721
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:22,980
Each Cybertronian, with rare exceptions, can take on one alternate mode.

2722
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:30,480
As far back as many as their memories stretch, two distinct factions of Cybertronians have been locked in a constant and terrible war.

2723
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:32,880
Thanks for the super chat you guys.

2724
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:33,760
Thank you.

2725
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:37,540
Megatron.

2726
02:54:38,420 --> 02:54:46,260
It is apparent that neither Megatron nor his Decepticon lieutenants knew for certain what was happening to the city, nor what lies beneath it.

2727
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:50,680
However, Megatron's memory of the Golden Age is clearer than most Cybertronians.

2728
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:56,940
And so it appears that he suspected that plasma energy was one of the causes of the city's destruction.

2729
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:00,260
Megatron's suspicions were confirmed.

2730
02:55:00,820 --> 02:55:04,820
The ship he now controls is indeed the proud star of legend.

2731
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:05,940
Commentary.

2732
02:55:06,100 --> 02:55:10,080
It must be a perverse kind of joy that Megatron now feels.

2733
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:21,480
Knowing that the instrument of Earth's destruction was an Autobot invention and Autobot mission.

2734
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,840
What a perverse kind of joy.

2735
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:28,840
At least they're honest about it.

2736
02:55:33,820 --> 02:55:36,240
Oh, there's a voice playback.

2737
02:55:40,080 --> 02:55:41,820
Indeed, the proud star of legend.

2738
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:42,660
Commentary.

2739
02:55:43,380 --> 02:55:46,400
It must be a perverse kind of joy that Megatron now feels.

2740
02:55:47,020 --> 02:55:52,260
Knowing that the instrument of Earth's destruction was an Autobot invention and Autobot mission.

2741
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:57,680
Observation.

2742
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:02,820
Starscream's anger, Starscream's constant annoyance with Megatron appears to be heightened.

2743
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:06,800
As is the tension with his fellow Seekers, Thundercracker and Skywarp.

2744
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:10,940
It appears that the recent rise in tensions surrounds the search for the plasma core.

2745
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:17,900
Starscream is perhaps feeling that he is being underused and Thundercracker feeling that plasma energy is too dangerous.

2746
02:56:18,180 --> 02:56:25,280
It is likely that Starscream will berate Thundercracker for his apparent cowardice while secretly fearing destruction himself by way of the plasma core.

2747
02:56:25,300 --> 02:56:26,620
He's such a little coward.

2748
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:29,220
Starscream, silly guy.

2749
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:29,540
Okay.

2750
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:36,300
We're searching.

2751
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:41,780
We're continuing.

2752
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:04,320
Oh my gosh.

2753
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:09,060
Oh shoot.

2754
02:57:23,140 --> 02:57:25,540
I don't know why I drove right into that.

2755
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:27,340
I'm trying to dodge.

2756
02:57:41,710 --> 02:57:43,530
I can't tell what he's saying.

2757
02:57:44,170 --> 02:57:44,850
What are you saying?

2758
02:57:45,030 --> 02:57:45,550
Oh shoot.

2759
02:57:56,320 --> 02:57:57,120
Got him.

2760
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:01,040
Soundwave superior.

2761
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:07,540
Abort mission.

2762
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:10,780
Bye Soundwave!

2763
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:11,760
Silly guy.

2764
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:25,020
Okay.

2765
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:28,740
We go to the plasma core and disable it.

2766
02:58:29,240 --> 02:58:33,780
The ferrotoxis has the sum total of Cybertronian culture recorded within.

2767
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:38,060
If at all possible, we must preserve it.

2768
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:38,860
Oh, there's a second one.

2769
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:56,560
Pull triangle then release it fires a drill.

2770
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:57,880
Oh yeah, yeah, the charge up.

2771
02:58:57,940 --> 02:58:58,340
Yeah, yeah.

2772
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:01,820
Yes, I gotta remember to do that.

2773
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:03,160
Yeah!

2774
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:06,260
Is it above or below?

2775
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:13,760
Oh my gosh, look you can see the Megatron logo.

2776
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:16,200
No, it definitely can't be below.

2777
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:17,940
Weird.

2778
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:20,020
It's my spawn day!

2779
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:22,660
Can you wish me a happy birthday Metal Gear Solid version?

2780
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:23,660
Osu no!

2781
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:24,560
Happy birthday!

2782
02:59:25,560 --> 02:59:27,320
Happy birthday.

2783
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:28,160
Congratulations.

2784
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:33,040
Happy birthday with salutations.

2785
02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:34,860
Happy birthday.

2786
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:37,360
May your sky stay blue.

2787
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:41,260
Happy birthday to you.

2788
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:42,960
Happy birthday Osu no!

2789
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:44,740
Above?

2790
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:47,200
Above?

2791
02:59:50,300 --> 02:59:51,420
Above?

2792
02:59:58,550 --> 02:59:59,730
I don't know.

2793
03:00:00,050 --> 03:00:01,390
I mean we did get one here.

2794
03:00:02,090 --> 03:00:03,370
Maybe it's bugged.

2795
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:10,850
Oh, this thing.

2796
03:00:19,580 --> 03:00:21,960
Some transversal cruisers have short...

2797
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:25,280
You bugged?

2798
03:00:25,420 --> 03:00:25,680
A pun?

2799
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:27,780
Not this time.

2800
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:35,900
Ew.

2801
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,440
Anything over here?

2802
03:00:39,640 --> 03:00:41,600
Nope, this is bugged.

2803
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:44,860
Matara would love this place.

2804
03:00:50,010 --> 03:00:53,290
Look, these guys are like moonwalking.

2805
03:00:53,750 --> 03:00:55,770
Ew, they're even on the machine!

2806
03:00:57,530 --> 03:00:58,610
Starscream 2.

2807
03:01:12,990 --> 03:01:14,230
What?

2808
03:01:14,830 --> 03:01:20,790
Oh, we'll follow who first on Twitter.

2809
03:01:24,030 --> 03:01:24,450
Not me.

2810
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:29,730
Those butts!

2811
03:01:36,030 --> 03:01:38,170
Regulate it to those butts!

2812
03:02:10,820 --> 03:02:15,100
I don't know who I just...

2813
03:02:23,140 --> 03:02:24,220
Anyway...

2814
03:02:24,220 --> 03:02:24,640
Oh...

2815
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,460
They gotta be kidding with that.

2816
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:34,800
Oh, we got our stats up.

2817
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:35,160
Cool.

2818
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:41,500
Chill out, bug.

2819
03:02:42,020 --> 03:02:43,800
Quit bugging out.

2820
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:46,260
Oh gosh, there's more?

2821
03:02:47,420 --> 03:02:47,920
He's

2822
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,520
already dead, but I can at least...

2823
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:10,840
Oh, there's some health over here.

2824
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:12,820
Yeah!

2825
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:16,100
Okay, we got our goods.

2826
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:17,240
We got the loot.

2827
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:32,680
My goods!

2828
03:03:47,970 --> 03:03:48,730
Nice.

2829
03:03:53,790 --> 03:03:54,890
Oh shoot!

2830
03:03:59,210 --> 03:03:59,990
Nice.

2831
03:04:05,490 --> 03:04:06,770
Oh come on!

2832
03:04:06,990 --> 03:04:07,610
Come on!

2833
03:04:07,930 --> 03:04:11,170
He's too...

2834
03:04:13,350 --> 03:04:15,730
He's too nimble.

2835
03:04:15,730 --> 03:04:16,790
Ouch!

2836
03:04:17,070 --> 03:04:21,050
I'm trying

2837
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,180
to get my stuff.

2838
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:27,000
I earned it!

2839
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:29,280
I earned my loot!

2840
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:36,360
Oh, so close with this guy.

2841
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:39,800
Nice.

2842
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:41,000
Alright.

2843
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:43,080
I think there's...

2844
03:04:53,580 --> 03:04:54,420
Please!

2845
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:54,620
Please!

2846
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:58,900
Oh my god, I can barely reach him.

2847
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:01,600
Maybe I should have switched to the long swords.

2848
03:05:03,020 --> 03:05:05,200
Maybe I should have switched to the long swords.

2849
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:09,660
Can I have the stuff that's on the ground?

2850
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:11,720
Over there!

2851
03:05:11,960 --> 03:05:12,300
Over there!

2852
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:12,980
Go grab it!

2853
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:18,120
Over here!

2854
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:19,940
Grab it.

2855
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:21,280
Nice.

2856
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:24,240
I think that's...

2857
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,560
All of it.

2858
03:05:33,180 --> 03:05:34,700
Get the loot!

2859
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:36,060
We get the loot!

2860
03:05:46,990 --> 03:05:48,090
Now that's everything.

2861
03:05:48,550 --> 03:05:50,450
Soundwave's VA is Frank Welker.

2862
03:05:51,130 --> 03:05:54,310
AKA the guy who voiced Freddy in most of Scooby-Doo.

2863
03:05:54,870 --> 03:05:56,730
Since the original... Oh my gosh.

2864
03:05:58,150 --> 03:05:58,830
Freddy!

2865
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:02,170
That guy...

2866
03:06:02,170 --> 03:06:03,670
That guy's so silly.

2867
03:06:07,410 --> 03:06:08,410
Hold on.

2868
03:06:10,150 --> 03:06:12,010
Oh, I thought we could... Wait.

2869
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:16,150
I thought for a second we could go in there.

2870
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:25,920
No!

2871
03:06:26,700 --> 03:06:29,760
It's just within our... Just beyond our grasp.

2872
03:06:33,540 --> 03:06:35,460
Freddy is Frank's natural voice too?

2873
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:37,840
That's great.

2874
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,980
Is this a puzzle?

2875
03:06:40,120 --> 03:06:41,880
What is this part actually?

2876
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:43,400
Enter?

2877
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:47,260
No, I think I'm okay right now.

2878
03:06:48,260 --> 03:06:49,420
With the side mission.

2879
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:51,040
I like it in here.

2880
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:51,880
I want to keep going.

2881
03:06:53,100 --> 03:06:53,460
Run!

2882
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:53,860
Run!

2883
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:54,160
Run!

2884
03:06:57,740 --> 03:06:59,560
Oh gosh, it's all time!

2885
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:01,920
Oh my gosh.

2886
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:07,160
No!

2887
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:07,920
No!

2888
03:07:08,220 --> 03:07:08,640
No!

2889
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:12,360
I missed it at the last second.

2890
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:17,440
We'll be visiting Japan in May.

2891
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:19,120
Thanks for the mileage recommendation.

2892
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:21,200
My wife is a big Steins Gate fan.

2893
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:22,780
I hope you enjoy it.

2894
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:25,780
The cafe is not usually ever that busy so...

2895
03:07:26,360 --> 03:07:33,160
It's usually pretty easy to get the seat where they sit at and everything too.

2896
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:39,780
Oh my gosh, that other one is such a red herring.

2897
03:07:42,820 --> 03:07:43,460
Seriously?

2898
03:08:07,130 --> 03:08:08,970
Oh wow, this is...

2899
03:08:11,150 --> 03:08:12,710
I could have gone better.

2900
03:08:14,090 --> 03:08:15,610
I could have gone better.

2901
03:08:28,360 --> 03:08:29,780
Them I-frames.

2902
03:08:30,380 --> 03:08:31,360
Thank goodness for them.

2903
03:08:32,480 --> 03:08:33,960
Who is still blasting?

2904
03:08:34,900 --> 03:08:36,480
Oh, he's in there somewhere.

2905
03:08:36,680 --> 03:08:37,320
Oh, there he is.

2906
03:08:45,560 --> 03:08:46,500
I got him.

2907
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:52,120
Wow, they are all in here!

2908
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:53,420
Bad news!

2909
03:09:04,480 --> 03:09:04,920
OK.

2910
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:09,380
Am I in the wrong area?

2911
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:10,600
Warning!

2912
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:16,120
Of course I...

2913
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:19,820
Wait, am I going the right way?

2914
03:09:22,120 --> 03:09:23,280
Is this the way you want me to go?

2915
03:09:26,320 --> 03:09:27,320
What is this?

2916
03:09:33,710 --> 03:09:34,850
What is this?

2917
03:09:35,870 --> 03:09:36,790
How mysterious.

2918
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:43,240
Go, go, go!

2919
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:45,080
Go, Bubbly!

2920
03:09:45,620 --> 03:09:47,520
Oh, we totally missed it.

2921
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:51,780
Now I'm back on the bottom floor.

2922
03:09:53,320 --> 03:09:55,000
Oh, it's side stuff.

2923
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:55,820
Shoot.

2924
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:58,520
I think that's where actually the...

2925
03:09:58,520 --> 03:09:58,960
What's it called?

2926
03:09:59,280 --> 03:10:05,940
The little area where I can...

2927
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:11,820
See the hidden...

2928
03:10:12,380 --> 03:10:13,300
Whatever it's called.

2929
03:10:14,740 --> 03:10:16,280
The orange thing on the map.

2930
03:10:20,700 --> 03:10:22,440
What else is down here though?

2931
03:10:22,800 --> 03:10:23,360
I'm just curious.

2932
03:10:25,820 --> 03:10:26,980
Or maybe we can get to it from here.

2933
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:29,580
Nope.

2934
03:10:30,120 --> 03:10:30,500
OK.

2935
03:10:30,660 --> 03:10:31,180
Turn around.

2936
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,460
What?

2937
03:10:37,540 --> 03:10:38,700
It's so tepid.

2938
03:10:39,540 --> 03:10:40,080
Alright!

2939
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:45,870
Thought this game got delisted.

2940
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:47,330
Yeah, I got it.

2941
03:10:47,910 --> 03:10:49,690
But it wasn't delisted.

2942
03:10:52,630 --> 03:10:54,310
I mean, maybe you could find...

2943
03:10:54,310 --> 03:10:55,730
I wonder if you found like...

2944
03:10:55,730 --> 03:10:59,830
Well, probably it would be so expensive if you found like a physical copy...

2945
03:10:59,830 --> 03:11:01,550
At like a...

2946
03:11:01,550 --> 03:11:02,290
What's it called?

2947
03:11:05,410 --> 03:11:07,090
A used game store or something.

2948
03:11:07,390 --> 03:11:10,050
Those kinds of places would probably...

2949
03:11:10,050 --> 03:11:10,650
Hike it up.

2950
03:11:11,250 --> 03:11:13,130
But you know how like...

2951
03:11:13,730 --> 03:11:15,890
Like places that sell used...

2952
03:11:15,890 --> 03:11:17,550
Like used books and stuff too.

2953
03:11:17,670 --> 03:11:19,670
But they also sometimes sell used...

2954
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:20,210
Games?

2955
03:11:22,550 --> 03:11:23,070
Actually...

2956
03:11:23,070 --> 03:11:25,550
I went to one of those places...

2957
03:11:25,550 --> 03:11:27,430
And that's actually where I found...

2958
03:11:27,430 --> 03:11:28,070
My...

2959
03:11:29,150 --> 03:11:30,110
MGS4 RISK.

2960
03:11:30,350 --> 03:11:32,690
So it's totally worth checking those places.

2961
03:11:33,130 --> 03:11:33,770
Hi, it's me!

2962
03:11:33,930 --> 03:11:34,870
Thanks for the 20 Gets!

2963
03:11:36,590 --> 03:11:38,570
Are you gonna try out War for Cybertron?

2964
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:40,690
And follow Cybertron after Deprestation?

2965
03:11:40,850 --> 03:11:41,270
Maybe.

2966
03:11:41,610 --> 03:11:42,250
I don't know yet.

2967
03:11:42,350 --> 03:11:43,430
I haven't really thought about it.

2968
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,140
Oh, why did I do that?

2969
03:11:51,320 --> 03:11:51,800
No!

2970
03:11:54,820 --> 03:11:56,820
We were right there!

2971
03:12:02,770 --> 03:12:05,610
We were right there!

2972
03:12:27,240 --> 03:12:28,940
Do I try one more time?

2973
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:30,520
Or do we give up?

2974
03:12:31,800 --> 03:12:32,820
Do I try one more time?

2975
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:33,520
Or do we give up?

2976
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:36,180
Needed more speed.

2977
03:12:36,460 --> 03:12:36,780
I know.

2978
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:39,560
Yeah, there's no boostering.

2979
03:12:40,100 --> 03:12:40,460
One more?

2980
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:41,120
Okay, one more.

2981
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:41,900
One more, one more, one more.

2982
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:45,100
One more, one more, one more.

2983
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:49,240
Maybe if I...

2984
03:12:50,040 --> 03:12:51,140
Let's try this.

2985
03:13:12,700 --> 03:13:13,140
Look!

2986
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:14,500
See, even though I got it...

2987
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:17,100
It's still listed as...

2988
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:19,260
That I have it.

2989
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:20,320
That's so strange.

2990
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:25,660
No, baby!

2991
03:13:36,190 --> 03:13:38,850
These look like the...

2992
03:13:38,850 --> 03:13:39,690
Hmm, okay.

2993
03:13:47,070 --> 03:13:49,170
Wow, there's tons of stuff over here.

2994
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,730
What the hell?

2995
03:13:50,810 --> 03:13:52,610
There's tons of lot...loot.

2996
03:13:52,690 --> 03:13:53,490
There's lots of loot.

2997
03:13:54,050 --> 03:13:55,070
Tons of lots.

2998
03:13:55,070 --> 03:13:55,830
Tons of lots.

2999
03:13:57,030 --> 03:13:57,130
Wow!

3000
03:13:59,830 --> 03:14:02,090
There's so much stuff over here!

3001
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:04,830
Let's go!

3002
03:14:05,090 --> 03:14:05,750
Tons of lot.

3003
03:14:07,670 --> 03:14:10,510
I thought it would be like a side quest, but no.

3004
03:14:12,390 --> 03:14:14,010
What is that?

3005
03:14:14,930 --> 03:14:15,610
Shiny.

3006
03:14:16,510 --> 03:14:17,410
What is that?

3007
03:14:18,870 --> 03:14:19,990
What is that?

3008
03:14:19,990 --> 03:14:20,150
What is that?

3009
03:14:24,370 --> 03:14:25,250
Looks yummy.

3010
03:14:30,210 --> 03:14:31,370
How would I get to that?

3011
03:14:36,770 --> 03:14:37,870
You gotta shoot it?

3012
03:14:40,550 --> 03:14:40,990
No?

3013
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:42,430
It looks like a grabable.

3014
03:14:43,030 --> 03:14:45,070
Looks like something you should...

3015
03:14:47,750 --> 03:14:48,850
She's a loot brand.

3016
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:49,690
I know, I'm sorry.

3017
03:14:50,470 --> 03:14:51,950
I'm sorry for my condition.

3018
03:14:53,430 --> 03:14:54,050
Oh, wait.

3019
03:14:59,970 --> 03:15:02,690
I wonder though if we can get to it from here.

3020
03:15:03,490 --> 03:15:04,670
No, we're too small.

3021
03:15:08,110 --> 03:15:08,630
Anyway.

3022
03:15:09,170 --> 03:15:09,850
It's fine.

3023
03:15:11,310 --> 03:15:12,870
Does anyone know what it's for though?

3024
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:23,880
So itty bitty.

3025
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:28,640
Oh, it's art.

3026
03:15:28,840 --> 03:15:29,020
Okay.

3027
03:15:33,350 --> 03:15:35,430
I didn't know what was gonna open up.

3028
03:15:40,970 --> 03:15:42,010
And then...

3029
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:42,350
Here.

3030
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:45,850
Come on, I still didn't even make it.

3031
03:15:58,490 --> 03:16:00,530
Let me in.

3032
03:16:01,730 --> 03:16:06,570
This is the boss for me.

3033
03:16:07,370 --> 03:16:09,050
Let me in, please.

3034
03:16:10,730 --> 03:16:12,650
Why do I keep...

3035
03:16:15,290 --> 03:16:17,310
I take damage no matter what.

3036
03:16:18,750 --> 03:16:20,130
I gotta keep going, right?

3037
03:16:20,430 --> 03:16:22,650
They're just like, don't fight it on your own.

3038
03:16:23,750 --> 03:16:24,290
Keep going.

3039
03:16:26,250 --> 03:16:26,730
Sorry.

3040
03:16:27,290 --> 03:16:28,710
I didn't mean to scream like that.

3041
03:16:29,990 --> 03:16:30,770
Can I use this?

3042
03:16:33,070 --> 03:16:34,670
How do I use it, actually?

3043
03:16:35,330 --> 03:16:36,210
Can I use this?

3044
03:16:36,530 --> 03:16:36,970
Thank you.

3045
03:16:38,350 --> 03:16:38,610
Let

3046
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:54,580
me grab my stuff first.

3047
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:56,960
Please, let me grab my loot.

3048
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:04,580
Oh my gosh.

3049
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:07,700
I just barely dodged that.

3050
03:17:10,200 --> 03:17:10,880
Nice.

3051
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:16,660
Oh, we got a thing on shockwave.

3052
03:17:16,760 --> 03:17:17,040
Cool.

3053
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:19,280
Game over.

3054
03:17:20,420 --> 03:17:22,940
Who else wants to mess with me?

3055
03:17:29,720 --> 03:17:31,100
It's pretty chill.

3056
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:32,200
We're searching?

3057
03:17:32,640 --> 03:17:34,220
That's not chill.

3058
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:43,760
That is convenient.

3059
03:17:49,360 --> 03:17:50,800
I love Touhou.

3060
03:18:00,220 --> 03:18:05,520
Oh my god.

3061
03:18:20,440 --> 03:18:22,880
They gave me such sweet loot though.

3062
03:18:38,090 --> 03:18:39,030
They're still going?

3063
03:18:39,670 --> 03:18:41,210
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

3064
03:18:42,210 --> 03:18:42,750
Oh my god.

3065
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:43,590
Oh no, no, no, no.

3066
03:18:44,510 --> 03:18:47,810
They're sending me their big blue balls.

3067
03:18:49,450 --> 03:18:50,550
What are those?

3068
03:18:54,210 --> 03:18:54,730
Nice.

3069
03:18:57,630 --> 03:18:58,790
I got an S rank.

3070
03:19:00,990 --> 03:19:02,550
Hey, I made it.

3071
03:19:02,690 --> 03:19:04,770
Why would you say that, Bumblebee?

3072
03:19:05,810 --> 03:19:07,090
You jinxed yourself.

3073
03:19:12,960 --> 03:19:15,020
Hey, I made it.

3074
03:19:17,420 --> 03:19:17,920
Scrapna.

3075
03:19:18,640 --> 03:19:19,140
Ancient.

3076
03:19:22,460 --> 03:19:23,640
Oh my god, oh my god.

3077
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:27,700
Shit.

3078
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,180
Oh my gosh, I can't dodge worth shit.

3079
03:19:34,380 --> 03:19:35,940
Oh, I'm gonna die here for real.

3080
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:46,260
I can't see anything.

3081
03:19:46,460 --> 03:19:49,600
I'm gonna

3082
03:19:53,650 --> 03:19:53,950
die.

3083
03:19:54,090 --> 03:19:54,990
I'm gonna die for sure.

3084
03:19:55,870 --> 03:19:59,210
Oh gosh, I'm trying to dodge, but I get stuck in a stunlock loop.

3085
03:20:08,090 --> 03:20:11,890
Well, I don't have anything to really kill you with.

3086
03:20:15,150 --> 03:20:16,410
Use my ult?

3087
03:20:20,950 --> 03:20:22,590
I forgot about it.

3088
03:20:22,930 --> 03:20:23,690
So true.

3089
03:20:23,810 --> 03:20:24,490
We don't wanna die.

3090
03:20:24,790 --> 03:20:25,990
No, don't die on us.

3091
03:20:26,610 --> 03:20:29,250
Supposed to be shrapnel, but Hasbro lost the trademark.

3092
03:20:30,150 --> 03:20:31,190
That's... no way.

3093
03:20:31,730 --> 03:20:32,810
Find the plasma core.

3094
03:20:33,630 --> 03:20:34,550
I'm almost dead.

3095
03:20:35,150 --> 03:20:39,730
Maybe I should have died just so I can get my health back.

3096
03:20:39,830 --> 03:20:40,750
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

3097
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:50,540
I'm searching.

3098
03:20:51,180 --> 03:20:52,340
Dying is for cowards.

3099
03:20:52,940 --> 03:20:55,360
I don't wanna use my healing items.

3100
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:58,900
Unless I'm in a fight, like a boss fight or something.

3101
03:21:01,740 --> 03:21:04,520
We don't know when things will get really tough, you guys.

3102
03:21:07,560 --> 03:21:09,340
Even though I'm on scout...

3103
03:21:13,950 --> 03:21:15,710
I'm looting a little bit.

3104
03:21:17,010 --> 03:21:19,070
My health is... my screen is flashing.

3105
03:21:21,010 --> 03:21:22,090
Ah...

3106
03:21:22,090 --> 03:21:25,530
What is this area?

3107
03:21:26,290 --> 03:21:27,370
Why are you so mysterious?

3108
03:21:33,630 --> 03:21:36,210
How is shrapnel a copyright?

3109
03:21:38,270 --> 03:21:41,890
When it's literally an actual word.

3110
03:21:43,430 --> 03:21:45,270
That shouldn't be allowed.

3111
03:21:52,140 --> 03:21:53,220
Bombshell.

3112
03:21:57,980 --> 03:21:58,920
I'm so dead.

3113
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:05,620
It's OK.

3114
03:22:05,940 --> 03:22:07,080
I think this is the checkpoint.

3115
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:35,600
Oh my gosh!

3116
03:22:35,640 --> 03:22:36,600
He was on top of me!

3117
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:00,760
Nice.

3118
03:23:03,860 --> 03:23:04,320
Back attack!

3119
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:06,000
Oh wait, where is the back shot?

3120
03:23:06,100 --> 03:23:06,760
Where is the back...

3121
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:08,240
Nevermind.

3122
03:23:15,630 --> 03:23:16,850
Where is my back attack?

3123
03:23:19,430 --> 03:23:20,990
What happened to it?

3124
03:23:22,310 --> 03:23:23,170
The what?

3125
03:23:23,750 --> 03:23:25,530
Oh, what did I say?

3126
03:23:27,750 --> 03:23:28,830
What did I say?

3127
03:23:28,950 --> 03:23:30,290
I said where is my back attack.

3128
03:23:30,630 --> 03:23:33,210
Oh oh, there is some craziness going on up in there.

3129
03:23:39,620 --> 03:23:40,980
You said back shot.

3130
03:23:40,980 --> 03:23:42,460
No, I said back attack!

3131
03:23:52,860 --> 03:23:55,580
Why does it keep saying that there is more?

3132
03:24:00,960 --> 03:24:01,680
Mysterious.

3133
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:07,180
I said it though!

3134
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:09,560
Maybe I didn't.

3135
03:24:09,720 --> 03:24:10,160
I don't know.

3136
03:24:10,860 --> 03:24:11,280
Whatever.

3137
03:24:12,880 --> 03:24:14,580
Let's get through!

3138
03:24:15,580 --> 03:24:19,680
These freaking doors are the pain of my existence.

3139
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:23,820
Can I just destroy this door?

3140
03:24:59,350 --> 03:25:01,050
Wow, that makes me feel special.

3141
03:25:06,590 --> 03:25:08,250
Oh shoot, that's not what I meant to do!

3142
03:25:11,850 --> 03:25:13,210
That's not what I meant to do.

3143
03:25:13,290 --> 03:25:14,090
I meant to dodge.

3144
03:25:20,240 --> 03:25:20,580
Oopsie.

3145
03:25:23,940 --> 03:25:24,540
Um...

3146
03:25:24,540 --> 03:25:27,960
Okay, we made it.

3147
03:25:28,980 --> 03:25:30,720
Oh, you can see when it saves.

3148
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:31,980
I just noticed at the bottom.

3149
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,260
That's quite nice.

3150
03:25:38,960 --> 03:25:39,560
Sneaky.

3151
03:25:40,980 --> 03:25:41,580
Sneaky.

3152
03:25:54,580 --> 03:25:56,000
Oh my gosh.

3153
03:25:59,620 --> 03:26:01,140
Okay, I'm here.

3154
03:26:01,640 --> 03:26:02,820
Where is the next part?

3155
03:26:02,980 --> 03:26:03,760
Oh, down here?

3156
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:06,560
Oh my gosh, how did I make it?

3157
03:26:07,160 --> 03:26:07,820
I'm too good.

3158
03:26:08,560 --> 03:26:09,440
I'm good!

3159
03:26:16,450 --> 03:26:17,450
I'm good!

3160
03:26:30,660 --> 03:26:33,560
If only I were as chill as this guy.

3161
03:26:34,360 --> 03:26:36,760
The part that says something different depending on who you play as.

3162
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:38,540
Goldfire or Goldbug copyright.

3163
03:26:38,880 --> 03:26:41,020
SB's upgraded form in season 3 of the cartoon.

3164
03:26:41,380 --> 03:26:42,720
Thank you guys for all the lore.

3165
03:26:44,540 --> 03:26:45,940
I do appreciate it.

3166
03:26:46,540 --> 03:26:49,840
Especially because, you know, I don't know a lot of stuff about...

3167
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:51,140
Oh my god.

3168
03:26:51,280 --> 03:26:52,080
Oh, please.

3169
03:26:52,540 --> 03:26:53,280
Oh, Bumblebee.

3170
03:26:54,080 --> 03:26:54,800
You're so good.

3171
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:02,580
Why are you doing that?

3172
03:27:09,030 --> 03:27:10,430
We made it!

3173
03:27:11,170 --> 03:27:12,570
Can I get a save point?

3174
03:27:13,890 --> 03:27:15,370
Can I get a checkpoint?

3175
03:27:16,290 --> 03:27:18,210
Can I get a checkpoint in the chat?

3176
03:27:18,570 --> 03:27:22,130
Can I get a checkpoint in the chat?

3177
03:27:23,330 --> 03:27:24,570
Why are they so...

3178
03:27:36,030 --> 03:27:36,670
Checkpoint!

3179
03:27:36,670 --> 03:27:37,870
Checkpoint!

3180
03:27:39,830 --> 03:27:42,510
I am being educated in the lore myself.

3181
03:27:43,150 --> 03:27:46,370
My fig is...

3182
03:27:50,710 --> 03:27:51,450
Wow.

3183
03:27:52,130 --> 03:27:53,370
That sounds pretty precise.

3184
03:28:01,110 --> 03:28:02,530
Proud Star 3.

3185
03:28:06,360 --> 03:28:07,920
I like how they are like...

3186
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:09,640
You want to like update...

3187
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:10,700
You want to like...

3188
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:16,040
You want to like fix yourself up a little bit first?

3189
03:28:17,640 --> 03:28:19,280
Before you go in there, huh?

3190
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:22,820
You want to do that, buddy?

3191
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:26,160
We didn't get much good stuff.

3192
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:33,460
Totally not a boss arena.

3193
03:28:34,400 --> 03:28:36,700
I know we can play as Wheeljack.

3194
03:28:37,920 --> 03:28:39,400
I like Bumblebee.

3195
03:28:42,340 --> 03:28:43,220
What should

3196
03:28:47,850 --> 03:28:50,490
we do?

3197
03:28:54,480 --> 03:28:55,980
What's some new moves we can get?

3198
03:28:56,300 --> 03:28:56,660
Burnout?

3199
03:28:58,080 --> 03:29:00,060
Vehicle mode and not moving.

3200
03:29:00,220 --> 03:29:02,420
Hold O to start a burnout.

3201
03:29:03,440 --> 03:29:03,840
Interesting.

3202
03:29:04,120 --> 03:29:04,760
Rush combo.

3203
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:06,360
Parry.

3204
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:08,800
Parry the platypus.

3205
03:29:08,800 --> 03:29:12,000
Find achieving focus.

3206
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:17,120
Hold square or triangle or L2 to perform a vicious counterattack.

3207
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:19,840
Spin attack.

3208
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:23,040
Rotate L 360 degrees and triangle.

3209
03:29:25,020 --> 03:29:27,200
These are some real fighting game moves.

3210
03:29:29,720 --> 03:29:32,180
Powerful shove that puts enemies off balance.

3211
03:29:32,300 --> 03:29:34,780
Quickly tilt the movement button back then forward.

3212
03:29:37,220 --> 03:29:38,960
Probably just like that.

3213
03:29:42,480 --> 03:29:45,140
Or we could keep doing gacha.

3214
03:29:49,300 --> 03:29:51,860
When are we going to unlock the stuff that's like...

3215
03:29:51,860 --> 03:29:52,420
Look at this.

3216
03:29:52,440 --> 03:29:57,180
This is 180,000 points but it's still rank C.

3217
03:29:57,320 --> 03:30:01,280
Is that because of the level or like just how good it is?

3218
03:30:04,360 --> 03:30:05,820
Let's go gambling.

3219
03:30:10,360 --> 03:30:11,840
Bayonetta with robots.

3220
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:16,460
I did not play Bayonetta so I apologize.

3221
03:30:21,990 --> 03:30:23,470
Just as it lands.

3222
03:30:23,630 --> 03:30:25,730
I'm always pushing the movement button though.

3223
03:30:26,770 --> 03:30:28,490
I could get it still.

3224
03:30:30,670 --> 03:30:31,670
What is focus?

3225
03:30:32,490 --> 03:30:37,790
Is that when I dodge correctly and then...

3226
03:30:37,790 --> 03:30:40,510
That's when I dodge and I go into slow-mo, right?

3227
03:30:47,710 --> 03:30:48,310
Yeah?

3228
03:30:48,310 --> 03:30:49,590
Still safe is good.

3229
03:30:50,610 --> 03:30:54,750
Dodge an enemy's attacks at just the right moment to induce focus.

3230
03:30:55,270 --> 03:30:57,250
Press R1 just as you are hit.

3231
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:02,930
So if I get hit and I press R1 really...

3232
03:31:03,830 --> 03:31:05,910
That one is actually...

3233
03:31:05,910 --> 03:31:08,510
Because so often I'm just like... I pressed dodge.

3234
03:31:10,470 --> 03:31:11,770
Maybe that one would be good.

3235
03:31:12,910 --> 03:31:14,010
Extra dodge frames.

3236
03:31:14,250 --> 03:31:14,510
Yeah.

3237
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:16,050
I'm going to get that one.

3238
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:18,690
Nice.

3239
03:31:19,430 --> 03:31:21,630
And then we could sell some stuff.

3240
03:31:21,790 --> 03:31:22,930
Maybe we could make...

3241
03:31:24,310 --> 03:31:25,430
What the heck?

3242
03:31:26,170 --> 03:31:29,450
I thought that... It didn't look like a fist at a glance.

3243
03:31:29,490 --> 03:31:30,410
It looked like...

3244
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:34,410
Something else.

3245
03:31:34,570 --> 03:31:35,410
I don't want to sell that.

3246
03:31:35,490 --> 03:31:36,930
Wait, I want to equip the...

3247
03:31:37,950 --> 03:31:38,350
Weapons?

3248
03:31:39,090 --> 03:31:41,370
I think we could equip...

3249
03:31:41,370 --> 03:31:41,930
Let's see.

3250
03:31:41,990 --> 03:31:42,630
Wait, what's better?

3251
03:31:42,770 --> 03:31:44,630
The drills or... Let's see.

3252
03:31:45,690 --> 03:31:45,990
No.

3253
03:31:47,070 --> 03:31:48,650
Maybe it's better than the swords though.

3254
03:31:49,330 --> 03:31:49,730
No.

3255
03:31:52,410 --> 03:31:53,070
Like what?

3256
03:31:53,170 --> 03:31:54,490
It looked like...

3257
03:31:58,910 --> 03:32:00,110
Like a hole.

3258
03:32:00,570 --> 03:32:01,710
Like a booty hole.

3259
03:32:01,870 --> 03:32:02,710
OK, I'll say it.

3260
03:32:03,490 --> 03:32:05,090
It looked like a booty hole.

3261
03:32:05,330 --> 03:32:05,590
OK.

3262
03:32:06,190 --> 03:32:06,970
Are you happy now?

3263
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:23,240
One of my friends the other day was just like...

3264
03:32:23,240 --> 03:32:27,480
You should do like a live stream of your cats, you know?

3265
03:32:28,680 --> 03:32:29,160
Like...

3266
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:33,460
You should do a live stream where your cats are just on the camera and they're just like...

3267
03:32:33,460 --> 03:32:35,680
Chilling and, you know, relaxing.

3268
03:32:36,140 --> 03:32:39,160
Especially Paws since people haven't seen her so much.

3269
03:32:39,580 --> 03:32:41,020
And I was like...

3270
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:42,540
I was like...

3271
03:32:42,540 --> 03:32:44,400
Yeah, but she doesn't do anything.

3272
03:32:44,620 --> 03:32:48,760
Like, actually, she is constantly cleaning herself and...

3273
03:32:48,760 --> 03:32:51,160
I was like, nobody wants to watch her lick her booty hole.

3274
03:32:51,460 --> 03:32:53,300
Like, that's all she does all day.

3275
03:32:53,800 --> 03:32:55,540
She's just...

3276
03:32:56,480 --> 03:32:57,620
I just don't...

3277
03:32:58,060 --> 03:33:00,840
I don't think everybody wants to watch that.

3278
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:01,980
Says you.

3279
03:33:05,320 --> 03:33:06,800
She's just like me.

3280
03:33:07,260 --> 03:33:07,740
Tiara?

3281
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:09,680
Girl?

3282
03:33:09,680 --> 03:33:13,380
As a cat owner, I think it's cute.

3283
03:33:13,740 --> 03:33:15,440
She's also just all over the place.

3284
03:33:15,540 --> 03:33:16,720
I don't think I would be able to...

3285
03:33:19,140 --> 03:33:20,020
Keep her...

3286
03:33:20,820 --> 03:33:21,260
Actually...

3287
03:33:21,260 --> 03:33:22,800
I don't know, maybe if she laid in her bed.

3288
03:33:23,020 --> 03:33:24,680
She has a bed in my room, so...

3289
03:33:27,020 --> 03:33:28,600
She's a very clean cat.

3290
03:33:33,340 --> 03:33:37,920
It would be great if I could get her and Butaro licking each other.

3291
03:33:38,220 --> 03:33:38,640
And then...

3292
03:33:39,200 --> 03:33:40,400
Also fighting each other.

3293
03:33:40,400 --> 03:33:43,160
Because they do that thing where they lick, lick, lick.

3294
03:33:43,900 --> 03:33:44,740
Fight, fight, fight.

3295
03:33:45,460 --> 03:33:46,080
Oh, sorry.

3296
03:33:48,860 --> 03:33:50,080
Yeah, that's a great question.

3297
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:51,160
I'm just yapping, sorry.

3298
03:33:51,620 --> 03:33:53,640
Oh, I want to... I want to sit and...

3299
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:54,660
I want to develop some tech.

3300
03:33:55,700 --> 03:33:57,060
I love the gacha.

3301
03:33:59,440 --> 03:34:02,380
But I wish I could have more equipment spots.

3302
03:34:03,380 --> 03:34:05,340
Is that something that I can...

3303
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:07,220
Like, upgrade somehow?

3304
03:34:12,020 --> 03:34:15,400
Like, Optimus Prime gets three...

3305
03:34:16,560 --> 03:34:18,100
Ready, ready, ready.

3306
03:34:19,300 --> 03:34:20,480
Upgrade stats.

3307
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:25,560
But that I can only do in battle, right?

3308
03:34:26,020 --> 03:34:26,480
I imagine.

3309
03:34:32,240 --> 03:34:33,460
Oh, look at this!

3310
03:34:33,500 --> 03:34:34,800
This one is so close.

3311
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:36,680
Add EXP.

3312
03:34:42,830 --> 03:34:44,670
Wait, no, it's really far away.

3313
03:34:46,670 --> 03:34:47,530
Split screen.

3314
03:34:47,630 --> 03:34:49,550
Cats on top, you play MGS on the bottom.

3315
03:34:50,590 --> 03:34:51,470
That'd be great.

3316
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:54,970
Just Prime.

3317
03:34:58,630 --> 03:35:00,610
We need to rank up the last one.

3318
03:35:01,070 --> 03:35:01,610
This one?

3319
03:35:02,970 --> 03:35:04,910
But we need to get it, like...

3320
03:35:04,910 --> 03:35:06,330
All the way... So, look at this.

3321
03:35:06,410 --> 03:35:06,690
Watch.

3322
03:35:09,190 --> 03:35:10,070
It only...

3323
03:35:10,070 --> 03:35:11,810
Oh wait, it did go up one rank.

3324
03:35:14,350 --> 03:35:14,870
Oh...

3325
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:20,300
Boo.

3326
03:35:22,120 --> 03:35:22,640
Boo.

3327
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:26,160
Chatamus Prime.

3328
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:27,700
I like Bumblebee.

3329
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:36,760
Watching your stream while browsing for a yummy merch to buy.

3330
03:35:38,100 --> 03:35:40,080
What kind of merch are you looking for?

3331
03:35:42,280 --> 03:35:46,100
The stats are also a reference to the stats printed on the box of each of the original toys.

3332
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:46,880
Stop!

3333
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,220
This game is so in-depth, so detailed.

3334
03:35:50,260 --> 03:35:51,580
Let's see how we do on the boss.

3335
03:35:53,980 --> 03:35:55,660
Did I switch out the weapons or anything?

3336
03:35:56,140 --> 03:35:56,920
I don't think so.

3337
03:35:59,060 --> 03:35:59,460
Let's...

3338
03:35:59,460 --> 03:36:02,780
I'm gonna synthesize my gloves.

3339
03:36:04,500 --> 03:36:06,780
I'm gonna synthesize... Where are the...

3340
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:08,260
Where are they?

3341
03:36:09,340 --> 03:36:10,400
Oh, the drills, yeah.

3342
03:36:15,980 --> 03:36:16,380
Synthesize...

3343
03:36:16,380 --> 03:36:17,800
I'll just use, like...

3344
03:36:17,800 --> 03:36:19,060
Oh, but it costs a lot of money.

3345
03:36:19,840 --> 03:36:21,860
Oh, but that goes up pretty high.

3346
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:25,060
Synthesizing.

3347
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:29,760
I'm gonna keep going.

3348
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:32,260
I'm gonna level it up to level 6 at least.

3349
03:36:42,300 --> 03:36:43,160
I like the drills.

3350
03:36:54,220 --> 03:36:55,220
Oh, interesting.

3351
03:36:55,500 --> 03:36:55,660
What?

3352
03:36:58,520 --> 03:37:00,100
Oh, skills to be transferred?

3353
03:37:01,260 --> 03:37:01,860
What?

3354
03:37:01,860 --> 03:37:02,200
What?

3355
03:37:02,920 --> 03:37:04,180
Health recovery up.

3356
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:08,260
Increases the recovery rate by the ultimate gauge by 8%.

3357
03:37:08,940 --> 03:37:11,140
Increases the amount of health recovered by 6%.

3358
03:37:11,460 --> 03:37:14,860
Increases weapon energy recovery item drop rate by 15%.

3359
03:37:17,580 --> 03:37:18,840
Oh, neat!

3360
03:37:28,220 --> 03:37:29,840
All in shuts off healing.

3361
03:37:30,620 --> 03:37:30,940
It did?

3362
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:32,940
Boy, it did.

3363
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:34,500
What did it do?

3364
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:34,900
Hold on.

3365
03:37:44,500 --> 03:37:47,440
Oh, increases attack at the cost of losing ability to recover.

3366
03:37:48,660 --> 03:37:51,740
No wonder I've been taking so much...

3367
03:37:51,740 --> 03:37:53,760
Like, my health has been so much lower.

3368
03:37:54,600 --> 03:37:56,240
I thought the game was just getting harder.

3369
03:37:59,620 --> 03:38:01,760
You don't need to heal if you don't get hit.

3370
03:38:02,160 --> 03:38:04,840
We did just buy that new skill, right?

3371
03:38:06,700 --> 03:38:08,400
Okay, I'm gonna develop one more time.

3372
03:38:08,700 --> 03:38:09,520
We might get lucky.

3373
03:38:10,520 --> 03:38:11,460
We might get lucky!

3374
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:21,560
What?

3375
03:38:22,260 --> 03:38:22,460
What?

3376
03:38:22,460 --> 03:38:23,020
All in again?

3377
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:29,500
Damage down.

3378
03:38:29,580 --> 03:38:30,400
What was the other one we got?

3379
03:38:31,200 --> 03:38:32,640
Ultimate move attack up.

3380
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:36,600
I like the damage down better.

3381
03:38:36,940 --> 03:38:38,560
Especially if we are not able to heal.

3382
03:38:39,960 --> 03:38:40,740
It's a sign.

3383
03:38:41,700 --> 03:38:42,100
You know what?

3384
03:38:42,100 --> 03:38:42,800
Let's just try it.

3385
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:44,800
If we wanna come back, we can.

3386
03:38:44,800 --> 03:38:46,420
Do they stack?

3387
03:38:47,160 --> 03:38:47,720
I don't know.

3388
03:38:48,580 --> 03:38:49,600
Here we go!

3389
03:38:57,640 --> 03:39:00,620
I like this stage a whole lot.

3390
03:39:00,960 --> 03:39:04,920
The fact that the ground is kind of bouncy.

3391
03:39:07,640 --> 03:39:08,340
Eww...

3392
03:39:12,160 --> 03:39:13,560
Kick

3393
03:39:16,850 --> 03:39:18,250
back!

3394
03:39:29,140 --> 03:39:31,080
Shoot, he's fast.

3395
03:39:35,220 --> 03:39:37,320
Oh my gosh!

3396
03:39:56,620 --> 03:39:57,420
Phase 2!

3397
03:39:59,220 --> 03:40:00,700
Oh, that's not good.

3398
03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:03,320
Really?

3399
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:10,180
Oh my god, no way.

3400
03:40:10,700 --> 03:40:11,760
Oh my gosh, they're crazy.

3401
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:18,280
Scary.

3402
03:40:23,460 --> 03:40:24,900
Scary, scary, scary.

3403
03:40:31,890 --> 03:40:32,970
Oh my god, oh my god.

3404
03:40:33,950 --> 03:40:35,570
All three of them at once.

3405
03:40:35,870 --> 03:40:37,090
Oh my gosh!

3406
03:40:38,950 --> 03:40:40,170
Screw it, just attack!

3407
03:40:48,140 --> 03:40:50,120
Oh my god, I don't know who to attack.

3408
03:41:00,160 --> 03:41:00,860
Let's go.

3409
03:41:02,980 --> 03:41:04,660
Oh shoot, I meant to...

3410
03:41:04,660 --> 03:41:06,020
I meant to dodge.

3411
03:41:16,180 --> 03:41:16,920
Ouchie, ouchie.

3412
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:17,800
Run!

3413
03:41:21,050 --> 03:41:21,430
No!

3414
03:41:24,650 --> 03:41:26,190
Why am I not using the drills?

3415
03:41:26,970 --> 03:41:27,370
Oh my god.

3416
03:41:27,450 --> 03:41:28,030
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3417
03:41:28,190 --> 03:41:28,630
Can I leave?

3418
03:41:42,900 --> 03:41:43,340
Hey!

3419
03:41:43,700 --> 03:41:44,100
You!

3420
03:41:49,250 --> 03:41:49,690
Nice!

3421
03:41:50,650 --> 03:41:51,090
Alright!

3422
03:41:51,090 --> 03:41:51,230
Alright.

3423
03:42:05,260 --> 03:42:06,480
He's so zippy.

3424
03:42:06,640 --> 03:42:07,780
I know, I love it!

3425
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:10,720
Ok!

3426
03:42:12,740 --> 03:42:14,040
Pull it out!

3427
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:16,980
Ok, stop acting so nonchalant.

3428
03:42:27,420 --> 03:42:31,220
Please, don't give up already.

3429
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:34,580
Almost through!

3430
03:42:37,220 --> 03:42:39,880
Oh shoot, oh shoot, oh shoot.

3431
03:42:40,320 --> 03:42:41,540
Where did these guys come from?

3432
03:42:44,880 --> 03:42:46,140
Just ignore them.

3433
03:42:52,420 --> 03:42:53,180
Nice.

3434
03:42:56,300 --> 03:42:56,740
Nice.

3435
03:42:57,240 --> 03:42:57,960
Oh shoot.

3436
03:43:01,020 --> 03:43:02,480
Oh my god, wait, what do you mean?

3437
03:43:05,200 --> 03:43:06,660
Oh gosh, I have a time limit!

3438
03:43:06,780 --> 03:43:07,900
I just noticed the time limit.

3439
03:43:09,880 --> 03:43:11,920
Ok, alright, alright, alright.

3440
03:43:16,970 --> 03:43:18,070
Oh, we did it.

3441
03:43:18,770 --> 03:43:19,450
Easy peasy.

3442
03:43:19,730 --> 03:43:20,970
It will explode.

3443
03:43:22,450 --> 03:43:23,710
This guy is the same guy I actually play.

3444
03:43:23,750 --> 03:43:24,850
One of my favorite childhood games.

3445
03:43:25,230 --> 03:43:28,050
You get the chance to try Warper's Cybercharm and follow Cybercharm's music.

3446
03:43:33,790 --> 03:43:35,450
I will try to play them.

3447
03:43:35,610 --> 03:43:38,290
Sorry, my contacts are killing me today.

3448
03:43:42,890 --> 03:43:43,250
Ok!

3449
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:50,610
Sorry, hold on, my eye drops.

3450
03:43:53,130 --> 03:43:53,590
Oh...

3451
03:43:56,850 --> 03:43:59,530
I don't know why my eyes are stinging so much today.

3452
03:44:00,030 --> 03:44:00,810
Oh, I got a blip!

3453
03:44:10,090 --> 03:44:12,250
I don't know why my eyes are stinging.

3454
03:44:12,390 --> 03:44:13,770
I might have to call it done.

3455
03:44:14,590 --> 03:44:16,030
I wanted to get at least halfway.

3456
03:44:16,890 --> 03:44:18,330
Well, halfway would have been...

3457
03:44:19,090 --> 03:44:20,330
Chapter 4, but...

3458
03:44:31,440 --> 03:44:32,720
2 out of 7.

3459
03:44:34,820 --> 03:44:35,320
Maybe...

3460
03:44:37,400 --> 03:44:37,900
Maybe...

3461
03:44:37,900 --> 03:44:40,720
Later this week I can just kind of...

3462
03:44:41,240 --> 03:44:47,680
If I'm taking... I'm usually pretty slow with games because I like to run around and I like to yap and I like to explore and stuff.

3463
03:44:49,280 --> 03:44:53,120
So maybe later this week we can...

3464
03:44:53,120 --> 03:44:56,760
I could just endurance it or something and we can finish it up.

3465
03:44:57,760 --> 03:44:59,400
Probably wouldn't be so much of an endurance.

3466
03:44:59,620 --> 03:45:00,620
Probably like... I don't know.

3467
03:45:00,620 --> 03:45:04,600
I consider like 6 hours an endurance kind of way, you know?

3468
03:45:05,860 --> 03:45:07,500
But it's so fun!

3469
03:45:07,640 --> 03:45:08,320
Oh my gosh.

3470
03:45:12,760 --> 03:45:14,160
Sorry princess, thank you!

3471
03:45:14,320 --> 03:45:17,620
Sorry guys, I would play more, but I actually...

3472
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:21,580
My contacts today are just going crazy.

3473
03:45:21,760 --> 03:45:23,100
Transformers movie watch along?

3474
03:45:24,320 --> 03:45:26,980
I do want to watch it before we continue playing.

3475
03:45:27,960 --> 03:45:29,420
I will try and...

3476
03:45:29,420 --> 03:45:30,980
My schedule is...

3477
03:45:32,200 --> 03:45:34,900
Maybe this is a Transformers week.

3478
03:45:36,620 --> 03:45:39,540
It is a Transformers week maybe.

3479
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:43,240
But I also have to finish...

3480
03:45:43,240 --> 03:45:45,500
I have to finish Lifeline 2.

3481
03:45:48,640 --> 03:45:49,760
Hot dog!

3482
03:45:49,780 --> 03:45:50,980
Hot dog indeed!

3483
03:45:52,840 --> 03:45:56,260
Highly recommend the basics by Chris McFeely on YouTube.

3484
03:45:56,380 --> 03:45:58,580
10 to 15 minute videos that cover everything.

3485
03:45:59,220 --> 03:46:00,500
It's a lord of biology!

3486
03:46:01,120 --> 03:46:02,240
Thank you, K-1!

3487
03:46:05,800 --> 03:46:07,560
I'm in for Transformers week.

3488
03:46:10,820 --> 03:46:14,860
I'm trying to figure out if I have enough time to like have a watch along and have...

3489
03:46:14,860 --> 03:46:17,240
If I don't do a watch along this week, we can definitely do it.

3490
03:46:18,640 --> 03:46:19,040
Well...

3491
03:46:19,900 --> 03:46:21,420
Maybe before I go to Japan.

3492
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:25,280
I

3493
03:46:30,590 --> 03:46:32,370
do want to kind of...

3494
03:46:32,370 --> 03:46:35,090
Since I'm in mid-play, I would like to watch the movie.

3495
03:46:35,410 --> 03:46:39,230
So I can understand more about the characters and the lore, you know what I mean?

3496
03:46:39,730 --> 03:46:40,770
I think that would be fun.

3497
03:46:41,610 --> 03:46:42,470
Great job, Miki-chan!

3498
03:46:42,750 --> 03:46:44,950
I've been trapped at home in a snowstorm!

3499
03:46:45,130 --> 03:46:46,290
It was really fun to watch you play!

3500
03:46:47,530 --> 03:46:48,330
Stay warm!

3501
03:46:48,690 --> 03:46:49,650
Stay warm, stay warm.

3502
03:46:53,070 --> 03:46:55,630
Will I be getting the figures in the future?

3503
03:46:56,570 --> 03:46:57,390
It depends.

3504
03:46:58,630 --> 03:47:01,870
Do I have space for another collection?

3505
03:47:02,450 --> 03:47:02,690
No.

3506
03:47:03,770 --> 03:47:05,130
Will that stop me?

3507
03:47:06,170 --> 03:47:07,130
Who knows.

3508
03:47:08,530 --> 03:47:10,350
Will I maybe get the Kotobukiya...

3509
03:47:10,350 --> 03:47:13,290
Have you guys seen those Kotobukiya Bishoujo figures?

3510
03:47:14,790 --> 03:47:16,030
Casio, welcome to membership!

3511
03:47:16,250 --> 03:47:17,070
Thank you!

3512
03:47:19,170 --> 03:47:22,150
They have like Optimus and Megatron versions.

3513
03:47:22,150 --> 03:47:23,990
I don't know if they made anyone else though.

3514
03:47:25,230 --> 03:47:27,110
But I could at least get those.

3515
03:47:32,250 --> 03:47:33,210
Kotobukiya Bishoujo...

3516
03:47:33,210 --> 03:47:33,950
Oh, Transformers!

3517
03:47:34,210 --> 03:47:36,070
Oh my gosh, my phone is listening to me.

3518
03:47:36,630 --> 03:47:38,730
Oh wait, they made a Bumblebee it looks like.

3519
03:47:39,890 --> 03:47:40,650
Who is this?

3520
03:47:43,070 --> 03:47:44,010
Who is this?

3521
03:47:45,390 --> 03:47:46,630
It's not saying to me.

3522
03:47:48,250 --> 03:47:49,330
Oh, Thundercracker!

3523
03:47:49,750 --> 03:47:51,210
They made a Thundercracker one too.

3524
03:47:51,210 --> 03:47:53,010
Last year, actually.

3525
03:47:54,710 --> 03:47:56,830
The Optimus one is so cute.

3526
03:47:57,210 --> 03:47:59,150
Oh my goodness, I love her little hair buns.

3527
03:47:59,290 --> 03:48:00,110
If you've ever seen them.

3528
03:48:04,210 --> 03:48:06,290
They made Starscream and the Seekers.

3529
03:48:08,490 --> 03:48:10,510
They made way more than I thought they did.

3530
03:48:12,030 --> 03:48:15,450
Thumbnail art was actually based loosely off the Bumblebee outfit as well.

3531
03:48:17,610 --> 03:48:18,850
I love Bumblebee.

3532
03:48:20,390 --> 03:48:22,850
But yeah, we'll do more Transformers.

3533
03:48:23,910 --> 03:48:24,750
We will, we will.

3534
03:48:24,870 --> 03:48:26,290
Sorry about my eyes, guys.

3535
03:48:26,450 --> 03:48:27,030
I'm so sorry.

3536
03:48:30,050 --> 03:48:32,130
But yeah, I hope you had fun.

3537
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:34,090
This game is so...

3538
03:48:34,090 --> 03:48:35,630
So much fun to play.

3539
03:48:35,810 --> 03:48:38,430
I feel so bad that it's delisted.

3540
03:48:38,790 --> 03:48:41,670
So that more people can't play it.

3541
03:48:42,270 --> 03:48:43,730
Impact, welcome to membership!

3542
03:48:43,910 --> 03:48:44,350
Thank you!

3543
03:48:44,950 --> 03:48:46,070
I feel like model kits.

3544
03:48:46,070 --> 03:48:49,930
The Bloki's TF1 Optimus and Megatron are really good.

3545
03:48:50,070 --> 03:48:50,930
$50 each?

3546
03:48:51,050 --> 03:48:51,930
Wow, that's so cheap.

3547
03:48:52,850 --> 03:48:54,030
You don't need any tools.

3548
03:48:56,210 --> 03:49:00,070
I'm not a super model kit person because I'm too much of a perfectionist.

3549
03:49:01,210 --> 03:49:03,850
I don't have time to learn...

3550
03:49:03,850 --> 03:49:05,150
I want to paint them, right?

3551
03:49:05,190 --> 03:49:10,270
But I don't have time to learn how to paint so well.

3552
03:49:11,310 --> 03:49:12,830
To my standards.

3553
03:49:13,730 --> 03:49:16,170
So, I'm like...

3554
03:49:16,170 --> 03:49:19,510
It's the same with garage kits and figures and stuff too.

3555
03:49:22,970 --> 03:49:24,490
Small blaster.

3556
03:49:27,730 --> 03:49:28,610
Grimlock!

3557
03:49:28,610 --> 03:49:29,330
Grimlock.

3558
03:49:39,830 --> 03:49:44,660
All he does is grunt.

3559
03:49:54,220 --> 03:49:57,140
I love me a character that grunts.

3560
03:50:03,140 --> 03:50:03,900
Let's see.

3561
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:07,060
Only one slot!

3562
03:50:07,480 --> 03:50:08,000
Grimlock!

3563
03:50:09,900 --> 03:50:11,380
They're nerfing you!

3564
03:50:12,280 --> 03:50:14,200
Mint with her eyes bleeding out.

3565
03:50:14,780 --> 03:50:16,520
They're not bleeding out.

3566
03:50:16,620 --> 03:50:20,300
I don't know why they're so dry today.

3567
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:23,360
Maybe because I woke up early.

3568
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:24,780
Maybe just because I slept bad.

3569
03:50:24,900 --> 03:50:25,820
I don't know.

3570
03:50:28,580 --> 03:50:30,360
Being a ghost is hard.

3571
03:50:32,940 --> 03:50:36,680
I gotta keep my ectoplasm properly hydrated.

3572
03:50:38,160 --> 03:50:39,180
Could be the weather.

3573
03:50:39,400 --> 03:50:39,980
It could be.

3574
03:50:40,480 --> 03:50:43,200
I did go outside and I don't like doing that.

3575
03:50:44,340 --> 03:50:46,400
I don't like doing that!

3576
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:49,200
But anyways, I hope you guys had fun!

3577
03:50:49,540 --> 03:50:51,000
And I will see you guys when I see you next.

3578
03:50:51,600 --> 03:50:56,440
Have a good morning, day, evening, night, whatever time it is for you!

3579
03:50:56,780 --> 03:50:59,100
And I'll see you when I see you!

3580
03:50:59,100 --> 03:50:59,500
See you!

3581
03:51:02,680 --> 03:51:03,200
Otsumito!

3582
03:51:04,580 --> 03:51:05,560
Thanks for the stream!

3583
03:51:05,740 --> 03:51:06,020
Thank you!

3584
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:07,400
Thank you for today too!

3585
03:51:09,360 --> 03:51:10,240
Bye bye!

3586
03:51:14,340 --> 03:51:14,860
Otsumito!

3587
03:51:49,160 --> 03:51:50,440
Oh my god, you guys.

3588
03:51:50,540 --> 03:51:55,160
Sorry to interrupt, but I just went to the art gallery and look at this visual!

3589
03:51:56,200 --> 03:51:56,720
Wow!

3590
03:51:57,880 --> 03:51:59,380
Oh my gosh, it's so awesome!

3591
03:51:59,380 --> 03:52:00,120
Wow!

3592
03:52:04,580 --> 03:52:05,020
Wow!

3593
03:52:05,020 --> 03:52:05,460
Sorry.

3594
03:52:06,860 --> 03:52:07,300
Wow!

3595
03:52:09,980 --> 03:52:10,420
Wow!

3596
03:52:12,700 --> 03:52:14,400
Wait, I want to use this as my thumbnail.

3597
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:17,100
Excuse me?

3598
03:52:18,180 --> 03:52:19,160
Excuse you guys too?

3599
03:52:20,940 --> 03:52:21,680
Thumbnail art?

3600
03:52:22,860 --> 03:52:23,660
Or this one?

3601
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:24,780
No, we can't use this one.

3602
03:52:24,940 --> 03:52:25,720
Look at him!

3603
03:52:29,460 --> 03:52:32,640
Why does it look like his gun has a suppressor on it?

3604
03:52:35,720 --> 03:52:36,280
Wow!

3605
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:38,060
Generations art.

3606
03:52:41,300 --> 03:52:42,580
He's just a truck.

3607
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:47,520
Oh my god, the guy is dead on the ground.

3608
03:52:48,220 --> 03:52:48,780
Crazy.

3609
03:52:49,380 --> 03:52:49,940
Okay, bye!
