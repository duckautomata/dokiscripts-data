00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,610
Hello,

2
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,890
hello, hello, hello, I come to you from the corner.

3
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,140
Somebody put baby in the corner.

4
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,430
Chill, Minky.

5
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,470
Today, we'll be a bit more chill.

6
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,230
Sorry in advance.

7
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,870
Nobody put baby in the corner.

8
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,010
I'm baby in the corner.

9
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,110
Minto of the corner.

10
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,170
What is your wisdom?

11
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,980
Block game is fun.

12
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,560
That is my...

13
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,820
That is my wisdom.

14
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,860
Very wise.

15
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,100
It doesn't matter what kind of block game.

16
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,660
Block game is fun.

17
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,080
Um, I did play, or rather, so I played with Matara.

18
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,440
And then I have, I'm in my own world that I was playing
myself too, just kind of to get more used to the game.

19
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:53,160
But if you guys want me to make a new world, That's okay
too.

20
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,430
Sorry not feeling well myself.

21
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,130
Can you use the same one?

22
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,110
I can show you guys my house.

23
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,190
It's only infested a little bit.

24
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,690
Okay, I'll show you my house.

25
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,170
I'll show you my house.

26
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,330
Do you want a house, Tor?

27
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,390
I can take you to the first, second, third floor.

28
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,030
Why am I on fire?

29
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,370
Why am I on fire?

30
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,610
Welcome to my house.

31
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,310
I adopted this home.

32
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,750
I made it mine.

33
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:00,710
planted some lavenders around and

34
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:29,480
sometimes some scallions up here but it's totally not a big
deal nobody's here let's go to sleep oh wait do you want the

35
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,360
house door I can take you to the first

36
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Second!

37
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,130
Third floor!

38
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,630
It's got a sunroof and everything.

39
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,950
Isn't it so great?

40
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,430
Look at that view.

41
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,770
Open view and everything.

42
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,470
I can see the pigs from here.

43
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,050
Wait, what is that?

44
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,910
Why is it rolling?

45
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,470
Wait, I don't think that's a pig.

46
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,850
What is that?

47
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,080
It's gone.

48
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,980
So mysterious.

49
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,060
They're gone.

50
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,800
I haven't explored so much of this.

51
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,500
See?

52
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,860
Well, I did die there.

53
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,020
And spawn is right there.

54
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,280
So if I die, die.

55
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm not so far.

56
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,660
I did die there too.

57
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,180
I haven't.

58
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,040
I have only been here.

59
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,020
And, uh, like a little past here.

60
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,660
I have not been here.

61
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,980
Which this looks like the scary area.

62
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,280
It's the scarier, if you will.

63
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,200
We could go wherever we want.

64
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,020
The world is our oyster.

65
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm kind of curious what this is, though.

66
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
It's just like a random structure.

67
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,700
There's also the blueberry woods.

68
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:51,960
Hmm.

69
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,560
Search for dinosaurs today?

70
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,880
Yes.

71
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
The scarier.

72
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,690
Let's go...

73
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,610
Wait, that's spawn.

74
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,550
I don't know.

75
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,790
Still, I'm getting used to... Oh yeah.

76
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,270
There was one...

77
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,790
Last time I played, there was like a thing that I was
like...

78
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:17,830
Okay.

79
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,030
You know, in Minecraft, if you press Q, you throw an item.

80
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,470
In this game, you'll have to press G.

81
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,670
I don't know why I didn't just like look it up.

82
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:50,230
while I was playing but you know yeah I do for throw I also
want to get more iron maybe we'll go kiss Belonkin or

83
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,150
something you know we could do that well let's

84
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,140
oh you have to select the location oh But it...

85
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
Does it show up?

86
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,680
I think it might be...

87
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,900
Hmm.

88
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,500
The music is so nice.

89
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
See, forget it off of me.

90
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,160
Yeah, exactly.

91
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,620
I've been collecting more lavender because I like it in my
home.

92
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,280
I collect the lavender.

93
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,060
Thank you for the redog.

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
How's an audio, by the way?

95
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,220
Let me know if I need to turn it up.

96
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh, it's overgrown in here.

97
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,020
Am I even going there?

98
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,320
Kind of.

99
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,640
We'll just walk to the water.

100
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,380
What I'm going to do?

101
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm going to turn up the volume or the music.

102
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,360
Oh.

103
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:06,940
Oh.

104
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,340
we could do

105
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:32,930
85 and I follow the river

106
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:56,420
I think one thing about this game that makes it like I'm
still so Minecraft brained right one thing though that you

107
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,400
have to like I don't know that I wish it were more like
Minecraft is that

108
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:15,920
It's just that I wish it were easier to place down like a
crafting table.

109
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,400
What is happening here?

110
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,620
I've put him out of his misery?

111
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,640
How strange.

112
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,400
You're awesome.

113
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,180
I won't be able to go to your concert in person since my
family is taking me to Mexico.

114
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Oh my gosh, have fun, King of Trash.

115
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,800
Happy birthday, sorry I missed it.

116
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,200
Happy happy birthday.

117
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
There's a little thing over there.

118
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,580
Like a little house.

119
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,080
What are these structures?

120
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,500
Is this like a watchtower, I guess?

121
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,740
Wait...

122
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,840
Oh yeah, I guess.

123
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,120
Let's go kill him.

124
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait, what the heck?

125
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,650
Cray, I made it.

126
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,150
He's a witch, but the five gifted thank you.

127
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Again.

128
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,380
Blue forest.

129
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,750
Big bird.

130
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,590
I like this kind of looking up and seeing boards or stuff.

131
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,350
It's pretty fun.

132
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,810
I like that part.

133
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,230
Okay.

134
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,090
It's like the most narrow forest ever.

135
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,410
Ew, green goblin.

136
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh wow.

137
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,500
This is it guys.

138
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,600
This is it.

139
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,080
Very nice.

140
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,760
Don't come after me.

141
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,440
Oh, he's confused?

142
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,940
One thing that I also have an issue with.

143
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,520
Okay, I'm going to show you guys something.

144
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,800
Watch this.

145
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,560
I put down a torch, right?

146
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,740
Now, as you can see in my hand, I have 30 torches.

147
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Where did that torch go?

148
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,060
Oh, all I did was pick it up.

149
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Shouldn't it add to my torch pile?

150
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,620
No.

151
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,740
It makes a new pile.

152
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,500
And then I know also people say to press Z.

153
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,920
You hear that?

154
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,200
That's me pressing Z.

155
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,500
Holding down Z.

156
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,720
It literally doesn't work for me for some reason.

157
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh.

158
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,960
For some reason, I don't know why it doesn't work for me.

159
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,320
So, you know.

160
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,630
Wrong Z.

161
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,090
Yeah, clearly.

162
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,070
It's the wrong Z.

163
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,630
I like to put down things.

164
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,970
Oh, it's a spider's nest now, isn't it?

165
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,390
I think I watched Doki die in one of those.

166
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,710
So, I'm not gonna go in there.

167
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,010
Have you tried removing the Z?

168
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,090
Look at that guy.

169
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,690
That one's fun.

170
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,730
I'm moving the Z, I'm putting it.

171
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,870
Somewhere else.

172
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,710
Now I know there was more blue forest.

173
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,010
I need more iron though.

174
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,030
Trying to upgrade things.

175
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,630
Oh!

176
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,330
Big fall.

177
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,450
This game isn't like normal where you can just dig and find
things.

178
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,390
Or maybe you can.

179
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,810
Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough.

180
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,650
Maybe I gave up too fast.

181
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,910
Here we go.

182
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,210
Oh, foggy.

183
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,770
Pike?

184
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,350
Isn't that a fish?

185
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,250
Ooh, lots of spiders.

186
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,910
Oh, and snakes.

187
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,010
Oh, you don't care about me.

188
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,330
I see some iron down there.

189
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,620
I'm sure it doesn't drop.

190
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,220
I

191
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,410
hate you.

192
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,470
I hate you.

193
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,010
I'll just make a staircase.

194
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,140
Oh, there's a lot down here.

195
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,520
What are those?

196
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,180
Boom shroom.

197
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
That doesn't sound good.

198
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,280
That sounds mean me.

199
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,260
A little dangerous.

200
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,560
If you ask me.

201
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,040
Can I get back up here?

202
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,540
Oh yeah.

203
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,060
What was that?

204
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,540
What was that?

205
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,620
Spider?

206
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,900
I think so?

207
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,360
Spooky.

208
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,400
The music makes it so much scarier.

209
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,120
Oh yeah, jackpot.

210
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,160
Let's go.

211
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,900
I like the way you can see more...

212
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,100
Like, you can see if like a...

213
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,500
Oh, that is a spider.

214
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,300
Oh, shit.

215
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,820
Oh, shit.

216
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,240
Uh-oh.

217
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,240
Wait, what was that?

218
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,180
We just laughed.

219
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,840
You can't...

220
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,780
You can't get me.

221
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,860
Wait, what is that?

222
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,560
Wait, something's coming to get me.

223
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,280
Oh, shoot.

224
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,500
What are you?

225
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,300
Wait.

226
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,700
I can't reach you.

227
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,220
Ouch.

228
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,620
Oh, shoot.

229
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,900
You're so screwed?

230
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,360
Wait.

231
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,780
I killed that guy, though.

232
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,060
Stop.

233
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,680
Stop it.

234
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
Oh, my God.

235
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,120
What are you?

236
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,560
Ew.

237
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,300
Ew.

238
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,120
Couldn't see anything.

239
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh my god.

240
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,660
Not the rat coming over here to finish the job.

241
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,970
It really was a spider.

242
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,950
I'm guessing that's the larva.

243
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,630
Yeah, get out of here, baby.

244
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,580
Oh, there's so much here.

245
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,370
We're gonna have to...

246
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,490
Where's my dirt?

247
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,170
Oh, yeah.

248
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,670
Those aren't gonna grow...

249
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,750
They're not gonna grow up, are they?

250
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,030
I'm gonna have to upgrade my...

251
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,970
thing soon.

252
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,730
My pickaxe.

253
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,950
Also, if you crouch in this game and, like, walk, I think
you can still fall, which is kind of scary.

254
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:00,970
Mm-mm.

255
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,590
Doesn't lock you to the block.

256
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,870
Yeah, it's pretty scary.

257
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,690
Okay, that should be good.

258
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,370
Stop it.

259
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,750
Grab my riches.

260
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,790
How many did I get?

261
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,110
Oh, 22, you guys.

262
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,450
We're killing it.

263
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,730
There's so much in here, actually.

264
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,990
Wait, did I get all of it?

265
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,190
Did I miss out on you?

266
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,090
Run away, babies.

267
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,610
Run away.

268
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,210
I will kill you.

269
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,790
I will kill you.

270
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,710
Oh, shoot.

271
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,450
This damn rat.

272
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,010
The rats are so annoying.

273
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,210
Like, why do you think you're good enough to attack me?

274
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,350
It really pisses me off.

275
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,590
Try not to...

276
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,990
What is that down there?

277
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,810
Oh, it's just lava.

278
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,350
Oh my gosh.

279
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,330
Be careful, everybody.

280
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,820
Just a bet.

281
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,260
I'll have to go back soon, though, because of my...

282
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,540
I don't have my repair kit on me?

283
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,460
Well, I guess we could always, well, I want to make
everything at home.

284
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,800
We could come back and explore down there, too.

285
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,680
Once I have some better armor, since we have a bunch of iron
now.

286
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,110
Deep in the caves, yeah.

287
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,600
Oh, what is that?

288
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,540
Oh, is that just a rat?

289
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:15,200
Who's like, looking at me funny no I thought I was a I
thought it was a mighty creature I wonder if this will lead

290
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:26,620
to another outside world like another exit I mean outside
world I'm just still collecting yeah leave me alone Ew!

291
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,420
Oh, that is a creature.

292
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,460
Oh my god!

293
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,460
Oh my god!

294
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
It was a creature.

295
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,560
More iron underneath?

296
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,180
Oh, you're right, thank you.

297
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,820
Even more.

298
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,780
You think it could- oh, there's so much though!

299
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,640
Oh my gosh, finally!

300
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Iron!

301
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,900
So much!

302
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,520
So much iron!

303
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,520
I should eat.

304
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,900
I should really heal, though.

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,960
Yeah, heal up.

306
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
We're snacking.

307
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,080
In the cave.

308
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
Thanks for this cozy ASMR.

309
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Don't do it.

310
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,040
Don't come after me.

311
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,680
I see you.

312
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,780
I'm just eating my corn.

313
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,080
I cooked this myself.

314
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,130
Sitting in the dark and eating.

315
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,230
Sitting in the dark and eating.

316
00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:03,450
eaten oh my gosh it's so annoying like why i don't know i
don't understand this at all like this confuses the heck out

I don't have like a cold or anything But thank you guys

320
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:42,660
You can have several items in your left hand And quickly
switch them by using Z Oh, is that the intent?

321
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:57,950
I think even if it's a little slower Getting all this is
more important Than not Oh, it's one of those goblin guys

322
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,110
Oh, he's staring right at me Well, he was staring right at
me Come here.

323
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,110
Oh,

324
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,870

325
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,580
Come here.

326
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,460
Come here.

327
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,180
What are you?

328
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,880
You're like a monk?

329
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,260
Oh.

330
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,560
Okay.

331
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,740
Oh, shoot.

332
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:25,530
Yeah.

333
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,910
That's what I say to you.

334
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,370
Give me your...

335
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,470
I like that you...

336
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,510
When you kill a thing, you get linen scraps.

337
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,450
It makes me feel like I'm stripping them naked.

338
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,940
Okay, we're gonna give up on the copper for now.

339
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,080
How much copper?

340
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,900
Only nine.

341
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,580
That's okay.

342
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,600
It's a fan of me announcement.

343
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,100
Oh, can't wait to see you there.

344
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,380
Thank you, Sarcic.

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,800
Thank you.

346
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,780
See you there.

347
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,480
You don't like it, though, that you're stripping them naked?

348
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,760
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,760
Bat, you scared me.

350
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,240
Take that.

351
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,500
Take my...

352
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,160
Angler.

353
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,740
The torches are really bad in this game.

354
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,980
I'll also say that.

355
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,480
They don't do anything.

356
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Oh.

357
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,900
I don't know if there's any parry mechanics.

358
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,740
We could try next time.

359
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,700
I should probably head back though.

360
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,980
It's probably nighttime though.

361
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,680
I'll show you the mine I tried to create before.

362
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,820
Oh my god, yes, I'm overflowing.

363
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,540
Also, another...

364
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,860
Sorry, I don't mean to only say complaints about this game.

365
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,220
Because obviously I'm still playing it, so I'm having a lot
of fun.

366
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,360
But, um...

367
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,540
Is, uh...

368
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,320
To smelt things.

369
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,020
It requires so much...

370
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,500
Wood.

371
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,700
So much wood.

372
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,140
And it doesn't matter if they're sticks or logs, they go
about the same.

373
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,120
They're like...

374
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,260
What is that stair?

375
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,040
Oh, that's a larva.

376
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,460
Okay.

377
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,080
Sorry, I killed your mom.

378
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,620
Okay, let's leave.

379
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,020
They can come back.

380
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,180
I'll leave my torches.

381
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,400
Oh, what is that?

382
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,220
Oh, there's two of them.

383
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,980
Oh, come on.

384
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,200
Oh, shoot.

385
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,460
Yeah.

386
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:15,770
Yeah.

387
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,950
Yeah.

388
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,730
Ouch.

389
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,130
I forget the swing twice.

390
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,810
Oh, sometimes.

391
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,750
Yeah.

392
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,550
Die.

393
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,110
Could be re-invalence.

394
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,090
Yeah, it's just like, you know, I know the game obviously is
still in early access and everything.

395
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,210
I'm gonna go down there.

396
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,210
But it's my, like, initial, like, complaints.

397
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,390
No biggie.

398
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,690
Nothing that's, like, making me hate my experience or
anything.

399
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,390
Now, we might have to just use my dirt.

400
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,060
Perfect.

401
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,960
There's much more that I like about the game.

402
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,900
Oh, hello.

403
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,840
He choked me.

404
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,080
Dang.

405
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,780
Sick moves.

406
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,870
What are your thoughts on Mint?

407
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:49,690

something about her that ain't right don't notice me why are

408
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:56,680

way we'll go around

409
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,240
we're gonna eat some meat

410
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,070
oh it's a bear i don't want to deal with the bears

411
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,900
You are the baddie.

412
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,740
I'm a baddie.

413
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,500
I'm a baddie.

414
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,000
Green goblin.

415
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,640
Bear.

416
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,720
There's too many dangers in the woods.

417
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,220
Let's hide up there.

418
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,460
Little house.

419
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Right for the taken.

420
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,460
Hold on.

421
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,100
Hold on.

422
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,520
Hold your horses.

423
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,320
Oh, that was pretty.

424
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,940
Oh.

425
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,160
Yeah.

426
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh, yeah.

427
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,500
Oh, yeah.

428
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,340
A memento's in, like, for food.

429
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,720
I like mint.

430
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,000
The flavor.

431
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,200
Yes.

432
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,800
Wooden shield.

433
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,120
That's cute.

434
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,110
Look how cute this cottage is.

435
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:44,540
want to take it wait I should get wood that I can replace
for my place I could start fixing my own place looks like a

436
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,800
fixer-upper that never deterred me I can fix her right

437
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,640
now 100 fiber equals 50 coals and 106 equal 50 coals
difference is the time to get the coal.

438
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,440
Hmm.

439
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,640
Wait, what do you mean, fiber?

440
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
Like this?

441
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,240
The plant fiber?

442
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,700
Well, I didn't know you could burn that.

443
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,880
I've been burning logs and stuff.

444
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,710
Uh-oh.

445
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,610
Am I out of space?

446
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,190
I can get... I have so much moss at home.

447
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,710
I have so much moss.

448
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,530
You can...

449
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:31,930
Oh.

450
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,590
I don't like being out of dark because it's scary.

451
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,090
There's big baddies.

452
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:40,790
Ocean.

453
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh, we lived.

454
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,050
Peppermint or spearment?

455
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,130
I like them both.

456
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,930
Follow the river.

457
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,350
Down, down, down.

458
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,070
By the river.

459
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,660
This game is pretty fall asleep and block game speedrun what

00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,470
Wait, does this place also...

463
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,350
Oh, he's back.

464
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,510
What's why?

465
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,300
Well, if I die, I'll just respawn right there.

466
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,150
Woo!

467
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,080
Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

468
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,940
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

469
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,490
We didn't die.

470
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
Oh, I was like, what's that sound?

471
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,040
Oh, that's like the sound of me dying.

472
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,580
Oh,

473
00:36:59,540 --> 00:36:59,540
wait.

474
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,560
I have these.

475
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,010
Uh.

476
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,370
Oh, it's raw fish.

477
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,650
I don't need bone fragments.

478
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,230
Oh, wait.

479
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,030
Uh.

480
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,710
My stairs.

481
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:22,990
No, what?

482
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:23,690
No, I'm not.

483
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,470
There we go.

484
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,570
Punch up.

485
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,570
versus gold

486
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:49,770
let's go record my memories hello friends give

487
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:01,880
me my stuff give me my things there's

488
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,840
something that about this music and this part that reminds
me of a game actually the whole thing has kind of been

489
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,980
reminding me of like fantasy live.

490
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,860
like, first-person fantasy live.

491
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,820
Classic fantasy RPG vibe.

492
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Minecraft meets Breath of the Wild as it goes into a little
yo yo yo.

493
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,800
I've already seen it.

494
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,690
I'm glad that the fall damage is much more lenient in this
game.

495
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,410
Okay.

496
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,810
I wanna be my friend?

497
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,520
My home!

498
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,200
I wonder if there's any skellies.

499
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,500
They try to take it over every time.

500
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,280
And I say, uh-uh-uh.

501
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,800
It's my home now.

502
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,210
You can turn it off in world settings.

503
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,230
Fall damage?

504
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:44,850
No way.

505
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,550
Oh, it's it.

506
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,270
You guys are so persistent.

507
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,050
You're so persistent.

508
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,210
It's my home now.

509
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,850
It's not your home anymore.

510
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,850
I took it over.

511
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:06,530
It's like my own bone shard farm, so honestly, I don't mind.

512
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,870
There's only two of them anyway.

513
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,370
There's only two of them.

514
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,350
Who cares?

515
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,320
Yay!

516
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,890
See, it looks a die so far.

517
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,670
I had to fill up some holes.

518
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,090
And then I remade the hole.

519
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,280
Essence farming.

520
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,180
I still don't know what to do with the essence.

521
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,460
I'll add it together.

522
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,680
I really didn't grab that much now, did I?

523
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,580
But we have lots and lots of iron to make.

524
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,340
Exciting.

525
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,560
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

526
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,660
Look, I already have 15.

527
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,960
Which isn't that much either.

528
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's just do the charcoal for now.

529
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,240
Oh, never mind.

530
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,120
We'll do my logs for now.

531
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,460
Is this the same world you played with Matara?

532
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,800
No, this is my own that I created.

533
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:56,360
to go explore in the world without her so and i have oh i
gotta repair my items but i have been cutting down these

534
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:05,700
trees once i once i break this i'll get rid of it i still
don't know exactly what to do with items that are broken and

535
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,030
i don't want them anymore like you know i don't know what to
do with them

536
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,320
colonizes skeletons home and kicks them off their land well
they should have taken better care of it and disrepair.

537
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,440
I'm modernizing it.

538
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,590
It's crumbling down.

539
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,360
Thank you.

540
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,240
These guys just came from nowhere.

541
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,220
I don't know where their parents are at all.

542
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,520
Where are your parents?

543
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,800
Where are your parents?

544
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,900
Don't go into the sea.

545
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,410
He'd rather drown than be with me.

546
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,650
I want to build the farming thing.

547
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,510
I need to build the bridge.

548
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,570
But, um...

549
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,630
so that I can have animal friends.

550
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,150
Wait, what's this?

551
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,310
Oh, you can get a shovel?

552
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,210
Oh.

553
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,400
I thought it was fake.

554
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,140
Oh.

555
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,140
Because I...

556
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,920
Oh, wow.

557
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,420
Nice.

558
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,720
I've just been...

559
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,280
using the pickaxe for everything, but this makes multiple.

560
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,580
Okay, but I feel like I need armor before I need anything
else.

561
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,740
I just don't want head armor, because I think it's ugly.

562
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,600
But we'll get the cure ass.

563
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,000
6 out of 100?

564
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,620
Azure logs, are those the ones in the blue woods?

565
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,240
Oh, I look so cool now.

566
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,480
Oh, damn.

567
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,660
Did it take off my clothes?

568
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:56,720
okay that's fine sure I'll let you do that it's my favorite
mechanic in the game I don't know maybe that it's like

569
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:10,040
Minecraft you can hide the armor well now I'm now I'm more
buff I feel more I feel I feel better a little bit And I

570
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,700
really like on my daggers.

571
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,000
But maybe I should have a sword too just in case.

572
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,880
Oh, I need more light leather.

573
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,340
Wait, what's this?

574
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,260
Medium.

575
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,880
How do I get light leather?

576
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,140
Pray throughout the wilds.

577
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,300
I think we gotta go kill some animals.

578
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:40,770
Small animals.

579
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:41,730
Oh, like a bunny.

580
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,160
Spider?

581
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,380
Oh, he does come after me.

582
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:28,720
Yeah?

583
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,060
Ew.

584
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,880
I don't like the way that they die.

585
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,100
It's too realistic.

586
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,540
Where is your mom?

587
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,070
Where are the animals?

588
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,310
Uh-oh.

589
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,390
That's kind of scary.

590
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,410
When there's nothing around.

591
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,710
I think I see a boar over there.

592
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,890
Hakuna Matara, Hakuna Matara, Hakuna Matara.

593
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,250
We did get light hide.

594
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:11,770
Let's go.

595
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,590
Okay, I don't think a bear would have light hide.

596
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,130
What about a squirrel?

597
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,280
He dies with his eyes closed so peacefully after I stab him
to death.

598
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,960
So sad.

599
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,240
Okay.

600
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,540
Squales don't give anything.

601
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,190
An ugly little skellie man should die.

602
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,870
Actually, let's get the sheep.

603
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,490
Hello, sheep.

604
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:44,510
Bye.

605
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,130
Nice.

606
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:52,690
Yes.

607
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,770
Get rid of your entire population.

608
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,290
Yep.

609
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,050
You too.

610
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,070
Oh!

611
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,350
Holy cow.

612
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,770
We're good.

613
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,790
The skies are getting dark.

614
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,930
I think God is angry at me.

615
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,570
Hot dog.

616
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,090
And I think God is angry at me.

617
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,150
I went to Japan, not Kibo, a maid cafe for his time
recently.

618
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,570
Studying paid off that I was able to talk to the maid in
Japanese the entire time, but right now I'm only at the

619
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,430
level where she started washing dishes halfway.

620
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:31,570
Huh?

621
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:35,570
Somebody!

622
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,590
You can do it!

623
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,570
You can do it!

624
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:47,510
They yell, they say no!

625
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:48,970
No!

626
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,030
What's that up there?

627
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,930
Another mysterious structure.

628
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,130
I haven't really explored the area, so there's a lot of
things that are quite new to me.

629
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,720
Wait, this is probably not a small hide, is it?

630
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,620
Oh, it is a light hide.

631
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,100
Awesome.

632
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,480
They sense their intent.

633
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
This is...

634
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,070
This is a funny way to, uh...

635
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,290
Oh, it's a watchtower.

636
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,010
That's a funny way to spawn, though, isn't it?

637
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,090
No, no, no.

638
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:35,850
No.

639
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,790
What even is this way?

640
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,830
The ocean.

641
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,890
I'm like actually trapped.

642
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,570
What the heck is this?

643
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,370
Why is it so dark?

644
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,390
Pop them to say hello.

645
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:53,790
Hello.

646
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,360
Take it easy.

647
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,350
You can see it from here.

648
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,150
How the heck do I even get up those?

649
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,470
Ibu.

650
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,110
Like, it's so high compared to the one...

651
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:17,950
Oh my god!

652
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,910
It's all lava!

653
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,230
Compared to the one that Matara and I found.

654
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,130
Mine's, like, actually evil.

655
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,270
Who's yelling at me?

656
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,540
Evil...

657
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,820
Like, I heard another guy.

658
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,000
But I also see something in the water, you see that?

659
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,340
It's menacing.

660
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,020
Extremely menacing.

661
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,920
It's really scary looking, actually.

662
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,400
Maybe it's just rocks.

663
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:03,900
Just kidding.

664
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,120
Oh, I'm watching the lava drop.

665
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:09,940
There's more...

666
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,260
There's so much lava.

667
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:20,620
House.

668
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,230
House with a view.

669
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:29,890
Holy.

670
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,860
Glad you're still here with the two things today.

671
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,980
Hope for a better tomorrow.

672
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,460
for a minke ghost-o-she.

673
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,500
Ghost-she.

674
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,360
Thank you.

675
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,200
I always said, too.

676
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,280
Usually, the first day is the worst day for me, so...

677
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,900
I should feel better tomorrow, I think.

678
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,360
Like, what is...

679
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,100
Do you see that?

680
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,220
Like, it's, like, twinkling almost up there.

681
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,600
What could that be?

682
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,580
The area is so...

683
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,360
ominous.

684
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,820
So ominous.

685
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,420
So curious, though.

686
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,540
Once I have a better armor.

687
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,460
I felt, you know, the enemies in this game are kind of
stupid.

688
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,320
So if they aggro on one of you all you have to do is block
and then you can live.

689
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,620
But I don't trust going by myself.

690
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,200
Nice.

691
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,100
Where'd the other guy go?

692
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,680
There you are.

693
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,380
Oh, don't run away.

694
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,460
You can't run from me.

695
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,660
It's good for teamwork.

696
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,200
Very good for teamwork.

697
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,220
The smallest marsh ever.

698
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,000
I like these trees.

699
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,800
They're really funny.

700
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,500
The ones with the curly cues.

701
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,840
Wait, where'd it go?

702
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,380
Oh.

703
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,600
It's appeared.

704
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,280
I see.

705
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,360
Oh.

706
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,440
What am I still grabbing?

707
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,240
Where did the nickname Minky come from?

708
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,940
What a great question.

709
00:53:43,520 --> 00:54:02,300
The nickname Minky I think it originally came from Mint
Eddokie and then transformed into Minky.

710
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,220
Because it's also like...

711
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,020
Mint monkey.

712
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,980
So it kind of works.

713
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,400
Oh look, there's stuff in the water.

714
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:20,720
Oh.

715
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,300
Wait, what is it?

716
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,200
Are these seashells by the seashore?

717
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,020
Oh, how cute!

718
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,620
You know, I haven't really been swimming in this game very
much.

719
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,940
For a good reason.

720
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,080
Holy...

721
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,280
Did you guys see those?

722
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,960
What the fuck?

723
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,900
What?

724
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,440
Is that like a mosasaurus?

725
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,180
What is that?

726
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,840
Oh my god!

727
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,120
They don't look friendly.

728
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,000
I don't know.

729
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,220
Or maybe they're whales.

730
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,380
Holy!

731
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,520
There's so much below the surface.

732
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,960
You can't see anything.

733
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,820
You would never know.

734
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,220
No.

735
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,220
You would never know all of this is below.

736
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,910
That's crazy.

737
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,250
Crystalline depths.

738
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,230
What?

739
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,570
I see like creatures like walking around up there.

740
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:36,570
There's...

741
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,830
How would I even survive up in there?

742
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:44,630
If that much lava is overpouring, I almost wish I could fly
above it, you know?

743
00:55:45,530 --> 00:56:01,420
it out i wonder when we learn how to swim underwater breathe
underwater that was crazy i didn't know that there was life

744
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:14,140
under the water wait so when when mitara and i were like
swimming over the water that was all underneath us maybe

745
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,640
Wild.

746
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,630
Under, Darcy.

747
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,010
There's two wolves here.

748
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:35,030
All these sheep and they don't care.

749
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,790
Under, Darcy.

750
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,690
Probably sharks too, most definitely, right?

751
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,910
I think what I do like about this game, though, is that
there's enemies at all levels.

752
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:06,490
times of day because in minecraft it makes me get too
comfortable in the daytime you know and then at night i'm

753
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:19,830
like a little i'm a little freak about it i'm like so scared
life finds a way but in this game i can be like and it makes

754
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:26,690
it also it helps with like not having because you know in
minecraft at night it can become pretty unbearable in some

755
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:35,650
situations where it's like there's just onslaughts of
enemies on top of you i haven't really had to deal with that

756
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:42,830
in well maybe just a little bit there are different enemies
at night in this game too like the creepy crawly ones i

757
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:55,190
don't like those guys but also i wish you had um in
minecraft there's the sound like the sound thing in the

758
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,710
bottom right I wish that was in this game too.

759
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,150
Because sometimes I don't know what a sound means.

760
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,930
Yeah, you could see their glowing eyes.

761
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:07,770
Yeah, that was fun.

762
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,640
I wonder if all my iron...

763
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:21,020
Well, it's probably not done because I probably ran out of
stuff to to cook it.

764
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:21,320
Wait.

765
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:22,900
Is this the...

766
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,680
This isn't the river.

767
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,060
Wait, what's that black building?

768
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,860
Is that this?

769
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,820
No, it's this.

770
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:29,940
Wait, what are those?

771
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,910
That guy just spawned in.

772
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,690
There's two of them.

773
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,210
Whoa.

774
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,720
Oh, is this one of those...

775
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,040
Wait.

776
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,500
This spawn's so weird.

777
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,540
Oh, it's the work in progress dungeon.

778
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,120
Oh.

779
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,180
It spawned so strangely.

780
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,700
Does it say work in progress in here still?

781
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,500
That doesn't even say.

782
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,060
Because it spawns so funny.

783
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,700
It doesn't even say that's a work in progress.

784
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,840
It just is like a ruins.

785
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,080
Pardon our dust.

786
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,040
Is this one actually...

787
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,530
able to be accessed?

788
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,940
This one is.

789
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,260
Wait.

790
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,020
Can I take anything of here?

791
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,440
Oh, you can.

792
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,220
I could just dismantle this entire building.

793
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,820
Some kind person in the comments said how this is supposed
to be pronounced.

794
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,500
It's not how Matara was saying.

795
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,560
Like a brazier.

796
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,820
It's like a brazier.

797
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,440
Brazier.

798
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,460
Take the sign.

799
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,600
No, it can't be our house because apparently...

800
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:31,980
Oh, wait.

801
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:32,540
Maybe...

802
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,740
But if you're too far away from your bed, you'll respawn at
spawn.

803
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:47,520
And it could be that that's why when I died that one time, I
didn't spawn back at our base.

804
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,500
Both are acceptable pronunciations, IMO.

805
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:56,680
Hello?

806
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:57,960
Wait.

807
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,980
Where is home?

808
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:04,380
Okay.

809
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,080
That way.

810
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,620
Actually, I should probably...

811
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,280
Probably take this off.

812
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,500
Uh, this.

813
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,860
Oh.

814
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,320
Oh, this is another WIP location.

815
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,180
And then there's lots of eyes.

816
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,120
Oh, gosh.

817
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,920
This place is... Okay.

818
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,100
It's two different.

819
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,380
Holy moly.

820
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,920
Interesting.

821
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,080
And what's that place?

822
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,200
Hmm.

823
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,780
That looks like a goblin fortress or something.

824
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,400
This too.

825
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,360
Like a goblin fortress.

826
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,270
Ow.

827
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,610
I won't hurt you, baby.

828
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,130
You grow up and be nice and strong so I can come back.

829
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,600
Brazier.

830
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,480
Breezier.

831
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,100
Is this the river?

832
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,380
I think I'm...

833
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:20,600
No.

834
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,080
confused of other places.

835
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,480
They kind of do look quite similar sometimes.

836
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,060
You can do it.

837
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,000
I can...

838
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,700
Oh, there we go.

839
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:43,030
Breezy air.

840
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,550
Easy breezy, beautiful.

841
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,290
Love a girl.

842
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,920
There's another place here.

843
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:10,500
Ouch.

844
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,860
Another monument.

845
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,470
No, this is not the same place.

846
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,530
I can't tell anymore.

847
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,690
Oh, it is.

848
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:39,150
The map looks so big and so small all at the same time.

849
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,270
That means we're close to home.

850
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,930
I really didn't venture off that far now, did I?

851
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,990
I've heard of the Outlanders.

852
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,910
I have, but I don't know it.

853
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,110
Only heard of it.

854
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,480
My home.

855
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,760
We'll finish cooking.

856
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,180
and then we can go explore those scary areas.

857
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,100
Hello, fishes.

858
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,180
Hello.

859
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:17,900
Oh, guys.

860
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,320
They die so easily.

861
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:20,820
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

862
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,020
I can't.

863
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,020
I don't like looking at their little faces.

864
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,420
They're like eyes closed.

865
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,260
Makes me so sad.

866
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,760
Any visitors?

867
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,530
None right now.

868
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:43,010
So at one point I did try to cave.

869
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:53,740
I didn't get very far before being like, I think I should
just find a cave.

870
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,140
I was like, mmm.

871
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,560
Nice cave.

872
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:02,760
Thanks.

873
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,600
Oh, I knew it.

874
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,200
Oh, I knew it.

875
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,480
Wait, we have a hundred of these.

876
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,640
Then we can make some food too.

877
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:28,990
Salad.

878
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,090
Lettuce!

879
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:32,310
Ooh.

880
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,100
Stamina boost.

881
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,300
Oh, I need a type of mushroom.

882
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,100
I hope I didn't, like, get rid of a nice mushroom.

883
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:57,920
Okay.

884
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,860
I thought I had some cool-looking ones that I forgot about.

885
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,000
Rabbit food.

886
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:05,980
Yeah.

887
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:14,490
Alright, that's nice and well.

888
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:19,610
Let's do our tanning rack as well.

889
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,300
There's no hot dog, but it'll do.

890
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,260
That'll do, Donkey.

891
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:38,960
That'll do.

892
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,920
I think I have that in here.

893
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,680
My bones.

894
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:07,310
Sometimes, like, sometimes I'll try to put all, I wish that
it would, like, put all the things that, like, for example,

895
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,950
I had the venom sacks down here.

896
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:10,830
I wish they would go in.

897
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,430
If I are, you know what I mean?

898
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,880
I wonder if you can cook with lava.

899
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,180
Get buckets and buckets full of lava?

900
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:29,700
Nice.

901
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,210
Okay, so now with this, I...

902
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,310
Oh, wait.

903
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,250
What if I just make a new pickaxe?

904
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,030
No, I think about it.

905
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,130
That might be better.

906
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,750
I could make an iron one.

907
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,430
Gray old cheek.

908
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,990
NPC also resets every 6 a.m.

909
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,410
in games so you could buy a recipe.

910
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,130
I forgot about that.

911
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,570
Buying the recipes.

912
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,740
Sorry, I have a bit of a method to my madness and I can't
quite remember it.

913
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,160
I can't quite remember what I do.

914
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,480
My method is flawed, maybe.

915
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,500
Wait, where'd that hide go?

916
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,480
Oh, here it is.

917
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:49,710
I might see more good eyes but i'm really not oh yeah i do
need more of these azure logs oh yeah baby oh yeah oh yeah

918
01:08:55,130 --> 01:09:00,720
check the container options to auto add similar items

919
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,440
Oh!

920
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:23,870
Oh!

921
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,930
Sort button found!

922
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,750
It was right beneath my note.

923
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:28,810
Wait a second though.

924
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:37,760
Oh!

925
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:37,880
Da-da!

926
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:38,680
Oh!

927
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,940
Dark temple brothers.

928
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,940
We'll put this outside.

929
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,140
for anybody who thinks of coming in.

930
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,220
They'll think twice.

931
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,820
Yeah, it's very menacing.

932
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:13,920
Very cool.

933
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,240
Look at that guy over there.

934
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,200
What do you think they're looking for?

935
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,460
It's also kind of nice that you can see them with the
torches.

936
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,600
Like they hold torches themselves.

937
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:30,200
So I don't feel like I'm going to accidentally walk into one
in the forest.

938
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,760
Get a home!

939
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,640
My place looks pretty nice though, doesn't it?

940
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,520
For some place that I just found.

941
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,000
And stoves.

942
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:47,760
Yeah.

943
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,300
Soft wood roof flat.

944
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,720
I just don't know how much, how did so much dirt get here?

945
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,440
You know what I mean?

946
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,490
I'm slapping it with dirt.

947
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,310
Are you comfy for something you pillaged?

948
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,190
Yeah, exactly.

949
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:30,390
Oh my gosh, I just noticed the moon though.

950
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,650
It looks really dorky, I'll be honest.

951
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:33,650
But the stars?

952
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,100
I think it's a BNG.

953
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:13,020
I was just trying to get that.

954
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,020
There we go.

955
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,340
Alright, let's check this out.

956
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,040
Oops.

957
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, good job, Mia.

958
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,920
We'll find something that matches the vibes later.

959
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,700
No, don't do that.

960
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:56,720
Yeah.

961
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,220
Perfect.

962
01:12:59,800 --> 01:12:59,960
Yep.

963
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,440
And then we got this half slab.

964
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,370
Oh.

965
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,710
It's not.

966
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:11,610
what I thought would happen.

967
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,730
Oh, headache and I aches.

968
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,950
I wear glasses.

969
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:18,770
Couldn't see the stars until I took them off.

970
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,290
Very nice.

971
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,890
Thanks for watching.

972
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:24,670
Oh, I should reset my home.

973
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,090
My bed, I mean.

974
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,470
Very good.

975
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,390
Very good.

976
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:38,850
Very, very good.

977
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:43,910
I wonder then.

978
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,270
I see.

979
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:57,460
And then if I, like, had a maybe like this bad boy, right?

980
01:13:59,260 --> 01:13:59,560
Wait.

981
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,120
Wait.

982
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,680
Why wouldn't it let me?

983
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,840
Let me put it in.

984
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,000
Maybe I don't...

985
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,760
Maybe I only have one slot unlocked?

986
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:20,540
Look, you said she ended up renting two servers for Hytale.

987
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,460
I wonder if Mint and others will eventually be playing on a
dedicated one.

988
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,980
I would love to do that.

989
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,660
There's about a PC, camera, microphone.

990
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,980
It's a lot of money.

991
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:35,800
Good luck.

992
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,920
Yeah, Dorko, feel better.

993
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:43,660
Feel better.

994
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,020
Wow.

995
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,660
Get rid of Saliza.

996
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,960
Only light and shields for now.

997
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,040
Oh, okay, okay.

998
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:03,400
I do have a shield, albeit not a great one, but it's...

999
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,440
I found this one.

1000
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,960
Oh, wait.

1001
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:07,640
Oh, yeah.

1002
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,060
Wait.

1003
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,230
Ooh.

1004
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,630
Okay, I'm understanding.

1005
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,350
You're not through yet.

1006
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,790
Keep cooking.

1007
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:33,350
Okay.

1008
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,110
Look, oh wait, I had some sticks in here.

1009
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:45,830
Wait, did that finish?

1010
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:47,510
Oh, wait, that, okay, good.

1011
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,750
And then I did all my tanning stuff.

1012
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,140
Wait, I keep pressing the wrong button.

1013
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,340
Oh, bad.

1014
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,900
It's this side.

1015
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:07,920
Yes.

1016
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,240
Good,

1017
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:19,970
good.

1018
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:20,810
Good, good, good.

1019
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,270
Let's make...

1020
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:29,110
I wish I could see what it would look like on me, you know
what I mean?

1021
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:34,030
Before I commit...

1022
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,610
What's this one?

1023
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,030
Thorium.

1024
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:39,130
Ingrid.

1025
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:40,930
Cobalt.

1026
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,870
Oh, we've seen these.

1027
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,810
A void heart!

1028
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:46,990
That's what I had!

1029
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,070
I had that thing!

1030
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,620
In the...

1031
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:53,490
Me and Matara server.

1032
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,070
Oh, I had that.

1033
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,590
Greater Denizen of the Void.

1034
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:02,930
I had the Void Heart.

1035
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,020
Those guys were pretty freaky.

1036
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,380
But I feel like I could maybe do it on my own.

1037
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,200
Alright, let's make a sword.

1038
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,200
Also, I noticed you need the Venom Sacks to upgrade your...

1039
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,620
Blacksmith.

1040
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,580
And linen scraps.

1041
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,240
I need to kill more people.

1042
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,460
And this is like crazy.

1043
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:52,680
Whoa.

1044
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,420
Stack of iron bars.

1045
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,360
Yeah, you know.

1046
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,020
Iron bar horizontal.

1047
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,980
I haven't really gotten into the building of anything,
obviously.

1048
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,560
Cool too.

1049
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,620
Wait, I want to see what the...

1050
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,300
Oh, my bad.

1051
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,900
What the Azure...

1052
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,180
Once.

1053
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,940
You can't use an Azure log for anything?

1054
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:20,580
No!

1055
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,240
That would be so pretty.

1056
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,200
We can upgrade my...

1057
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:37,900
My workbench.

1058
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,240
Oh, yes, let's upgrade Iron Hatchet.

1059
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,020
Craft.

1060
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,130
Pickaxe, craft...

1061
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,180
Hammer!

1062
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,540
It used to alter the appearance of structural building
blocks.

1063
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,150
Oh, this is...

1064
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,260
Whoa!

1065
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:58,640
Whoa.

1066
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,860
Shovel.

1067
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,020
Why not?

1068
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,620
Hammer time.

1069
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,040
Yeah, let's cook these too.

1070
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,630
I mean, why not?

1071
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:25,230
Uh-oh, I'm out of light leather.

1072
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,910
Very cool.

1073
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,970
I guess I just put them in here for now.

1074
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,570
I'm not quite sure.

1075
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,090
Did I hear a guy?

1076
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:45,290
No.

1077
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,610
Sometimes I'll see a big guy out here too, though.

1078
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,930
I must protect my territory.

1079
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:01,420
I wonder in this game if you don't sleep enough nights if
something will, you know, come after you.

1080
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,080
There's these guys over here.

1081
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:03,980
Let's check what they are.

1082
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:04,620
I see them.

1083
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,020
What are you?

1084
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,880
Oh, void larva.

1085
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,420
Oh, no, no, come back.

1086
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,320
I can't see anything.

1087
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:21,920
Oh, my God.

1088
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:22,740
Oh, my God.

1089
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:23,440
It's one of these.

1090
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,720
Ew, void crawler.

1091
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,720
You're the worst.

1092
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,440
scary.

1093
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,440
These guys are sick.

1094
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,100
These guys are actually sick.

1095
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:36,390
Ugh.

1096
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,650
Nasty.

1097
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:39,390
Oh, that's a biggie.

1098
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,480
They're especially cute today.

1099
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,900
Thank you.

1100
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,540
Thank you.

1101
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,900
Sorry, guys, that I'm feeling so crummy.

1102
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,480
So sorry.

1103
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,200
Nice.

1104
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:14,380
We're getting some void essences love to see it well there's
more they're like coming down yeah bed

1105
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:50,640
my monkey feeling crummy my head is so foggy and tummy hurt
and even though I'm just I'm a spirit it's like hard to lift

1106
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,840
my arms.

1107
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,740
What did I say we were gonna do?

1108
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:14,490
It's kind of embarrassing that it shows where I died
multiple times.

1109
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:17,210
I wish it didn't show that.

1110
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:18,170
It's embarrassing.

1111
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,320
Need more life force?

1112
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,220
I think so.

1113
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,620
Let's just head this way.

1114
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,480
Oh, nope, that's my house.

1115
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:30,880
Sorry.

1116
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:31,660
Head this way.

1117
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,800
We'll cut through the swamp.

1118
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,890
I wonder if you can build a boat in this game.

1119
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,400
Because I think...

1120
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,420
Sorry if you can hear there's like somebody's rumbling car
outside.

1121
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,320
Um...

1122
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,080
I'm just gonna swim and hope that no whales get me.

1123
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,640
Wait, if I die in the ocean, what happens in my staff?

1124
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,880
Oh my god, he's just waiting there.

1125
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,400
Oh my goodness.

1126
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,080
They seem almost friendly.

1127
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,880
You can right click on the death markers on the map to
remove them.

1128
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,280
You can?

1129
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,240
Because it is kind of embarrassing.

1130
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,440
Oh my goodness, thank you.

1131
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,260
Okay, oh it's nice that you can select it though if you're
like...

1132
01:23:59,140 --> 01:23:59,400
Oh!

1133
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,160
I died!

1134
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,000
Oh nice.

1135
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:05,540
Okay.

1136
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,280
Very cool.

1137
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,720
Swimming, swimming, in the ocean blue.

1138
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,080
The day is hot, the water is cold, in the ocean blue.

1139
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,020
I'm above them.

1140
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,640
That's like coral or something.

1141
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:32,750
What is it?

1142
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:35,970
Front stroke, backstroke, fancy diving too.

1143
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:44,970
Don't you wish it ever had nothing else to do but swimming,
swimming in the ocean blue.

1144
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,030
Mario pipes

1145
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:23,440
Let's get in the little Oh even the water Even the water
here Crazy

1146
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:32,380
Evil water Oh

1147
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,720
there's like a rare mineral So I think that's a rare
mineral, no?

1148
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:52,730
I don't know if we'd have time to get it.

1149
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,520
Oh, it's just copper?

1150
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,120
Oh.

1151
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:01,800
No, it's kidding.

1152
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,600
It's interesting how, like, broken apart it is, right?

1153
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:27,020
If we got up here, we'd have to be, like, jumping around
place to place a bit.

1154
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,160
What the?

1155
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,310
Um,

1156
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,380
I don't think it's supposed to be like that.

1157
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,720
Did they fall off and just sink?

1158
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,100
Do you think they'll notice me?

1159
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,050
It feels like somebody's watching me.

1160
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,260
They can't swim up.

1161
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,880
Poor guys.

1162
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:28,630
Wow.

1163
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,030
Oh, it's so...

1164
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:35,470
Look at that, though.

1165
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:38,230
That looks like some bad news bears.

1166
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,380
Under the sea.

1167
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,780
Under the sea.

1168
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,020
I wish we had a boat, though.

1169
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:53,500
I'm trying to see if there's, like, I mean, maybe I could
start, like, digging up, you know.

1170
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,980
From an area.

1171
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,760
Oh, we're back to normal.

1172
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:00,780
Never mind.

1173
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,160
Definitely.

1174
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,220
Oh, yes.

1175
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:10,960
Huh.

1176
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,240
Never mind.

1177
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,120
Back to bad.

1178
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,080
I feel like...

1179
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,100
Is that a guy?

1180
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,480
Oh, this is like a whole...

1181
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,080
Um...

1182
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,840
Now, what is that?

1183
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,960
That doesn't look so good, now, does it?

1184
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,610
It's a troll?

1185
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:48,310
I wish I had been...

1186
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:05,300
I'm not just taking our little swim through through here
just hanging around truly now if I'm is this like the Min

1187
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:13,400
Island let's see because I don't mind digging up like making
a staircase up I think this is good

1188
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,690
okay this might take a while but

1189
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,310
That doesn't work!

1190
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,690
This is rock!

1191
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,620
What is shield bash?

1192
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,340
Right then left click at the same time.

1193
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,360
I think this is slower guys.

1194
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,060
Let's keep going this way.

1195
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,960
Good to know the other shield bash.

1196
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,340
Yeah, but I don't think you can climb up like Spider-Man
after a while.

1197
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,420
Okay, I have an idea.

1198
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,580
Now that we've collected quite a few blocks.

1199
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:56,340
Also, another thing I miss about Minecraft is being able to
middle click and it giving me that block, you know?

1200
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,860
Whoa, we made it!

1201
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,220
Just don't fall.

1202
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,760
Oh, oh, it's not a feeling I was going to have it.

1203
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,080
The foliage.

1204
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:38,420
They don't hurt.

1205
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,400
But they're pretty.

1206
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,860
I kind of want to harvest them.

1207
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:12,230
My sword.

1208
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,070
Wait.

1209
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:18,590
Oh, I feel like that was pretty close.

1210
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:39,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1211
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:46,980
It's okay.

1212
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,440
Did I actually, how much of my food did I bring?

1213
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:53,240
Uh, a little bit of it.

1214
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:05,560
It's okay if we get, if things go south, Um, all we have to
do is run to the ocean.

1215
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:07,940
Easy peasy.

1216
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:12,340
We just run to the edge of the world, and then, um...

1217
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:13,620
Oh.

1218
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,150
And then it should be okay.

1219
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,560
Yava.

1220
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,160
What am I...

1221
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:26,880
What is this?

1222
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,420
It's like all sand or stuff?

1223
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:30,940
Oh!

1224
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,800
Look, there's real grass here.

1225
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,100
Oh my god, and a guy.

1226
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,020
Burnt a zombie.

1227
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,960
Oh my goodness.

1228
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:46,960
Oh, okay.

1229
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:47,500
Ouch!

1230
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:47,740
Ouch!

1231
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:48,180
Ouch!

1232
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:54,140
My shield is already...

1233
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,000
Done, though.

1234
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:01,400
My bed

1235
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:05,790
is obstructed.

1236
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:09,810
Wait, why is my bed obstructed?

1237
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,150
There's a house right there.

1238
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,860
Dang, that guy took me out.

1239
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,400
so fast why

1240
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:47,360
didn't I take this place anyway not like I kicked my booty
why is my bed obstructed unless someone's standing on it do

1241
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,440
you think one of the scaly men is standing on my bed right
now

1242
01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:02,900
that guy whoop my butt oh the

1243
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,760
chunk didn't load.

1244
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:14,180
Oh, maybe I was too far in that sense.

1245
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:14,940
Aww.

1246
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,360
There's a new yak family by my house.

1247
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,220
There's probably somebody here, though.

1248
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:22,920
I'm not gonna lie.

1249
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,040
There's probably some skillies in here.

1250
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:35,880
I thought that like putting down my own torches would stop
them from coming in, but stop them from spawning, maybe.

1251
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,480
Yeah, I know.

1252
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,440
Leave me alone.

1253
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:40,940
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1254
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,260
They're supposed to be fixing it.

1256
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,260
Okay, okay.

1257
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,320
It's all good, we know that the game is in early access.

1258
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,700
Maybe I need a helmet.

1259
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,560
Or maybe a better shield at least, huh?

1260
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,880
Oh, I need light leather.

1261
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,440
No.

1262
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,720
My current shield I found.

1263
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,100
I don't even know what the stats are on it.

1264
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,340
Do they have stats, actually?

1265
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,300
I guess it just is...

1266
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,340
Last longer, maybe.

1267
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,000
This wood.

1268
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,620
Okay, let's go kill some things.

1269
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:36,700
For some more leather.

1270
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,260
Wait.

1271
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:40,500
Yuck.

1272
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,720
I don't even know what I lost.

1273
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,820
Maybe not that much.

1274
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:11,620
Hey!

1275
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:17,270
Fight back.

1276
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,640
Do foxes also?

1277
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,180
But the foxes are so cute.

1278
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,440
I mean, everything in this game is so cute.

1279
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:29,780
It's kind of torture.

1280
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:34,440
I know in these games you have to to survive, but it's...

1281
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,340
It hurts.

1282
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,820
Oh, the animals are so cute.

1283
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,240
I like the mold of grass.

1284
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,180
I don't see any other animals.

1285
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:06,460
Friend the elephant, thank you so much for the gift and
thank you.

1286
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:51,370
A spider house on my house?

1287
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,870
Get the hell away.

1288
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,240
It's good though, we need more of the...

1289
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,840
Poison sax.

1290
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,600
Sax, poison saxophone.

1291
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,800
Ouch, they all kick.

1292
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,660
Squales give nothing.

1293
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,360
Where are you going?

1294
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:38,800
Wait, are you a baby?

1295
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,380
I think you're pretty small.

1296
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:54,860
Baby.

1297
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,270
an adult.

1298
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:12,270
Oh well.

1299
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:17,710
He was fast.

1300
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:27,050
Okay, let's try my stuff and cook on my meat.

1301
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:28,730
Oh my gosh.

1302
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:32,390
We lost all our stuff but we still have the coral clamshell.

1303
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:34,170
Oh yeah.

1304
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:36,650
Oh yeah.

1305
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,890
Oh yeah.

1306
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,160
big stretch

1307
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:13,900
big stretch oh my gosh I have so much so you can cook the
vibe right oh you can look at that guy

1308
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:41,210
getting over to where I died there's gonna be such a pain in
the butt oh oh Because we swam so far.

1309
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:44,410
25 other food?

1310
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:01,960
Weird.

1311
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,800
Teleported crafting.

1312
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,340
I don't even know you could do that.

1313
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,900
Oh, the corn!

1314
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:16,600
Thank you.

1315
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,780
I don't even...

1316
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:19,980
I don't even think I've...

1317
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,300
I don't think I'm there yet.

1318
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:23,860
Oh, and in the leather.

1319
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:26,400
Oh, yeah.

1320
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,420
Oh yeah.

1321
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:54,610
Where can I...

1322
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:55,090
Do I have...

1323
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:56,410
Wait, there was that cave.

1324
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:00,410
That I said I wanted to go and get more stuff in.

1325
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:04,110
I wonder.

1326
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:20,810
Maybe if we dig down deeper in there, we can get better
stuff.

1327
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:21,470
Maybe.

1328
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:29,010
Snow area skellies.

1329
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,170
That's how you get the thorium?

1330
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,510
No, not there in the skellies.

1331
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:38,070
With an arrow?

1332
01:44:39,330 --> 01:44:41,290
I don't think skellies drop anything.

1333
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:50,010
Would you rather get a discount at every restaurant in New
York City or discount at every New York electronic store?

1334
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,340
Restaurant?

1335
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,000
Maybe?

1336
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,520
Thorium is deep down.

1337
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:13,460
is in the desert the desert wait which one is the thorium is
that green or blue

1338
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:23,320
green okay the desert

1339
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:33,910
gosh i think it's gonna be a long long road from here

1340
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:55,250
desert is always south Okay.

1341
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,670
To the south, we go.

1342
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:01,110
Shenzhou there, thank you so much for the...

1343
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:01,490
Thank you!

1344
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:05,810
I think I can leave everything here.

1345
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:10,810
Come back for it, maybe, if I need it, you know.

1346
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:14,090

1347
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:20,640
Tree shop?

1348
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,580
Well, I could always cut that, but it's just so I can make
more...

1349
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,000
More torches.

1350
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,100

Hmm.

1357
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,160
Let's...

1358
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:34,260
In fact, while we're here, we'll just craft the...

1359
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,140
Craft them now.

1360
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,920
Whoa, whoa, okay.

1361
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:39,940
That was only 10.

1362
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:40,880
We're 40?

1363
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:41,840
How many was it?

1364
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,040
More arrows.

1365
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,540
I will make more arrows.

1366
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,520
Wait, why is it making so ready?

1367
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:54,440

1368
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:55,760
Oh, okay, never mind, it does...

1369
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,200
Suck of music.

1370
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,500
Oh, my repair kit, that's what I was looking for.

1371
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,580

Oh, wait.

1387
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:01,650
No, just kidding.

1388
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:04,750
medium leather.

1389
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:06,370
What did I think I needed the scrap floor?

1390
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:07,330
No, I'm confused.

1391
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:08,530
Oh, the upgrade!

1392
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
Oh!

1393
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:25,210
You should?

1394
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:27,730
Okay.

1395
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,280
Listen to fire.

1396
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,520
Shadow weave.

1397
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:39,080
Lovely.

1398
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:46,350
Break down some items in the base materials.

1399
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,550
Oh.

1400
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:52,350
Arcanist's workbench.

1401
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:55,090
Oh, is this what I need for...

1402
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,230
Teleport, Hushin?

1403
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:00,810
Alchemist's workbench.

1404
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:01,890
Ooh.

1405
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,700
I wonder if I should make a crossbow.

1406
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,920
I think I'll do that instead of having the rusty iron
shortbow.

1407
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:32,540
Okay, so we still have a few things that we need to do to
prepare for our grand adventure.

1408
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:43,240
The mono-ultra-microscopic silico-volcano-conosis.

1409
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:46,190
It's the longest English word.

1410
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:49,320
What does it mean?

1411
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,500
So we need a linen scrap.

1412
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:57,780
Skellies!

1413
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,480
Skellies, where are you, Skellies?

1414
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:02,600
Skellies.

1415
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,740
Oh, there's one.

1416
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:10,630
Are you?

1417
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,590
How

1418
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:19,610
do you hear me?

1419
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:24,690
And then we need a big hide, or medium hides.

1420
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:26,930
What would be a medium?

1421
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,130
Because these are small.

1422
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,280
Gosh, that's a big squirrel.

1423
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,560
Deer maybe.

1424
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:05,990
I think there were some over here.

1425
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,210
Can't see anything.

1426
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,010
Cut the grass.

1427
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,910
Cut the grass.

1428
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:14,350
Did I raid this place?

1429
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,460
Can't tell.

1430
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,180
I don't think so.

1431
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,160
They sell their buckets.

1432
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:25,520
Oh.

1433
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,100
So sad for you.

1434
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,240
What happened?

1435
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:37,720
Disease caused by inhaling too much volcanic dust.

01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:51,480

I'm totally mistimed this.

1441
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:17,680
Goodness.

1442
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,260
Pet clan.

1443
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,870
I wonder if wolves too.

1444
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,590
The Queebec villages are really cute.

1445
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:38,850
Yeah, yeah, they are very cute when you can find one.

1446
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:42,030
Right out.

1447
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:42,270
Oh.

1448
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,490
Oh, sure.

1449
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,250
Oh.

1450
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:46,590
Oh.

1451
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:49,710
Oh.

1452
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:52,030
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1453
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,940
I got ambushed.

1454
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,840
I got completely... What the heck?

1455
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,700
How is it obstructed?

1456
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:16,780
I wasn't even that far!

1457
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:19,740
Okay, maybe these guys, uh...

1458
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,420
These guys should have a medium.

1459
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,960
I like you can see their udders.

1460
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,390
Oh, hell.

1461
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:40,230
heavy hide.

1462
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:41,710
It's not medium.

1463
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:45,290
I don't have very many heavy hides though.

1464
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,530
Might be good in the ground.

1465
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:01,030
Not the ambush.

1466
01:56:03,970 --> 01:56:06,990
I got completely ambushed.

1467
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,650
That sucked.

1468
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:13,230
I wonder if a bear...

1469
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:17,270
But there's a spider there too, I'm wondering if it's gonna
gang up on me again.

1470
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:21,230
I feel like a bear would be a heavy...

1471
01:56:26,330 --> 01:56:27,210
Holy cow!

1472
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:34,600
Oh my god!

1473
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,660
Oh, I took him out again.

1474
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,480
I don't want to let you...

1475
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:51,400
Heavy.

1476
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:52,400
Okay.

1477
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,680
Maybe deer is our only option.

1478
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,060
There's nothing in between.

1479
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:20,070
Deer is light?

1480
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:20,970
Then what is medium?

1481
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:24,930
What would medium be?

1482
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:30,310
A wolf?

1483
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:30,890
That's it?

1484
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,190
Oh my god.

1485
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:36,710
Oh, I gotta go get my stuff anyway.

1486
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:39,870
How is this obstructed?

1487
01:57:40,710 --> 01:57:41,790
This dang game.

1488
01:57:59,290 --> 01:58:01,330
Cray animals are all light in this version.

1489
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:04,590
Crossbow health.

1490
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:06,610
I think that's what I'm trying to make.

1491
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:09,070
Oh, oops.

1492
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:10,810
Sorry, I always get them confused.

1493
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:13,830
Oh, no, we have the linen scrub is what we need.

1494
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:16,390
What was I trying to make them?

1495
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:18,790
I think I was trying to make the backpack.

1496
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:23,070
Yeah, the backpack is medium.

1497
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:27,950
I obviously have medium, but I don't know if it's because I
found it in the wild or would.

1498
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:35,930
I just need to kill one guy, one skelly.

1499
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:38,650
You're not a skelly.

1500
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:55,350
Yeah, I think probably the chests are where I found it,
because I definitely didn't kill any wolves.

1501
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:57,330
No, that's a lie.

1502
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:58,570
I did kill one dog,

1503
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:08,590
which I might be able to kill those, but I got to get my
stuff back.

1504
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:16,620
Nice.

1505
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,240
Two for one.

1506
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:22,380
Free linen scrap.

1507
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:26,840
Let me see if I can get my stuff back, first and foremost.

1508
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,800
There was like a area where

1509
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:40,240
with some one of the guys.

1510
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,820
Some ogres.

1511
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,880
And they had one dog.

1512
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:54,160
I was able to get him.

1513
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:54,800
Oh!

1514
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:56,060
Hello.

1515
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:06,280
One dog.

1516
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,160
Where is my stuff?

1517
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,280
Is

1518
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,080
this it?

1519
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,580
My stuff.

1520
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:28,780
Now they're all hanging out together, it seems.

1521
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:29,440
What?

1522
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:51,960
okay i thought i saw more stuff you can oh my god i can't i
didn't know i didn't know i would leave a bear oh my god i

1524
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:11,840

1525
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:18,220
now and we just we can go on our event and we get the
crossbow and go on our adventure

1526
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:31,060
devoted to big stick I'm gonna try the deer I believe you
but I still want to see reach them.

1527
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,540
They're fast.

1528
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:36,120
I don't have enough stamina for these guys.

1529
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:40,720
Okay, I give up.

1530
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,500
There is tasty.

1531
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:54,180
Food.

1532
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,200
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1533
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:57,540
Where am I?

1534
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:02,640
Red.

1535
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:04,800
Oh yeah, isn't this area kind of cool?

1536
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:06,500
It looks like a pine cone.

1537
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:12,520
And then It's just a big, big, one single big red tree.

1538
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,760
It's kind of cool.

1539
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,000
Oh.

1540
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:23,150
What is this?

1541
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:25,390
Oh, glowing mushroom.

1542
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:28,110
It does look like a shrine, right?

1543
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:31,470
Like, I haven't touched it because I'm just kind of like,
wow.

1544
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:32,850
Ooh.

1545
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:37,310
I like it for the ambiance.

1546
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:48,610
these guys look like they would be so mean but they're so
nice well not so nice they're just normal but it looked like

1547
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:53,430
they would want to rip my face off but they don't

1548
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:03,470
can you milk them maybe they have otters

1549
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:29,090
nice i think i said i was gonna bring some fiber with me
though We'll leave the shield.

1550
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,550
We got a better shield anyway.

1551
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:35,450
All my armor is like about broke.

1552
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:42,130
Let's...

1553
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:48,150
Fishmen have

1554
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:01,510
medium leather.

1555
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:02,670
They do!

1556
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:04,510
The fishmen!

1557
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:09,910
Um...

1558
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:13,590
Okay, that's huge.

1559
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:22,300
What I need is...

1560
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:23,920
Okay, how do I make more repair kits?

1561
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,860
Because I feel like I'm gonna...

1562
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,580
I will bring my crafting table, you know, obviously.

1563
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:31,600
But, like, linen, scrap, and light leather.

1564
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,860
I feel like I'm gonna be needing to repair so many things
soon.

1565
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,340
Wait, I thought I had a third one.

1566
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:42,060
I thought I was...

1567
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:42,980
Oh, here's some light hide.

1568
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,000
Not too.

1569
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:58,830
Did I...

1570
02:04:58,830 --> 02:04:59,990
I must have put them...

1571
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,150
Oh.

1572
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:03,110
What did I do with my stuff?

1573
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:09,570
I'm always pressing buttons and I'm not paying attention.

1574
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:24,780
Let's go kill some fishmen.

1575
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:31,160
Bye!

1576
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,480
Sixty- not 69 months.

1577
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:40,140
Thank you so much for 21 months.

1578
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,580
It's because your name is 69.

1579
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:50,700
That would be- how much time would that even be?

1580
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,800
Where did those- where did these come from?

1581
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,520
There's a fish man.

1582
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:01,360
Green goblin.

1583
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:02,220
Oh.

1584
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,060
Can you come to me?

1585
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,000
Yeah, yeah, can you come here?

1586
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:11,840
Medium hide.

1587
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:14,580
Let me see your booty.

1588
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,340
Medium hide!

1589
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:28,940
We can do this!

1590
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:29,740
We can do this!

1591
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:30,940
We can make the backpack!

1592
02:06:57,900 --> 02:06:59,180
Oh, there's he, there he is.

1593
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:08,650
This is always a thing when you say, I'm going on a big
adventure, and then sneak attack.

1594
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:12,600
Oh, my bad.

1595
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:17,350
Stop it.

1596
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:18,830
Oh, oh, josh.

1597
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:23,510
You say, I'm going on a big adventure, and then it never
happens.

1598
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:24,130
Is that bear?

1599
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:25,470
Oh, shoot.

1600
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:31,620
I think he's stuck down there.

1601
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:40,920
safe it's a cave here though very interesting

1602
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:51,850
any more of these guys i've noticed that they all kind of
spawn in the same places

1603
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:08,280
i haven't searched this whole area i don't know maybe he can
climb somewhere else or spawn somewhere else well i climb i

1604
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:18,600
climb he spawned climb climb Well, yeah, it's one million
side quests before you get to the big quest.

1605
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:24,320
Wait, what?

1606
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:26,840
Stone?

1607
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,300
Oh, this is a spear.

1608
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,380
I thought it was arrows.

1609
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:32,800
I could have sworn I made arrows.

1610
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:45,780
Oh.

1611
02:08:53,090 --> 02:08:55,130
I can't predict those movements at all.

1612
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:56,490
Thanks.

1613
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:05,090
Ife!

1614
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,880
Oh my god, wait.

1615
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,020
I thought I only had four.

1616
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,240
This is kind of awesome.

1617
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:18,990
Where'd he go?

1618
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:22,860
Oh.

1619
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,780
He's right in front of me.

1620
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:25,840
Oh, cut your miss.

1621
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,780
He's like, why bother me?

1622
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:01,680
Are this guy's going to respawn or what?

1623

bath it was so funny oh my gosh a big bear and spider what

It's fine, I need to heal.

1629
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,820
How much was it for the backpack anyway?

1630
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,280
Ugh, 8 medium leather.

1631
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:01,620
It'll take forever.

1632
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:13,940
daggers to lunge around very fast yeah you like do i think

bunch of sales people i got it

i've because i've I've done that before.

1635
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:54,860
Trying that out.

1636
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:57,520
It's not your fault.

1637
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,900
It's my fault because I knew it would happen.

1638
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:04,080
I just didn't think about it.

1639
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:06,900
Alright, well, we'll bring...

1640
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:07,680
You know what?

1641
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,300
The iron ingot.

1642
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:10,500
We need 10 of them.

1643
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:14,400
Exactly how many we have.

1644
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:17,900
So, we'll bring that and we'll bring...

1645
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:18,160
Oh.

1646
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:19,980
Oh yeah.

1647
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:22,190
What was I saying?

1648
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:25,890
Oh, we just gotta get medium leather on the way.

1649
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,010
What is that?

1650
02:14:34,330 --> 02:14:35,230
Oh, my gosh.

1651
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:39,770
Yeah.

1652
02:14:41,570 --> 02:14:43,630
Oh, uh, oops, I forgot to make arrows.

1653
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:48,510
Wow, I cook.

1654
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:50,010
I cook.

1655
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:51,150
I cook the fish.

1656
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:53,370
I cook the fish.

1657
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:56,330
I cook the fish.

1658
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:03,440
And we...

1659
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,320
Oh, and the meat.

1660
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:05,780
I have so much meat to cook, too.

1661
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:08,660
Okay, we cook a...

1662
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:09,560
We cook a cooker.

1663
02:15:15,450 --> 02:15:17,210
Invisible mosaic is over the roof.

1664
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:34,760
it and then I'll make some arrows where where are they oh
here actually can I make better arrows here oh they are also

1665
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:45,340
crude arrows well dang I guess it's fine I guess it's a fine
I thought I made arrows but I don't know where they I

1666
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:46,680
thought I made them.

1667
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:48,080
But they disappeared.

1668
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:49,640
Like I'm dead.

1669
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:50,340
Serious.

1670
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,940
Oh, here they are.

1671
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,360
They did not disappear.

1672
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,620
It happened.

1673
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:57,020
No, well, thank you so much.

1674
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:58,720
Thank you, thank you.

1675
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,320
First stream I get to catch.

1676
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:06,320
I hope you get well soon.

1677
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,000
Oh, bye, cool straw.

1678
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:09,460
Sorry.

1679
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:10,280
Thank you.

1680
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,440
Thank you so much.

1681
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:13,600
Alright, I think we're good now.

1682
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:15,360
to go on our adventure.

1683
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:22,910
Let's make another...

1684
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:25,050
There we go.

1685
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,750
Repair kit.

1686
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:27,670
That's three that we have on hand.

1687
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:29,070
Alright.

1688
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:29,970
Goodbye, home.

1689
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:32,550
I'll see you when I get back.

1690
02:16:32,990 --> 02:16:34,930
Don't let the skellies overtake you.

1691
02:16:35,610 --> 02:16:36,990
Or any spiders, I guess.

1692
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:51,000
South.

1693
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:02,610
Thanks, guys, for helping us.

1694
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:04,070
out.

1695
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:11,710
Explaining how the memberships work.

1696
02:17:13,890 --> 02:17:14,550
So cute.

1697
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:16,730
I was over here earlier.

1698
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:23,810
It was somewhere around here, but there was like a ship that
I took apart.

1699
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:28,470
I wonder what the ocean looks like here.

1700
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:33,910
We're close to home.

1701
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:36,430
It spawned.

1702
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:37,670
Let's see what happens.

1703
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:47,500
Oh, he's far away now.

1704
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:52,760
I give up.

1705
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:59,540
I like the music under the water, though.

1706
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,380
It's really cute.

1707
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:11,300
The music is very, like, Lord of the Rings sometimes.

1708
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:15,780
It does make me feel like I'm on an adventure.

1709
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:21,980
I hear

1710
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:36,170
A seagull But I see no seagulls Wait, I discovered a A new
fish Lemon peel tang Is that you?

1711
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:44,960
I'm Bilbo Baggins Meantobaggins

1712
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:13,660
Thought I saw A structure over here I'm No, I saw a tree.

1713
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:21,320
South, south we go.

1714
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,980
This is the furthest south I've been.

1715
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:28,860
Oh, is that the desert?

1716
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:31,720
It's yellow.

1717
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:35,340
Hello.

1718
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,160
Welcome to Mambusha.

1719
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:39,820
Thank you.

1720
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:41,220
you're so bad.

1721
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:45,280
I feel bad if it's like your first time catching my stream.

1722
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,720
And I'm so like...

1723
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,040
Hopefully it's kind of cozy there.

1724
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,580
Maybe there's a green goblin in here.

1725
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:10,840
I'll kill him.

1726
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:12,940
Whoa, it's really green.

1727
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:14,300
Stinky.

1728
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:16,840
Stinky in here.

1729
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:19,100
Green Goblin.

1730
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,840
Green Goblin, I would like your medium hide.

1731
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:24,400
What is this?

1732
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:27,060
Oh, it's the blood leaf!

1733
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:31,920
I don't know what we need that for, but I want it.

1734
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:37,400
I feel like I just destroyed the whole thing.

1735
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:44,000
Stinky, stinky, nasty!

1736
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,860
Perfect stream for study time.

1737
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:48,420
Yeah!

1738
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:50,160
For sure.

1739
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,320
I probably should sleep.

1740
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,880
I don't want to have to fight some baddies.

1741
02:20:56,660 --> 02:20:58,340
I'll sleep in the middle of the floor.

1742
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:03,560
Oh, we can't sleep for another two minutes.

1743
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:06,040
I like how it's very specific.

1744
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:08,060
It's pretty funny, actually.

1745
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:11,980
JB!

1746
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:15,320
Thinking of the Lord of the Ring fandom that cuts in the Mr.
Frodo.

1747
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:19,860
If I take one more step line every single time Sam takes a
step on stream.

1748
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:25,460
We could have told that one, but it sounds so funny.

1749
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:29,720
Sneak.

1750
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:30,780
They're so cute.

1751
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:37,160
Oh!

1752
02:21:41,610 --> 02:21:43,290
Come here, Green Goblin!

1753
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:57,820
Yes.

1754
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:02,460
Whoa, the sun reflecting is crazy!

1755
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:04,940
Wait, is that a blue forest over there?

1756
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:06,140
Oh, yes it is.

1757
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,320
Let's go check it out.

1758
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:11,620
What the hell makes that sound?

1759
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,360
Is this the Azure tree?

1760
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,140
Let's try.

1761
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:18,540
Let's try.

1762
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:22,320
Oh, it is the Azure log!

1763
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:29,900
It's mine.

1764
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,340
Oh, come on!

1765
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:40,620
Yeah.

1766
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:49,070
Me when I'm hungry.

1767
02:22:50,390 --> 02:22:50,990
Me right now.

1768
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:51,910
I'm hungry.

1769
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:56,210
The trees like go so deep into the ground.

1770
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:57,150
It's kind of crazy.

1771
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:04,510
I think we're going to pass through one, though.

1772
02:23:05,470 --> 02:23:05,950
Going south?

1773
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:07,480
Yeah, we could just go this way.

1774
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:20,710
The heck is going on in there.

1775
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:22,150
Oh, it's a cave, maybe?

1776
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:24,710
Oh, yes.

1777
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:25,550
Not maybe.

1778
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:29,190
Oh, there's some iron in here, though.

1779
02:23:30,410 --> 02:23:31,170
That's cool.

1780
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:37,120
Can't wait for shader mods in this game.

1781
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:50,500
my gosh it'll go so hard it'll be so beautiful do you even
need well i guess i feel like i would add a little a little

1782
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:52,220
more i

1783
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:11,160
think if i added shaders it would be like a very minimal
experience but because so far it's already so good oh i'm

1784
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:14,000
climbing the tree um monkey moating

1785
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:34,730
Uh-oh.

1786
02:24:35,530 --> 02:24:37,290
Um, I'm already out of room.

1787
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:41,570
It's fine.

1788
02:24:42,290 --> 02:24:43,310
We'll eat some more.

1789
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:46,410
Actually.

1790
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:53,330
The fish is making me hungry the mostest, I think.

1791
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:03,390
Yeah, like, it doesn't need shaders, but I think it needs
shaders at the same time.

1792
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:07,290
feeling.

1793
02:25:07,890 --> 02:25:08,550
I get it though.

1794
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,510
I'm going to throw out my moss.

1795
02:25:11,450 --> 02:25:13,330
Oh wait, yellow moss.

1796
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:14,570
Huh.

1797
02:25:15,550 --> 02:25:15,570
Interesting.

1798
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:20,310
And I like that things are stacked in hundreds.

1799
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:22,330
I feel so cute.

1800
02:25:22,450 --> 02:25:23,670
I love its art style already.

1801
02:25:23,810 --> 02:25:24,290
Me too.

1802
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:25,670
It's so cute.

1803
02:25:34,030 --> 02:25:35,490
Back to the desert.

1804
02:25:36,990 --> 02:25:41,270

Oh, look at him.

1809
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:27,010
He's so cute.

1810
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:29,210
Oh, the little gecko.

1811
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:32,070
He's so cute.

1812
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:35,390
He's so cute.

1813
02:26:35,810 --> 02:26:38,950
Now he's got a fat tail, which means his tail's come off
before.

1814
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:46,320
Oh.

1815
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:48,260
No, please don't see me.

1816
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:49,480
Please don't see me.

1817
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:49,920
I leave.

1818
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:51,060
We're going.

1819
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:51,520
We're leaving.

1820
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:53,640
Oh, gosh.

1821
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:55,220
Ah.

1822
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,960
Everything here is trying to... It's true.

1823
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:00,480
Everything in Australia tries to kill you.

1824
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:05,180
Oh, dang it.

1825
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:10,580
Ugh.

1826
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:13,480
Where's my... Hold on.

1827
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:14,440
Uh, ow.

1828
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:15,200
One second.

1829
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:16,360
One second, please.

1830
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:28,220
Yeah, screw you.

1831
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:34,070
Anyway.

1832
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:36,030
Oh.

1833
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:40,170
I thought that was like a bunch of guys together, but it's
just...

1834
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:44,610
A bunch of, uh...

1835
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:46,450
Not deer.

1836
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:47,730
Antelope.

1837
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,540
It's this area too.

1838
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:54,180
Oh god, we're like in trouble.

1839
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,620
In these areas.

1840
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:57,440
It's the whip dungeon.

1841
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:01,360
I wonder...

1842
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,400
What they'll do.

1843
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:06,980
Like when the game gets out of...

1844
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:10,040
Out of, uh...

1845
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:13,800
Like, what's the word?

1846
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:14,650
I'm trying to say.

1847
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:18,000
Like.

1848
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:20,480
What will happen?

1849
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:23,160
Like, say I'm playing on this server forever.

1850
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:25,880
The Badlands.

1851
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:26,740
We made it.

1852
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:28,700
Wait, what is that structure?

1853
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:32,200
Okay, hold on.

1854
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:33,640
Set my bed.

1855
02:28:41,650 --> 02:28:43,610
You'll need to make a new world, probably.

1856
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:44,710
Probably, right?

1857
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:47,990
I wonder if this guy drops a medium hide.

1858
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:49,430
Hello.

1859
02:28:51,890 --> 02:28:53,510
Oh, so that green thing right there.

1860
02:28:53,610 --> 02:28:55,330
Oh, that is a creature.

1861
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:56,150
Oh.

1862
02:28:56,730 --> 02:28:57,070
Hello.

1863
02:29:00,650 --> 02:29:01,610
Sabertooth Tiger.

1864
02:29:06,810 --> 02:29:09,010
Oh my god, he gets like on top of me.

1865
02:29:11,710 --> 02:29:11,770
Yeah.

1866
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:12,550
Yeah.

1867
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:18,490
At least he's not running.

1868
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:19,270
in a pack.

1869
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:23,550
Oh, we got him.

1870
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,300
What did he drop?

1871
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:35,840
Oh, medium.

1872
02:29:36,060 --> 02:29:38,760
Wait, no, I think...

1873
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:39,260
Oh, no.

1874
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:42,600
Meat and medium hide.

1875
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:43,500
It was medium.

1876
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:46,340
Is that a crocodile?

1877
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:50,400
Wait, what's that right there?

1878
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,560
We go to the other side.

1879
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:11,560
Why is there no music?

1880
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:13,620
Oh, why is this guy...

1881
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:15,740
Cobalt!

1882
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,580
Isn't this the one after Thorium?

1883
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:22,400
Is Cobalt better?

1884
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:31,400
Yeah?

1885
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,120
Okay, cool.

1886
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:35,780
Let's go.

1887
02:30:36,820 --> 02:30:38,160
I think this guy's gonna see me.

1888
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:39,320
Oh.

1889
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:42,840
How many arrows do I have anyway?

1890
02:30:44,380 --> 02:30:44,820
51.

1891
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,320
Okay, screw me.

1892
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:55,300
Yeah.

1893
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:57,240
Yeah.

1894
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:01,120
Yeah, death to you, death to you.

1895
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:02,720
What's killing me?

1896
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:03,660
What's hurting me?

1897
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:07,100
I'm in the desolate... Oh, chill, chill.

1898
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:09,760
What's hurting me?

1899
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,000
Was I poisoned?

1900
02:31:14,140 --> 02:31:14,900
Oh, I didn't notice.

1901
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:15,420
My bad.

1902
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:19,640
Spook in me for real.

1903
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:23,080
That guy looks a little different.

1904
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:25,020
Okay, I'm so scared.

1905
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,900
I feel like I'm in like a bad area.

1906
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:31,500
Holy moly.

1907
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:42,120
That don't sound so good.

1908
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:58,460
Sand swept skeleton soldier.

1909
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:03,060
Okay, so this is...

1910
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:04,200
Holy cow.

1911
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:10,450
Wow!

1912
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:11,890
Boy, this is awesome!

1913
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:16,110
Wait, uh...

1914
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:17,310
Let's see.

1915
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:18,350
Media weather!

1916
02:32:23,020 --> 02:32:24,200
Guys, we got the

1917
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:32,780

1918
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:37,540
uh...

1919
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:38,720
Okay, hold on.

1920
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:41,260
There's so much in here.

1921
02:32:41,740 --> 02:32:43,000
Silver, oh silver.

1922
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:45,060
Okay, wait, ah, shoot.

1923
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:48,820
Oh my goodness, gracious.

1924
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:51,440
What can I get rid of?

1925
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:52,980
Sandstone cobble.

1926
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:55,160
Actually, here's this little mushroom.

1927
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:58,220
Get rid of you.

1928
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:01,180
There we go.

1929
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,200
We're figuring this out.

1930
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:07,660
I'm gonna...

1931
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:08,340
How's my health?

1932
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:09,380
It's not so bad.

1933
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:11,880
Make a chest.

1934
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:14,340
Yeah, but I can't store it in the chest.

1935
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:16,620
Hmm.

1936
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,060
Do we have the backpack yet?

1937
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:18,660
Hold on.

1938
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,340
Wait a second.

1939
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,220
Wait, we can make this.

1940
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:32,040

02:33:59,620 --> 02:33:59,760
Okay.

1944
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:02,200
And also, um...

1945
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:09,550
Moss.

1946
02:34:10,090 --> 02:34:10,810
I don't need you.

1947
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:13,770
Oh.

1948
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:15,410
What does F do?

1949
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:19,230
Besides, like, trying to open stuff.

1950
02:34:26,390 --> 02:34:27,910
I think...

1951
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:28,410
Two?

1952
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:33,480
Four.

1953
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:40,140
other medium at home?

1954
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:41,660
Is that a silly?

1955
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:46,240
We need four more, wait no, we need two more.

1956
02:34:46,340 --> 02:34:47,220
I think it was six.

1957
02:34:51,910 --> 02:34:52,730
Oh, it is eight.

1958
02:34:55,310 --> 02:34:55,970
It's eight.

1959
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:59,810
Oh, do we appreciate it?

1960
02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:02,690
It's okay.

1961
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:05,930
We're not, we're not, don't count us out yet.

1962
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:08,150
Are you bad?

1963
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:09,790
Oh, you're sad.

1964
02:35:14,610 --> 02:35:15,570
Six shots.

1965
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:18,870
Poison again.

1966
02:35:22,190 --> 02:35:23,610
Don't land on me.

1967
02:35:23,970 --> 02:35:24,490
Oh, what's this?

1968
02:35:26,210 --> 02:35:26,430
Ouch.

1969
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,160
Ouch!

1970
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:36,840
Oh, gosh.

1971
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:37,340
I'm gonna die.

1972
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:37,860
I'm gonna die.

1973
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:39,460
Uh, shoot.

1974
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:40,160
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

1975
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:40,900
Where's my...

1976
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:41,440
Oh, my God.

1977
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:41,660
No.

1978
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:42,340
Please.

1979
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:46,920
Ouch, just stop it.

1980
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:50,000
There you are.

1981
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:50,900
Oh my god.

1982
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:02,360
It's okay.

1983
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:03,940
If I die, I'm really close.

1984
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:05,460
I just don't want to lose the durability.

1985
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:06,460
Is this...

1986
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:11,260
Oh, silver!

1987
02:36:18,270 --> 02:36:18,730
Fancy!

1988
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:21,870
And then this is just iron.

1989
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:27,570
Yeah, he is definitely a super annoying enemy.

1990
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:31,950
Like, it's stupid, stupid annoying.

1991
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:36,970
I don't want to, like, get noticed here, so I'm kind of
being...

1992
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:38,270
Trying to be a little careful.

1993
02:36:40,890 --> 02:36:44,410
I don't want to call the horde upon me.

1994
02:36:47,550 --> 02:36:50,210
This place is... This place is so cool!

1995
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:52,810
It's like a little mining factory!

1996
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:54,630
My gosh!

1997
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:57,310
I noticed you.

1998
02:37:00,270 --> 02:37:02,510
Oh, we have so much cobalt ore now.

1999
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:04,250
Oh, gosh, sorry.

2000
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:04,990
Oh, my God.

2001
02:37:06,710 --> 02:37:07,830
You assholes.

2002
02:37:11,930 --> 02:37:13,250
Oh, I lost it.

2003
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:14,250
I wasted it.

2004
02:37:14,330 --> 02:37:14,990
Oh, my God.

2005
02:37:19,850 --> 02:37:20,830
I'm going to die.

2006
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:30,450
Ugh.

2007
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:42,600
I'm in a hole.

2008
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:45,380
Oh, God.

2009
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:52,560
Oh, geez.

2010
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:57,160
So annoying.

2011
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:06,540
Where did he even come from?

2012
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:14,500
I'll burn these because I only have 100 of them here.

2013
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:16,460
Okay.

2014
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:17,740
Holy cow.

2015
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:21,740
Oh, I need my leather thing, don't I?

2016
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:26,910
Ew.

2017
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,130
I need...

2018
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:35,050
I'm gonna make us a little...

2019
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:42,210
A little wall or something.

2020
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:49,300
Maybe the reload time isn't so exhilarating.

2021
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:52,200
One day I'll understand what he meant.

2022
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:57,460
Look, I'm making us a ceiling.

2023
02:39:09,870 --> 02:39:12,430
It doesn't get us out of the hot sun.

2024
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:16,410
What is that?

2025
02:39:20,970 --> 02:39:22,510
Oh, bone fragments.

2026
02:39:24,430 --> 02:39:24,990
Lucky us.

2027
02:39:25,170 --> 02:39:25,910
Oh, look at that!

2028
02:39:26,230 --> 02:39:27,490
It's kinda cute!

2029
02:39:31,050 --> 02:39:32,410
That kinda works!

2030
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:44,020
More bugs.

2031
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:48,620
Well, they're over there, and we're over here, and he's
definitely not flying this direction.

2032
02:39:48,940 --> 02:39:49,040
Yeah.

2033
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:52,220
So we're fine.

2034
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:54,080
For now.

2035
02:40:00,530 --> 02:40:04,010
If I, though, can make some cobalt stuff.

2036
02:40:05,650 --> 02:40:07,610
Like, if we can make a...

2037
02:40:07,610 --> 02:40:09,130
Maybe the armory.

2038
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:22,700
Cobalt.

2039
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,960
Shadow weave scraps.

2040
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:26,300
I need more of that, though.

2041
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:30,860
How do you beat the game?

2042
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,700
I don't think there's a way to beat it right now, right?

2043
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,600
Because it's all early access.

2044
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:39,280
Presumably?

2045
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:41,240
I think?

2046
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:44,600
Famous last words.

2047
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:46,040
No, no, no.

2048
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,160
Not famous.

2049
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:51,080
Then they're not my last words.

2050
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:55,060
They're just words.

2051
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:11,940
Wait, my bed is all the way over the air.

2052
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,300
Wait, careful with uptick.

2053
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:22,460
Graded stations.

2054
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:23,720
Breaking reverts.

2055
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,200
What do you mean by that?

2056
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:26,600
Reverts?

2057
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:28,440
What do you... Reverts what?

2058
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:36,060
You'll need to upgrade the workbench.

2059
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:36,660
For what?

2060
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:39,080
I already did.

2061
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:43,020
It undoes the upgrades?

2062
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:50,160
Oh, that's so stinky.

2063
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:54,860
Wait, why would they even make it like that?

2064
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:00,300
Oh, the upgraded...

2065
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:10,120
materials will drop so it's okay okay i guess it refund
refunds you okay oh then it's not an oversight i don't think

2066
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:15,360
that's a bug then because they wouldn't if it were a bug
they i don't think they would refund you you know

2067
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:25,620
it wasn't like this before i don't know why they changed it
that's so weird yeah it's so annoying oh i hope they changed

2068
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:42,160

said yeah this is the perfect place this is the safest
location that i could possibly have chosen.

2073
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:44,160
I said, yeah.

2074
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,160
I don't need them.

2075
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:49,620
I don't need comfort.

2076
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:53,260
If a guy is, there's going to be a guy.

2077
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:55,920
20 guys on me in two minutes.

2078
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:56,860
Whatever.

2079
02:43:57,060 --> 02:43:57,820
No big deal.

2080
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,600
Doors, I mean entrance delayers?

2081
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:05,100
Exactly.

2082
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:05,660
Luckily!

2083
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:13,740
Though guys, I think I will call it here for today.

2084
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:16,780
I'm starting to get hungry.

2085
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:18,580
So I think I'm gonna go eat.

2086
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,240
But I will be on Doki Bird's channel.

2087
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:25,620
Well, hopefully she finishes Metal Gear tonight.

2088
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:26,780
I think that's the plan.

2089
02:44:27,620 --> 02:44:29,380
That will be the attempt.

2090
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:43,980
Crocodile!

2091
02:44:48,090 --> 02:44:49,850
I sure don't look like one.

2092
02:44:54,850 --> 02:44:57,010
Wow, this place is crazy looking.

2093
02:44:58,530 --> 02:44:58,950
Whoa!

2094
02:45:01,630 --> 02:45:02,190
Whoa!

2095
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:04,790
It's my home.

2096
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:11,390
Spike, thank you so much for the time!

2097
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:13,330
Okay, thank you.

2098
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:15,450
Hold on, I'm gonna grab these real quick.

2099
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:18,330
I feel like...

2100
02:45:18,990 --> 02:45:23,110
for it being like an iron pickaxe, I don't know.

2101
02:45:23,130 --> 02:45:25,190
No, I feel like it breaks really easily.

2102
02:45:25,890 --> 02:45:26,590
I'm not a fan.

2103
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:29,550
I'm not a very big fan.

2104
02:45:31,390 --> 02:45:32,190
Are you dangerous?

2105
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:33,590
Sand lizard?

2106
02:45:34,530 --> 02:45:35,290
No, you're safe.

2107
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:39,350
We're now in the desert.

2108
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:42,950
I would, like I said, I would like to really...

2109
02:45:44,410 --> 02:45:46,150
We're hiding from the bug?

2110
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:51,310
I would really like to make a server with everybody, but...

2111
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:55,850
You know, we will see how that goes.

2112
02:45:58,810 --> 02:46:00,070
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

2113
02:46:02,590 --> 02:46:04,550
Thanks for the comfy block vibes.

2114
02:46:04,830 --> 02:46:05,370
Feel better soon.

2115
02:46:05,490 --> 02:46:06,190
Thank you.

2116
02:46:06,310 --> 02:46:08,250
Like I said, I should feel better tomorrow.

2117
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:09,230
Hopefully, I think.

2118
02:46:09,230 --> 02:46:09,950
I think so.

2119
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:14,930
If not, if I don't feel better tomorrow, I will.

2120
02:46:16,510 --> 02:46:20,730
I don't want to move Alan Wake, but...

2121
02:46:21,410 --> 02:46:21,850
Maybe.

2122
02:46:22,850 --> 02:46:25,570
Just so that I'm feeling okay for the Tenzetsu Kodam.

2123
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:30,490
I'm not doing double stream again tomorrow if I'm not
feeling good.

2124
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:32,890
But hopefully I'm feeling better in the morning tomorrow.

2125
02:46:33,490 --> 02:46:34,410
We shall see.

2126
02:46:35,250 --> 02:46:36,130
Alan move.

2127
02:46:38,330 --> 02:46:40,010
Targo, thank you so much for the peek.

2128
02:46:40,230 --> 02:46:41,330
See you later on Doki's stream.

2129
02:46:41,470 --> 02:46:42,170
See you later.

2130
02:46:42,370 --> 02:46:43,250
Yeah, I'm going to go eat.

2131
02:46:43,430 --> 02:46:44,670
I'm getting real hungry.

2132
02:46:45,150 --> 02:46:49,230
So thank you everybody for fun hightail adventures.
