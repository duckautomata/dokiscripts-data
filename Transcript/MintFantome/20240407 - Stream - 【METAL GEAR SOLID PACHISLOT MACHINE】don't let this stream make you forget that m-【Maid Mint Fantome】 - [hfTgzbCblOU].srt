1
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm Fred No-Ben.

2
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,200
Invisible Ben.

3
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,140
Freaky Ghost Ben!

4
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

5
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Welcome.

6
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,730
Do you see what is next to me?

7
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,790
Do you perceive... this?

8
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,430
It's quite quiet right now because it's in like this... I call it trailer mode.

9
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,690
I don't know if it has another... whatever.

10
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,970
It's my Apache slot!

11
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,770
Yippee!

12
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,050
Oh my gosh.

13
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,830
My stuff is kind of all over the place.

14
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,130
So attract mode.

15
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,290
Demo mode!

16
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,170
Sounds like the most sense.

17
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,270
But I kind of like attract mode.

18
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,090
Attract mode is... wait, that's real?

19
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,250
Attract mode is an actual phrase?

20
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,330
I've never heard that before.

21
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,850
It's just like...

22
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,430
Oh my gosh, thank you!

23
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,890
It's like a... how to say?

24
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,510
It's like a... she gives you a little like...

25
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,850
She splashes a little ankle like...

26
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,810
Mmm, don't you wanna try...

27
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,170
My...

28
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,690
Where's...

29
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,010
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

30
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,590
Ooh la la, baby!

31
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,270
Actually, this is really strange because...

32
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,830
Because I don't think before I ever did a hand cam.

33
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,090
Because, you know, for me it's a little difficult as a ghost.

34
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,590
But I got some special gloves.

35
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,710
Thank you!

36
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,450
I know almost nothing about the Apache slot other than the cutscenes and it playing at a convention once.

37
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,750
This is a whole new and unique experience.

38
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,310
I know!

39
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,350
I'm so excited!

40
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,710
Paid actor?

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,250
No, no.

42
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,670
I got some ghost gloves.

43
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,450
Because usually if you see...

44
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:33,470
Like if I'm trying to show you my hands on stream, you won't be able to see, you know?

45
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,310
Because I'm a ghost.

46
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,390
Like it's see-through.

47
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,690
But I got these like special ghost gloves that kind of hold my ectoplasm in.

48
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,850
So, we'll be a-okay, baby!

49
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,630
Yippee!

50
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,610
Also, I will need to test some audio stuff with you guys.

51
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,110
I want your opinions.

52
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,790
Because there are three...

53
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,970
Thank you for the donation, Zaku!

54
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,070
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

55
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,430
Pachinko.

56
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:12,070
There are three sound options that we can get for you guys hearing the machine itself.

57
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:12,910
Oh my god.

58
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,050
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous!

59
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,150
Thank you!

60
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,090
Thank you guys for the donation so much.

61
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

62
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,410
That machine looks so cool.

63
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,350
It's very cool.

64
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,030
Honestly!

65
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,250
If anything, it just looks amazing, right?

66
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,950
Like it's just so well...

67
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,410
And so, so well.

68
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,090
It's so well.

69
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,050
It's so pretty.

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,630
It's so good.

71
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,510
It's not good.

72
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,590
It's just...

73
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,150
Even without playing it, this thing's rad.

74
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,270
I know, right?

75
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,690
Like the details on it are kind of insane.

76
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,850
Also, it's really cool because...

77
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,330
Let me show you.

78
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,190
Like this...

79
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,010
Hold on.

80
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,410
I'm waiting for it to light back up.

81
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,470
I'm sorry about the lighting.

82
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,670
Um...

83
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,010
I...

84
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,170
It will get better.

85
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,170
I wanted to make sure you could see.

86
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,570
Uh...

87
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,410
The...

88
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,770
Of course, the...

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,350
Um...

90
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,870
The slots themselves.

91
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,250
Uh...

92
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,210
It was a little tricky.

93
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,150
I had to go through a couple different cameras.

94
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,370
Um...

95
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,870
I tried to see if there was a way to output the screen itself.

96
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,430
But also, then you wouldn't be able to see the slots.

97
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,250
So, we kind of had to have it in camera mode like this.

98
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,690
I currently...

99
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,490
I got my...

100
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,910
I got my...

101
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,430
Um...

102
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,410
Stop talking about my hand!

103
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,330
I...

104
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,930
I...

105
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,110
Um...

106
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,430
What was I saying?

107
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:38,930
Oh my gosh.

108
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,210
You guys made me forget.

109
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,830
Um...

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,510
Um...

111
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,270
Um...

112
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,650
Uh...

113
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,250
Uh...

114
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,070
What was I saying?

115
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,090
Oh!

116
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,690
I...

117
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,690
I got my GoPro.

118
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,770
Actually, to work as like a webcam.

119
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,530
And it has the best kind of...

120
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:52,870
Oh my gosh.

121
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,310
Ah!

122
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,150
It's so good.

123
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,810
Oh my gosh.

124
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,790
I screamed.

125
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,950
Don't scream!

126
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,330
Boo!

127
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,270
Boo!

128
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,730
Thank you!

129
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,310
Almost too spooky to handle.

130
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,990
Real...

131
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,470
Real ghost activity.

132
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,790
This is actually...

133
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,650
I tricked you guys.

134
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,870
This is a real phasmophobia stream.

135
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,030
Oh my gosh.

136
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,450
Um...

137
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,310
But yeah.

138
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,050
So, sorry that it is like a camera like this.

139
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,110
I wish that I could output...

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,150
Maybe in the future I can find a way to do it.

141
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,310
If I become so technically illiterate.

142
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:35,930
Um...

143
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,430
But...

144
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,630
Again...

145
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,450
Of course, we're wanting to see the slots themselves too.

146
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,550
Also...

147
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,130
Um...

148
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,530
Just...

149
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,450
I don't know if I can...

150
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,570
If there's anything like legally...

151
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,870
Yeah.

152
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,090
Like...

153
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,030
You know...

154
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,070
Obviously, this is a gambling machine.

155
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,350
But...

156
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,850
I will not be paying any money as I have this nifty button right here.

157
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,290
Yeah.

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,790
That...

159
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,790
Oh!

160
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,830
Oh gosh.

161
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,290
It started.

162
00:07:59,450 --> 00:07:59,890
Uh...

163
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,390
That if I press it...

164
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,710
It inputs...

165
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,150
It inputs credits for me.

166
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,350
So...

167
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,310
I'm also sorry.

168
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,490
There is a slight flicker.

169
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,430
I know I'm apologizing like so much.

170
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,910
But...

171
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,550
You know...

172
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,930
I...

173
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:13,770
I really...

174
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,870
I did my best to like put up...

175
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,270
Put the optimal set up for your enjoyment.

176
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,270
Also, look at this!

177
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,650
Bla-la-la-la-la...

178
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,650
Bla-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

179
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,630
This is one big screen.

180
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,330
Isn't that crazy?

181
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,370
It's one huge screen.

182
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,450
It's so awesome.

183
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,450
Yeah!

184
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,610
Um...

185
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,870
I will be picking up the camera and kind of like zooming in.

186
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,390
Oh!

187
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,310
You can see him!

188
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,670
Oh!

189
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,390
You can see him!

190
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,970
Just a little bit!

191
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,290
This is what it looks like.

192
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,170
My perspective is a little cropped Also, for people who are just like, this is pachinko.

193
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,650
No, this is patchy slot.

194
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,690
Because it's not pachinko, it won't be like...

195
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,610
You know what I mean?

196
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,710
It won't be all the little balls falling and being noisy and annoying.

197
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,510
No, it's actually quite quiet, which is...

198
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,470
I mean, you probably can barely hear it right now.

199
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,130
Which brings me to my next thing.

200
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,630
Thank you!

201
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,130
I can't believe we kidnapped a cute girl to represent you, Mint.

202
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,810
No, I swear!

203
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,150
This is a ghostly hand.

204
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,410
Just with ectoplasm gloves on.

205
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,550
Or ectoplasm...

206
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,270
What's the word?

207
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,810
And hands.

208
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,490
Kabuki-cho pachinko ASMR.

209
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,670
No, thank you.

210
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,610
Okay, so...

211
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,210
We have three options.

212
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,010
For your listening pleasure.

213
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,550
One!

214
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,990
Is just like how it is now.

215
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,050
Right now, there's like no music.

216
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,330
I will... let's see.

217
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,510
Let's add some cash money up in here.

218
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,850
You can probably barely hear it.

219
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,690
Barely, barely, barely hear it.

220
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,110
I'm just gonna put in a ton.

221
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,650
Yeah, simp!

222
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,610
Okay, we maxed that out.

223
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,910
So, I'll also give you kind of a rundown of a little bit of the stuff.

224
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,610
One thing you can't see is right here.

225
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,070
My hand, hello.

226
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,450
On the side here.

227
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,750
This is kind of hard to see because I have my lights out.

228
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,710
So you can see the screen better.

229
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,350
But this is like a walkie-talkie kind of thing.

230
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,470
And then on the side, there's like a light up exclamation point.

231
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,210
It's so cute.

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,010
Anyway, okay.

233
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,090
Yeah, you can hear it.

234
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,550
Okay, so this is a little button to control a menu.

235
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,470
The menu kind of changes...

236
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,590
How to say?

237
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,830
The...

238
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,910
It changes...

239
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,750
It changes one.

240
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,630
You can change...

241
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:22,410
There's some points where they'll like say like, push button one, push button two, push button three.

242
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,670
And someone will be like, middle, right, left.

243
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,510
And you can change the voice.

244
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,770
You can change it to like Snake or The Boss or Siggint.

245
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,230
Oh my gosh.

246
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,290
Thank you for the Akadono.

247
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,490
Arigato.

248
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,250
Arigato-chu.

249
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,930
Thank you.

250
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,870
You're the reason why I'm getting into Metal Gear now.

251
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,770
So I'm really excited.

252
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,830
Thank you so much.

253
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,390
Thank you.

254
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,070
But there's also...

255
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,370
You can change the mode.

256
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,710
So there's like advanced mode, normal mode, and classic mode.

257
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,790
I honestly...

258
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,210
I have no idea the difference.

259
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,710
They are all difficult.

260
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,510
I have no idea.

261
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,610
I have no idea.

262
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,410
Of course, we have our little lever here.

263
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,250
We have the payout button right here.

264
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,090
And of course, our...

265
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,230
Our clicky-clacky buttons.

266
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,090
So let's try.

267
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,230
All right.

268
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,430
Oh my god.

269
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,230
Wow.

270
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,210
Great start.

271
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,950
Oh my gosh.

272
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,810
Doesn't it just look so good though?

273
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,170
Oh my god.

274
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,690
Snake looks so awesome.

275
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,730
Okay.

276
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,990
I'm going to keep going until something...

277
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,650
Oh.

278
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,370
Okay.

279
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,650
We got spotted kind of.

280
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,070
So this is...

281
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,850
This is a good point to test the audio, I'd say.

282
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,110
Because you can hear.

283
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,750
Also, I can't let this run for too long.

284
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,390
But I'll let it run for too long just right now because something kind of cool happens.

285
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,350
If you let the slots keep going, keep going.

286
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,330
But this is a good point to test the audio.

287
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:54,850
So.

288
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,170
So.

289
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,870
This is the first audio.

290
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,910
It's really mostly...

291
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,930
It's just my regular mic.

292
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:06,250
But I do have another mic set up over here.

293
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,050
So you can hear.

294
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,710
You can hear the game a little bit better.

295
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:16,670
But if I play my mic and this mic at the same time, obviously there's going to be an echo in my voice.

296
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,410
We can't hear the audio.

297
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,790
I know.

298
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,310
I know.

299
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,710
It's not on right now.

300
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,670
Thank you.

301
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,250
But if I have only this mic on, it kind of sounds like an Xbox mic.

302
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,130
So I'm going to turn on this mic now.

303
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,230
So you can hear.

304
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,130
How is that?

305
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,030
It's pretty good.

306
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,530
Probably you can hear my voice twice.

307
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,670
But if it doesn't bother you guys, we can keep it.

308
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,170
Because obviously I want you guys to hear my voice.

309
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,810
It's loud.

310
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm so sorry.

311
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm so sorry.

312
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
It's kind of spooky.

313
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,060
And then if I turn off my mic and I only have...

314
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,340
It's still loud?

315
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,060
It's still loud?

316
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,500
Sorry.

317
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:11,920
Sorry.

318
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:21,800
If I only have this mic on, I sound like I'm playing Xbox Call of Duty.

319
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,120
So which one would you guys prefer?

320
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,540
I'm going to put up a poll, actually.

321
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,420
That'll help me the most, I think.

322
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,620
So, poll.

323
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,100
Which mic?

324
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,240
Which?

325
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,460
Mint only?

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
Mint and Pachinko?

327
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,670
Xbox mic.

328
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,170
The way I actually...

329
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,590
It's kind of funny.

330
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,890
It's kind of funny how...

331
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,730
This is actually the webcam mic.

332
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,390
I intended on having like...

333
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,050
See?

334
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,630
See?

335
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,090
Ah!

336
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,550
Ah!

337
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:05,850
Ah!

338
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,830
Ah!

339
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,510
The sorrow comes and he's just like...

340
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,050
He says, stop the reel.

341
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,030
Stop us from spinning.

342
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,750
It's so spooky.

343
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,810
I love it.

344
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,570
But...

345
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,890
This is actually a webcam.

346
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,470
I intended on having like a webcam kind of like giving a more close up image.

347
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,930
But in the end, my webcam was kind of shit.

348
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,430
So it just didn't do a good quality.

349
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,170
So I'm really sorry.

350
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,390
But this is the best I could do.

351
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,150
And what I had.

352
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,710
Yeah.

353
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,470
That was cool.

354
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:40,810
Right?

355
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,610
It's so cool.

356
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:42,790
Okay.

357
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,530
So we managed to escape.

358
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,790
Now, you are going to see all of this a lot.

359
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,790
This cut...

360
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,790
These cut scenes you are going to see so many times.

361
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,930
And I bet you are...

362
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,250
I bet you were going to see a bunny.

363
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,550
Oh, never mind.

364
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,170
Oh, the tree was in the way.

365
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,790
Wow.

366
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,110
I was wrong.

367
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,850
I saw a bunny so many times.

368
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,390
Okay.

369
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,070
We're walking down.

370
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,690
This is what I mean that not a lot happens in this game.

371
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,270
Also, I see...

372
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,390
I see that the result is mint and pachinko.

373
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,670
Double.

374
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,150
Okay.

375
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,270
So we're going to keep it like this.

376
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,230
I'm so sorry if it's distracting for some of you guys.

377
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,610
But...

378
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,230
Yeah.

379
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,890
We're going to keep it like this.

380
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,530
Dang.

381
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,170
Lost the shot.

382
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:21,310
Yeah.

383
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,170
The tree was in the way is what he said.

384
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,610
Yeah.

385
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,930
The tree was in the way.

386
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,130
So we're going to bet.

387
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,330
We're going to do this.

388
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,970
We're walking down the pathway.

389
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,510
A whole lot of nothing is going on.

390
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,030
Oh, gosh.

391
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,210
Oh, my gosh.

392
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,830
What is it?

393
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,250
What could it be?

394
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,610
What could it be?

395
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,210
What could it be?

396
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,610
What could it be?

397
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,770
It's going to be...

398
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,330
I don't know.

399
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,810
A chance.

400
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,350
Yeah.

401
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,350
It's a chance.

402
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:47,990
Oh, my gosh.

403
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,070
He gave me a chance.

404
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,470
You guys.

405
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,670
Oh.

406
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,490
We upgraded to blue.

407
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,370
I have no idea what that means.

408
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,990
Our loot box in Metal Gear.

409
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,610
Can you imagine?

410
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,710
It may be this.

411
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,030
Oh.

412
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,890
Pasha.

413
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,670
Oh, dang.

414
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,570
Of course, the one time...

415
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,110
Look at that.

416
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,230
It's going to be...

417
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,210
Isn't it so cool?

418
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,970
Gosh.

419
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,470
It's...

420
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,170
Oh.

421
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,670
Okay.

422
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,070
Place your bets, everyone.

423
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,230
What do you think we're going to get?

424
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,870
I think we're going to get a fork.

425
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,010
What do you think you're going to get?

426
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,610
What do you think?

427
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,450
The screen broke.

428
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:22,850
I know.

429
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,690
It's so cool, right?

430
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,470
A cigar?

431
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,110
A ration?

432
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,050
I think we're going to get a fork.

433
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,490
But if we get a ration, that would be pretty awesome.

434
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,290
I'll...

435
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:31,610
Okay.

436
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,270
Out of all the times I've played this, I've only...

437
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,170
I'll give you guys a clue.

438
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,210
I've only gotten a fork and a ration.

439
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,730
I've never gotten a ration before.

440
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,010
I have never gotten a cigar or an ammunition box or a key or the mystery ever.

441
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,210
So, streamer luck.

442
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,110
Come on.

443
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,150
Streamer luck.

444
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,190
Come on.

445
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,950
Streamer luck.

446
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,850
We got a fork.

447
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:52,790
That's okay.

448
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,450
Next time.

449
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,530
Sokolove.

450
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,430
He's going to say...

451
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,850
What?

452
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,370
Oh, my God.

453
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,710
I'm breaking all expectations today.

454
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,210
Oh, my God.

455
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,450
It's a fork.

456
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,990
Let's go, baby.

457
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,370
Oh.

458
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,690
We upgraded to gold.

459
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,130
I have no idea what that means.

460
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,150
Oh.

461
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,150
Oh, my God.

462
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,930
Are we going to...

463
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,450
Oh, wait.

464
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,250
Now we will see the bunny.

465
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,090
I think.

466
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,550
What?

467
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,550
Oh, my God.

468
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,110
What is going on?

469
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:30,970
No way.

470
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,870
Oh, my God.

471
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,450
Oh, oh.

472
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,770
Oh.

473
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,050
Oh.

474
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,110
Oh.

475
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,190
Oh.

476
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,590
Oh, my God.

477
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,250
Did you see that glitch?

478
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,830
Thank you for the doughnut!

479
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,850
Based on lore, would this ghastly form be akin to venish...

480
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,570
Venish?

481
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,370
Ven...

482
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,350
Ven...

483
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,810
Oh, the ven...

484
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,250
Venum punish steak or big boss.

485
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,530
So, I'm absolutely jealous you got your hands on such a legendary trophy.

486
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,130
I know some people...

487
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,210
Good.

488
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,050
What does that mean?

489
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,710
What does that mean?

490
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,650
I know some people have wondered how much this cost me.

491
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,630
We can continue!

492
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,450
Oh my gosh, you guys, we can continue to the next area.

493
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,310
Now, these parts are so cute because like... okay, you'll see.

494
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,270
Here we go.

495
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,250
The progress!

496
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,330
Camouflage is a mystery.

497
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,590
Oh my gosh.

498
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,630
Mic peaking?

499
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,290
Oh, I'm so sorry.

500
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,630
Okay, I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.

501
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,450
I'm so sorry.

502
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,430
This is still experimental.

503
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,090
I was trying.

504
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,370
Okay.

505
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:48,810
Oh!

506
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,910
Wait, so we're trying to get Sokolov.

507
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,710
This is the Sokolov.

508
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,970
Okay, next.

509
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,070
Good, good.

510
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,490
The music is so cute.

511
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,990
And... continue!

512
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:02,930
Next!

513
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,090
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

514
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,930
Okay, okay.

515
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,110
Wait.

516
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,610
Why are we...

517
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,550
Why are we suddenly inside the building?

518
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,550
Okay.

519
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,030
Last game!

520
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,730
Oh my gosh.

521
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:13,890
What?

522
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,330
It's on fire!

523
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,770
I'll be honest.

524
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,610
I've never seen this.

525
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,890
Get him!

526
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,610
Get him, Aslan!

527
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,510
We're getting back to our mission!

528
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:22,930
Yeah!

529
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,710
Oh my gosh.

530
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,570
No way!

531
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,430
First try!

532
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,210
We're getting back to our mission already?

533
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,570
Oh my god.

534
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,130
Oh my god.

535
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,570
Oh my god.

536
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:29,890
Oh my god.

537
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,410
Oh my god.

538
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,290
Oh my god.

539
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,490
Maybe.

540
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,830
Sokolov won't refuse to stay with you.

541
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,370
Okay.

542
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,510
Let's go save Sokolov.

543
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:38,610
Okay.

544
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:38,610
Let's go save Sokolov.

545
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,050
I guess.

546
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,410
Sokolov, real!

547
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,410
Okay.

548
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,170
I don't think you can choose a guy.

549
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,170
I think it just kind of...

550
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,190
I don't think you can choose a guy.

551
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,190
I think it just kind of...

552
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,070
We're just gonna attack him.

553
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,390
We're just gonna attack him.

554
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:49,750
Alright.

555
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,020
Okay.

556
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,760
Come on, Snake.

557
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,800
Take his butt down!

558
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,440
Take his butt down!

559
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,660
Great!

560
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,620
So cute!

561
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,200
I love Tiny Paramedic.

562
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,100
She's so precious.

563
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
I love Tiny Paramedic.

564
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,080
She's so precious.

565
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,320
Okay.

566
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Okay.

567
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,860
So...

568
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,420
If we do all of this well, if we complete this Virtuous Mission well, we'll get the actual, like, cutscenes of the game.

569
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,220
Which is what I really want to show you guys.

570
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,280
Thank you for the dada!

571
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,000
Thank you!

572
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,560
Thank you for the dada!

573
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Thank you!

574
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,540
Okay.

575
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,600
Took that guy down.

576
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,260
Easy peasy.

577
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,520
Great!

578
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,580
Come on!

579
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,260
Oh my god!

580
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,080
He's got the knife!

581
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,180
He's got the knife!

582
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,040
Okay.

583
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,200
Hold on.

584
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,660
Let's try again.

585
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,200
Let's try again.

586
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,340
The timing...

587
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,980
was not right.

588
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,200
Yes!

589
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Okay.

590
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,870
Mic desynced.

591
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,670
Oh, I'm so sorry.

592
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,330
I'm doing my best, you guys.

593
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:56,690
Okay.

594
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,090
Here we go.

595
00:21:59,390 --> 00:21:59,910
Okay.

596
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,130
Take

597
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,910
his butt down!

598
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,140
Getting better at gambling.

599
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:22,860
Good.

600
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,420
Okay.

601
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,620
We at least made it.

602
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,400
Yosh!

603
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,400
There is a button here?

604
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm not quite sure what it's for.

605
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,280
It does say push, but I don't know ever when to push it.

606
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh no!

607
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh no!

608
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,180
So loud!

609
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,200
Chuuu!

610
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,880
Thank you!

611
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
Even Mint is surprised by the patchy slot going off script.

612
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,480
There's a lot.

613
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
Oh, I have to add more friends.

614
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,880
We've already spent...

615
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
It goes up to 50 credits.

616
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
And we've already spent them.

617
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,820
Isn't that crazy?

618
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,780
I don't know actually how much...

619
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,980
I don't know actually how much it cost to play this.

620
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,600
If anyone has any better insight.

621
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,640
I always fail this, you guys.

622
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,380
I always fail this.

623
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
$20 per credit.

624
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,960
$20 per credit.

625
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,440
Does the pachinko machine come with some sort of developer mode that lets you automatically get alternate scenes?

626
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,780
If it does, I don't...

627
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,160
I don't know.

628
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,720
You guys, my luck is coming in real clutch here.

629
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,800
Look how cute he looks!

630
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,760
Okay...

631
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,600
Come on, Snake!

632
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,400
Don't miss!

633
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,120
Oh!

634
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,960
I told you guys.

635
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm sorry.

636
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,120
I think...

637
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,120
Now we have to go back to the very beginning.

638
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,640
No?

639
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,700
Okay, yup.

640
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,900
We're back at the very beginning.

641
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Your eyes jump!

642
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,040
Thank you!

643
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,180
There is...

644
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,220
So basically...

645
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,420
When I...

646
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,900
When I was setting up yesterday for this...

647
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,240
I did have to like...

648
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,540
I did have to kind of do some stuff because when I hadn't turned it off in the two months that I was gone...

649
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,540
Um...

650
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,380
Like there's like a thing with the RAM.

651
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,840
I had to like clear the RAM.

652
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,160
Um...

653
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:45,240
And like there's like a system key and then I press the reset button and turn the system key off and it was like this whole thing.

654
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,680
Oh, oh sorry.

655
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
I still have money!

656
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,860
I still have money!

657
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,240
Oh, it sucks that we went back to the beginning.

658
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,960
Um...

659
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,440
I want to hopefully...

660
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
There's two things I want to show.

661
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,900
First is a boss fight.

662
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,540
Whichever boss we can get.

663
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,360
And second is the um...

664
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,080
If we can get big boss mode.

665
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,800
Um...

666
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Actually, I do want to show...

667
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,820
There we go.

668
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,020
I do want to show the menu too if I have a chance.

669
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,740
Oh!

670
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,300
Oh!

671
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,920
Oh!

672
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,660
Oh!

673
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,480
No, no, no.

674
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,480
We'll take this guy down.

675
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,660
Ooh!

676
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:31,900
Ooh!

677
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,100
Nice!

678
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,720
Your soup.

679
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,540
The sheer amount of effort you went through to stream this is so funny.

680
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,940
What do you mean?

681
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,160
I paid for Streamlabs Pro to make you look at my Oshis.

682
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Stop!

683
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,120
Wait, I missed it!

684
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,540
I'm sorry!

685
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,400
Snake!

686
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,840
Bajamin!

687
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,760
Oh, here we go.

688
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,820
So this is the menu that I was talking about earlier.

689
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,880
Um...

690
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,620
So this is like the kind of mode.

691
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,160
There's classic, normal, advanced.

692
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,720
We're just on normal.

693
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,560
Yeah...

694
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:14,940
Oh!

695
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,440
No!

696
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,020
Oh!

697
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,520
Okay.

698
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,620
Just kidding.

699
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,140
I can't show you the other things now.

700
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,320
I can't show you the other...

701
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,440
Oh!

702
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:25,780
Oh!

703
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,160
Here we go.

704
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,100
Okay.

705
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,900
This is the um...

706
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,220
Sinabi Custom.

707
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,060
The Navigator.

708
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,900
You can have Major Zero.

709
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,820
You can have...

710
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:36,940
Oh!

711
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,660
I thought there was Sigand.

712
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,400
But I think I remembered Sigand just because he's here.

713
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,300
You can't actually have him talking for you.

714
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,940
Obviously Snake, Ocelot, and the boss.

715
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,240
I think I had it set to the boss.

716
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,320
But who do you guys want?

717
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,260
I don't think we've heard...

718
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,100
We haven't heard them doing the...

719
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,060
Yeah.

720
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,980
But which one do you guys want?

721
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:03,880
Ocelot?

722
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,180
I saw Ocelot the most, I think.

723
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,280
You sound so goofy.

724
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,300
You sound so goofy.

725
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,520
This is...

726
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,600
The game just looks so beautiful.

727
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,880
Also, little Snake down here will sometimes be dressed up different.

728
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Sometimes he'll have his shirt off.

729
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,120
Sometimes...

730
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,720
Sometimes he'll be wearing a beret.

731
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,980
And the tree was in the background.

732
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,200
We're Snow!

733
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,340
I don't know what this is.

734
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,160
I have no idea.

735
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,480
I don't know at all.

736
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,060
I think it helps when you go into like the Virtuous Mission and stuff.

737
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
Hi, Paramedic!

738
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,940
Oh my gosh!

739
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Oh!

740
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh!

741
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,060
Oh!

742
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
The lighting!

743
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,080
Oh, that was kind of crazy!

744
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,320
Um...

745
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
This is... This is...

746
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,660
I think for...

747
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,280
Here, I'm gonna make a pin real quick about, uh...

748
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,080
Hold on.

749
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,760
About my mic situation.

750
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,800
There is double mic.

751
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,740
So...

752
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,080
Um...

753
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:25,440
You can hear the game better without me sounding like I'm on an Xbox.

754
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,180
Is it peaking so much though?

755
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,220
Um...

756
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah, I mentioned that we voted for it.

757
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,140
I will...

758
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,220
I voted it was the best option.

759
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,180
Sorry!

760
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,060
If it's weird.

761
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,640
LMAO!

762
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,680
It's not peaking that much.

763
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,880
Okay.

764
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,160
Pin message.

765
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
Just close echo.

766
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,240
Okay.

767
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,760
Yeah, I'm so sorry about it.

768
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,880
I... I was... That's... I was very like... I was very much like, I don't know which option to choose.

769
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,480
Like...

770
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,020
I want you guys to be able to hear me better, but also hear the game so clearly as well too.

771
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,340
Okay.

772
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,300
These guys are...

773
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,200
do something.

774
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,260
Sorry!

775
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,320
Sorry, Soru!

776
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm... I'm gonna stop it!

777
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,240
Hold on!

778
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,660
Oh.

779
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,940
They're so stupid.

780
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,180
We're just crouched behind a tree.

781
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
These guys are idiots.

782
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,480
Oh!

783
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,380
It's glitching again.

784
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,260
Okay.

785
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,820
Interesting.

786
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,300
Interesting.

787
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,260
Oh.

788
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,220
Um...

789
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:26,980
Uros.

790
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,020
Oh!

791
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
Tiger tribe.

792
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,660
Okay.

793
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,360
Nice.

794
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,680
I wonder when we'll see the body.

795
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,580
...

796
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,760
...

797
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,240
...

798
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,180
I have been given the gift of prophecy.

799
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,660
...

800
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,340
...

801
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,860
...

802
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,140
Um...

803
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,880
Oh!

804
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,060
I was gonna say earlier.

805
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,920
I keep forgetting.

806
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,700
Um...

807
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,640
Wait.

808
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,400
Former slot mathematician here.

809
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,880
You should get more cutscenes if you bet max credits and max...

810
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,860
I don't know.

811
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,100
Oh, I do max bet every time.

812
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,880
And I... I'll just add all the credits.

813
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,560
Oh.

814
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,440
We're gonna shoot this guy.

815
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,940
We're gonna shoot this guy this time.

816
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,420
Or...

817
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,980
We're gonna throw...

818
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,040
Um... something to distract him.

819
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh!

820
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,540
Oh!

821
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh!

822
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,280
We shot him!

823
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Oh my gosh!

824
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,240
Nice!

825
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,100
Streamer Luke.

826
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,700
Pew!

827
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,300
Oh.

828
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,700
Pew!

829
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Oh.

830
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,760
Why does it every time that I try to make the noise it doesn't work?

831
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,840
Um...

832
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,960
Oh!

833
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,300
Oh!

834
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,060
This is the one where he beats up the barrel!

835
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,280
...

836
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,840
...

837
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,220
...

838
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,880
Chance!

839
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,560
We got to see Vulcan!

840
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,800
Vulcan looks so good in this game.

841
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,220
It's crazy.

842
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,620
Um...

843
00:30:59,620 --> 00:30:59,940
Sorry.

844
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,560
I keep getting distracted with what I want to say.

845
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:03,980
Um...

846
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,240
People might be wondering how much this cost me.

847
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,800
Usually...

848
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,540
I know we're at yellow.

849
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,800
Usually...

850
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,720
I don't like to... you know...

851
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,600
I'm not trying to... I don't want to like...

852
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,380
brag.

853
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,180
I'm not trying to brag or anything!

854
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,620
Do we get to see Rykov?

855
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,840
Rykov is here, yes.

856
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,240
We do get to see him sometimes.

857
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,480
Um...

858
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,920
But...

859
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,500
It was about...

860
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,600
With shipping...

861
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,560
It was about...

862
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,400
Um...

863
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,380
I can't remember exactly.

864
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I think it was about like...

865
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,580
1400 US dollars.

866
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,700
So some people think like it's a correct...

867
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,820
I mean that is a lot of money.

868
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,440
Don't get me wrong.

869
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,560
But like it is not maybe what some people think.

870
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,160
And...

871
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,540
To be fair, like this thing...

872
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
I mean it's very nice.

873
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,500
So...

874
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,760
Um...

875
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh!

876
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,720
Oh!

877
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,880
Oh!

878
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,920
Oh!

879
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,700
Oh!

880
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,020
Oh!

881
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,380
Okay we get to progress you guys!

882
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,660
I don't know why!

883
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,640
I don't know why we're progressing but something happened!

884
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,320
The progress.

885
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,440
Camouflage is still a mystery.

886
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,220
That's okay.

887
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,040
Also I love down here like the...

888
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,240
It's like the title screen.

889
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,060
It just looks so cool.

890
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,280
Okay we're in a different place this time.

891
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,540
Cheaper than my PC.

892
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,240
Yeah!

893
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,720
Like it is like...

894
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,080
You know...

895
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,480
Less expensive than some gaming PCs so...

896
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,260
Okay?

897
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,960
Doing so well?

898
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,780
Sorry.

899
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,100
I get so used to just like...

900
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,680
So I gotta build up a little suspense really.

901
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,040
Okay.

902
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,720
Okay.

903
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,600
Okay.

904
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,040
Okay.

905
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,440
What?

906
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,020
I didn't even finish!

907
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,340
No way!

908
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,300
I didn't even get...

909
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
I didn't even...

910
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,580
The game is rigged!

911
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,420
Uh oh.

912
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,980
Are we in warning or...

913
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,260
You can get caught by the way.

914
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,420
And then there's like a...

915
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,300
Up here there will be like the...

916
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,560
Countdown and everything.

917
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,260
Pasha!

918
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,760
Every time!

919
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,540
Back to blue.

920
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,300
Back to blue.

921
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,120
See I told you guys we would be seeing this cutscene a whole lot.

922
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh!

923
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,900
Oh!

924
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,300
Oh!

925
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,060
Oh my gosh!

926
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,700
Is there something inside?

927
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,600
Please don't get crushed!

928
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,420
Please!

929
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,240
Oh my god!

930
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,840
It's my destiny!

931
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,640
We in the boss!

932
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,540
Oh come on.

933
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
I don't know.

934
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,800
Pasha!

935
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,480
Oh!

936
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,500
Shit!

937
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,960
Uh oh.

938
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,480
We stepped on a stick.

939
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,580
Oh we are so suspicious.

940
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,400
Who is it?

941
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,480
Oh my gosh.

942
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,440
It's okay.

943
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,380
Everybody...

944
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,100
Calm down.

945
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,440
Woohoo!

946
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,300
I like how we are like non-lethal mode the whole time.

947
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,460
Never thought I would watch slots.

948
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,480
I like how he calls them annoying guys.

949
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,240
It's just like...

950
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,800
He's burning the papers.

951
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,420
Oh my gosh.

952
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,980
What is this?

953
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,540
We are green now.

954
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,020
We are green.

955
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,220
I don't know what that means.

956
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,780
They are annoying.

957
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,160
Yeah.

958
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,000
They are extremely annoying.

959
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:54,980
Segen!

960
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,900
We are red now!

961
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,540
I don't know what that means.

962
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,580
Oh!

963
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,220
Oh come on.

964
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,520
Come on.

965
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:05,720
Come on.

966
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,420
Come on.

967
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,340
Come on.

968
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,000
Come on!

969
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,600
Loot boxes...

970
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,740
hate me.

971
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,280
Oh.

972
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,880
Sokolov is still burning those papers.

973
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,620
What is this?

974
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,920
What is this?

975
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,660
If none of this makes sense to you guys, it doesn't make sense to me either.

976
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,220
I have no idea how this works.

977
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,280
I have tried looking up like...

978
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,700
if you get this combination, if you get this combination, but like...

979
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,520
I don't know.

980
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,560
Triple blue seems common.

981
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,080
Yeah.

982
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,960
What is this?

983
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
Who is this?

984
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,560
Hmm?

985
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,640
What is this?

986
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,260
Paramedic.

987
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
She is looking at her body again.

988
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,700
You know?

989
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,620
They don't make walkthroughs for slot machines.

990
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,420
This is the...

991
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:08,180
This is the walkthrough for anyone else who owns a Metal Gear Solid patchy slot machine.

992
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,780
We are seeing these guys quite often now.

993
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,520
Haha.

994
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,780
Just keep putting in credits.

995
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,160
Okay.

996
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,600
Okay.

997
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,040
What do you guys think we are going to get this time?

998
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,680
Two!

999
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,000
Thank you!

1000
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,400
Gotta feed the patchy slot.

1001
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,200
Wait.

1002
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,820
Okay.

1003
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
What should you guys think we are going to get?

1004
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
Fork?

1005
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,940
Key?

1006
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,540
Key?

1007
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,480
Key!

1008
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,980
Oh!

1009
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,780
We got a ration!

1010
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,240
Good to you guys.

1011
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,080
Oh!

1012
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,840
Another chance at the loot box.

1013
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,620
Please.

1014
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,280
I hate this.

1015
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,760
Just a box.

1016
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,960
It's literally just a box.

1017
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,100
Is the tree in the way?

1018
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,680
Oh!

1019
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,000
Ten!

1020
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,180
Alright guys.

1021
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,920
Come on.

1022
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,680
Thirty percent camouflage.

1023
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,440
Oof.

1024
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,360
That's okay though.

1025
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,940
That's okay.

1026
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,160
Come on.

1027
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,300
I just want to show you guys the box battle and how unfair it is.

1028
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,680
It is so unfair.

1029
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,520
It's absolutely...

1030
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,080
Ah!

1031
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,020
Oh my god.

1032
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,600
He got on his knees for us.

1033
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,660
Bring him to his knees.

1034
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280
Snake.

1035
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,840
What does Haten mean?

1036
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,960
Haten means progress.

1037
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,820
We can continue forward.

1038
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,880
Development.

1039
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:46,540
Development.

1040
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,800
I truly don't understand.

1041
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,100
Why?

1042
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,200
Okay.

1043
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,260
Oh!

1044
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,880
Okay.

1045
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,580
Yeah!

1046
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,540
Virtuous Vision!

1047
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,960
Okay.

1048
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,540
Cool.

1049
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:01,800
Cool.

1050
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:01,960
Cool.

1051
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,120
Cool.

1052
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,520
I really want us to get to the actual...

1053
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,040
Because when you get to the real Virtuous Mission, you can...

1054
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,340
You can see him doing the...

1055
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,160
He doesn't do the flips in this.

1056
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Which is actually a sin.

1057
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,200
But!

1058
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,140
How far have you gotten?

1059
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,680
It's hard to say.

1060
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,380
Because sometimes when I do this, I'll...

1061
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,660
I'll get to...

1062
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,000
I'll get to a boss fight and it will be Ocelot.

1063
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,340
And sometimes I'll get to a boss fight and it will be...

1064
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,980
The Fear or something.

1065
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,500
I've never seen the Fury and I've never seen the End.

1066
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,400
So if we get to either of them...

1067
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,980
Lucky day!

1068
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,020
You would think that...

1069
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,040
I love this 7.

1070
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,080
It's so awesome looking.

1071
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,080
You can kind of see it a little bit better.

1072
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,420
It's got like big boss art.

1073
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,340
It's really cool.

1074
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,480
Here's... ooh.

1075
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,760
Yes.

1076
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,900
Virtuous mission.

1077
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh wow!

1078
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,320
There's playing cutscenes in the back!

1079
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,660
I just realized.

1080
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,180
Oh my gosh!

1081
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,960
I never noticed that!

1082
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,360
Are those cutscenes from...

1083
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,760
Those don't look like...

1084
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,220
They're remade.

1085
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,740
Those look like...

1086
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:20,840
Yeah!

1087
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,080
That's from the actual game!

1088
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,540
What!

1089
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,260
That's cool!

1090
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,040
Okay.

1091
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,600
Sorry.

1092
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,680
Hold on.

1093
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,180
Oh.

1094
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,340
The colors are so pretty.

1095
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,100
Okay.

1096
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,100
Okay.

1097
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,760
We're good.

1098
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,400
I think.

1099
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,480
We're good.

1100
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:47,940
Okay.

1101
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,960
I have money!

1102
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,020
Don't kick me out!

1103
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,120
Good!

1104
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,340
Oh!

1105
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,460
Can you hear us a lot?

1106
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,920
I don't know if it makes a difference.

1107
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,940
You can do it out of order too.

1108
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,700
But I don't know if it makes a difference to make it like a better chance if you do it in order.

1109
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,500
Good!

1110
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Okay.

1111
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,760
It's not great, but we're getting good.

1112
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,800
Not gonna lie, having my arm out like...

1113
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:36,730
having my arms out floaty, but like having my arm like this is kind of a workout.

1114
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,670
Okay.

1115
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,170
All right.

1116
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,590
Come on.

1117
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,730
Take him out.

1118
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,030
Nevermind.

1119
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,870
Take him out with a great Tony the Tiger!

1120
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:48,970
He's...

1121
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,390
Ah!

1122
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,880
All right.

1123
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,540
This is... Okay.

1124
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,560
Chance two!

1125
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,280
Chance two!

1126
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,400
All right.

1127
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,020
Let's try and get stealth maybe.

1128
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,100
Oh!

1129
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,240
Three in a row.

1130
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,400
Okay.

1131
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,720
Come on.

1132
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,740
Tony the Tiger buff.

1133
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,060
No!

1134
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,720
No!

1135
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,880
We're back at the beginning!

1136
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,540
Oh!

1137
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,860
Can you see?

1138
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,360
Wait.

1139
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,000
You can't see.

1140
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,880
He's got his shirt off.

1141
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,460
He's got his shirt off.

1142
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,400
He's got his shirt off.

1143
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,860
I don't know why he's naked now.

1144
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,880
I don't know why he's naked now.

1145
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,420
He's a naked little man.

1146
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,260
That's creepy.

1147
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,920
Because he's a naked snake.

1148
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,160
No, that's solid snake.

1149
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,100
No, that's solid snake.

1150
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm surprised we haven't... I haven't had the...

1151
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,740
Max... Maybe I should keep...

1152
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,580
It won't let me max bet, so...

1153
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,580
It won't let me max bet, so...

1154
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,180
Yeah, I'm eating.

1155
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Oh.

1156
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,360
I love how she calls.

1157
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,640
She's like, hey, you eating?

1158
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,700
No, that is not solid snake.

1159
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,380
Oh.

1160
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,280
All right, guys.

1161
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,540
We got a ration last time.

1162
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,380
What do you think we're gonna get this time?

1163
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,580
Also, it's not...

1164
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,640
It's not like whenever I stop it.

1165
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,680
If I can be, like, here, and I stop it, and it'll still go to fork.

1166
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,020
So, here I'll...

1167
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,380
Here I'll try, like, on ammunition.

1168
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh!

1169
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,080
Oh!

1170
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,220
Oh!

1171
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,500
Oh!

1172
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,580
Oh!

1173
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,160
So, it's a skill issue.

1174
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,500
No!

1175
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,600
Okay, that was... Oh, it's glitching again.

1176
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,760
That is... That's awesome.

1177
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,340
That's not...

1178
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,220
Something happening.

1179
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,140
Or not something wrong with the screen.

1180
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,280
It's part of the game.

1181
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,560
Is it okay?

1182
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,080
Can you even call this a game?

1183
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,600
You were saying.

1184
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:45,860
Okay.

1185
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,560
Shh.

1186
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,060
Shh.

1187
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,800
Hush.

1188
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,140
Hush.

1189
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,560
Oh!

1190
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,620
Pshaw!

1191
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,280
Yeah!

1192
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,000
Pshaw!

1193
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,640
Okay.

1194
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,980
I got one, at least.

1195
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,260
Oh!

1196
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,620
Is it just a box?

1197
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,360
This is a game?

1198
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,920
You think so?

1199
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,040
It's a pay-to-win game.

1200
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,440
True.

1201
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,080
Nothing.

1202
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,700
No.

1203
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,280
That is... That is not a skill issue.

1204
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,740
Yeah!

1205
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,460
Oh!

1206
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,340
Come on, baby.

1207
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,360
We are Tiger Stripes.

1208
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,120
We are Tiger Stripes.

1209
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,960
Okay.

1210
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,420
Okay.

1211
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,840
Come on.

1212
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,560
Come on.

1213
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,440
Come on!

1214
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,240
Just a box!

1215
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,420
Box!

1216
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,200
Oh!

1217
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,300
Chance?

1218
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,600
Chance.

1219
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:43,800
Chance.

1220
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,700
Oh!

1221
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,120
Mister!

1222
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,140
What could it be?

1223
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh!

1224
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,480
Oh!

1225
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:57,840
Oh!

1226
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,620
They are looking around for me.

1227
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,800
Trying to find me.

1228
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,680
We are back to Sokolov.

1229
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,900
It's just a fever dream of scenes.

1230
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,740
Everything is all over the...

1231
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,380
We are back in the woods.

1232
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,740
What is going on?

1233
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,180
Why did Vulcan come out?

1234
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,960
We have no idea.

1235
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,740
He is doing his little thing.

1236
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,500
What is this?

1237
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,600
I just don't understand.

1238
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,160
It's all over the place.

1239
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,460
It actually is.

1240
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Usually it doesn't take this long to get to like a boss or something.

1241
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,300
I think my luck is actually just bad today.

1242
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,020
Oh!

1243
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,620
Okay.

1244
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,640
We are throwing the...

1245
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,140
What is that?

1246
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,440
Magazine?

1247
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,060
Okay.

1248
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,860
Still just a box.

1249
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,020
Someday.

1250
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,260
Someday.

1251
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,540
Oh!

1252
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,700
Today.

1253
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,920
Right now.

1254
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,320
Right now!

1255
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,080
Oh.

1256
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,560
Never mind.

1257
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,480
Oh.

1258
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,100
You are so... Just look the other way.

1259
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,460
All you have to do is look the opposite direction and you would have seen...

1260
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,340
Oh!

1261
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,820
Danyda!

1262
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,780
Thank you Ocelot for your direction.

1263
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,560
Thank you.

1264
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,280
Thank you.

1265
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,780
Basically he is saying like...

1266
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,660
I thought I saw him around here.

1267
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,480
Like he was definitely somewhere around here.

1268
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,400
Like he was definitely somewhere around here.

1269
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,120
No one here.

1270
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,360
They are idiots.

1271
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,140
180 IQ.

1272
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:32,620
180 IQ.

1273
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,880
Not stopping this stream until she beats the boss.

1274
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,800
This is the stream you guys.

1275
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,240
Oh!

1276
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,540
Sorry Ocelot!

1277
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,960
I was not listening to you.

1278
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,760
I was not even looking at the screen.

1279
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,940
I was not paying attention at all.

1280
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,520
I'm so sorry.

1281
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,040
Okay.

1282
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,480
Here we go.

1283
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,020
Okay.

1284
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,860
Ocelot is gonna get us the mystery thing.

1285
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,880
Because he loves snakes so much.

1286
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,500
Right now!

1287
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,560
Alright.

1288
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,040
Ocelot.

1289
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,040
Ocelot this... Whatever you...

1290
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,880
Whatever you decide for us will be...

1291
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,700
Will decide your true love.

1292
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,200
Okay?

1293
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,600
Okay?

1294
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,700
Oh!

1295
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,440
Oh my god.

1296
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,520
He knows...

1297
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,500
He knows that snake loves to eat.

1298
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,400
True love.

1299
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,960
Oh my god.

1300
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,580
He loves us for real.

1301
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,860
You are a simp.

1302
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,760
Ocelot.

1303
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,360
Didn't think we'd actually see this thing in action.

1304
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,220
PogChamp.

1305
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,080
I know her.

1306
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,400
Me too.

1307
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,760
Oh!

1308
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,180
What is this?

1309
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,080
I don't...

1310
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,880
Ocelot know... I don't know if like...

1311
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,320
He starts giving us direction.

1312
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,300
Like if the game feels bad for us.

1313
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,240
We're not getting any wins.

1314
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,600
So Ocelot is like...

1315
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,080
Hey I'm coming to help you.

1316
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,720
Her actions taste horrible though.

1317
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,180
I think it's better than eating a dead rat in the forest.

1318
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm just saying.

1319
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,900
An uncooked rat.

1320
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,250
An uncooked rat.

1321
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:02,470
Hmm?

1322
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,070
What is this?

1323
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,730
Pity pole.

1324
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,790
What is this?

1325
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,330
What is this?

1326
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,490
Okay.

1327
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,880
See?

1328
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,280
I was down here.

1329
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,820
And it still went to fork.

1330
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,500
I was down here.

1331
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,380
And it still went to fork.

1332
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,840
Rigged.

1333
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,480
Oh?

1334
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,040
Oh?

1335
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,480
That is...

1336
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,500
Space snake.

1337
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,520
Oh my god.

1338
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,120
Hahaha.

1339
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,110
Oh no.

1340
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:51,950
They're starting to multiply.

1341
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:52,810
Oh no.

1342
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,450
They're hanging out.

1343
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,130
Oh gosh.

1344
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,830
It's a party.

1345
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:55,570
We were not invited.

1346
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,670
Ocelot got the rations because snake is a snack.

1347
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,810
So true.

1348
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:02,970
A fork.

1349
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,650
Do you think he'll see us behind the tree?

1350
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:09,090
Do you think he'll see us behind the tree?

1351
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,730
Will we be spotted?

1352
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,620
I love that they're just like...

1353
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:22,780
Yeah.

1354
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,960
He's definitely here.

1355
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,420
Yeah.

1356
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,640
I definitely think I saw him.

1357
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah.

1358
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,400
I definitely think I saw him.

1359
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:28,940
Okay.

1360
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,680
Let's go, sir.

1361
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,700
Snow.

1362
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,340
They're just chilling.

1363
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,900
Yeah.

1364
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,920
You guys, my luck is kind of...

1365
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,440
I'm okay.

1366
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,540
He's like, how you doing?

1367
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,080
I'm good.

1368
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,160
How's your condition?

1369
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,160
We're stabbing him.

1370
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,440
Oh.

1371
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,180
Thank you.

1372
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,640
Oh my gosh.

1373
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,380
Paramedics saved us from the jungle.

1374
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Finally, we can continue forward.

1375
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,700
Hahaha.

1376
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,320
Eventually, we get there.

1377
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,480
You just have to spend enough money, obviously.

1378
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,320
Finally.

1379
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,280
The progress.

1380
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,820
Mysterious camouflage.

1381
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,780
Okay.

1382
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:12,960
Team.

1383
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,680
Okay.

1384
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,920
And there are different locations too.

1385
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,740
It's not always...

1386
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,620
It's not always...

1387
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,460
This area.

1388
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,320
So, I'm wondering if we'll see that as well.

1389
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,860
Last game.

1390
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,440
Okay.

1391
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,940
Let me out.

1392
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,240
Paramedic.

1393
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,560
White girl, save me.

1394
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,680
Hahaha.

1395
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,140
Save me, white girl.

1396
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,420
No.

1397
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,260
Hahaha.

1398
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:47,520
Hahaha.

1399
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,400
Hahaha.

1400
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,570
Alright.

1401
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,850
I'm gonna press it on ration.

1402
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,990
And we'll see what we get.

1403
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,930
Oh, I pressed it on ammunition box.

1404
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,910
But it still went to fork.

1405
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:05,230
Okay.

1406
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,210
Save me, white girl.

1407
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,230
Hahaha.

1408
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,490
Oh.

1409
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:13,150
Okay.

1410
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:15,610
Oh, there.

1411
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,950
We got the same thing twice in a row?

1412
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,090
That's kind of interesting.

1413
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:23,330
Yeah.

1414
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:23,870
This is...

1415
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,810
This whole thing is Mendo.

1416
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,370
Please get me out of the forest.

1417
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:26,810
Please.

1418
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,890
The jungles of Russia.

1419
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,030
I'm so sick of it.

1420
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,590
I don't want to see the jungles of Russia any longer.

1421
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,230
Please.

1422
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,450
You got forked.

1423
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,690
At least we have enough forks to share the single ration with awesome.

1424
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,330
Hahaha.

1425
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,950
Oh, we took him out.

1426
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,030
Alright.

1427
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:49,430
Oh!

1428
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:50,490
We

1429
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,520
got bullets!

1430
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,760
There's jungles in Russia?

1431
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,800
Yes, according to Metal Gear Solid 3.

1432
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,540
There are jungles in Russia.

1433
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,440
Isn't that the most fascinating thing?

1434
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,240
Oh!

1435
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,140
It's Zero!

1436
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,760
Oh, Zero.

1437
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,100
Monday night.

1438
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,400
Oh, she's responding.

1439
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,460
Tiger strike.

1440
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,840
Bullet.

1441
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,040
Hahaha.

1442
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,980
Bullet.

1443
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:26,670
Okay, you guys.

1444
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,450
Alright.

1445
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:28,890
Okay.

1446
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,370
Oh, this one's fun!

1447
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,430
Because this is the one with the dogs!

1448
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,390
So, uh...

1449
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,750
If we make it out, we get to jump off the...

1450
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,010
Okay, come on.

1451
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,450
Alright.

1452
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:44,930
Alright.

1453
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:45,910
Let's go!

1454
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,210
Let's go!

1455
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:46,910
Let's go!

1456
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:49,350
Nice.

1457
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:50,250
Nice.

1458
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:50,590
Next.

1459
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:53,890
Nice!

1460
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,570
Nice!

1461
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:54,970
Nice!

1462
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,130
Nice!

1463
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,290
The sound of the dogs is so sad though.

1464
00:52:58,530 --> 00:52:59,230
Bow-wow.

1465
00:52:59,410 --> 00:52:59,610
Bow-wow.

1466
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,590
Bow-wow.

1467
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:01,970
Hup!

1468
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,870
Weep-weep-weep-weep!

1469
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:06,910
Oh, my god.

1470
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,060
Let's go!

1471
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,040
Bow-wow.

1472
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,120
Bow-wow!

1473
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,220
Oh, my god.

1474
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:23,620
Please.

1475
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,240
Please.

1476
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,400
Please.

1477
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,200
Please.

1478
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,240
Please, Sokolov.

1479
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,900
Can't we just leave him?

1480
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,400
We could just leave him, right?

1481
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,080
We got the bow-bow virus.

1482
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,800
Nope, not yet, not yet.

1483
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:52,920
Good.

1484
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,380
We need more bullets.

1485
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,560
Hmm.

1486
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,000
Hmm.

1487
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,360
Hmm.

1488
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,020
Oh wait, I forgot this was just the one to choose the guy.

1489
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,570
Not yet.

1490
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:21,650
Okay, I think you have to get it in the first try to get great, right?

1491
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,950
Oh, nope, just kidding.

1492
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,670
I proved myself wrong again.

1493
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,790
One last... one last guy.

1494
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,270
Okay, alright, here we go.

1495
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,500
Alright, come on.

1496
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,140
The audio fixed.

1497
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,480
Oh, was it out of sync before?

1498
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,660
That's so weird.

1499
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,960
Is this better now?

1500
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,600
Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.

1501
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,080
I thought... I thought you meant like there was an echo in that like you could hear me twice.

1502
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,160
I didn't realize that it was like a delayed echo.

1503
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,580
It was double for me when I joined the... I'm so sorry.

1504
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,100
Oh my gosh, it must have been really awful to listen to.

1505
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,580
I'm so sorry.

1506
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,310
That's so... yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

1507
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,720
It must have been so annoying to listen to.

1508
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,580
It's

1509
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,760
been two times enjoying my...

1510
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,600
Cha-da!

1511
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,560
I was hoping that I could like channel my energy into that.

1512
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,360
Look at Tiny Ocelot, he's just so goofy looking.

1513
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:01,680
Oh!

1514
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,560
Okay, okay.

1515
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,520
Okay, come on, Snake.

1516
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,260
Snake.

1517
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,260
Snake!

1518
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,900
Snake, don't miss!

1519
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:08,940
Snake!

1520
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,440
Snake.

1521
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,220
Snake.

1522
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,020
Snake, please.

1523
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,200
Snake, please.

1524
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,540
Oh my god, please.

1525
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,620
Please.

1526
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,820
Please to god, Snake, we need to continue.

1527
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,160
Please, Snake.

1528
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,260
I'm begging you.

1529
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:20,940
I'm begging you.

1530
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,780
I'm on my knees, please.

1531
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,360
Snake!

1532
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,740
Snake, don't miss!

1533
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,540
Don't miss!

1534
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,080
Yes!

1535
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:49,620
Also, you can't tell, but my credits have not gone down at all, which is very impressive.

1536
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,380
12 hour stream, let's go.

1537
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,380
It already has been an hour and we haven't barely seen any of the game.

1538
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,980
You know what?

1539
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,700
Actually...

1540
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,880
Hold on.

1541
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,800
Hold on.

1542
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,420
I think... let me try changing the game mode.

1543
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,660
Next time I have the option to go to the menu.

1544
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,420
Let me... let me try changing the game mode.

1545
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,380
Because maybe being on normal is kind of messing some stuff up.

1546
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,780
Do you own this machine?

1547
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,400
Hi, Hana!

1548
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,540
Yeah, this is my... this is my patchy slot machine.

1549
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,480
It's my baby.

1550
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,540
Hold on.

1551
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,980
It's got a light up, so we can go to it.

1552
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,160
Thanks for the donut!

1553
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,660
Double mint is fine, but this works too.

1554
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,860
How much time have you spent playing this exactly?

1555
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,060
Probably less than you'd imagine.

1556
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,800
Like, I'll, like, every so often, like, you know, do it.

1557
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:02,460
Or I usually turn it on when I, like, if I... I say when, but it's really if I have company over.

1558
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,560
Because it's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like a...

1559
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,940
What's the word?

1560
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,560
Strange thing to have.

1561
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,660
Oh, no!

1562
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,240
The echo's back!

1563
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,100
Is it better if I just do this?

1564
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,700
Thank you, Zero!

1565
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,240
Is it better if I just do that?

1566
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,920
It's worse?

1567
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,400
Wait, way better.

1568
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,780
What's the echo?

1569
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,880
You guys are so weird!

1570
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,760
I think the echo's better than mine.

1571
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,580
Okay.

1572
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,280
I'll trust Hana's opinion.

1573
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,040
I'll trust Hana's opinion.

1574
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,160
Hold on, I'm paying out.

1575
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,680
There we go.

1576
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,040
Okay.

1577
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,600
Classic mode.

1578
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,300
Let's change it to classic.

1579
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,280
And now we will retry.

1580
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,920
We will retry.

1581
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,380
Do you ever just get up in the middle of the night and just go one more spin?

1582
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,300
It's a...

1583
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,340
It's a...

1584
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,700
There are definitely times when I am playing on it that I'm just like, okay, I'll end on a win.

1585
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,600
And as you can tell, that's not easy.

1586
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,880
I don't even think there's a true way of beating this, you know?

1587
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,700
Like, I don't even know if you can fight the boss.

1588
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,860
Though I do know you can fight the four bosses.

1589
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,200
Or the four, like, you can fight the fear, the fury, the end, and the pain.

1590
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,480
Look at this.

1591
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,940
We're just, we're hitting nothing.

1592
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:48,940
It is...

1593
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,180
Oh, the tree is in the way.

1594
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh my god.

1595
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,620
Take him out.

1596
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,500
Have you changed the difficulty inside?

1597
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,380
Is there a way to do that?

1598
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,420
I'll be honest, this thing hasn't really... it never came with an instruction manual.

1599
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,300
It came with a piece of paper.

1600
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,740
So I, uh...

1601
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,560
Can you die in this?

1602
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,960
You can do boss battles, and when you die, you just go back to this area.

1603
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,380
It's like the beginning, you know?

1604
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,950
But yeah.

1605
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,850
I don't know, actually, how to, uh...

1606
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,030
If there's a way to change the difficulty on the inside.

1607
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,530
I don't know.

1608
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,690
Load the last save.

1609
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:40,590
Okay, guys.

1610
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,450
I'm guessing key.

1611
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,090
Key!

1612
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:46,670
Key!

1613
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,210
I'm gonna press it on ammunition.

1614
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:51,610
Damn.

1615
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,570
It's actually really easy.

1616
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:56,550
It takes, like, less than a minute.

1617
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,070
If you have both keys, I can tell you how...

1618
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,450
I do have both keys!

1619
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:03,150
I do!

1620
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,310
This is the one to open.

1621
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,210
And then this is the one for the...

1622
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,030
For the... uh... what's it called?

1623
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:11,310
Key.

1624
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,690
What's it... um... hold on.

1625
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,330
Something... something key.

1626
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:19,830
I don't remember.

1627
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,090
Though I don't wanna do it right now, obviously.

1628
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,110
Because I would have to open this up.

1629
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,050
And it's gonna disturb my setup.

1630
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,190
But I would love to know how for the future.

1631
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,990
Because...

1632
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:34,090
Oh.

1633
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:35,910
Nevermind.

1634
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,030
Why would you tease me?

1635
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,350
Oh!

1636
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,470
Snow!

1637
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,510
One day.

1638
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,530
But I kind of like... I don't know.

1639
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,210
Maybe I'm...

1640
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,490
Oh!

1641
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:51,730
Oh!

1642
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,610
Snow again!

1643
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:54,610
Didn't we... I don't understand.

1644
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,230
I don't...

1645
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,870
I just... I don't understand.

1646
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,810
The mechanics.

1647
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,170
I don't get it at all.

1648
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,150
I don't understand.

1649
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,070
Why do we get snow and then we get snow again?

1650
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,410
What is the point of the snow?

1651
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,770
Why do I get camouflage?

1652
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,370
But it doesn't do anything.

1653
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,850
Why do I get camouflage and then when I go to...

1654
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,870
When I go to... uh...

1655
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,290
The Virtuous Mission?

1656
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,650
My... my thing is at zero or question mark?

1657
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,970
I don't get it!

1658
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,030
It's so confusing!

1659
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:19,810
Oh, I messed up.

1660
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:22,830
What?

1661
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:23,030
What?

1662
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,490
Hidden modifiers?

1663
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,830
It has to be there, right?

1664
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,590
Don't move.

1665
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,070
Don't move.

1666
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,370
Why did an extra weapon disappear?

1667
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,450
Please.

1668
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:50,310
Please.

1669
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,090
Just something happened.

1670
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,490
Snow!

1671
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,770
Oh, my god!

1672
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,990
It's just like Oops.

1673
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,510
Animals!

1674
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:09,710
Animals!

1675
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,430
Animals!

1676
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,150
Animals 70%!

1677
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,470
We just got this!

1678
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,910
We did it!

1679
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,370
We did it!

1680
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,270
We did it!

1681
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,290
We got animals!

1682
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,570
We got it!

1683
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,730
Oh, what did it do?

1684
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:38,550
Who knows?

1685
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,610
The tree...

1686
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,430
Push?

1687
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,350
I've never had to push!

1688
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,930
I've never had to push!

1689
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:04,510
Wait!

1690
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:05,830
We skipped!

1691
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:06,470
We skipped!

1692
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:06,930
We skipped!

1693
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,230
What?

1694
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,770
Oh my god.

1695
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,050
It's never lit up like that before.

1696
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,310
It's so dramatic, I know.

1697
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,230
Why did it happen?

1698
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,030
I have no idea.

1699
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,870
I have no idea.

1700
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,350
What's going on?

1701
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,090
What's going on?

1702
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:27,950
Okay.

1703
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,690
Come on.

1704
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:30,570
All right, snake.

1705
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:31,410
Get a...

1706
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,570
Tony the tiger!

1707
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,570
He's... great!

1708
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:35,210
Yeah!

1709
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,250
That's two for two.

1710
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,210
That's two for two, baby!

1711
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,610
Okay.

1712
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,890
Works every time!

1713
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,400
Works every time.

1714
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,920
Lady, look.

1715
01:04:58,660 --> 01:04:59,300
Tiger!

1716
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,200
He's...

1717
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,760
Just wanted to let you know that I'm starting off my birthday watching you play Metal Gear Slot, and I can't imagine a better way to spend it.

1718
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,020
Marika, happy birthday!

1719
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,900
Oh my god, Asel!

1720
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:20,500
Hello!

1721
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,640
Long time no see.

1722
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,280
Here we

1723
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:30,530
go.

1724
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:32,590
Now I want Frosted Flakes.

1725
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,670
Um...

1726
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,680
I... I have a distinct memory of, um, Frosted Flakes from, like...

1727
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,080
You know how, uh...

1728
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,880
Well, at, like, some...

1729
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:46,720
Great!

1730
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,580
At some, uh, like, hotels and stuff, um, in the United States...

1731
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,820
Like, when... If they have breakfast...

1732
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:56,580
Uh...

1733
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
You can get, like, the little cereal boxes.

1734
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,140
Um... Yeah, the mini boxes!

1735
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:03,580
Yeah!

1736
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,700
I never would, um...

1737
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,060
I never... Uh, my mom never got Frosted Flakes.

1738
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,880
Well, she really never got, um...

1739
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,040
Like, any kind of, like, sugary cereals like that for me as a kid.

1740
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:22,800
There was one cereal that she would get that, like, I very lovingly call, um...

1741
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,980
Cardboard O's because they just had no flavor.

1742
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,720
I think... I think those kind of messed me up for life.

1743
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:36,680
Because my pa... my taste palette has been very directly influenced by Cardboard O's.

1744
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,240
So...

1745
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:39,540
Cheerios?

1746
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,260
No, no, no!

1747
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,280
They were, uh...

1748
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,420
They were... They were Cheerios from, like, one of those health food stores.

1749
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,660
Okay, come on.

1750
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Oh, gosh, you guys.

1751
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,280
I'm not feeling...

1752
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,400
I don't know.

1753
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,060
I don't know.

1754
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,400
I'm feeling nervous.

1755
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,160
Oh, I'm sweating!

1756
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,620
Oh, I'm sweating!

1757
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,360
Snake, please!

1758
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:03,940
Please.

1759
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:04,960
Please, Snake.

1760
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,540
Please, God.

1761
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,380
I'm not gonna look.

1762
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:06,900
I'm not gonna look.

1763
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,560
I'm not gonna look.

1764
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,060
I'm not gonna look.

1765
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,020
Oh.

1766
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:15,050
Ugh.

1767
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:28,690
Ugh.

1768
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,530
Choo!

1769
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,250
Open machine.

1770
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,110
Turn switch under small key off.

1771
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,510
Put in small key and turn.

1772
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,330
Turn on switch below key.

1773
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:46,290
On back of door, look for red number with button behind small plastic sliding door.

1774
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,850
Push button to change difficulty.

1775
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,250
One through six.

1776
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,990
One hard, easy six.

1777
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:52,390
Continue.

1778
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:52,950
Oh, my gosh.

1779
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,730
It's so funny because I know exactly what you're talking about with the...

1780
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,830
With, like, the buttons and the keys.

1781
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,690
I'm like, oh, okay.

1782
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:00,850
I know where those are.

1783
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:01,490
Yes, yes.

1784
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:06,590
You guys, this is so pathetic.

1785
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:07,110
I know.

1786
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,490
I finally... I finally can show you my patchy sla... I mean, final... I mean, oh.

1787
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:17,390
I can show you Apache's... Apache's slot machine that...

1788
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:22,570
I've had this for a while and I've... I've always wanted to show people.

1789
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:24,490
And...

1790
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,160
It's going crazy.

1791
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,100
Sorry.

1792
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,760
There's also supposed to be a volume control.

1793
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,220
There is.

1794
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,540
Actually, I haven't turned much down because it usually was very loud.

1795
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,360
Anyway...

1796
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:52,940
Anyway...

1797
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,380
What was I saying?

1798
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,040
But my game... My game is camera shy.

1799
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,960
It's getting... What's the word?

1800
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:11,080
You know when you do poorly when people are watching you?

1801
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,700
What's that word?

1802
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,280
Performance anxiety!

1803
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,160
Yes.

1804
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,460
Performance anxiety.

1805
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,740
Stage fright.

1806
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,240
Oh.

1807
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,800
Bullets!

1808
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,500
I mean, you love Metal Gear, so shouldn't you be thrilled for the excuse to just keep playing it indefinitely?

1809
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,420
So true.

1810
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,220
Godzilla!

1811
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:42,480
Godzilla!

1812
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,860
Oh my gosh, these guys are so stupid.

1813
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:47,760
No!

1814
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,920
Come on, animals.

1815
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,490
We're making out in the jungle with this one.

1816
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,310
I don't... You guys, I don't think so.

1817
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,450
Oh, oh!

1818
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,390
Chance?

1819
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:00,930
Wait.

1820
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,690
There... Before in the background it said chance, but this time it didn't.

1821
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,290
So maybe the chance is under the...

1822
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:09,110
No?

1823
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,330
It's a mis... I don't know.

1824
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:11,650
What?

1825
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,030
What just happened?

1826
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:15,650
Oh?

1827
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:17,750
What

1828
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:21,520
is this?

1829
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,870
Suddenly Grozny.

1830
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:28,670
I know.

1831
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,850
Oh, we get Sokolov again.

1832
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,550
What is this?

1833
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,010
This guy.

1834
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,530
Two.

1835
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:41,310
After choosing difficulty, go back to front and push knob down a few times until the red number turns to zero.

1836
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:46,310
Then just turn small key back off and you're done.

1837
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,070
Thank you.

1838
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,710
Thank you, Dave.

1839
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,590
I appreciate it.

1840
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,890
We never met, but I'm happy to see you're back.

1841
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:52,670
Thank you.

1842
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,370
I hope you're here to stay.

1843
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,730
I'm looking forward to seeing you more often.

1844
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:56,710
Thank you so much.

1845
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:01,210
Okay.

1846
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,450
What do you think, guys?

1847
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:03,630
What do you think?

1848
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,730
Sokolov is very inquisitive.

1849
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:06,390
Oh my god, yeah.

1850
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,170
I... It drives me... Like, you're the one burning those papers.

1851
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,810
What do you mean you don't know what's on it?

1852
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:13,970
Fork?

1853
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:14,730
Fork?

1854
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,150
Cigar?

1855
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:15,930
Cigar?

1856
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:16,370
Cigar?

1857
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:17,790
Cigar?

1858
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,050
Cigar?

1859
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,910
This is like a... What's it called?

1860
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:23,630
Family feud?

1861
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,790
The board says cigar!

1862
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,630
All on fork.

1863
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:37,450
Well, minty fresh Kyle, it's your minty fresh day.

1864
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:44,150
You better go play the lottery, buddy, because who would have thought we would get fork again?

1865
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:46,430
Oh my god, paramedic is so cute.

1866
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,810
Even when she's looking at my insides.

1867
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,030
Don't look.

1868
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,970
Don't look at my pelvis.

1869
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,850
You'll see my sciatica.

1870
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:58,890
Or not my sciatica.

1871
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,110
You'll see my scoliosis.

1872
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,990
Oh my god, it's paramedic.

1873
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,910
She's like, I love that curve of your spine, snake.

1874
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:12,190
Boo.

1875
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:12,590
Boo!

1876
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:14,750
Bullets!

1877
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:16,990
It can't work every time.

1878
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,390
Scoliosis in your pelvis?

1879
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,150
No!

1880
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,510
Ooh, I like the effect it has.

1881
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,070
Ooh, that is so cool, right?

1882
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:30,350
It's such a nice machine.

1883
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,610
It just looks so good.

1884
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:37,630
Unfortunately, mine is a little cracked up in the corner of the snake.

1885
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:42,750
You can kind of see, like, the breakage a little bit.

1886
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:53,550
Um, but if I were to want to get it fixed, I would have to send the entire thing back.

1887
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,750
And they would have to replace this whole panel.

1888
01:12:56,030 --> 01:13:02,910
It would be, uh, it's more of a pain in the ass than I'm willing to deal with, so...

1889
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:07,110
Tiger.

1890
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,590
Tiger.

1891
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,750
T-T-T-T-T-Tiger.

1892
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,550
Are you planning to buy more machines?

1893
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:17,970
No, I don't need more than one, unless I get, what, Metal Gear Arcade?

1894
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,250
I don't know if I'm that crazy, though.

1895
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,030
Here's another trick.

1896
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:27,510
There's a hidden set of patterns on the snake that tell you when to push the buttons to get streaks.

1897
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,830
But you can only see it if you equip the...

1898
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,610
Stop lying to me!

1899
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,710
Don't lie!

1900
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,450
It's ugly.

1901
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,730
It's ugly when you lie on the internet.

1902
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:40,590
Hahaha.

1903
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:45,970
Don't tell lies!

1904
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,770
It makes you go bald!

1905
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,470
Bald isn't ugly.

1906
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:54,610
But if you like to have hair, then it would be kind of sad.

1907
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,390
I'm just saying.

1908
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,410
Oh no!

1909
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:05,270
My hair!

1910
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:11,170
Is the audio doubled or is it just the room?

1911
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:16,330
Yeah, unfortunately there's like some strange audio issues I'm having.

1912
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:22,730
What a scuff stream to have as my first actual stream back.

1913
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,330
This is so... I'm so sorry.

1914
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,550
What is this?

1915
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:32,150
Bald likes Sokolov.

1916
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,410
I think Sokolov's... I mean, yeah, he's a little bald.

1917
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,890
I think Sokolov's bald!

1918
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:41,530
Hahaha.

1919
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,810
It's a perfect stream.

1920
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:45,630
I'm loving it.

1921
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,010
You guys are just saying that to make me feel better.

1922
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:53,250
You're just like, we can't say bad things or else she'll ghost us.

1923
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,390
Oh my god.

1924
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,110
Curve of your spine.

1925
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:05,970
Ooh, baby.

1926
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:11,390
I don't know why it makes him look so old.

1927
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,570
Oh, sorry, you can't really see it, I guess.

1928
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:17,250
It gives him like these weird smile lines.

1929
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,610
I guess they're on a skull, huh?

1930
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:20,730
I don't know.

1931
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,970
I'm a ghost, not a skele- I'm a ghost, not a skeleton.

1932
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,100
Skeleton is old mint.

1933
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,240
It would be really fun to...

1934
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:42,580
Oh my gosh, what if we find my grave and we dig me up?

1935
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,340
Oh my gosh.

1936
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,420
You guys, what do you think I'm buried with?

1937
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,800
It's kind of embarrassing.

1938
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,520
Oh my gosh, what if you dig me up and you find my skeleton?

1939
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,600
Oh my gosh, what if you grave rob me?

1940
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,240
What if you open up my grave and I'm just gelatinous?

1941
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:05,800
Decomposing.

1942
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,400
I love hearing you have so much fun playing with the slot machine.

1943
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:18,040
I'm eating Mike Tyson's butt!

1944
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,600
Thank you!

1945
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,200
Let's do it!

1946
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,360
Very wormy.

1947
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,180
Oh my gosh, we're never making it out of the Russian German Ghouls, you guys.

1948
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,940
I'm afraid to say.

1949
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,580
I changed the game mode, but I don't think it changed anything.

1950
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,760
The legend.

1951
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,180
Thank you guys for all the donations.

1952
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,700
I really, really appreciate it.

1953
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,300
The man, the myth, the legend.

1954
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:09,960
For those who are wondering about memberships, I don't get a monetization until I post three videos.

1955
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,260
So this is the second one.

1956
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,700
And then it says I need more watch hours too.

1957
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,780
So I guess maybe sometime next week we'll get it.

1958
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,420
Hopefully.

1959
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,520
Maybe.

1960
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,200
I don't know.

1961
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,960
I still don't know what to do for memberships.

1962
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,340
Kind of, I think...

1963
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,600
Oh, sorry.

1964
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,120
I was thinking so much and I just ended up pressing buttons.

1965
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,840
Levyman, thank you!

1966
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,660
Thank you so much.

1967
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:53,580
Because for memberships, I do plan on maybe doing some streams.

1968
01:17:53,900 --> 01:18:01,540
I'm going to put it at like a lower tier though because of the podcast and having the Patreon.

1969
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:07,680
Because Matara and I will be doing like some extra streams and games and things on there.

1970
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,060
So that's a little bit more of my priority.

1971
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:18,600
So my memberships will be probably like tiered much less.

1972
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,440
But yeah.

1973
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:28,320
So I do obviously still plan to do stuff with memberships.

1974
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,380
And then there will be the emotes if you guys want that.

1975
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,200
So less than $5.

1976
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,720
Less than $5 is what I'm thinking.

1977
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,740
Yeah, like either $2 or $3.

1978
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,320
So mm-mm.

1979
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,140
Make them $44?

1980
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,060
Are you crazy?

1981
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,700
I thought you said four.

1982
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:48,020
Four makes sense because obviously it's a spooky number.

1983
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,620
But not 44.

1984
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,020
But yeah.

1985
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,340
Four, four, four.

1986
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,020
Four, what a deal!

1987
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:01,980
No.

1988
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:02,780
Simple.

1989
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,540
Will we get out of the jungle when Delta releases?

1990
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,180
Yeah.

1991
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:12,000
Maybe the game, maybe my patchy slot is feeling like a little insecure.

1992
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,400
It's just like you're going to abandon me once Delta comes out.

1993
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,940
You're not going to love this snake anymore.

1994
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,800
You're going to love other snakes.

1995
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,860
He's going to be even more high def.

1996
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,660
He looks so good though.

1997
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,300
Oh my gosh.

1998
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,200
He looks so awesome.

1999
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,160
He looks so good.

2000
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:31,080
Everybody looks so good except Eva.

2001
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,460
Sorry.

2002
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,720
Eva in this, something about her just looks a little off.

2003
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,380
Like her hair looks a little wiry.

2004
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,940
Her face just looks a little off.

2005
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,460
I don't know what it is.

2006
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:43,860
I don't know.

2007
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,620
Sorry, Eva.

2008
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,700
Grave robbing membership stream.

2009
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:56,180
If we dig you up and find your skeleton clutching a suppressed H&K MK23 in a bag of cursed sand.

2010
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,540
What is this a reference to?

2011
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,700
Eva, my wife.

2012
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,380
I love Eva.

2013
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:12,340
I think I'm very excited to see how she looks in Delta because how I and also Ocelot looks a little weird in this too.

2014
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,180
So it's not just her.

2015
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,260
The two of them look a little weird.

2016
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:17,800
Like hold on.

2017
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:18,720
Hold on.

2018
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,520
Give me the menu.

2019
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,060
Hold on.

2020
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,700
I'm going to pay out.

2021
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,940
Not that it matters.

2022
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,700
We haven't done anything.

2023
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:28,580
Okay.

2024
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:29,640
Um.

2025
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,320
Because you can see.

2026
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:34,620
No.

2027
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,360
Get me out of here.

2028
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:40,700
Okay.

2029
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,120
Never mind.

2030
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,460
Um.

2031
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,660
They have a picture of Ocelot which is why I wanted to bring up the menu.

2032
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,020
He just looks a little goofy.

2033
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,240
Welcome back.

2034
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:01,780
Thank you.

2035
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,320
Thank you so much.

2036
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:04,760
Oh.

2037
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,100
Hello.

2038
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:05,340
It's okay.

2039
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:06,720
Oh.

2040
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,020
What is this?

2041
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,040
How does the boss look?

2042
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:13,900
She looks perfect.

2043
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,000
Oh my god.

2044
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,180
She looks...

2045
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,680
Like her and Snake.

2046
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,740
I feel like they had the most love put into them.

2047
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,400
I mean the boss...

2048
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,740
The other boss is looking too.

2049
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,920
But...

2050
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,920
Her and...

2051
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,280
Oh.

2052
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,680
Her and Snake looks stupidly good.

2053
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,720
They look so perfect.

2054
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,820
What is this?

2055
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,320
Just so much.

2056
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,340
I'm going to throw you into that for sure.

2057
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:35,560
Fire.

2058
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,380
If you don't say something else, please.

2059
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,780
I think I'm turning into the Joker.

2060
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,100
Oh my god, no, please!

2061
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,280
Don't say it.

2062
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,960
Don't say it.

2063
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:43,920
Don't you dare.

2064
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:44,740
Don't say it.

2065
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:45,860
Don't say it.

2066
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:59,660
There's an Umineko patchy slot for 250 right now in Nara and you're making it really hard for me to not hit buy.

2067
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,840
That's not a bad price at all.

2068
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,800
I think with this patchy slot...

2069
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:11,320
I can't... I have never played any other patchy slot games before.

2070
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,600
Well, patchy slot is true.

2071
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:20,260
I have tried like a pachinko machine at a convention before a long time ago and it was whatever.

2072
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:25,300
I don't even remember like what anime series it was, if it even was one.

2073
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:34,780
But I feel like a considerable amount of effort went into went into this one.

2074
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,640
I don't know.

2075
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:45,860
There's just a lot going on and obviously you have like the HD graphics, so it just feels like a lot of love.

2076
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,060
Not love.

2077
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,560
Maybe that's the wrong word.

2078
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:52,140
A lot of something.

2079
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,240
Effort.

2080
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,280
Effort went into this.

2081
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:06,140
Sorry, I'm trying to choose my words carefully.

2082
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,760
Going, going, going.

2083
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,180
That's what I'm trying to do.

2084
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,140
Please, let me through.

2085
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,260
Oh my god, finally.

2086
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,660
Something has happened.

2087
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,100
Oh my god.

2088
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,260
Please.

2089
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,200
Please, please.

2090
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,400
Let me, let me go somewhere else.

2091
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,260
The game pity me for once.

2092
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,820
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

2093
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,280
I'm so tired.

2094
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,660
Don't say it.

2095
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,520
Don't say it.

2096
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,560
Don't say it.

2097
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,550
What is this?

2098
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,910
What is this?

2099
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,810
He's gonna say it.

2100
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:59,390
Snow!

2101
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:06,410
Oh, this is like probably the worst round we've gotten so far.

2102
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:10,530
If I get the chance, I'm gonna maybe change the game mode again.

2103
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:11,370
Okay, guys.

2104
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,950
What is this?

2105
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:19,130
This is gonna become a meme on my channel.

2106
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,250
Like everybody, something happened.

2107
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:22,410
What is this?

2108
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,330
Alright, everybody.

2109
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,290
Place your bets.

2110
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:29,530
Cigar.

2111
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:30,810
I really want the cigar.

2112
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,330
I don't think I know what he says when he gets the cigar.

2113
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:37,190
When he gets the fork, he says like, I don't need this right now.

2114
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:45,390
H&K MK23 is the SOCOM pistol from the game.

2115
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,810
Are you sure you're a Metal Gear fan?

2116
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,850
No, I knew that!

2117
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:49,790
I didn't know what the bag of...

2118
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,810
the bag of...

2119
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,290
dirt or whatever they said was.

2120
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,990
I didn't know.

2121
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,850
What is this?

2122
01:24:58,450 --> 01:24:59,530
Alright, cigar!

2123
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:01,570
Oh, yeah.

2124
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,410
Yeah, he says I don't need it right now.

2125
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:06,250
Ration, he says like, not bad.

2126
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:10,010
Ammunition, I don't remember what he says because I haven't gotten it enough times.

2127
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,030
And cigar and key, I have no idea.

2128
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,150
And then obviously the secret.

2129
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,350
I have no idea.

2130
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,210
Forked!

2131
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,490
Get forked again, nerd!

2132
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:22,350
Tiger's draw.

2133
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:26,830
You guys, I'm starting to lose hope.

2134
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,650
I'm starting to lose hope, please.

2135
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,170
Ammos, he says ocelot, my love.

2136
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:35,770
Really?

2137
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,550
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2138
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,430
Another chance!

2139
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:41,930
Chance, chance!

2140
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:45,530
Forked.

2141
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,270
Again.

2142
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,490
I'm getting forked in the butt here, man.

2143
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:52,250
Oh, oh, oh!

2144
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,250
Okay, come on, come on, come on!

2145
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,850
Come on, come on, come on!

2146
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:55,990
Come on, come on!

2147
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:57,810
Boo!

2148
01:25:58,890 --> 01:25:59,170
Mama!

2149
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:05,700
Tiger's draw.

2150
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,660
I think because it's like the worst result.

2151
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,360
Okay.

2152
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:17,880
What did that mean?

2153
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,900
I don't know.

2154
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,280
I don't know anything that goes on in this.

2155
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:24,640
I literally just push buttons and I pray.

2156
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,460
I pray something is going to happen.

2157
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,620
Can I get the menu again, please?

2158
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:33,860
Okay.

2159
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,740
Paramedic, please.

2160
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:38,940
Oh!

2161
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,100
Oh!

2162
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:42,580
We haven't gotten this one.

2163
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:44,660
Oh!

2164
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,140
Oh, no, we got caught!

2165
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:46,860
Oh, no!

2166
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,260
Paramedic!

2167
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,520
It's going to go into caution after this, though.

2168
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,100
Oh.

2169
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,160
Bullets!

2170
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,160
Nice, nice, nice.

2171
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:16,900
Nice, nice.

2172
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,220
Let's just go to the other side.

2173
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:20,860
Nope.

2174
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,860
Just a tree.

2175
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,320
The tree is in the way now.

2176
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,300
That's what I get for...

2177
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,280
for cosplaying a tree.

2178
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,840
He took offense.

2179
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,340
Alright, get out of here.

2180
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,900
Run away, you losers.

2181
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,300
Oh my god, the music is so awesome.

2182
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,720
Okay, now we're in caution.

2183
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:55,920
What is this?

2184
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,320
What is this?

2185
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,820
If it goes well, there's a chance.

2186
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,530
I think the umaku part is difficult.

2187
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:19,590
He's... he's...

2188
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,990
so thick!

2189
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,310
My god!

2190
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,950
He is... he is...

2191
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:29,970
I'm so... how thick did they have to make this tree to allow him to stand behind it?

2192
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,130
Like, this guy!

2193
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,550
Look at the size of him!

2194
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,810
I can't even...

2195
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:39,170
I can barely fit my fingers to his length!

2196
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,970
Like, it's crazy!

2197
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,470
Oh, dang it!

2198
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,750
Oh, I just realized it was on.

2199
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:43,990
Uh oh, I missed it.

2200
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,750
We're still in caution mode.

2201
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,150
The music is so awesome, right?

2202
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,770
Absolute unit.

2203
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,850
That's what I'm saying.

2204
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,250
Snake been eating good.

2205
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,530
Fit your fingers where?

2206
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:03,890
Like a...

2207
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:05,710
To... to...

2208
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:08,490
Like a... like a ruler, right?

2209
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,150
What did I say?

2210
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,270
Wait, now I'm scared.

2211
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:15,370
Wait, what did I say?

2212
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,710
Does the bottom screen do anything?

2213
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:18,950
No, it's all one screen.

2214
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,630
It's just for decoration.

2215
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,230
So, um...

2216
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:27,750
But, when, uh...

2217
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,170
When we get theater mode...

2218
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:32,170
If we get theater mode...

2219
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:34,310
If we get theater mode...

2220
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,190
It will be on the whole thing.

2221
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:38,130
So, that's really awesome.

2222
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,890
Um, that's when it shows, like, the...

2223
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:46,170
It plays Snake Eater and shows, like, the scenes from the game while you play.

2224
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:48,750
Crossing my fingers.

2225
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:53,910
Safety!

2226
01:29:58,130 --> 01:29:59,450
Yeah, I'm hungry.

2227
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,510
Okay, you're not gonna do anything about it.

2228
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,370
It's pretty cool you own something like this.

2229
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:07,270
Thanks.

2230
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,470
I like it too.

2231
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:12,670
Snow.

2232
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,470
Yeah, we're picking snow...

2233
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:16,910
in this location.

2234
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:18,130
Makes absolute sense.

2235
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:20,730
Come on, streamer luck.

2236
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:21,950
I don't think there is...

2237
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,710
I don't believe anymore.

2238
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,010
I don't believe in stream...

2239
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,810
streamer luck anymore.

2240
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:28,490
I think...

2241
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,070
Hold on, I'm gonna take a sip of your water.

2242
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,720
How do you progress?

2243
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,640
Is it all random?

2244
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,460
I think so!

2245
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,280
I think it's all random.

2246
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,160
Um...

2247
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,140
I see a wind coming soon.

2248
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,120
Psycho Mantis?

2249
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,060
Yeah, everybody, hydrate!

2250
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,340
Drink your water.

2251
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,660
We've been sweating trying to get these winds.

2252
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,480
You know, but...

2253
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,820
you make sure you're hydrated.

2254
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,080
Chill!

2255
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:11,980
When you're having a bad day, are you more of the type of ghost to go to the bar and drown your sorrows and booze?

2256
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:16,260
Or the type to haunt elevators to try to lift your spirits?

2257
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:20,720
Boo!

2258
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,400
Boo!

2259
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,540
Increasing the patchy slot luck?

2260
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,520
Thank you!

2261
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,320
Thank you, Amelia!

2262
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:30,700
Thank you!

2263
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,740
Oh my god, how did you predict that?

2264
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:36,960
Here he is!

2265
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,460
He's not gonna say it though.

2266
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:41,800
Nevermind.

2267
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,820
I posted it in a tweet.

2268
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,860
But I basically said, you're just gonna be getting a lot of this.

2269
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,780
And when the exciting stuff happens, it's fun.

2270
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,720
But it is a lot of this.

2271
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,360
Please get the menu.

2272
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,600
Please, can I get the menu?

2273
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,020
Can I please get the menu?

2274
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:10,640
Please...

2275
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,200
Actually, I'm gonna pay out.

2276
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,120
Oh wait, I'll do it after this.

2277
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:17,540
Pay out.

2278
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,100
If I...

2279
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,720
If I go to the menu now...

2280
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,200
Okay, let's try...

2281
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,840
Wait, what are we on?

2282
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,760
I think we're on...

2283
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,200
Okay, we're on normal mode.

2284
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,880
So let's try classic mode.

2285
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,140
Again.

2286
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,440
We tried it before.

2287
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,040
But let's try it again.

2288
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,600
I don't know, maybe it'll help a little bit.

2289
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,760
We had a lucky streak at the start.

2290
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,300
I know!

2291
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,780
It started so strong!

2292
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,940
You'd think that the game would just start to pity me at some point.

2293
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:57,920
Snow...

2294
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,400
You switched it to classic?

2295
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:02,820
Yeah, we were on...

2296
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,480
Oh, you were on classic.

2297
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:05,940
Oh, I was?

2298
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,220
We started on normal then moved to classic and then now on classic again.

2299
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,080
Oh, wait, so I should I should switch it to normal now.

2300
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,460
I should switch it to normal now.

2301
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,920
Sorry, I thought I was on classic.

2302
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:25,920
Or normal before.

2303
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,420
Try advance.

2304
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,320
What if it's so difficult?

2305
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:42,880
So this is why when some people have asked me, like when I say oh yeah, I have this Metal Gear patchy slot, people have asked me before like, have you beaten it?

2306
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,860
And I'm like, no!

2307
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,540
Because this this is what I get every time!

2308
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,240
This is what I'm dealing with!

2309
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,420
Hi, paramedic.

2310
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:59,960
Oh my god.

2311
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,940
Look at the curve.

2312
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,440
Oh, we're blue now.

2313
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,940
Okay, this is looking good.

2314
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:06,520
Right?

2315
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,820
This is all different.

2316
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,600
Well, not different, but oh!

2317
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,500
We got some bullets.

2318
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,400
Okay.

2319
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:12,860
This is looking different.

2320
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,600
This is looking good.

2321
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,060
You keep getting so close.

2322
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,780
I feel like it.

2323
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,100
This game hates me.

2324
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,860
Come on, please.

2325
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:30,830
What the?

2326
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:32,770
Yeah!

2327
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:33,410
Yeah!

2328
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,030
Oh my gosh.

2329
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:38,390
Oh my gosh.

2330
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,390
Okay.

2331
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,870
I don't remember what this is.

2332
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,650
And I can't read it.

2333
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:53,610
I can read it, but I don't know what the...

2334
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,960
what it means.

2335
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,080
Someone Nihongo Jozu more than me can read it?

2336
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,100
Someone help.

2337
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,420
Someone help.

2338
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,120
Pull out the translator.

2339
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,320
It's too blurry?

2340
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,160
Oh yeah, you probably can't even see it.

2341
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,360
Ha ha ha ha.

2342
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,880
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2343
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:21,460
It's so...

2344
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:23,080
Oh yeah, because it's highlighted?

2345
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:24,560
There you go.

2346
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:25,720
Ha ha ha ha.

2347
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,720
I hate kanji.

2348
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,160
Sorry.

2349
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:36,190
Ha ha ha ha.

2350
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,090
Navi custom?

2351
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,530
No, that's not the one.

2352
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:41,630
Ha ha ha ha.

2353
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:47,550
Kanji is the enemy.

2354
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:49,130
It's still too... wait, no.

2355
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:50,370
Someone... that's it.

2356
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:55,880
I'm just gonna...

2357
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,400
Jozu!

2358
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,930
Try plugging your controller into the second slot.

2359
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,880
Okay, so is it read how I thought it would be read?

2360
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,280
But I don't understand what it means.

2361
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,520
Okay, I'm just gonna try clicking it.

2362
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,040
Oh my gosh.

2363
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,940
Oh, I clicked the exit button.

2364
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,240
Wait, okay.

2365
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:26,780
Oh!

2366
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,140
Oh!

2367
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,080
That's right.

2368
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,020
Yes.

2369
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:39,460
It shows you the different... okay, so if you get any of these combinations, you get to try again.

2370
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,620
And if you...

2371
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:47,240
I don't understand what the seven or three... like, they've been...

2372
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:51,500
I don't really understand what they mean.

2373
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,440
Like, I guess maybe credits?

2374
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,000
I don't really get it.

2375
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:56,840
I have no idea.

2376
01:36:58,680 --> 01:36:59,440
The odds?

2377
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,020
Yeah, but like, I don't know.

2378
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:02,720
Um...

2379
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,180
Multipliers.

2380
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,360
Oh, maybe.

2381
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,080
Maybe, maybe.

2382
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,540
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

2383
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:19,380
Okay.

2384
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,520
All right.

2385
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,260
Okay.

2386
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,780
Oh, we're in the underground this time!

2387
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,200
Okay.

2388
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,320
Oh.

2389
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:30,560
Hahahaha.

2390
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2391
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,220
Yeah, just your imagination.

2392
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,840
Just your imagination.

2393
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2394
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:41,800
You were wrong.

2395
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,800
Nothing here, nothing here.

2396
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:43,460
You were wrong.

2397
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:48,630
Are you kidding me?

2398
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:49,970
Hahahaha.

2399
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:54,330
This is...

2400
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:56,730
This is...

2401
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:56,750
This is...

2402
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:57,270
This is so cruel.

2403
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,310
This is...

2404
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:05,250
This is...

2405
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:05,730
This is...

2406
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,250
This is...

2407
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:06,870
This is painful.

2408
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:09,210
This is painful.

2409
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,130
Why are you guys even watching this?

2410
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:15,390
Why are you watching my pain and my suffering and my losing?

2411
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,550
...

2412
01:38:18,190 --> 01:38:18,630
...

2413
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:23,890
...

2414
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:24,830
We like pain.

2415
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:25,950
We like pain.

2416
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,250
What is this?

2417
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,850
What is this?

2418
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:31,370
...

2419
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:38,610
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and never changing.

2420
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:39,590
...

2421
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:41,770
No!

2422
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,810
...

2423
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:47,350
I am a symptom of evil!

2424
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,990
Nanda kore wa imou?

2425
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:55,430
That's not even the right quote.

2426
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:56,190
Whatever!

2427
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,770
It doesn't matter!

2428
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,690
Isn't this supposed to be pay to win?

2429
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,090
Oh, hi snake.

2430
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:06,050
He looks so cool.

2431
01:39:07,430 --> 01:39:08,750
Nanda kore wa?

2432
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:13,650
Isn't this supposed to be pay to win?

2433
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:18,150
Hornet Strike!

2434
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,530
Very cool.

2435
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,530
Yeah, take him out.

2436
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:31,090
Okay.

2437
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:34,630
Oh, never mind.

2438
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:36,590
We got demoted.

2439
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:39,610
Okay guys.

2440
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:40,930
Cigar.

2441
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:41,970
Cigar.

2442
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,970
Cigar.

2443
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:43,870
Cigar.

2444
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:44,670
Cigar.

2445
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:45,870
Cigar.

2446
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:46,370
Cigar.

2447
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:46,890
Cigar.

2448
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,270
Get forked.

2449
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,470
Fork!

2450
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:54,670
Fork!

2451
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:56,930
Fork!

2452
01:39:58,330 --> 01:39:59,730
Oh!

2453
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:04,910
We're red now and I don't know why.

2454
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,730
Doesn't even matter how hard you try.

2455
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:09,090
Okay.

2456
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:11,570
Okay.

2457
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:12,030
Okay.

2458
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,470
Maybe the game feels bad for me now.

2459
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:15,950
We're back in the underground.

2460
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,030
Our camouflage is 30% which is not great.

2461
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:26,510
Thank you for the dono.

2462
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:33,550
The greatest engineer of the USSR's nascent space age looking at his own blueprints.

2463
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,350
That's what I'm saying.

2464
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:37,350
It's your... they're your papers.

2465
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:37,770
Why?

2466
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,930
Why do you not know what it is?

2467
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:42,710
Okay.

2468
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:43,230
Alright.

2469
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:43,650
Come on.

2470
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,770
Come on.

2471
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:47,590
Please.

2472
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:48,110
What?!

2473
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,630
But I got three in a row!

2474
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:02,810
.

2475
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:07,690
.

2476
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:16,790
If you're a ghost in your pain, does that make it the phantom pain?

2477
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:19,070
Yes!

2478
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:21,910
Literally rigged.

2479
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:23,590
Oh my god.

2480
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:24,510
This is me.

2481
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:29,850
Can you... I kind of want to see him like in the family guy dead pose.

2482
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,250
Game.

2483
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:40,590
It's rigged.

2484
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,090
I know.

2485
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:43,870
What?

2486
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:46,330
I've never seen that before.

2487
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:47,050
What?

2488
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:49,110
What?

2489
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,770
Why did that guy just fly across the screen?

2490
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,530
I don't know.

2491
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:56,910
What happened?

2492
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,050
Okay.

2493
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:58,630
Wait.

2494
01:41:58,690 --> 01:41:58,910
What?

2495
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:01,610
One of those annoying guys.

2496
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:01,990
Yeah.

2497
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,330
Get forked.

2498
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:11,250
This game is so rigged.

2499
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:15,530
This game is so rigged.

2500
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:18,730
Nice.

2501
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:21,870
Okay.

2502
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:24,190
That's closer to the family guy pose.

2503
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:26,210
Fork and bite.

2504
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:30,170
Oh.

2505
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:33,810
We're progressing maybe.

2506
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,530
Where's the jackpot?

2507
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:37,490
I don't know.

2508
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:38,590
I don't know.

2509
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:39,950
I don't know.

2510
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,370
I don't know.

2511
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,930
I don't know anything anymore.

2512
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:46,390
I don't know.

2513
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,960
What was that?

2514
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,580
I've never had that before either.

2515
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,980
What is going on?

2516
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,320
Behind me.

2517
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,120
I was so shocked he said something else I don't even know what he said.

2518
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:21,300
Oh

2519
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,260
my god.

2520
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,220
We can finally progress.

2521
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,780
He actually remembered.

2522
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,360
The progress is none.

2523
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:36,820
Okay.

2524
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:37,920
50% camouflage.

2525
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:39,700
Okay.

2526
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:40,320
Alright.

2527
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:41,660
Okay.

2528
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:43,960
Okay.

2529
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
It's 50-50 chance you guys.

2530
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,400
And honestly.

2531
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,080
I'll be honest.

2532
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,860
50-50 is never on my side.

2533
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,700
Please.

2534
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,080
Please.

2535
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:01,400
Please.

2536
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,080
I just...

2537
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:03,940
Okay.

2538
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:04,380
Nice.

2539
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:05,740
Thank you for the donut!

2540
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,180
Thanks for sharing your brain rot with us.

2541
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:08,740
Thank you!

2542
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:11,600
Okay.

2543
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:13,960
Come on.

2544
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:16,580
What?

2545
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:16,880
What?

2546
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:17,140
What?

2547
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:17,460
What?

2548
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,440
Oh my god!

2549
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,700
Oh my god!

2550
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,640
What's going on?

2551
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,540
Oh push!

2552
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,180
Oh shit!

2553
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:44,740
I missed it!

2554
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,500
Sorry.

2555
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,160
I didn't mean to curse.

2556
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:46,840
No!

2557
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,180
That was too close.

2558
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:48,860
I was too slow!

2559
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:49,860
Okay.

2560
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,940
I have to look at this machine.

2561
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:52,680
I can't look at it.

2562
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,540
There's a slight delay when I look at it through the computer.

2563
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:57,240
So.

2564
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,500
Okay.

2565
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:58,800
Goodbye.

2566
01:44:58,980 --> 01:44:59,360
Alright.

2567
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:01,140
Come on.

2568
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:01,900
Come on.

2569
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:02,820
Come on!

2570
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,260
Oh god.

2571
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,740
There's a timer here.

2572
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,120
Five.

2573
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:06,740
Five.

2574
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:09,040
It says last game down there.

2575
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:13,220
Do something!

2576
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:14,200
Oh.

2577
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:16,880
Yeah!

2578
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:20,640
Oh my god.

2579
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:20,840
Oh my god.

2580
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:21,200
Oh my god.

2581
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:21,640
Oh my god.

2582
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,280
Nice!

2583
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:23,340
Nice!

2584
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,360
Nice!

2585
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,260
Push!

2586
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:25,480
Push!

2587
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:26,720
Oh dang.

2588
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:27,700
Dang dang dang.

2589
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,020
Okay.

2590
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:28,340
Okay.

2591
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,760
We only have two tries left though.

2592
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:33,340
One more?

2593
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:34,340
Uh oh.

2594
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,520
One more?

2595
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:38,900
Oh no.

2596
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:39,520
One!

2597
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,220
Two!

2598
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:40,940
Three!

2599
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:41,920
Push!

2600
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,300
I did it!

2601
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:45,940
Uh oh.

2602
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:55,050
Suddenly we're back here.

2603
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:57,290
What just happened?

2604
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:59,510
What?

2605
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,490
The cliffhanger.

2606
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:06,150
What just happened?

2607
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:12,250
I think maybe we lost because because we didn't get the helicopter.

2608
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,290
This is the Metal Gear experience I remember.

2609
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,850
Hope you have a good time.

2610
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:18,950
Thank you.

2611
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:29,650
What is this?

2612
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,270
The jungle.

2613
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,750
The jungle.

2614
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,150
In the jungle.

2615
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:46,330
Our jungle.

2616
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:50,370
I'm gonna die and sleep tonight.

2617
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:54,730
It's the colonel.

2618
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,910
I mean not the colonel.

2619
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:56,350
It's the Major.

2620
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:58,070
It's Wait.

2621
01:46:58,270 --> 01:46:59,790
Down here it turned to the Major.

2622
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,290
Instead of Snake.

2623
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:03,530
Why?

2624
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,050
Wait.

2625
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,810
I'm so confused.

2626
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:07,270
Oh!

2627
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,010
Exclamation point.

2628
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:15,250
Something is going on.

2629
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:16,750
What is going on?

2630
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:17,610
What?

2631
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:18,290
Me too.

2632
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:19,310
I don't know.

2633
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:19,870
What is this?

2634
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:27,470
Ch-ch-chance!

2635
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:31,970
Okay.

2636
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:32,730
Thank you.

2637
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:34,610
Oh.

2638
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:34,950
Okay.

2639
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:38,490
Wait.

2640
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:38,790
What?

2641
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,910
What?

2642
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:39,590
What's going on?

2643
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:41,070
What's going on?

2644
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:41,710
What's going on?

2645
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:42,350
Oh my god.

2646
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:42,530
Please.

2647
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:43,290
What's going on?

2648
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:43,990
What?

2649
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:45,330
What's going on?

2650
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:45,930
You guys.

2651
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:46,490
What's going on?

2652
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:48,890
No.

2653
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:49,210
Please.

2654
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,270
What happened?

2655
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,790
No!

2656
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,480
Everything is happening all at once.

2657
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,600
I'm so...

2658
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:19,280
In the jungle The mighty jungle The mighty jungle The lion sleeps The lion sleeps tonight The lion sleeps tonight The lion sleeps tonight 5,

2659
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:30,840
6, 7, 0, 9 5, 6, 7, 0, 9 5, 6, 7, 0, 9

2660
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,700
Let's go.

2661
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,260
Okay.

2662
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,640
The escape!

2663
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:39,400
Okay.

2664
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,480
I think we can do this one though.

2665
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,560
We don't need camouflage.

2666
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:43,580
Right?

2667
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,100
We're running for our lives.

2668
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:46,640
We don't need camouflage.

2669
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:46,640
Right?

2670
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:46,640
We're running for our lives.

2671
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:47,280
Okay.

2672
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:47,720
Chance.

2673
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,240
Chance.

2674
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:48,800
Chance.

2675
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,060
Chance!

2676
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,220
Nice.

2677
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:51,880
Stupid dogs.

2678
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,460
Bow wow!

2679
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:57,990
That's a lot.

2680
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:00,510
If you loved me, you'd let me go.

2681
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:03,170
If you loved me, you'd let me go.

2682
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:03,590
Oh.

2683
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:04,270
Again?

2684
01:49:04,690 --> 01:49:05,490
Okay guys.

2685
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:06,790
Let's survive this time.

2686
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:07,130
Okay.

2687
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:09,670
Yeah!

2688
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:10,990
In

2689
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,100
the wrong order on accident.

2690
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:20,540
Two.

2691
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,020
Thank you!

2692
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:22,540
Oh.

2693
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,020
Okay.

2694
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,040
Nice!

2695
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,000
Nice!

2696
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:27,240
Nice!

2697
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:27,600
Nice!

2698
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:32,340
Yeah!

2699
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:32,800
Yeah!

2700
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:32,980
Yeah!

2701
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:33,260
Okay.

2702
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:33,720
Okay.

2703
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:39,790
Okay.

2704
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:40,330
It's okay.

2705
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,230
We got three chances, I guess.

2706
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:42,690
For the...

2707
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,890
For the helicopter.

2708
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:46,030
Okay.

2709
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:47,710
I'm sweating.

2710
01:49:47,970 --> 01:49:48,550
I'm sweating.

2711
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:48,950
I'm sweating.

2712
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:49,310
I'm sweating.

2713
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,770
Nice!

2714
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:55,470
Yes!

2715
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:55,630
Yes!

2716
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:55,830
Yes!

2717
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,070
This big snake!

2718
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:02,750
Come on!

2719
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:04,850
Come on!

2720
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:07,170
Oh!

2721
01:50:08,210 --> 01:50:09,390
She's coming.

2722
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:11,690
Come

2723
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:17,010
on.

2724
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:17,770
Come on!

2725
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:25,180
Come on!

2726
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,540
Come on!

2727
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,260
Oh.

2728
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:30,940
Okay.

2729
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,240
One more.

2730
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,410
I can't do anything!

2731
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:01,290
I can't!

2732
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:03,130
NO!

2733
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:04,130
THERE IS A PROBLEM!

2734
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:04,670
YOU'RE STICK!

2735
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:05,170
PLEASE!

2736
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,010
WE NEED TO...

2737
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:16,530
This game is hard.

2738
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:17,030
I know.

2739
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:20,030
It really is like so tough.

2740
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:23,150
When I try to describe to people like...

2741
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:28,710
When I try to describe to people like... it is not easy!

2742
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:30,310
Get it?

2743
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:31,430
Maybe it's just me.

2744
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:32,350
I have no idea.

2745
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:33,550
We're stuck in a loop.

2746
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:42,070
Are you going to eat?

2747
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:42,830
Are you going to eat?

2748
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,670
Oh, Snake thinks about his food.

2749
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:48,110
Oh, a grenade!

2750
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:53,750
Oh my gosh, we're actually getting stuff though.

2751
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:54,830
This is good, right?

2752
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:57,070
Oh no, not the progress, please.

2753
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:58,250
Oh, please.

2754
01:51:58,570 --> 01:51:59,250
Oh no.

2755
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:08,020
I don't even know what's happening.

2756
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:08,640
Me neither!

2757
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:10,500
Nice!

2758
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,760
I'm going to become the Joker.

2759
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,260
I'm going to become the Joker.

2760
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,680
I think the game is actually feeling bad for me.

2761
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,860
I think the game is actually starting to pity me a little bit.

2762
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,840
No more progress.

2763
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:03,940
90%?

2764
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:05,640
Nice!

2765
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:10,680
Oh, nice.

2766
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,000
Okay.

2767
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:15,300
We live in Apache's... Apache's society.

2768
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:23,310
Oh!

2769
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,030
I've never seen this guy before.

2770
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:31,030
Am I in Fortnite emoting?

2771
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:31,570
Wait!

2772
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:32,390
What is this?

2773
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:33,310
Stop.

2774
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:36,990
Oh my god!

2775
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,010
Here it is!

2776
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:40,550
Yes!

2777
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:41,950
Oh my god!

2778
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:43,070
Bonus!

2779
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:45,830
Please, please, let me get big boss.

2780
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,230
Please, please, please, please, please.

2781
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:50,590
Oh my god, please, please, please, please, please.

2782
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:53,130
Oh my god, bonus, bonus!

2783
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,730
Let's go!

2784
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:01,240
This is what it looks like?

2785
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,700
This is so awesome, right?

2786
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,300
Come on, come on, come on.

2787
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:10,800
What is this?

2788
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:11,800
Okay.

2789
01:54:16,630 --> 01:54:17,030
Good.

2790
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:18,550
What is this?

2791
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:21,250
Good.

2792
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:22,590
Come on, give us the great.

2793
01:54:25,330 --> 01:54:26,710
Oh, oh, oh, please.

2794
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:28,190
Oh god, oh god.

2795
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:28,430
Okay.

2796
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:30,270
No.

2797
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:32,770
I see it.

2798
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:33,690
I see it in there.

2799
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:34,650
I see it in there.

2800
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,540
Regular bonus!

2801
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:57,580
Oh!

2802
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,220
Oh my god, look at the intros and stuff.

2803
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,400
Isn't it so awesome?

2804
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:07,910
Thank you, Eva.

2805
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,650
See, she just looks a little off.

2806
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:11,950
I don't know what it is.

2807
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,430
It's just something.

2808
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:28,450
The new eyebrows?

2809
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:29,570
Maybe that's it.

2810
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:30,670
Maybe that's it.

2811
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:31,370
Maybe.

2812
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:36,550
Oh, major zero.

2813
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:39,810
His neck here is insane.

2814
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:43,310
But he looks awesome here.

2815
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:57,440
Here, I'll shut up a little bit so you guys can hear the audio a little better.

2816
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:00,180
What neck?

2817
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:00,860
I don't know.

2818
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:06,440
The Jinju dirty in major zero.

2819
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,480
Oh my god, what he says.

2820
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,280
He said to the... I felt that.

2821
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:16,720
No!

2822
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,670
Remember the basis of CQC?

2823
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:30,770
I punched the slot machine as strong as ghost.

2824
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:31,510
Thank you!

2825
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:39,670
Thank you, Acelot.

2826
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:41,310
Thank you, Acelot.

2827
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:43,610
Thank you, Acelot.

2828
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:45,350
I'm making like little intros of everybody.

2829
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:52,670
I love.

2830
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:56,370
I love the N's Japanese voice.

2831
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:57,470
I love it so much.

2832
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:01,210
He just sounds like the perfect old man.

2833
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:04,250
He looks so good.

2834
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:04,930
Oh my gosh.

2835
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:08,430
I've never actually have seen his models so much.

2836
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:11,090
His hair looks like an actual...

2837
01:57:11,090 --> 01:57:13,190
He looks like a scarecrow.

2838
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,250
It's so stringy.

2839
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:20,610
Sorry if the quality is kind of bad right now because it's so much flashing.

2840
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:27,570
Where is my gay cat boy son?

2841
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:28,710
Patience.

2842
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:30,230
Hopefully he comes home, actually.

2843
01:57:31,330 --> 01:57:33,010
Because these are random, too.

2844
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:34,370
You don't always get the same characters.

2845
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,240
He looks so cool!

2846
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,520
He looks so good!

2847
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,080
Oh, his eyes!

2848
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,600
Oh my god, he looks so high.

2849
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,140
I can't wait for Delta.

2850
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,320
This bonus version music of the MGS3 is groovy.

2851
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,260
Yeah, it's cool.

2852
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,940
I love bonus time!

2853
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:11,440
I've had this

2854
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:15,760
one before.

2855
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,940
Oh my god, he looks so good!

2856
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:24,080
Oh my god, he looks so good!

2857
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,100
Oh my god!

2858
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:28,220
Oh my god!

2859
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:29,960
Oh my god, sorry.

2860
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,900
Oh my god, oh my god.

2861
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:35,340
Nice!

2862
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:35,940
Maybe...

2863
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:37,680
Oh my god, sorry.

2864
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:38,700
I was so...

2865
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:40,760
He looks so good!

2866
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:48,400
Oh my god, oh my god!

2867
01:58:58,210 --> 01:58:59,770
We got it, you guys!

2868
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00,490
We got it!

2869
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:19,630
It only took... two hours!

2870
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:21,270
Oh my god.

2871
01:59:25,490 --> 01:59:26,890
Oh my god.

2872
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:29,650
I'm gonna go a little slower so it plays as much as possible.

2873
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:30,510
Oh my god.

2874
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,350
But he never was.

2875
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:34,750
But he never was.

2876
01:59:36,290 --> 01:59:36,890
But he never was.

2877
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:37,670
He never was.

2878
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,250
But he never was.

2879
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:42,250
Oh

2880
01:59:45,540 --> 02:00:02,740
my god, he looks so good.

2881
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,980
I can't wait for Oh my god.

2882
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:08,220
This is exactly why I bought this machine.

2883
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:10,600
Oh, I love it.

2884
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:16,760
Oh, the walking with the switch between the scenes.

2885
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:17,760
It's so good.

2886
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,880
Oh, man.

2887
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:31,400
Sorry, I'm not even looking at chat.

2888
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:33,320
I just can't stop looking.

2889
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,860
You look so goofy.

2890
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:43,900
Oh, she looks so perfect.

2891
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,460
Oh my god.

2892
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:48,280
Oh gosh, she looks so perfect.

2893
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:53,700
Oh my gosh, she looks so good.

2894
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,220
Tense!

2895
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:10,320
Rank up!

2896
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:11,660
I don't know what that means.

2897
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,670
Rykoff looks so cool too.

2898
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:32,650
Oh, she looks good there.

2899
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:40,570
And then I have to repeat so that you can get all the... hopefully see all the scenes, you know?

2900
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:44,030
It's just... it looks so good.

2901
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:45,310
It looks too good!

2902
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,770
Oh, it looks too good.

2903
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:48,530
Wait, I think this is a repeat now, so yeah.

2904
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:49,690
Okay.

2905
02:01:50,230 --> 02:01:51,410
Alright, so we got everything.

2906
02:01:53,370 --> 02:01:55,430
Wait, it says last game 46.

2907
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:56,430
No way.

2908
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:00,090
Oh my god, we have 45 more turns?

2909
02:02:04,730 --> 02:02:05,130
Yeah!

2910
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:05,870
You know what?

2911
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:09,110
It took us this... it took us this hard to get here.

2912
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:12,350
We can watch it as many times as we want.

2913
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:17,470
But I have to do this patchy slot part or else it doesn't continue.

2914
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:21,550
It'll end up like... the music will end up fading.

2915
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:25,070
It was worth it.

2916
02:02:29,070 --> 02:02:30,990
Rykoff looks so cute.

2917
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:33,110
He looks so cute.

2918
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:35,430
Oh, what are we getting it?

2919
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:37,550
Mystery!

2920
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:40,650
Truly the big bonus.

2921
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:42,590
There is one other mode.

2922
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:46,110
Like, this is the theater one, but there's one other one.

2923
02:02:46,270 --> 02:02:47,330
I can't remember what it's called.

2924
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:51,630
The day you go through the rain.

2925
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:57,370
It's a day... the... the... the... the bees.

2926
02:02:58,770 --> 02:02:59,770
I'm in it.

2927
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:00,890
I'm still in a dream.

2928
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:02,170
Snake Eater, yeah!

2929
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:02,250
Yeah!

2930
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:09,550
Oh, sorry.

2931
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:10,110
I know.

2932
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:10,510
Sorry.

2933
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:11,090
Here you go.

2934
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:11,770
You can see it.

2935
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:14,890
I shouldn't put my hand on the screen so you can...

2936
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:15,750
I'm like, look!

2937
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:17,690
Isn't my machine so beautiful?

2938
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:18,830
Isn't it so pretty?

2939
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:20,550
Aren't the cutscenes so nice?

2940
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:23,170
With my hand, like, blocking everything.

2941
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:29,290
Oh, Snake looks so awesome.

2942
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:32,330
Oh!

2943
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:35,810
Mystery!

2944
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:41,430
Oh!

2945
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,160
Nice.

2946
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:45,960
Oh!

2947
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,500
Oh!

2948
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:46,840
Oh!

2949
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,080
Oh!

2950
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:47,120
Oh!

2951
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:50,200
Come on!

2952
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:51,240
Come on!

2953
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:55,120
Come on!

2954
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:55,620
Shoot!

2955
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,100
Dang.

2956
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:08,890
Oh, I'm so glad we got this.

2957
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:11,310
Oh, I'm so glad we got this.

2958
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:11,550
Oh, I'm so glad we got this.

2959
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:12,390
Oh,

2960
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:15,560
I'm so glad we got this.

2961
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:15,820
Oh, I'm so glad we got this.

2962
02:04:15,820 --> 02:04:15,940
Two!

2963
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:17,340
Thank you!

2964
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:20,580
You have surpassed even the bonus.

2965
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:23,620
We award you the title, Big Bonus.

2966
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:24,800
I know!

2967
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:27,580
The Big Bonus came out of nowhere, you guys!

2968
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:31,460
We had regular bonus, and then they awarded us Big Bonus!

2969
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,240
Maybe the game loves us after all.

2970
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:38,940
I feel like if we weren't watching you...

2971
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:41,380
watching, you would smooch the screen.

2972
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:42,420
Which is okay.

2973
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:43,060
I would too.

2974
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:46,320
Yeah, maybe.

2975
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:47,940
Maybe.

2976
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:52,540
Oh!

2977
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:53,480
I'm sorry.

2978
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:55,080
I can't get over how cute Rykov looks.

2979
02:04:57,480 --> 02:05:00,440
Like, if there was a... good remake.

2980
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:01,140
Not a good one.

2981
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:04,080
Well, if there was a... like a new...

2982
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:08,040
rather, a remake of MGS2, I guess.

2983
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,700
Would Ryden look like that?

2984
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,580
He'd be so cute!

2985
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:17,440
Yeah, like a Delta remake.

2986
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:20,300
Not that I... oh, oops.

2987
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:21,240
Sorry, Ocelot.

2988
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:21,960
I wasn't paying attention.

2989
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:25,360
Um, not that I want that, but...

2990
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:29,080
it's fun to see how, um, Ryden would maybe look.

2991
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:46,450
Okay, we only have 16 left.

2992
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:49,890
Look at our total get!

2993
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,470
It's so small!

2994
02:05:53,410 --> 02:05:53,950
Come

2995
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:09,500
on, big bucks!

2996
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:14,140
Come on, big, big bonus!

2997
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,540
Big money!

2998
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:19,180
Now!

2999
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:24,120
Click the link for money!

3000
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:26,640
Oh!

3001
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,220
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3002
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,640
Now you can see, like, the close-up of it.

3003
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:32,140
It's very good.

3004
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,660
The art is so awesome.

3005
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:34,000
So, um...

3006
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:06,640
D sjaba-de.

3007
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:09,220
Everyone just... oh!

3008
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:09,500
Oh!

3009
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,540
Last 3 games.

3010
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:11,820
Okay!

3011
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:21,390
Okay.

3012
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:22,690
Uh.

3013
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:38,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay!

3014
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:38,720
Two more, two more.

3015
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,240
Okay.

3016
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:44,340
You go through the rain, ba-bam.

3017
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:44,720
Oh!

3018
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Double snake dream.

3019
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:49,180
On a trip, ba-da, ba-ba.

3020
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,360
Oh, a different seven.

3021
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,900
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba.

3022
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,140
Last one, Kim.

3023
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:12,590
I get a 140!

3024
02:08:13,070 --> 02:08:13,490
Whoosh!

3025
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:15,430
Snake it up!

3026
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:33,820
And... oh, here it is.

3027
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:34,560
Okay, here we go.

3028
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:40,080
You can see it's the whole thing.

3029
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,900
It looks so good.

3030
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:59,160
It looks so good.

3031
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,000
It just looks so good.

3032
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:21,960
The thing is, he doesn't flip here.

3033
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,260
It's actually quite disappointing.

3034
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:24,880
But it looks so good.

3035
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,340
Oh my god, it looks so good.

3036
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,620
I have to keep going real simple.

3037
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:34,280
It looks... oh my god, it looks... oh god, it looks incredible.

3038
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:36,360
It looks... it looks way too good.

3039
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:41,640
Like, it almost looks like it's not a game.

3040
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:43,540
It almost looks like real footage sometimes.

3041
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:44,580
Like, it's kind of scary.

3042
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,200
The graphics on a slap machine.

3043
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:50,960
I know, right?

3044
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:52,120
It's crazy.

3045
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,680
It looks so good though.

3046
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:59,220
I think I have to keep going or else...

3047
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,920
He's just gonna fall forever.

3048
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:06,600
Okay, alright, Snake.

3049
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:08,440
Don't flip!

3050
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,820
You won't!

3051
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:14,840
Good!

3052
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:19,590
He's just... he's just...

3053
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:21,810
He's free falling!

3054
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:23,930
He's going forever.

3055
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:26,230
He's... he's... he's...

3056
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:27,850
Okay, Snake.

3057
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:30,590
How... how big is the atmosphere?

3058
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:34,750
He's just still going.

3059
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:37,430
He's...

3060
02:10:38,970 --> 02:10:40,210
Okay, Snake.

3061
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:41,730
We get it.

3062
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:43,870
You can stop.

3063
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:47,750
Alright.

3064
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:50,030
Do something.

3065
02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:53,610
Pull the parachute.

3066
02:10:54,810 --> 02:10:55,190
Snake...

3067
02:10:57,930 --> 02:10:58,490
He's...

3068
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,490
he's going to fall forever.

3069
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,730
Oh my god!

3070
02:10:59,030 --> 02:11:00,190
Snake, please!

3071
02:11:00,870 --> 02:11:01,430
Snake...

3072
02:11:05,730 --> 02:11:06,290
Oh!

3073
02:11:06,970 --> 02:11:07,270
Oh!

3074
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:07,470
Oh!

3075
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:08,170
Okay, we need this one!

3076
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:10,650
Fox is still hunted.

3077
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:11,350
Fox is still hunted.

3078
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:12,870
Fox is not still hunted.

3079
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:26,560
Oh!

3080
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:29,100
Sorry, I didn't...

3081
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:29,600
Oh my god!

3082
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:33,850
What...

3083
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:35,190
Let's go!

3084
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:36,710
He's gonna fall forever!

3085
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,150
Okay,

3086
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,570
move on!

3087
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:43,010
Oh, he's gonna...

3088
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:44,670
Oh my god!

3089
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:47,570
Time to fight, baby!

3090
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:58,030
Now you're going to see how truly evil... how truly evil... this Patchy Slot game is.

3091
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:06,890
You are going to see... how evil... this game is.

3092
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:07,750
Truly.

3093
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:08,770
Truly!

3094
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:10,990
Like... oh my god.

3095
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,410
Oh my god.

3096
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:13,730
I can't believe we're here.

3097
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:15,310
This is the best.

3098
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:18,550
And I'm glad it's Ocelot.

3099
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:27,710
Honestly, I do want to see the fury and I do want to see the end, but I'm glad for viewing that it's Ocelot, you know?

3100
02:12:29,190 --> 02:12:32,490
So you guys can see Ocelot nice and close in this whole scene and everything.

3101
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:45,770
All right.

3102
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:46,650
Oh my god.

3103
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:48,730
Okay guys, prepare to lose.

3104
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:50,970
To battle.

3105
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:53,550
Okay.

3106
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:55,930
So...

3107
02:13:00,750 --> 02:13:02,030
All right.

3108
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:05,030
He has three bars.

3109
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:07,630
Keep that in mind.

3110
02:13:07,970 --> 02:13:10,050
He has green, yellow, red.

3111
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:11,970
Okay.

3112
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:12,810
He has three.

3113
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:13,750
Three bars.

3114
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,220
The tumbleweed.

3115
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:24,320
Okay.

3116
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:28,380
Three bars.

3117
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:34,260
Nice!

3118
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:35,660
See how much damage that did?

3119
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:37,700
Do you see how much damage that did?

3120
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:38,360
Okay.

3121
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,240
Okay.

3122
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:40,640
Okay.

3123
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:41,360
Where are we?

3124
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:44,700
It did like, you know, like... you know.

3125
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:45,760
Okay.

3126
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:46,540
Three bars.

3127
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:48,020
Right?

3128
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:49,400
And that's how much damage?

3129
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:50,000
Okay.

3130
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:55,140
Oh, this is my life bar.

3131
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,260
I forgot to mention.

3132
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,060
I have four shots.

3133
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:03,520
So if he hits me four times, we start the whole game over.

3134
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,320
Okay?

3135
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,900
And he has three bars.

3136
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,800
Do you understand why now I've never beaten this game before?

3137
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:18,160
Do you understand?

3138
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,840
I've never beaten a boss battle.

3139
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:20,400
Ever.

3140
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:22,020
I don't think there's a way to heal.

3141
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:26,520
If there is, I have no idea what it is.

3142
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:28,400
If there's a way to heal.

3143
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:29,840
So, um...

3144
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:32,340
KERATINE!

3145
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:33,500
All right.

3146
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:35,880
Stun grenade.

3147
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:36,360
Not bad.

3148
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:37,680
Not bad.

3149
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:38,300
Advantage.

3150
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,100
Nice, nice, nice.

3151
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:44,640
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3152
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:46,780
Hmm...

3153
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:53,620
I think it would've been even better... Why is it even already?

3154
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,540
I think it would've been even better if we got the orange next.

3155
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:02,100
Why does Acelad's voice fit him so perfectly?

3156
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:02,940
Oh!

3157
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:03,680
Oh!

3158
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:04,440
Oh!

3159
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:06,020
Nice!

3160
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:06,880
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

3161
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:09,480
Rush, rush, rush, rush, rush.

3162
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:12,000
Rush, rush, rush.

3163
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:15,720
Rush, rush, rush, rush.

3164
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:19,020
Rush, rush, rush, rush.

3165
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,320
Okay, nice.

3166
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,240
Oh my god, wait.

3167
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:24,820
Rush.

3168
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:26,400
Rush, rush.

3169
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:28,760
We're back to even, okay.

3170
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:39,460
Okay, we're about a little under 50%, or rather a little over 50% for his health.

3171
02:15:41,060 --> 02:15:44,360
And we still don't have any hits on us, so that's a tumble win.

3172
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,600
It's not so bad.

3173
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:57,680
Nice, okay.

3174
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,460
Three tumble wins.

3175
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:04,760
Nothing's going on.

3176
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:05,860
Oh no, oh no, please.

3177
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:07,780
Also, I don't... look at him go!

3178
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:08,480
Look at him go!

3179
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,100
Oh my god!

3180
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:14,440
Uh oh, uh oh, okay.

3181
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,520
I don't know how to block attacks.

3182
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,240
So...

3183
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,960
Oh, oh god.

3184
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:25,440
Okay, that's one hit.

3185
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:30,820
Nice!

3186
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,180
250 over.

3187
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:34,180
What does that mean?

3188
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,500
I'm so tense right now.

3189
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:57,660
Truly the Dark Souls of slot machines.

3190
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:08,950
Good.

3191
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:10,390
Come

3192
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:19,820
on, Ocelot.

3193
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:20,560
Come on, Ocelot.

3194
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:23,420
Ghosts are proud creatures.

3195
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:30,260
Oh no, we didn't even attack him once!

3196
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:32,240
This game is so cruel.

3197
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,000
What's the strategy here?

3198
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:37,200
Uh...

3199
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:40,180
I wish I could just pay more money.

3200
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:44,200
Like, I don't know why it... why it, uh...

3201
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:51,240
I don't know why you can't, like, continue the fight.

3202
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:53,500
You know, why it has to take you back to the very beginning.

3203
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,700
Is the most painful part.

3204
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,140
But, I got to show you the scenes and we got to a boss fight.

3205
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:07,080
So I feel very fulfilled in what I was able to show you guys today.

3206
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:11,580
Even though it took two hours to get there.

3207
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:25,480
Uggggggggggggggg.

3208
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:26,440
Ugh.

3209
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:36,080
Ocelot?

3210
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:36,720
Ocelot?

3211
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:39,720
I don't think there's a way to avoid the attacks.

3212
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:41,260
Please,

3213
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:47,900
please, please!

3214
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,760
Please, please, please!

3215
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,120
Please!

3216
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:52,980
Guys, I think we're in trouble.

3217
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:56,240
I think we're in trouble.

3218
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:01,720
Nice!

3219
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:02,180
Ooh!

3220
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,600
Yes!

3221
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,640
Big damage.

3222
02:19:06,890 --> 02:19:07,880
Big damage.

3223
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:09,740
Spin to win.

3224
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:12,940
Ooh.

3225
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:15,080
Oh!

3226
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:18,100
Nice!

3227
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:20,380
It's looking good!

3228
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:30,960
Oh my god.

3229
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,860
I don't, I don't even know if I've ever gotten this far before.

3230
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:37,200
No second.

3231
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,220
I am not daijoubu.

3232
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:38,640
Please.

3233
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:43,080
I'm, I'm, I'm literally losing my vision.

3234
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:43,920
I'm going unconscious.

3235
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:47,580
I'm... I think I'm... I think this is it for me.

3236
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:50,880
Yah!

3237
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,900
Does money heal you?

3238
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:54,280
No!

3239
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,900
I have max credits!

3240
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:58,540
Uh oh.

3241
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,260
Uh oh.

3242
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,960
I'm not gonna turn into the Sorrow.

3243
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:10,160
I'm gonna turn into the Joker.

3244
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:15,100
Snake

3245
02:20:18,870 --> 02:20:19,370
dies.

3246
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,870
Cause I'm already dead.

3247
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:24,190
Your money has no power here.

3248
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:25,530
Yeah.

3249
02:20:25,650 --> 02:20:26,390
Oh no.

3250
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:26,990
Oh no.

3251
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:29,930
Oh, I think it's over, you guys!

3252
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:30,930
I think this is it!

3253
02:20:32,530 --> 02:20:33,610
Everybody say...

3254
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:35,650
Sayonara.

3255
02:20:43,650 --> 02:20:46,050
You can see Snake's face in slow-mo.

3256
02:20:46,770 --> 02:20:47,570
Never mind.

3257
02:20:48,970 --> 02:20:49,510
Ah.

3258
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:53,730
Real footage of...

3259
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:54,170
Real footage of...

3260
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,530
Mint phantom gameplay.

3261
02:20:56,830 --> 02:20:58,130
Milk your solid gameplay.

3262
02:20:58,590 --> 02:20:59,130
Hahaha.

3263
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:02,750
Ah.

3264
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:05,510
Thanks, Ocelot.

3265
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:08,150
Wait, continue zone.

3266
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:09,870
Save?

3267
02:21:12,150 --> 02:21:13,010
Wait, what?

3268
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:15,290
What do you mean?

3269
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:16,050
Woah!

3270
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:19,170
Woah, that's crazy!

3271
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:20,210
Wait, what do you mean save?

3272
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:23,930
Oh, and also we're... we have our little... the little...

3273
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,150
Woah, that's crazy!

02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,150
Wait, what do you mean save?

3275
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,510
Oh, and also we're...

3276
02:21:24,510 --> 02:21:24,510

3277
02:21:24,510 --> 02:21:24,510

Oh, and also we're... we have our little...

Oh, and also we're... we have our little...

3286
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:33,690

Oh, and also we're... we have our little... um...

02:21:34,250 --> 02:21:34,450
Oh, and also we're... we have our little... um...

02:21:34,450 --> 02:21:34,590
Oh, and also we're...

Oh, and also we're... we have our little...

3293
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:34,610

Oh,

02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:51,330
and also we're... we have our little... um...

3298
02:21:51,330 --> 02:21:51,990
Ready?

3299
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:55,210
Say it with me!

3300
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:58,710
Get... full!

3301
02:22:00,390 --> 02:22:00,850
Rationed!

3302
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:13,770
Get... rationed!

3303
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:17,850
Four big bonus.

3304
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:18,910
Why are we still here?

3305
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:19,630
Just to suffer.

3306
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:21,750
Every night I can feel my fork in my cigar.

3307
02:22:21,970 --> 02:22:22,930
Even my bullets.

3308
02:22:22,930 --> 02:22:24,390
The progress I've lost.

3309
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:25,630
The hours I've lost.

3310
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:26,430
Won't stop.

3311
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:27,810
Nanda kore wae.

3312
02:22:27,850 --> 02:22:28,730
Big bonus.

3313
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:29,430
What a thrill!

3314
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:34,370
Ocelot, why are we still here?

3315
02:22:35,530 --> 02:22:36,470
Oh, we got it!

3316
02:22:36,470 --> 02:22:36,650
Okay!

3317
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:37,990
Everybody say it with me!

3318
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:38,910
Sorry.

3319
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:42,410
I instinctively pushed it very quickly.

3320
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:47,090
Sorry.

3321
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:52,230
Gosh, Ocelot is just hand-holding the whole time.

3322
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:54,590
He won't let me impress how I want to.

3323
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:56,470
He's like, come on!

3324
02:22:56,490 --> 02:22:57,530
Migi da manaka!

3325
02:22:58,630 --> 02:22:59,490
You know?

3326
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:02,750
Oh, Eva!

3327
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:06,370
Oh, never mind.

3328
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:07,330
Eva does not respond.

3329
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:10,950
Yeah!

3330
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:14,710
Nanda kore wae.

3331
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:16,170
Nanda kore wae.

3332
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:18,230
Nanda kore

3333
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:24,120
wae.

3334
02:23:24,220 --> 02:23:26,780
It's time to get...

3335
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,320
Forked!

3336
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:29,060
Yeah!

3337
02:23:30,580 --> 02:23:34,240
And with that, everybody, I think...

3338
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,520
I think that is all of...

3339
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:39,500
the...

3340
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:42,160
Metal Gear Apache slot.

3341
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:48,020
I'm going to keep chatting after this because I don't want to end just quite yet.

3342
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,820
What do you guys think?

3343
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:55,740
What if...

3344
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:56,980
What if...

3345
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:00,540
What did you guys think?

3346
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:05,280
I have no idea what's happening, but my brain likes the sounds and colors.

3347
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:06,100
Cool machining.

3348
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:06,740
Thanks!

3349
02:24:07,420 --> 02:24:09,000
An interesting concept.

3350
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:10,260
I think...

3351
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:11,520
having...

3352
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,060
a battle through...

3353
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:16,500
slots is...

3354
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:20,700
actually something only the Devil could conjure up.

3355
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:23,120
I think it is so evil.

3356
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:25,580
Um...

3357
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:29,600
But other than that, I do like watching Ocelot spin his guns.

3358
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,360
I understood nothing.

3359
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:36,500
You know what?

3360
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,620
Yeah, you could watch this and be like...

3361
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:41,100
This is...

3362
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:42,640
the...

3363
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,620
the most...

3364
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:44,440
Oh my god.

3365
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,160
Nanda kore wae.

3366
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:49,580
This is a truly...

3367
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,440
This is Metal Gear Solid 3.

3368
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,480
I don't understand anything that's going on.

3369
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:56,600
Will you ever do another podcast?

3370
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,260
Cheers to Ocelot's dream.

3371
02:24:57,620 --> 02:24:59,960
I think...

3372
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:03,260
I think...

3373
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:04,980
it's...

3374
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:08,360
What's the word?

3375
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:13,320
I think it's going to be exactly the same as here.

3376
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:15,200
We may be...

3377
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,780
I mean there are some events that we haven't gotten before.

3378
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:19,920
I think it will be mostly...

3379
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:22,440
the same exact thing.

3380
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,600
Yeah, I'll have to check the difficulty later.

3381
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:27,580
For sure.

3382
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:37,440
About every two to three streams ended with a few games of Patchy Slot.

3383
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:43,120
See, that would be difficult because I had to move my Patchy Slot.

3384
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:46,560
My Patchy Slot is usually over there in my room.

3385
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:51,180
And I had to very painstakingly drag it closer to my computer.

3386
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:53,640
So that wouldn't really work out.

3387
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:56,180
Because... yeah.

3388
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:58,960
Oh, I can disable the echo mic.

3389
02:25:59,060 --> 02:25:59,240
You're right.

3390
02:25:59,300 --> 02:25:59,580
Thank you.

3391
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:03,520
There we go.

3392
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:09,620
So... how large is it?

3393
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:12,300
It's very large and very in charge.

3394
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:13,420
It's very heavy.

3395
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:14,100
Yeah, it's...

3396
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:16,920
Okay, so... let's see.

3397
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:19,140
This is my arm.

3398
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:20,940
And it...

3399
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:23,080
This is the top of the machine.

3400
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:26,740
And it doesn't even go to like the middle.

3401
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,000
And it's... it's...

3402
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,420
Hold on, let me measure how thick it is.

3403
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:32,260
Thick.

3404
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:37,320
Maybe... hold on.

3405
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:39,820
It's like this...

3406
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:41,540
This thick.

3407
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,200
Wait.

3408
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:48,180
It's like...

3409
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:53,200
You can't show these guns on YouTube.

3410
02:26:58,220 --> 02:27:00,100
It is kind of like a refrigerator.

3411
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:01,080
Yeah, it is.

3412
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:02,660
It does kind of feel like a refrigerator.

3413
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,300
This is cool though.

3414
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:06,840
I don't think I've ever seen this before.

3415
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:09,740
Or if I have, it was a long time ago.

3416
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:10,760
So...

3417
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:11,960
Yay.

3418
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:13,840
Yay.

3419
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:17,840
Yay.

3420
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,160
So...

3421
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:30,900
Let's see.

3422
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:31,440
I have this.

3423
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:43,760
And...

3424
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:43,780
I see...

3425
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:44,060
You've been wearing this.

3426
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:44,120
It's very nice.

3427
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:49,920
If I have to describe it...

3428
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:50,980
It's very similar to the most popular one.

3429
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:52,100
I will be wearing this.

3430
02:27:52,100 --> 02:28:02,160
Feels like... feels while trying to figure out what we all just watched since this is probably the most folks have seen of the patchy game.

3431
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:02,940
You think so?

3432
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:06,580
I don't know.

3433
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:11,220
I wish I could have shown it off better, but my luck tends to be poor.

3434
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:17,300
So I truly apologize, but it is quite fine.

3435
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:21,240
Like it's not something that I could typically sit...

3436
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:22,540
Well, that's not true.

3437
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,860
I think I could typically sit and do it for...

3438
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:27,240
Sorry.

3439
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:30,200
For like an hour or something.

3440
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:32,340
Hour two if I really wanted to.

3441
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:35,240
But it's like so...

3442
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,180
It's... it's...

3443
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:41,520
Maybe not the most super duper exciting thing, right?

3444
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,620
Here, I'm gonna actually do this.

3445
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:56,630
No!

3446
02:28:57,730 --> 02:28:59,690
I wanna go back to...

3447
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:01,930
Well, maybe it'll go... maybe it will...

3448
02:29:04,550 --> 02:29:05,950
I don't know what to call it.

3449
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:08,290
Wait, there's continue zone right here.

3450
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:12,690
I don't know what that is.

3451
02:29:16,810 --> 02:29:18,570
I do not know.

3452
02:29:20,470 --> 02:29:21,030
Anyway.

3453
02:29:24,690 --> 02:29:26,690
Sorry if I'm making weird faces.

3454
02:29:28,430 --> 02:29:28,870
Sorry.

3455
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:32,650
Okay.

3456
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:34,930
Did you read the manual?

3457
02:29:35,130 --> 02:29:36,330
It didn't come with a manual!

3458
02:29:40,490 --> 02:29:41,830
It didn't come with a manual.

3459
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,910
Okay, give me one second.

3460
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:44,670
I'm gonna set up...

3461
02:29:44,670 --> 02:29:46,150
Well, quickly...

3462
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:47,550
Hold on.

3463
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:49,310
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

3464
02:29:49,530 --> 02:29:53,160
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

3465
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,380
Oh!

3466
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:02,190
Grr.

3467
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:02,890
Grr.

3468
02:30:02,890 --> 02:30:03,030
Grr.

3469
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:05,570
I'm okay.

3470
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:08,730
I'm fine.

3471
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:10,050
Don't worry about me.

3472
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:13,390
We can just leave it on in the background.

3473
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:15,730
If we would.

3474
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:26,470
Okay.

3475
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:29,710
Oh, what the hell?

3476
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:31,310
Why am I asleep?

3477
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:32,630
Uh-oh.

3478
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:33,170
Hold on.

3479
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:35,550
Oh.

3480
02:30:36,090 --> 02:30:36,830
What did I get?

3481
02:30:37,850 --> 02:30:39,210
I think I did break something.

3482
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:40,790
I think I broke my brain.

3483
02:30:40,890 --> 02:30:40,990
You know, I'm just trying.

3484
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:42,170
You know, I'm just trying.

3485
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:45,770
I think I broke my brain.

3486
02:30:45,850 --> 02:30:46,510
I think I'm.

3487
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:47,750
Oh no!

3488
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:48,790
Wait, wait.

3489
02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:50,790
Hold on.

3490
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:52,350
Uh.

3491
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:53,450
Oh.

3492
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:55,230
Oh.

3493
02:30:55,810 --> 02:30:55,950
Uh.

3494
02:30:59,190 --> 02:30:59,910
Why?

3495
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,410
Oh.

3496
02:31:01,410 --> 02:31:01,830
Woo.

3497
02:31:02,370 --> 02:31:03,090
Oh.

3498
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:05,710
Oh.

3499
02:31:05,710 --> 02:31:06,150
Uh.

3500
02:31:07,270 --> 02:31:07,990
Uh.

3501
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:08,770
Okay.

3502
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:09,290
Okay.

3503
02:31:10,050 --> 02:31:10,770
Uh.

3504
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:13,230
I don't know how to work my body.

3505
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:17,050
I don't know how to work my body, you guys.

3506
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:23,010
Maybe I should... Can you guys hear the machine still?

3507
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:24,090
I'm gonna put on some music.

3508
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:25,450
Let's see.

3509
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:27,710
A little.

3510
02:31:31,470 --> 02:31:33,770
You can hear the birds chirping just a tiny bit.

3511
02:31:58,800 --> 02:31:59,280
Key.

3512
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:01,580
Do.

3513
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:03,780
Key.

3514
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:16,320
Very spring time.

3515
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:18,940
I use this BGM all the time.

3516
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,100
You're a simp.

3517
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:25,400
Thanks for showing off your Pachisot machine and for all the work it took to set this up.

3518
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:26,720
Stream has been really special.

3519
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:30,240
Special is a word for it, isn't it?

3520
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:34,340
That is a word for it, right?

3521
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:39,360
Maybe you're supposed to ignore the 1, 2, 3 and risk it for the biscuit.

3522
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:39,940
I don't know.

3523
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:41,860
Why would they tell us to 1, 2, 3 then?

3524
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:43,660
Oh, snake.

3525
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:44,280
You good?

3526
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:49,760
That always seems to get you blues or yellows, which I think are the lowest value spins.

3527
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:52,440
Maybe... I don't know.

3528
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:55,400
What's the fork count at?

3529
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:57,360
Truly...

3530
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,420
Unforkable measures.

3531
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:03,000
Ugh...

3532
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:06,480
Is this your craziest Metal Gear item?

3533
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:06,900
Probably.

3534
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:13,220
The other thing... I kind of wanted to show it off in the background, but I couldn't fix it in a good way.

3535
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:15,360
Was my... I have a snake standee.

3536
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:19,300
Like a life size... Well, maybe not life size, but I have like a big...

3537
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,900
Snake standee from...

3538
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:25,700
From when they sold...

3539
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:27,440
What was it?

3540
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:28,920
I think it was MGS...

3541
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:31,200
I can't remember actually.

3542
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,900
It was one of the... It was one of the...

3543
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,600
Advertisements in...

3544
02:33:36,300 --> 02:33:37,000
Europe though.

3545
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:40,340
I think... I'm pretty sure it was MGS2.

3546
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:46,330
But like, what's the...

3547
02:33:48,530 --> 02:33:49,250
What's the...

3548
02:33:51,230 --> 02:33:53,050
Oh my gosh, my brain is...

3549
02:33:55,230 --> 02:33:56,870
Is... I have a lack of...

3550
02:33:58,250 --> 02:33:58,690
Ectoplasm...

3551
02:33:59,770 --> 02:34:00,210
Happening.

3552
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:03,890
Is the standee bigger than you?

3553
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:05,050
No, no, no, no.

3554
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:15,170
I can say that was the best VTuber playing Apache Slot stream I've ever seen.

3555
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:17,090
You must watch those a lot.

3556
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:17,650
Truly.

3557
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:22,930
You must watch those all the time.

3558
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:24,230
It's a big market.

3559
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:27,690
Everybody out here is saying...

3560
02:34:28,410 --> 02:34:30,310
VTubers playing Apache Slots.

3561
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:31,470
It's the new...

3562
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:33,530
The new...

3563
02:34:34,470 --> 02:34:34,870
Meta.

3564
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:40,830
There was some...

3565
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:42,750
Hold on, I'm gonna like zoom in a little bit more.

3566
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:45,750
There was some... I did want to like...

3567
02:34:46,610 --> 02:34:47,330
What's the word?

3568
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:51,690
I wanted to talk some more about like my...

3569
02:34:53,790 --> 02:34:54,990
Hashtags and stuff like that.

3570
02:34:55,130 --> 02:34:58,830
I know it's kind of probably not the right stream to do that but...

3571
02:34:59,310 --> 02:35:00,970
Even I was... I was like...

3572
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:01,890
At first, I was like...

3573
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:03,210
I don't need an art tag.

3574
02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:04,730
Whatever.

3575
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,170
But then...

3576
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:10,010
I think I need an art tag.

3577
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:16,440
I feel really sad leaving my old tags and stuff.

3578
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:19,280
And then I also kind of want to talk about like...

3579
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,620
Fan names.

3580
02:35:21,140 --> 02:35:24,260
Sorry, it's like the most random time to talk about this, isn't it?

3581
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:24,980
But...

3582
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,300
Oh!

3583
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:29,720
And if you haven't seen...

3584
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:35,500
Where is it?

3585
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:40,300
My schedule for...

3586
02:35:40,300 --> 02:35:41,380
Well, tomorrow!

3587
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:43,800
Tomorrow I'm playing Zoombinis!

3588
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,400
Oh gosh, my voice...

3589
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:55,960
My throat is still healing so I can't do high notes right now.

3590
02:35:56,420 --> 02:35:56,800
But...

3591
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:01,280
Yeah, but...

3592
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:03,440
On...

3593
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:08,080
Tuesday I'm playing the new Chilla's Heart game.

3594
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:10,400
Because I'm a VTuber, you guys.

3595
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,500
And I have to play it.

3596
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:12,420
I have to.

3597
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:12,980
I'm so sorry.

3598
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:14,200
But also...

3599
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:16,500
I kind of like those like games where it's like...

3600
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:18,340
Find the anomaly.

3601
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:19,800
I think those are kind of fun.

3602
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:21,220
It's mandatory.

3603
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:24,060
I can't say that I'm truly...

3604
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:25,720
Been...

3605
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,960
Resummoned until I play it, you know?

3606
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:30,280
And then...

3607
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,180
Monday is the podcast.

3608
02:36:32,180 --> 02:36:33,900
A release day.

3609
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:34,440
So...

3610
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:36,740
Instead of a stream, you can listen to the podcast.

3611
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:37,540
Probably...

3612
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:39,800
Pretty much every Monday I'll have off.

3613
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:43,000
Just because that's when we'll be releasing the podcast.

3614
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:44,480
So...

3615
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:45,120
Um...

3616
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:46,260
Yes, yes, yes.

3617
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:47,580
Uh...

3618
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:49,760
Wednesday is when we record the podcast.

3619
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:52,740
So I'll have off that day too.

3620
02:36:54,460 --> 02:36:55,060
And...

3621
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:55,820
Uh...

3622
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:56,840
Thursday is Facade.

3623
02:36:57,360 --> 02:36:59,240
Which is a game that I've...

3624
02:36:59,240 --> 02:36:59,860
Uh...

3625
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:00,200
Uh...

3626
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:05,340
I saw a video on it recently and I was like...

3627
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:05,820
Oh my gosh!

3628
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:06,900
I forgot this existed!

3629
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:08,760
Um...

3630
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:11,040
There's like this other old Flash game.

3631
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,280
I think on Newgrounds.

3632
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:12,620
Called...

3633
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:14,900
I think it was like The Negotiator or something.

3634
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,320
Um...

3635
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:17,580
And...

3636
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,300
Uh...

3637
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,140
It always...

3638
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:20,500
I don't know if it's the same person.

3639
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:22,360
It's a classic.

3640
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:22,980
It is.

3641
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:23,320
Yeah.

3642
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:26,040
So...

3643
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:27,520
The Negotiator.

3644
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:27,720
Yeah!

3645
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:28,880
You guys remember it?

3646
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:29,660
Oh my god.

3647
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:31,500
I reference it all the time.

3648
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:33,180
And I don't think people realize.

3649
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:34,040
Anytime...

3650
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:34,300
Well...

3651
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,280
Um...

3652
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:35,740
Like...

3653
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:37,220
I'll be like...

3654
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:38,840
I'm gonna blow this place to hell.

3655
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:39,840
And...

3656
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:42,900
That's why I'm referencing...

3657
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:44,620
The Negotiator.

3658
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:50,960
Oh man.

3659
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:52,900
So silly.

3660
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:53,720
Um...

3661
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,340
And then on...

3662
02:37:54,340 --> 02:37:55,760
Friday, Tomodachi Live.

3663
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:56,840
Um...

3664
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:58,860
I was thinking maybe we can make like a bunch of...

3665
02:37:58,860 --> 02:37:59,620
Silly characters.

3666
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:00,460
Of course like Snake.

3667
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:01,700
Or...

3668
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:02,580
We can...

3669
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:04,060
We'll have you guys decide.

3670
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:07,220
We can make like whatever silly characters we want.

3671
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:08,300
And just have them in.

3672
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:08,860
And then...

3673
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:09,420
Saturday.

3674
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:11,480
Metal Gear Saturdays.

3675
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,560
With the Twin Snakes.

3676
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,180
Um...

3677
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:17,180
I say Metal Gear Saturdays.

3678
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:19,220
I mean we might go after Twin Snakes.

3679
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:20,480
We might go into like...

3680
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:21,240
Acid.

3681
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:22,540
Um...

3682
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:25,660
Cause I have not played Acid yet.

3683
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:26,820
Though...

3684
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:27,420
Oh!

3685
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:28,840
Thank you!

3686
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:29,560
Thank you for the AkaToro!

3687
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:30,180
Thank you!

3688
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:33,220
Thank you so much!

3689
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:37,320
Um...

3690
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:38,840
I meant...

3691
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:39,400
Quick reminder.

3692
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:41,660
It's not a day off if you work that day.

3693
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:42,420
Hope this helps.

3694
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:43,900
Um...

3695
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,300
I don't...

3696
02:38:45,300 --> 02:38:47,000
I mean...

3697
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,240
But it's...

3698
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,660
I don't consider it.

3699
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:57,200
You know?

3700
02:38:57,220 --> 02:38:58,440
It's like...

3701
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:03,280
I don't...

3702
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:03,420
Um...

3703
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:04,620
Memberships will be open on Tuesday.

3704
02:39:04,780 --> 02:39:04,980
Right?

3705
02:39:05,060 --> 02:39:05,760
I have no idea.

3706
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:07,160
That's up to YouTube.

3707
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:07,900
That's not up to me.

3708
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:09,560
Wah!

3709
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:10,960
Hi man!

3710
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:11,560
Hi!

3711
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,760
Thank you for the AkaToro!

3712
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:14,480
Thank you!

3713
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:17,120
How do I say...

3714
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:17,260
Wait.

3715
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:17,880
Osos!

3716
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:18,340
Thank you!

3717
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,200
Jinuko!

3718
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:20,980
Thank you!

3719
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:23,740
Kyun!

3720
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:25,380
Oh my gosh.

3721
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:26,280
Long time no see.

3722
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:27,940
100 plus player.

3723
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:28,880
Tetrio win.

3724
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:29,820
Hahaha.

3725
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:30,820
Hahaha.

3726
02:39:30,820 --> 02:39:30,840
Hahaha.

3727
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:31,000
Hahaha.

3728
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,540
Metal Gear Twin Snakes let's go I remember.

3729
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:39,600
Spoiled myself by accident one time with this game.

3730
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:40,340
Hahaha.

3731
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:41,500
I can't wait.

3732
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:43,260
I can't wait to play Twin Snakes.

3733
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,240
Um...

3734
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:44,680
And then...

3735
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,460
Probably Sunday I'll do a Guerrilla stream.

3736
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,360
Um...

3737
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:49,960
Honestly, I just didn't know what to stream that day.

3738
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:50,640
So I...

3739
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:54,740
I said Guerrilla stream if I come up with something.

3740
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:57,280
Maybe it's Tetrio but I'll be honest you guys.

3741
02:39:57,320 --> 02:39:59,000
I haven't gotten better at all at Tetri...

3742
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:00,980
I haven't gotten better at all at Tetri...

3743
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:02,700
Thank you for all the donuts.

3744
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:03,220
Thank you guys.

3745
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:05,820
I haven't gotten better at all at Tetri.

3746
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:06,860
I, uh...

3747
02:40:08,440 --> 02:40:09,040
Um...

3748
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:14,680
I'm gonna get my butt white whooped.

3749
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:15,760
Hahaha.

3750
02:40:23,420 --> 02:40:24,620
You're Osu!

3751
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:25,700
Hahaha.

3752
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:28,720
Hahaha.

3753
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:30,840
Hahaha.

3754
02:40:37,450 --> 02:40:38,050
Hahaha.

3755
02:40:38,050 --> 02:40:38,510
Hahaha.

3756
02:40:38,650 --> 02:40:38,970
Hahaha.

3757
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:39,550
Hahaha.

3758
02:40:39,550 --> 02:40:39,790
Hahaha.

3759
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:44,340
Hahaha.

3760
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:45,620
Hahaha.

3761
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:46,060
Hahaha.

3762
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:07,470
I'm glad to have finally gotten the definitive MGS3 experience!

3763
02:41:07,910 --> 02:41:08,670
Thanks, Mint!

3764
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:11,150
This stream was definitely more fun than you seemed to think.

3765
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:12,810
I'm glad that you'd say that.

3766
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:13,750
Thank you.

3767
02:41:28,250 --> 02:41:29,650
Thank you, thank you.

3768
02:41:32,970 --> 02:41:37,730
Sorry, girl, but there's at least one Mintomo.

3769
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:38,550
Mintomo!

3770
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:39,510
What is that?

3771
02:41:39,890 --> 02:41:40,190
Thank you.

3772
02:41:40,330 --> 02:41:42,210
That won't wipe your ear.

3773
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:42,770
No, stop.

3774
02:41:43,550 --> 02:41:44,650
Thanks for all the donuts!

3775
02:41:44,830 --> 02:41:45,410
Thank you, guys!

3776
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:48,350
I'm vacuuming your butt for that comment.

3777
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:48,650
No!

3778
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,270
Don't Luigi me!

3779
02:41:52,810 --> 02:41:56,730
To the heroes of Tetris for the privilege to wipe your butt in mine.

3780
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:03,960
I'd wipe someone's...

3781
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:07,400
No!

3782
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:12,480
Oh, man.

3783
02:42:21,150 --> 02:42:21,790
Why?

3784
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:25,710
Why is my brain like this?

3785
02:42:28,490 --> 02:42:29,410
Thank you!

3786
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:31,550
Mint brain, don't say wiped.

3787
02:42:31,610 --> 02:42:32,510
Don't say wiped.

3788
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:34,370
Absolutely do not say wiped.

3789
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:36,010
Mint mouth, wiped.

3790
02:42:40,490 --> 02:42:41,410
Oh, stinky.

3791
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:42,270
Thank you, thank you.

3792
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:43,030
Chuu!

3793
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:43,470
Chuu!

3794
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:46,930
Cool piece of Metal Gear franchise you showed off today.

3795
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:47,550
Thanks for the stream!

3796
02:42:47,650 --> 02:42:49,050
The new Being Haunted could be this one.

3797
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:49,770
Yay!

3798
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:56,250
Yeah, all it requires is giving me a little bit of your life force.

3799
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:57,250
Is that okay?

3800
02:42:57,350 --> 02:42:58,030
Batae funds.

3801
02:42:58,370 --> 02:42:58,690
Chuu!

3802
02:42:59,010 --> 02:42:59,250
Chuu!

3803
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:01,350
Mmm!

3804
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:03,390
Mmm...

3805
02:43:04,810 --> 02:43:05,930
Thank you!

3806
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:06,350
Thank you!

3807
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:12,400
I can't believe I got this invested over watching someone play slots.

3808
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:14,840
It got a little intense sometimes, for real.

3809
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:24,180
It got pretty intense in some sections, I was feeling the pressure, the actual pressure.

3810
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:28,560
Unrelated but I really love your Ace Combat games collection.

3811
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:31,540
Thank you non-John Ace Combat Team!

3812
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:31,560
Yeah!

3813
02:43:33,140 --> 02:43:36,840
I'm so jealous that you have even older Ace Combat, though.

3814
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:38,980
I only have PS2 era, sadly.

3815
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:42,960
I've gone to so many used game stores.

3816
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:49,880
Unfortunately, so many of the ones that I have are in those GameStop-esque boxes.

3817
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:59,140
I only played 7, and when I did, I was like, oh my gosh, I think I love this.

3818
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:06,620
I struggled a little bit with following the story, so it almost felt...

3819
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:07,320
Hold on.

3820
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:08,040
I can't say it.

3821
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:08,220
Wait.

3822
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:16,320
It felt like if I were to have played Metal Gear Rising before the rest of the Metal Gear series.

3823
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:17,060
You know what I mean?

3824
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:29,020
So it's like I really wanted to know more about the rest of the lore.

3825
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:31,460
That's nuts.

3826
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:32,400
I know, right?

3827
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:33,140
Who would do that?

3828
02:44:35,900 --> 02:44:38,520
Play the games in release order, you idiot.

3829
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:44,460
So yeah, I've just been kind of collecting them.

3830
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:48,140
I haven't played any of them yet.

3831
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:51,980
Excited.

3832
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:53,580
Excited.

3833
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,060
JPEG dog lore.

3834
02:44:55,640 --> 02:44:56,120
Yeah!

3835
02:44:57,620 --> 02:44:58,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3836
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:01,880
7 is a new story, but knowing...

3837
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:03,100
Well, I think it was like...

3838
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:05,500
I know it all takes place...

3839
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:06,100
What's it called?

3840
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:10,280
It takes place...

3841
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:12,980
Like, you know, more about the Belkan War and stuff like that.

3842
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:15,300
Like, there's obviously...

3843
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:21,280
There's a lot of lore that didn't feel...

3844
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:25,680
Like, you know, what was it?

3845
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:27,340
Stonehenge and everything like that.

3846
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:28,660
Strange Reel!

3847
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:29,120
Yes, yes.

3848
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:30,720
It all takes place in Strange Reel.

3849
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:31,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3850
02:45:31,660 --> 02:45:33,680
It's from 3, right?

3851
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:36,280
That it takes place in...

3852
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:38,440
Strange...

3853
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:38,920
Reel?

3854
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:40,260
Or 4?

3855
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:41,280
Wait.

3856
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:42,780
I can't remember.

3857
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:46,900
3 or 4, right?

3858
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:50,140
It's 4?

3859
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:51,980
Wait, from 2?

3860
02:45:53,620 --> 02:45:56,220
I thought 1 and 2 were like...

3861
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:57,300
Kind of...

3862
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:58,720
Mostly separate.

3863
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:00,360
Is that not the case?

3864
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:01,840
Am I misunderstood?

3865
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:04,660
Don't worry, I still have my Membu card.

3866
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:07,360
If you open memberships back, I'll be joining back.

3867
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:09,140
Thank you!

3868
02:46:11,020 --> 02:46:11,740
Thanks, Shun.

3869
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:12,720
I hope you're doing well.

3870
02:46:18,490 --> 02:46:20,510
I really enjoyed the stream today.

3871
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:22,710
Thank you, Mike Tyson's butt.

3872
02:46:23,230 --> 02:46:25,450
I hope your butt gets thoroughly wiped.

3873
02:46:26,010 --> 02:46:26,970
In a good way.

3874
02:46:27,550 --> 02:46:28,790
In a good way, right?

3875
02:46:39,330 --> 02:46:41,610
Thanks for the» means.

3876
02:46:41,650 --> 02:46:45,110
Thank you, Shunvoi.

3877
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:49,950
I'll go grab a coffee to stop about 3 avons.

3878
02:46:58,590 --> 02:46:59,050
No, thank you so much.

3879
02:46:59,050 --> 02:46:59,610
I hope everyone is alright this afternoon.

3880
02:46:59,610 --> 02:47:02,010
I don't like to back down from a challenge, so...

3881
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:17,950
Thank you for the stream, for sharing the machine.

3882
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:22,290
I've not seen such an extensive look at it before.

3883
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:25,710
And man, what could have been with the Fox Engine remake...

3884
02:47:25,710 --> 02:47:26,170
I know...

3885
02:47:26,750 --> 02:47:28,450
When you get the theater mode...

3886
02:47:28,450 --> 02:47:30,810
Sometimes, like I said before...

3887
02:47:30,810 --> 02:47:33,910
Before it started playing with the bonus or whatever...

3888
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:35,510
Sometimes it will let you choose.

3889
02:47:35,710 --> 02:47:36,550
Theater mode or...

3890
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:39,810
There is another mode.

3891
02:47:39,890 --> 02:47:41,450
I think the other mode...

3892
02:47:42,150 --> 02:47:44,630
Takes you directly into...

3893
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:45,930
The...

3894
02:47:47,670 --> 02:47:50,750
Like the quote-unquote story part of the game.

3895
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:53,210
So I think it starts you on the helicopter.

3896
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:54,550
But with this, we got both.

3897
02:47:54,650 --> 02:47:56,150
So I guess it worked out, honestly.

3898
02:48:01,470 --> 02:48:02,650
But yeah...

3899
02:48:02,650 --> 02:48:03,830
Seeing the...

3900
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:05,870
Seeing the cutscenes...

3901
02:48:05,870 --> 02:48:06,390
Just...

3902
02:48:08,190 --> 02:48:08,870
Monkey!

3903
02:48:16,030 --> 02:48:17,610
Oh, Ape Escape!

3904
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,090
Yeah, we got to do Ape Escape.

3905
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:20,210
Me so cute.

3906
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:22,230
Yeah!

3907
02:48:25,210 --> 02:48:26,810
Yeah, Mint is adorable.

3908
02:48:27,770 --> 02:48:28,650
Stop it.

3909
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:30,110
Stop it.

3910
02:48:31,530 --> 02:48:32,230
Stop it.

3911
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:33,750
Stop.

3912
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:34,750
Oh my gosh.

3913
02:48:35,990 --> 02:48:36,710
Stop it.

3914
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:37,530
Come on.

3915
02:48:38,270 --> 02:48:38,910
Come on.

3916
02:48:38,910 --> 02:48:39,250
I mean...

3917
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:40,630
I mean, it's like...

3918
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:41,350
I'm a maid.

3919
02:48:41,490 --> 02:48:42,590
Like, I have to be cute, right?

3920
02:48:42,630 --> 02:48:43,710
But like...

3921
02:48:43,710 --> 02:48:44,810
Come on.

3922
02:48:51,910 --> 02:48:52,770
Oh, okay.

3923
02:48:53,790 --> 02:48:54,750
Let's talk...

3924
02:48:55,690 --> 02:48:56,650
Let's talk...

3925
02:48:57,370 --> 02:48:58,330
Fan names.

3926
02:48:59,050 --> 02:49:00,530
In this very...

3927
02:49:00,530 --> 02:49:01,170
Okay.

3928
02:49:02,170 --> 02:49:02,650
Sorry.

3929
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:04,430
I should have done this...

3930
02:49:04,430 --> 02:49:04,910
Last time.

3931
02:49:04,910 --> 02:49:06,850
I don't know what to do.

3932
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:07,790
I refuse.

3933
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:08,610
I just want to be cute.

3934
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:16,410
And that's...

3935
02:49:16,410 --> 02:49:16,510
Yes.

3936
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:16,710
T -Error.

3937
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:17,070
Yes.

3938
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:17,190
Yes.

3939
02:49:18,130 --> 02:49:18,970
No.

3940
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:25,540
Am...

3941
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:25,860
Not...

3942
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:27,020
Great.

3943
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:27,120
Great.

3944
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:29,900
Are you good?

3945
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:31,760
Are you Meh?

3946
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:32,400
Yes.

3947
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:38,840
I don't necessarily want to get rid of the name Fandom, right?

3948
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:49,120
I don't want to throw away everything that we came up with before.

3949
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:55,200
But I do think that having something a little bit more concrete...

3950
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:59,820
Because you can't say, I am a Fandom.

3951
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:02,340
It's more like, I'm part of the Fandom.

3952
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:03,000
You know what I mean?

3953
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:04,840
I think Boo-ties.

3954
02:50:05,660 --> 02:50:06,360
Boo-ties?

3955
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:12,200
Like bow-tie, but a Boo-tie.

3956
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:15,240
Fandom is good?

3957
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:20,840
Boomers.

3958
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:21,820
Boo-champs?

3959
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:23,560
I don't know.

3960
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:24,920
I haven't really thought of it at all.

3961
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,880
Because I kind of just came in thinking that I would have everything the same as before.

3962
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:31,580
So I'm just like...

3963
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:41,160
I think Boomers.

3964
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:44,780
Choco Minto Art?

3965
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:45,920
Wait, that's so cute actually.

3966
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:50,900
I think... I think Boomers feels a little too...

3967
02:50:51,780 --> 02:50:55,440
Like, any ghost Vtuber could have that, right?

3968
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:56,920
As their fandom.

3969
02:50:57,620 --> 02:51:00,540
I think we gotta come up with something a little more specific.

3970
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:03,220
There was Wisps before.

3971
02:51:03,740 --> 02:51:05,620
Like it was Fandom, and then...

3972
02:51:05,620 --> 02:51:08,320
If you were in the Fandom, you were a Wisp.

3973
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:09,840
But...

3974
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:12,720
Hmm...

3975
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:15,600
Phantoms?

3976
02:51:16,660 --> 02:51:18,000
Phantoms in the Fandom?

3977
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:20,160
Like this?

3978
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:24,820
Phantoms?

3979
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:26,820
Insane in the Membrane?

3980
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:28,320
Phantoms in the Fandom?

3981
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:32,480
Mint Busters?

3982
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:33,640
That's kind of cute actually.

3983
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:34,640
Wait, Mint...

3984
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:35,940
Mint...

3985
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:37,300
Mint Busters?

3986
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:44,260
Fantomies?

3987
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:45,560
That's kind of cute too.

3988
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:51,200
That's pretty cute too.

3989
02:51:57,120 --> 02:51:57,520
Hmm...

3990
02:52:02,290 --> 02:52:04,530
I'm seeing if I see any others that I really like.

3991
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:17,720
Thank you for the dough, Noel.

3992
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:20,920
Mentos.

3993
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,020
Oh my god.

3994
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:27,100
This page seems to have some instructions in a forum for the Metal Gear...

3995
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:27,620
What?

3996
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:28,920
Really?

3997
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:38,750
Since our time was cut short, what are the chances of a return to Trials and Tribulations to play this game?

3998
02:52:38,750 --> 02:52:39,590
This is the main cafe...

3999
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:43,570
Wait, that's the DLC, isn't it?

4000
02:52:45,910 --> 02:52:46,950
We'll see.

4001
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:47,930
We'll see.

4002
02:52:48,430 --> 02:52:50,470
I can't just play the DLC episode.

4003
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:52,790
I have to play everything all over again.

4004
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:06,820
Dead Cell.

4005
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:11,580
Dead Cell.

4006
02:53:11,580 --> 02:53:11,820
Dead Cell.

4007
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:12,020
What?

4008
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:13,420
That doesn't even make any sense.

4009
02:53:15,900 --> 02:53:20,220
I kinda love it but...

4010
02:53:20,220 --> 02:53:23,200
I don't want everything to be a Metal Gear reference, you guys.

4011
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:27,380
Not everything can be a Metal Gear reference.

4012
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:30,580
Boots?

4013
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:34,220
I don't get it.

4014
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:37,660
Like dudes?

4015
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:43,600
I'm not feeling it.

4016
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:44,180
Sorry.

4017
02:53:54,270 --> 02:53:58,350
Fandom with the mods as wisps and us as memboos.

4018
02:53:58,410 --> 02:54:00,530
Well memboos is the membership though.

4019
02:54:09,410 --> 02:54:10,490
Okay, shut up you.

4020
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:18,090
See, and part of me wants to keep things...

4021
02:54:20,870 --> 02:54:24,090
The same as before too, but like...

4022
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:25,930
We have to be honest.

4023
02:54:26,030 --> 02:54:27,090
Things aren't the same.

4024
02:54:27,650 --> 02:54:30,230
Things are a little different than they were before.

4025
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:33,570
Can we just keep wisps?

4026
02:54:34,530 --> 02:54:35,570
But you don't want anything?

4027
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:38,290
You don't want something more... specific?

4028
02:54:44,610 --> 02:54:45,150
To...

4029
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:49,720
To...

4030
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:50,560
To...

4031
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:50,580
Me?

4032
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:53,240
I'm so egotistical.

4033
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,540
It has to be related to me, you guys.

4034
02:54:55,580 --> 02:54:55,980
No, I'm just kidding.

4035
02:54:58,660 --> 02:54:59,200
Mintomo?

4036
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:04,260
Buh... Buh... Brigade.

4037
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:07,460
Oh, like brigade.

4038
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:10,820
Buh... Buh... Brigade.

4039
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:18,440
Ugh, this is all... I think no matter what I choose, I can't make everybody happy.

4040
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:20,420
So I think I just gotta choose what I like the most.

4041
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:23,120
Cause...

4042
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:25,260
It'll still be.

4043
02:55:26,260 --> 02:55:28,460
Like if it's... you know, it's...

4044
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:33,800
You are awesome.

4045
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:40,720
Min... min...

4046
02:55:41,550 --> 02:55:43,320
Min... te... min... te...

4047
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:44,180
Min...

4048
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,980
Min... tes...

4049
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:48,340
Sotens.

4050
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:49,400
Oh!

4051
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:51,860
Mintesotens!

4052
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:55,620
Like a Minnesotan?

4053
02:55:57,310 --> 02:55:58,280
Like Minnesota?

4054
02:55:59,570 --> 02:56:03,700
Like the... the... the state in the United States of America, Minnesota.

4055
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:09,540
That's wild.

4056
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,340
Why...

4057
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:15,940
That's actually crazy.

4058
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:19,380
Uh oh, I think my chat froze.

4059
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:21,420
Are you guys still there?

4060
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:23,040
Oh, okay.

4061
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:24,360
It froze on YouTube.

4062
02:56:24,580 --> 02:56:27,080
YouTube has been freezing so much for me recently.

4063
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:31,160
Don't know if you said this before, but are weekend streams always early?

4064
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:36,420
The upcoming weekday streams are a bit too late to catch for me, unfortunately.

4065
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:37,660
Ah...

4066
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:40,820
Ah... I didn't say before.

4067
02:56:41,980 --> 02:56:44,880
Weekend streams, I typically do a little bit earlier.

4068
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:46,300
Um...

4069
02:56:46,300 --> 02:56:51,100
But also in the weekday, I'll try and do some midday stuff as well.

4070
02:56:51,440 --> 02:56:52,460
So, uh...

4071
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:55,880
There will be a mix of stuff.

4072
02:56:56,060 --> 02:56:58,660
My schedule's never truly consistent, unfortunately.

4073
02:56:58,900 --> 02:56:59,600
I'm sorry.

4074
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:01,260
I'm all over the place.

4075
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:02,800
But, uh...

4076
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:08,600
But there will be times that will be good for EU watchers.

4077
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:10,060
If there are any.

4078
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:11,340
As well.

4079
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:12,160
So...

4080
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:16,680
Yeah, sorry that I don't have a set...

4081
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:20,440
I don't think I've ever had really a set time where I'm just like, Okay, guys!

4082
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:21,860
Every day!

4083
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:24,660
7pm EST!

4084
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:27,080
Catch me here!

4085
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:28,780
No, sometimes...

4086
02:57:28,780 --> 02:57:29,360
I don't know why.

4087
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:31,960
Sometimes I'll be like, Today's 7.

4088
02:57:33,060 --> 02:57:34,360
But tomorrow is 6.

4089
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:35,920
I don't know why.

4090
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:37,160
It's...

4091
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:39,860
Maybe just because I try to do a little bit of variety.

4092
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:43,380
For people who are just like, Oh, I can't make the 7pm times.

4093
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:45,360
I can only do the 6pm times.

4094
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:46,560
So...

4095
02:57:47,500 --> 02:57:47,940
Yeah.

4096
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:52,260
I'm fine with whatever you choose.

4097
02:57:52,320 --> 02:57:53,820
Can I get some of that dripping chocolate?

4098
02:58:00,020 --> 02:58:01,040
I feel uncomfortable.

4099
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:08,640
Well, I'm gonna try and reset my...

4100
02:58:14,290 --> 02:58:14,730
YouTube.

4101
02:58:28,870 --> 02:58:29,590
Okay.

4102
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:30,550
You're a suit.

4103
02:58:30,650 --> 02:58:31,790
There we go.

4104
02:58:31,990 --> 02:58:32,910
Thank you.

4105
02:58:32,990 --> 02:58:34,010
You mentioned.

4106
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:34,610
Let's go.

4107
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:38,370
Okay.

4108
02:58:40,870 --> 02:58:41,950
The fanchies?

4109
02:58:42,310 --> 02:58:42,650
Wait.

4110
02:58:42,730 --> 02:58:43,290
That's so cute.

4111
02:58:43,370 --> 02:58:43,810
Actually.

4112
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:51,240
I'm gonna go...

4113
02:58:51,240 --> 02:58:57,260
I'm kind of leaning... towards phantomies.

4114
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,660
Because it sounds close enough to fandom.

4115
02:59:23,430 --> 02:59:30,810
I think phantomies, maybe.

4116
02:59:43,390 --> 02:59:45,790
Because it's like phantomies...

4117
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:48,450
in the...

4118
02:59:48,770 --> 02:59:49,410
in the...

4119
02:59:49,990 --> 02:59:52,610
See, for me, when I say like, hey...

4120
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:54,850
I'm a wisp.

4121
02:59:55,130 --> 02:59:59,070
It doesn't feel, to me, so much like a...

4122
03:00:00,070 --> 03:00:02,570
Like, it just feels like a description.

4123
03:00:02,870 --> 03:00:04,210
Like, you guys are wisps.

4124
03:00:05,190 --> 03:00:09,170
But like, you're a phantomie wisp.

4125
03:00:13,010 --> 03:00:13,490
I think.

4126
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:15,130
Right?

4127
03:00:15,550 --> 03:00:16,290
Like...

4128
03:00:17,010 --> 03:00:18,330
It's more like a...

4129
03:00:18,330 --> 03:00:22,490
My wisp type is phantomie.

4130
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:28,730
And memberships are the members.

4131
03:00:34,670 --> 03:00:36,470
Sounds like the buttriots.

4132
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:42,730
Hmm...

4133
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:48,290
So I think we'll go with phantomies.

4134
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:49,810
If you guys are okay with it.

4135
03:00:56,750 --> 03:00:58,650
Phantomies in the fan...

4136
03:00:59,350 --> 03:00:59,870
Fandom.

4137
03:01:05,270 --> 03:01:07,430
For those who still like fandom.

4138
03:01:07,610 --> 03:01:09,330
Of course, you can still use it.

4139
03:01:09,430 --> 03:01:10,530
Of course, of course.

4140
03:01:15,690 --> 03:01:16,210
Okay.

4141
03:01:16,350 --> 03:01:17,470
It's been decided.

4142
03:01:17,470 --> 03:01:19,730
I lay down the hammer.

4143
03:01:24,690 --> 03:01:25,210
Okay.

4144
03:01:26,470 --> 03:01:27,670
I feel so...

4145
03:01:27,670 --> 03:01:28,550
I feel so...

4146
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:30,110
I don't know.

4147
03:01:30,710 --> 03:01:31,910
I don't know how to feel.

4148
03:01:32,030 --> 03:01:33,130
Like, I feel so...

4149
03:01:33,130 --> 03:01:33,910
What's the word?

4150
03:01:37,370 --> 03:01:37,890
Maybe...

4151
03:01:37,890 --> 03:01:38,650
Not like...

4152
03:01:38,650 --> 03:01:39,650
It's like almost guilt.

4153
03:01:39,810 --> 03:01:40,130
You know?

4154
03:01:40,670 --> 03:01:42,010
It almost feels like...

4155
03:01:42,010 --> 03:01:42,790
Like a guilt.

4156
03:01:43,350 --> 03:01:43,870
But...

4157
03:01:44,810 --> 03:01:46,010
Don't think that...

4158
03:01:46,010 --> 03:01:46,390
You know?

4159
03:01:46,390 --> 03:01:48,150
Because we're making a few little changes.

4160
03:01:48,730 --> 03:01:49,390
You know?

4161
03:01:49,390 --> 03:01:50,270
Sometimes...

4162
03:01:50,270 --> 03:01:52,810
This happens to other VTubers as well.

4163
03:01:52,910 --> 03:01:54,170
Where they have to change their...

4164
03:01:54,170 --> 03:01:56,310
Fan names for whatever reason.

4165
03:01:58,550 --> 03:01:59,130
So...

4166
03:01:59,130 --> 03:01:59,810
Um...

4167
03:02:01,630 --> 03:02:03,230
Will they be redesigned?

4168
03:02:03,910 --> 03:02:04,490
What?

4169
03:02:04,610 --> 03:02:05,870
The Wisp design?

4170
03:02:06,010 --> 03:02:06,470
No, no.

4171
03:02:06,970 --> 03:02:08,070
It's still the same.

4172
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:16,780
So...

4173
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:20,040
I don't mind?

4174
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:20,500
Okay.

4175
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:21,400
Thank you, Splagoon.

4176
03:02:27,500 --> 03:02:28,380
I don't know.

4177
03:02:28,420 --> 03:02:30,900
I just got so many questions from people being like...

4178
03:02:30,900 --> 03:02:31,020
What?

4179
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:32,940
What do I call myself?

4180
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:33,720
And like...

4181
03:02:33,720 --> 03:02:34,660
I think...

4182
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:35,060
You know?

4183
03:02:35,060 --> 03:02:36,640
Like I said back then...

4184
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:38,140
We came up with stuff.

4185
03:02:38,380 --> 03:02:38,780
But...

4186
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:40,360
It was kind of like...

4187
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:41,080
Multiple things.

4188
03:02:41,220 --> 03:02:42,620
I think we need to settle on...

4189
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:44,580
Some more definitive...

4190
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:45,520
Stuff.

4191
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:46,200
You know what I mean?

4192
03:02:48,620 --> 03:02:49,580
Something a little...

4193
03:02:49,580 --> 03:02:49,800
Like...

4194
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:50,160
I don't know.

4195
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:51,200
Wisps is still fine.

4196
03:02:51,300 --> 03:02:51,380
But...

4197
03:02:51,380 --> 03:02:54,020
I don't know.

4198
03:02:54,780 --> 03:02:56,640
Am I overthinking this?

4199
03:02:57,700 --> 03:02:59,320
Am I over thinking this?

4200
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:01,240
Maybe I'm overthinking this.

4201
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:02,060
I don't know!

4202
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:02,740
I don't know!

4203
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:04,080
Am I?

4204
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:05,180
Yes?

4205
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:13,360
Shall we just keep it as...

4206
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:16,180
Shall we just...

4207
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:19,520
Should we just keep it as Whisp?

4208
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:20,060
You know what?

4209
03:03:20,400 --> 03:03:21,000
Okay.

4210
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:21,360
Yeah.

4211
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:25,000
What do I do?

4212
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:35,040
Pull?

4213
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:35,760
Okay, pull.

4214
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:38,420
I don't want this responsibility.

4215
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:55,320
I don't want this responsibility.

4216
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:57,160
You decide.

4217
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:23,520
If you don't like the poll result, then you know what answer you really want.

4218
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:24,160
That's true.

4219
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:24,720
That's true.

4220
03:04:38,320 --> 03:04:40,460
I just don't want people mad at me.

4221
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:42,740
You know?

4222
03:04:44,320 --> 03:04:45,380
I just don't want people mad at me.

4223
03:04:45,400 --> 03:04:46,720
I don't want people being like, oh no.

4224
03:04:47,260 --> 03:04:48,760
She's changed too much.

4225
03:04:49,580 --> 03:04:50,480
I don't know.

4226
03:04:50,940 --> 03:04:52,460
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

4227
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:57,920
Can't please everyone.

4228
03:04:58,340 --> 03:04:59,100
Yeah, I know.

4229
03:05:01,640 --> 03:05:04,580
I know, I know, I know, I know.

4230
03:05:11,270 --> 03:05:14,310
And I know this is probably not even that big of a deal.

4231
03:05:15,010 --> 03:05:16,210
It's just a fandom.

4232
03:05:20,610 --> 03:05:20,730
But...

4233
03:05:24,900 --> 03:05:26,540
It was because...

4234
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:30,340
I get so confused when it's like, you have the wisps.

4235
03:05:30,400 --> 03:05:31,180
You have the fandom.

4236
03:05:31,440 --> 03:05:32,220
You have the members.

4237
03:05:32,460 --> 03:05:33,140
You have this.

4238
03:05:33,400 --> 03:05:34,020
You have that.

4239
03:05:34,200 --> 03:05:37,820
And, I'm like, I can't keep up either.

4240
03:05:41,660 --> 03:05:42,180
And,

4241
03:05:46,540 --> 03:05:51,100
I'm like, I can't keep up either.

4242
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:51,140
And, I'm like, I can't keep up either.

4243
03:05:51,140 --> 03:05:51,420
Okay.

4244
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:51,740
Okay.

4245
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:55,180
Well, Fantomys seems to have the consensus.

4246
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:57,160
Not by much.

4247
03:05:57,440 --> 03:05:58,440
I will give it that.

4248
03:05:58,580 --> 03:05:59,480
Not by much.

4249
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:02,800
And not everybody watching... Oh!

4250
03:06:04,020 --> 03:06:05,360
There's more votes coming in?

4251
03:06:05,640 --> 03:06:07,900
I was gonna say, not everybody watching is voting.

4252
03:06:08,420 --> 03:06:09,220
Hey guys!

4253
03:06:09,540 --> 03:06:10,040
No, I'm just kidding.

4254
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:10,980
You don't have to vote.

4255
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:11,380
It's okay.

4256
03:06:12,900 --> 03:06:13,340
Oh!

4257
03:06:13,340 --> 03:06:13,780
Oh!

4258
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:14,880
More votes coming in?

4259
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:17,740
I'll just keep it up.

4260
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:21,200
Well, we'll keep this up and then we can decide hashtags.

4261
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:26,800
Flip the W and rearrange the letters.

4262
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:28,740
And you have what we really are.

4263
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:29,500
Simps.

4264
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:29,940
Stop!

4265
03:06:30,900 --> 03:06:31,540
No!

4266
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:37,560
Okay.

4267
03:06:43,420 --> 03:06:44,060
You're...

4268
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,700
a simp.

4269
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:53,180
Um...

4270
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:55,340
Um... Okay.

4271
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:56,040
Hashtag.

4272
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:58,180
So, I need an art tag.

4273
03:06:58,700 --> 03:06:59,360
What was that?

4274
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:02,080
Choco mint art.

4275
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:02,680
That was cute.

4276
03:07:03,380 --> 03:07:05,700
I have to make sure no one's using stuff though.

4277
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,700
Um... I guess we can keep my...

4278
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:10,500
current one as like...

4279
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:11,720
It's still a general tag.

4280
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:13,440
It's even written as that.

4281
03:07:13,580 --> 03:07:16,000
So, we can still keep it as that too.

4282
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:19,160
Um...

4283
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:22,520
Um...

4284
03:07:29,650 --> 03:07:30,590
No, we're not...

4285
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:32,390
Why you guys have to say...

4286
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:33,870
Fant...

4287
03:07:33,870 --> 03:07:34,990
Art.

4288
03:07:39,050 --> 03:07:40,570
Mint paste.

4289
03:07:43,870 --> 03:07:45,430
Simps rise up.

4290
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,980
The will of the wisps is phantomies.

4291
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:57,840
Stop saying fart.

4292
03:07:58,300 --> 03:07:59,020
Stop.

4293
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:00,820
Stop it.

4294
03:08:00,980 --> 03:08:02,460
Stop saying fart.

4295
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:04,000
Stop it.

4296
03:08:04,780 --> 03:08:05,500
Stop.

4297
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:07,380
Ghosts can't even fart, you guys.

4298
03:08:08,360 --> 03:08:09,340
This is...

4299
03:08:09,340 --> 03:08:10,480
This is not even accurate.

4300
03:08:12,340 --> 03:08:13,780
Stop saying...

4301
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:19,860
Stop saying...

4302
03:08:19,860 --> 03:08:21,140
fart, please.

4303
03:08:21,520 --> 03:08:22,860
Not with that attitude.

4304
03:08:26,180 --> 03:08:27,320
Ghosts are all fart?

4305
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:28,400
What are you talking about?

4306
03:08:29,500 --> 03:08:30,820
What is ectoplasm?

4307
03:08:30,920 --> 03:08:32,260
It's like a little more gooey.

4308
03:08:40,300 --> 03:08:41,180
Ghost post?

4309
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:42,400
Oh my gosh, wait.

4310
03:08:43,340 --> 03:08:44,220
Hashtag ghost.

4311
03:08:44,380 --> 03:08:45,840
But it doesn't have to do with art.

4312
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:46,940
I think that's the hardest thing.

4313
03:08:47,320 --> 03:08:48,460
It's probably also taken.

4314
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:51,280
Snakes just been... I think snake is lost.

4315
03:08:51,640 --> 03:08:54,200
He can't find his way through the forest at all.

4316
03:08:54,360 --> 03:08:54,780
He can't find his way through the forest at all.

4317
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:12,180
Fan art?

4318
03:09:12,320 --> 03:09:13,540
Oh, that's kind of cute.

4319
03:09:15,980 --> 03:09:16,760
Like that?

4320
03:09:17,260 --> 03:09:18,720
Wait, that's actually so cute.

4321
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:21,700
Wait, that's...

4322
03:09:21,700 --> 03:09:23,120
Wait, it's probably taken.

4323
03:09:23,700 --> 03:09:24,540
Let's check.

4324
03:09:24,680 --> 03:09:25,140
Let's check.

4325
03:09:30,390 --> 03:09:31,290
There's like...

4326
03:09:32,450 --> 03:09:33,810
Some yaoi parry.

4327
03:09:34,050 --> 03:09:35,070
Thank you, thank you.

4328
03:09:36,590 --> 03:09:38,290
I don't think I can use this.

4329
03:09:40,130 --> 03:09:41,910
There's like some yaoi parry.

4330
03:09:43,250 --> 03:09:43,950
Oh my god.

4331
03:09:44,010 --> 03:09:45,250
These get a little graphic.

4332
03:09:50,930 --> 03:09:52,130
It's just some guys.

4333
03:09:56,550 --> 03:09:57,970
I don't think I can take...

4334
03:09:57,970 --> 03:09:59,170
I don't think I can use it.

4335
03:10:07,730 --> 03:10:08,630
I don't think I can take...

4336
03:10:08,630 --> 03:10:09,370
I know what will fix it.

4337
03:10:09,990 --> 03:10:10,470
I know what will fix it.

4338
03:10:11,910 --> 03:10:12,910
You're a snake.

4339
03:10:15,490 --> 03:10:17,950
I wonder if this is actually...

4340
03:10:17,950 --> 03:10:20,110
We just do fanfart!

4341
03:10:20,750 --> 03:10:21,870
It works!

4342
03:10:22,670 --> 03:10:24,610
Wait, I have to see if this is taken.

4343
03:10:25,070 --> 03:10:25,090
Wait, I have to see if this is taken.

4344
03:10:25,330 --> 03:10:26,470
This is fun.

4345
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:41,670
Fantography?

4346
03:10:42,030 --> 03:10:42,990
Wait, that's so cute too.

4347
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:45,890
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

4348
03:10:50,090 --> 03:10:52,930
I feel like this is probably taken, but we can check.

4349
03:10:54,650 --> 03:10:55,910
It's hard being a ghost.

4350
03:10:59,570 --> 03:11:02,870
Because there's so many other ghosts.

4351
03:11:03,590 --> 03:11:07,770
Oh, this one doesn't seem to be used very much.

4352
03:11:13,870 --> 03:11:14,550
Maybe?

4353
03:11:16,250 --> 03:11:18,370
Oh, with an F?

4354
03:11:18,970 --> 03:11:19,830
Like that?

4355
03:11:23,010 --> 03:11:23,690
Mintography?

4356
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:26,730
You guys are going crazy.

4357
03:11:30,230 --> 03:11:31,030
Phantom paint?

4358
03:11:32,850 --> 03:11:34,370
This one's a little punny, right?

4359
03:11:34,470 --> 03:11:34,990
It's kind of fun.

4360
03:11:38,550 --> 03:11:40,430
Yeah, this one... wait, Latest.

4361
03:11:41,190 --> 03:11:42,950
This one doesn't seem to be used at all.

4362
03:11:43,310 --> 03:11:44,930
Well, a little bit, but you know.

4363
03:11:45,630 --> 03:11:48,470
It's hard to find a hashtag that's not used at all.

4364
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:51,670
And you know what?

4365
03:11:51,730 --> 03:11:55,690
This kind of fits in with the theme of the general hashtag.

4366
03:11:55,810 --> 03:11:56,510
Since it's...

4367
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:58,070
Shinrei Shashin.

4368
03:11:59,010 --> 03:12:00,490
Which is spirit photography.

4369
03:12:00,850 --> 03:12:02,010
That's what it means in Japanese.

4370
03:12:04,370 --> 03:12:05,250
Mint sightings?

4371
03:12:05,250 --> 03:12:06,130
Wait, that's so cute too.

4372
03:12:07,830 --> 03:12:09,510
I like that for like...

4373
03:12:10,270 --> 03:12:11,870
If you ever...

4374
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:13,970
Like... well, I don't...

4375
03:12:13,970 --> 03:12:17,950
Well, if you get like the merch and you like take a picture of me somewhere.

4376
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:21,510
But I guess that works with the Shinrei Shashin too.

4377
03:12:23,090 --> 03:12:26,030
You can probably use the other hashtag for it.

4378
03:12:31,530 --> 03:12:33,630
If you take a picture of me?

4379
03:12:34,310 --> 03:12:34,990
NSFW tag!

4380
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:41,520
I like fantography, though.

4381
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:42,120
I think that's good.

4382
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:43,280
I think we can go with that.

4383
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:46,180
I think I'll go with the fantography.

4384
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:48,240
Do I...

4385
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:51,540
Do I have to...

4386
03:12:58,890 --> 03:13:01,030
Because why are you so fast with that?

4387
03:13:21,330 --> 03:13:23,430
Maybe it's necessary.

4388
03:13:23,830 --> 03:13:25,030
I don't know.

4389
03:13:27,910 --> 03:13:32,770
So that certain things don't show up in the fantography.

4390
03:13:35,390 --> 03:13:36,830
Only fans!

4391
03:13:36,990 --> 03:13:38,150
Oh my god.

4392
03:13:38,470 --> 03:13:39,350
Like this?

4393
03:13:42,770 --> 03:13:43,510
Like that?

4394
03:13:50,510 --> 03:13:52,690
I feel like that has to be taken though, right?

4395
03:13:57,910 --> 03:13:59,510
Please no R18.

4396
03:13:59,710 --> 03:14:01,210
Is this $100 enough?

4397
03:14:01,450 --> 03:14:04,770
At least maybe any R18 is untagged.

4398
03:14:08,830 --> 03:14:10,570
The fact that you donated!

4399
03:14:11,030 --> 03:14:12,410
I don't know for that.

4400
03:14:12,410 --> 03:14:15,010
Also, only fans is definitely taken.

4401
03:14:15,170 --> 03:14:17,370
Do not... I don't want to look at it.

4402
03:14:22,210 --> 03:14:28,530
I'm just afraid that if people draw stuff that they'll put it in the art tag and then it'll show up mainstream.

4403
03:14:30,330 --> 03:14:32,070
Not safe for Mint.

4404
03:14:34,770 --> 03:14:35,330
No!

4405
03:14:45,240 --> 03:14:48,960
I don't think having a tag necessarily encourages it.

4406
03:14:49,080 --> 03:14:54,280
It's just so that if it does show up, it's in its own place.

4407
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:57,440
I think.

4408
03:15:01,330 --> 03:15:04,690
I don't... I don't know.

4409
03:15:05,370 --> 03:15:06,710
Maybe we don't need it.

4410
03:15:06,810 --> 03:15:07,210
I don't know.

4411
03:15:09,390 --> 03:15:13,270
Not everyone has one, so it's not so necessary.

4412
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:14,790
I don't know.

4413
03:15:17,950 --> 03:15:18,350
Hmm...

4414
03:15:25,650 --> 03:15:27,230
Oh, I think you're in the raid!

4415
03:15:35,920 --> 03:15:37,160
I'll think about this one.

4416
03:15:37,380 --> 03:15:38,560
I will think about this one.

4417
03:15:38,960 --> 03:15:40,080
I'll think about this one.

4418
03:15:41,540 --> 03:15:43,140
I still... I feel weird about it.

4419
03:15:43,220 --> 03:15:44,260
I don't know.

4420
03:15:44,320 --> 03:15:44,600
I don't know.

4421
03:15:44,660 --> 03:15:44,840
I don't know.

4422
03:15:48,240 --> 03:15:50,040
Especially with people just coming in.

4423
03:15:53,820 --> 03:15:55,240
Especially with people just coming in.

4424
03:15:55,280 --> 03:15:55,580
I'm like...

4425
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:59,160
Let's just get this off the screen real quick.

4426
03:16:06,200 --> 03:16:09,720
I think I... I have the live tag, Minto Live.

4427
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:12,520
And I have the general tag.

4428
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:13,720
And I have the art tag.

4429
03:16:13,900 --> 03:16:14,620
I think that's good enough.

4430
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:16,160
I think that's good enough.

4431
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:19,320
Anything other... like if it's not art...

4432
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:21,000
You can put it in the general tag.

4433
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:22,580
And I think it'll be okay.

4434
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:27,080
Cosplay tag?

4435
03:16:27,380 --> 03:16:28,700
I don't think I need one.

4436
03:16:28,900 --> 03:16:30,140
I really don't think I need one.

4437
03:16:30,220 --> 03:16:32,860
I think you can put cosplay in the general tag.

4438
03:16:33,220 --> 03:16:34,340
Because I'll still check it.

4439
03:16:34,460 --> 03:16:37,000
When you have so many hashtags, it's hard to check all of them.

4440
03:16:37,220 --> 03:16:38,800
So... yeah.

4441
03:16:41,180 --> 03:16:42,140
Memes in general tag?

4442
03:16:42,300 --> 03:16:43,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4443
03:16:43,820 --> 03:16:45,940
Just put it all in the general tag.

4444
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:46,820
Unless it's art.

4445
03:16:46,820 --> 03:16:50,880
Cos for art, like I like to... you know, obviously I go through it for...

4446
03:16:52,100 --> 03:16:52,580
For...

4447
03:16:55,460 --> 03:16:57,380
Like thumbnails and stuff like that.

4448
03:16:57,620 --> 03:16:57,960
So...

4449
03:16:59,240 --> 03:17:03,080
So we'll have art... live... is...

4450
03:17:06,380 --> 03:17:06,860
Minto...

4451
03:17:11,480 --> 03:17:12,440
Minto... live...

4452
03:17:12,440 --> 03:17:14,840
As it has been... always?

4453
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:22,560
Busted makes me feel good.

4454
03:17:23,420 --> 03:17:27,440
I think that is probably already used so much.

4455
03:17:29,080 --> 03:17:31,200
I do like not save for Minto.

4456
03:17:31,240 --> 03:17:32,220
I think that's really funny.

4457
03:17:35,940 --> 03:17:37,680
My keyboard no do JP?

4458
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:39,620
Copy and paste!

4459
03:17:42,040 --> 03:17:43,280
Copy and paste.

4460
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:44,360
Copy and paste.

4461
03:17:48,280 --> 03:17:49,420
Copy and paste.

4462
03:17:49,420 --> 03:17:52,100
Probably you could do it in English if you wanted to, but...

4463
03:17:53,980 --> 03:17:54,660
Hashtag...

4464
03:17:55,720 --> 03:17:57,040
Minto... live...

4465
03:17:58,140 --> 03:17:59,160
I wonder...

4466
03:18:02,100 --> 03:18:03,360
The last thing...

4467
03:18:04,360 --> 03:18:04,640
Oh!

4468
03:18:04,700 --> 03:18:07,800
I was like...

4469
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:10,460
You guys would think I'm stupid.

4470
03:18:14,240 --> 03:18:14,920
Oh!

4471
03:18:14,960 --> 03:18:16,220
It's mint olive!

4472
03:18:18,440 --> 03:18:21,320
I searched... Hashtag... Minto... live...

4473
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:24,520
And it... I clicked latest and it was a soap...

4474
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:26,800
And it said mint and rosemary and I was like...

4475
03:18:26,800 --> 03:18:27,420
Mint!

4476
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:28,360
That's me!

4477
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:32,360
Even though I searched...

4478
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:34,200
Even though...

4479
03:18:36,020 --> 03:18:39,040
Even though I searched mint myself...

4480
03:18:41,720 --> 03:18:44,560
First time here and love the MGS3 gacha experience.

4481
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:45,480
Thank you!

4482
03:18:47,520 --> 03:18:48,880
Thanks for being here!

4483
03:18:51,740 --> 03:18:53,120
Oh man...

4484
03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:57,080
But also it's mint and rosemary extra virgin olive oil soap.

4485
03:18:57,320 --> 03:18:58,280
I was like...

4486
03:18:58,280 --> 03:18:59,260
Mint olive!

4487
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:00,820
Is the hashtag.

4488
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:02,200
Hashtag... Mint olive!

4489
03:19:04,220 --> 03:19:05,580
That's so funny.

4490
03:19:07,420 --> 03:19:08,900
Mint olive...

4491
03:19:09,560 --> 03:19:10,480
But yeah, okay.

4492
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:11,680
Those can be the hashtags.

4493
03:19:12,980 --> 03:19:13,720
Um...

4494
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:14,720
And then...

4495
03:19:16,560 --> 03:19:17,000
Uh...

4496
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:18,220
Yes.

4497
03:19:22,370 --> 03:19:24,010
Fantomys is still winning but it...

4498
03:19:24,450 --> 03:19:25,850
It went down a little.

4499
03:19:28,870 --> 03:19:30,410
I still don't know what to do.

4500
03:19:30,550 --> 03:19:31,750
Maybe I'll sleep on it.

4501
03:19:31,810 --> 03:19:32,570
I'll sleep on it!

4502
03:19:32,870 --> 03:19:34,470
And I'll make a tweet about it.

4503
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:36,250
So that we can...

4504
03:19:36,970 --> 03:19:37,770
We can...

4505
03:19:39,310 --> 03:19:40,950
Maybe I'll ask Google.

4506
03:19:41,150 --> 03:19:42,190
I'll say... I'll give it...

4507
03:19:42,190 --> 03:19:43,130
You know, I'll spin a wheel.

4508
03:19:45,790 --> 03:19:47,570
But I'll make a tweet about all this.

4509
03:19:47,590 --> 03:19:47,950
Being like...

4510
03:19:47,950 --> 03:19:48,510
Here's hashtags.

4511
03:19:49,810 --> 03:19:51,070
It's just these three.

4512
03:19:52,750 --> 03:19:53,230
And...

4513
03:19:53,230 --> 03:19:54,430
Here's the fan name.

4514
03:19:56,170 --> 03:19:56,650
And...

4515
03:19:57,490 --> 03:19:57,970
Yeah.

4516
03:19:59,450 --> 03:19:59,930
Yeah.

4517
03:20:00,830 --> 03:20:01,430
We'll see.

4518
03:20:05,210 --> 03:20:07,270
Ask Matara for her opinion as well.

4519
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:08,310
Yeah, maybe I will.

4520
03:20:08,570 --> 03:20:09,050
Because...

4521
03:20:11,170 --> 03:20:11,650
She...

4522
03:20:11,650 --> 03:20:13,950
I tend to ask her for...

4523
03:20:13,950 --> 03:20:15,170
Like her opinion on...

4524
03:20:15,170 --> 03:20:16,270
Things a lot too.

4525
03:20:19,150 --> 03:20:21,290
Anything else you wanted to discuss with us?

4526
03:20:22,050 --> 03:20:22,650
No?

4527
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:23,650
You are dismissed?

4528
03:20:24,150 --> 03:20:25,690
Class is dismissed?

4529
03:20:26,290 --> 03:20:27,270
No, no.

4530
03:20:27,290 --> 03:20:28,390
I just wanted to hang out too.

4531
03:20:28,690 --> 03:20:29,230
You know.

4532
03:20:30,530 --> 03:20:32,130
I feel like...

4533
03:20:32,990 --> 03:20:34,190
Since I've gotten back...

4534
03:20:34,190 --> 03:20:35,230
I mean last stream...

4535
03:20:35,230 --> 03:20:36,970
Maybe I didn't talk so much.

4536
03:20:37,070 --> 03:20:37,850
It was like...

4537
03:20:37,850 --> 03:20:39,530
Me answering things...

4538
03:20:39,530 --> 03:20:40,350
And then singing.

4539
03:20:40,470 --> 03:20:41,810
So it was less talking.

4540
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:44,030
Matara Miller.

4541
03:20:47,750 --> 03:20:49,050
That's perfect.

4542
03:20:49,150 --> 03:20:49,890
Because...

4543
03:20:49,890 --> 03:20:52,190
That means...

4544
03:20:52,190 --> 03:20:52,950
Um...

4545
03:20:54,310 --> 03:20:55,910
That means...

4546
03:20:55,910 --> 03:20:56,730
She...

4547
03:20:56,730 --> 03:20:58,010
Will die.

4548
03:20:59,250 --> 03:21:01,010
Maybe by my hands.

4549
03:21:01,130 --> 03:21:03,150
After I finish...

4550
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:03,950
Um...

4551
03:21:03,950 --> 03:21:04,850
Sucking her soul.

4552
03:21:05,090 --> 03:21:05,750
You know?

4553
03:21:15,500 --> 03:21:17,100
Soul sucker.

4554
03:21:17,260 --> 03:21:17,860
She...

4555
03:21:17,860 --> 03:21:18,120
She's...

4556
03:21:36,010 --> 03:21:37,250
Will die.

4557
03:21:38,170 --> 03:21:41,030
That means...

4558
03:21:41,830 --> 03:21:42,450
repair...

4559
03:21:42,450 --> 03:21:42,830
It's possible.

4560
03:21:42,830 --> 03:21:43,630
I take...

4561
03:21:43,630 --> 03:21:43,750
That must be offer.

4562
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:44,290
Counseling...

4563
03:21:44,290 --> 03:21:44,550
You know.

4564
03:21:44,690 --> 03:21:44,990
I cient some technology.

4565
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,470
What do we have in here?

4566
03:21:45,470 --> 03:21:46,270
Joss bar them now.

4567
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:47,330
More, more.

4568
03:21:47,410 --> 03:21:47,690
More building materials.

4569
03:21:47,690 --> 03:21:47,910
Like Slippers.

4570
03:21:49,050 --> 03:21:49,790
But Joss?

4571
03:21:50,220 --> 03:21:51,210
There isn't a holding flat.

4572
03:21:51,730 --> 03:21:52,450
I mean...

4573
03:21:52,450 --> 03:21:54,950
Ocelot killed... Master Miller?

4574
03:21:56,250 --> 03:21:56,910
Kazuhiro Miller?

4575
03:21:58,850 --> 03:22:00,930
What are we supposed to call your cat these days?

4576
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:02,290
How do you know I have a cat?

4577
03:22:02,910 --> 03:22:05,870
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna try and give my cat a friend this month.

4578
03:22:07,170 --> 03:22:08,310
It was never explicit.

4579
03:22:08,770 --> 03:22:09,710
It was explicit.

4580
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:11,010
It was implied.

4581
03:22:11,530 --> 03:22:13,970
Yeah, I think it was implied, but it was never like...

4582
03:22:13,970 --> 03:22:19,470
Hi, my name is Ocelot and I'm gonna go to that house and I'm gonna murder him in the dark.

4583
03:22:19,470 --> 03:22:21,210
No, it was a...

4584
03:22:22,440 --> 03:22:25,330
It was a little bit like...

4585
03:22:25,330 --> 03:22:28,970
Yeah, we'll see each other again.

4586
03:22:32,450 --> 03:22:34,390
Oh, my cat!

4587
03:22:37,130 --> 03:22:39,770
That guy is stinky!

4588
03:22:41,010 --> 03:22:42,630
Oh my gosh.

4589
03:22:43,690 --> 03:22:44,670
He...

4590
03:22:45,470 --> 03:22:46,410
Let's see.

4591
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:55,890
Stinky.

4592
03:22:56,770 --> 03:22:59,050
He is very stinky, my cat.

4593
03:22:59,150 --> 03:23:00,810
He's kind of the worst.

4594
03:23:03,970 --> 03:23:04,930
Don't have him!

4595
03:23:05,330 --> 03:23:06,330
He's dirty!

4596
03:23:06,670 --> 03:23:09,010
He went outside and he rolled in the dirt!

4597
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:10,430
Today!

4598
03:23:11,710 --> 03:23:13,050
And all the pollen!

4599
03:23:14,910 --> 03:23:16,750
But, oh my gosh, it was kind of crazy.

4600
03:23:17,150 --> 03:23:21,010
Because I had gotten my cat shaved...

4601
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:22,270
Uh...

4602
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:24,610
A long time ago now.

4603
03:23:24,850 --> 03:23:30,750
I got him shaved because his hair was getting really long and matted and stuff like that.

4604
03:23:30,850 --> 03:23:33,750
So it was like forming knots on his chest.

4605
03:23:33,850 --> 03:23:34,770
He couldn't reach it.

4606
03:23:34,930 --> 03:23:36,530
And to lick it and stuff.

4607
03:23:36,830 --> 03:23:38,030
And so...

4608
03:23:38,980 --> 03:23:39,970
I shaved him.

4609
03:23:40,710 --> 03:23:41,370
And...

4610
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:43,210
After I shaved him...

4611
03:23:43,920 --> 03:23:44,930
He was...

4612
03:23:45,930 --> 03:23:49,950
He was like super scraggly for the longest time.

4613
03:23:49,950 --> 03:23:52,130
Like his hair just was not growing back.

4614
03:23:52,510 --> 03:23:53,650
He uh...

4615
03:23:54,950 --> 03:23:57,410
He had like some patches grow back.

4616
03:23:57,790 --> 03:24:01,170
But like overall his hair was just like...

4617
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:03,990
He looked like an old grandpa.

4618
03:24:06,010 --> 03:24:07,670
Did he look like a sphinx cat?

4619
03:24:07,770 --> 03:24:09,230
No, because he still had hair growing.

4620
03:24:09,350 --> 03:24:10,670
It just was not a lot.

4621
03:24:10,950 --> 03:24:13,450
It was like really ugly and terrible.

4622
03:24:15,290 --> 03:24:16,330
It was like...

4623
03:24:16,330 --> 03:24:17,910
It would like stick up.

4624
03:24:17,970 --> 03:24:18,930
It was just so bad.

4625
03:24:18,930 --> 03:24:22,090
But when I came back from Japan...

4626
03:24:22,090 --> 03:24:22,950
He's...

4627
03:24:22,950 --> 03:24:24,730
So much of his hair grew back.

4628
03:24:25,190 --> 03:24:27,190
I was like all it took was me leaving.

4629
03:24:27,690 --> 03:24:29,790
For him to become...

4630
03:24:29,790 --> 03:24:31,510
A regular cat again.

4631
03:24:31,610 --> 03:24:33,070
And he's like really soft now.

4632
03:24:33,330 --> 03:24:34,190
And I'm like...

4633
03:24:34,190 --> 03:24:38,790
I can finally pet you again without feeling disgusting.

4634
03:24:38,990 --> 03:24:40,610
I was stressing him out.

4635
03:24:40,670 --> 03:24:42,610
Probably because everyday I'm just like...

4636
03:24:42,610 --> 03:24:42,870
Grow!

4637
03:24:43,250 --> 03:24:43,850
Grow!

4638
03:24:44,310 --> 03:24:44,810
Grow!

4639
03:24:46,570 --> 03:24:47,670
And he's like...

4640
03:24:47,670 --> 03:24:49,270
Don't put pressure on me!

4641
03:24:49,810 --> 03:24:51,390
Why are you so mean?

4642
03:24:51,710 --> 03:24:52,310
I...

4643
03:24:52,310 --> 03:24:54,090
I say it lovingly, okay?

4644
03:24:54,310 --> 03:24:55,810
I say it lovingly.

4645
03:25:03,470 --> 03:25:05,870
He was stressed he would shave him again.

4646
03:25:06,010 --> 03:25:06,770
It might have...

4647
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:08,570
It might have actually like...

4648
03:25:08,570 --> 03:25:10,050
Really freaked him out.

4649
03:25:10,130 --> 03:25:10,910
But I...

4650
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:11,690
I mean...

4651
03:25:11,690 --> 03:25:13,210
Having the...

4652
03:25:13,210 --> 03:25:16,090
The knots gone was really important.

4653
03:25:16,210 --> 03:25:17,070
Because that hurts!

4654
03:25:17,070 --> 03:25:18,090
That hurts him!

4655
03:25:18,630 --> 03:25:19,010
So...

4656
03:25:19,950 --> 03:25:20,510
Yeah...

4657
03:25:21,870 --> 03:25:23,670
Hair tonic with the nip.

4658
03:25:23,750 --> 03:25:24,090
Thank you!

4659
03:25:24,150 --> 03:25:24,410
Thank you!

4660
03:25:26,930 --> 03:25:28,050
Hi Mint!

4661
03:25:28,430 --> 03:25:29,750
Thank you for the fun stream!

4662
03:25:29,870 --> 03:25:30,850
Fun fact, Catnip...

4663
03:25:30,850 --> 03:25:33,270
Is in the plant family...

4664
03:25:33,270 --> 03:25:34,230
As Mint!

4665
03:25:34,590 --> 03:25:35,150
Really!

4666
03:25:37,710 --> 03:25:40,630
Is that why you guys are so addicted to me?

4667
03:25:45,090 --> 03:25:45,650
Obsessed.

4668
03:25:45,650 --> 03:25:47,870
You guys are obsessed with me.

4669
03:25:49,450 --> 03:25:50,170
Thank you!

4670
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:50,530
Thank you!

4671
03:25:50,790 --> 03:25:51,090
Bye!

4672
03:25:51,850 --> 03:25:56,430
The awkward in between phase applies in for other species.

4673
03:25:56,530 --> 03:25:56,990
Crazy.

4674
03:25:57,850 --> 03:26:01,250
Yeah, he felt like he was like going through a strange puberty.

4675
03:26:02,370 --> 03:26:03,590
But he's all good now.

4676
03:26:05,050 --> 03:26:05,710
Yeah, yeah.

4677
03:26:06,730 --> 03:26:07,470
Yeah, yeah.

4678
03:26:07,470 --> 03:26:08,130
He's all good now.

4679
03:26:09,510 --> 03:26:10,170
It's not...

4680
03:26:10,170 --> 03:26:12,290
His hair is not as fluffy as before, but that's fine.

4681
03:26:12,390 --> 03:26:15,150
Because if it were, then it would be getting knotted again.

4682
03:26:15,210 --> 03:26:15,630
So...

4683
03:26:16,770 --> 03:26:17,170
Yeah!

4684
03:26:17,830 --> 03:26:18,550
Yeah, yeah.

4685
03:26:21,330 --> 03:26:24,210
Maybe we need to add cat ears to the wisp design.

4686
03:26:27,270 --> 03:26:28,570
Maybe we need to...

4687
03:26:32,450 --> 03:26:33,690
You're a simp.

4688
03:26:33,710 --> 03:26:34,410
A simp.

4689
03:26:35,070 --> 03:26:36,850
I hope to see you at off-camp Mint!

4690
03:26:36,990 --> 03:26:39,470
Would love to show you my Ace Combat merch with you though.

4691
03:26:39,630 --> 03:26:40,230
Oh my gosh, yes!

4692
03:26:42,130 --> 03:26:42,530
Wait...

4693
03:26:43,250 --> 03:26:44,150
Do you have a lot?

4694
03:26:44,570 --> 03:26:45,610
It might be a lot to show you.

4695
03:26:45,610 --> 03:26:46,210
It might be a lot to bring, right?

4696
03:26:46,830 --> 03:26:47,250
Okay.

4697
03:26:47,870 --> 03:26:48,290
My...

4698
03:26:51,150 --> 03:26:52,470
Do you have a friend in mind?

4699
03:26:52,630 --> 03:26:53,010
No.

4700
03:26:53,590 --> 03:26:54,370
I do not.

4701
03:26:55,190 --> 03:26:57,790
But basically like yesterday, I decided it.

4702
03:26:57,810 --> 03:26:59,810
I was like, okay, this month is going to be the month.

4703
03:27:00,050 --> 03:27:01,930
I have to get him a friend this month.

4704
03:27:02,430 --> 03:27:03,310
I don't know why.

4705
03:27:03,630 --> 03:27:04,030
Hmm.

4706
03:27:04,730 --> 03:27:06,730
I don't know why, but like it's...

4707
03:27:06,730 --> 03:27:10,310
I've been trying to get him a friend for a really long time, so...

4708
03:27:11,410 --> 03:27:11,830
Um...

4709
03:27:11,830 --> 03:27:12,650
Okay.

4710
03:27:13,190 --> 03:27:13,610
Okay.

4711
03:27:15,170 --> 03:27:15,590
Okay.

4712
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:23,000
I think I'm going to stick with Wisps.

4713
03:27:27,260 --> 03:27:31,300
I think I just decided, because I've already said Wisps several times now.

4714
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:41,100
Are you still thinking about this?

4715
03:27:42,180 --> 03:27:42,660
Sorry.

4716
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:44,420
I'm an over-thinker.

4717
03:27:45,060 --> 03:27:45,540
Okay.

4718
03:27:45,880 --> 03:27:46,760
Get out of here.

4719
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,720
I like Fantomys too, but...

4720
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:51,400
I have an idea.

4721
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:53,060
Yeah, I have an idea.

4722
03:27:54,460 --> 03:28:01,060
Wait, actually, I don't know if I'll have my old settings for memberships.

4723
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,080
Greatest anime betrayal.

4724
03:28:11,760 --> 03:28:13,300
Yeah, I think wisps are cute.

4725
03:28:14,180 --> 03:28:16,960
I can be like, you guys are my little wisps.

4726
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:21,260
It's simple enough that it's fine.

4727
03:28:21,720 --> 03:28:24,420
Even though it's like just a regular word, but that's okay.

4728
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:26,440
It's okay, it's okay.

4729
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:28,080
Do both?

4730
03:28:28,300 --> 03:28:29,080
No, no, no.

4731
03:28:29,340 --> 03:28:31,480
That's why I was so conflicted to begin with.

4732
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:33,080
Because I already had multiple stuff.

4733
03:28:34,120 --> 03:28:35,300
It's like calling cats.

4734
03:28:41,380 --> 03:28:43,020
Oh my gosh, it's perfect!

4735
03:28:43,200 --> 03:28:44,860
And we can put cat ears on you guys for real!

4736
03:28:49,490 --> 03:28:50,250
Oh my god.

4737
03:28:51,250 --> 03:28:52,030
It's perfect!

4738
03:28:53,830 --> 03:28:54,990
Now I feel so much better.

4739
03:29:03,710 --> 03:29:05,750
My cat's looking here now.

4740
03:29:14,890 --> 03:29:16,690
Yeah, it's perfect.

4741
03:29:17,610 --> 03:29:18,250
So cute.

4742
03:29:29,170 --> 03:29:30,890
For your YouTube kittens.

4743
03:29:31,930 --> 03:29:33,850
Come here, my little YouTube kitten.

4744
03:29:34,290 --> 03:29:35,250
What is that noise?

4745
03:29:35,990 --> 03:29:36,470
What?

4746
03:29:40,490 --> 03:29:41,190
Oh my god.

4747
03:29:41,470 --> 03:29:43,790
Not safe for work, Takumi.

4748
03:29:44,750 --> 03:29:45,710
NSF Wisps.

4749
03:29:47,490 --> 03:29:48,690
That's kind of funny too.

4750
03:29:51,890 --> 03:29:53,010
I'll think about it.

4751
03:29:53,110 --> 03:29:54,030
I'll think about it.

4752
03:29:54,050 --> 03:29:54,690
I'll think about it.

4753
03:29:54,690 --> 03:29:55,330
I'll think about it.

4754
03:30:04,130 --> 03:30:04,810
Hold on.

4755
03:30:09,550 --> 03:30:11,930
I just realized I had a message.

4756
03:30:27,430 --> 03:30:30,130
Do you know what you're going to make your member icons?

4757
03:30:30,390 --> 03:30:31,210
Or do you already have one?

4758
03:30:31,290 --> 03:30:32,570
I already have stuff.

4759
03:30:32,970 --> 03:30:35,030
I'm hoping that YouTube will...

4760
03:30:35,890 --> 03:30:38,730
Has saved my old stuff.

4761
03:30:38,730 --> 03:30:40,390
I think I still have it though.

4762
03:30:42,550 --> 03:30:43,470
From before.

4763
03:30:44,830 --> 03:30:53,630
But I'm hoping that they saved it so that when I turn monetization back on, it's all the same.

4764
03:30:55,290 --> 03:30:58,470
Otherwise, it's going to be a little annoying, I think.

4765
03:30:59,590 --> 03:31:00,930
I don't trust YouTube.

4766
03:31:01,490 --> 03:31:02,130
You know what?

4767
03:31:02,430 --> 03:31:03,870
I don't know if I do either.

4768
03:31:04,510 --> 03:31:05,930
It could all be wiped.

4769
03:31:07,010 --> 03:31:08,130
If that's the case...

4770
03:31:09,450 --> 03:31:10,330
Wait, like...

4771
03:31:10,330 --> 03:31:11,670
Where even is my...

4772
03:31:11,670 --> 03:31:11,990
Okay.

4773
03:31:12,090 --> 03:31:12,850
Wait, emotes?

4774
03:31:13,310 --> 03:31:14,890
Okay, I have my emotes.

4775
03:31:17,650 --> 03:31:19,990
I don't know where my...

4776
03:31:21,250 --> 03:31:25,430
I don't know where the membership, like, tier pictures are.

4777
03:31:25,990 --> 03:31:27,370
Maybe I don't have those anymore.

4778
03:31:27,970 --> 03:31:28,550
Uh oh.

4779
03:31:28,990 --> 03:31:30,130
But I still have my emotes.

4780
03:31:30,610 --> 03:31:31,810
If you guys want to see them.

4781
03:31:34,670 --> 03:31:35,790
They're quite old.

4782
03:31:35,790 --> 03:31:36,490
So they're...

4783
03:31:37,590 --> 03:31:37,930
They're...

4784
03:31:37,930 --> 03:31:38,690
They're quite old.

4785
03:31:38,790 --> 03:31:41,190
So they're of, like, my older model.

4786
03:31:42,070 --> 03:31:43,430
But I have this one.

4787
03:31:43,990 --> 03:31:44,270
Pien.

4788
03:31:45,430 --> 03:31:46,110
Pien.

4789
03:31:46,290 --> 03:31:46,830
Pien.

4790
03:31:47,030 --> 03:31:47,370
Pien.

4791
03:31:49,050 --> 03:31:50,410
I have...

4792
03:31:51,670 --> 03:31:52,590
This one.

4793
03:31:53,370 --> 03:31:54,050
Doya.

4794
03:31:54,510 --> 03:31:54,850
Doya.

4795
03:31:55,470 --> 03:31:56,570
Your soup.

4796
03:31:58,690 --> 03:32:00,050
Fan name is Wisp.

4797
03:32:00,170 --> 03:32:01,310
No ghosticles.

4798
03:32:01,450 --> 03:32:01,790
Stop!

4799
03:32:03,610 --> 03:32:04,290
Cease.

4800
03:32:05,290 --> 03:32:05,890
Cease.

4801
03:32:09,070 --> 03:32:09,670
Doya.

4802
03:32:09,870 --> 03:32:10,470
Doya.

4803
03:32:11,150 --> 03:32:13,250
I have this one.

4804
03:32:13,950 --> 03:32:14,290
Yeah!

4805
03:32:14,590 --> 03:32:15,190
Zinzo.

4806
03:32:15,270 --> 03:32:15,590
Bye.

4807
03:32:15,670 --> 03:32:16,210
Ama Ibu.

4808
03:32:16,290 --> 03:32:16,590
Aipa.

4809
03:32:17,870 --> 03:32:19,790
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dai-i-ga.

4810
03:32:19,890 --> 03:32:20,630
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

4811
03:32:24,300 --> 03:32:25,880
I have...

4812
03:32:25,880 --> 03:32:34,300
I have...

4813
03:32:34,300 --> 03:32:34,940
W.

4814
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:36,280
I love you.

4815
03:32:37,220 --> 03:32:38,360
I love you.

4816
03:32:38,600 --> 03:32:40,540
I have...

4817
03:32:40,540 --> 03:32:42,940
I have...

4818
03:32:50,610 --> 03:32:51,940
Oh god!

4819
03:32:57,330 --> 03:32:57,980
Wait.

4820
03:32:59,070 --> 03:33:00,380
I have...

4821
03:33:00,380 --> 03:33:03,320
What is that?

4822
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:04,980
A master has...

4823
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:07,540
A master has...

4824
03:33:07,540 --> 03:33:08,560
gone outside.

4825
03:33:08,640 --> 03:33:10,040
I don't remember what...

4826
03:33:13,940 --> 03:33:15,780
I have...

4827
03:33:25,460 --> 03:33:27,860
And I have...

4828
03:33:35,560 --> 03:33:36,480
Wait.

4829
03:33:36,680 --> 03:33:37,400
This is just...

4830
03:33:37,540 --> 03:33:39,600
This is literally...

4831
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:45,540
This is... this is just...

4832
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:53,320
Oh, but opposite.

4833
03:33:55,560 --> 03:33:56,200
See?

4834
03:33:56,420 --> 03:33:58,040
Some things truly never change.

4835
03:33:58,940 --> 03:34:00,180
Can I bite my lip?

4836
03:34:11,600 --> 03:34:12,120
Hold on.

4837
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:13,200
Hold on.

4838
03:34:14,600 --> 03:34:15,080
Hold on.

4839
03:34:15,300 --> 03:34:16,340
I think I can...

4840
03:34:18,590 --> 03:34:19,070
Oh, wait.

4841
03:34:22,170 --> 03:34:22,890
Hold on.

4842
03:34:37,350 --> 03:34:37,710
Wait.

4843
03:34:37,710 --> 03:34:38,630
No, I'm just smiling.

4844
03:34:43,730 --> 03:34:44,490
I'm just smiling.

4845
03:34:44,490 --> 03:34:45,170
I'm just smiling.

4846
03:34:45,710 --> 03:34:45,730
I'm just smiling.

4847
03:34:46,670 --> 03:34:48,510
I'm just smiling.

4848
03:34:50,290 --> 03:34:52,610
Will we get chili mint...

4849
03:34:52,610 --> 03:34:53,690
back during Halloween?

4850
03:34:54,450 --> 03:34:55,210
Maybe.

4851
03:34:56,430 --> 03:34:58,010
If I'm feeling spicy.

4852
03:34:58,850 --> 03:35:00,170
If I'm feeling spicy.

4853
03:35:01,550 --> 03:35:02,310
Yeah.

4854
03:35:02,510 --> 03:35:03,270
Yeah.

4855
03:35:03,270 --> 03:35:03,390
Yeah.

4856
03:35:07,750 --> 03:35:08,570
Chili mint.

4857
03:35:10,110 --> 03:35:11,210
Struggles to bite lip.

4858
03:35:20,410 --> 03:35:20,930
I...

4859
03:35:20,930 --> 03:35:22,410
I thought I could bite my lip.

4860
03:35:25,090 --> 03:35:26,450
No, I'm just smiling.

4861
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:30,530
I'm just smiling.

4862
03:35:31,130 --> 03:35:31,830
Oh well.

4863
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:32,810
Yeah.

4864
03:35:33,270 --> 03:35:33,770
And then...

4865
03:35:33,770 --> 03:35:37,230
I had some more...

4866
03:35:37,230 --> 03:35:38,390
that Emory did.

4867
03:35:39,490 --> 03:35:41,610
But I don't know where they are.

4868
03:35:43,250 --> 03:35:43,930
But I don't know where they are.

4869
03:35:43,930 --> 03:35:44,630
Maybe they're in a...

4870
03:35:44,630 --> 03:35:45,790
hidden folder.

4871
03:35:48,910 --> 03:35:51,130
I have almost everything.

4872
03:35:52,050 --> 03:35:52,690
I have almost everything.

4873
03:35:52,690 --> 03:35:53,250
So...

4874
03:35:55,850 --> 03:35:57,490
I'm working on a newer version.

4875
03:35:57,650 --> 03:35:58,570
Wait, no!

4876
03:36:00,010 --> 03:36:00,690
Actually...

4877
03:36:01,270 --> 03:36:02,230
Are you sure?

4878
03:36:04,590 --> 03:36:05,110
Yeah.

4879
03:36:05,110 --> 03:36:06,370
Oh, and if anybody wants it...

4880
03:36:06,370 --> 03:36:07,750
This is the old one.

4881
03:36:10,850 --> 03:36:12,030
My old headband.

4882
03:36:16,700 --> 03:36:17,500
There you go.

4883
03:36:18,660 --> 03:36:20,080
It's like nothing has changed.

4884
03:36:24,660 --> 03:36:25,180
Yay.

4885
03:36:26,720 --> 03:36:27,440
Oh, wait.

4886
03:36:27,520 --> 03:36:27,880
Hold on.

4887
03:36:27,900 --> 03:36:28,920
I can actually...

4888
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:31,040
Oh, gosh.

4889
03:36:31,240 --> 03:36:32,960
Oh, my gosh.

4890
03:36:34,740 --> 03:36:35,380
I can.

4891
03:36:35,580 --> 03:36:36,200
I can.

4892
03:36:36,540 --> 03:36:37,260
I can.

4893
03:36:37,680 --> 03:36:38,180
I can.

4894
03:36:38,180 --> 03:36:38,480
One second.

4895
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:39,480
I can.

4896
03:36:42,460 --> 03:36:42,940
Here.

4897
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:48,060
Put it on you guys.

4898
03:36:48,140 --> 03:36:48,680
You want it on?

4899
03:36:57,770 --> 03:37:00,350
I lost my Ahoge because I'm not an idiot.

4900
03:37:01,770 --> 03:37:02,390
Let's see.

4901
03:37:04,390 --> 03:37:05,370
Oh, wait.

4902
03:37:06,190 --> 03:37:07,590
I don't know how to...

4903
03:37:07,590 --> 03:37:08,330
Wait.

4904
03:37:09,010 --> 03:37:10,570
I don't know how to...

4905
03:37:14,010 --> 03:37:14,590
Oh.

4906
03:37:17,430 --> 03:37:18,010
Wait.

4907
03:37:18,370 --> 03:37:21,390
L M N O P Q R...

4908
03:37:21,390 --> 03:37:22,210
There, I found it.

4909
03:37:31,290 --> 03:37:32,410
It's kind of...

4910
03:37:32,410 --> 03:37:34,030
It works a little bit.

4911
03:37:36,570 --> 03:37:37,730
We're matching!

4912
03:37:38,070 --> 03:37:38,650
We're matching!

4913
03:37:41,570 --> 03:37:42,450
We're matching.

4914
03:37:42,710 --> 03:37:42,930
We're matching.

4915
03:37:42,930 --> 03:37:43,150
Wait.

4916
03:37:43,170 --> 03:37:44,870
Maybe if I make it a little bit bigger.

4917
03:37:45,670 --> 03:37:46,970
I don't know how to turn it.

4918
03:37:47,130 --> 03:37:47,310
Wait.

4919
03:37:47,330 --> 03:37:48,010
How can I turn it?

4920
03:37:48,350 --> 03:37:49,510
Is there a way to turn it?

4921
03:37:52,750 --> 03:37:54,330
I don't know how to turn it.

4922
03:37:56,190 --> 03:37:56,830
This works.

4923
03:37:57,090 --> 03:37:57,610
I guess.

4924
03:38:02,330 --> 03:38:02,770
Yippee!

4925
03:38:06,030 --> 03:38:06,730
Slay, sister.

4926
03:38:08,150 --> 03:38:08,590
Slay.

4927
03:38:08,590 --> 03:38:09,030
Control?

4928
03:38:13,740 --> 03:38:14,380
Oh!

4929
03:38:14,740 --> 03:38:15,800
I got it.

4930
03:38:15,900 --> 03:38:16,700
Thank you.

4931
03:38:16,720 --> 03:38:17,560
That actually worked.

4932
03:38:19,060 --> 03:38:20,080
There we go!

4933
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:21,660
It's a little bit better.

4934
03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:29,090
Aha!

4935
03:38:35,710 --> 03:38:36,990
So cute.

4936
03:38:37,150 --> 03:38:37,910
Extra Lacy.

4937
03:38:38,190 --> 03:38:38,610
Yeah!

4938
03:38:38,750 --> 03:38:39,790
Extra Lacy.

4939
03:38:42,570 --> 03:38:44,450
And it's got my old ghost.

4940
03:38:45,350 --> 03:38:46,110
New ghost.

4941
03:38:46,330 --> 03:38:46,930
This is you.

4942
03:38:48,270 --> 03:38:49,370
This one right here.

4943
03:38:50,230 --> 03:38:51,890
Well, not you exactly.

4944
03:38:55,230 --> 03:38:56,730
Is he moving on his own?

4945
03:38:58,810 --> 03:38:59,310
Oh!

4946
03:38:59,850 --> 03:39:01,730
I think he's actually a ghost.

4947
03:39:07,400 --> 03:39:08,800
I think he's actually a ghost.

4948
03:39:09,260 --> 03:39:10,160
No, there's a...

4949
03:39:10,160 --> 03:39:10,520
Hold on.

4950
03:39:10,600 --> 03:39:12,000
I have the wisp.

4951
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:13,700
I have the wisp design.

4952
03:39:14,020 --> 03:39:14,520
Still.

4953
03:39:16,580 --> 03:39:17,080
Uh...

4954
03:39:18,400 --> 03:39:19,160
Hold on.

4955
03:39:19,680 --> 03:39:20,460
Hold on.

4956
03:39:21,340 --> 03:39:22,140
Hold on.

4957
03:39:23,080 --> 03:39:23,820
Hold on.

4958
03:39:25,420 --> 03:39:26,540
Please hold!

4959
03:39:29,340 --> 03:39:30,160
Please hold.

4960
03:39:30,840 --> 03:39:31,400
Wait.

4961
03:39:31,500 --> 03:39:31,980
It's somewhere.

4962
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:34,500
Where did I save it?

4963
03:39:34,900 --> 03:39:36,380
Why can't I find anything?

4964
03:39:36,980 --> 03:39:37,540
Ever.

4965
03:39:37,940 --> 03:39:39,540
Why am I so unorganized?

4966
03:39:40,520 --> 03:39:41,080
Holding?

4967
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:43,160
Yes.

4968
03:39:43,320 --> 03:39:43,660
Hold.

4969
03:39:43,760 --> 03:39:44,060
Hold.

4970
03:39:44,140 --> 03:39:44,400
Hold.

4971
03:39:44,480 --> 03:39:44,780
Oh!

4972
03:39:44,820 --> 03:39:45,120
Oh!

4973
03:39:45,160 --> 03:39:45,380
Oh!

4974
03:39:45,400 --> 03:39:45,680
Oh!

4975
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:46,100
Oh!

4976
03:39:48,530 --> 03:39:50,770
Maya, I hope it's okay if I show these.

4977
03:39:52,370 --> 03:39:53,970
This is so long ago.

4978
03:39:54,570 --> 03:39:55,430
Oh my gosh.

4979
03:39:56,170 --> 03:39:56,730
So...

4980
03:39:58,550 --> 03:40:00,170
Um... Yes, of course.

4981
03:40:00,510 --> 03:40:02,910
Okay, so the left is what I drew.

4982
03:40:03,310 --> 03:40:05,270
What kind of outfit I was thinking.

4983
03:40:05,690 --> 03:40:06,850
What kind of outfit I was thinking.

4984
03:40:06,850 --> 03:40:07,630
And Maya!

4985
03:40:07,950 --> 03:40:14,710
For those who don't know, Maya actually helped come up with the way I look now for my second outfit.

4986
03:40:15,030 --> 03:40:18,410
So she actually came up with it.

4987
03:40:18,810 --> 03:40:19,410
Uh...

4988
03:40:20,210 --> 03:40:21,530
So this right here.

4989
03:40:22,650 --> 03:40:25,250
This little guy there is you.

4990
03:40:26,170 --> 03:40:27,450
That one right there.

4991
03:40:27,610 --> 03:40:28,350
That one.

4992
03:40:28,490 --> 03:40:30,130
On my right.

4993
03:40:31,650 --> 03:40:32,250
Yeah.

4994
03:40:33,290 --> 03:40:33,890
So...

4995
03:40:35,190 --> 03:40:39,810
I'm so grateful to Maya because she gave me so many...

4996
03:40:39,810 --> 03:40:45,910
I sent her my ugly stupid poopy drawing and she made it look so perfect and cute.

4997
03:40:46,210 --> 03:40:47,570
I was so happy.

4998
03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:49,350
Needs cat ears stat.

4999
03:40:49,530 --> 03:40:51,250
Yeah, we'll add cat ears too.

5000
03:40:51,430 --> 03:40:52,170
So you can be...

5001
03:40:53,070 --> 03:40:53,630
Yeah.

5002
03:40:56,730 --> 03:40:57,290
Um...

5003
03:40:57,290 --> 03:41:00,410
She made everything look so perfect and cute.

5004
03:41:00,710 --> 03:41:04,650
There were so many designs that here I...

5005
03:41:04,650 --> 03:41:06,130
Is it okay if I show...

5006
03:41:06,130 --> 03:41:08,010
I don't know if I ever showed these before.

5007
03:41:08,530 --> 03:41:10,610
I can't remember to be honest.

5008
03:41:12,090 --> 03:41:12,650
Um...

5009
03:41:13,810 --> 03:41:15,490
I think I sent.

5010
03:41:16,070 --> 03:41:17,010
Feel free to.

5011
03:41:17,150 --> 03:41:17,470
Okay.

5012
03:41:17,470 --> 03:41:18,010
Thank you.

5013
03:41:18,030 --> 03:41:18,590
I love you.

5014
03:41:18,610 --> 03:41:19,730
I love you, Maya!

5015
03:41:20,250 --> 03:41:23,110
Looking forward to the mint organizes her hard drive stream.

5016
03:41:24,010 --> 03:41:24,990
Yeah, for real.

5017
03:41:26,070 --> 03:41:27,530
So I gave...

5018
03:41:27,530 --> 03:41:28,330
Oh, these two.

5019
03:41:28,390 --> 03:41:28,890
Oh, gosh.

5020
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:30,150
The left one is so cringe.

5021
03:41:30,450 --> 03:41:30,930
I can't...

5022
03:41:30,930 --> 03:41:32,850
Art is so bad.

5023
03:41:33,770 --> 03:41:34,730
Oh, God.

5024
03:41:34,850 --> 03:41:35,730
Okay, don't look at it.

5025
03:41:35,830 --> 03:41:37,650
But she gave me so many variations.

5026
03:41:37,850 --> 03:41:39,630
Like, look at all these hair styles.

5027
03:41:40,350 --> 03:41:41,830
And dress styles.

5028
03:41:43,110 --> 03:41:43,590
And...

5029
03:41:43,810 --> 03:41:44,790
Um...

5030
03:41:44,790 --> 03:41:47,310
I think I ultimately settled on ten.

5031
03:41:47,750 --> 03:41:49,430
As you can tell.

5032
03:41:49,770 --> 03:41:51,950
But there's so many.

5033
03:41:53,030 --> 03:41:53,670
Um...

5034
03:41:53,670 --> 03:41:55,130
I also really like six.

5035
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:57,250
I think it's so cute.

5036
03:41:57,970 --> 03:41:59,010
So, uh...

5037
03:41:59,710 --> 03:42:00,350
Yeah.

5038
03:42:01,470 --> 03:42:02,110
So...

5039
03:42:03,610 --> 03:42:04,290
So many.

5040
03:42:05,610 --> 03:42:07,570
But definitely, um...

5041
03:42:07,570 --> 03:42:08,450
Three.

5042
03:42:08,730 --> 03:42:09,790
Three is really cute.

5043
03:42:09,890 --> 03:42:11,710
Five is really... Wait, I think five and...

5044
03:42:11,710 --> 03:42:12,330
Oh, no.

5045
03:42:12,410 --> 03:42:13,390
Five and six are...

5046
03:42:13,810 --> 03:42:14,390
Just a little different.

5047
03:42:14,850 --> 03:42:15,990
Those are longer.

5048
03:42:16,470 --> 03:42:18,750
But I ended up really loving the wavy hair.

5049
03:42:19,710 --> 03:42:20,750
So... Yeah.

5050
03:42:21,910 --> 03:42:23,250
Six had the old hairstyle.

5051
03:42:24,810 --> 03:42:25,310
Uh...

5052
03:42:25,310 --> 03:42:26,150
A little.

5053
03:42:26,410 --> 03:42:27,630
It's just, uh...

5054
03:42:27,630 --> 03:42:29,010
Yeah, it's my old hairstyle.

5055
03:42:29,090 --> 03:42:31,890
But with the twin tails on the sides.

5056
03:42:32,590 --> 03:42:33,310
Mm-mm.

5057
03:42:35,030 --> 03:42:35,550
And...

5058
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:38,750
Uh, it's kind of similar to this one that I drew, too.

5059
03:42:39,970 --> 03:42:40,490
Um...

5060
03:42:40,490 --> 03:42:42,730
With, like, the little hair sticking out.

5061
03:42:44,750 --> 03:42:45,570
And, uh...

5062
03:42:45,570 --> 03:42:45,930
Yeah.

5063
03:42:46,130 --> 03:42:47,750
One day I'll grow my hair out.

5064
03:42:48,290 --> 03:42:48,770
Eventually.

5065
03:42:51,470 --> 03:42:53,210
The wavy hair was so last minute.

5066
03:42:53,310 --> 03:42:54,790
So I'm glad you liked it the most.

5067
03:42:54,890 --> 03:42:55,130
Yeah!

5068
03:42:56,690 --> 03:42:57,530
Thank you!

5069
03:42:58,990 --> 03:43:00,650
You're a genius, Maya.

5070
03:43:00,750 --> 03:43:01,270
You're a genius.

5071
03:43:03,230 --> 03:43:04,510
Little hair pokies.

5072
03:43:09,050 --> 03:43:10,210
Long hair mint.

5073
03:43:10,810 --> 03:43:11,290
Yeah.

5074
03:43:12,050 --> 03:43:12,130
Maybe?

5075
03:43:12,410 --> 03:43:13,250
Who knows?

5076
03:43:13,730 --> 03:43:15,610
Can ghosts even grow longer?

5077
03:43:17,890 --> 03:43:22,790
Oh, go- Can ghost hair even grow- Yeah!

5078
03:43:23,030 --> 03:43:23,810
Of course!

5079
03:43:24,930 --> 03:43:26,310
I just have to...

5080
03:43:26,310 --> 03:43:27,410
Um, you know...

5081
03:43:28,010 --> 03:43:30,190
I just have to consume more life force.

5082
03:43:30,450 --> 03:43:31,530
And then, uh...

5083
03:43:31,530 --> 03:43:33,110
Do you wear wigs?

5084
03:43:33,630 --> 03:43:35,330
Will you wear wigs?

5085
03:43:36,770 --> 03:43:37,330
Yeah.

5086
03:43:37,410 --> 03:43:39,070
I just have to consume more life force.

5087
03:43:39,150 --> 03:43:40,550
And then, um...

5088
03:43:42,050 --> 03:43:42,390
Easy peasy.

5089
03:43:42,970 --> 03:43:44,390
Increase the ectoplasm.

5090
03:43:44,430 --> 03:43:44,970
Exactly!

5091
03:43:45,650 --> 03:43:46,250
Exactly.

5092
03:43:50,590 --> 03:43:51,190
So...

5093
03:43:52,670 --> 03:43:53,750
Maybe one day.

5094
03:43:53,850 --> 03:43:54,350
We'll see.

5095
03:43:55,070 --> 03:43:57,530
We shall see.

5096
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:07,640
Us Momo already offered ourselves one so we could do it again.

5097
03:44:09,940 --> 03:44:13,380
Us Momo already offered ourselves one so we could do it again.

5098
03:44:13,380 --> 03:44:13,400
Us Momo already offered ourselves one so we could do it again.

5099
03:44:13,400 --> 03:44:15,720
Getting Momos to sacrifice themselves to summon me?

5100
03:44:15,780 --> 03:44:16,420
I was like, wow.

5101
03:44:17,760 --> 03:44:19,040
I'm feasting!

5102
03:44:21,220 --> 03:44:27,640
My friend Rifticus is- I remember Rifticus is bawling over that there are no ponytails.

5103
03:44:28,460 --> 03:44:29,460
Not yet!

5104
03:44:29,580 --> 03:44:31,080
Not with that attitude.

5105
03:44:33,660 --> 03:44:34,300
Gosh.

5106
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:40,400
Are we tasty?

5107
03:44:40,400 --> 03:44:41,820
Momos?

5108
03:44:45,220 --> 03:44:46,100
Yeah.

5109
03:44:49,200 --> 03:44:50,080
Yeah.

5110
03:44:50,080 --> 03:44:50,140
Yeah.

5111
03:44:50,140 --> 03:44:51,160
Yeah, the momos were delicious.

5112
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:55,320
You're awesome.

5113
03:44:58,180 --> 03:44:59,160
You're awesome.

5114
03:45:01,640 --> 03:45:03,340
Thank you for the donut.

5115
03:45:03,880 --> 03:45:04,120
Thank you for the donut.

5116
03:45:04,400 --> 03:45:05,980
She hates us.

5117
03:45:06,420 --> 03:45:07,160
She hates us.

5118
03:45:07,220 --> 03:45:09,860
She hates us.

5119
03:45:09,860 --> 03:45:12,360
She hates us.

5120
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:12,780
Ugh.

5121
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:14,100
But yeah.

5122
03:45:14,360 --> 03:45:16,280
It still feels very weird to...

5123
03:45:17,320 --> 03:45:18,060
be here.

5124
03:45:18,820 --> 03:45:21,220
It feels very strange.

5125
03:45:21,580 --> 03:45:22,440
But that's okay.

5126
03:45:23,340 --> 03:45:24,400
I'll get used to it.

5127
03:45:24,780 --> 03:45:25,440
I'm sure.

5128
03:45:27,200 --> 03:45:28,240
And hopefully...

5129
03:45:30,180 --> 03:45:31,500
Hopefully you guys stick around.

5130
03:45:31,860 --> 03:45:33,180
We can all hang out still.

5131
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:35,140
And, you know, have a good time.

5132
03:45:37,020 --> 03:45:38,900
And hopefully you guys enjoy the podcast.

5133
03:45:38,900 --> 03:45:40,180
And, uh...

5134
03:45:41,280 --> 03:45:42,080
I simp!

5135
03:45:43,460 --> 03:45:44,220
Oh wait, sorry.

5136
03:45:44,320 --> 03:45:45,140
I was reading...

5137
03:45:45,140 --> 03:45:47,640
I realized I was reading that last donut.

5138
03:45:48,340 --> 03:45:49,660
But I never said it out loud.

5139
03:45:49,960 --> 03:45:51,020
I can honestly...

5140
03:45:51,020 --> 03:45:52,500
Oh my gosh, thank you for all the donuts!

5141
03:45:53,080 --> 03:45:59,420
I can honestly already imagine the fanart of you floating in a moonlit night in the middle of a forest with my cat ears.

5142
03:45:59,600 --> 03:46:00,720
Wait, I don't have the cat ears.

5143
03:46:00,800 --> 03:46:01,480
You have the cat ears.

5144
03:46:01,880 --> 03:46:04,240
Surrounded by dozens of different colored glowing whiskers.

5145
03:46:04,240 --> 03:46:05,980
With your own cat ears whiskers.

5146
03:46:06,400 --> 03:46:07,820
Oh, with our own cat ears.

5147
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:11,480
Like Slime Rancher.

5148
03:46:15,080 --> 03:46:18,540
The Momo-wisp path seems like it works.

5149
03:46:18,960 --> 03:46:21,200
Tara gets to eat the body and mint the soul.

5150
03:46:22,940 --> 03:46:23,460
Yeah!

5151
03:46:24,040 --> 03:46:26,960
It's a parasocial relationship.

5152
03:46:28,660 --> 03:46:30,660
Cashing in some life force for twin tails.

5153
03:46:33,160 --> 03:46:35,380
Can we get Hime cut twin tails?

5154
03:46:35,560 --> 03:46:36,020
Oh my gosh.

5155
03:46:38,900 --> 03:46:39,580
Um...

5156
03:46:40,520 --> 03:46:41,660
Oh sorry, yes.

5157
03:46:41,740 --> 03:46:43,020
Symbiotic relationship.

5158
03:46:43,460 --> 03:46:45,360
A paranormal relationship.

5159
03:46:50,540 --> 03:46:51,620
Parasitic relationship.

5160
03:46:53,140 --> 03:46:54,260
My...

5161
03:46:54,260 --> 03:46:58,360
My last outfit was a little...

5162
03:46:58,900 --> 03:47:01,160
Was a little...

5163
03:47:01,160 --> 03:47:01,920
Uh...

5164
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:02,900
What's the word?

5165
03:47:05,860 --> 03:47:06,980
Um...

5166
03:47:06,980 --> 03:47:09,340
It was meant to be a Hime cut.

5167
03:47:10,300 --> 03:47:12,040
I wonder if that came across.

5168
03:47:12,820 --> 03:47:13,560
Kind of.

5169
03:47:13,840 --> 03:47:16,660
It was Hime cut but with short hair.

5170
03:47:17,120 --> 03:47:19,520
But maybe it didn't come across as a Hime cut.

5171
03:47:19,620 --> 03:47:20,020
I'm not sure.

5172
03:47:21,940 --> 03:47:24,520
I've saved so much money while you were gone.

5173
03:47:24,740 --> 03:47:25,100
Oh no!

5174
03:47:25,380 --> 03:47:26,280
Keep saving!

5175
03:47:28,140 --> 03:47:29,800
Cat tails is glow sticks.

5176
03:47:31,080 --> 03:47:31,600
What?

5177
03:47:32,840 --> 03:47:34,660
You're like waving your tails around?

5178
03:47:34,660 --> 03:47:35,540
That's kind of crazy.

5179
03:47:40,540 --> 03:47:42,700
My last outfit here or in heaven?

5180
03:47:42,880 --> 03:47:43,040
Oh!

5181
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:44,800
My last outfit here.

5182
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:47,320
This one.

5183
03:47:48,480 --> 03:47:49,400
Jump scare!

5184
03:48:01,940 --> 03:48:02,740
It's so funny.

5185
03:48:02,960 --> 03:48:04,520
She came out of nowhere!

5186
03:48:04,840 --> 03:48:05,620
Oh my god!

5187
03:48:11,780 --> 03:48:13,700
Old mint jump scare.

5188
03:48:14,140 --> 03:48:15,500
What are you...

5189
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:18,360
What are you doing here?

5190
03:48:19,840 --> 03:48:21,820
I thought I killed you.

5191
03:48:22,800 --> 03:48:23,920
Why are you here?

5192
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:25,840
What do you want?

5193
03:48:25,980 --> 03:48:27,320
What do you want, old mint?

5194
03:48:36,480 --> 03:48:37,560
Funny old.

5195
03:48:39,960 --> 03:48:40,500
Old!

5196
03:48:41,980 --> 03:48:42,660
But yeah.

5197
03:48:42,940 --> 03:48:43,940
I don't know.

5198
03:48:43,960 --> 03:48:45,960
You can kind of maybe tell that it's a Hime cut.

5199
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:46,940
Maybe.

5200
03:48:49,980 --> 03:48:51,700
Mint 1.0, my beloved.

5201
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:53,800
Yeah.

5202
03:48:56,280 --> 03:48:57,060
Jump scare.

5203
03:49:02,780 --> 03:49:05,700
She's the old mint, but she's from the past.

5204
03:49:05,920 --> 03:49:09,380
So doesn't that make you the old mint?

5205
03:49:14,720 --> 03:49:15,320
Wait.

5206
03:49:15,440 --> 03:49:16,040
She's...

5207
03:49:16,040 --> 03:49:17,800
She's the old mint.

5208
03:49:18,340 --> 03:49:18,940
Oh.

5209
03:49:19,340 --> 03:49:19,940
Wait.

5210
03:49:26,890 --> 03:49:27,690
I'm confused.

5211
03:49:32,650 --> 03:49:35,490
I heard someone mention my obsession with ponytails.

5212
03:49:35,650 --> 03:49:36,590
Ponytail mint win.

5213
03:49:36,910 --> 03:49:37,830
I don't know.

5214
03:49:37,950 --> 03:49:42,090
I have to first even see if I'm staying.

5215
03:49:42,370 --> 03:49:44,410
And get a new outfit then.

5216
03:49:44,890 --> 03:49:46,870
If all of that...

5217
03:49:48,770 --> 03:49:50,030
One step at a time.

5218
03:49:51,710 --> 03:49:53,010
One step at a time.

5219
03:49:54,210 --> 03:49:55,090
One step at a time.

5220
03:49:55,430 --> 03:49:58,670
Though if I get a new outfit...

5221
03:49:58,670 --> 03:49:59,950
I already have an idea.

5222
03:50:03,050 --> 03:50:03,490
Yeah.

5223
03:50:03,730 --> 03:50:03,750
Thank you.

5224
03:50:04,050 --> 03:50:04,050
Thank you.

5225
03:50:04,350 --> 03:50:04,790
Thank you.

5226
03:50:10,950 --> 03:50:12,210
Anonymous, thanks for the donation.

5227
03:50:13,010 --> 03:50:14,070
Do you still have that?

5228
03:50:14,130 --> 03:50:17,330
So I was a French maid who fell in love with the prince and I got killed in the 14th century.

5229
03:50:19,830 --> 03:50:20,310
Yeah.

5230
03:50:20,430 --> 03:50:22,350
My very extravagant lore.

5231
03:50:23,590 --> 03:50:25,090
My very extravagant lore.

5232
03:50:27,450 --> 03:50:29,390
It's what turned me into a vengeful ghost.

5233
03:50:29,650 --> 03:50:30,070
You know?

5234
03:50:31,410 --> 03:50:31,890
But...

5235
03:50:32,470 --> 03:50:33,190
I don't know.

5236
03:50:33,210 --> 03:50:34,850
Maybe I was exaggerating a little bit.

5237
03:50:36,070 --> 03:50:38,390
I couldn't possibly get close with a prince.

5238
03:50:40,690 --> 03:50:41,410
I don't know.

5239
03:50:41,830 --> 03:50:43,190
Is that a light novel?

5240
03:50:44,150 --> 03:50:49,930
I was a French maid and I fell in love with a prince but I got... ended up dying in the 14th century.

5241
03:50:50,090 --> 03:50:51,370
And now I'm a ghost.

5242
03:50:53,190 --> 03:50:58,050
Destined to search the afterlife for all of eternity.

5243
03:51:00,830 --> 03:51:01,310
Vengeful?

5244
03:51:01,390 --> 03:51:01,730
Yeah.

5245
03:51:01,810 --> 03:51:02,770
I'm a vengeful ghost.

5246
03:51:04,930 --> 03:51:06,070
I've always have been.

5247
03:51:06,130 --> 03:51:07,190
I've always been a yurei.

5248
03:51:07,190 --> 03:51:08,790
You are a ghost.

5249
03:51:10,750 --> 03:51:12,850
I guess we could put the cat ears on.

5250
03:51:12,990 --> 03:51:14,210
If it's for you.

5251
03:51:16,270 --> 03:51:17,770
Put your cat ears on.

5252
03:51:18,130 --> 03:51:19,310
Meow for me kitten.

5253
03:51:20,390 --> 03:51:21,570
Meow for me kitten.

5254
03:51:30,870 --> 03:51:31,410
Meow.

5255
03:51:32,410 --> 03:51:32,950
Meow.

5256
03:51:33,670 --> 03:51:34,210
Meow.

5257
03:51:35,430 --> 03:51:35,970
Meow.

5258
03:51:37,130 --> 03:51:37,670
Meow.

5259
03:51:38,650 --> 03:51:39,190
Meow.

5260
03:51:41,030 --> 03:51:43,850
I may have missed it but what is your cat's name?

5261
03:51:53,630 --> 03:51:54,710
Boo-taro.

5262
03:52:02,150 --> 03:52:07,370
How do you feel about fan-made or fan-commissioned live 2D or 3D models?

5263
03:52:08,050 --> 03:52:09,230
If you want to!

5264
03:52:09,530 --> 03:52:10,350
Oh my gosh though.

5265
03:52:10,630 --> 03:52:13,390
That's like a lot though, isn't it?

5266
03:52:14,110 --> 03:52:14,670
Stinky.

5267
03:52:18,090 --> 03:52:19,110
Boo-taro.

5268
03:52:20,030 --> 03:52:22,690
That's the first thing that came up in my brain.

5269
03:52:27,790 --> 03:52:29,290
Kind of like buta-yaro.

5270
03:52:29,910 --> 03:52:31,910
Because he's so stinky.

5271
03:52:32,370 --> 03:52:33,790
He's also boo-taro.

5272
03:52:38,630 --> 03:52:39,790
Boo-taro.

5273
03:52:39,970 --> 03:52:40,290
That's right!

5274
03:52:42,830 --> 03:52:43,470
Boo.

5275
03:52:44,070 --> 03:52:45,190
Yeah, like boo.

5276
03:52:50,850 --> 03:52:51,370
Yeah.

5277
03:52:53,330 --> 03:52:54,630
Sir stinks a lot.

5278
03:52:55,590 --> 03:52:56,370
Boruto's dad.

5279
03:53:00,910 --> 03:53:03,310
Don't worry, the game I want isn't on sale yet.

5280
03:53:03,350 --> 03:53:04,270
So I can spare this.

5281
03:53:04,370 --> 03:53:04,690
Stop!

5282
03:53:06,410 --> 03:53:09,230
Welcome back to the mint phantom from the maidmaid channel.

5283
03:53:09,310 --> 03:53:10,230
Thanks Gonzalia!

5284
03:53:11,590 --> 03:53:12,950
It's been a while.

5285
03:53:13,450 --> 03:53:13,970
Hello.

5286
03:53:13,970 --> 03:53:14,170
Hello.

5287
03:53:25,920 --> 03:53:29,120
Play the Ghostbusters game PS3.

5288
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:30,280
Why?

5289
03:53:30,340 --> 03:53:30,880
Is it any good?

5290
03:53:31,560 --> 03:53:32,840
Is it something you suggest?

5291
03:53:33,280 --> 03:53:35,100
Oh my gosh, I can't wait for Zoombinis tomorrow.

5292
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:37,300
Zoombinis was maybe...

5293
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:40,480
So as a kid, I only played like...

5294
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:43,440
a handful of those edumatainment games.

5295
03:53:43,620 --> 03:53:43,880
Right?

5296
03:53:43,880 --> 03:53:45,860
And one was Zoombinis.

5297
03:53:45,880 --> 03:53:46,740
That was my favorite.

5298
03:53:46,920 --> 03:53:50,220
And the other one was Freddy Fish and the haunted schoolhouse.

5299
03:53:51,440 --> 03:53:53,220
Out of like those like...

5300
03:53:53,220 --> 03:53:55,220
Freddy Fish and the...

5301
03:53:55,220 --> 03:53:56,180
There's the car.

5302
03:53:56,660 --> 03:53:59,820
And then there's like that one kid that looks like Danny Phantom.

5303
03:54:00,340 --> 03:54:01,380
But out of like...

5304
03:54:01,380 --> 03:54:02,340
that whole...

5305
03:54:04,740 --> 03:54:05,420
edumatainment...

5306
03:54:06,180 --> 03:54:07,540
cinematic universe...

5307
03:54:07,540 --> 03:54:09,940
I only owned that one single...

5308
03:54:10,700 --> 03:54:12,040
Freddy Fish haunted...

5309
03:54:12,040 --> 03:54:14,100
haunted schoolhouse.

5310
03:54:15,420 --> 03:54:16,100
Pajama Sam!

5311
03:54:16,360 --> 03:54:17,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5312
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:18,020
Putt-Putt!

5313
03:54:18,140 --> 03:54:20,540
See, I don't know their names because I never owned the games.

5314
03:54:21,160 --> 03:54:22,160
I only...

5315
03:54:22,820 --> 03:54:24,280
I only knew...

5316
03:54:24,280 --> 03:54:26,080
Freddy Fish and only because...

5317
03:54:26,080 --> 03:54:28,340
I was interested because it was a game about...

5318
03:54:28,340 --> 03:54:30,060
a haunted schoolhouse.

5319
03:54:32,280 --> 03:54:33,300
I was like...

5320
03:54:34,010 --> 03:54:34,980
He's just like me!

5321
03:54:35,660 --> 03:54:36,860
I was like, oh my gosh.

5322
03:54:37,560 --> 03:54:39,820
I'm rooting for the ghost, baby.

5323
03:54:41,160 --> 03:54:41,920
But um...

5324
03:54:43,420 --> 03:54:44,300
Yeah, so...

5325
03:54:44,300 --> 03:54:46,000
I would play that...

5326
03:54:46,000 --> 03:54:47,520
all the time and I would play...

5327
03:54:47,900 --> 03:54:48,760
Zoombinis all the time.

5328
03:54:48,880 --> 03:54:49,940
Like, I've played...

5329
03:54:49,940 --> 03:54:51,980
I can probably quote more...

5330
03:54:51,980 --> 03:54:53,380
Zoombinis than I...

5331
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:55,540
think is healthy.

5332
03:54:57,020 --> 03:54:58,180
Welcome back boys!

5333
03:54:58,280 --> 03:54:58,980
Thank you for the Hakodate!

5334
03:54:59,080 --> 03:54:59,540
Thank you!

5335
03:55:01,960 --> 03:55:04,140
Could you get close to a prince if they were...

5336
03:55:04,140 --> 03:55:04,720
a cute girl?

5337
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:06,000
Or if they were a...

5338
03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:06,680
hot old man?

5339
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:08,660
Hi!

5340
03:55:10,140 --> 03:55:10,580
Where?

5341
03:55:10,840 --> 03:55:11,060
What?

5342
03:55:15,230 --> 03:55:16,230
I was saying...

5343
03:55:16,230 --> 03:55:18,010
Like, if I'm a maid, there's not a way...

5344
03:55:18,010 --> 03:55:18,990
I'm gonna get close to a prince.

5345
03:55:19,970 --> 03:55:21,730
They're so princely, you know?

5346
03:55:21,770 --> 03:55:22,170
Like...

5347
03:55:25,390 --> 03:55:26,910
Sounds like a webtoon though.

5348
03:55:27,410 --> 03:55:29,890
Sounds like a webtoon I might even read.

5349
03:55:32,910 --> 03:55:35,030
I used to have the Littlest Creature games.

5350
03:55:35,470 --> 03:55:36,670
And the Wishbone one.

5351
03:55:36,750 --> 03:55:37,650
I don't know those ones.

5352
03:55:38,070 --> 03:55:39,810
I don't know if you're familiar with either...

5353
03:55:39,810 --> 03:55:40,970
but Wishbone was my favorite thing.

5354
03:55:40,970 --> 03:55:42,250
Wishbone was the dog...

5355
03:55:42,250 --> 03:55:43,650
the detective dog, right?

5356
03:55:44,370 --> 03:55:45,850
I watched it a little bit.

5357
03:55:47,330 --> 03:55:47,870
FLEENS!

5358
03:55:47,870 --> 03:55:48,750
You're not...

5359
03:55:48,750 --> 03:55:49,450
FLEENS!

5360
03:55:50,810 --> 03:55:52,710
Well, whatever you are...

5361
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:54,610
MAKE ME A PIZZA!

5362
03:55:58,410 --> 03:56:00,970
Oh my gosh, I love the pizza guy.

5363
03:56:01,270 --> 03:56:02,350
I love when he goes...

5364
03:56:02,350 --> 03:56:04,070
MORE TOPPINGS!

5365
03:56:04,510 --> 03:56:05,950
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be...

5366
03:56:05,950 --> 03:56:07,770
I'm gonna be so obnoxious tomorrow.

5367
03:56:07,770 --> 03:56:09,490
I'm really sorry.

5368
03:56:10,490 --> 03:56:11,910
I'm gonna be so...

5369
03:56:11,910 --> 03:56:12,730
awful tomorrow.

5370
03:56:13,150 --> 03:56:13,710
I'm gonna be...

5371
03:56:16,770 --> 03:56:18,330
Oh my gosh.

5372
03:56:18,530 --> 03:56:19,610
Yes, Zoombinis!

5373
03:56:20,850 --> 03:56:22,010
So will we.

5374
03:56:22,130 --> 03:56:22,870
LET'S GO!

5375
03:56:24,690 --> 03:56:26,030
I'm so excited!

5376
03:56:26,170 --> 03:56:27,810
I've been wanting to play...

5377
03:56:27,810 --> 03:56:29,710
Zoombinis on stream for like...

5378
03:56:29,710 --> 03:56:30,230
3 years.

5379
03:56:30,450 --> 03:56:31,330
So I'm like...

5380
03:56:33,110 --> 03:56:36,030
It's my favorite Ejipitava game from a kid.

5381
03:56:36,270 --> 03:56:37,310
From when I was a kid.

5382
03:56:37,770 --> 03:56:38,550
I'm so excited.

5383
03:56:39,370 --> 03:56:40,670
When I was a Wiiwisp.

5384
03:56:43,250 --> 03:56:44,410
Oh my gosh.

5385
03:56:47,670 --> 03:56:48,670
Welcome back!

5386
03:56:48,670 --> 03:56:49,910
We missed you while you were in heaven.

5387
03:56:50,130 --> 03:56:50,990
Oh my gosh!

5388
03:56:51,550 --> 03:56:52,050
Beastotboy!

5389
03:56:52,630 --> 03:56:53,130
Hello!

5390
03:56:53,910 --> 03:56:54,730
Oh my gosh.

5391
03:56:54,770 --> 03:56:55,950
Thank you so much.

5392
03:56:58,050 --> 03:56:58,550
Yes!

5393
03:57:00,170 --> 03:57:01,410
Oh my gosh.

5394
03:57:01,550 --> 03:57:02,930
You can play anything now.

5395
03:57:03,010 --> 03:57:03,310
I know!

5396
03:57:04,490 --> 03:57:05,490
It's actually...

5397
03:57:05,490 --> 03:57:06,390
The freedom...

5398
03:57:07,950 --> 03:57:08,390
The...

5399
03:57:08,950 --> 03:57:11,650
It's kind of overwhelming where I'm just like...

5400
03:57:11,650 --> 03:57:12,770
When I was trying to...

5401
03:57:12,770 --> 03:57:15,350
When I was thinking of the schedule...

5402
03:57:15,350 --> 03:57:17,770
For next week, I was like...

5403
03:57:21,150 --> 03:57:21,910
Like I don't...

5404
03:57:21,910 --> 03:57:23,770
Maybe I shouldn't just start off...

5405
03:57:23,770 --> 03:57:25,490
With all the things that I wanted to play.

5406
03:57:26,070 --> 03:57:27,850
But in the end, I kind of...

5407
03:57:27,850 --> 03:57:28,590
Did that.

5408
03:57:32,230 --> 03:57:33,430
Now what changed?

5409
03:57:33,610 --> 03:57:35,050
In heaven, you know...

5410
03:57:35,050 --> 03:57:36,670
It's a little bit strict.

5411
03:57:36,890 --> 03:57:37,470
Because...

5412
03:57:38,810 --> 03:57:40,810
You know, you gotta follow those heavenly rules.

5413
03:57:41,330 --> 03:57:42,290
All those...

5414
03:57:43,030 --> 03:57:45,150
You know, you gotta be a good, pure soul.

5415
03:57:46,170 --> 03:57:46,770
So...

5416
03:57:46,770 --> 03:57:49,070
Zoombinis was not good and pure.

5417
03:57:49,210 --> 03:57:49,790
Apparently.

5418
03:57:56,830 --> 03:57:58,030
More toppings!

5419
03:57:59,110 --> 03:57:59,970
Big question.

5420
03:58:00,050 --> 03:58:00,670
Do you prefer...

5421
03:58:00,670 --> 03:58:01,750
Hot dog or pizza?

5422
03:58:02,990 --> 03:58:04,030
Probably pizza.

5423
03:58:05,050 --> 03:58:06,790
Yeah, probably pizza.

5424
03:58:12,690 --> 03:58:15,050
Oh my gosh.

5425
03:58:17,630 --> 03:58:18,590
Zoombinis.

5426
03:58:22,990 --> 03:58:28,950
And then the narrator, he's just like...

5427
03:58:28,950 --> 03:58:30,630
The Zoombinis...

5428
03:58:30,630 --> 03:58:31,710
Are off.

5429
03:58:31,710 --> 03:58:33,730
The Zoombinis...

5430
03:58:33,730 --> 03:58:35,490
Are going to the...

5431
03:58:35,490 --> 03:58:36,710
Promised land.

5432
03:58:37,190 --> 03:58:38,730
The Zoombinis...

5433
03:58:38,730 --> 03:58:41,330
Why are they going there?

5434
03:58:41,430 --> 03:58:41,990
I don't even know.

5435
03:58:45,390 --> 03:58:47,650
Fatal Frame Ace Attorney Waiting Room.

5436
03:58:48,530 --> 03:58:51,510
Maybe we will play Ace Attorney again.

5437
03:58:52,330 --> 03:58:53,830
We can do...

5438
03:58:54,650 --> 03:58:56,270
Some of the newer ones.

5439
03:58:59,710 --> 03:59:00,270
Oh...

5440
03:59:00,870 --> 03:59:01,430
Jeez.

5441
03:59:01,510 --> 03:59:02,430
Stop spoiling the game.

5442
03:59:02,510 --> 03:59:02,650
Okay.

5443
03:59:02,690 --> 03:59:03,150
I'm so sorry.

5444
03:59:03,270 --> 03:59:04,590
Oh my gosh.

5445
03:59:05,610 --> 03:59:07,510
I can't wait to play Zoombinis.

5446
03:59:08,970 --> 03:59:11,330
Isn't it weird that I'm this excited about it?

5447
03:59:11,410 --> 03:59:12,970
Isn't it strange that I'm just like...

5448
03:59:12,970 --> 03:59:13,690
Let's go!

5449
03:59:13,970 --> 03:59:14,850
Children's game!

5450
03:59:16,050 --> 03:59:17,490
But I just loved it.

5451
03:59:19,250 --> 03:59:19,810
Oh...

5452
03:59:19,810 --> 03:59:23,130
Actually, my favorite quote from the pizza guy...

5453
03:59:23,130 --> 03:59:25,430
And I quote this almost daily.

5454
03:59:25,490 --> 03:59:26,050
Is...

5455
03:59:26,050 --> 03:59:28,210
There's something on that I don't like!

5456
03:59:34,610 --> 03:59:35,170
Yeah!

5457
03:59:37,370 --> 03:59:39,430
Oh my gosh, it's so funny.

5458
03:59:44,310 --> 03:59:45,430
Thank you!

5459
03:59:46,550 --> 03:59:49,010
Can't wait to see... play older Ace Combat.

5460
03:59:49,690 --> 03:59:49,970
Yeah!

5461
03:59:50,130 --> 03:59:51,510
I can't wait to play that too!

5462
03:59:54,270 --> 03:59:56,470
So much... so much we can do!

5463
03:59:56,710 --> 03:59:57,730
Oh my gosh!

5464
03:59:57,730 --> 04:00:03,870
And honestly, I'm really super duper excited about the podcast because...

5465
04:00:04,730 --> 04:00:09,530
Besides the Metal Gear episode, there is one episode that I think...

5466
04:00:11,270 --> 04:00:15,010
May surprise some people and would be like...

5467
04:00:15,990 --> 04:00:20,790
So I'm... that's something that we're... that we're cooking so I'm just kind of like...

5468
04:00:20,790 --> 04:00:25,730
Actually, I mean we're cooking several things but something in particular that I believe...

5469
04:00:26,490 --> 04:00:27,650
We can...

5470
04:00:28,170 --> 04:00:30,730
You know, really do so I'm just like...

5471
04:00:33,990 --> 04:00:34,510
So...

5472
04:00:35,970 --> 04:00:38,650
Super duper excited with the stuff with the podcast.

5473
04:00:39,090 --> 04:00:41,670
It's just kind of an exciting time like I'm...

5474
04:00:41,670 --> 04:00:45,430
You know, happy to be back and I'm happy to be...

5475
04:00:46,650 --> 04:00:49,550
Able to do so much with you guys so...

5476
04:00:52,730 --> 04:00:54,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5477
04:00:56,810 --> 04:00:57,210
Oh...

5478
04:00:59,270 --> 04:01:01,030
Yeah, that one, that episode.

5479
04:01:01,370 --> 04:01:03,990
I can't even say when it will be out because I have no idea.

5480
04:01:05,130 --> 04:01:06,810
We have a sort of plan.

5481
04:01:08,450 --> 04:01:09,850
This game sounds super familiar.

5482
04:01:10,410 --> 04:01:12,870
Did you know if this game was ever part of a real arcade?

5483
04:01:13,970 --> 04:01:15,170
I don't... I don't know.

5484
04:01:15,810 --> 04:01:19,230
Also speaking of real arcade, please play Granny in Paradise some day.

5485
04:01:19,270 --> 04:01:20,870
It's about an old lady rescuing her cat.

5486
04:01:20,930 --> 04:01:21,790
It's 10 out of 10.

5487
04:01:22,010 --> 04:01:23,070
I will look into that.

5488
04:01:23,110 --> 04:01:23,470
Thank you.

5489
04:01:23,470 --> 04:01:24,730
You are a simp.

5490
04:01:24,730 --> 04:01:26,090
You are a simp.

5491
04:01:26,270 --> 04:01:26,770
Thank you.

5492
04:01:26,790 --> 04:01:27,210
Welcome back.

5493
04:01:27,210 --> 04:01:27,570
Thank you.

5494
04:01:28,390 --> 04:01:30,970
Ghostbusters PS3 360 game is really good.

5495
04:01:31,530 --> 04:01:35,270
And has all four original Ghostbusters actors reunited for one last time.

5496
04:01:35,290 --> 04:01:35,690
No way.

5497
04:01:35,770 --> 04:01:36,030
Really?

5498
04:01:37,250 --> 04:01:41,690
So after Ghostbusters 2, it's basically Ghostbusters 3 before we actually got more Ghostbusters.

5499
04:01:41,810 --> 04:01:42,010
What?

5500
04:01:43,230 --> 04:01:44,950
Wait, that's actually so awesome.

5501
04:01:45,750 --> 04:01:46,730
It's really good?

5502
04:01:48,470 --> 04:01:49,690
Hymen, how is it going?

5503
04:01:50,410 --> 04:01:51,150
I'm good.

5504
04:01:51,490 --> 04:01:52,230
I'm good.

5505
04:01:52,270 --> 04:01:52,690
I'm good.

5506
04:01:54,270 --> 04:01:56,530
Thanks for stopping by.

5507
04:01:57,270 --> 04:01:58,710
Have you played Devil May Cry before?

5508
04:01:58,810 --> 04:01:59,410
I haven't.

5509
04:01:59,990 --> 04:02:00,950
We can play that too.

5510
04:02:04,310 --> 04:02:08,350
Minta, I don't mean to alarm you but I'm starting to worry that Snake isn't going to fight his way out of the jungle.

5511
04:02:09,670 --> 04:02:11,090
Part of me is like worried.

5512
04:02:11,190 --> 04:02:12,110
What if it like...

5513
04:02:12,110 --> 04:02:18,630
You know how like if you leave a screen on for so long like that image will burn into the screen?

5514
04:02:19,630 --> 04:02:21,170
I'm like concerned about that a little.

5515
04:02:21,170 --> 04:02:23,170
I really wanted to get to like the...

5516
04:02:26,710 --> 04:02:27,510
I really...

5517
04:02:27,510 --> 04:02:29,050
Oh, we got forked again.

5518
04:02:29,470 --> 04:02:31,070
I really wanted to get to the...

5519
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,910
Oh my god, we got...

5520
04:02:31,910 --> 04:02:32,630
What is this?

5521
04:02:34,170 --> 04:02:34,590
Again.

5522
04:02:35,650 --> 04:02:36,850
Wow, both in a row.

5523
04:02:42,300 --> 04:02:43,740
Did you see my hand?

5524
04:02:45,520 --> 04:02:46,240
No, you didn't.

5525
04:02:52,540 --> 04:02:53,520
You saw nothing.

5526
04:02:54,680 --> 04:02:55,700
You saw nothing.

5527
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:57,640
You saw nothing.

5528
04:03:08,260 --> 04:03:08,900
Anyway.

5529
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:12,420
Shut up Sokolove.

5530
04:03:12,600 --> 04:03:13,760
This isn't about you.

5531
04:03:18,100 --> 04:03:20,840
She manifest this because I think I...

5532
04:03:21,560 --> 04:03:22,880
I think I got...

5533
04:03:22,880 --> 04:03:26,440
I think I got some energy from Zoombinis.

5534
04:03:26,620 --> 04:03:29,940
So I was able to, you know, partially...

5535
04:03:30,920 --> 04:03:32,740
have a physical fight.

5536
04:03:39,900 --> 04:03:41,100
What is it called?

5537
04:03:41,420 --> 04:03:43,940
Oh my gosh, I don't even know my own ghost terminology.

5538
04:03:50,220 --> 04:03:51,020
Yeah, corporeal.

5539
04:03:51,640 --> 04:03:52,720
An apparition.

5540
04:03:52,800 --> 04:03:53,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5541
04:04:01,400 --> 04:04:04,980
How do I get back to demo mode?

5542
04:04:05,260 --> 04:04:07,040
Oh, I think I know why.

5543
04:04:07,280 --> 04:04:09,200
It's because I have all these credits.

5544
04:04:10,120 --> 04:04:14,260
I have to get rid of the credits first, but I'm like stuck at 50.

5545
04:04:15,120 --> 04:04:17,080
I see now.

5546
04:04:17,300 --> 04:04:18,560
I see now.

5547
04:04:27,880 --> 04:04:29,720
I moved all my stuff around.

5548
04:04:31,760 --> 04:04:34,500
I'll just do stuff while we're talking.

5549
04:04:35,020 --> 04:04:36,200
Don't mind the background.

5550
04:04:36,940 --> 04:04:38,040
Don't mind the background.

5551
04:04:39,280 --> 04:04:39,760
What the?

5552
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:41,320
Again?

5553
04:04:43,940 --> 04:04:44,640
Okay, hold on.

5554
04:04:45,220 --> 04:04:46,960
Maybe we can beat this one this time.

5555
04:04:50,180 --> 04:04:53,480
Maybe we can beat... Maybe I can beat this one this time.

5556
04:04:57,880 --> 04:04:58,380
Nice!

5557
04:05:05,320 --> 04:05:08,960
What are the

5558
04:05:20,030 --> 04:05:21,210
chances of getting that?

5559
04:05:24,370 --> 04:05:26,570
I think I'm stuck on credits forever.

5560
04:05:26,970 --> 04:05:29,710
I think the game just said, yeah, you know what?

5561
04:05:30,070 --> 04:05:31,790
You will get unlimited money.

5562
04:05:31,990 --> 04:05:32,950
You don't have to pay.

5563
04:05:33,010 --> 04:05:36,050
Can you imagine if this happened in the actual thing?

5564
04:05:39,510 --> 04:05:42,330
Like in the actual arcade, if you just could play forever?

5565
04:05:44,490 --> 04:05:45,350
She's so good.

5566
04:05:46,430 --> 04:05:48,110
Wait, did I?

5567
04:05:48,950 --> 04:05:49,950
Oh, come on.

5568
04:05:50,030 --> 04:05:51,390
What are the odds of getting that?

5569
04:05:51,450 --> 04:05:53,890
If it's 50-50, I'm gonna pull my hair out.

5570
04:05:54,070 --> 04:05:55,150
It can't be 50-50.

5571
04:05:55,650 --> 04:05:56,890
It has to be more, right?

5572
04:06:07,620 --> 04:06:08,400
Look at him go.

5573
04:06:08,540 --> 04:06:08,660
Oh.

5574
04:06:10,280 --> 04:06:10,660
Sorry.

5575
04:06:10,960 --> 04:06:11,540
I'm so sorry.

5576
04:06:22,320 --> 04:06:23,660
I'm so sorry.

5577
04:06:23,780 --> 04:06:24,240
I screamed.

5578
04:06:24,380 --> 04:06:25,000
I'm so sorry.

5579
04:06:25,780 --> 04:06:26,740
I'm so sorry.

5580
04:06:40,300 --> 04:06:41,980
Now we have hints.

5581
04:06:45,020 --> 04:06:47,520
Now we have hints on how to beat Ocelot.

5582
04:06:51,480 --> 04:06:52,600
Are you kidding me?

5583
04:06:52,680 --> 04:06:53,840
Now there's hints?

5584
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:56,660
Sorry, guys.

5585
04:06:56,800 --> 04:06:57,440
I'm so sorry.

5586
04:06:57,620 --> 04:06:58,380
I'm so sorry.

5587
04:06:58,500 --> 04:06:59,300
I'm so sorry.

5588
04:06:59,480 --> 04:07:00,080
I'm so sorry.

5589
04:07:00,500 --> 04:07:02,020
I didn't think I was going to win.

5590
04:07:02,120 --> 04:07:03,000
I'm so sorry.

5591
04:07:03,140 --> 04:07:04,480
I didn't mean to hurt your ears.

5592
04:07:06,300 --> 04:07:07,400
I'm so sorry.

5593
04:07:07,400 --> 04:07:07,420
I'm so sorry.

5594
04:07:08,720 --> 04:07:10,680
Wait, we're back at Ocelot, though.

5595
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:12,260
Oh my god, wait.

5596
04:07:24,050 --> 04:07:29,070
I can

5597
04:07:40,610 --> 04:07:43,170
only, like, understand a little bit.

5598
04:07:46,350 --> 04:07:49,270
I think they want me to continue.

5599
04:07:50,770 --> 04:07:51,250
Advantage.

5600
04:07:51,510 --> 04:07:52,670
Okay, yeah, the rush.

5601
04:07:53,790 --> 04:07:55,290
Chuuu, thank you!

5602
04:07:59,200 --> 04:08:00,040
Audio doko?

5603
04:08:00,240 --> 04:08:01,060
Oh, I turned it down.

5604
04:08:05,420 --> 04:08:06,120
There we go.

5605
04:08:06,180 --> 04:08:06,700
Is that better?

5606
04:08:09,520 --> 04:08:10,000
Great!

5607
04:08:11,820 --> 04:08:12,300
Safe?

5608
04:08:12,640 --> 04:08:14,160
What is happening?

5609
04:08:14,660 --> 04:08:15,920
What is going on?

5610
04:08:17,220 --> 04:08:18,240
What is going on?

5611
04:08:18,380 --> 04:08:19,720
I have a safety zone now?

5612
04:08:21,100 --> 04:08:22,000
Oh my god.

5613
04:08:23,060 --> 04:08:24,140
What is happening?

5614
04:08:25,180 --> 04:08:26,540
Oh, they're getting a safety zone.

5615
04:08:26,560 --> 04:08:26,740
Save data.

5616
04:08:26,960 --> 04:08:30,140
So that's what I'm doing while it's, like, retrieving the save data.

5617
04:08:30,280 --> 04:08:30,840
I was like, hello?

5618
04:08:31,000 --> 04:08:31,940
Am I going to go into the bite?

5619
04:08:37,690 --> 04:08:38,490
No way.

5620
04:08:42,590 --> 04:08:43,570
Oh my god.

5621
04:08:45,470 --> 04:08:48,610
Highway to the safety zone.

5622
04:08:51,410 --> 04:08:54,550
Highway to the safety zone.

5623
04:09:07,790 --> 04:09:08,710
Oh my god.

5624
04:09:08,730 --> 04:09:11,570
We're back where we were before.

5625
04:09:12,510 --> 04:09:14,050
This is absolutely insane.

5626
04:09:14,410 --> 04:09:17,110
I don't have my stuff set up, so I'm sorry that I keep freezing.

5627
04:09:17,950 --> 04:09:18,450
Hold on.

5628
04:09:18,590 --> 04:09:21,770
I'm going to, like, go down here so it doesn't look as weird, maybe.

5629
04:09:22,390 --> 04:09:23,310
He has less HP.

5630
04:09:23,510 --> 04:09:23,670
Yeah!

5631
04:09:25,530 --> 04:09:26,410
Oh my gosh.

5632
04:09:27,510 --> 04:09:28,490
Okay, guys.

5633
04:09:28,850 --> 04:09:34,310
This is... this is... this... this is how we like to stream.

5634
04:09:37,190 --> 04:09:39,430
And we have the safety zone!

5635
04:09:42,510 --> 04:09:43,150
Nice.

5636
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:45,130
Yes!

5637
04:09:51,190 --> 04:09:52,110
You know what?

5638
04:09:52,170 --> 04:09:52,550
I will.

5639
04:09:58,620 --> 04:09:59,260
Nice.

5640
04:09:59,260 --> 04:10:00,880
Oh, that did a good amount.

5641
04:10:01,540 --> 04:10:03,620
Wait, my safety zone is going down.

5642
04:10:04,380 --> 04:10:05,660
Why is it going down?

5643
04:10:06,600 --> 04:10:07,300
Uh-oh.

5644
04:10:10,480 --> 04:10:12,240
Do it, Palpatine boys.

5645
04:10:13,620 --> 04:10:14,140
Palpatine.

5646
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:16,480
Oh.

5647
04:10:17,420 --> 04:10:18,980
It's like he talks a lot.

5648
04:10:23,500 --> 04:10:25,240
He's just excited, Snake.

5649
04:10:25,400 --> 04:10:26,520
He's just really excited.

5650
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:28,480
Oh my gosh.

5651
04:10:28,500 --> 04:10:29,340
Thank you for the Hakodoro!

5652
04:10:31,120 --> 04:10:32,080
Damix, thank you!

5653
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:34,780
Glad we have cat ears now.

5654
04:10:34,880 --> 04:10:36,340
I think we needed that extra pair of ears.

5655
04:10:36,460 --> 04:10:37,600
I'm so sorry, guys.

5656
04:10:37,660 --> 04:10:39,200
I feel really bad, for real.

5657
04:10:40,140 --> 04:10:41,000
I feel so bad.

5658
04:10:44,940 --> 04:10:45,920
Oh, he's shooting!

5659
04:10:46,240 --> 04:10:48,320
But because we have the safety zone...

5660
04:10:50,740 --> 04:10:51,640
Oh my god.

5661
04:10:52,360 --> 04:10:52,920
Oh my god.

5662
04:10:57,180 --> 04:10:57,900
Oh my god.

5663
04:10:58,460 --> 04:10:59,480
I don't...

5664
04:11:00,660 --> 04:11:00,940
Oh.

5665
04:11:00,940 --> 04:11:02,180
I hope we get another rush.

5666
04:11:02,380 --> 04:11:02,640
Oh!

5667
04:11:02,840 --> 04:11:03,120
Yes!

5668
04:11:03,500 --> 04:11:04,080
Oh my god!

5669
04:11:04,120 --> 04:11:04,400
Yes!

5670
04:11:04,400 --> 04:11:04,940
Rush, rush, rush!

5671
04:11:05,720 --> 04:11:06,280
Oh my god.

5672
04:11:07,940 --> 04:11:08,620
Oh my god!

5673
04:11:08,720 --> 04:11:09,380
Wait, you guys.

5674
04:11:10,040 --> 04:11:11,240
This is... this is...

5675
04:11:11,640 --> 04:11:12,960
No way, no way, no way, no way.

5676
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:13,920
Oh, I'm getting my hopes up.

5677
04:11:13,980 --> 04:11:14,300
No, no, no.

5678
04:11:14,360 --> 04:11:15,160
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

5679
04:11:18,300 --> 04:11:18,900
Oh my god.

5680
04:11:19,000 --> 04:11:19,760
Oh my god!

5681
04:11:19,780 --> 04:11:20,240
Oh my god.

5682
04:11:20,960 --> 04:11:23,000
I'm not... I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna...

5683
04:11:23,400 --> 04:11:24,000
I'm not gonna...

5684
04:11:26,840 --> 04:11:27,240
Oh

5685
04:11:31,000 --> 04:11:31,300
my god.

5686
04:11:31,400 --> 04:11:31,760
Wait.

5687
04:11:33,100 --> 04:11:34,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5688
04:11:34,360 --> 04:11:35,120
Oh my god.

5689
04:11:35,240 --> 04:11:35,840
Oh my...

5690
04:11:41,220 --> 04:11:43,060
Did you see the amount of damage?

5691
04:11:43,400 --> 04:11:44,400
Oh, that just did.

5692
04:11:44,880 --> 04:11:46,320
Because we're at... we have the advantage.

5693
04:11:47,740 --> 04:11:49,120
Okay, we're back to even, though.

5694
04:11:49,580 --> 04:11:50,860
Oh my god, this is insane.

5695
04:11:51,720 --> 04:11:52,780
Oh my god!

5696
04:11:52,940 --> 04:11:53,720
No way!

5697
04:11:54,180 --> 04:11:54,880
Another rush!

5698
04:11:55,660 --> 04:11:56,560
Another rush!

5699
04:11:58,820 --> 04:11:59,220
No,

5700
04:12:09,810 --> 04:12:10,370
no, no, no, no.

5701
04:12:10,370 --> 04:12:11,430
No way this is happening.

5702
04:12:11,630 --> 04:12:12,390
Oh my god!

5703
04:12:22,970 --> 04:12:23,870
Ksao, ksao, ksao!

5704
04:12:29,080 --> 04:12:30,380
Oh my god, Stank!

5705
04:12:30,880 --> 04:12:32,100
Stank, you're killing me!

5706
04:12:32,200 --> 04:12:33,360
You are doing it!

5707
04:12:33,540 --> 04:12:34,260
Oh my god.

5708
04:12:36,100 --> 04:12:37,960
You guys, you guys, you guys!

5709
04:12:39,480 --> 04:12:41,840
Oh my god, oh my god.

5710
04:12:42,000 --> 04:12:42,640
No way!

5711
04:12:42,900 --> 04:12:44,020
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry.

5712
04:12:44,180 --> 04:12:45,220
This is so crazy.

5713
04:12:47,680 --> 04:12:49,060
Come on, Stank!

5714
04:13:13,290 --> 04:13:14,590
Oh, here they come.

5715
04:13:14,750 --> 04:13:15,190
The bees.

5716
04:13:17,190 --> 04:13:17,710
Oh!

5717
04:13:18,730 --> 04:13:19,910
He found us.

5718
04:13:21,710 --> 04:13:23,570
Oh my god, thank you for the donation!

5719
04:13:24,030 --> 04:13:25,110
Oh my god!

5720
04:13:26,150 --> 04:13:27,350
Oh my god.

5721
04:13:27,810 --> 04:13:28,210
Awesome!

5722
04:13:28,370 --> 04:13:29,950
Oh my god, Stank, thank you for the donation!

5723
04:13:31,190 --> 04:13:32,190
You're really back.

5724
04:13:32,270 --> 04:13:35,050
I'm out of the country right now, so I can't watch too often, but here's a donation.

5725
04:13:35,190 --> 04:13:35,710
Thank you!

5726
04:13:37,050 --> 04:13:42,750
It's not as much as I used to do, but it should cover the three years of membership if you would let that continue.

5727
04:13:43,170 --> 04:13:44,190
Okay, I'm sorry.

5728
04:13:44,370 --> 04:13:45,370
I will do it on my own.

5729
04:13:45,550 --> 04:13:46,370
Stank, thank you!

5730
04:13:47,710 --> 04:13:48,410
I'm back!

5731
04:13:50,370 --> 04:13:50,930
Hisashiburi!

5732
04:13:51,650 --> 04:13:52,210
Sorry.

5733
04:13:52,390 --> 04:13:53,190
Oh my gosh.

5734
04:13:55,450 --> 04:13:55,730
Yeah!

5735
04:14:00,310 --> 04:14:02,050
That's what the push... it says to push.

5736
04:14:02,170 --> 04:14:03,610
It said push, so I pushed it.

5737
04:14:03,930 --> 04:14:04,990
I paused it.

5738
04:14:08,290 --> 04:14:11,570
I can't believe we clutched that, you guys.

5739
04:14:12,270 --> 04:14:13,670
I cannot believe.

5740
04:14:14,330 --> 04:14:17,690
Wait, so now... are we gonna be in the forest?

5741
04:14:18,010 --> 04:14:18,510
Or...

5742
04:14:21,270 --> 04:14:21,790
Oh!

5743
04:14:21,790 --> 04:14:22,810
Oh my god!

5744
04:14:23,190 --> 04:14:24,630
Oh my god!

5745
04:14:24,750 --> 04:14:25,010
Oh

5746
04:14:28,300 --> 04:14:28,680
my god!

5747
04:14:29,560 --> 04:14:30,680
Oh my god!

5748
04:14:32,160 --> 04:14:33,860
We're in a new area!

5749
04:14:35,120 --> 04:14:36,860
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry!

5750
04:14:39,960 --> 04:14:41,060
We're talking to you!

5751
04:14:45,820 --> 04:14:47,820
We're talking to you!

5752
04:14:51,900 --> 04:14:53,160
And she's just... she's just talking!

5753
04:14:53,940 --> 04:14:55,100
Streamer Luke, for real.

5754
04:14:55,860 --> 04:14:57,240
Oh my god, this is a first.

5755
04:14:57,440 --> 04:14:58,900
This is an absolute first for me.

5756
04:14:59,740 --> 04:15:02,620
This is an ab... this is an absolute first for me!

5757
04:15:03,580 --> 04:15:04,400
Oh my god.

5758
04:15:05,040 --> 04:15:08,360
And it's still just as... I still have unlimited credits!

5759
04:15:11,060 --> 04:15:12,440
The music is so epic.

5760
04:15:14,200 --> 04:15:16,140
Why is it so cool?

5761
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:17,780
We're just walking through the forest.

5762
04:15:17,960 --> 04:15:19,960
But it's a different forest!

5763
04:15:21,780 --> 04:15:24,100
It's a different forest!

5764
04:15:28,920 --> 04:15:31,200
It's a different forest!

5765
04:15:32,860 --> 04:15:34,520
It's a different jungle!

5766
04:15:36,940 --> 04:15:38,560
I was here!

5767
04:15:39,060 --> 04:15:40,480
I was here!

5768
04:15:41,920 --> 04:15:43,040
Oh, the end!

5769
04:15:43,260 --> 04:15:44,080
Oh my god, wait!

5770
04:15:47,580 --> 04:15:49,400
Are we going to fight the end?

5771
04:15:50,140 --> 04:15:50,900
No way.

5772
04:15:54,640 --> 04:15:57,500
Wait, remember how I said... if you were here...

5773
04:15:57,500 --> 04:16:01,000
I said earlier at the beginning of the stream, I've never seen the end...

5774
04:16:01,000 --> 04:16:03,260
I've never seen his fight before in this.

5775
04:16:03,400 --> 04:16:06,320
So I'm like, yo, I wanted to see... oh!

5776
04:16:06,400 --> 04:16:07,400
What the... oh!

5777
04:16:08,600 --> 04:16:09,080
Nice!

5778
04:16:09,400 --> 04:16:10,240
Good job, Snake.

5779
04:16:11,060 --> 04:16:11,220
Oh!

5780
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:17,680
What is going on?

5781
04:16:17,800 --> 04:16:18,900
What is actually happening?

5782
04:16:19,100 --> 04:16:19,920
What is going on?

5783
04:16:20,140 --> 04:16:21,240
What is happening?

5784
04:16:21,380 --> 04:16:21,940
What is happening?

5785
04:16:23,360 --> 04:16:24,260
CQC time?

5786
04:16:25,000 --> 04:16:25,480
Yo!

5787
04:16:26,080 --> 04:16:27,680
Hold on, let me do this too.

5788
04:16:27,880 --> 04:16:28,680
I'm going to end the poll.

5789
04:16:33,960 --> 04:16:36,280
Do you think the first part was like the tutorial?

5790
04:16:38,500 --> 04:16:38,980
No.

5791
04:16:40,700 --> 04:16:41,180
Wait!

5792
04:16:42,640 --> 04:16:43,120
Oh?

5793
04:16:43,520 --> 04:16:44,000
Oh?

5794
04:16:45,120 --> 04:16:45,920
Oh, come on.

5795
04:16:46,920 --> 04:16:47,400
What?

5796
04:16:47,440 --> 04:16:47,720
What?

5797
04:16:47,840 --> 04:16:48,080
What?

5798
04:16:48,120 --> 04:16:48,360
Oh!

5799
04:16:48,980 --> 04:16:49,060
What?

5800
04:16:54,040 --> 04:16:54,560
Okay.

5801
04:16:56,160 --> 04:16:56,680
Okay.

5802
04:16:59,520 --> 04:17:01,900
I didn't get the boss fight, but, you know...

5803
04:17:01,900 --> 04:17:03,100
I got 30 Gs!

5804
04:17:04,380 --> 04:17:05,120
Let me fight!

5805
04:17:05,500 --> 04:17:08,100
Okay, we have to keep fighting these guys.

5806
04:17:08,180 --> 04:17:09,340
We have to keep CQC-ing.

5807
04:17:10,280 --> 04:17:12,780
And getting so many codec calls.

5808
04:17:14,780 --> 04:17:15,660
Thank you!

5809
04:17:16,680 --> 04:17:17,920
You're pretty good.

5810
04:17:22,760 --> 04:17:23,220
Let me.

5811
04:17:24,280 --> 04:17:27,280
Let me.

5812
04:17:27,400 --> 04:17:28,960
Let me fight!

5813
04:17:31,200 --> 04:17:32,160
Let me fight!

5814
04:17:32,160 --> 04:17:33,060
Let me fight!

5815
04:17:34,920 --> 04:17:35,980
Let me fight!

5816
04:17:36,120 --> 04:17:37,500
Let me...

5817
04:17:37,500 --> 04:17:39,680
Let me fight!

5818
04:17:40,220 --> 04:17:42,220
Hello, Sakeyn.

5819
04:17:44,140 --> 04:17:47,200
Even though I don't like you, I don't like Paramedic either anymore.

5820
04:17:47,360 --> 04:17:49,500
I don't like any of these guys anymore, but, you know.

5821
04:17:51,020 --> 04:17:52,400
Let me fight.

5822
04:17:52,600 --> 04:17:53,360
I want to

5823
04:17:56,930 --> 04:17:57,190
throw a gun.

5824
04:17:57,190 --> 04:17:58,510
We have an explosion sector.

5825
04:17:59,010 --> 04:18:00,390
Very friendly to ghosts.

5826
04:18:04,690 --> 04:18:05,210
Let.

5827
04:18:05,330 --> 04:18:05,470
Me.

5828
04:18:05,610 --> 04:18:05,990
Fight.

5829
04:18:08,790 --> 04:18:09,310
Let.

5830
04:18:09,470 --> 04:18:09,750
Me.

5831
04:18:10,230 --> 04:18:10,750
FIGHT.

5832
04:18:12,170 --> 04:18:14,170
We're so good at CQC, you guys.

5833
04:18:14,310 --> 04:18:15,370
We're like the best ever.

5834
04:18:17,930 --> 04:18:19,710
We've walked so much.

5835
04:18:22,310 --> 04:18:24,430
Lookit, we keep getting straight walking.

5836
04:18:24,430 --> 04:18:26,370
We're just walking, walking, walking.

5837
04:18:26,370 --> 04:18:27,350
We're a walking crew.

5838
04:18:29,770 --> 04:18:30,890
I'm bloodthirsty.

5839
04:18:32,210 --> 04:18:34,150
And I'm just flipping all these guys.

5840
04:18:34,530 --> 04:18:35,770
They never see it.

5841
04:18:35,770 --> 04:18:37,310
Never see it coming!

5842
04:18:47,900 --> 04:18:48,700
Come on.

5843
04:18:48,800 --> 04:18:49,440
Hold on, Perrin.

5844
04:18:49,820 --> 04:18:51,640
Oh, oh, I need a tip.

5845
04:18:52,080 --> 04:18:53,020
To battle.

5846
04:18:59,500 --> 04:19:00,620
Keep going.

5847
04:19:01,900 --> 04:19:03,380
She's gotta taste her blood.

5848
04:19:05,240 --> 04:19:05,640
Oh.

5849
04:19:05,920 --> 04:19:07,600
I did it out of order, but that's okay.

5850
04:19:09,200 --> 04:19:10,200
Is it double audio?

5851
04:19:10,380 --> 04:19:10,620
Yeah.

5852
04:19:11,200 --> 04:19:12,280
Sorry, I do that.

5853
04:19:12,340 --> 04:19:13,380
I have a, uh...

5854
04:19:17,690 --> 04:19:19,110
So sorry that it's a little distracting.

5855
04:19:19,430 --> 04:19:19,830
Oh!

5856
04:19:19,890 --> 04:19:20,270
Oh!

5857
04:19:20,390 --> 04:19:20,610
Oh!

5858
04:19:20,690 --> 04:19:21,010
Oh!

5859
04:19:21,110 --> 04:19:21,450
Hello!

5860
04:19:21,990 --> 04:19:22,710
Hello, sorrow!

5861
04:19:32,400 --> 04:19:32,800
CHANCE!

5862
04:19:35,620 --> 04:19:36,020
No.

5863
04:19:38,060 --> 04:19:38,780
No, no, no.

5864
04:19:38,860 --> 04:19:39,340
No, no.

5865
04:19:39,460 --> 04:19:40,980
No, don't put me back here, please.

5866
04:19:41,420 --> 04:19:42,280
No, God, please.

5867
04:19:42,780 --> 04:19:43,420
Please, God.

5868
04:19:43,440 --> 04:19:43,780
God, no.

5869
04:19:45,120 --> 04:19:45,900
Oh, okay.

5870
04:19:49,800 --> 04:19:50,240
Oh!

5871
04:19:54,200 --> 04:19:55,760
I don't know what this means.

5872
04:19:55,880 --> 04:20:00,260
So there's, like, things written here on these buttons on the walkie-talkie here.

5873
04:20:00,320 --> 04:20:02,720
It says Transsaber is the first one that's green.

5874
04:20:02,880 --> 04:20:05,680
The second one is Sensor Sonar, but it's red.

5875
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:08,600
And the third one is Emergency, but it's green.

5876
04:20:09,320 --> 04:20:09,760
Oh!

5877
04:20:12,000 --> 04:20:12,840
What's going on?

5878
04:20:13,820 --> 04:20:14,300
I can't see.

5879
04:20:14,380 --> 04:20:15,040
I can't see.

5880
04:20:15,100 --> 04:20:15,820
I don't know what it is.

5881
04:20:18,800 --> 04:20:19,160
Oh!

5882
04:20:19,240 --> 04:20:19,380
Oh!

5883
04:20:19,600 --> 04:20:20,840
Big, big boss time?

5884
04:20:32,840 --> 04:20:33,200
No!

5885
04:20:35,280 --> 04:20:36,680
Oh, wait, he's saying new things now.

5886
04:20:38,680 --> 04:20:39,740
Okay, I think we're still in.

5887
04:20:40,280 --> 04:20:41,360
I think we're still good.

5888
04:20:44,360 --> 04:20:47,800
God, how long do people just sit here and play this to be able to get to this...

5889
04:20:47,800 --> 04:20:49,200
to get this far?

5890
04:20:53,540 --> 04:20:54,340
Endless Sokolov.

5891
04:20:59,090 --> 04:21:01,470
We just gotta keep getting through the woods.

5892
04:21:02,890 --> 04:21:04,510
Back to flipping guys, yeah.

5893
04:21:04,970 --> 04:21:05,630
More tips.

5894
04:21:07,630 --> 04:21:08,590
Yeah, but, like...

5895
04:21:09,150 --> 04:21:09,850
It's like...

5896
04:21:09,850 --> 04:21:11,110
Yeah, I get that the...

5897
04:21:11,110 --> 04:21:11,750
So it's like...

5898
04:21:11,750 --> 04:21:13,790
I get it, but it's just like...

5899
04:21:13,790 --> 04:21:14,410
How do I...

5900
04:21:14,410 --> 04:21:16,630
It says the tips, like, the colors are...

5901
04:21:16,630 --> 04:21:20,770
Like, you'll get the better stuff based on the color, but I'm like, how do I get the colors?

5902
04:21:20,790 --> 04:21:20,930
I don't know.

5903
04:21:20,930 --> 04:21:21,970
How do I get the...

5904
04:21:21,970 --> 04:21:22,310
You know?

5905
04:21:22,550 --> 04:21:23,250
Like, they don't...

5906
04:21:23,250 --> 04:21:25,350
They act like it's not just pure luck.

5907
04:21:25,850 --> 04:21:27,710
And also, this thing is rigged as hell!

5908
04:21:28,030 --> 04:21:30,190
I keep getting the same thing over and over again!

5909
04:21:31,990 --> 04:21:32,390
Like...

5910
04:21:40,620 --> 04:21:41,420
Skill issue.

5911
04:21:41,940 --> 04:21:42,740
Yeah, basically.

5912
04:21:52,790 --> 04:21:56,270
Oh, now we have the sensor, but we don't have the trans...

5913
04:21:56,270 --> 04:21:56,990
Oh, wait, the trans...

5914
04:21:57,410 --> 04:21:59,230
The trans saver is blinking.

5915
04:21:59,630 --> 04:22:00,170
I dropped it.

5916
04:22:00,170 --> 04:22:00,290
That's interesting.

5917
04:22:00,410 --> 04:22:01,790
I don't know why it's blinking like that.

5918
04:22:01,870 --> 04:22:02,130
But now!

5919
04:22:02,370 --> 04:22:03,130
He just said that...

5920
04:22:03,310 --> 04:22:03,690
Oh!

5921
04:22:03,790 --> 04:22:04,790
Now we have the sensor, too.

5922
04:22:06,110 --> 04:22:06,750
Oh, cool.

5923
04:22:10,650 --> 04:22:11,390
Thank you!

5924
04:22:12,130 --> 04:22:18,510
I usually just lurk, but I can't stay long, so when I wish you an amazing day, thank you for being a fantastic person and for the amazing time watching your stream.

5925
04:22:18,570 --> 04:22:19,150
Thank you!

5926
04:22:19,610 --> 04:22:20,010
Your...

5927
04:22:20,010 --> 04:22:20,410
Your...

5928
04:22:20,410 --> 04:22:21,790
Your name is so crazy.

5929
04:22:21,790 --> 04:22:25,510

04:22:25,510 --> 04:22:26,110
Thank you!

5931
04:22:29,210 --> 04:22:29,770
Fox.

5932
04:22:30,230 --> 04:22:30,790
Fox!

5933
04:22:33,590 --> 04:22:38,170
Well, I wonder if the trans saver goes red when we're using the codec.

5934
04:22:38,870 --> 04:22:40,830
Uh-huh-huh-huh!

5935
04:22:40,930 --> 04:22:42,130
Uh, baby!

5936
04:22:43,330 --> 04:22:44,270
Okay, please.

5937
04:22:44,630 --> 04:22:45,590
All right, snake.

5938
04:22:48,950 --> 04:22:49,510
Okay,

5939
04:22:55,680 --> 04:22:56,100
keep going.

5940
04:22:56,460 --> 04:22:57,320
What the...?

5941
04:22:58,400 --> 04:22:58,960
What the...

5942
04:22:58,960 --> 04:22:59,020
Oh, look!

5943
04:23:02,480 --> 04:23:03,360
Gotta head to bed.

5944
04:23:03,440 --> 04:23:03,940
Good night!

5945
04:23:07,870 --> 04:23:08,530
Don't worry.

5946
04:23:08,990 --> 04:23:12,230
I just kinda wanna see if we can get to the bomb spam.

5947
04:23:13,730 --> 04:23:16,630
If I lose the next one, then we'll call it quits.

5948
04:23:16,890 --> 04:23:17,510
You know?

5949
04:23:17,790 --> 04:23:19,550
I just wanna try one more time.

5950
04:23:19,550 --> 04:23:21,370
What the hell is this?

5951
04:24:01,090 --> 04:24:02,530
It's the actual game!

5952
04:24:03,410 --> 04:24:05,030
It's the actual game cutscene!

5953
04:24:05,870 --> 04:24:06,910
Oh my god!

5954
04:24:07,170 --> 04:24:08,410
Oh my god!

5955
04:24:08,550 --> 04:24:09,350
Oh my god!

5956
04:24:09,370 --> 04:24:10,210
Oh my god!

5957
04:24:16,610 --> 04:24:17,190
Oh my god!

5958
04:24:17,250 --> 04:24:18,130
Oh my god!

5959
04:24:18,870 --> 04:24:19,390
Pause!

5960
04:24:23,670 --> 04:24:24,190
Win!

5961
04:24:33,640 --> 04:24:36,380
Can't believe you used your ghost skills to grab a hold of luck!

5962
04:24:37,540 --> 04:24:39,520
This is... oh my god, the music?

5963
04:24:42,680 --> 04:24:44,580
Did you know there's actually a song?

5964
04:24:44,600 --> 04:24:46,420
There's a soundtrack for the Pachislot.

5965
04:24:47,560 --> 04:24:48,500
So, uh...

5966
04:24:49,880 --> 04:24:54,680
If you like any of the versions of these songs, you can actually get this CD for it.

5967
04:24:54,800 --> 04:24:55,800
I don't own it yet.

5968
04:24:56,260 --> 04:24:58,160
But after this song... oh!

5969
04:24:58,600 --> 04:24:59,500
It's so good!

5970
04:24:59,740 --> 04:25:00,440
Maybe I'll get it.

5971
04:25:01,280 --> 04:25:04,460
Okay, so Big Boss Time is 8 out of 30.

5972
04:25:04,720 --> 04:25:05,060
Okay.

5973
04:25:05,580 --> 04:25:06,460
That's what it says.

5974
04:25:06,760 --> 04:25:07,200
Yay.

5975
04:25:09,540 --> 04:25:10,260
Oh my god.

5976
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:13,100
Remember the Alago!

5977
04:25:22,670 --> 04:25:24,130
This is so ISO.

5978
04:25:24,690 --> 04:25:28,530
I don't know what's going on, to be honest, but it's kind of fun to see the scenes.

5979
04:25:54,520 --> 04:25:55,000
Yo!

5980
04:26:01,130 --> 04:26:02,470
This is so ISO.

5981
04:26:02,690 --> 04:26:03,750
I'm so into this now.

5982
04:26:06,990 --> 04:26:07,830
Safety Zone!

5983
04:26:10,230 --> 04:26:11,190
Big payout.

5984
04:26:11,610 --> 04:26:12,670
Big money, baby!

5985
04:26:25,040 --> 04:26:26,000
Big payout.

5986
04:26:26,060 --> 04:26:26,060
Big money, baby!

5987
04:26:26,060 --> 04:26:27,780
What are you doing?

5988
04:26:28,160 --> 04:26:30,260
Don't be so... crazy!

5989
04:26:31,720 --> 04:26:41,140
It's interesting that... these scenes are from... I guess they just didn't... have... maybe... I don't know what's the timing.

5990
04:26:41,440 --> 04:26:45,060
They... didn't get to...

5991
04:26:48,630 --> 04:26:49,890
Fox Engine.

5992
04:26:50,230 --> 04:26:51,030
Interesting.

5993
04:26:52,410 --> 04:26:53,450
Okay, we only have three more.

5994
04:26:54,350 --> 04:26:54,750
Oh.

5995
04:27:00,280 --> 04:27:01,340
Thank you!

5996
04:27:01,760 --> 04:27:02,720
I have my...

5997
04:27:04,570 --> 04:27:06,730
My Hidari from Migi memorized now.

5998
04:27:06,830 --> 04:27:07,170
Thanks.

5999
04:27:07,330 --> 04:27:08,730
Thanks for the Nihongo Jozu.

6000
04:27:09,390 --> 04:27:10,510
Nihongo Jozu, listen!

6001
04:27:10,710 --> 04:27:10,970
Yeah!

6002
04:27:11,090 --> 04:27:12,050
Me, there you go!

6003
04:27:14,510 --> 04:27:16,210
And don't forget the Manaka.

6004
04:27:17,170 --> 04:27:18,170
Manaka, in the middle.

6005
04:27:19,570 --> 04:27:21,470
I didn't think anyone would get this far.

6006
04:27:21,590 --> 04:27:22,250
Me neither!

6007
04:27:22,450 --> 04:27:23,230
Oh my gosh, last?

6008
04:27:23,390 --> 04:27:24,030
Oh my...

6009
04:27:24,570 --> 04:27:27,250
Oh my gosh, look at them!

6010
04:27:28,450 --> 04:27:30,790
They look so good!

6011
04:27:31,770 --> 04:27:33,170
Oh my god!

6012
04:27:34,870 --> 04:27:35,870
Look at them!

6013
04:27:36,090 --> 04:27:37,550
They look so amazing!

6014
04:27:37,950 --> 04:27:40,570
Oh, I've never seen this visual before!

6015
04:27:41,790 --> 04:27:42,350
I've never seen this visual before!

6016
04:27:42,350 --> 04:27:43,370
Oh my gosh!

6017
04:27:44,030 --> 04:27:45,310
Oh my gosh.

6018
04:27:45,810 --> 04:27:47,010
Oh my gosh.

6019
04:27:47,590 --> 04:27:50,210
See the whole, like, codex set up on it?

6020
04:27:50,270 --> 04:27:51,270
Like, this is so cool!

6021
04:27:51,390 --> 04:27:52,190
Oh my gosh!

6022
04:27:52,250 --> 04:27:53,530
I've never seen this visual before.

6023
04:27:54,530 --> 04:27:58,410
Yo, they look so cute together.

6024
04:27:59,710 --> 04:28:00,270
Wow!

6025
04:28:02,950 --> 04:28:03,870
Oh my god!

6026
04:28:03,870 --> 04:28:08,570
You can't see, but the exclamation point on the side here is also lighting up rainbow.

6027
04:28:11,630 --> 04:28:12,710
Second movement!

6028
04:28:13,870 --> 04:28:14,850
Oh my god!

6029
04:28:15,210 --> 04:28:17,090
Wait, this is also...

6030
04:28:19,910 --> 04:28:21,090
Oh my, you guys!

6031
04:28:22,130 --> 04:28:23,050
No way!

6032
04:28:24,110 --> 04:28:24,870
No way!

6033
04:28:25,110 --> 04:28:27,210
But also, why is this also...

6034
04:28:29,430 --> 04:28:32,030
From the... this is also original cutscene!

6035
04:28:33,250 --> 04:28:37,270
I thought I was under the impression that the whole thing was Fox Engine.

6036
04:28:37,790 --> 04:28:38,730
Solid time?

6037
04:28:39,010 --> 04:28:41,010
Wait, what is this saying at the bottom here?

6038
04:28:41,890 --> 04:28:47,210
Oh my gosh, that's my favorite part about Metal Gear Solid when he says, It's solid time!

6039
04:28:56,680 --> 04:29:00,090
Do you guys know this song?

6040
04:29:04,460 --> 04:29:05,680
What is this song?

6041
04:29:13,760 --> 04:29:14,440
Oh, sorry.

6042
04:29:18,280 --> 04:29:21,560
But I was under the impression that everything was Fox Engine made, so...

6043
04:29:22,620 --> 04:29:23,420
Oh my gosh.

6044
04:29:26,980 --> 04:29:32,380
This is the most unexpected development imaginable at the end of this stream.

6045
04:29:38,160 --> 04:29:39,860
No, this doesn't sound like Donna Burke.

6046
04:29:45,080 --> 04:29:46,100
This is amazing!

6047
04:29:57,340 --> 04:29:58,760
Why is this so...

6048
04:30:01,160 --> 04:30:03,660
Okay, I'm definitely buying the soundtrack now.

6049
04:30:06,540 --> 04:30:07,960
I feel like crying!

6050
04:30:08,400 --> 04:30:09,460
It was so beautiful!

6051
04:30:09,600 --> 04:30:10,240
It's so beautiful!

6052
04:30:11,120 --> 04:30:12,020
Oh, we can do it again.

6053
04:30:14,260 --> 04:30:15,580
Because we still have...

6054
04:30:16,780 --> 04:30:18,460
We have 40 out of 60.

6055
04:30:23,340 --> 04:30:24,580
This song goes hard!

6056
04:30:24,680 --> 04:30:25,080
It does!

6057
04:30:26,880 --> 04:30:29,260
I did not expect this to happen at all.

6058
04:30:29,260 --> 04:30:31,020
I'm so shocked.

6059
04:30:31,400 --> 04:30:35,940
This is so... I'm so happy this happens for the first time on stream.

6060
04:30:36,180 --> 04:30:37,260
I can't believe.

6061
04:30:39,340 --> 04:30:40,360
Oh my god.

6062
04:30:41,400 --> 04:30:41,960
Sorry.

6063
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:47,380
I feel like there might be people who will watch this just wanting to know more about the patchy slot.

6064
04:30:49,560 --> 04:30:53,940
And will just hear my obnoxious, like, screeching.

6065
04:30:53,940 --> 04:30:55,400
My Banshee screeching.

6066
04:30:55,400 --> 04:30:57,880
And my annoying commentary.

6067
04:30:59,280 --> 04:30:59,960
Scissors!

6068
04:31:03,540 --> 04:31:06,620
Okay, I'm gonna be quiet so we can get more of the song.

6069
04:32:02,290 --> 04:32:03,650
I love this!

6070
04:32:04,230 --> 04:32:06,010
It's so good!

6071
04:32:06,750 --> 04:32:08,130
Sasuga Metal Gear.

6072
04:32:08,410 --> 04:32:10,970
No matter what kind of Metal Gear it is.

6073
04:32:11,450 --> 04:32:14,150
It has amazing music.

6074
04:32:14,350 --> 04:32:16,170
Even as a patchy slot.

6075
04:32:16,670 --> 04:32:17,350
That's...

6076
04:32:18,730 --> 04:32:20,390
I need this song!

6077
04:32:21,070 --> 04:32:22,250
Oh my gosh.

6078
04:32:28,930 --> 04:32:29,950
Oh my god.

6079
04:32:30,790 --> 04:32:33,010
It's just so worth everything.

6080
04:32:33,950 --> 04:32:35,270
I'm so thankful for the Dodo.

6081
04:32:35,470 --> 04:32:38,330
Don't worry, this is the exact experience of what I was hoping for tonight.

6082
04:32:40,770 --> 04:32:41,290
Man.

6083
04:32:41,590 --> 04:32:43,830
The most obscure original Metal Gear song.

6084
04:32:44,270 --> 04:32:44,790
If...

6085
04:32:44,790 --> 04:32:45,890
Correct me if I'm wrong.

6086
04:32:46,130 --> 04:32:46,490
Like...

6087
04:32:46,490 --> 04:32:48,450
I don't recognize this song.

6088
04:32:48,450 --> 04:32:49,210
So...

6089
04:32:49,210 --> 04:32:50,210
Oh, it's over.

6090
04:32:50,630 --> 04:32:51,790
But if it's...

6091
04:32:51,790 --> 04:32:55,510
But if it's a patchy slot exclusive, that's like insane.

6092
04:32:57,010 --> 04:32:59,730
Title is become the big boss second movement.

6093
04:32:59,870 --> 04:33:01,930
And seems to be a patchy slot original.

6094
04:33:02,190 --> 04:33:03,110
No way!

6095
04:33:04,370 --> 04:33:05,670
Oh my gosh.

6096
04:33:07,910 --> 04:33:09,010
Where are we now?

6097
04:33:09,230 --> 04:33:09,870
Sound Forest?

6098
04:33:10,310 --> 04:33:11,630
Sound Forest?

6099
04:33:14,410 --> 04:33:16,510
I don't want to stop now.

6100
04:33:16,690 --> 04:33:17,910
This is like a cutscene.

6101
04:33:20,250 --> 04:33:21,030
Oh my god.

6102
04:33:21,050 --> 04:33:21,970
I literally, like...

6103
04:33:21,970 --> 04:33:22,570
I put my like...

6104
04:33:22,570 --> 04:33:25,370
I gasped and like...

6105
04:33:25,370 --> 04:33:26,890
Put my hand over my mouth.

6106
04:33:27,010 --> 04:33:27,710
Oh my god.

6107
04:33:28,150 --> 04:33:32,210
Oh my god.

6108
04:33:32,350 --> 04:33:32,990
Oh my god.

6109
04:33:37,070 --> 04:33:37,870
Oh my god.

6110
04:33:37,870 --> 04:33:38,090
Oh my god.

6111
04:33:39,350 --> 04:33:41,350
Oh I just want to hear him say the...

6112
04:33:41,350 --> 04:33:41,950
The...

6113
04:33:41,950 --> 04:33:43,110
When he...

6114
04:33:43,110 --> 04:33:43,570
He says...

6115
04:33:43,570 --> 04:33:44,270
Like...

6116
04:33:44,930 --> 04:33:46,450
Oh, he's like...

6117
04:33:47,170 --> 04:33:47,690
Sunei.

6118
04:33:47,830 --> 04:33:48,730
But he say...

6119
04:33:48,730 --> 04:33:48,950
Ah...

6120
04:33:48,950 --> 04:33:50,770
Sorry, my brain is like...

6121
04:33:50,770 --> 04:33:50,990
Let me hear you.

6122
04:33:50,990 --> 04:34:07,450
I'm literally melting right now because the way he says the snort, like, ugh, I'm dying right now, I'm sorry, I'm like, actually, oh my god, I can't think, oh my god, the bird!

6123
04:34:25,770 --> 04:34:27,630
How does this fight work, though?

6124
04:34:28,290 --> 04:34:30,070
This is the same as Ocelots.

6125
04:34:31,830 --> 04:34:34,470
I'm sorry, I'm, like, actually losing my mind right now.

6126
04:34:35,730 --> 04:34:36,550
Oh my god!

6127
04:34:37,010 --> 04:34:37,390
Okay.

6128
04:34:37,810 --> 04:34:39,290
Thank you for the donuts, you guys!

6129
04:34:40,110 --> 04:34:43,290
Singer's name is apparently Sa... Sa... how do you say that, though?

6130
04:34:44,570 --> 04:34:50,170
I don't even know Apache Slot soundtracks were a thing till now, but, like, adding it to your collection, Min, thank you, Pinkerton, thank you!

6131
04:34:51,670 --> 04:34:54,850
Watching Min making MGS Apache Slot history with this stream.

6132
04:34:57,830 --> 04:34:58,850
Oh, here, here, here.

6133
04:35:00,770 --> 04:35:01,310
Hippie!

6134
04:35:01,310 --> 04:35:01,430
Hippie!

6135
04:35:01,430 --> 04:35:02,570
Oh my

6136
04:35:06,440 --> 04:35:13,700
god!

6137
04:35:13,840 --> 04:35:15,480
Oh, I get goosebumps every time!

6138
04:35:15,580 --> 04:35:16,640
Every time!

6139
04:35:16,860 --> 04:35:17,520
Oh my god!

6140
04:35:19,380 --> 04:35:19,920
Sorry.

6141
04:35:30,280 --> 04:35:31,660
I'm not reading all this.

6142
04:35:31,740 --> 04:35:33,240
Wait, I think I actually...

6143
04:35:33,240 --> 04:35:33,760
Okay, wait.

6144
04:35:35,540 --> 04:35:36,080
Oh, okay.

6145
04:35:36,240 --> 04:35:37,640
It's saying that I can, like, okay.

6146
04:35:39,240 --> 04:35:45,520
I can, like, pause by pressing push, and I can skip the movies.

6147
04:35:46,320 --> 04:35:47,220
We're fine, we're fine.

6148
04:35:47,360 --> 04:35:47,760
I don't need it.

6149
04:35:47,840 --> 04:35:48,440
Oh, one... okay.

6150
04:35:49,060 --> 04:35:51,460
This is just what to read.

6151
04:35:51,520 --> 04:35:53,700
It says, like, while you're waiting, read this, or whatever.

6152
04:35:53,820 --> 04:35:55,840
We have one more thing to do until we...

6153
04:35:55,840 --> 04:35:56,960
until we move on.

6154
04:35:57,020 --> 04:35:57,340
Okay.

6155
04:35:57,760 --> 04:35:59,220
We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

6156
04:35:59,300 --> 04:35:59,580
Okay.

6157
04:35:59,720 --> 04:36:00,360
Oh my god!

6158
04:36:00,900 --> 04:36:01,620
Oh my god!

6159
04:36:01,900 --> 04:36:02,340
Oh my god!

6160
04:36:02,340 --> 04:36:02,860
Oh my god!

6161
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:07,040
Oh, he's so leafy!

6162
04:36:09,760 --> 04:36:12,020
How do I still have 50 credits?

6163
04:36:16,620 --> 04:36:18,760
We're finally at the end fight.

6164
04:36:19,180 --> 04:36:20,580
Oh my gosh!

6165
04:36:23,020 --> 04:36:24,120
It's the end, guys!

6166
04:36:24,220 --> 04:36:25,060
Time to leave!

6167
04:36:29,860 --> 04:36:33,900
Also, I noticed that there are two more...

6168
04:36:33,900 --> 04:36:35,780
Have you guys seen that there's two more slots?

6169
04:36:37,020 --> 04:36:41,060
I wonder if you can fight the boss, and if she's all five.

6170
04:36:42,620 --> 04:36:43,600
I wonder.

6171
04:36:44,200 --> 04:36:45,580
I wonder, I wonder.

6172
04:36:46,700 --> 04:36:47,980
Just skip the pain.

6173
04:36:48,220 --> 04:36:51,800
Yeah, that's the funny thing, though, is I've fought the pain before.

6174
04:36:52,440 --> 04:36:56,120
But, like, in a... like, it just skips around sometimes.

6175
04:36:56,240 --> 04:36:56,980
But the end?

6176
04:36:58,220 --> 04:36:59,460
And the fury?

6177
04:36:59,680 --> 04:37:00,780
I've never done.

6178
04:37:00,920 --> 04:37:02,220
So I'm thinking...

6179
04:37:05,620 --> 04:37:06,320
Oh my god!

6180
04:37:06,380 --> 04:37:07,060
Watch out, Snake!

6181
04:37:07,220 --> 04:37:08,300
You're just standing there!

6182
04:37:08,400 --> 04:37:09,420
You're just a sitting dog!

6183
04:37:09,540 --> 04:37:10,400
What are you doing there?

6184
04:37:10,500 --> 04:37:11,440
Standing man emoji!

6185
04:37:11,640 --> 04:37:12,400
You look so...

6186
04:37:14,040 --> 04:37:15,620
The bird looks so cute.

6187
04:37:15,900 --> 04:37:17,720
Oh my god, your aura's showing up!

6188
04:37:18,140 --> 04:37:20,260
Snake, don't just stand there like an idiot!

6189
04:37:21,040 --> 04:37:22,420
This guy's so dumb!

6190
04:37:24,220 --> 04:37:24,660
Ouch!

6191
04:37:24,760 --> 04:37:25,180
Ouch!

6192
04:37:25,300 --> 04:37:25,480
Ouch!

6193
04:37:25,520 --> 04:37:25,740
Ouch!

6194
04:37:25,820 --> 04:37:26,440
Sorry, I...

6195
04:37:26,440 --> 04:37:28,720
I was adjusting, and I, like...

6196
04:37:28,720 --> 04:37:30,340
You know when you, like...

6197
04:37:30,880 --> 04:37:31,100
Ouch!

6198
04:37:31,780 --> 04:37:32,660
Like you...

6199
04:37:32,660 --> 04:37:35,300
Um, catch your fingernail and, like, lift it up?

6200
04:37:35,620 --> 04:37:36,640
Bro is confused.

6201
04:37:37,300 --> 04:37:40,260
He's just... Bro is just as stunned as I am.

6202
04:37:40,360 --> 04:37:42,500
He's just like, how did I get here?

6203
04:37:42,900 --> 04:37:46,220
He was just like, literally an hour ago...

6204
04:37:46,220 --> 04:37:50,740
Or two hours ago, I was just... I was just, uh...

6205
04:37:51,280 --> 04:37:56,240
Listening to Sokolov, like, repeat the same phrase over and over...

6206
04:37:56,240 --> 04:37:59,260
I was walking through the same forest for two hours!

6207
04:37:59,340 --> 04:38:00,440
How did I get here?

6208
04:38:13,320 --> 04:38:15,540
I don't know how far I wanna go with this.

6209
04:38:15,600 --> 04:38:17,200
I don't know how far I wanna go with this.

6210
04:38:17,200 --> 04:38:18,840
Because I just noticed the time.

6211
04:38:19,060 --> 04:38:19,440
Because I just noticed the time.

6212
04:38:19,880 --> 04:38:23,540
And I've been streaming maybe a little longer than I intended to.

6213
04:38:23,740 --> 04:38:26,080
Which is fine, because I'm having so much fun.

6214
04:38:29,460 --> 04:38:31,300
Snake T posing the end.

6215
04:38:32,000 --> 04:38:33,560
The bottom screen is so cool.

6216
04:38:33,980 --> 04:38:35,340
Also, no more mini-Snake.

6217
04:38:35,360 --> 04:38:36,000
Yeah, you're right!

6218
04:38:36,300 --> 04:38:36,980
He's gone!

6219
04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:39,060
Also, for those who haven't seen...

6220
04:38:39,060 --> 04:38:40,360
It is one big screen.

6221
04:38:41,680 --> 04:38:43,100
So, it just kind of like...

6222
04:38:43,100 --> 04:38:45,140
In this part, it just kind of like fades.

6223
04:38:45,640 --> 04:38:47,040
You know, it's just like a fade effect.

6224
04:38:47,240 --> 04:38:48,000
But it's really cool.

6225
04:38:48,260 --> 04:38:50,080
And it's like, one big thing.

6226
04:38:54,800 --> 04:38:55,600
Uh-oh.

6227
04:38:56,480 --> 04:38:57,020
Uh-oh.

6228
04:38:58,080 --> 04:38:58,880
Uh-oh.

6229
04:38:58,880 --> 04:38:59,180
Wait!

6230
04:38:59,320 --> 04:38:59,980
Our safety zone!

6231
04:39:00,240 --> 04:39:01,000
Our safety zone!

6232
04:39:06,160 --> 04:39:07,160
Thank you for the...

6233
04:39:07,160 --> 04:39:07,600
Oh, sorry.

6234
04:39:07,740 --> 04:39:08,520
Thank you for the dodo.

6235
04:39:11,180 --> 04:39:12,720
Also, do you own the machine?

6236
04:39:12,860 --> 04:39:14,160
I do own this machine, yes.

6237
04:39:14,300 --> 04:39:15,980
This is my own personal machine.

6238
04:39:16,480 --> 04:39:18,660
So, I don't have to pay...

6239
04:39:21,860 --> 04:39:22,740
Oh, okay.

6240
04:39:23,760 --> 04:39:28,340
I feel like this fight will take way longer than Ocelot, so...

6241
04:39:29,720 --> 04:39:30,160
Maybe...

6242
04:39:30,160 --> 04:39:32,340
Maybe we'll die before I...

6243
04:39:34,320 --> 04:39:35,860
Before we get to do anything.

6244
04:39:36,420 --> 04:39:37,700
Yeah, so I don't have to...

6245
04:39:37,700 --> 04:39:39,400
I have like a little button down here.

6246
04:39:39,400 --> 04:39:41,460
That gives me unlimited...

6247
04:39:41,460 --> 04:39:45,840
Or not unlimited, but I can just press it and give me as many credits as I want.

6248
04:39:46,040 --> 04:39:49,660
So, I don't have to spend real money on this.

6249
04:39:49,800 --> 04:39:53,400
I already spent enough money to buy it, so...

6250
04:39:56,020 --> 04:39:56,500
Oh?

6251
04:40:12,570 --> 04:40:13,870
I'm getting really bad luck.

6252
04:40:16,310 --> 04:40:18,470
It's really cool hearing Snake talk so much though.

6253
04:40:26,050 --> 04:40:26,770
He's asleep!

6254
04:40:35,700 --> 04:40:36,500
He's asleep!

6255
04:40:38,140 --> 04:40:38,820
Come on.

6256
04:40:38,920 --> 04:40:39,100
Oh!

6257
04:40:40,100 --> 04:40:40,600
Yes!

6258
04:40:41,100 --> 04:40:41,600
Searching?

6259
04:40:41,600 --> 04:40:42,080
Searching?

6260
04:40:42,100 --> 04:40:42,720
Battle mode?

6261
04:40:43,020 --> 04:40:43,520
Searching?

6262
04:40:43,520 --> 04:40:44,240
Oh my god, it's so cool.

6263
04:40:46,000 --> 04:40:46,760
This is it.

6264
04:40:47,440 --> 04:40:47,940
This is it.

6265
04:40:47,940 --> 04:40:47,980
That's it.

6266
04:40:48,180 --> 04:40:48,320
That's it.

6267
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:53,020
Oh, no.

6268
04:40:53,560 --> 04:40:54,020
Oh, no.

6269
04:40:54,020 --> 04:40:54,060
Oh, no.

6270
04:40:54,200 --> 04:40:54,700
Oh, no.

6271
04:40:54,700 --> 04:40:55,000
No!

6272
04:40:55,000 --> 04:40:55,320
No!

6273
04:40:55,380 --> 04:40:55,560
No!

6274
04:40:55,580 --> 04:40:56,200
We had it!

6275
04:40:57,180 --> 04:40:57,880
This one's...

6276
04:40:57,880 --> 04:40:58,620
This one's tough.

6277
04:40:59,000 --> 04:41:00,520
But he's not shooting me either.

6278
04:41:00,700 --> 04:41:01,700
But I'm out of the save zone.

6279
04:41:05,900 --> 04:41:06,460
Uh-oh.

6280
04:41:06,540 --> 04:41:07,200
Uh-oh.

6281
04:41:07,820 --> 04:41:08,720
They gave me the donut!

6282
04:41:08,940 --> 04:41:13,420
Imagine dropping a save and coming back two weeks later to see the head defeated, but if Patchy's locked more...

6283
04:41:13,420 --> 04:41:14,960
I know, that'd be crazy, right?

6284
04:41:16,280 --> 04:41:16,940
Uh-oh.

6285
04:41:17,260 --> 04:41:17,940
Uh-oh.

6286
04:41:18,300 --> 04:41:20,380
Oh, Snake, why are you just standing there?

6287
04:41:20,500 --> 04:41:21,540
You big old dummy!

6288
04:41:23,160 --> 04:41:24,300
No, Snake, please!

6289
04:41:24,380 --> 04:41:24,680
Snake!

6290
04:41:24,680 --> 04:41:25,820
Uh-oh.

6291
04:41:27,300 --> 04:41:27,780
Oh!

6292
04:41:28,480 --> 04:41:29,300
Oh, god.

6293
04:41:32,580 --> 04:41:33,060
Ugh.

6294
04:41:34,180 --> 04:41:35,040
He's so...

6295
04:41:35,040 --> 04:41:36,700
He's so dumb sometimes!

6296
04:41:38,500 --> 04:41:39,940
I don't think...

6297
04:41:39,940 --> 04:41:42,800
Honestly, we might get a save on this, but...

6298
04:41:43,920 --> 04:41:46,500
I feel like we're just gonna end up dying.

6299
04:41:46,780 --> 04:41:54,200
If we die, though, I wonder if it will take us back to the very beginning or back to, like, this area, you know what I mean?

6300
04:41:54,260 --> 04:41:54,660
I don't know.

6301
04:41:54,660 --> 04:41:56,900
I wonder... I wonder...

6302
04:41:57,440 --> 04:41:58,540
He tanked that.

6303
04:41:58,680 --> 04:41:59,280
Oh, again?

6304
04:41:59,480 --> 04:42:00,140
So soon?

6305
04:42:02,760 --> 04:42:03,360
Snake!

6306
04:42:04,840 --> 04:42:06,080
Help me, yo!

6307
04:42:09,040 --> 04:42:10,860
Oh my gosh, Snake.

6308
04:42:11,140 --> 04:42:12,140
You're not... ooh.

6309
04:42:13,460 --> 04:42:15,900
He attacked so soon, we didn't even have a chance...

6310
04:42:15,900 --> 04:42:16,020
Oh!

6311
04:42:16,140 --> 04:42:17,220
Come on, search!

6312
04:42:17,600 --> 04:42:18,880
Search, Snake, search!

6313
04:42:19,400 --> 04:42:20,620
Use your eyes!

6314
04:42:21,760 --> 04:42:22,680
Thermal goggles!

6315
04:42:24,100 --> 04:42:25,260
Thermal goggles, Snake!

6316
04:42:28,660 --> 04:42:31,180
Why does he hit if you roll matches, though?

6317
04:42:31,240 --> 04:42:32,940
I don't think there's a way to...

6318
04:42:32,940 --> 04:42:35,320
Unless you get, like, a perfect... I have no idea.

6319
04:42:35,720 --> 04:42:38,640
I wonder if there's, like, a very, very specific...

6320
04:42:41,320 --> 04:42:43,680
...match that... like, match-up that you have to get, because...

6321
04:42:45,020 --> 04:42:46,540
But it's also rigged!

6322
04:42:46,800 --> 04:42:48,520
It's not letting me get...

6323
04:42:49,060 --> 04:42:50,660
...anything to avoid it.

6324
04:42:50,680 --> 04:42:51,640
Unless it's this one, let's see.

6325
04:42:55,240 --> 04:42:55,780
Never mind.

6326
04:42:56,140 --> 04:42:56,840
Never mind.

6327
04:42:56,840 --> 04:42:57,140
I

6328
04:43:08,390 --> 04:43:08,770
saw it.

6329
04:43:08,990 --> 04:43:10,590
Lock on, lock on, lock on!

6330
04:43:12,350 --> 04:43:13,190
Come on, Snake!

6331
04:43:17,610 --> 04:43:18,590
No, no, no, no, no!

6332
04:43:20,490 --> 04:43:20,850
Okay.

6333
04:43:21,990 --> 04:43:22,690
I can do it!

6334
04:43:22,890 --> 04:43:23,570
I can do it!

6335
04:43:23,630 --> 04:43:23,870
I can do it!

6336
04:43:25,990 --> 04:43:27,430
That does big damage!

6337
04:43:30,810 --> 04:43:31,570
More, more, more!

6338
04:43:31,670 --> 04:43:32,010
I can do it!

6339
04:43:32,090 --> 04:43:32,330
I can do it!

6340
04:43:33,930 --> 04:43:34,270
I can do it!

6341
04:43:34,490 --> 04:43:35,490
I can do it!

6342
04:43:36,030 --> 04:43:37,130
I can do it!

6343
04:43:38,390 --> 04:43:38,930
Oof.

6344
04:43:41,250 --> 04:43:41,790
Oof.

6345
04:43:42,650 --> 04:43:43,830
Big damage, though.

6346
04:43:45,710 --> 04:43:46,430
Uh-oh.

6347
04:43:46,490 --> 04:43:48,150
Oh, is this the end for us?

6348
04:43:48,310 --> 04:43:48,870
Get it?

6349
04:43:49,010 --> 04:43:49,690
Beat it.

6350
04:43:50,750 --> 04:43:51,610
Is this it?

6351
04:43:52,790 --> 04:43:53,330
Snake.

6352
04:43:53,510 --> 04:43:53,990
Snake.

6353
04:43:54,730 --> 04:43:55,270
Snake.

6354
04:43:57,030 --> 04:43:57,570
Oh!

6355
04:43:57,890 --> 04:43:58,170
Oh!

6356
04:43:58,370 --> 04:43:58,630
Oh!

6357
04:43:58,850 --> 04:43:59,390
Oh!

6358
04:43:59,890 --> 04:44:00,430
Oh!

6359
04:44:01,470 --> 04:44:02,010
Ssss...

6360
04:44:02,010 --> 04:44:02,650
Ah!

6361
04:44:02,650 --> 04:44:14,310
You slippery... you slippery snake, you!

6362
04:44:18,350 --> 04:44:19,270
Good, good.

6363
04:44:29,880 --> 04:44:33,320
Yes, yes, yes, see the footprints!

6364
04:44:36,120 --> 04:44:38,060
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

6365
04:44:38,080 --> 04:44:39,740
Okay, okay, search, search, search, search, search!

6366
04:44:40,880 --> 04:44:41,960
It's here, okay.

6367
04:44:45,040 --> 04:44:46,000
Oh, no.

6368
04:44:46,680 --> 04:44:48,060
We lost him.

6369
04:44:48,280 --> 04:44:48,900
It's okay.

6370
04:44:49,180 --> 04:44:50,640
Mint's poor ghostly heart.

6371
04:44:50,780 --> 04:44:55,860
I'm... my... I think my blood pressure right now is kind of insane.

6372
04:44:56,360 --> 04:45:02,600
Because I'm so... like... like... so happy and so...

6373
04:45:03,320 --> 04:45:06,960
Like, shocked and so... nervous?

6374
04:45:07,600 --> 04:45:07,920
Oh, no.

6375
04:45:08,500 --> 04:45:09,260
Snake.

6376
04:45:10,820 --> 04:45:11,580
Snake.

6377
04:45:17,200 --> 04:45:18,520
Oh, no!

6378
04:45:19,060 --> 04:45:19,820
Snake!

6379
04:45:24,260 --> 04:45:25,020
Snaaaake!

6380
04:45:32,090 --> 04:45:32,470
It's over.

6381
04:45:34,930 --> 04:45:38,210
Okay, here's where we figure out.

6382
04:45:38,210 --> 04:45:41,450
Here's where we learn if we start over from the very beginning.

6383
04:45:42,150 --> 04:45:44,730
Or... if the game is a little...

6384
04:45:45,950 --> 04:45:47,650
If the game is a little, uh...

6385
04:45:48,570 --> 04:45:49,350
What's the word?

6386
04:45:50,770 --> 04:45:52,650
A little kind to us.

6387
04:45:53,990 --> 04:45:57,870
Kojima actually intended this to be a three-week long gambling sequence.

6388
04:46:01,010 --> 04:46:01,570
Oh!

6389
04:46:03,290 --> 04:46:04,950
Jesus, that... and Vulcan!

6390
04:46:05,150 --> 04:46:07,710
I didn't even... for some reason, I didn't even...

6391
04:46:08,810 --> 04:46:10,130
consider fighting him either.

6392
04:46:12,910 --> 04:46:14,070
It did save!

6393
04:46:14,530 --> 04:46:15,770
It did save!

6394
04:46:17,670 --> 04:46:18,170
Yo...

6395
04:46:22,850 --> 04:46:24,450
I think we're back at the beginning.

6396
04:46:26,570 --> 04:46:27,070
Yep.

6397
04:46:27,890 --> 04:46:30,010
We gotta get boss time again, I think.

6398
04:46:31,330 --> 04:46:32,770
Okay, are we gonna get forked?

6399
04:46:32,770 --> 04:46:34,550
Let's get forked one last time, you guys.

6400
04:46:38,010 --> 04:46:38,970
Get forked!

6401
04:46:39,150 --> 04:46:43,590
Oh, wait,

6402
04:46:46,770 --> 04:46:47,310
no, no, no.

6403
04:46:47,330 --> 04:46:49,770
I just wanna go to, like, him walking around again.

6404
04:46:50,830 --> 04:46:51,710
Okay, there we go.

6405
04:46:53,010 --> 04:46:53,490
Alright.

6406
04:46:54,550 --> 04:46:55,470
Alrighty, guys.

6407
04:46:55,650 --> 04:46:56,550
Well, that was...

6408
04:46:56,550 --> 04:46:58,710
That was an intense run.

6409
04:46:58,930 --> 04:47:00,090
That was kind of insane.

6410
04:47:00,190 --> 04:47:01,090
That was...

6411
04:47:01,710 --> 04:47:02,670
That was...

6412
04:47:02,670 --> 04:47:03,450
A lot.

6413
04:47:03,570 --> 04:47:04,690
That was...

6414
04:47:05,290 --> 04:47:06,130
So much.

6415
04:47:06,890 --> 04:47:07,910
Holy cow!

6416
04:47:09,950 --> 04:47:10,930
Holy cow!

6417
04:47:14,030 --> 04:47:14,850
I did...

6418
04:47:14,850 --> 04:47:15,130
I...

6419
04:47:16,150 --> 04:47:20,670
I said that I really wanted to see the end battle, and I got to!

6420
04:47:21,350 --> 04:47:26,290
And I wanted to show you guys the theater mode, and I got to!

6421
04:47:26,650 --> 04:47:29,610
I got to show you guys Ocelot Battle!

6422
04:47:29,950 --> 04:47:35,070
And I got to show you how cruel it is, and then I got to show you how we beat it!

6423
04:47:35,070 --> 04:47:36,350
Oh my god.

6424
04:47:44,700 --> 04:47:46,960
That was so intense.

6425
04:47:47,360 --> 04:47:48,440
Secret song 2!

6426
04:47:48,600 --> 04:47:48,940
Yes!

6427
04:47:48,940 --> 04:47:49,680
The song!

6428
04:47:49,680 --> 04:47:52,000
The original Patchy Slot song!

6429
04:47:53,880 --> 04:47:56,060
I'm gonna go listen to it after this.

6430
04:47:56,280 --> 04:47:57,780
I'm gonna go listen to it after this.

6431
04:48:00,640 --> 04:48:02,500
Tomorrow is Zoombinis.

6432
04:48:03,020 --> 04:48:04,340
You're a soup!

6433
04:48:04,420 --> 04:48:05,700
You're a soup!

6434
04:48:05,900 --> 04:48:06,620
Thank you!

6435
04:48:06,820 --> 04:48:09,540
What insane luck for you to be able to beat Ocelot.

6436
04:48:09,540 --> 04:48:15,420
Enter a new area, discover a Patchy Slot exclusive OST, and face the end on your first Patchy Slot stream.

6437
04:48:15,680 --> 04:48:18,020
This has been so much fun and I'm happy to see you having tons of fun.

6438
04:48:18,100 --> 04:48:18,740
Thank you, man.

6439
04:48:18,780 --> 04:48:19,300
Thank you!

6440
04:48:20,460 --> 04:48:21,620
Thank you so much.

6441
04:48:25,100 --> 04:48:26,000
Oh, hold on.

6442
04:48:26,040 --> 04:48:26,760
Let me turn off the echo.

6443
04:48:26,840 --> 04:48:27,080
Sorry.

6444
04:48:27,660 --> 04:48:28,240
There we go.

6445
04:48:34,060 --> 04:48:35,960
I feel so fulfilled right now.

6446
04:48:37,880 --> 04:48:38,640
I can't...

6447
04:48:38,640 --> 04:48:39,760
How are you supposed to...

6448
04:48:39,760 --> 04:48:40,220
Like, okay.

6449
04:48:40,220 --> 04:48:40,960
Obviously...

6450
04:48:41,970 --> 04:48:43,760
Obviously, like, it's saved.

6451
04:48:44,840 --> 04:48:45,460
But...

6452
04:48:46,220 --> 04:48:48,120
How are you supposed to, like...

6453
04:48:50,780 --> 04:48:52,020
Continue and...

6454
04:48:53,720 --> 04:48:55,020
Actually beat it?

6455
04:48:56,100 --> 04:49:00,180
I'm so curious about every inner workings of this machine.

6456
04:49:00,540 --> 04:49:02,740
There's still so much that I don't know.

6457
04:49:03,220 --> 04:49:04,400
It's so fascinating.

6458
04:49:04,740 --> 04:49:05,520
So much fun.

6459
04:49:06,760 --> 04:49:08,540
What a purchase I made, eh?

6460
04:49:12,060 --> 04:49:13,140
What a purchase.

6461
04:49:13,540 --> 04:49:14,920
Konami amusement card?

6462
04:49:15,160 --> 04:49:16,720
No, there's nowhere to, like...

6463
04:49:17,260 --> 04:49:18,020
Tap it.

6464
04:49:19,480 --> 04:49:20,780
Not that I can see.

6465
04:49:21,240 --> 04:49:21,500
Chuu!

6466
04:49:22,080 --> 04:49:22,560
Chuu!

6467
04:49:23,100 --> 04:49:23,920
What is this?

6468
04:49:26,160 --> 04:49:27,840
Patchy Slot was actually so much fun to see.

6469
04:49:28,020 --> 04:49:28,700
Thank you for the stream.

6470
04:49:28,760 --> 04:49:29,200
Welcome back.

6471
04:49:29,240 --> 04:49:29,780
Thank you!

6472
04:49:30,120 --> 04:49:30,580
Thank you!

6473
04:49:30,980 --> 04:49:31,460
Chuu!

6474
04:49:31,460 --> 04:49:32,280
What's the stream meant?

6475
04:49:32,500 --> 04:49:33,080
Will you...

6476
04:49:33,080 --> 04:49:35,320
Will you be doing an MGS karaoke?

6477
04:49:35,660 --> 04:49:37,520
If so, don't forget to add a new song.

6478
04:49:37,600 --> 04:49:37,900
And I...

6479
04:49:37,900 --> 04:49:40,200
I would like to do an MGS karaoke.

6480
04:49:40,980 --> 04:49:44,240
There's not a ton of songs I can sing, but...

6481
04:49:45,720 --> 04:49:47,800
A while back, I made a mint Minecraft skin.

6482
04:49:47,960 --> 04:49:49,480
Totally not because I wanted to cope.

6483
04:49:50,740 --> 04:49:51,840
Wait, I have a question.

6484
04:49:56,630 --> 04:49:57,530
Is it this one?

6485
04:49:58,070 --> 04:49:59,050
Oh, that's so tiny.

6486
04:49:59,630 --> 04:50:00,530
Is it this one?

6487
04:50:03,090 --> 04:50:04,190
Like, a while back?

6488
04:50:04,270 --> 04:50:05,610
Like, how long while back?

6489
04:50:06,290 --> 04:50:08,390
This is from...

6490
04:50:11,410 --> 04:50:12,830
October 31st, 2020.

6491
04:50:13,150 --> 04:50:13,410
Wow!

6492
04:50:13,570 --> 04:50:13,950
Halloween!

6493
04:50:16,830 --> 04:50:17,550
Thank you!

6494
04:50:17,670 --> 04:50:17,910
Thank you!

6495
04:50:18,170 --> 04:50:18,910
It's another one?

6496
04:50:19,090 --> 04:50:19,330
Okay.

6497
04:50:20,050 --> 04:50:21,550
Just post it in the tag again.

6498
04:50:22,030 --> 04:50:23,070
So I can see it.

6499
04:50:25,830 --> 04:50:27,030
I want to play Minecraft.

6500
04:50:27,610 --> 04:50:29,750
But I'm trying to figure out how...

6501
04:50:30,630 --> 04:50:31,150
To...

6502
04:50:31,150 --> 04:50:31,870
To...

6503
04:50:33,950 --> 04:50:34,470
Because...

6504
04:50:35,190 --> 04:50:38,050
I want to maybe play in like a...

6505
04:50:38,050 --> 04:50:38,370
I don't know.

6506
04:50:38,390 --> 04:50:43,230
In a Minecraft server with maybe like other wisps.

6507
04:50:43,370 --> 04:50:43,750
But...

6508
04:50:44,750 --> 04:50:46,410
Well, probably memboos.

6509
04:50:46,530 --> 04:50:50,190
Like, probably you need to be a memboo to gain access to it.

6510
04:50:50,470 --> 04:50:54,010
But Minecraft doesn't let you...

6511
04:50:55,630 --> 04:50:56,890
It's part of their like...

6512
04:50:56,890 --> 04:51:00,330
Or rather, it's against their rules to play it like under a paywall.

6513
04:51:00,470 --> 04:51:03,230
So I wouldn't be able to play Minecraft in members.

6514
04:51:03,650 --> 04:51:05,290
So it's kind of like...

6515
04:51:06,550 --> 04:51:07,750
I don't know yet.

6516
04:51:09,950 --> 04:51:11,210
Play in single player.

6517
04:51:11,290 --> 04:51:12,510
I guess we could always do that too.

6518
04:51:13,250 --> 04:51:13,550
Yeah.

6519
04:51:14,370 --> 04:51:17,110
There is, of course, always that.

6520
04:51:18,850 --> 04:51:19,790
Yes, yes, yes.

6521
04:51:24,210 --> 04:51:25,530
Don't we own the server?

6522
04:51:25,730 --> 04:51:26,270
What server?

6523
04:51:26,590 --> 04:51:27,690
The non-exist...

6524
04:51:27,690 --> 04:51:28,490
There is no server.

6525
04:51:29,590 --> 04:51:32,210
It's completely non-existent.

6526
04:51:33,230 --> 04:51:34,050
I have...

6527
04:51:34,050 --> 04:51:34,970
I have to...

6528
04:51:34,970 --> 04:51:36,210
I have to buy Minecraft.

6529
04:51:38,610 --> 04:51:40,750
I have to buy Minecraft first of all.

6530
04:51:42,310 --> 04:51:42,750
So...

6531
04:51:43,690 --> 04:51:45,130
I got to do that first.

6532
04:51:45,310 --> 04:51:46,650
I don't have it yet.

6533
04:51:49,430 --> 04:51:50,030
Yeah, yeah.

6534
04:51:51,470 --> 04:51:52,910
You're a simp.

6535
04:51:53,430 --> 04:51:54,150
Vic Boss.

6536
04:51:54,250 --> 04:51:55,750
You're pretty good with this patchy slot.

6537
04:51:55,870 --> 04:51:56,470
Thank you.

6538
04:51:58,590 --> 04:51:59,250
Mint love.

6539
04:51:59,370 --> 04:51:59,930
Thank you.

6540
04:52:00,350 --> 04:52:05,110
I really never thought I'd have so much fun watching someone play patchy slot for five hours.

6541
04:52:05,490 --> 04:52:06,910
Thanks for the stream and welcome back, Mint.

6542
04:52:06,970 --> 04:52:07,850
Thank you so much.

6543
04:52:08,390 --> 04:52:09,810
Thank you, thank you.

6544
04:52:10,030 --> 04:52:11,610
Really, really appreciate it.

6545
04:52:11,910 --> 04:52:12,510
Yes.

6546
04:52:12,990 --> 04:52:13,830
Yes, yes.

6547
04:52:16,990 --> 04:52:19,010
A server without a nation.

6548
04:52:21,470 --> 04:52:23,530
Lots of people have Patreon servers.

6549
04:52:24,110 --> 04:52:24,710
Yeah.

6550
04:52:24,950 --> 04:52:26,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6551
04:52:26,550 --> 04:52:31,090
I don't know if Matara would be interested in doing a Patreon one.

6552
04:52:33,350 --> 04:52:33,950
Because...

6553
04:52:33,950 --> 04:52:35,350
First of all...

6554
04:52:35,350 --> 04:52:37,510
The Patreon will only be for...

6555
04:52:37,510 --> 04:52:45,310
The podcast length... so once the podcast is up, kind of dead server?

6556
04:52:45,550 --> 04:52:46,410
That wouldn't be so good.

6557
04:52:47,310 --> 04:52:58,610
And so if I am staying longer after the podcast, of course it would be good to have something that I control.

6558
04:53:00,390 --> 04:53:01,990
Skin posted on the tag.

6559
04:53:02,250 --> 04:53:03,570
Thanks for the skin tag!

6560
04:53:07,690 --> 04:53:11,550
Also, you played with the Ryusei Nova in a horror... That is true!

6561
04:53:12,190 --> 04:53:13,250
That is true!

6562
04:53:14,010 --> 04:53:15,450
I did play once.

6563
04:53:15,930 --> 04:53:17,390
Wait, then do I own it?

6564
04:53:20,350 --> 04:53:20,950
Wait!

6565
04:53:23,230 --> 04:53:24,790
Do I own Minecraft?

6566
04:53:26,390 --> 04:53:27,990
That's so true, I did...

6567
04:53:32,890 --> 04:53:34,210
I might have Minecraft.

6568
04:53:34,710 --> 04:53:35,870
I actually...

6569
04:53:35,870 --> 04:53:38,610
Okay, I vaguely remember...

6570
04:53:38,610 --> 04:53:40,010
Wait, uh oh.

6571
04:53:40,030 --> 04:53:40,910
I might be in trouble though.

6572
04:53:40,970 --> 04:53:42,510
I vaguely remember...

6573
04:53:42,510 --> 04:53:45,210
Okay, this is all coming back to me right now at this very moment.

6574
04:53:45,850 --> 04:53:47,630
I kept getting emails...

6575
04:53:48,550 --> 04:53:54,310
In my Mint email being like, Hey, don't forget to migrate your Minecraft over to Microsoft account.

6576
04:53:54,750 --> 04:53:56,230
And I was like, Ah!

6577
04:53:57,510 --> 04:53:59,070
I'll do that later.

6578
04:54:00,230 --> 04:54:00,710
I...

6579
04:54:01,450 --> 04:54:01,930
I...

6580
04:54:01,930 --> 04:54:03,530
I never did it.

6581
04:54:04,750 --> 04:54:05,230
So...

6582
04:54:06,270 --> 04:54:07,310
It's gone now?

6583
04:54:07,450 --> 04:54:08,850
Wait, but...

6584
04:54:08,850 --> 04:54:10,790
But I bought it, so...

6585
04:54:10,790 --> 04:54:12,850
If I just remake the account...

6586
04:54:13,610 --> 04:54:14,210
Wait...

6587
04:54:17,670 --> 04:54:20,250
Wait, so I have to buy Minecraft a third time?

6588
04:54:27,210 --> 04:54:28,350
No way!

6589
04:54:32,130 --> 04:54:33,330
No way!

6590
04:54:36,230 --> 04:54:36,830
Okay...

6591
04:54:38,350 --> 04:54:39,810
Okay, I'll buy it.

6592
04:54:44,090 --> 04:54:46,930
I swear so many people own Minecraft multiple times.

6593
04:54:48,450 --> 04:54:48,950
Why?

6594
04:54:49,310 --> 04:54:50,630
I bought it though!

6595
04:54:50,770 --> 04:54:52,110
I mean, I guess it is my fault.

6596
04:54:52,270 --> 04:54:53,070
They did warn me.

6597
04:54:53,190 --> 04:54:55,030
They did send me a lot of emails.

6598
04:54:58,770 --> 04:54:59,270
Minecraft...

6599
04:54:59,270 --> 04:54:59,490
No!

6600
04:54:59,610 --> 04:55:00,230
Tag is...

6601
04:55:00,230 --> 04:55:00,490
Oh no!

6602
04:55:01,510 --> 04:55:02,010
Stop!

6603
04:55:03,650 --> 04:55:05,150
No Minecraft funds.

6604
04:55:05,150 --> 04:55:06,790
Oh, don't worry.

6605
04:55:09,390 --> 04:55:09,870
Thank you!

6606
04:55:13,170 --> 04:55:13,650
Chu!

6607
04:55:13,650 --> 04:55:13,670
Chu!

6608
04:55:14,390 --> 04:55:14,530
Chu!

6609
04:55:14,530 --> 04:55:14,750
Chu!

6610
04:55:15,630 --> 04:55:16,510
Thank you.

6611
04:55:17,230 --> 04:55:19,630
Number servers are fairly common and it would be pretty cool.

6612
04:55:19,790 --> 04:55:20,290
I think.

6613
04:55:20,390 --> 04:55:20,630
Haha.

6614
04:55:20,790 --> 04:55:22,670
Not that I like Minecraft or anything.

6615
04:55:22,950 --> 04:55:25,450
You forgot to add an extra haha at the end of that.

6616
04:55:25,730 --> 04:55:27,230
Not that I like Minecraft or anything.

6617
04:55:27,390 --> 04:55:27,730
Haha.

6618
04:55:28,570 --> 04:55:29,050
Haha.

6619
04:55:29,430 --> 04:55:29,910
Haha.

6620
04:55:31,730 --> 04:55:32,210
Hmm...

6621
04:55:32,210 --> 04:55:33,910
I feel like by now...

6622
04:55:33,910 --> 04:55:36,670
Probably someone's going to be like, Someone took like mint phantom.

6623
04:55:36,810 --> 04:55:37,430
So what am I...

6624
04:55:37,430 --> 04:55:38,990
I have to come up with a new username.

6625
04:55:39,410 --> 04:55:39,710
Haha.

6626
04:55:40,470 --> 04:55:42,290
I have to come up with a new username.

6627
04:55:43,850 --> 04:55:44,410
Hmm...

6628
04:55:45,190 --> 04:55:46,190
We'll think of something.

6629
04:55:47,050 --> 04:55:48,130
Would love a member server.

6630
04:55:48,450 --> 04:55:49,770
Yeah, maybe we can do that.

6631
04:55:50,030 --> 04:55:50,870
Member server.

6632
04:55:51,490 --> 04:55:53,050
But I would play...

6633
04:55:53,750 --> 04:55:54,310
Um...

6634
04:55:54,310 --> 04:55:56,290
Not a members, obviously.

6635
04:55:56,630 --> 04:55:57,510
But normal.

6636
04:56:06,910 --> 04:56:07,470
Haha.

6637
04:56:08,090 --> 04:56:10,350
Mint phantom FPS VTuber real?

6638
04:56:10,910 --> 04:56:12,010
That sounds like a...

6639
04:56:12,010 --> 04:56:12,430
I don't know.

6640
04:56:12,430 --> 04:56:17,190
That sounds like a name that someone who shits themselves would take, you know?

6641
04:56:19,030 --> 04:56:19,510
Haha.

6642
04:56:25,160 --> 04:56:26,740
I don't want that kind of image.

6643
04:56:27,180 --> 04:56:27,660
Haha.

6644
04:56:29,020 --> 04:56:29,500
Haha.

6645
04:56:29,740 --> 04:56:30,220
True.

6646
04:56:30,800 --> 04:56:31,280
Haha.

6647
04:56:32,560 --> 04:56:33,040
Haha.

6648
04:56:34,600 --> 04:56:35,080
Anyway.

6649
04:56:35,180 --> 04:56:35,320
Haha.

6650
04:56:35,320 --> 04:56:35,700
Haha.

6651
04:56:37,420 --> 04:56:37,900
Anyway.

6652
04:56:38,860 --> 04:56:40,180
I had a lot of fun today.

6653
04:56:40,300 --> 04:56:41,260
I hope you guys did too.

6654
04:56:41,520 --> 04:56:42,560
Thank you so much.

6655
04:56:42,720 --> 04:56:44,540
I'm sorry that it took me so long.

6656
04:56:44,560 --> 04:56:47,760
Five hours to get to the really exciting bits.

6657
04:56:48,060 --> 04:56:49,220
But um...

6658
04:56:49,220 --> 04:56:49,440
Haha.

6659
04:56:50,480 --> 04:56:51,200
Um...

6660
04:56:51,200 --> 04:56:53,480
But I had so much fun.

6661
04:56:53,760 --> 04:56:54,960
And uh...

6662
04:56:55,540 --> 04:56:55,900
Haha.

6663
04:56:55,920 --> 04:56:57,600
I hear seething in the universe.

6664
04:56:57,740 --> 04:56:58,020
Do you?

6665
04:56:58,340 --> 04:56:59,740
I'm unbothered.

6666
04:56:59,880 --> 04:57:00,600
Haha.

6667
04:57:01,020 --> 04:57:01,740
Haha.

6668
04:57:02,000 --> 04:57:02,720
Haha.

6669
04:57:02,720 --> 04:57:03,380
Haha.

6670
04:57:03,380 --> 04:57:04,080
Haha.

6671
04:57:04,080 --> 04:57:04,740
Couldn't be me.

6672
04:57:05,240 --> 04:57:05,960
Haha.

6673
04:57:06,680 --> 04:57:07,400
Haha.

6674
04:57:08,120 --> 04:57:08,840
Haha.

6675
04:57:09,260 --> 04:57:09,640
Haha.

6676
04:57:09,660 --> 04:57:10,380
Haha.

6677
04:57:10,480 --> 04:57:10,640
Haha.

6678
04:57:10,720 --> 04:57:10,960
Haha.

6679
04:57:10,960 --> 04:57:11,500
Haha.

6680
04:57:11,840 --> 04:57:12,560
Haha.

6681
04:57:14,560 --> 04:57:14,900
Um...

6682
04:57:14,900 --> 04:57:16,500
Thank you guys for watching.

6683
04:57:16,720 --> 04:57:17,760
And uh...

6684
04:57:17,760 --> 04:57:19,760
See you tomorrow for Zoombinis!

6685
04:57:23,760 --> 04:57:24,240
Okay.

6686
04:57:25,400 --> 04:57:25,880
Otsumito!

6687
04:57:26,980 --> 04:57:27,460
Otsumito.

6688
04:57:27,480 --> 04:57:27,660
Oh.

6689
04:57:27,760 --> 04:57:28,520
You know what?

6690
04:57:28,540 --> 04:57:30,020
Actually I realized this um...

6691
04:57:30,020 --> 04:57:30,700
Yesterday.

6692
04:57:31,020 --> 04:57:31,780
Or not yesterday.

6693
04:57:31,940 --> 04:57:32,560
Well yes yesterday.

6694
04:57:32,680 --> 04:57:34,260
But like after um...

6695
04:57:34,260 --> 04:57:35,020
The karaoke stream.

6696
04:57:35,100 --> 04:57:36,280
I think because I went from karaoke.

6697
04:57:36,700 --> 04:57:38,820
Or from singing the last song to ending it.

6698
04:57:38,960 --> 04:57:41,140
Like you know I used to end my streams...

6699
04:57:41,780 --> 04:57:43,320
With playing Bustin.

6700
04:57:43,980 --> 04:57:44,460
So...

6701
04:57:44,460 --> 04:57:44,540
I don't know.

6702
04:57:44,540 --> 04:57:45,440
But...

6703
04:57:45,440 --> 04:57:47,280
I'm kind of also afraid of...

6704
04:57:47,280 --> 04:57:47,860
Uh...

6705
04:57:47,860 --> 04:57:48,610
The content...

6706
04:57:49,540 --> 04:57:50,200
Uh...

6707
04:57:50,200 --> 04:57:50,740
Whatever...

6708
04:57:50,740 --> 04:57:51,480
Police...

6709
04:57:51,480 --> 04:57:51,840
Con...

6710
04:57:51,840 --> 04:57:52,140
Uh...

6711
04:57:52,140 --> 04:57:52,800
You know...

6712
04:57:52,800 --> 04:57:53,020
Haha.

6713
04:57:53,140 --> 04:57:55,560
Especially because I still have a strike on my...

6714
04:57:55,560 --> 04:57:56,600
On my...

6715
04:57:56,600 --> 04:57:57,020
Uh...

6716
04:57:57,020 --> 04:57:57,440
Account.

6717
04:57:57,840 --> 04:57:58,500
But...

6718
04:57:58,500 --> 04:57:59,860
I think maybe...

6719
04:57:59,860 --> 04:58:01,800
Maybe I can do it?

6720
04:58:01,860 --> 04:58:02,260
I don't know.

6721
04:58:02,300 --> 04:58:03,720
I'm kind of afraid of uh...

6722
04:58:03,720 --> 04:58:05,240
Yeah the content ID.

6723
04:58:05,980 --> 04:58:06,640
Um...

6724
04:58:06,640 --> 04:58:08,120
Cause actually my uh...

6725
04:58:08,120 --> 04:58:10,900
My Bustin cover is even...

6726
04:58:12,100 --> 04:58:12,760
Um...

6727
04:58:12,760 --> 04:58:14,520
It doesn't have a strike.

6728
04:58:14,540 --> 04:58:17,300
But it is partially blocked according to it.

6729
04:58:17,420 --> 04:58:18,360
I don't even know where.

6730
04:58:19,540 --> 04:58:21,160
Where is it partially blocked?

6731
04:58:21,720 --> 04:58:22,480
Let's see.

6732
04:58:27,440 --> 04:58:29,440
Where are you blocked?

6733
04:58:43,600 --> 04:58:48,240
It has been partially blocked in some countries and or regions.

6734
04:58:48,540 --> 04:58:49,440
Yeah but where?

6735
04:58:50,120 --> 04:58:51,080
It doesn't tell me where.

6736
04:58:51,480 --> 04:58:52,100
Um...

6737
04:58:58,540 --> 04:59:00,220
How old of a block?

6738
04:59:00,400 --> 04:59:01,680
Long, long time ago.

6739
04:59:02,020 --> 04:59:11,780
And I never got... I never got like... even in the past when I... when I would play Bustin, I never got like content ID.

6740
04:59:11,900 --> 04:59:19,340
But I feel like maybe YouTube's stuff has changed a little bit in the past three years.

6741
04:59:19,340 --> 04:59:23,260
I think you're good as long as you don't watch another BWC video.

6742
04:59:25,440 --> 04:59:26,320
Oh my gosh.

6743
04:59:26,380 --> 04:59:32,680
We talked about that, Matara and I, in the latest Patreon... in the next Patreon episode, so...

6744
04:59:36,000 --> 04:59:40,260
We looked up some of those spy animals and how terrifying they are.

6745
04:59:41,200 --> 04:59:42,560
Just singing acapella?

6746
04:59:43,260 --> 04:59:43,760
Okay.

6747
04:59:48,300 --> 04:59:54,660
I wonder... I wonder... oh wait, do I still have my instrumental of it?

6748
04:59:56,100 --> 04:59:57,580
Maybe somewhere, right?

6749
05:00:00,400 --> 05:00:01,540
Maybe somewhere.

6750
05:00:04,140 --> 05:00:05,380
Oh, wait.

6751
05:00:07,940 --> 05:00:09,840
This is the mix.

6752
05:00:15,700 --> 05:00:16,200
Oh!

6753
05:00:16,340 --> 05:00:17,660
I do still have it!

6754
05:00:23,510 --> 05:00:24,590
I'll just sing it myself!

6755
05:00:29,250 --> 05:00:30,170
Can you hear it?

6756
05:00:31,250 --> 05:00:32,250
Oh, it's kind of quiet.

6757
05:00:34,430 --> 05:00:36,430
Why is it in one ear?

6758
05:00:38,990 --> 05:00:40,750
It's like so in one ear.

6759
05:00:48,310 --> 05:00:51,830
If there's something strange, sleeping in your bed.

6760
05:00:54,550 --> 05:00:55,730
Let me tell you something.

6761
05:00:56,670 --> 05:01:01,010
If there's something weird, sleeping in... why is it only in my right ear?

6762
05:01:01,190 --> 05:01:01,330
Ow!

6763
05:01:01,590 --> 05:01:02,590
Let me tell you something.

6764
05:01:03,470 --> 05:01:05,430
Busting makes me feel good.

6765
05:01:09,550 --> 05:01:10,070
Busting!

6766
05:01:10,270 --> 05:01:10,690

If you're all alone, let me sleep in your bed.

6802

Sleep?

6803
05:02:56,390 --> 05:02:57,950

05:03:01,790 --> 05:03:03,730
