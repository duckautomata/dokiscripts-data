1
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,920
Oh, oh, I think it's loud.

2
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm testing audio.

3
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Hello.

4
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,020
Hello.

5
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm testing audio.

6
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,340
This is okay.

7
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,340
I sound muffled.

8
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,800
How?

9
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,020
Hold on.

10
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,140
Let me take this thing off.

11
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,480
Let me take this thing off.

12
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,420
Let me take this thing off.

13
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,100
I'm holding my mic.

14
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,420
Like I'm at real karaoke.

15
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,610
Minto Stinko.

16
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,310
Motorboat is clear.

17
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,960
Where's brain rot?

18
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,620
Oh my gosh.

19
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,320
I leave.

20
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,320
I leave and...

21
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,760
The world turns to Uma Musume.

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,540
The world is obsessed with horse now.

23
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,540
It's kind of crazy.

24
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,770
Everybody... I was like, where have you guys been?

25
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,850
For the horse.

26
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,970
I've always been here, Minto.

27
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,970
At the horse derby.

28
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,370
If only... If only... I were a horse?

29
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,550
Would you bet on me?

30
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,850
Be honest.

31
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,990
Be honest.

32
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,050
Would you bet on me?

33
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,350
Would you go all in?

34
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,870
Did you hear the English version of Uma Pyoidensutsu?

35
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,710
I saw that it exists.

36
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,510
And that... Satohina sings in it too.

37
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,110
And...

38
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,510
But I bookmarked it.

39
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,750
I haven't listened to it yet.

40
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,650
No.

41
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm getting glued.

42
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,170
Don't... Don't turn me into glue.

43
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,630
So for those... Sorry.

44
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,490
I should back up a little bit.

45
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,310
First, thank you everybody for... The donuts.

46
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,690
Thank you.

47
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,610
Thank you.

48
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:21,950
Thank you.

49
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,470
Thank you.

50
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,590
And... Uh... Sorry.

51
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,590
It's been a minute.

52
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,570
Um... It's... Uh... I've been really busy.

53
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,230
But... Um... Uh... Today!

54
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:50,630
Well... Today, I have... If you are at the... Um... Anime Expo area... Um... Which... If you are, it's very early.

55
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,370
Go to sleep.

56
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,530
Um... Um... I will be performing at... Fantastic Reality.

57
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,330
And I'm nervous.

58
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,870
So I wanna do karaoke.

59
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,490
To kind of... Get these nerves out, you know?

60
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,330
Wait, hold on.

61
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,430
Let me fix something real quick.

62
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,350
Wah!

63
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,730
Hey, we're the 50 gifted!

64
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,730
And... Um... Uh... Think of it as like a... Warm up for my voice.

65
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,110
Run!

66
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,030
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

67
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:30,990
Oh my gosh, you guys!

68
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,850
Thank you!

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,850
Thank you!

70
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,130
Murr!

71
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,910
Happy birthday!

72
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,190
Happy, happy birthday!

73
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,030
I... Uh... I... Uh...

74
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,750
I... Uh...

75
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:56,630
Um... Um... Um...

76
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:27,830
Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um I'll do the thing I need to do.

77
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,510
I'll come back.

78
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,810
I'll sleep too.

79
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,270
Stop apologizing.

80
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,430
Call me Canadian.

81
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,030
It's not real, but you could call me that.

82
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,970
But, I will be back to normal stream stream.

83
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,670
Uh, yeah, very soon.

84
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:03,930
But, before then, there's a few more fun things that I must do.

85
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,710
So, we are on the lookout.

86
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,110
Yeah, ooh.

87
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,250
I got a healthy... what is this?

88
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,910
Some sort of tea.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Toasty.

90
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,080
They're working super hard.

91
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,080
Thank you.

92
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,360
I'm trying.

93
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,860
I know that everything right now is so...

94
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,800
No jelly?

95
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,400
What percent jelly are you?

96
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,260
I have jelly!

97
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,420
Hold on, let me go grab it.

98
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,220
Hold on.

99
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,690
Oh, I had it next to me the whole time.

100
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,070
I brought it over here.

101
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,010
I completely forgot.

102
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,970
My jelly.

103
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm probably like...

104
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,490
200% jelly.

105
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,310
For those who don't know, I love cognac jelly.

106
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,970
And, um...

107
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,730
I love cognac jelly!

108
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,150
And, I eat it a lot.

109
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,410
And, I become jelly.

110
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,490
Oh my gosh, though, you guys.

111
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,930
What flavor is it?

112
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,490
It's grape.

113
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,750
Budouå‘³.

114
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,730
I, um...

115
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,210
Another thing, too.

116
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,350
That I wanted to talk about.

117
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,270
Why it's hard for me to stream.

118
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,790
Is...

119
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,630
I am a ghost.

120
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,310
It doesn't...

121
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,310
Does not go outside.

122
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,510
And...

123
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,810
The heat...

124
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,650
Has completely...

125
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,450
I have...

126
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,130
You could call it...

127
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,330
You could call it an allergy to the sun, basically.

128
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,370
Hehehehe.

129
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,450
Hehehehe.

130
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,750
And...

131
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,090
And...

132
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,470
Um...

133
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,590
It completely...

134
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,450
Makes me...

135
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,530
It dries up all my ectoplasm.

136
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,370
And because...

137
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,170
I haven't been streaming...

138
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,630
I am basically...

139
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,070
A wisp like you guys.

140
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,810
I have no...

141
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,410
I have...

142
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,910
I have not been haunting...

143
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,770
And collecting...

144
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,050
Your life energy, so...

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,790
As much.

146
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,790
So I...

147
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,870
I...

148
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,590
I am...

149
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,570
I am so weak.

150
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,390
That's why you guys have to watch my streams.

151
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,310
Or else I...

152
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,210
I was like...

153
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,530
You know that thing...

154
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,790
Where if you don't believe in fairies...

155
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,890
They...

156
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,470
They die?

157
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,330
I learned that from Peter Pan.

158
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,130
For me...

159
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,670
If I don't stream and collect your life energy...

160
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,730
Then I...

161
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,730
I will...

162
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,450
I will...

163
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,450
I will become...

164
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,730
Just a little...

165
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,450
Will-o-wisp.

166
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,930
Now we know.

167
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,050
It's true.

168
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,950
How do you know so much about fairies?

169
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,190
Cause of Peter Pan.

170
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,270
So how can you thank you so much for the pink?

171
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,110
Thank you.

172
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,870
Like I said, I know that right now...

173
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,450
Things are very...

174
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,970
Mysterious.

175
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,130
And I...

176
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,790
Am busy, but I cannot talk about it.

177
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,370
And it's frustrating just as much for me...

178
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,590
As it is for...

179
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,530
Maybe you guys.

180
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,430
So...

181
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,770
I try to drop little hints.

182
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,330
Wink, wonk.

183
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,690
Here and there.

184
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,010
So...

185
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,870
And sometimes they're not even hints.

186
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,490
Sometimes it's just me being like...

187
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,010
Oh yeah baby.

188
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,750
This thing's coming and I'm working on it.

189
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,830
But uh...

190
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,830
Good kind of busy hopefully.

191
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,450
Mmhmm.

192
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,830
Mmhmm.

193
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
There's a couple things coming up that I...

194
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,530
Very...

195
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,290
Very soon.

196
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,210
That I think...

197
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,790
You guys will...

198
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,730
Like a lot.

199
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:54,830
What?

200
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,370
I think so.

201
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,110
That you guys will be...

202
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,910
Like...

203
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,190
Wah!

204
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,130
Very, very soon.

205
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,830
Very soon.

206
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,930
Mmhmm.

207
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,010
So...

208
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,530
That implies...

209
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,830
We stopped believing in you.

210
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,490
Don't stop.

211
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,710
Don't stop.

212
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,450
Believing.

213
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,250
How dare you be secretive about projects.

214
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,410
You have been asked to keep secret, you monster.

215
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,910
I am a monster.

216
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,150
Konbama.

217
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,930
Konbama.

218
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:29,970
Konbama.

219
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,470
Hmm.

220
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,430
So...

221
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,950
Yeah.

222
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,510
Spirit bombing you some energy.

223
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,350
Yeah.

224
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,310
Do the...

225
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,910
Lift your arms into the air.

226
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,310
Viking.

227
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,050
Dragon Ball.

228
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,150
Send me energy.

229
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,530
Or I'll just...

230
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,310
I'll just suck it right out of you.

231
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,450
Like I'm gonna do this...

232
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,110
Uh...

233
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,990
This jelly right here.

234
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,370
Nom, nom.

235
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm glad that's enough jelly for now.

236
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,100
Even though I want more.

237
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,580
Oh my gosh!

238
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,140
I forgot!

239
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I promised...

240
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,680
On Twitter if you saw it.

241
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,000
I said I would give some sloppy kisses.

242
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,480
Come here.

243
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,980
Wait.

244
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,340
Hold on.

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,300
I'll put away these bad boys.

246
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:53,940
Oh!

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,060
That's not the right number.

248
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,680
That's not the number.

249
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,300
Wait.

250
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,160
Is it the right number?

251
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,300
Yep.

252
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,860
Okay.

253
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
I think my thing's all messed up.

254
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,600
Whatever.

255
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Uh-uh-uh...

256
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay.

257
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,580
Chibi Mito coming in hot.

258
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,520
Newy!

259
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,080
Newy!

260
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,420
Newy!

261
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,020
Newy!

262
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,840
Minty Fresh.

263
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,380
It should be... a little jelly-like, actually.

264
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,580
Odd time to join the stream.

265
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,840
Welcome in.

266
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,520
Shall we sing?

267
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,240
I don't know what to sing.

268
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,760
I did this on such a... impromptu.

269
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,660
I did this so impromptu that I don't even...

270
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,880
I don't even have a reverb.

271
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,760
Um, by the way, it's just gonna be English songs, cause I...

272
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm lazy.

273
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,300
All I have is karaoke fun.

274
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Maybe karaoke is a bad idea.

275
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,120
Hold on, let me get a voicemint.

276
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Where?

277
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,720
Oh, they're over there.

278
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,400
One second.

279
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,400
One second, one second.

280
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,140
I will eat this.

281
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,400
And then...

282
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,380
I shall sing some songs.

283
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,200
Just a couple.

284
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,220
Like I said.

285
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,580
It's not like I missed you guys or anything.

286
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,720
That's why I give you big sloppy kisses and I...

287
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,900
Why isn't this coming out?

288
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,920
I...

289
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,560
I...

290
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,600
Stream at odd times.

291
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,380
...

292
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,960
Just to talk to you and see you.

293
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,180
Why isn't this coming out?

294
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,280
Hehehe.

295
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,620
Hm.

296
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,260
I eat my voicemap.

297
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,980
Dust Goal!

298
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,560
I miss you.

299
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,440
How's the volume, by the way?

300
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,900
Am I loud enough?

301
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,440
I can't hear myself.

302
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,540
I miss having monitoring.

303
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
I want to go home.

304
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,680
Quiet.

305
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,620
Let me try.

306
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,500
Also, I don't have a noise gate.

307
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,420
How's that?

309
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,000
Peeking?

310
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,800
Dark things.

311
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
What is that?

312
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,570
Better?

313
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,690
Good?

314
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,310
Yeah.

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,540
Old Town Road.

316
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:17,540
Like the... Like the... I'mma take you to the Old Town Road.

317
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,430
What?

318
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,830
Yes.

319
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,890
Little Nas X.

320
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,550
What?

321
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,470
Huh?

322
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,130
No.

323
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
Currently, I work with only 20% energy.

324
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:47,980
Oh no!

325
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,920
I literally give you all my energy.

326
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,220
Don't give me all your energy.

327
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,960
I need you alive.

328
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,260
So that...

329
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,420
I can keep stealing your life energy.

330
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll take it to like 1%.

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,120
And then you build it back up.

332
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,340
Well, be glad you have.

333
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,970
Are you doing song requests?

334
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,210
I don't know.

335
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,270
I don't know.

336
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,050
Okay, Doki.

337
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,170
Sure.

338
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,690
Hit me.

339
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,310
Hit me with your song request.

340
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,640
Go for it.

341
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm ready.

342
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,370
Oh, B12?

343
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,170
Shot B12.

344
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,370
Be kind to your pipes with song selection.

345
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,090
I know.

346
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,370
Thank you.

347
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,130
Nah.

348
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
Shot B12.

349
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,140
Shot B12.

350
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,820
I actually love American Dad.

351
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,560
So like... When I saw that, I was like...

352
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,260
Oh damn.

353
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,980
I wonder if they have it on here.

354
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,400
B12.

355
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,020
Oop.

356
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,090
Let me search American Dad.

357
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,930
Oh.

358
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,210
I'm getting like... American Pie.

359
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,650
American Boy.

360
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,170
American Girl.

361
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,950
American Idiot.

362
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,270
American Soldier.

363
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,790
American Honey.

364
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,230
American Kids.

365
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,090
American Pie Again.

366
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,670
American Woman.

367
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,530
American Teenager.

368
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,750
American Toothan.

369
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:12,150
Toon, American women... lots of American women... American music, American Honky Tonk Bar Association, American Pie again...

370
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,860
Oh gosh, you can like... you can like hear me slapping my knee.

371
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,620
I don't have pants on.

372
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm wearing my dress.

373
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,320
I'm just slapping my leg.

374
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,640
Doki asked for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

375
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,040
Did she?

376
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,440
Wait, I missed it.

377
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,520
Not even my song request.

378
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,580
Wait, hold on.

379
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm double checking if that's what you wanted, Doki.

380
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,500
Mickey Mouse.

381
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,460
Is it because of the music?

382
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,060
I picked it.

383
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Because it was kind of...

384
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,140
stupid sounding.

385
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,820
Oh, did I just shrink the screen?

386
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,860
Yes, I did.

387
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,500
Sorry.

388
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,960
Yeah, okay.

389
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,320
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

390
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,120
Actually, how does this go?

391
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,020
I guess we'll figure it out together.

392
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,880
Okay.

393
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,560
Let's do Mickey Mouse together.

394
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,620
Actually, I don't know how this goes.

395
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,250
They may be...

396
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,790
Wait, they might be Giants?

397
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,870
Miska.

398
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,030
Miska.

399
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,450
Mickey Mouse.

400
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,810
I think it's so loud.

401
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,890
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

402
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,770
That's me.

403
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,170
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

404
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,850
Mouse.

405
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,630
It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

406
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,490
It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

407
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,170
Come inside, it's fun inside.

408
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,050
It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

409
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,110
Roll call!

410
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,930
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

411
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,050
Oh, that's it.

412
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,180
Yay!

413
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,800
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

414
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,080
The ominous ending.

415
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,760
What do you mean I missed the best part?

416
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,820
Scammed?

417
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,380
What do you mean?

418
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,840
That's all they got on here.

419
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,020
Oh, wait.

420
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,420
There's...

421
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,560
Wait.

422
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
There's the Mickey Mouse Club.

423
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Let me see if this is better.

424
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:39,650
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

425
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,630
Weep, weep, weep.

426
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,550
Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me?

427
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,130
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

428
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,070
Hi there, hi there.

429
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,050
Oh, there's a wish you could be.

430
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,510
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-I-C.

431
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,490
Mickey Mouse.

432
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,310
Mickey Mouse.

433
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,870
What?

434
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,570
Come along and sing this song and join the Danmarine.

435
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,130
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-I-C.

436
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,370
Mickey Mouse Club.

437
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,190
Mickey Mouse Club.

438
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,630
We'll have fun.

439
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,670
We'll meet new faces.

440
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,450
We'll do things and we'll go places.

441
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,110
All around the world we're marching.

442
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,570
Donald Duck is who that was supposed to be.

443
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,970
Yeah, why is Donald Duck shot shot?

444
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,630
That's what I heard too.

445
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,490
Who's the leader of the club that's meant for you and me?

446
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,050
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

447
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,170
Hi there, hi, ho there.

448
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,850
You're as long as the best can be.

449
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,370
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

450
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,530
Mickey Mouse.

451
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,370
Donald Duck.

452
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,290
Mickey Mouse.

453
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,230
Donald Duck.

454
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,230
Forever a little solo and a ho, hi, hi, hi, hi.

455
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,510
Come along and sing this song and join the Danmarine.

456
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,150
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

457
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,780
Here's the continue to bun.

458
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,800
What is happening?

459
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,280
What's going on?

460
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,800
Yay!

461
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,020
For now it's time to say goodbye to all our company.

462
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,160
We're going to die!

463
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:15,420
M-I-C-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E-Y.

464
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,220
We like ya.

465
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,070
This is what they sing when they lower you into the coffin.

466
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,190
Wait, I have to play the Donald Duck part again.

467
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,390
It's so out of the field.

468
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,830
Here, I'm even gonna change it.

469
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,250
Absolute cinema.

470
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,170
Sorry, it's a little slow to load because of the Wi-Fi.

471
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,570
Minky Mouse.

472
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,170
Minky Mouse.

473
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,190
Cheers to my job.

474
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,290
Thanks for the karaoke.

475
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,110
Thanks, Doki!

476
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,210
See you later.

477
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,910
Hello, is it gonna load?

478
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,050
Oh!

479
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,570
Uh...

480
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,390
Are we back?

481
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,650
Welcome back?

482
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,750
Are we back?

483
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,770
We're live?

484
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,660
We're good?

485
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,680
Okay.

486
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,640
Hold on, let me try to...

487
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,060
Pressing this again.

488
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,120
The Wi-Fi here is like...

489
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,480
It just sometimes...

490
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,260
Like, poops itself.

491
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,160
It's kind of...

492
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,840
It's kind of like the worst Wi-Fi I've had in a hotel before.

493
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,060
Oh, here we go.

494
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,280
Okay.

495
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,840
It was about here.

496
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,900
M-U-C.

497
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,060
Oh, wait.

498
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,220
We need this.

499
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,710
M-U-C.

500
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,770
Minky Mouse!

501
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,570
Minky Mouse!

502
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,450
Minky Mouse!

503
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,840
You guys' comments are killing me.

504
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm already dead.

505
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,720
If I wasn't already dead, you guys would kill me again.

506
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,220
Maybe we don't do Disney.

507
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,140
Oh my goodness.

508
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,140
Sorry, the Wi-Fi is so bad.

509
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm glad it lasted for the collab the other day, no?

510
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,480
Oh, goodness gracious.

511
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,520
Minky Mouse and Ducky Duck.

512
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,260
One more time, one more time, for old times' sake.

513
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,320
Me when I lie on my resume.

514
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,660
This guy is just like, oh yeah, I can do a Donald Duck impression.

515
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh

516
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,180
gosh.

517
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,320
Oh, it's so...

518
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,780
This is so funny.

519
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,660
Oh goodness gracious.

520
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,720
That was what I needed.

521
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,240
Holy moly.

522
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,600
Wait, what was the other one?

523
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,080
It was over here, I think.

524
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Here, here.

525
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,520
Oh my god.

526
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,800
What is he saying?

527
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,580
He's supposed to be saying Donald Duck.

528
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
Okay, I'm sorry.

529
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm in literal tears right now.

530
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,920
Let's think something else.

531
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,420
Let's think something else.

532
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,020
Well, shall we?

533
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh, I can't watch that.

534
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,100
I can't listen to it again.

535
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,280
I will go to...

536
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,960
I will...

537
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,780
I will cease to exist.

538
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,120
We have a danger!

539
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,260
Happy birthday!

540
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,980
Thank you!

541
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,940
Thank you, thank you.

542
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,160
One last time, please, and I'll just watch the VOD.

543
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,060
Watch the VOD.

544
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:42,760
Okay.

545
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,720
Alright.

546
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,440
What shall we sing?

547
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,700
Now I'm like...

548
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,020
Do we goofy?

549
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,260
Hmm.

550
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,400
Oh.

551
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,840
Just realized the names are normal again.

552
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,440
You're right!

553
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,960
I wish they would fix the comments.

554
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,500
Like, when people comment on my videos, they also are like the ats.

555
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,560
And it's hard to...

556
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,380
If I don't recognize your profile picture...

557
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,980
Or if your at is...

558
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,700
Unless your at is the same as...

559
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,320
Your...

560
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,780
Your...

561
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Your username...

562
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,000
It's...

563
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,780
So annoying.

564
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,500
She doesn't recognize us.

565
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,100
Another YouTube moment.

566
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,140
It makes no sense.

567
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,580
Makes no sense.

568
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,840
Okay.

569
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,520
Let's see.

570
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,380
I'm gonna go to like...

571
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,960
Not my favorites.

572
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,420
Let's see.

573
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,100
Um...

574
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,990
Ah...

575
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,490
Well, let's see.

576
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,030
Um...

577
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,750
Let's enter jazz.

578
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,350
Oh.

579
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,430
Wait a second.

580
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,370
Oh, I accidentally clicked love songs instead.

581
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,150
But we could do this one.

582
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,990
We could do this one.

583
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,350
We could do this one.

584
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,390
You don't like jazz?

585
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,330
Never knew why they added ats.

586
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:09,970
Me neither.

587
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,890
I don't get it.

588
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:11,970
Oh.

589
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,350
Some of these...

590
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:14,850
Some of these...

591
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,330
Uh...

592
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,710
Some of these jazzy songs...

593
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,050
I will save for...

594
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,370
For what my voice is...

595
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,350
I'm not even really supposed to be doing karaoke right now.

596
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,150
But...

597
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,250
I was like...

598
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,810
I need something to just kind of like...

599
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,390
Release my emotions.

600
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:33,890
You know?

601
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,790
Wait...

602
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,770
I don't know.

603
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,210
Anyway.

604
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,850
Let's do...

605
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:43,710
Let's do this one.

606
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,150
You know what?

607
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,870
I can do this one.

608
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,110
Wait.

609
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,610
Hold on.

610
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:52,870
Uh...

611
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,610
This one just showed up.

612
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,450
Oh, okay.

613
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,190
It was the right one.

614
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:58,470
Okay.

615
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,190
I'll try it.

616
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,750
I'll try it.

617
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,360
Don't worry.

618
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,340
It's not hurting my throat.

619
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,780
I don't know.

620
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,300
Somewhere...

621
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,480
Beyond the sea...

622
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,340
Somewhere...

623
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,580
Waiting for me...

624
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,340
My lover stands on golden sea...

625
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,780
And watches the ships...

626
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,340
Black coast sailing...

627
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,860
Somewhere...

628
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:45,000
Beyond the sea, she's there watching for me.

629
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:56,220
If I could fly like birds on high, then straight to her arms I'd go sailing.

630
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,680
It's far.

631
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,800
Wait.

632
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,820
Beyond the stars.

633
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,040
It's near.

634
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,580
Beyond the moon.

635
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,880
I know.

636
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,200
Oh gosh, it's going to get really high though for me.

637
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
Without a doubt.

638
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,200
My heart will leave me there soon.

639
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,780
Well, me.

640
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,880
Beyond the shore, we'll kiss just as before.

641
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,860
Happy we'll be beyond the sea.

642
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,260
Then never again, I'll go sailing.

643
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,350
I know.

644
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:12,730
I know.

645
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,150
Beyond the doubt.

646
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,530
Oh, my heart will leave me there soon.

647
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,630
We'll meet.

648
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,190
I know we'll meet.

649
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,690
Beyond the shore.

650
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,690
We'll kiss just as before.

651
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,770
Happy we'll be beyond the sea.

652
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,470
And never again, I'll go sailing.

653
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,850
No more sailing.

654
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,690
So long, sailing.

655
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,030
Bye-bye, sailing.

656
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,430
Move on now, captain.

657
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,090
Have you ever played Bioshock?

658
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,790
I haven't.

659
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,110
Oh no!

660
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,650
No!

661
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,330
No!

662
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,570
No more Mickey Mouse!

663
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,630
No more... No!

664
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,510
Please let me... Okay.

665
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,570
Sorry.

666
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,430
Sorry for that.

667
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,630
Finding Minto.

668
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,450
Let me take a sip of my tea.

669
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,250
Let me take a sip of my tea.

670
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,240
Give us Donald!

671
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,800
I gotta get back to work.

672
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you!

673
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,720
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,220
Okay.

675
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Okay.

676
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,420
Um... Let's go, uh, here.

677
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,220
I kinda want more, like, goofy songs that I can...

678
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,880
Just kinda be, like, silly, you know?

679
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,060
I'm getting sleepy too.

680
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,380
I gotta rest up.

681
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,080
For the concert!

682
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,180
Scary.

683
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,240
Scary!

684
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Scary!

685
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,240
Oh my gosh.

686
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,810
Let's see.

687
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,410
What's another song we could do?

688
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,390
What's another song?

689
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,910
What's under pop?

690
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,190
Wait, my chat froze.

691
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,130
Oh, do you think...

692
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,190
Well, how stereotypical YouTube...

693
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,890
Eh?

694
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,390
Eh... Eh?

695
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,990
Break stuff, oh, yeah.

696
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:42,790
Hahahaha!

697
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:44,970
B12!

698
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,390
They don't have it!

699
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,230
Shot B12!

700
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,810
Let me... Oh!

701
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,130
Wait!

702
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,670
There we go.

703
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,470
You guys are back.

704
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:55,770
Okay.

705
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
A thousand miles.

706
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,920
Yeah, we can do that.

707
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:09,680
A thousand... miles... Spooky Scary Skeletons!

708
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,840
I'll do that one after... Time after time.

709
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,820
Okay, I can do that.

710
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,500
Crepe by RabioHead.

711
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,600
Why is this not loading?

712
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,760
Gosh, it's... Oh, here we go.

713
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,080
Okay.

714
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay, Spooky Scary Skeletons.

715
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,880
I'll add that to the queue.

716
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,840
Crepe.

717
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,760
Oh!

718
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,800
Wait.

719
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,640
Wait.

720
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,040
Am I... I am back?

721
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I am?

722
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,320
We're back?

723
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,360
Hold on.

724
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,840
Nothing is loading.

725
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,680
There we go.

726
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,760
This is, yeah, terrible.

727
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,360
I'm gone!

728
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm a creep.

729
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
Crepe.

730
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,360
I'm a desert.

731
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:33,820
I'm filled with strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream.

732
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,460
Hmm...

733
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:34,720
Hmm...
