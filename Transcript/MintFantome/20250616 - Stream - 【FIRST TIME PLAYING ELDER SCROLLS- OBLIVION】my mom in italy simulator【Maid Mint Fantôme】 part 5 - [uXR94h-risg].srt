1
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,780
Oops, I forgot to turn the sound on.

2
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,220
Hold on.

3
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,740
I didn't set up anything.

4
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,380
Okay, I set it up.

5
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,140
Welcome,

6
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,100
everybody.

7
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,880
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
Hello, hello, hello.

9
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,560
Welcome back to Oblivion.

10
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,400
Yeah!

11
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
What

12
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,710
did we do last time?

13
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,890
Welcome.

14
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,950
Can I have your blessing to marry Etina?

15
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,610
No!

16
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,610
It goes against her parole!

17
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,770
She cannot get married!

18
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,310
She cannot have a relationship.

19
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,090
Despite everything, you're still such a kind soul.

20
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,810
What did I do?

21
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,790
I don't think I'm so kind.

22
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,930
I'm an evil ghost, actually.

23
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,610
Did you not see the title of the stream?

24
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,530
Some people are probably like, what are you talking about?

25
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,270
Mom in Italy simulator.

26
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,350
What does that mean?

27
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,730
It's something I talked about.

28
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,090
Title may be confusing the non-members.

29
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,930
I'm already... I'm working on it!

30
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,990
I'm talking about it!

31
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,570
Give me a second!

32
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,250
Jeez!

33
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,310
Jeez!

34
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,630
Jeez!

35
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,260
Oh, gosh!

36
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,780
No, I'm gonna leave you guys hanging, maybe.

37
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,200
Wee!

38
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Thank you for the super time!

39
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you!

40
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm still trying to remember what happened last stream.

41
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,560
Evil ghost haunt me tonight.

42
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,600
I think he was mean just looking at her in that corner.

43
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,320
Hehehehehehe.

44
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,600
Yeah!

45
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,460
Hehehehehe!

46
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,940
Anyway...

47
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Anyway...

48
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,020
Um...

49
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,840
Uh...

50
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,920
I told this story last night in a members stream.

51
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,800
But, um...

52
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
My mom went to Italy...

53
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,600
My mom went to Italy recently...

54
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,160
And...

55
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,380
Um...

56
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,440
Well, what she told me a couple months ago that she was going...

57
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,860
She's like, I'm going with a tour group with my friends.

58
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,620
And I was like...

59
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,340
Okay!

60
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,120
Have fun, mom!

61
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,200
But also be careful.

62
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,940
Because my...

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,480
My...

64
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,200
Impression of Italy...

65
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Is that one lady on TikTok that goes...

66
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,700
Attention, pickpocket!

67
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,480
Attention, pickpocket!

68
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
And I was like...

69
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,860
Be careful of the pickpockets, mom.

70
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,540
And she's like...

71
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:31,820
Okay!

72
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,220
I got a special purse!

73
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,380
I got a special purse, so...

74
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll be fine!

75
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,140
And I was like...

76
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,300
Okay!

77
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,000
And...

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,320
She texted me Wednesday...

79
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,980
And she said...

80
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm leaving for Italy!

81
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,900
And I said...

82
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,220
Okay!

83
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,760
Have fun!

84
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,200
And then Thursday, she texted me and she said...

85
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
I just landed in Italy!

86
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,740
And I said...

87
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,160
Okay!

88
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,080
Be safe!

89
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,700
And Friday...

90
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,360
I get a text from an unknown number that says...

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,020
This is mom!

92
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,260
Not a scam!

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,160
My phone and my bag got pickpocketed!

94
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,990
Casey!

95
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,230
Thank you so much for the vibe!

96
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,070
Good to take you!

97
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,270
Attention, pickpocket!

98
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,730
I'm so sorry!

99
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,850
I'm not singing right now because of my voice!

100
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,750
But Happy Birthday!

101
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,110
Happy, happy birthday!

102
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:43,970
Happy, happy birthday!

103
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:44,730
Happy,

104
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:56,550
happy birthday!

105
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,010
You're like, oh, I wonder if this is how she felt... when she got her money stolen.

106
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,250
Maybe I think it's better than five gifted.

107
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,950
And it's not that I'm laughing about my mom getting pickpocketed.

108
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,310
I'm laughing about how fast it happened.

109
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,250
I'm laughing about how she went and she was there for one day and it happened.

110
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,770
It's so funny, Gray Fox got her, truly.

111
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,050
Truly, truly.

112
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,910
One day, she couldn't even last a single day.

113
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,990
Robbing American tourists is the number one European pastime.

114
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,210
Sorry, your mom had to learn through the culturally immersive way.

115
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,630
I told her to be careful.

116
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,290
This is not a scam.

117
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,850
14 months are not pickpockets.

118
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,430
Mel-chan, thank you.

119
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,150
Also, Tree goes, happy early birthday.

120
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,370
Now I can't remember, though, what we did last stream.

121
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,130
Also, V, thank you so much for the super chat.

122
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,030
You have violated the law.

123
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,880
One twist would be if your mom texts you in stream and she's turned to a thrilling life of pickpocketing on her own.

124
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,700
Yeah.

125
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,460
But knowing my mom is like such an easy target.

126
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,680
My mom's a really, really easy target.

127
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,800
So...

128
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,900
Honestly, I'm not so surprised.

129
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,200
Lost in the store, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

130
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,340
Thank you!

131
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,300
Rikadan, welcome back.

132
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,820
Thank you.

133
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,820
Steals 100 gold.

134
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
Thinking of you, mama.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,600
Exactly.

136
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Just like Italy, mamma mia.

137
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,440
Hold on.

138
00:10:59,540 --> 00:10:59,660
Hold on.

139
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,940
You guys want some ASMR...

140
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,720
Um...

141
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,300
Opening a can of coffee ASMR?

142
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,780
Would you like that?

143
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,560
Yes?

144
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,160
Let me turn off the music.

145
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,300
Can you hear that?

146
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,680
Can you hear the can?

147
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay.

148
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm gonna open it.

149
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,200
I...

150
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,020
I...

151
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,840
I can't get my finger under it.

152
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,000
That was clean!

153
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,140
Ah, nice!

154
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,000
Mmm...

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,020
Yummy coffee.

156
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,500
And this one is made with the oat milk, so it's so...

157
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,440
Delicioso.

158
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,520
Sounds like beer?

159
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
I tried beer.

160
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't really like it.

161
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,700
Lucky, thanks for the gift.

162
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,000
Dude!

163
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,640
It was really hot.

164
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
Make you think of, uh...

165
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,660
Opening up, uh...

166
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,300
Can of Coke on a hot day.

167
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,740
Congratulations on successfully opening coffee.

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,020
Thank you, beer o'clock.

169
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
Everybody, don't go swimming now, okay?

170
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,440
Wait.

171
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,180
Which way?

172
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,500
Wait.

173
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,020
No, order of operations.

174
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,260
No s...

175
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,660
Wait.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,500
Uh...

177
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,840
It was beer after swim.

178
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,760
Don't swim and drink.

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,060
Don't drink and swim, everybody.

180
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,120
You'll get a...

181
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,160
A SUI.

182
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,000
Swimming under the influence.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,020
Yeah.

184
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,280
Hope you guys have fun pickpocketing tonight.

185
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,920
It's my birthday!

186
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,540
Bye!

187
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,340
Happy birthday!

188
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,340
Happy, happy birthday!

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,580
Coffee opening level has increased.

190
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,460
Yes.

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,820
Why does a SUI sound like a...

192
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,960
Like something...

193
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,540
You would get during naughty time.

194
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,660
A sui!

195
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,420
Sounds like an infection.

196
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,680
No, that's what I'm saying.

197
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,540
Like a disease.

198
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,740
SUI.

199
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,950
Okay.

200
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,690
Maybe we should just...

201
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,130
Continue the game and see where we left off.

202
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,870
There is one thing I want to do today.

203
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,910
I want to finally kill those people.

204
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,250
And finish that one quest.

205
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,750
With the guy.

206
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,590
We're eating our level 7.

207
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,170
Guys, you know what's hilarious is...

208
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,270
I would be in Japan.

209
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:18,930
Where...

210
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,550
What was I doing here?

211
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,190
How do I play this game again?

212
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,430
I'm gonna...

213
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,030
I'm standing here.

214
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,770
I'm gonna get attacked by a crab.

215
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,130
Um...

216
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,770
I bought a brand new movie on Blu-Ray, Shrinkwreck, and everything.

217
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,630
Guess what?

218
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,110
The darn thing was skip and freezing.

219
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,770
Ew.

220
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,930
Is it your player?

221
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,890
Thieves Guild.

222
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,370
Oh yeah, we did do that, didn't we?

223
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,970
Um...

224
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,110
But while I was in Japan, there were so many...

225
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,130
ET...

226
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,910
T-shirts.

227
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,970
And I just...

228
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,750
I couldn't...

229
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,920
I wanted to buy so many of them.

230
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,020
Because what are the odds?

231
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,920
What are the odds?

232
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,200
That...

233
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,320
I create ET that...

234
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
And then ET is popular again.

235
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,470
ET phone home.

236
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,490
Oh.

237
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,510
Who are you?

238
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,650
ET phone home.

239
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,970
It is one phone call...

240
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,270
After getting in jail.

241
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,670
So we are...

242
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,310
What time is it?

243
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,130
Oh gosh, how do I see you again?

244
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,030
Oh, I just did something.

245
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,030
I clicked C for clock.

246
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,810
Maybe T for time.

247
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,130
Oh, there we go.

248
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,410
It is 2 AM.

249
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,990
Good to see you again.

250
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,770
C for cast.

251
00:15:59,710 --> 00:15:59,930
Oh.

252
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,070
Oh, I have no finds and bounty.

253
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,930
I'm okay, I think.

254
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,090
Shadow hide you.

255
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,190
Shadow hide you.

256
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,030
Oh, puny.

257
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,530
I think these were the...

258
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,710
Oh yeah, I killed your captain.

259
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,990
I remember doing that.

260
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,990
Are you gonna sing?

261
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh hey, sweet lady of mine.

262
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,450
Oh hey, sweet lady of mine.

263
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,990
Oh, I'll see you again.

264
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,110
Yes, I'll see you again.

265
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,910
Sweet lady of mine.

266
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,190
We were so fine.

267
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,090
Gosh, I...

268
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,590
I almost ran out of breath in that one.

269
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,190
I was just trying to keep up with him.

270
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:37,590
Okay.

271
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,430
The guy we were trying to murder...

272
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,110
Was in...

273
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,850
Wait, what's going on here?

274
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,460
Why is it so foggy?

275
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,360
I can't see anything.

276
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,220
I swear I've run up and down this city.

277
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,120
Have I not?

278
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,980
Maybe not.

279
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,700
Oh wait, this is me!

280
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,840
Oh, this is...

281
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,540
I thought I was zooming into here.

282
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,680
Into here.

283
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,180
What are these?

284
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,180
Sorry, it's gonna take me a second to get back up to...

285
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,560
Get back up to speed of where we are and how to play this game.

286
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,080
Try to clean your glasses.

287
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,860
I got new glasses!

288
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,240
But I think they're too strong.

289
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,660
I feel like I'm in a fishbowl every time I put them on.

290
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:35,780
Where they are.

291
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,530
The one where you rob the church.

292
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,950
Steal the bust.

293
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,470
Of...

294
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,270
Of...

295
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,310
Latasa Indaris.

296
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,410
From...

297
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,390
Cheyendoll.

298
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,190
That's right!

299
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,010
We need like a buttload of money.

300
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,270
Because...

301
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,050
I want to buy that haunted house.

302
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,910
LASIK gang...

303
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,430
Scary!

304
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,310
Only a hundred coins?

305
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,310
That's what I'm thinking too.

306
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,550
Hold on, let's go back to... What was it?

307
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,130
Paranoia?

308
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,150
Yeah.

309
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,510
One thousand septums.

310
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:18,690
Okay.

311
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:25,930
Yes.

312
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,950
And it's night time, so this is perfect.

313
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,970
We'll just fast travel.

314
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,310
Minton Heights.

315
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,610
Yeah, we gotta kill the toadiest sextiers.

316
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,370
Is it raining?

317
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,770
Perfect.

318
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,450
The rain will wash away the blood.

319
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,410
Wait.

320
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,970
In here?

321
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,390
West Weild.

322
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,590
No.

323
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,170
Get me inside the city.

324
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,570
Please.

325
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,250
Where do I go inside the city?

326
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,800
West Weild.

327
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
Where do I get inside the city?

328
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,600
West Weild.

329
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Oh?

330
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,170
I'm lost.

331
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,630
Why is this so confusing?

332
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,570
You are inside.

333
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,590
SkinGrad is weird.

334
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,230
Is it?

335
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,090
Am I inside?

336
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,670
Maybe now I'm outside?

337
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm not gonna get... Wait.

338
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,190
Why is it looking...

339
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,510
It's already 6am?

340
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,410
I think I missed my chance...

341
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,310
To kill in the dark.

342
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,550
Everybody's gonna be awake in like...

343
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,150
An hour.

344
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,350
Wait.

345
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,310
Maybe if I go up here...

346
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,070
We'll sleep with your stream on...

347
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,790
Good night, Tolkien.

348
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,870
Good night.

349
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,610
Thank you.

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,640
That's right.

351
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm a sniper.

352
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,780
Everybody remember that?

353
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,940
Oh, I thought that was a...

354
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,540
Open portal for a second.

355
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,040
I don't think Elder Scrolls people are that early.

356
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,600
They are.

357
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,780
I remember.

358
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,420
Okay.

359
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,900
We're at the farm.

360
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,180
Okay.

361
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,080
I know where we are.

362
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,500
I remember.

363
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:43,760
I remember.

364
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,100
These horses are not mine.

365
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,420
What are the sheep doing?

366
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:50,760
Oh.

367
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,160
That guy's leading them.

368
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,980
Who are you?

369
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,480
He doesn't want...

370
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
He does not want anything to do with me.

371
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,560
You guys are lagging behind.

372
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,080
Sheep.

373
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,480
They're so slow.

374
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,060
What's that over there?

375
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,300
That's not a portal, is it?

376
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,560
Why is he four foot three?

377
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,500
Etina is just huge.

378
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,060
Wait, where did he go?

379
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,420
Oh, he's your sheep.

380
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,800
He's the worst herder ever.

381
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,440
He's just...

382
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,090
They'll never catch a sheep.

383
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,230
I wonder where they're going anyway.

384
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:48,610
Okay.

385
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,730
We have a duty.

386
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,250
Look, they're already up and at them.

387
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,030
Who are you?

388
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,650
Tilmo.

389
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,950
You need to see Ugak if you want to buy a horse.

390
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,230
She's inside.

391
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,850
Nah, I have a better horse.

392
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,530
Rumors.

393
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,510
Magra Mogak runs a fine establishment at the Two Sisters Lodge.

394
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,130
And her sister has some quality horses.

395
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,930
Oh.

396
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,970
Stop talking.

397
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:12,950
Okay.

398
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,950
How are you?

399
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,970
He says, I haven't had my coffee yet.

400
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,410
Everybody's so rude in this game.

401
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,170
Wait a second.

402
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,390
I'm inside.

403
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:28,830
I'm inside.

404
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm inside.

405
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,290
I'm inside.

406
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,470
Good morning.

407
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,310
Hello.

408
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,630
Okay.

409
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,770
We are inside.

410
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,570
Now I just have to murder.

411
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,190
Tutius Sextius.

412
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,950
He lives there.

413
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,990
I remember his house.

414
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,150
He's actually got quite a nice looking house.

415
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,990
Oh, I can go in.

416
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,490
Wait, who are you?

417
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,370
A coin for an old beggar.

418
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:57,850
Nah.

419
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,610
Oh wait, but he'll tell me the secrets of stealing.

420
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,740
How do I put my weapon away again?

421
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,640
Oh, there we go.

422
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,820
Come in unassuming.

423
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,680
Okay.

424
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,980
Do you guys think I still remember how to pickpocket?

425
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,820
I mean...

426
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,020
Lick...

427
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,240
No.

428
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,690
Why do I do this every time?

429
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,460
Why do I do this every time?

430
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,340
How goes it?

431
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,220
Hello.

432
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,900
Do you think anybody will hear his screams?

433
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,300
I was gonna say...

434
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,680
Lock pick.

435
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,950
Oh, golly.

436
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,350
How are you?

437
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,390
Go ahead, please.

438
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,570
Um...

439
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,210
Rumors.

440
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,110
Oh, I can't say about Glarther.

441
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,450
Cannot say.

442
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,550
Mr. Freud needs to be consulted.

443
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,050
No!

444
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,610
That guy's a hack.

445
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,810
Hey, you're the one they call the hero of Kvatch, aren't you?

446
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,150
The one that closed the oblivion gate and saved the city.

447
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,150
Yeah.

448
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,890
So you should trust me.

449
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,670
Good day.

450
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,490
Good day.

451
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,640
F5 is quick save?

452
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,880
Right?

453
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,160
Thank you.

454
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,220
Now we have to wait for him to forget about us.

455
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
And we're just gonna stay up here, you know?

456
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,500
And make it so that he can't see us.

457
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,040
And then we'll get that sneak bonus for our...

458
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,860
For the first shot.

459
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,540
My middle name is Pocket.

460
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,940
I don't believe you.

461
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,310
So you can add another person who likes Culver's.

462
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,670
Tried a Butter Burger while vacationing in Ohio.

463
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,330
Liked it a lot.

464
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,170
What's your favorite dish there?

465
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,910
I haven't...

466
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,530
Oh my gosh.

467
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,690
I have not been to...

468
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,290
A Culver's in so long.

469
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,830
I do remember liking their Butter Burger though.

470
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,770
I hear Lick Pocking is an epidemic in Italy.

471
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,410
You think I can get him now?

472
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,470
Okay.

473
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,670
I quick saved.

474
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,270
Let's try.

475
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,810
What's going on?

476
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,050
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death.

477
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,890
Where are you going?

478
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,050
Wait, don't leave.

479
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,890
Don't leave.

480
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,250
Don't leave.

481
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:04,570
Don't leave.

482
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,490
Don't leave.

483
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:05,950
Shoot.

484
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,110
Don't leave.

485
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,330
Uh oh.

486
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,130
It's all over, Law Breaker.

487
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,970
Your spree is at an end.

488
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,350
I'll take any stolen goods you have.

489
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,670
I didn't steal anything!

490
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,410
Next room is yours.

491
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,970
Pay your fine.

492
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,130
Or I'll haul you away.

493
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,550
I could just pay the gold.

494
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,510
Oh, that's right.

495
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,870
I was going to use the special.

496
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,410
Then pay with your blood.

497
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,050
I think he died.

498
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,870
Oh.

499
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,550
Oh, there he is.

500
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,510
He's still alive.

501
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,050
Oh.

502
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,610
Oh.

503
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,530
He's still alive.

504
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,450
Oh, oh, oh.

505
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:46,850
I'm stuck.

506
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,490
I'm stuck.

507
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,870
What's up?

508
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
How did he...

509
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,300
How did he live?

510
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,470
Look at him with his little fists up.

511
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,510
You want to die too?

512
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,370
I'll kill this whole city.

513
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,190
Okay.

514
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,890
What was that?

515
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,990
What was the quick load?

516
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,010
Is that one HP?

517
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,890
Someone's been murdered.

518
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,750
Someone's been murdered.

519
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,390
What is that guy?

520
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,750
What did I do to you?

521
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,290
I'm just warming up, you pathetic worms.

522
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,070
F9.

523
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,230
Thank you.

524
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,260
Okay.

525
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,840
Let's see.

526
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,060
Inventory.

527
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,560
Maybe...

528
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,280
What's the arrow of dispel?

529
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,420
We need like a poison arrow.

530
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,960
I don't think I know how to make them, though.

531
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,920
Hey, Q.

532
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,980
I've seen you.

533
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Let me see your face.

534
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,120
You were the one from my dreams.

535
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,840
Oh my gosh, it's Uriel!

536
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,300
Don't die, Uriel.

537
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,150
Use poison in inventory.

538
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,190
Check if you have any poisons.

539
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,730
In here.

540
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,710
Poison of illness.

541
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,270
I have a poison.

542
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:34,990
Oh.

543
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,770
Damaged health on...

544
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,330
Self.

545
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,110
I don't think that's what...

546
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,890
Is good.

547
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,930
Wait, this works?

548
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,190
Use it?

549
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,590
Apply it to a weapon.

550
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,590
You put it on the weapons.

551
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,500
So if I use it...

552
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,680
Okay.

553
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,280
If I...

554
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,920
If I use it wrong, I can always reload.

555
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,610
Yes.

556
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,570
Aha!

557
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,530
Okay.

558
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:18,770
Okay.

559
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,950
Let's see if this does the job, then.

560
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,700
I also have these, but these are weak.

561
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
Weak potions.

562
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,800
Weak poisons.

563
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,300
Weak, weak, weak.

564
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,300
Help!

565
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,150
I'm being attacked!

566
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,370
Oh.

567
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,290
I think because he yells, they hear.

568
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,350
Oops.

569
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,610
They're gonna come in.

570
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,130
Oh, and he laughed.

571
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,040
What?

572
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,520
The bouncy moments in Togos of Chibi Man are the cutest.

573
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,240
Thank you!

574
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,640
Ah!

575
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,380
This guy is...

576
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,260
So...

577
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,060
Beefy!

578
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,620
He's like a cow!

579
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,680
Dagger typically has...

580
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,900
More sneak damage.

581
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,560
Okay.

582
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,700
So if I poison with a dagger, it should be better.

583
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,180
Maybe.

584
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,040
Do I have a dagger?

585
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,900
Probably.

586
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,460
Blade of Woe?

587
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
Ah, yeah.

588
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,590
Wait, I used it?

589
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,410
I think it worked.

590
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,470
How do I kill him?

591
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,470
How do I kill him?

592
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,210
By the Nines of Lines!

593
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,910
Assault!

594
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,490
Assault!

595
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:03,750
Ah!

596
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,570
Oh!

597
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,530
Oh!

598
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,600
He's so...

599
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,400
He is so beefy!

600
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
He's so beefy!

601
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,200
Charge your attack.

602
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,880
Okay, hold on.

603
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,860
Let's try again.

604
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,780
He's so beefy!

605
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,160
Okay.

606
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,760
Alright.

607
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,100
Oh, there he is.

608
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,220
Oh, he blends in with the wall.

609
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
For real.

610
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Is my blade of woe the best thing?

611
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,840
I got the katana.

612
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,080
I think it is the best thing I've got.

613
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,540
Suffer thorn?

614
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,440
Where is that?

615
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,260
Oh, this one!

616
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Oh, thank you.

617
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,860
Oh, yeah, you're right.

618
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,540
Okay, good.

619
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,680
Good eyes, everybody.

620
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,300
Good eyes.

621
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,820
Good eyes.

622
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,340
So how do I charge an attack?

623
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,190
Hold.

624
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:15,870
Hold.

625
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,010
Hold the attack button down.

626
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,410
Oh, God.

627
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,110
Thank you, guys.

628
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,050
Alright.

629
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,850
I'm charging.

630
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,150
Uh...

631
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,090
I don't think it's working.

632
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,350
Dang!

633
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,310
This is good, though.

634
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,530
Oh!

635
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,650
I got him.

636
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,830
You think I can leave?

637
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,390
Maybe if I, like, leave out a window, they'll never know it's me.

638
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,750
Go.

639
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,790
Go, go, go, go, go.

640
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,950
There are no windows I can leave.

641
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,890
Oh, shoot.

642
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,010
Can I hide under the bed?

643
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,550
Sleep.

644
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:00,650
Um...

645
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,210
Shoot.

646
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,050
Wait,

647
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,580
how...

648
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Nobody came.

649
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,420
Uh-oh.

650
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,480
Uh-oh.

651
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,020
Uh-oh.

652
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,460
Nope.

653
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,600
Nope.

654
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:31,250
Nope.

655
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,950
Stop right there, criminal scum.

656
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,370
Nobody breaks the law on my watch.

657
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,650
I'm confiscating your stolen goods.

658
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,490
Now pay your fine, or it's off to jail.

659
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,270
I did it!

660
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,270
I didn't!

661
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,370
I didn't!

662
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,070
I didn't!

663
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,310
I didn't!

664
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,870
I didn't rob him!

665
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,590
I didn't rob him!

666
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,050
Ugh!

667
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,100
Ugh!

668
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,750
I feel...

669
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,250
I'm like...

670
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,190
If I keep paying the fines, I'm not gonna make any money, you know?

671
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,130
How...

672
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,590
How am I supposed to make the...

673
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,750
Raise the money I need for the house if I can't kill this guy?

674
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,380
They take your stolen goods, too?

675
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,440
I think I sold all my stolen goods.

676
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,020
So I think I'm okay.

677
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,230
Aww...

678
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,050
Pay the thieves' guild for half the bounty.

679
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,590
What, if I...

680
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,790
Resist?

681
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,170
If I resist and...

682
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:52,690
I run?

683
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,490
And then I go to the...

684
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,020
Are I doing it at night?

685
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,420
Yeah, maybe.

686
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,320
Resist and go to the thieves' guild.

687
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,580
I would have to run so far.

688
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,980
I would have to go so far.

689
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,560
Okay.

690
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,110
But also, I'm only gonna get paid a thousand.

691
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,570
So, if it's a thousand forty...

692
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,590
Each time I get caught...

693
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:38,930
Then...

694
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,150
I make no money back.

695
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,420
What does jail...

696
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,960
What is the...

697
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,220
What is the bad side of jail?

698
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,300
I get free food.

699
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,280
Hold on, mister.

700
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm having an internal...

701
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,560
Conflict...

702
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,160
In my brain.

703
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,660
That's right.

704
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,460
You lose stats.

705
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:05,900
That's right.

706
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,460
That's right.

707
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,240
That's right.

708
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,280
A Minto ran...

709
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
He ran so far away...

710
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,760
Crime doesn't pay, Minto.

711
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,060
So...

712
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,680
I've committed to this life.

713
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,380
Hope you rot, criminal scum.

714
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,040
Cool.

715
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,220
Let's see what we lose.

716
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,580
My clothes!

717
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,700
Etina, you're indecent.

718
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,350
Average, you say?

719
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,230
I...

720
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,190
I still got it, baby.

721
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,740
Anyone else in here?

722
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,880
No one else?

723
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,180
This looks like it could be exploded.

724
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,200
Oh, see?

725
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,020
She goes right in.

726
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn't do it!

727
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,020
Where's my stuff?

728
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,680
I think I should reload.

729
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,270
Well now...

730
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,850
What do we have here?

731
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,270
Caught in the act and no gold.

732
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,470
To pay your fine.

733
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,590
I'm confiscating your stolen goods.

734
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,310
Now it's off to jail with ya.

735
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,870
Then pay with your blood!

736
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,690
What's the matter?

737
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,930
Getting tired?

738
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,330
Where am I?

739
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,710
Oh, I'm...

740
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,210
Here!

741
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,150
Okay, F9.

742
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,190
Where am...

743
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,890
Where does...

744
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,370
Oh, we're back here!

745
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,090
It was all a dream.

746
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,390
Ha!

747
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,270
Okay.

748
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:44,730
Good morning.

749
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,830
Good morning.

750
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,190
I'll come back for you, Tutius.

751
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,830
I still have to remember where the other two were.

752
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,730
It was all a dream!

753
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,850
Okay, uh...

754
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,870
We're trying to kill...

755
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,720
Where's the other one?

756
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,410
Oh...

757
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,510
Uh...

758
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,390
Center, answer, caves, camps, forts.

759
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,110
That's so boring, though!

760
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,710
Hey!

761
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,450
What is it?

762
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,030
You're the lady that likes...

763
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,230
Necromancy!

764
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,690
What can I do for you?

765
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,550
Are you on my team?

766
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,810
Hmm...

767
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,210
I don't know.

768
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,610
Never seen that sort of route before.

769
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,610
Good day.

770
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,810
You can do quests.

771
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,710
That's what we're doing right now, baby!

772
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,030
Wait, where am I?

773
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,010
Oh...

774
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:00,610
Took us...

775
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,370
Wait, over here.

776
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,070
Who is that?

777
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:03,790
Who is that?

778
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:03,950
Sh...

779
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,250
Shmear's house.

780
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,210
Shmear?

781
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,030
Is that another person?

782
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,190
Oh, here we go.

783
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:10,690
Um...

784
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,590
No time to talk.

785
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,190
Okay, we can't talk to you, Glarther.

786
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,600
Oh, yes!

787
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,140
That's right!

788
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,200
There was one he...

789
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,540
Like...

790
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,800
Uh...

791
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,560
Here?

792
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,540
Bernadette?

793
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,080
Is one person?

794
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,640
And then, who are you?

795
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,100
Good morning.

796
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,460
Daveed!

797
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,580
Yeah!

798
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,860
Have you tried to get a job?

799
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,500
A blibber burger?

800
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,260
My talents would be wasted flipping burgers.

801
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,820
Is this his house?

802
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:51,840
Yes!

803
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,120
Daveed had the brother!

804
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,980
Daveed had the brother.

805
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,920
I'm not talking to you.

806
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,080
Oh, wait.

807
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,860
Shmear.

808
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,540
Am I supposed to kill you?

809
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:05,820
No.

810
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,020
Supposed to kill Bernadette...

811
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,090
And Daveed...

812
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,450
And...

813
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,650
Tutius Sextius.

814
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,480
Why do the guards have such good hearing?

815
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,450
I remember Daveed being hard too, because what am I supposed to do about his brother?

816
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,510
How do people do this quest?

817
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,640
How?

818
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,060
Accept the bounty consequences in jail.

819
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,420
After everyone is dead, chaos must flow.

820
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,850
Waiting till they're asleep, yeah.

821
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,770
geek.

822
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,930
What?

823
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,010
Papa.

824
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,670
Papa Shamir.

825
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:22,350
I... I think what I was hoping, though, is that... Or rather... Okay, hold on.

826
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:27,710
Don't the characters level... Up with you?

827
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,010
You know?

828
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,950
So, if I... Get stronger, so do they.

829
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,970
Some of them.

830
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,550
NPCs don't.

831
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,190
Not town NPCs, generally.

832
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,710
Oh.

833
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,590
The spawned mob still.

834
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,730
Oh.

835
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,100
So, maybe... Maybe I come back at, like, level 10.

836
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,670
I'm 7.

837
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,130
20 as sexy as level cap is 17!

838
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,190
Okay.

839
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,190
Let's see... Let's see how beefy they are.

840
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,670
Let's do, like, 15 hours.

841
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,730
14 hours.

842
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,650
E-Tina just standing in the streets.

843
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,270
She's dummy thick.

844
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:38,790
No!

845
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,390
Can freely take novice alchemy gear.

846
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,730
Sell back to them for a sharp knife.

847
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,490
Heiko had a pretty good knife, though.

848
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:46,830
Oh, wait.

849
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,570
It's only 10pm.

850
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:51,730
That's just now.

851
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:51,730
Oh.

852
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,750
Look at him!

853
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,130
Come...

854
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,410
Fuck!

855
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:07,450
Let's do, like, five hours.

856
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,850
Let's try.

857
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,870
I just wanna try!

858
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,310
Worth using that fancy melee weapon in some dungeons?

859
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,090
Yeah, I just think it's so fun to kill.

860
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,650
What are you doing?

861
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,370
Can you spare a coin?

862
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:24,970
No.

863
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,090
I have to kill this lady.

864
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,550
Can you get out of here?

865
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:29,790
Thank you.

866
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:30,850
Nobody around?

867
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,290
Okay.

868
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,000
I got it, baby.

869
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,940
I got it, baby.

870
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:47,920
Okay.

871
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:47,940
Okay.

872
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,180
I also need...

873
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,540
Oh, whoops.

874
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,600
Well, this is fine.

875
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,500
Let's change...

876
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,260
Let's change to...

877
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,720
Back to this.

878
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,540
I don't know.

879
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,500
My bow is way stronger, though.

880
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,660
Drain strength.

881
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,960
Damage health on strength.

882
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,400
Oh, wait.

883
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:04,980
10 points.

884
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,940
Okay, I'll try it.

885
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,940
And then we'll also...

886
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,900
Do the poison.

887
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,840
Oh, wait.

888
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,320
Hold on.

889
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,320
Let me quick save.

890
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,700
Potion of illness.

891
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,980
Because even if I can just kill one...

892
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,900
That'll be nicer for the rest.

893
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:33,640
You know?

894
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,320
Is that her?

895
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,040
Yes.

896
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,540
I tried charging, you guys.

897
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,540
You saw what happened.

898
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,860
It didn't charge at all.

899
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,640
It didn't charge at all.

900
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,370
Oh, it did?

901
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,030
Okay.

902
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,520
I don't believe you.

903
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,200
By the gods, there's a psychopath on the loose!

904
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,600
You

905
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,690
think they'll know it's me?

906
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,370
Oh, this is not...

907
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,030
There's no window.

908
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,810
I need to start planning my escape routes, you know?

909
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,320
So far, so good?

910
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,400
Good morning!

911
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,100
So far, so good!

912
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,600
Oh...

913
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,380
Oh!

914
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,330
Oh!

915
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:12,870
Oh my god!

916
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,510
We did it!

917
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,870
We did it!

918
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,440
Oh my god!

919
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,540
We did it!

920
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,430
Good job, team!

921
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,170
Good job, team!

922
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,630
We got away with it.

923
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:32,530
We got away with it.

924
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,530
We got away with it.

925
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,190
Okay, I'm safe.

926
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,960
Oh!

927
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,880
Oh my gosh.

928
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,700
I'm on that murder high.

929
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,200
See?

930
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,720
Oh, wait.

931
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,500
This is not Tutius' house.

932
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,540
Tutius...

933
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,600
Let's see how close he's got, like, some...

934
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,160
Wait.

935
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,000
Who's over here?

936
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,720
Let's see how close the guards are to his house, you know?

937
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,440
Wait, what is this?

938
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,980
Oh, it's just a fire.

939
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,080
One moment, sir.

940
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,980
Oh, here, here, here, here.

941
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,140
There's that guy.

942
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,900
I think it's this guy that gets me every time.

943
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,360
I think.

944
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,760
This is the guy that, like...

945
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,380
What is it now?

946
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,260
That, like, hears him scream.

947
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,220
Hmm.

948
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,860
And then...

949
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,920
We have some patrollers.

950
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,700
What time was it?

951
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,860
5.30.

952
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,560
And then for...

953
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,920
The brothers...

954
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,380
The brothers...

955
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,860
Where were they?

956
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,700
Where were they?

957
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,420
Wait, why don't they show up?

958
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,050
Eh?

959
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:13,230
Heh heh.

960
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:13,950
Eh?

961
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:16,710
Huh?

962
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,040
Casually ignores the police to help starving children.

963
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,360
Yeah.

964
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,180
Yeah.

965
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,580
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

966
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,160
Here, here, here.

967
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:28,740
Here.

968
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,960
And there's also a guard parked right there.

969
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,320
No.

970
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:42,820
Tricky.

971
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,320
They make it tricky, huh?

972
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,860
Whose house is this?

973
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh, the Two Sisters Lodge.

974
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,960
Two of them.

975
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,300
Markinus, welcome to membership.

976
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,260
Thank you so much.

977
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,060
Thank you.

978
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,180
Thank you.

979
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,190
Can you wait it out inside the house after killing it?

980
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,590
Well, the guards come in.

981
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,030
You know?

982
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,200
Hmm.

983
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,860
Let's get...

984
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,580
Stronger and we'll come back.

985
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,840
We've killed one.

986
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,240
We've killed a woman.

987
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,000
What?

988
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,920
Larther, are you proud of me?

989
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,860
Can't you see that I'm very busy?

990
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,380
I told you not to speak to me in public.

991
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,000
We'll meet tonight at the place we discussed.

992
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,680
Not tonight.

993
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,940
Ah, sorry.

994
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,580
I have no idea what time it is.

995
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,900
Tootieus is probably the hardest.

996
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,100
I don't know.

997
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,860
Depending...

998
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,080
The brothers might be really hard too, because...

999
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,760
Because...

1000
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,560
I think I have to kill them both?

1001
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,460
I don't know.

1002
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,450
And then...

1003
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,110
I have to make more poison.

1004
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,330
I have to get more poison.

1005
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:09,610
Severing.

1006
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,670
Oh, Magicka.

1007
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,810
No, I know it's only one brother that I have to kill.

1008
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,890
But I feel like I have to give both of them so that they both shut up.

1009
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,850
I think the brothers might be the hardest.

1010
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,670
Anyway.

1011
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,030
Let's, um...

1012
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,870
We'll save the other two for later, once I'm stronger.

1013
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,530
What should we do now?

1014
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,370
How much gold do I have?

1015
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,350
2,396.

1016
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,150
Not bad.

1017
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:55,870
What did we need?

1018
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,070
Like, 5,000?

1019
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,230
It's like a crazy amount.

1020
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,250
This one.

1021
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,010
Where spirits have least.

1022
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,070
Should we go find a cave?

1023
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,170
5k for the house.

1024
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,780
No rest for the wicked.

1025
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,620
Oh, yeah.

1026
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,520
If we...

1027
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,560
We can also do the...

1028
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,420
Do our brothers and sisters.

1029
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,080
We can do that with a killing.

1030
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,320
Killing.

1031
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,260
Killing.

1032
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,040
Killing.

1033
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:41,760
Killing.

1034
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,520
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,680
This is the main quest.

1036
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,520
I forgot about that.

1037
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,550
If you off every single person thing in the game, it would technically resolve all storylines and be...

1038
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:57,930
I know.

1039
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,410
I know.

1040
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,690
Join the mages guild.

1041
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:03,490
Did I not do that?

1042
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,110
Let's go...

1043
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:06,770
Uh, what was it?

1044
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,330
Let's go back to...

1045
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,650
To Vampire Man.

1046
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,990
And go accept the quest.

1047
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:16,410
Yeah.

1048
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,320
Yes.

1049
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,940
What main quest?

1050
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,820
What main quest?

1051
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,620
Oh, hello.

1052
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,660
Good morning.

1053
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,480
Oh, hi-yo.

1054
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,500
Gozaimasu.

1055
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,380
Ah, how great.

1056
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,500
How do you do?

1057
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,400
How do you do?

1058
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,120
I look left.

1059
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,120
I look right.

1060
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,720
Nobody watch me go into the abandoned house.

1061
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,410
Walk the dark path of the brotherhood.

1062
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,660
I am.

1063
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,620
It's actually so spooky in here.

1064
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,350
End of the world can wait for real estate.

1065
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,970
I want to get my house and then we can...

1066
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,790
Then we can...

1067
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,170
Continue the main story.

1068
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,970
I don't know how long today's stream will be.

1069
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,190
Really just depends on how I feel.

1070
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,750
I'm kind of hot, though.

1071
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,950
I turn on my fan.

1072
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,380
Hello, Skelly.

1073
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,160
Hello.

1074
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,520
Hello, everybody.

1075
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,580
Skelly.

1076
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,640
Skelly.

1077
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,600
So good to see you.

1078
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,640
Is there anything you need?

1079
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,480
No.

1080
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,480
Um...

1081
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,420
Now I know that guy has hair.

1082
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,420
So...

1083
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,020
I'll recognize him.

1084
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,280
Is he in here?

1085
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,920
Oh.

1086
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,160
Yeah.

1087
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,420
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,320
Oh, it's Oceeva.

1089
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,120
That's right.

1090
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,710
I miss bald Vincent.

1091
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:13,310
Me too.

1092
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,730
I'm so...

1093
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,130
Sad.

1094
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,050
That they patched his hair.

1095
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,890
Why would they do that?

1096
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,310
At least we got it, you know?

1097
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,390
At least we got to see it.

1098
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,250
Whoa.

1099
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:32,610
Whoa.

1100
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,970
Well, everybody's asleep.

1101
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,190
Oh, this guy's a jerk.

1102
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,690
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.

1103
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,830
The little brow is clean in his face.

1104
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,130
Take a nap and level up.

1105
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,490
I don't have a level up.

1106
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,870
It appears as like a little icon.

1107
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,430
Maybe he's in his room.

1108
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,670
Maybe he's asleep too.

1109
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,790
Are you not an early riser?

1110
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,090
Cute, right?

1111
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,730
Yeah, he's so cute.

1112
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,610
I love that this place has pets.

1113
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,410
Oh, there you are.

1114
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,930
He looks so bad with his hair.

1115
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,630
Back for more?

1116
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:22,250
Yes.

1117
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,130
It just so happens I have another contract available.

1118
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,330
One that requires an expert in infiltration.

1119
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,790
Does he know?

1120
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,330
Of course, I will gladly accept.

1121
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,390
As always, you fail to disappoint me.

1122
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,190
Your target is a dark elf named Valen Dreath.

1123
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,590
He thinks he's safe in prison.

1124
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,790
He is tragically mistaken.

1125
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,390
You fail to disappoint you.

1126
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:53,410
A prisoner recently escaped from the prison using a set of secret tunnels connected to the Imperial City's sewer system.

1127
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,090
It's a perfect way inside.

1128
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:56,770
There's a mod that makes it permanent evolve.

1129
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,290
Just outside the Imperial prison is a grating that leads to the sewers.

1130
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:04,510
It has recently been tightly locked, but I will provide a key.

1131
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,470
It should be easy enough to locate Dreath in his small cell.

1132
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,690
Besides, I think you know the way, hmm?

1133
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,570
Valen Dreath has been imprisoned for many years.

1134
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:20,630
His tongue is sharp, but his body is limp and frail.

1135
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,210
He will prove an easy, pleasurable kill.

1136
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:29,190
You will receive a bonus if you fulfill the contract without killing any of the prison guards.

1137
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,570
Now go.

1138
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,910
And may the Night Mother go with you.

1139
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,930
No rest for the wicked completed.

1140
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,210
Okay, now scheduled for execution.

1141
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,770
One Imperial City sewers...

1142
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,530
Oh, nice!

1143
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,930
I'm still not over it.

1144
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,790
You fail to disappoint...

1145
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,950
Why would you say...

1146
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,370
It's like...

1147
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,930
It sounds like a double negative.

1148
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,970
Or it is a double...

1149
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:00,110
Wait.

1150
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,690
It sounds...

1151
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,810
It sounds like I'm failing and disappointing you.

1152
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,710
It's confusing.

1153
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,130
Alright, where are we going?

1154
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,100
Imperial Prison Sewer.

1155
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:17,760
Oh, that's right!

1156
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,060
That's where I came out of.

1157
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,620
You cannot fast travel...

1158
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,600
Oh, from this location.

1159
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,040
Okay.

1160
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,720
Mean token first.

1161
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:31,880
Yeah.

1162
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,580
He just should have...

1163
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,500
Maybe thought of a better way to say it.

1164
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,920
Okay, so we can't kill the guards.

1165
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,840
But are there rat people...

1166
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,040
In the sewers again?

1167
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,100
And can I kill those?

1168
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,540
You are a failure at disappointing us.

1169
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,740
I don't fail at nothing.

1170
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,340
I'll disappoint you.

1171
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,300
Yeah, there were rat people in the sewers.

1172
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,920
He's trying to distract from the wig.

1173
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,360
Bizarre word humor.

1174
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,240
Like, we all know...

1175
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,720
What are those?

1176
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,860
What are those crawling around?

1177
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,020
Did you guys see that?

1178
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,320
Okay, there's an imp over there.

1179
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,520
What was that thing crawling?

1180
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,740
Oh, those are the crabs?

1181
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,400
They looked huge.

1182
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,460
Let's, um...

1183
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,440
Put our...

1184
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,060
Which one was it?

1185
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,000
What...

1186
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,080
Which one did I use?

1187
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,660
The steel bow?

1188
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:55,700
Maybe...

1189
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,540
Or the iron bow?

1190
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,600
They both have the same damage.

1191
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,260
I guess either one is fine.

1192
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,080
Wait, but iron it...

1193
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,900
A steel arrow...

1194
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,420
Oh, I guess it's fine.

1195
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,080
Either is fine.

1196
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:09,400
Yeah.

1197
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,780
I forgot to ask...

1198
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,100
Oh my gosh.

1199
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,680
It's so late to ask this.

1200
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,920
But is the volume okay?

1201
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,440
Are the graphics looking alright?

1202
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,560
Feel free to speak up.

1203
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:24,860
E.T.

1204
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,500
looking at it.

1205
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,240
Yeah, our name is E.T.

1206
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,700
now.

1207
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,060
Everything good?

1208
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,590
Oh, what is that?

1209
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,250
Green stained cup.

1210
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:42,890
Okay, let's go in.

1211
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,230
Oh, see, there's rats in there.

1212
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,370
And let me know too.

1213
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,810
Oh, I have entered the sewers beneath the Imperial Prison.

1214
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,030
Now I must proceed through the sewers into the prison itself and kill Val and Dread.

1215
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,150
This is kind of a long trek back, no?

1216
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,190
This is a long quest.

1217
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,670
I better get a lot of money for this.

1218
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:08,790
But, um...

1219
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,170
What was I going to say?

1220
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:18,940
I don't remember.

1221
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,540
Where's the other rat at?

1222
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,440
Oh, there he is.

1223
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,160
It's like right behind him.

1224
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,340
Can I get him?

1225
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,900
Yes, I can.

1226
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:31,900
Ha ha ha.

1227
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,140
Will there be guards and stuff patrolling now?

1228
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,260
I wonder.

1229
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,440
Oh.

1230
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,180
Uh.

1231
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,560
Oh.

1232
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,540
Ha ha ha.

1233
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,520
The gate is sealed.

1234
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,100
We'll activate it.

1235
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,160
We have...

1236
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,000
...reached an impasse.

1237
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,240
Nitro, thank you so much!

1238
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,360
Fine iron is as powerful as steel, but lighter.

1239
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,660
Fine steel is as powerful as silver, but lighter.

1240
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,220
Oh, wait!

1241
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,180
I don't know the way, you guys!

1242
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,760
I don't know at all!

1243
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:34,830
What is that?

1244
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:37,990
A spider?

1245
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,830
What is that thing?

1246
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:51,330
Mr. Krabs?

1247
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,190
Oh, it is a crab!

1248
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,330
Mud crab.

1249
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,170
These things are...

1250
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,470
Why are you holding gold?

1251
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,530
Crab meat sounds delicious.

1252
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,650
Luckily, Itina doesn't need to eat.

1253
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,990
I hear something.

1254
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,590
I don't know the way at all, you guys.

1255
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,130
What is that sound?

1256
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,930
Oh!

1257
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,710
Something's in the water.

1258
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:30,470
Oh!

1259
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:32,930
There's...

1260
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,370
Oh, the red arrow.

1261
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,250
Oh my gosh, you're right!

1262
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,210
I didn't even notice it.

1263
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,810
Those are some crazy fish!

1264
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,490
Oh, those are the slaughter fish!

1265
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:42,610
Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:46,270
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

1267
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,060
I hear something walking.

1268
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,300
I wanna be sneaky, though.

1269
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,280
Okay, I don't think there's any...

1270
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:14,680
Oh!

1271
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:17,860
Arrow ready?

1272
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,180
Is it small?

1273
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:19,680
Is it big?

1274
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,920
What could it be?

1275
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,870
I don't hear it no more.

1276
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,270
Heh heh heh.

1277
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,220
Got his butt.

1278
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,680
Lock pick!

1279
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,410
We'll take potions.

1280
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,530
I don't need torch.

1281
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,130
No!

1282
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:00,030
Not...

1283
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:00,610
Not...

1284
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,410
Not lick!

1285
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:02,630
Lock!

1286
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:03,650
Lock!

1287
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:03,950
Lock!

1288
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:09,010
I should do, like, some vocal exercises before I play this game.

1289
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,170
We're like, lock!

1290
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:10,630
Pick!

1291
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,290
Lock!

1292
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:11,790
Pick!

1293
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:13,850
Lock!

1294
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:14,670
Lock!

1295
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:15,450
Lock!

1296
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:15,650
Lock!

1297
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:15,970
Lock!

1298
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:16,450
Pick!

1299
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,850
I don't know why I say lick-pock.

1300
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,190
I don't know.

1301
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,070
My brain works in mysterious ways, everybody.

1302
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,350
Did I get my arrows?

1303
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,410
I think so, yeah.

1304
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,890
So we go this way.

1305
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,890
Just making sure.

1306
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:39,430
There's got...

1307
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,230
Oh, there's a mudcrub.

1308
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:43,730
I feel like there's gotta be other stuff in here.

1309
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,530
Even chests.

1310
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:46,810
Nothing.

1311
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,560
Malilu-lay.

1312
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,260
Lock pick.

1313
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:00,010
Who?

1314
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:00,550
Where?

1315
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,170
Oh, my God.

1316
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:03,010
Are you kidding me?

1317
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,570
Oh, here he comes.

1318
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,570
Sneak!

1319
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,570
I did?

1320
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:10,590
What?

1321
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,490
Freud would suggest you secretly want to lick pockets.

1322
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:17,370
I don't!

1323
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:17,950
I don't!

1324
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:18,910
I never have!

1325
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,620
Oh, do I need to go down here?

1326
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,460
Wait.

1327
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,540
Shows like this direction.

1328
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,620
I guess down there.

1329
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,640
Yeah, I think I do.

1330
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,420
Likely story.

1331
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,020
Sometimes, you know, when you pick up pennies.

1332
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,620
And they...

1333
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,620
And then you're...

1334
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,100
And that...

1335
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,340
And then you...

1336
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,400
And then your hand smells brassy.

1337
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,460
That happens sometimes with my jewelry.

1338
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,440
I get like really cheap jewelry.

1339
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,820
That's how I imagined.

1340
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,000
It probably would taste like...

1341
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,060
Licking blood or something.

1342
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,060
Oh, oh, gosh.

1343
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,300
The music scared me for a second.

1344
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,400
Trying to see if I see anything.

1345
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,640
I don't think I do.

1346
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,380
Don't lick coins.

1347
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,300
I don't!

1348
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,820
I hear the rats, but I don't see them.

1349
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,340
That's fine.

1350
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,060
She's cool.

1351
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,300
Oh!

1352
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,310
Don't bother me, crab.

1353
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,360
I'm mostly afraid of guards spotting me.

1354
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm gonna save real quick.

1355
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,240
So that...

1356
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,820
Just in case we do get spotted.

1357
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,020
What the...

1358
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,560
What am I hearing?

1359
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,720
What am I hearing?

1360
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,680
Mysterious?

1361
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,120
So sneaky.

1362
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,180
We are stealth.

1363
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,540
We are so sneaky.

1364
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,040
What am I hearing?

1365
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,660
Oh,

1366
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,160
maybe it's that guy.

1367
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,700
So many crabs.

1368
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,500
Where were all you guys before?

1369
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,720
Where were all these crabs when I was traversing the first time?

1370
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,540
Sewer sounds.

1371
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,000
Maybe that's it.

1372
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:58,560
Okay.

1373
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,080
Onwards?

1374
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,900
At the crab rave.

1375
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,180
I don't remember this part at all.

1376
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,610
One time damage.

1377
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,390
They're not as aggressive as I thought they'd be.

1378
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:25,150
Sometimes.

1379
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,750
I feel like sometimes they really just come at you, you know?

1380
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,390
Oh, well...

1381
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,370
I spoke...

1382
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,230
Way too soon.

1383
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,320
Yep, exactly as I said.

1384
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,020
Yep, just like that.

1385
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:44,120
What?

1386
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,560
They look cute?

1387
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,120
To me, they look delicious.

1388
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,060
Wait, does this open up?

1389
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,640
The gate is open remotely.

1390
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,930
But also, I need to go that way.

1391
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,010
Like this direction.

1392
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,290
Open remotely.

1393
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,270
You guys see it?

1394
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,410
Oh!

1395
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,910
I see it!

1396
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,280
We have gained access!

1397
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,920
Yes!

1398
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,650
No elp.

1399
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,030
I don't need your elp.

1400
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,770
Do these go anywhere?

1401
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:58,010
No.

1402
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,410
What's to be in here?

1403
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,730
29 gold!

1404
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:04,730
I'll take it.

1405
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:07,350
Okay.

1406
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,450
Very nice.

1407
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,510
I'm as lost as you, boss.

1408
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,530
We'll figure it out.

1409
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,240
Easy peasy.

1410
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,660
We're safe scumming a little bit.

1411
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,580
It's okay.

1412
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,880
Nothing here?

1413
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,760
Nothing here.

1414
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,860
Door to sewers.

1415
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,800
Oh!

1416
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,460
Whoa!

1417
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,910
Why are they so dumb?

1418
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,250
Wait!

1419
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,590
Was this the area?

1420
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:21,050
No.

1421
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:22,530
I don't...

1422
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:22,730
Where?

1423
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,210
I don't remember these areas at all.

1424
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:30,950
Ah!

1425
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:34,550
And...

1426
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,690
Go!

1427
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:37,790
We got him.

1428
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:39,810
We'll get this guy too.

1429
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:40,550
This guys.

1430
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:42,890
And...

1431
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:43,010
Shoot!

1432
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:50,700
Oh!

1433
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,560
No, he's dead.

1434
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,080
I'll take my arrow back.

1435
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,400
Thank you very much.

1436
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,820
And my other arrow back.

1437
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,700
Thank you very much.

1438
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,860
I'm a master fisher.

1439
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,700
The slaughter fish has become the slaughtered.

1440
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,520
Easy as shootin' fish.

1441
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:23,860
Curious that the part of the game she locked into the most was unlocking things.

1442
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:25,740
Yeah.

1443
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,640
I'm afraid of people down here.

1444
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,980
I'm afraid of the humans.

1445
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,340
I don't care about all the fish and the rats and the crabs.

1446
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,280
Is that a crab?

1447
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,220
No, that's not a crab.

1448
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,660
I'm afraid of some guard being like...

1449
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,520
What are you doing down here?

1450
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,440
Who?

1451
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:00,600
Crab.

1452
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,330
Oh, I have to go that way.

1453
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,210
Hold on, I'm exploring a little bit first.

1454
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:15,830
Cheese wheel.

1455
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,890
The rats must be...

1456
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,230
That's why they're partying.

1457
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:21,930
Nice.

1458
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,510
Wait, there's another thing we can go through.

1459
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:27,950
Gate.

1460
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,710
Cheese to meet you.

1461
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:39,590
Stop.

1462
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:41,070
You violated the sewer.

1463
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,830
Is it a crime to be...

1464
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:45,070
Going around in a sewer anyway?

1465
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,510
I don't think so.

1466
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,530
Well, my sneak has increased.

1467
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:50,310
Let's go.

1468
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,380
That's always a good thing.

1469
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,180
Become sneakier.

1470
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,680
Okay, now where am I going?

1471
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:06,800
I've...

1472
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,940
I've strayed from the path a little bit.

1473
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,040
The gate is sealed.

1474
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,950
I don't know.

1475
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,330
What was the point?

1476
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,080
Huh.

1477
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,700
Go to the...

1478
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:50,840
Oh.

1479
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,440
That crab scared me.

1480
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:53,720
Lucky.

1481
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,820
To the right.

1482
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,480
To the right.

1483
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,340
To the right, right, right, right, right.

1484
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:58,560
Look at that gate.

1485
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,120
Where's the other one?

1486
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,940
I know there's two of you in here.

1487
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,560
Oh.

1488
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,820
God, they're so chunky.

1489
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,160
They look like my cat.

1490
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,120
The point was the 29 gold we made along the way.

1491
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,340
We'll be making gold.

1492
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,820
Once we...

1493
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,920
Kill the guy.

1494
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,700
Eye on the prize, everybody.

1495
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,420
We're gonna kill that guy.

1496
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,420
Who's in jail.

1497
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,710
And then...

1498
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:36,150
Oh.

1499
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,030
I think we found the exit.

1500
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,250
Wait, we didn't go through the...

1501
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,250
Why is there...

1502
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,650
We didn't go through...

1503
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,630
The caves.

1504
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:52,810
This is way less...

1505
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,150
Of a trek than I remember.

1506
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:57,790
Ha ha ha ha.

1507
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,540
Of course I'm proud to do my duty.

1508
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,300
But it's a waste of time.

1509
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,580
What are we guarding?

1510
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,140
Cold stone and shadow.

1511
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,080
That's it.

1512
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,320
I'm not disagreeing with you, believe me.

1513
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,500
Those assassins got what they wanted.

1514
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,880
The emperor is dead.

1515
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,040
They got no reason to come back.

1516
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,780
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1517
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,500
But will the captain listen?

1518
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,140
No.

1519
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,600
We must have a presence.

1520
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,320
The prison must remain secure.

1521
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,880
Yeah, what a laugh, huh?

1522
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:31,920
Cold stone.

1523
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:32,760
I love cold stone.

1524
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,020
Just who are we keeping secure?

1525
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:34,640
Dreath?

1526
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,940
Since that other one got away, he's the only one rotting down here.

1527
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:42,200
Yeah, well, I guess you can't blame Captain Montrose too much.

1528
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,000
That's the guy we have to kill.

1529
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,060
This is his big career move, after all.

1530
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,860
Got to impress that lot upstairs.

1531
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,960
Yeah, true enough.

1532
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:51,940
Oh, well.

1533
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,380
I best be getting back...

1534
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,000
Okay, I'm just trying to...

1535
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,440
Don't forget.

1536
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,640
We're meeting for drinks later at the bloated float.

1537
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,300
Ew.

1538
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,580
Oh, I'll be there.

1539
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,180
How could I miss a chance to see you cower before that big orc bouncer?

1540
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,400
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1541
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,260
I ain't afraid of no one.

1542
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,440
Courage is my middle name.

1543
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,180
I...

1544
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:09,960
Oh, never mind.

1545
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,700
Bloated float is a terrible name.

1546
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,180
Okay, so he leaves.

1547
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:23,850
And is this guy, like, facing away?

1548
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:24,390
I did...

1549
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,970
I did save right before we came up here.

1550
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,450
So we can experiment a little bit.

1551
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,190
Where was he...

1552
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,750
Where was the person he was talking to?

1553
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,130
That's what I wonder.

1554
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,190
We'll get an extra bonus if we don't kill any guards, but...

1555
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,450
You know, if we have to, we have to.

1556
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,660
Oh, golly.

1557
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,620
Um...

1558
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,180
Is there a way to get up?

1559
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:04,520
No.

1560
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:08,900
Uh-oh.

1561
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:18,740
I run?

1562
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,240
I'm running?

1563
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,200
Which way?

1564
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,240
Where do I go?

1565
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,380
Where do I go?

1566
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:28,320
Where do I go?

1567
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,280
Where do I go?

1568
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,540
This way?

1569
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,300
This way?

1570
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:32,960
A little dead end?

1571
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:33,820
Oh.

1572
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:34,780
Oh.

1573
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:40,610
Where'd the arrow go?

1574
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:41,490
Arrow's gone.

1575
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,190
Oh, here it is.

1576
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:42,990
Run.

1577
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:48,460
Where'd the arrow go?

1578
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:49,540
Arrow?

1579
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:50,780
Arrow?

1580
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,360
Wait, this is where I came from.

1581
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,120
The game bamboozled me.

1582
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:54,700
Ouch.

1583
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,520
Wait.

1584
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,640
Which way do I go?

1585
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,500
The game bamboozled me.

1586
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,580
This way.

1587
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:15,760
Nope.

1588
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:16,580
Where?

1589
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,560
Can they see me?

1590
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,400
Oh.

1591
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,060
Use it again.

1592
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,600
Ouch.

1593
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,480
Yeah, I'm...

1594
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:27,660
Oh.

1595
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,860
That guy likes me.

1596
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,560
I'm gonna die.

1597
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,380
I'm gonna die.

1598
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,840
I'm just trying to figure out where to go.

1599
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,560
Where do I go?

1600
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:35,940
Oh my god.

1601
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,220
How are you guys so fast?

1602
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:39,300
Okay, so there's four.

1603
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,840
Guys, I'm so lost.

1604
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,540
It tells me to go...

1605
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,160
I went the wrong way.

1606
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,310
My help if you...

1607
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,970
Open your map.

1608
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,350
I'm getting chased for my life.

1609
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,030
I don't have...

1610
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:14,830
Oh my god, they're here.

1611
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:15,410
Oh.

1612
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:17,010
Bye-bye.

1613
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,050
Oh my god.

1614
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,590
Okay.

1615
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:24,010
I fought Minecraft more fearsome than you.

1616
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:27,350
Okay, here.

1617
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:28,510
Oh.

1618
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,370
Leave me alone.

1619
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,170
And then...

1620
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:41,830
Okay, fine.

1621
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:42,550
I'll open my map.

1622
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,410
What the hell?

1623
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,830
This doesn't help at all.

1624
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:50,830
How am I supposed to read this?

1625
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,060
What?

1626
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,700
I'm not my help if you open your map, Mito.

1627
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,240
Yeah.

1628
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,540
Absolute gibberish.

1629
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,020
Okay, hold on.

1630
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,140
Ugh.

1631
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,420
Like, how am I supposed to get up here?

1632
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,140
Apparently, I was here.

1633
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,600
And then I...

1634
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,380
I messed it up.

1635
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,960
How did I mess it up?

1636
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:24,920
Typical Mito.

1637
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,500
Okay, where am I?

1638
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,780
Okay, maybe...

1639
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:36,760
Right here.

1640
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:37,940
Ah, ah, ah.

1641
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1642
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:42,560
Yeah.

1643
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,620
We're doing it?

1644
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,800
Wait, I went the wrong way.

1645
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,020
Don't come after me.

1646
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:08,360
Oh.

1647
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:12,070
I'm lost.

1648
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:12,890
This is so mean.

1649
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,050
Dead end!

1650
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,630
Oh my god, I'm at one HP in a dream.

1651
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,810
Where'd the arrow go?

1652
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:22,810
Oh.

1653
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,850
Oh.

1654
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:24,870
Eh?

1655
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:27,550
Eh?

1656
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,550
Use a potion?

1657
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:33,390
So true.

1658
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:34,750
Inventory.

1659
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,490
Potion of healing.

1660
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,230
Nice.

1661
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,670
In fact, I'll just do two.

1662
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:47,610
Okay.

1663
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:50,610
Back to the map.

1664
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,570
I need to turn a rat...

1665
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,010
Wait, I need to come back from where I came.

1666
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,730
Uh-oh.

1667
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,370
But it looks like a dead end.

1668
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,370
There must have...

1669
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,930
Oh, it must have been the other side.

1670
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,030
Okay.

1671
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,530
I'll have to loop them maybe.

1672
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,530
If I could even do that.

1673
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,110
Oh, I can.

1674
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:15,650
Let's go.

1675
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,460
Let's...

1676
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,200
Oh, shoot.

1677
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:23,980
Oh.

1678
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,380
Oh, wait, wait.

1679
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,320
Am I at the right place?

1680
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,360
Yes.

1681
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:30,200
Um...

1682
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,530
Is this an exit?

1683
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,250
The bastion.

1684
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:39,390
But they're gonna be chasing me forever, aren't they?

1685
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,580
They're gonna be chasing me forever out of here.

1686
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,320
I think I gotta reload.

1687
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,420
But now I know...

1688
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:53,800
Ish.

1689
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:55,480
Where'd it go?

1690
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,010
But how do I get around this guy?

1691
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:16,190
Oh, geez.

1692
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,670
Oh.

1693
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,680
Oh.

1694
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,400
Why does your character look like a female ET?

1695
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,060
Her name is E-Tina.

1696
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,140
Of course I'm proud to do my duty.

1697
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:42,400
Important spell effect to help with sneaking is detect life so you can see people through walls and not accidentally turn a corner into guards.

1698
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:42,880
Oh.

1699
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:44,880
But it's a waste of time.

1700
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,140
What are we guarding?

1701
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,100
I'm not disagreeing.

1702
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,480
I'm not disagreeing.

1703
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:49,520
I'm not disagreeing.

1704
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,780
Oh, there is a guy here.

1705
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:51,720
Um.

1706
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:58,960
I see.

1707
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,100
I'm not disagreeing with you.

1708
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:00,800
Believe me.

1709
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,300
Those assassins got what they wanted.

1710
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,800
I don't think my sneak is high enough.

1711
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,500
They got no reason to come back.

1712
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,260
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1713
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,960
But will the captain listen?

1714
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,680
No.

1715
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,060
We must have a presence.

1716
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,760
The prison must remain secure.

1717
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,380
Yeah, what a laugh, huh?

1718
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,460
Just who are we keeping secure?

1719
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:22,440
Do detect life.

1720
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,000
Since that- I don't even know if I know that.

1721
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,140
Let's see.

1722
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:27,300
Um.

1723
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,840
I don't even know if I know that.

1724
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
I don't know how to do magic in this game.

1725
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:35,780
Yeah.

1726
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,240
I guess you can't blame Captain Montrose too much.

1727
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,780
This is his big career move after all.

1728
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,480
Got to impress that lot upstairs.

1729
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,660
Yeah, true enough.

1730
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,320
Oh well, I best be getting back to my watch.

1731
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,400
Potion or Spell of Invisibility.

1732
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,300
I definitely don't think I have that.

1733
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:55,280
Oh, I'll be there.

1734
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:59,540
How could I miss a chance to see you cower before that big- Chameleon?

1735
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,740
Oh, I do have that!

1736
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,260
How long- Oh, it only lasts 30 seconds though.

1737
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,940
It doesn't last long.

1738
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,990
I'm trying to think.

1739
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,390
Shadow shape, what's that?

1740
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,550
Oh!

1741
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:41,850
Invisibility on self!

1742
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:43,630
For 30 seconds.

1743
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,970
I think this one was only 25% too.

1744
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,650
This one seems full.

1745
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:52,410
I didn't even know I had invisibility.

1746
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,070
Wilbur said, check if you have it.

1747
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:55,670
And I said no.

1748
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:56,990
I was a liar.

1749
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,010
Here.

1750
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:01,810
Um...

1751
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,170
It runs out when you interact with doors.

1752
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,550
So if I were to interact...

1753
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,550
And kill the...

1754
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:09,830
Guy?

1755
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,490
Like if I open up his cell?

1756
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:15,870
I think it would be best to use it on the way out then, no?

1757
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:18,710
Open it up.

1758
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,170
Would they still see me if I use it?

1759
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,450
And I try to...

1760
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:23,290
Like they see me.

1761
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:24,770
I kill the guy.

1762
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:25,610
I use it.

1763
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,030
And I...

1764
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,570
Leave.

1765
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,040
You can just run on the way out.

1766
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,080
But they'll chase me forever!

1767
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:34,560
No!

1768
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:45,350
You don't need it on the way out?

1769
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,180
Only if they see you on the way in.

1770
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,280
Oh, okay.

1771
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,500
What sucks is...

1772
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,980
My map is not filled out...

1773
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:58,460
Anymore.

1774
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,440
Because I had to restart.

1775
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:07,240
Okay.

1776
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,800
I think it was like...

1777
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,500
Up and around.

1778
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,540
Was this...

1779
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,180
This was the first door.

1780
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,420
And then it led to the second door.

1781
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:21,980
Yes, yeah.

1782
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:22,780
I think I remember.

1783
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:25,600
Uh...

1784
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:26,700
Uh...

1785
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:27,640
Okay, let's just...

1786
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,960
We have to...

1787
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,340
Wait it out anyway.

1788
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:30,920
I think.

1789
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,100
Unless...

1790
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,740
Do you think I could get there in 30 seconds?

1791
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,900
That's a pretty long time.

1792
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,260
You know what?

1793
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,160
Let's just try it.

1794
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,320
Let's see how long it takes for us to get there.

1795
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,060
Cuz...

1796
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,180
I could try.

1797
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,540
I could try.

1798
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:51,760
30 seconds is...

1799
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,200
If I know where to go...

1800
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:54,720
Oh wait!

1801
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,200
The door!

1802
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:55,900
That's right!

1803
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,360
That's right!

1804
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,300
If I interact...

1805
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,080
With any door?

1806
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:00,500
Really?

1807
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:03,300
Oh...

1808
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,940
Get past the first door first.

1809
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,260
Okay.

1810
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:06,800
Yeah...

1811
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,220
That's right...

1812
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,000
Interact with anything.

1813
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:14,300
Oh...

1814
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:14,540
Okay.

1815
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:15,340
How do I...

1816
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,240
Also, how do I cast it?

1817
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,040
So if I...

1818
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,300
Have it equipped now...

1819
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,380
If I press C...

1820
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,020
Will it work?

1821
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,060
Yes?

1822
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:27,440
Okay.

1823
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:28,420
Thank you!

1824
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:29,840
Okay.

1825
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,180
Oh!

1826
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:32,940
They're done.

1827
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,530
I'm afraid of getting past this guy.

1828
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:41,210
I don't know where the other guy goes.

1829
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,770
Oh, he must go down like a further...

1830
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,450
Do I need to go that way?

1831
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:51,810
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1832
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:53,570
Huh.

1833
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,630
Curious.

1834
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:57,570
Curious.

1835
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,230
How do I get around this guy?

1836
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Maybe he turns around and goes...

1837
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,240
Somewhere else.

1838
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,920
Actually, is he down this way?

1839
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:23,680
Okay.

1840
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,180
First room done.

1841
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,270
Now I don't know where the guys are gonna be at though.

1842
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:36,910
Oh...

1843
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:37,770
Ha ha ha ha!

1844
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,170
Let's save.

1845
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,630
Since we got through the first room.

1846
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,080
I'm abusing the camera.

1847
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,480
Metal Gear, Metal Gear, Metal Gear, Metal Gear.

1848
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,400
Is that a chest?

1849
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,600
I think anyone will hear.

1850
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:25,370
I don't see anybody.

1851
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,350
But I imagine it...

1852
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:28,950
Okay, hold on.

1853
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:31,150
This one...

1854
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:31,910
This one was tricky.

1855
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,130
Because I remember...

1856
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,450
This is the one where I think I go down through here...

1857
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:40,590
And then there's the two doors.

1858
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,870
If I remember correctly.

1859
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:47,990
Stick to edges and dark areas.

1860
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:48,370
Okay.

1861
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:50,730
Well then this...

1862
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:51,810
This way would be better.

1863
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:56,270
I save, so if...

1864
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,670
We get caught, it's...

1865
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,750
Not the end of the world.

1866
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,800
I'm just a little baby.

1867
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,560
I'm scared.

1868
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:08,420
Was it here?

1869
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:09,440
No.

1870
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,580
Where does this go?

1871
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:12,920
Needs a key.

1872
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:36,250
I almost want to save, but I'm too scared to.

1873
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:40,050
Plus what if it saves me in a pretty bad spot, you know?

1874
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:01,930
Ah, sorry.

1875
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:03,110
Um...

1876
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,390
Map.

1877
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,030
That's what I was doing.

1878
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:06,470
Uh...

1879
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,710
Then we go up here and then go around.

1880
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:12,030
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1881
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:14,030
Could you do a not quick save?

1882
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:16,890
Um...

1883
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:17,670
I guess.

1884
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:38,640
Oh yeah, I go...

1885
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,320
Oh, it's different than what I remember.

1886
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,910
This is the one...

1887
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:03,130
Eh?

1888
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,250
I can't remember.

1889
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:06,010
Now I'm topsy-turvy.

1890
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,230
Oh, this is where I looped them.

1891
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:13,810
So I, uh...

1892
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,790
I have a feeling someone's gonna come through here.

1893
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,130
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there.

1894
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:22,650
Okay, okay.

1895
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,590
This is where I remember.

1896
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:25,410
The map looks so...

1897
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:27,350
Wonky that it's hard for...

1898
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,550
Like, this is the one where I go around.

1899
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:29,110
Yes, yes, yes.

1900
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:32,630
It looks so wonky that I can't even...

1901
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,430
Process.

1902
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,270
I feel like someone's gonna walk through here, so I'm just gonna hide here.

1903
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:53,610
Maybe not!

1904
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,460
Okay.

1905
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:28,360
Ugh...

1906
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,520
I'm gonna save.

1907
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:38,850
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1908
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:40,630
Yeah, well...

1909
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,510
What's it been?

1910
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:42,470
Seven?

1911
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:43,730
Eight years?

1912
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:46,710
We've had a good long run, you and me.

1913
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,550
I always knew it would end someday.

1914
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:50,830
Eleven!

1915
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,590
Eleven years in this rat-infested hole!

1916
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:56,510
But I'm getting out!

1917
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:58,110
Can I...

1918
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:59,610
I guess I can leave through here.

1919
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,910
I...

1920
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:03,110
I assume that is the...

1921
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:05,410
That's the goal.

1922
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:06,610
Is to leave through...

1923
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,610
That...

1924
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,930
Eleven!

1925
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,210
Oh yeah?

1926
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:14,890
Oh yeah?

1927
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:16,790
And where will you go, huh?

1928
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:18,690
What will you do?

1929
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:20,850
You can't survive out there.

1930
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:21,290
Did I save?

1931
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:23,110
You're an animal.

1932
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,610
You belong in that cage.

1933
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:27,430
I'm also watching out for these.

1934
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,850
Don't worry.

1935
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:32,650
Right.

1936
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:33,330
I did?

1937
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:33,610
Okay.

1938
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:36,270
Save again.

1939
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,150
Oh, and you'll become a king.

1940
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:39,110
Save again.

1941
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,550
I'm scared.

1942
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,710
Oh yeah!

1943
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:46,290
Wait, this is my cell!

1944
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:50,130
You'll see an imperial dog when I get out of here.

1945
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,530
This is my cell!

1946
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:52,730
And this is the guy that...

1947
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:55,090
Wait, we're killing the guy that was rude to me at the beginning.

1948
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:58,150
All right, all right.

1949
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:02,230
I'm tempted to let you out right now if you'll just shut up.

1950
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,980
I think I can get him through here.

1951
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:31,800
Hey.

1952
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,120
Yeah.

1953
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:34,520
Yeah.

1954
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:35,340
You're the one.

1955
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,540
That day the emperor was killed.

1956
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,120
Yeah, yeah.

1957
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,640
They went through your cell.

1958
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,300
You lucky strumpet.

1959
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,440
But you came back?

1960
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:44,740
Come on.

1961
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,020
You've got to help me.

1962
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,340
Let old Valen out of this cell.

1963
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:49,880
You've got your freedom.

1964
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,040
Now give me mine.

1965
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,460
What do you say, huh?

1966
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,880
Come on, friend.

1967
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:54,860
Friend?

1968
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,420
The night mother says goodbye.

1969
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:03,260
You're going to die in here.

1970
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:04,460
Say nothing.

1971
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,720
Wow, we're so stoic and cool.

1972
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,400
The night mother says goodbye.

1973
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:11,440
What if I...

1974
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,900
But then maybe he'll scream and alert the guards.

1975
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:22,420
Yeah, we'll give you your freedom from your mortal coil.

1976
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,180
Um...

1977
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,180
We're going to say nothing.

1978
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:28,960
We're going to be cool.

1979
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,720
Now how do I kill you?

1980
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,420
Um...

1981
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,380
Do I have to open his cell?

1982
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:53,090
Rip Bozo.

1983
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:53,650
Yep.

1984
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:56,550
How do I talk to him?

1985
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:56,870
Wait.

1986
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,990
I can't...

1987
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,690
I can find a key nearby.

1988
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:02,810
Oh, thank you.

1989
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:04,970
And...

1990
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,210
Yeah, maybe not the bow and arrow.

1991
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,090
Let's change to...

1992
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:11,650
The Sufferthorn.

1993
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:12,890
And...

1994
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:15,090
I will also do...

1995
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,540
None of these really...

1996
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,320
Oh, drain health!

1997
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:27,760
Sufferthorn.

1998
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:27,920
Sufferthorn.

1999
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:31,780
I don't think you can shoot through the bars.

2000
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,100
I don't think so.

2001
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:34,060
Okay.

2002
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:38,920
You look like E.T.

2003
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,320
Put some respect on her name.

2004
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,220
Her name is E.T.

2005
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:41,560
now.

2006
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,140
Oh, here we go.

2007
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:43,800
Wait.

2008
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:44,860
Oh.

2009
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:55,840
Here we go.

2010
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,480
Oh.

2011
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:11,800
Valendreth is dead.

2012
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,400
And no guards have been killed.

2013
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,760
I must return to the sanctuary and speak to...

2014
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,060
Vincent Valtieri to receive my reward as well as a bonus.

2015
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,960
You got anything on you?

2016
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,000
No.

2017
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:28,640
Okay.

2018
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,000
Yippee!

2019
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,580
Oh, and peace.

2020
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,560
Oh, wow.

2021
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,360
It's so peaceful.

2022
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,340
Hello.

2023
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:46,840
Stop!

2024
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,720
You violated the law.

2025
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,840
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.

2026
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,260
What do you mean?

2027
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:55,040
Stolen goods now forfeit.

2028
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,170
What do you mean?

2029
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,820
What did I do?

2030
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,580
It's 40 gold.

2031
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,160
Okay.

2032
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,320
I'll pay it.

2033
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,520
That's too bad.

2034
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,340
I was hoping it would resist arrest.

2035
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,000
How do you guys know what the price is?

2036
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:25,260
Okay.

2037
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,700
Here's the procedure.

2038
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,300
We go to the castle.

2039
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,960
First, we search you.

2040
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,300
Confiscate any stolen goods.

2041
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,120
Then you pay your fine.

2042
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:34,920
I'll reload.

2043
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,980
Oh, it says in the top left.

2044
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:37,480
Oh, I...

2045
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:44,590
I thought we were in the clear.

2046
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,240
Okay.

2047
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,040
I'm gonna reload.

2048
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:49,940
I'm gonna reload.

2049
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:58,030
And that guy just walks away, so it's fine.

2050
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,150
I was like, hello.

2051
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:03,090
Hello, Mr. Guard.

2052
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,370
All right, all right.

2053
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:08,270
I'm tempted to let you out right now if you'll just shut up.

2054
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:19,850
Well, they, like, just didn't, you know, do anything before, so... I thought it was... I thought it was fun!

2055
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:26,010
Like, I walked out, and they were like, ah, she's supposed to be here.

2056
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:27,650
You know?

2057
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,450
Oh, yeah.

2058
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:32,610
Wait, I know you.

2059
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:33,950
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2060
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,790
The Night Mother says goodbye.

2061
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:36,910
The Night Mother?

2062
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,970
No, no!

2063
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:38,430
Oh.

2064
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:40,230
Wait, are they coming?

2065
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,640
No one's coming to help you.

2066
01:43:59,250 --> 01:43:59,730
Okay.

2067
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:03,330
Now I leave, and I don't talk to anybody.

2068
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,830
What is it, citizen?

2069
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21,510
Yes, I'm a citizen!

2070
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,700
Let's fast travel.

2071
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:31,980
Home.

2072
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,680
The guard asked for dreads...

2073
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,000
For dreads what?

2074
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,220
Assassination?

2075
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,620
They just didn't want to deal with the guy anymore.

2076
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:45,660
Clearly.

2077
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:48,400
Woohoo!

2078
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,120
How are you?

2079
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,220
Oh, my God.

2080
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,660
Oh, I thought you were naked for a second, mister.

2081
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:57,500
Hello.

2082
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:00,800
They'll never...

2083
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,460
They'll never know.

2084
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,320
They'll never know!

2085
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:03,680
Oh.

2086
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:12,460
I'm actually more surprised that that jail only had three...

2087
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:14,080
Oh, well, technically four...

2088
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,200
Jail cells.

2089
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,800
That seems very small, no?

2090
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:25,380
You showed off your stealth gaming skills.

2091
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,220
Bravo, Minky.

2092
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:27,320
Thank you.

2093
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,020
Thank you, thank you.

2094
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,240
Where is he?

2095
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:35,720
Hello.

2096
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,780
I won't bother your reading.

2097
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:44,040
Well, they get mad now because I have the Imperial Jail Key.

2098
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,840
Is that why they were mad at me?

2099
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:48,700
Oh, wake up.

2100
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:49,440
Give me my money.

2101
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:58,740
So, you infiltrated the Imperial Prison, eliminated Vaylin Dress, and killed not one guard.

2102
01:45:58,860 --> 01:45:59,500
Hallway, oh.

2103
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,100
Most excellent.

2104
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,520
In addition to your standard reward, I present to you this bonus.

2105
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,600
Behold, the scales of pitiless justice.

2106
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:09,760
The scales of...

2107
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:14,540
While carried, the scales will magically enhance your strength, intelligence, and agility.

2108
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:17,060
But diminish your personality.

2109
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,280
A powerful tool, indeed.

2110
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:20,620
Oh.

2111
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,360
The greatest soldier in the world!

2112
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:24,380
Thank you, guys.

2113
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,100
Thank you.

2114
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,720
So, how much did I make from that?

2115
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:36,730
Like, 200 gold?

2116
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:41,490
100 gold.

2117
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:43,050
That's it.

2118
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:48,210
Minus two, Riz.

2119
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:48,830
What is it?

2120
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:49,190
Let's see.

2121
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:50,390
What's this thing that we got?

2122
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:53,390
What is it called?

2123
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:59,210
Oh, the scales of pitiless justice.

2124
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:18,310
I have to wear it?

2125
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:22,650
I don't even need to use this shadow shape.

2126
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,510
I'm too good, baby.

2127
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,550
Oh, it's a pas...

2128
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,570
Oh, you just carried it.

2129
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:28,290
Okay, cool.

2130
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,850
Let's put our bow back on.

2131
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:32,590
I have to repair this soon.

2132
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:35,750
Yeah.

2133
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:37,890
It's pasive.

2134
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:39,470
So, I...

2135
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:40,810
Have a...

2136
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,510
A poopy personality.

2137
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:44,950
People want to be my friend.

2138
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:52,150
Not only did you eliminate the target, but as six Imperial Legion escorts as well.

2139
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:54,250
Most impressive.

2140
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:56,090
So you heard.

2141
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,690
Yes, yes, it was quite the debacle.

2142
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:00,950
The head just wouldn't sever.

2143
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,630
Cut.

2144
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:02,350
Saw.

2145
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:03,090
Hack.

2146
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:04,630
I sit this.

2147
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:06,990
I swear her tendons were made of steel.

2148
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:11,530
Yes, well, if there's one thing you know how to do, it's...

2149
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,430
Get yourself out of an unwinnable situation.

2150
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,070
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2151
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:17,350
Ah.

2152
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:19,630
Well, I suppose I should get going.

2153
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:21,290
So many contracts.

2154
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:22,550
So little time.

2155
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,450
Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.

2156
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:30,330
Hey, Minky.

2157
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:33,050
I can't wait to see you do silly stuff on off-kai this weekend.

2158
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:33,810
Today's my birthday.

2159
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:34,670
Can I get a Metal Gear?

2160
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:35,210
Happy birthday.

2161
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,070
Lucille, happy birthday!

2162
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:43,590
I'm not singing birthdays at the moment, but I can say happy birthday to you!

2163
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:47,390
Hold on.

2164
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,240
Speaking of, let me...

2165
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,660
Let me do my...

2166
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,560
I have a spray.

2167
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,100
For my throat.

2168
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,520
So good to see you.

2169
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,580
Is there anything you need?

2170
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,920
She's so pretty.

2171
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:07,320
Hello to my sister.

2172
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,840
Is there something I can help you with?

2173
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,780
My sister, oh sister.

2174
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,940
Tell me about the rumors.

2175
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,660
Don't tell anyone else, but someday I'm going to have Ochieva's position.

2176
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:20,500
Just you wait and see.

2177
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,280
Lucy and the Chance knows real talent when he sees it.

2178
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,300
What if I want Ochieva's position?

2179
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,760
Her hair is glitching out.

2180
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,300
Uh-oh.

2181
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,940
They brought back...

2182
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:36,100
They brought back Vincent's hair to get rid of everybody else's.

2183
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,920
The sacrifice must be made.

2184
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,480
I think she...

2185
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,080
I don't know if she would be able to pull off bald.

2186
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,500
Antoinette...

2187
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,320
Oh my god.

2188
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,660
She's really...

2189
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,780
She's glitching out of existence.

2190
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:01,840
Someone must be bald.

2191
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,670
It's like someone's...

2192
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,710
Like flicking the...

2193
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:14,190
Light switch on and off.

2194
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:18,870
Oh Bethesda, you think you can stop the bald?

2195
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,250
Nightmother.

2196
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:23,570
I've always wondered who the Nightmother really is.

2197
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,690
Some say she's an old woman who lives somewhere here in Cyrodiil.

2198
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:29,930
But I'm not so sure.

2199
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:30,210
Cyrodiil.

2200
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:34,070
There must always be a bald one.

2201
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:35,310
Sonata!

2202
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:36,570
Oh my gosh.

2203
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:38,230
It feels like forever since I've seen you.

2204
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:40,090
Happy 14 months.

2205
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:40,710
Thank you.

2206
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:44,690
Oblivion is here...

2207
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:45,470
For their hair.

2208
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:50,510
Good luck, sister.

2209
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,370
I hope you don't get killed.

2210
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:54,190
I mean...

2211
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:55,150
Um...

2212
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:56,570
Well...

2213
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:57,450
You know.

2214
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,590
Why is she so awkward?

2215
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:01,290
Let's see.

2216
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:02,570
What do we want to do now?

2217
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:07,730
Maybe we should go find a cave.

2218
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:11,010
And...

2219
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:12,210
Loot it.

2220
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:16,690
You know, bald is the preferred hairstyle when everyone is trying to be bald.

2221
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:17,550
True.

2222
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,820
She seems nice.

2223
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:24,840
She seems nice.

2224
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,820
Get another job from the vampire guy.

2225
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,560
But they're so...

2226
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,480
They're so...

2227
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,460
I really wish I could kill these people.

2228
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:41,800
Where is it?

2229
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:44,020
It...

2230
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:44,720
Par...

2231
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,160
Par...

2232
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:45,500
Par...

2233
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:45,980
Paranoid.

2234
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:46,400
This one.

2235
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,020
I wish that we could do Glarthor's quest.

2236
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,280
It pays so much.

2237
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:59,120
It pays so much.

2238
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,120
Vampire gives you better weapons.

2239
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:04,800
Oh, true.

2240
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,140
How much?

2241
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:08,420
It pays 1,000 gold.

2242
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:17,270
The arena pays really well.

2243
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:19,570
I'm not much of a fighter, though.

2244
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:22,530
Let's go see it.

2245
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:24,270
Let's go wake him up and get another quest.

2246
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,960
I have a special contract that needs fulfillment.

2247
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:40,940
In truth, I don't wish to offer it to any other family member.

2248
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:43,480
I've come to rely on your abilities.

2249
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:45,640
We're that good?

2250
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:46,820
Oh.

2251
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:47,840
Wait.

2252
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,060
Vincent, your hair.

2253
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:52,220
Will it?

2254
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,180
Will it?

2255
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,060
Side quest is Stop Oblivion.

2256
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,300
And the main quest is Kill Tootie is Sexiest.

2257
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,060
So true!

2258
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,080
We're usually called upon to take a life.

2259
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,280
But not this time.

2260
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:13,240
This contract requires us to stage the assassination of a marked man.

2261
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:14,780
Are you ready?

2262
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:15,540
Okay.

2263
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:17,060
Yes.

2264
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,440
You must go to the city of Coral and break into the house of Francois Mottier.

2265
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,820
Inside, you will find Mottier waiting for you.

2266
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:25,240
Okay.

2267
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,560
Do not kill him.

2268
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,040
Okay.

2269
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:30,120
You see, Francois Mottier is a marked man.

2270
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,140
Francois Mottier.

2271
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,760
He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people.

2272
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:34,320
Oopsie.

2273
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,840
So they have sent an enforcer to kill him.

2274
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:37,380
Whoa.

2275
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:37,800
Here.

2276
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:43,960
You will use this specially poisoned knife to stage Mottier's death in the enforcer's presence.

2277
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,220
Mottier himself will provide more details.

2278
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:47,800
Okay.

2279
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,640
This is an unusual contract.

2280
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:53,660
Mottier had to make a special arrangement with us before it was approved.

2281
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:54,220
Oh.

2282
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,440
I trust in your professionalism.

2283
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,000
Francois Mottier.

2284
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,020
Poison knife.

2285
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:03,760
The blade has been coated with a rare poison called Langerwine.

2286
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:04,720
Langerwine.

2287
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:08,660
One drop in a normal human bloodstream will mimic the effects of death immediately.

2288
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:09,100
Ah.

2289
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:16,740
I have provided you with a vial of antidote, which will be used to revive Francois Mottier after you successfully stage his death.

2290
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:21,220
You should also know that there's only enough Langerwine on the blade for this one contract.

2291
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:21,860
Okay.

2292
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,080
After Mottier is sliced, the knife will be useless.

2293
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:37,660
What if the guy who contracted us is going to be like, I'll pay you even triple, quadruple, double if you slice and dice him.

2294
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:48,800
If you ever cut off his arms and you cut off his legs and you cut off his tongue and you cut off his toes and you cut off his head.

2295
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,900
And I'll pay you quadruple.

2296
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:54,780
Panko!

2297
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:56,680
Thank you so much for the redirect!

2298
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:58,000
Thank you!

2299
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,160
Like the fake death pill at MGS.

2300
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:02,100
Yeah, exactly!

2301
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:04,740
That's an orbital vagabond.

2302
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,080
I don't know.

2303
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,860
Scales of pitiless justice are invisible because they're equipped up the butt.

2304
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:11,440
Oh.

2305
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,120
Huh?

2306
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:19,000
We're about to not go kill somebody.

2307
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:20,680
All raiders coming in?

2308
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:22,600
I just killed a man.

2309
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,620
I got him in...

2310
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:26,500
Actually, I've killed two people this stream.

2311
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,380
We're killing it.

2312
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:31,600
Marilyn, thank you so much for the five gifted!

2313
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,140
Reminding me why I fell in love with the games.

2314
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:37,020
Yeah.

2315
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,120
Thank you for the five gifted!

2316
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,340
Teacup and yon-yon.

2317
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:41,980
Thank you for the gifted!

2318
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:42,640
Do I go?

2319
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,400
Thank you for the five gifted!

2320
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,160
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

2321
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,480
All right, let's go not kill a man.

2322
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:46,960
Good seeing you!

2323
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:47,540
Bye-bye!

2324
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:47,780
Goodbye!

2325
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:49,440
Go back to sleep!

2326
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,140
Mwah!

2327
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,560
Sweet dreams.

2328
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:53,560
Little kisses.

2329
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:56,720
Oh!

2330
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:57,820
I always...

2331
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:59,280
I always go out the wrong way.

2332
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,860
So good to see you!

2333
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,440
Is there any...

2334
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,020
Resting good fries!

2335
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:06,760
Thank you for the five gifted!

2336
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:22,230
Nah, I would have given him a butter kiss if he were bald.

2337
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:26,010
Can you wish my friend Joe a happy birthday?

2338
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:28,090
Happy birthday, Joe!

2339
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:32,270
Better not be Joe Mama.

2340
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:35,610
So we need to go to Quarrel.

2341
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:36,870
Here!

2342
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:39,670
And we meet a Frenchman!

2343
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,700
The French.

2344
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,040
The French.

2345
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,140
Oh, it's daytime now.

2346
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,460
Only asking for a single coin.

2347
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,020
What if there was...

2348
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:03,520
Wait, wasn't there a guy who was called something the leech?

2349
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:09,880
Okay, so it's...

2350
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,000
Francois Mortieri's house.

2351
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:14,140
What's going on with you?

2352
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,820
What's going on with you?

2353
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:16,840
This one?

2354
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,800
Wow, this guy's got a fancy looking place.

2355
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:30,040
If you're expecting me, why'd you lock the door?

2356
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:31,980
Oh!

2357
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,060
I never fail!

2358
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:38,280
Phil, thank you so much for the tagging to take you!

2359
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:42,760
Ooh, my lock...

2360
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,680
Lock picking went out.

2361
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:45,500
Hee hee.

2362
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,400
Impossible.

2363
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,320
Oh.

2364
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:55,920
Oh.

2365
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:56,660
Oh.

2366
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:57,580
Well, um...

2367
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,220
Hello.

2368
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:01,240
You must be the one Lucy and Lachance told me about.

2369
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,020
We're in an O loop.

2370
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:03,060
I've been expecting you.

2371
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:03,840
Oh, oh, oh.

2372
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,240
We haven't got much time, I'm afraid.

2373
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:08,640
I borrowed quite a bit of gold from some underworld types.

2374
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:09,980
I, uh...

2375
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:10,880
I missed a payment.

2376
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,860
Now they don't even want the money.

2377
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:14,640
They say I insulted them.

2378
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,600
They've sent an enforcer to kill me.

2379
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:16,940
Oh!

2380
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,580
His name is Hides' Heart.

2381
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,020
But he's on his way here now.

2382
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:21,760
That's why I hired you.

2383
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,780
So you can fake my death.

2384
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,760
Hides' Heart.

2385
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,220
Okay, um...

2386
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,980
By scythus, spit it out, you worm!

2387
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,040
I'll be mean to him.

2388
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:32,040
Oh, sorry.

2389
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:33,760
Please, I'm sorry.

2390
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,240
See, when Hides' Heart gets here, I'll put on a little act.

2391
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,120
Then you cut me with the knife and it looks like I die.

2392
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:44,380
You must then flee from Coral, and Hides' Heart must not be killed.

2393
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:44,760
Okay.

2394
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:47,420
That way he can go back and tell his employers I'm dead.

2395
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:52,160
If you wait a day, my body will be put on display in the Coral Chapel Undercroft.

2396
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:55,540
You can come to me then and administer the antidote.

2397
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:56,680
Got all that?

2398
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:57,620
Good.

2399
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:58,420
Oh, okay.

2400
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,720
Hides' Heart will be here any moment.

2401
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:00,060
Oh.

2402
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:00,900
Get ready.

2403
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,160
Oh, I do hope this works.

2404
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:04,480
Oh.

2405
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:05,060
Uh.

2406
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:05,700
Okay.

2407
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:06,420
Uh.

2408
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,540
I'm getting ready.

2409
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:08,400
Um.

2410
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,760
I use the Langerwine Blade.

2411
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,460
I have it ready.

2412
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:19,500
The lockpick failed so that you could correctly say lockpick.

2413
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:20,200
It's a trade.

2414
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,020
Hides' Heart.

2415
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,580
Carebearer Assassin Extraordinaire.

2416
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,360
Okay.

2417
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:27,800
I'm here.

2418
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:32,980
Motieri, I know you're in there.

2419
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:33,760
No reaction.

2420
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,020
My employers are mostly pleased.

2421
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:39,900
I'm coming in, and you can beg for your life.

2422
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,540
Not that we'll...

2423
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:48,630
Motier, I am here to exact payment.

2424
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:49,690
In blood.

2425
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:52,190
You will...

2426
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,690
Who is this?

2427
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:54,890
Oh, no.

2428
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:56,190
What am I to do?

2429
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:59,590
An underworld enforcer and a dark brotherhood assassin.

2430
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:02,070
Both here to kill poor Francois.

2431
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:04,050
The dark brotherhood?

2432
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:07,650
Oh, you have been a naughty boy, Motier, haven't you?

2433
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:09,530
Stand aside, assassin.

2434
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:10,610
Motier...

2435
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:13,470
I did it.

2436
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:15,190
I must now flee.

2437
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:16,950
Oh, shoot.

2438
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:17,690
Get me out of here.

2439
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:23,810
The acting...

2440
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:24,730
Could have been better.

2441
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:28,610
I'm fleeing Coral.

2442
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:36,040
They're not going after me, are they?

2443
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:40,800
Now I wait a day.

2444
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,500
What time is it?

2445
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:43,340
Oh.

2446
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,560
I have fled Coral, and Hyde's heart has not been killed.

2447
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:52,200
I must now wait a day so Motier can be discovered and placed in the Coral Chapel Undercroft.

2448
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:55,860
There I must find Motier and administer the antidote that will revive them.

2449
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:58,060
Oh.

2450
02:00:59,380 --> 02:00:59,820
Dear.

2451
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,280
Okay.

2452
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:09,470
Let's save.

2453
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:13,490
And we wait a day.

2454
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:16,270
We just chill, I guess.

2455
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:20,830
Let's wait 24 hours.

2456
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:23,750
Yeah, let's just go inside and wait.

2457
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,670
Maybe.

2458
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:30,250
Ytina just stands there for a whole 24 hours.

2459
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:35,130
Hopefully, no one bothers me.

2460
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:39,350
I'm going to stand right here really menacingly.

2461
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:58,740
Whoa.

2462
02:01:59,460 --> 02:01:59,600
Oh.

2463
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:05,820
Wow, that really worked.

2464
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:11,050
Yawn.

2465
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:11,790
Good morning.

2466
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,050
How's anyone?

2467
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:18,930
Stop right there, criminal scum.

2468
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:21,290
Nobody breaks the law on my watch.

2469
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:23,670
I'm confiscating your stolen goods.

2470
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:26,570
Now pay your fine, or it's off to jail.

2471
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:40,000
How did he know?

2472
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:45,420
It's only 40 gold.

2473
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:48,960
That's like almost half of what I earned on my last mission.

2474
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,360
I did save.

2475
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,360
I'll just, I'll just, uh, reload.

2476
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:53,780
That's too bad.

2477
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:54,260
Okay.

2478
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:56,440
Oh.

2479
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,600
Oh.

2480
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,180
I'll just, uh, reload.

2481
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:10,380
What am I in trouble for?

2482
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:11,240
Is it the key?

2483
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:16,020
How else was I supposed to get out?

2484
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:26,620
I was all I wanted to ask him if it was before my body was discovered.

2485
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:34,800
Jail is like eating a second home at this point.

2486
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,980
What if I just ditched the key somewhere?

2487
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,920
You should be able to pay off your bounty at the thieves' guild.

2488
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,240
Yeah, we'll have to do that.

2489
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,360
Your bounty is from the last stream.

2490
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,040
Because you were caught trespassing.

2491
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,540
No kidding?

2492
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:55,380
No.

2493
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,700
No way.

2494
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:02,340
Wow, these deer also haven't moved in 24 hours.

2495
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,960
Oh, there's an imp!

2496
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:13,360
There's an imp!

2497
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:15,600
Let's see if I can get him.

2498
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,220
Wait.

2499
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,440
Sniper attack!

2500
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,000
Yippee!

2501
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,460
Look at that.

2502
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:30,820
Look at the...

2503
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:32,040
What's it called?

2504
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:37,660
There's like the trail whenever I do that.

2505
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,680
Looks kind of funky.

2506
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,480
Little Ken doll...

2507
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,680
Looking buddy.

2508
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:50,260
What are you doing here, anyway?

2509
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:51,680
Causing mischief.

2510
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:51,980
Okay.

2511
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:55,700
The ghost thing.

2512
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:03,330
It was in the knee?

2513
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,210
How apt.

2514
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:13,690
You can check your current bounties and your character stats.

2515
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:14,490
Oh.

2516
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:18,730
And no, if you have a bounty, it won't just go away by itself.

2517
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,430
Every guard knows what you did forever.

2518
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:21,110
Wait.

2519
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:22,350
Character stats here?

2520
02:05:26,190 --> 02:05:26,650
Sneet!

2521
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:29,010
I forgot that was our class.

2522
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:35,750
Cure factions.

2523
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:38,730
Wait.

2524
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:40,850
How many locks have I picked?

2525
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:41,950
44!

2526
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:47,310
Which is it under?

2527
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,580
It was near the top?

2528
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,060
Bounty.

2529
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,000
40.

2530
02:05:57,620 --> 02:06:00,620
What do you mean my infamy is 9?

2531
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,020
My fame is only 5.

2532
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:06,840
Item stole.

2533
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:08,780
Wow.

2534
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:10,580
Okay.

2535
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,000
Don't talk to the guard.

2536
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:12,700
Screw you.

2537
02:06:19,510 --> 02:06:19,990
Hello.

2538
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,450
I don't think we've met.

2539
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:23,070
Are you new in town?

2540
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:24,690
Ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne.

2541
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:25,770
Ah, yes, I am.

2542
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:26,610
Pleased to meet you.

2543
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:27,470
Likewise.

2544
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:30,570
I'm always glad to meet someone new.

2545
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:31,510
Welcome.

2546
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:34,790
I'm sure my mother would be glad to meet you as well.

2547
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:36,130
Why is your mom going to meet me?

2548
02:06:37,930 --> 02:06:41,110
My mother owns northern goods and trade in Coral.

2549
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:42,590
Okay.

2550
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:44,390
Any rumors?

2551
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:47,370
Have you seen Valis Odile recently?

2552
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:50,790
Spends all day in the tavern since his boys left.

2553
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:51,230
Oh.

2554
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:54,570
Hope you're having a great weekend.

2555
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:55,550
Thank you, Riot.

2556
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,190
You too.

2557
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:58,030
Be seeing you.

2558
02:06:58,230 --> 02:06:58,650
Bye-bye.

2559
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:00,470
Oh, I gotta go to the chapel.

2560
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:05,010
That's the mage's guild.

2561
02:07:05,570 --> 02:07:07,110
I gotta go to the chapel.

2562
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:13,970
Look at the dog.

2563
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:14,670
Have mercy.

2564
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:16,730
Just one coin.

2565
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:19,670
Look at...

2566
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:21,310
I've never seen the dogs before.

2567
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:23,770
They're so cute.

2568
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:25,930
They're huge.

2569
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:28,910
Don't look at me like that.

2570
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:29,870
Nermous.

2571
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:35,060
He looks so polite.

2572
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:37,300
When he's standing there.

2573
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:43,140
That's my cue.

2574
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:46,580
Why does he look like that?

2575
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,200
Why is he looking so polite?

2576
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,600
Why is anybody saying anything or doing anything?

2577
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,000
Okay.

2578
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:58,820
Oh.

2579
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:00,240
Bye.

2580
02:08:06,450 --> 02:08:07,850
Just a chill guy.

2581
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:13,450
So, technically, I think I'm not allowed down here.

2582
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:15,430
Isn't that the case?

2583
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:18,950
Oh, wait.

2584
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:20,350
I have to go to the undercroft.

2585
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:21,430
Right.

2586
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:22,550
Wait.

2587
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:23,470
What was the quest?

2588
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:26,370
Oh, gosh.

2589
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:26,950
I pressed Q.

2590
02:08:27,530 --> 02:08:28,110
For quest.

2591
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:29,530
Let me just...

2592
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:30,510
Quest.

2593
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:34,690
Yes, it was the undercroft.

2594
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:34,930
Okay.

2595
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,390
This one is better.

2596
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:38,950
Okay.

2597
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:41,250
Aren't there skellies down here?

2598
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:44,490
It starts with a hundred disposition towards everyone.

2599
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,830
Since she's such a good being.

2600
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:46,950
Aww.

2601
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:53,670
Where's our guy?

2602
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:56,790
Oh, he's close.

2603
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,720
There he is.

2604
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:04,880
Oh.

2605
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:07,320
I can take his stuff.

2606
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,600
I have administered the Langerwine antidote.

2607
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:15,900
And Francois Mortier has awakened from his poison-induced sleep.

2608
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:20,260
I should now speak with him and make sure he's well enough to travel to the Grey Mare.

2609
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:23,560
I don't think he would have anything in his pockets anyway.

2610
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,280
Hello?

2611
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:26,880
Wake up.

2612
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:28,400
Wake up.

2613
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:32,170
Oh.

2614
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:35,090
I'm a bit stiff, but quite fine otherwise.

2615
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,410
He did not look dead.

2616
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:37,990
He literally was moving.

2617
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:40,310
My family members are buried here, you know.

2618
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:44,130
Which leads me to something I may have failed to mention before.

2619
02:09:44,590 --> 02:09:49,350
My ancestors will see my revival as a desecration of their tomb.

2620
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:51,450
This undercroft is...

2621
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:53,610
Well, quite cursed.

2622
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:53,990
Huh?

2623
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:59,490
Any desecration will cause my ancestors to rise from their graves and defend their resting place.

2624
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,450
I can hear them coming as we speak.

2625
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:01,890
What?

2626
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:03,050
You must protect me.

2627
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:06,030
Escort me to the Grey Mare where I can buy passage out of coral.

2628
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:07,070
Uh, what?

2629
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:07,770
Here they come.

2630
02:10:07,930 --> 02:10:08,190
What?

2631
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:09,710
Oh my, Aunt Margaret.

2632
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:11,550
You're looking the worst for where?

2633
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:12,230
No way.

2634
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:13,790
Where?

2635
02:10:14,610 --> 02:10:15,930
Oh my god, there's zombies.

2636
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:19,150
Oh my god.

2637
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:32,580
Sir, this is something you really should have mentioned beforehand, I fear.

2638
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:35,180
Excuse me?

2639
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:37,700
Oh, don't just go running at them.

2640
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,260
Oh my god.

2641
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:41,500
Did he just do a spin?

2642
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,320
Oh my god.

2643
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:44,460
Oh my god.

2644
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:51,280
Sir, I can take the mort flesh.

2645
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:56,420
The flying back kick.

2646
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:58,840
Okay, Francois.

2647
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,240
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it.

2648
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,280
Don't do it, don't do it.

2649
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:04,560
Don't run!

2650
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,560
Okay, good.

2651
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:08,200
Oh, stop it.

2652
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,480
I forgot to mention that now my ancestors are angry at me.

2653
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:18,780
I have desecrated their grave.

2654
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:22,200
Uh, was it this way?

2655
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:23,200
I think so.

2656
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:23,960
Come on, come on.

2657
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,700
I can't believe this.

2658
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:30,660
I, I can't believe this is happening.

2659
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:37,200
That is, you will be quiet about the dead man walking.

2660
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:46,980
That is kind of awkward.

2661
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,320
Don't mind the zombies downstairs.

2662
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:52,460
Okay, where do I take you?

2663
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:57,840
No, it's safe.

2664
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,380
Follow me.

2665
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:02,760
Imagine if he tried to rush and punch cars.

2666
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:06,280
Where am I taking you?

2667
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:07,020
Oh, let's go this way.

2668
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:08,780
Let's follow the red arrow.

2669
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,420
This is right under a church.

2670
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,580
You'd think a priest would have exorcised the place.

2671
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,100
I know.

2672
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:18,260
I'm a little confused.

2673
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:24,780
Wait, so every time I would go to the, to the thieves' guild and be, it would say...

2674
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,280
Oh, in here.

2675
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:30,140
Where'd he go?

2676
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:31,020
Hello?

2677
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:34,420
Oh, there you are.

2678
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,180
Where were you?

2679
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,880
And it said, get rid of my bounty?

2680
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,060
I could have done that.

2681
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,000
Ah, the Grey Mare.

2682
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:46,760
Coral's finest repository of wine, women, and song.

2683
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,240
I haven't time for fools.

2684
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:51,640
Be seeing ya.

2685
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:55,360
Okay, you walked up to her.

2686
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:57,580
What am I supposed to do here?

2687
02:12:57,580 --> 02:12:58,640
Ah, the Grey Mare.

2688
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:02,440
From here, I will be able to arrange for transportation out of Cyrodiil.

2689
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:05,180
You have served me well, Assassin.

2690
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:05,840
You're welcome.

2691
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:07,540
Francois is forever in your debt.

2692
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:08,820
Farewell.

2693
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:12,200
Why did we help this guy?

2694
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:19,110
How much money did he...

2695
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:22,250
Thanks again, Assassin.

2696
02:13:22,590 --> 02:13:24,610
Your services have been invaluable.

2697
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:26,950
Soon I will find passage...

2698
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:27,410
Okay.

2699
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:28,870
Paul?

2700
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:32,770
Bye.

2701
02:13:34,450 --> 02:13:35,610
But, like...

2702
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:37,990
How much money did he pay...

2703
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:39,350
To the...

2704
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:41,010
Dark Brotherhood, you know?

2705
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:41,730
To...

2706
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:42,610
To...

2707
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:45,170
Get this kind of service.

2708
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:46,710
Like a non-kill.

2709
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,150
Unless...

2710
02:13:48,650 --> 02:13:51,050
We just didn't like the moneylenders...

2711
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:52,470
And we were trying to spite them.

2712
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:56,190
You know?

2713
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:04,120
I don't know you, and I don't care to know you.

2714
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:07,480
You do know me, actually.

2715
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:09,300
But, yeah.

2716
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:11,000
Keep pretending like you don't...

2717
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,120
You don't know me.

2718
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:14,300
I have no bounty.

2719
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:19,260
I don't know you, and I don't care to know you.

2720
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:22,220
I'm gonna start saying that to people on...

2721
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:23,460
Oh, on the streets.

2722
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,020
You know how, like...

2723
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:25,740
Have...

2724
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:26,140
Have...

2725
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:27,620
Actually, I'm gonna look this up afterwards.

2726
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,220
I don't...

2727
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:28,900
I wonder if...

2728
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:29,780
If...

2729
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:31,780
I feel like this is the perfect game...

2730
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:33,780
For, like, Mega64 to...

2731
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:36,360
To do, you know?

2732
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:38,720
Like, have them do their little skits.

2733
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:44,020
Where they just...

2734
02:14:44,020 --> 02:14:46,060
Someone walks by, and they just say something.

2735
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,340
I don't know if they've ever done one before.

2736
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,440
Of the skim.

2737
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:01,000
Oh, cheeva.

2738
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:03,940
Where's our bald man?

2739
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,680
They did a Skyrim.

2740
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:07,640
Ah, okay.

2741
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:11,100
Oh, I did see Joel Haver's Oblivion video.

2742
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,220
I did, I did.

2743
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:14,540
That was pretty funny, too.

2744
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,560
Oh.

2745
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,760
Ah, so Mottieri has escaped.

2746
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:21,780
Well done.

2747
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:23,440
I've reached Eliminator rank.

2748
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:25,680
As payment, I am pleased to award you this amulet.

2749
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,920
Cruelty's heart.

2750
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:27,400
Cruelty's heart.

2751
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:29,280
As well as another advancement in rank.

2752
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:29,920
Nice.

2753
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:32,880
I hereby bestow upon you the title of Eliminator.

2754
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:33,440
Wow.

2755
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:34,720
Your blood is cold.

2756
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:35,740
Your heart, hard.

2757
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:39,500
You exemplify everything the Dark Brotherhood stands for.

2758
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:41,620
I present to you now this key.

2759
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:45,020
It unlocks the well behind the abandoned house above.

2760
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:45,640
Ah, nice.

2761
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:46,360
Thank you.

2762
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:48,840
Use it to gain hidden, quick access to this sanctuary.

2763
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,160
Thank you, finally.

2764
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,400
Goodness gracious.

2765
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:52,600
Oh.

2766
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:54,080
Oh.

2767
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,320
So I got what else?

2768
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,380
What else did you give me?

2769
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,540
Some kind of heart?

2770
02:16:12,810 --> 02:16:13,690
The necklace.

2771
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:19,250
What would it be under?

2772
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:20,910
Oh, here it is.

2773
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:21,890
Cruelty's heart.

2774
02:16:22,830 --> 02:16:24,350
Fortify willpower on self.

2775
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:26,690
Fortify strength on self.

2776
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:30,750
Wait, it looks so good.

2777
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:34,990
Target wasn't eliminated.

2778
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:37,850
I now bestow upon you the title of Eliminator.

2779
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:43,030
We're just that good at doing our job.

2780
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:47,390
Um, the quest was eliminated.

2781
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:50,850
Excuse me, sister.

2782
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:52,430
Can you spare a moment?

2783
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,490
Yes, brother.

2784
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:56,550
Is it true what I've heard about your most recent contract?

2785
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:59,310
You were forced to eliminate everyone?

2786
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:02,290
Even the non-essentials?

2787
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:02,990
Oh.

2788
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:05,490
You must mean the orphanage contract.

2789
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:05,990
The orphanage contract.

2790
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:07,010
Well, it's true.

2791
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:10,530
The children actually tried to defend themselves.

2792
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:11,990
Poor dears.

2793
02:17:13,470 --> 02:17:18,570
Yes, well, if there's one thing you know how to do, it's get yourself out of an unwinnable situation.

2794
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:25,970
Oh, well, I'd love to continue chatting, but I have to prepare for my next contract.

2795
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:28,390
You know, that mages guild matter.

2796
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,710
You understand.

2797
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:31,910
Sithis be with you, sister.

2798
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:35,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2799
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:38,790
Um, I think...

2800
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:38,850
Oh.

2801
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:43,570
Gift from the night mother herself.

2802
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:46,690
Please, tell me how I can help.

2803
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:48,670
She's getting right in between the arm.

2804
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:53,390
Oh, my God.

2805
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:56,670
This is attempted murder.

2806
02:17:58,890 --> 02:18:04,750
I love how they just really try to make this dark, um, brotherhood, like, as...

2807
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:07,630
as evil as possible.

2808
02:18:07,870 --> 02:18:08,990
They're just like, oh, yes.

2809
02:18:09,470 --> 02:18:10,610
From the night mother herself.

2810
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:11,810
Please.

2811
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:15,890
Well, now, you are an ambitious one, aren't you?

2812
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:16,410
Yeah.

2813
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:18,650
I'm afraid I have no more contracts for you.

2814
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:22,010
Our time working together has come to an end.

2815
02:18:22,670 --> 02:18:26,310
Instead, you must report to Ochiever here in the sanctuary.

2816
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:32,190
She will be providing all your contracts from now on and is waiting for you as we speak.

2817
02:18:32,350 --> 02:18:32,830
Oh, okay.

2818
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:37,290
Before you go, however, I intend to make good on an offer I made some time ago.

2819
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:42,150
As a vampire, I may pass my gift on to others as I see fit.

2820
02:18:42,510 --> 02:18:44,030
You have served me well.

2821
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:47,150
And I choose now to extend that gift to you.

2822
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:51,550
Shall I use my dark powers and turn you into a vampire?

2823
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:55,430
Wait.

2824
02:18:55,430 --> 02:18:55,770
Wait.

2825
02:19:00,430 --> 02:19:01,330
It sucks?

2826
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:02,390
Wait, why?

2827
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:03,250
It's not worth?

2828
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:05,330
Wait, why?

2829
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:06,590
It's not good?

2830
02:19:07,770 --> 02:19:08,330
What?

2831
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:11,410
It kind of sucks in this game.

2832
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:14,130
It's the worst?

2833
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:20,610
You take damage from the sun.

2834
02:19:21,650 --> 02:19:22,610
Oh, yeah.

2835
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:26,750
I'll think about it.

2836
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:27,390
Not right now.

2837
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:27,890
Thank you.

2838
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:30,790
Yes, I can understand your trepidation.

2839
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:35,670
For it is not every day one is invited to join the ranks of the undead, eh?

2840
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:38,630
If you ever change your mind, fear not.

2841
02:19:39,010 --> 02:19:40,910
My offer will always be open.

2842
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:45,830
Simply return and speak to me about the dark gift, and we can proceed.

2843
02:19:47,070 --> 02:19:51,830
Because, like, what if I go to those people that I need to kill for Glarthor, and I just...

2844
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:54,150
You know?

2845
02:19:54,330 --> 02:19:54,950
And then...

2846
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:56,330
They can't even scream.

2847
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:58,230
Eat you now!

2848
02:19:58,830 --> 02:20:00,350
Where the hell you been, loca?

2849
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:08,180
Already undead.

2850
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:08,860
Thanks now.

2851
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:12,700
I was gonna say, though, about this...

2852
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:13,600
Goodbye.

2853
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:14,560
This guild.

2854
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,520
They're just so funny.

2855
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:18,280
They'll be like, Oh, that contract you had...

2856
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:23,560
About killing the poor puppies that were gifted to the...

2857
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:24,620
To the...

2858
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:27,140
To the sick, bedridden children.

2859
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:28,200
How did that go?

2860
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:32,240
And they're like, Yes, I murdered every puppy and every child.

2861
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:34,980
They're like...

2862
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:40,000
They're like, This is the evil guild, and we'd spare no one.

2863
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:41,760
It's so funny.

2864
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:45,000
It's, like, comical how...

2865
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,280
How evil they are.

2866
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:47,840
Oh, Tiva!

2867
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:49,040
Ah, greetings.

2868
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:50,900
I have been waiting for you.

2869
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:52,880
As Vicente surely told you...

2870
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,840
Oh, his name is Vicente.

2871
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:55,120
Sorry, I've been calling him Vincent.

2872
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,740
Tim has come to an end.

2873
02:20:57,180 --> 02:21:01,420
From now on, you will receive all assignments directly from me.

2874
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:04,740
In fact, your next contract is available now.

2875
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,320
Oh, gosh.

2876
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:14,900
Ever since I got my new chair, it's awesome for stretching my back.

2877
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:16,160
Contract.

2878
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:16,920
Um, contract.

2879
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:17,480
Contract.

2880
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:21,840
In the Imperial City, there lives a High Elf who must be removed from existence.

2881
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:25,300
Finding this person may prove challenging.

2882
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:26,700
Are you interested?

2883
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:29,860
Always.

2884
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:31,380
I accept the contract.

2885
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:34,180
I knew you wouldn't be able to resist.

2886
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:37,940
Your target is a High Elf named Falien.

2887
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:42,820
He lives somewhere in the Imperial City and fancies long walks.

2888
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:43,300
Oh.

2889
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:45,660
Unfortunately, that's all we know.

2890
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:53,280
We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.

2891
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:53,660
Okay.

2892
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:57,500
This contract will require a bit of detective work.

2893
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:03,180
I suggest you speak to your fellow brothers and sisters and see if they can offer any advice.

2894
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:04,100
High Elf.

2895
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:04,940
Ah, yes.

2896
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,640
There is one more thing.

2897
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:06,980
Yeah?

2898
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:13,280
The Imperial City is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named Adamus Philida.

2899
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:15,140
Do you know who that is?

2900
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:17,940
Uh...

2901
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:19,400
Philida!

2902
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,300
That self-righteous lapdog!

2903
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,780
Actually, I don't think I've ever heard of this guy.

2904
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:32,150
Have I?

2905
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:36,130
He's the one from the docks.

2906
02:22:37,790 --> 02:22:38,810
I don't know.

2907
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:43,650
Philida has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood.

2908
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:48,730
And he becomes rather irate when our duties take us to the Imperial City.

2909
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:49,410
I see.

2910
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:52,990
When that happens, he tends to make our lives uncomfortable.

2911
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:58,710
Let's not give the good captain any reason to go poking around in our affairs, hmm?

2912
02:22:59,070 --> 02:22:59,530
Okay.

2913
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:03,970
If possible, do away with Feli in some place out of the way.

2914
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:07,190
Definitely indoors with no other people around.

2915
02:23:07,330 --> 02:23:07,610
Okay.

2916
02:23:07,610 --> 02:23:10,050
A secure location with no witnesses.

2917
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:10,570
Okay.

2918
02:23:11,150 --> 02:23:13,450
This will make it look like a simple murder.

2919
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:17,550
Philida will be none the wiser and you'll receive a nice bonus.

2920
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:19,910
Now go, and may Sithis go with you.

2921
02:23:20,610 --> 02:23:24,090
Hearing the phrase detective work in a fantasy setting is odd.

2922
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:24,910
I know.

2923
02:23:25,050 --> 02:23:26,490
I feel like they're going to give me a...

2924
02:23:27,310 --> 02:23:29,770
Like a long coat and a...

2925
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:31,170
And a...

2926
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:32,190
A top...

2927
02:23:32,190 --> 02:23:32,810
Not top hat.

2928
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:34,650
A fedora or something.

2929
02:23:35,530 --> 02:23:38,150
Man, I love mean Tony socks.

2930
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:39,010
Thank you.

2931
02:23:39,390 --> 02:23:39,670
Thank you.

2932
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:40,750
Thank you for 15 months.

2933
02:23:41,350 --> 02:23:43,050
And now we can use this.

2934
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:46,670
All right.

2935
02:23:46,730 --> 02:23:48,350
Let's go find Phelan.

2936
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,150
We're Phelan.

2937
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:54,370
Oh, no, no.

2938
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:56,810
We ain't failing this jab.

2939
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:03,590
Oh, I think we need to go...

2940
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,870
Oh, wait.

2941
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:05,910
They said to talk to our brothers and sisters.

2942
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:07,010
Just kidding.

2943
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:10,790
Brothers.

2944
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:14,690
That was not minus two.

2945
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:20,370
Fedora Minto is on my wish list.

2946
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:23,690
But, of course, what troubles you?

2947
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:26,530
Everyone's talking about your latest exploits.

2948
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:27,650
I know what you're thinking.

2949
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:28,610
Go, Gron.

2950
02:24:28,990 --> 02:24:30,590
He's too big to be sneaky.

2951
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:32,290
Well, you're right.

2952
02:24:32,610 --> 02:24:32,890
Me?

2953
02:24:33,130 --> 02:24:36,250
I like to just go in and hack my targets to pieces.

2954
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:36,850
Ha ha.

2955
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:37,470
Ha ha.

2956
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:38,810
Um.

2957
02:24:39,810 --> 02:24:40,230
Contract.

2958
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:42,230
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

2959
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:44,070
You kill them up close.

2960
02:24:44,330 --> 02:24:45,390
Face to face.

2961
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:47,070
And you still get the bonus.

2962
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:49,870
I wish all the contracts were like that.

2963
02:24:51,070 --> 02:24:52,830
That's not helpful at all.

2964
02:24:53,010 --> 02:24:53,670
Happy hunting, my sister.

2965
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:55,870
Not only did you eliminate the target, but...

2966
02:24:55,870 --> 02:24:55,990
Oh.

2967
02:24:56,950 --> 02:24:57,270
You...

2968
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:58,330
Ah, dear friend.

2969
02:24:58,510 --> 02:24:59,390
Sorry, I don't mean the button, but...

2970
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:00,450
May I steal a moment of your time?

2971
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:04,310
I have a rather delicate situation I was hoping you could help me with.

2972
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:05,150
Big surprise hydration check.

2973
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:05,770
I've been drinking!

2974
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,470
This is a personal matter.

2975
02:25:06,630 --> 02:25:09,850
And will have no bearing on your standing within the Dark Brotherhood.

2976
02:25:10,430 --> 02:25:11,770
Would you like to hear more?

2977
02:25:11,890 --> 02:25:12,510
Wait, what's this?

2978
02:25:13,570 --> 02:25:14,350
Uh, yes?

2979
02:25:14,350 --> 02:25:16,850
I find your decision most agreeable.

2980
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:18,630
Now, the details.

2981
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:23,710
Far south of here, on the southern end of Cyrodiil, lies a swamp called Bogwater.

2982
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:24,530
You're giving me a job?

2983
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,950
Called Bogwater.

2984
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:25,790
Bogwater.

2985
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:31,030
Hiding in that swamp, you will find an Argonian shadow scale named Scartail.

2986
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:35,810
Kill this renegade and bring me his heart as proof of the deed.

2987
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:37,930
Why?

2988
02:25:40,890 --> 02:25:41,450
Why?

2989
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,470
What do I get out of this?

2990
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:49,710
I do so love pursuing a contract in the Imperial City.

2991
02:25:50,090 --> 02:25:54,490
The alleys, the shadows, the challenge of evading for this Legion troops.

2992
02:25:54,570 --> 02:25:55,830
You can ask why?

2993
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:56,130
Okay.

2994
02:25:56,330 --> 02:25:57,190
I envy you.

2995
02:25:57,430 --> 02:25:58,210
You want this?

2996
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:00,870
Scartail, there it is.

2997
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:11,210
When Ocheva and I train with the Dark Brotherhood as children, we befriended another initiate, a shadow scale by the name of Scartail.

2998
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:13,710
The three of us were inseparable.

2999
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:18,590
When our training was completed, we reluctantly parted ways.

3000
02:26:19,310 --> 02:26:23,750
But now, now, the unthinkable has happened.

3001
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:24,450
What happened?

3002
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:30,510
Scartail has fled Black Marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin.

3003
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:33,570
This is an act of treason.

3004
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:36,490
This treachery must be punished.

3005
02:26:36,690 --> 02:26:40,870
Just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member.

3006
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:45,490
A shadow scale is forbidden from slaying another shadow scale.

3007
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:50,370
That is why you must go to Bogwater and eliminate that treacherous snake.

3008
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:53,330
Please, kill Scartail.

3009
02:26:53,330 --> 02:26:56,910
So Ocheva and I can put this matter behind us.

3010
02:26:57,170 --> 02:26:57,770
I see.

3011
02:26:58,810 --> 02:26:59,390
I see.

3012
02:26:59,630 --> 02:26:59,970
I see.

3013
02:27:00,170 --> 02:27:00,730
I see.

3014
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:05,590
May you walk always in the shadow of Sixth, dear sister.

3015
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:06,190
Thank you.

3016
02:27:06,190 --> 02:27:06,770
Thank you.

3017
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:07,890
Tell me how I can help.

3018
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,610
Shut up.

3019
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:10,110
Why is everybody talking to me at once?

3020
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:14,550
Nobody is telling me any actual helpful information about my quest.

3021
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:15,710
What?

3022
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:16,790
What are you doing over here?

3023
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:19,950
I didn't know the skelly walked this far.

3024
02:27:20,130 --> 02:27:21,710
What are you going into the bedroom for?

3025
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:25,210
I am honored by your presence.

3026
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:25,530
Bye.

3027
02:27:25,810 --> 02:27:27,690
How can Ocheva be of assistance?

3028
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:33,260
He's sleepy.

3029
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,380
It's time to switch out.

3030
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:37,920
This guy's...

3031
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:38,120
Oh, wait.

3032
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,120
Get away from me.

3033
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:40,040
Yeah, this guy's the jerk.

3034
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:40,480
You again?

3035
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:42,240
I thought I'd made it clear.

3036
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:43,180
I am not looking for...

3037
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:43,360
Oh, wait.

3038
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:44,060
He doesn't give...

3039
02:27:44,060 --> 02:27:44,800
He doesn't give help.

3040
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:46,040
Foul-smelling ape.

3041
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:46,920
You're mean.

3042
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:54,500
His rickety bones.

3043
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,800
It fills my heart with warmth.

3044
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:01,040
So mean.

3045
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,300
Okay.

3046
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:11,460
I'm gonna wake you up.

3047
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:17,330
Oh, she's gotta come all the way over here.

3048
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:18,310
Hello, dear sister.

3049
02:28:19,110 --> 02:28:20,870
Is there something I can help you with?

3050
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,710
This is jump scare.

3051
02:28:22,450 --> 02:28:23,530
Know what I'd do?

3052
02:28:24,150 --> 02:28:25,290
Talk to Falien.

3053
02:28:25,690 --> 02:28:27,130
Learn who he is.

3054
02:28:27,850 --> 02:28:30,230
Maybe then you can lead him to a secluded place.

3055
02:28:31,450 --> 02:28:32,790
Then, when you're alone...

3056
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:34,470
You know.

3057
02:28:35,530 --> 02:28:37,430
Oh, there's some actual good advice.

3058
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:38,450
Good luck, sister.

3059
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:40,330
I hope you don't get killed.

3060
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:41,870
I mean...

3061
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:43,130
A little red...

3062
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:44,090
Well...

3063
02:28:44,090 --> 02:28:44,710
Schemer.

3064
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:48,890
So we gotta seduce Falien.

3065
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:51,690
I think E-Tina...

3066
02:28:51,690 --> 02:28:51,850
Wait.

3067
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:55,390
We have the scales that make our personality ass.

3068
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:00,190
What are you doing?

3069
02:29:00,270 --> 02:29:00,430
Are you...

3070
02:29:00,430 --> 02:29:02,290
It fills my heart with warmth to see you again.

3071
02:29:02,290 --> 02:29:02,410
Excuse me.

3072
02:29:02,550 --> 02:29:03,230
I'm trying to leave.

3073
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:05,410
Okay.

3074
02:29:05,410 --> 02:29:06,370
We're gonna be...

3075
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:08,810
We're gonna be...

3076
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:10,730
We're gonna be...

3077
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:12,710
So...

3078
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:13,530
Cute.

3079
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:19,110
Let's go find this guy.

3080
02:29:19,290 --> 02:29:20,350
I guess we go here.

3081
02:29:21,790 --> 02:29:22,310
Falien.

3082
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:24,330
Hat-duck.

3083
02:29:24,850 --> 02:29:26,250
Hat-duck.

3084
02:29:27,410 --> 02:29:27,930
Wait.

3085
02:29:28,130 --> 02:29:28,870
What time is it?

3086
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:30,790
Also, since we're at the Imperial City...

3087
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:31,970
We can get our bounty...

3088
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:32,810
Taken away.

3089
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:38,600
Wait.

3090
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:40,500
It's...

3091
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,080
The waterfront, right?

3092
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:46,800
What time is it, though?

3093
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:51,520
I think it's too early.

3094
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:54,940
Let's go to the waterfront.

3095
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:55,900
It might...

3096
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:56,560
I rather...

3097
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:57,280
I think it's...

3098
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:57,620
Too late.

3099
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:59,480
I think...

3100
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:00,360
He might have...

3101
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:00,760
Gone home.

3102
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:02,300
We could try.

3103
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:02,940
We could try.

3104
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:07,400
I also wanna go kill that guy in the bog.

3105
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,320
That sounds exciting.

3106
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:10,760
No.

3107
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,060
The sun's coming off.

3108
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,040
I think it's too late.

3109
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:15,340
What's new with you?

3110
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:17,560
Ran into some goblins in the wood.

3111
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:19,900
Aw, man.

3112
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:23,240
Yeah.

3113
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:27,120
Um...

3114
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,500
You know, I'm just gonna wait.

3115
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:44,370
I wanna get out of my bounty.

3116
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:45,570
Ba-bum.

3117
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:47,670
Ba-ba-ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-dam.

3118
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:56,190
I was over... I... I... Dang it, I was... I need one more.

3119
02:30:56,350 --> 02:30:57,050
One more hour.

3120
02:31:00,010 --> 02:31:01,370
Okay, he'll appear.

3121
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:04,650
I... I think I heard him.

3122
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:07,970
Good night.

3123
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:10,170
Good night, puny.

3124
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:16,400
I like how this is an abandoned track, but it's not really.

3125
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:19,140
How are you?

3126
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,540
There he is.

3127
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:22,660
Good to see you again.

3128
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:23,100
Hello.

3129
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:27,100
Um, can you pay off my fines and my bounties?

3130
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:32,220
You can pay your fines to the guards, serve your time, or pay me half.

3131
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:34,040
Pay me half.

3132
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:38,500
Um, I'll pay off my fines.

3133
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:40,060
Consider it done.

3134
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:43,020
I will get rid of all your criminal warrants.

3135
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:43,540
Yay!

3136
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:45,780
20 gold.

3137
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:49,800
Now I'm no longer a criminal scum.

3138
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:52,280
I mean, just a little bit, but...

3139
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:52,840
Rumors.

3140
02:31:53,020 --> 02:31:55,820
If you need something enchanted, Calendil has the goods.

3141
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:57,340
Okay.

3142
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:58,040
Thank you.

3143
02:31:58,540 --> 02:31:59,540
Shadow hide you.

3144
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:00,600
Shadow hide me.

3145
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,860
I see you're a follower of the Gray Fox, too.

3146
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:07,700
Yeah?

3147
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:09,680
Hot dog.

3148
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:13,040
All right, I'm actually gonna...

3149
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:15,360
Jump here.

3150
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:17,600
Shadow.

3151
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:18,400
Hachu!

3152
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,860
Oh my gosh, I haven't had Hachu in so long.

3153
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:21,940
Actually, I don't...

3154
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:23,140
Have you guys ever had Hachu?

3155
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:25,280
They're like a...

3156
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:25,980
They're like a...

3157
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:27,140
Not a gummy candy.

3158
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:28,760
I don't even know what it is.

3159
02:32:29,300 --> 02:32:29,780
But...

3160
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:31,200
There's another one.

3161
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:33,560
There's another candy that I actually prefer.

3162
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:38,440
It's very similar to Hachu, but it's got little balls of gummy in it.

3163
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:39,420
It's so yummy.

3164
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:41,620
Yeah, it's like a starburst.

3165
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:42,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3166
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:45,320
Oh, wow.

3167
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,200
The red arrow ends here.

3168
02:32:47,660 --> 02:32:49,940
So we really gotta go find Falien.

3169
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,800
If I were a high elf, where would I go?

3170
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:58,940
A fighting chance.

3171
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:01,440
The merchant's end, maybe here?

3172
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:06,330
Like a Gushers?

3173
02:33:06,550 --> 02:33:06,830
No!

3174
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:10,650
It's not...

3175
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:12,230
Yeah, the Puchao!

3176
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:12,990
Puchao!

3177
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:13,690
Puchao!

3178
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:15,690
Those are the ones that have...

3179
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:16,590
They have little...

3180
02:33:16,590 --> 02:33:19,310
Little balls of gummy in it.

3181
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:20,330
It's so yummy.

3182
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:22,170
That's the Puchao.

3183
02:33:22,430 --> 02:33:23,010
I like it.

3184
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:24,050
It's like Hachu.

3185
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:26,190
But it's not...

3186
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:27,610
It's not Starburst...

3187
02:33:27,610 --> 02:33:28,150
Or not Starburst...

3188
02:33:28,150 --> 02:33:30,090
Not Gushers because it's not like...

3189
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:31,090
Like a liquid.

3190
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:31,770
They're still...

3191
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:32,450
They're gummy gummy.

3192
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:34,130
Evening.

3193
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:34,990
Evening.

3194
02:33:36,470 --> 02:33:38,130
Are there any high elves here?

3195
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:39,310
Go ahead, please.

3196
02:33:41,590 --> 02:33:43,730
Hey, you're the one they call...

3197
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:45,070
The Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?

3198
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:47,710
The one that closed the Oblivion Gate...

3199
02:33:47,710 --> 02:33:49,210
And saved the city.

3200
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:51,190
They're so yummy, though.

3201
02:33:51,190 --> 02:33:51,630
Farewell.

3202
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:53,950
My...

3203
02:33:54,650 --> 02:33:55,250
Um...

3204
02:33:55,250 --> 02:33:55,890
Friend...

3205
02:33:56,830 --> 02:33:57,430
From...

3206
02:33:57,430 --> 02:33:58,950
The UK...

3207
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:01,210
She recently gave me some...

3208
02:34:01,810 --> 02:34:02,330
Some...

3209
02:34:02,330 --> 02:34:02,830
Candies.

3210
02:34:03,170 --> 02:34:04,950
Some of them were Werther's Originals.

3211
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:05,810
Which I...

3212
02:34:05,810 --> 02:34:06,290
You know what?

3213
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:08,370
I don't care if it's Grandma Candy.

3214
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:09,830
Werther's Originals?

3215
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:10,510
Those...

3216
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:11,030
Oh...

3217
02:34:11,030 --> 02:34:13,070
Those are so delicious.

3218
02:34:13,870 --> 02:34:15,130
Oh my god.

3219
02:34:15,650 --> 02:34:16,930
But then she also gave me something...

3220
02:34:18,650 --> 02:34:19,750
What was it called?

3221
02:34:19,970 --> 02:34:21,910
Why is this one the only one that's...

3222
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:29,290
They're so good.

3223
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:31,430
There was one that was like chocolate...

3224
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:33,510
With a little froggy mascot.

3225
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:35,910
It's like called...

3226
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:37,310
Freddy...

3227
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:37,950
Or...

3228
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:38,310
Frog...

3229
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:39,190
Froggo...

3230
02:34:40,350 --> 02:34:40,870
Or...

3231
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:41,810
Freddo!

3232
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:43,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3233
02:34:44,270 --> 02:34:45,630
Oh, you're not our guy.

3234
02:34:47,670 --> 02:34:48,570
What's the note?

3235
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:50,630
Go to the end of the street.

3236
02:34:50,790 --> 02:34:51,290
Turn left.

3237
02:34:51,570 --> 02:34:52,550
Take the next right.

3238
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:54,130
If you see the house with the fallen roof...

3239
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:54,750
You've gone too far.

3240
02:34:54,850 --> 02:34:55,270
Knock twice.

3241
02:34:55,410 --> 02:34:55,730
Pause again.

3242
02:34:55,790 --> 02:34:56,210
Knock again.

3243
02:34:56,370 --> 02:34:57,170
They'll let you in.

3244
02:34:57,310 --> 02:34:58,430
Be sure to have the money.

3245
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:08,630
Freddos are used by the UK...

3246
02:35:08,630 --> 02:35:10,230
As an official economic index.

3247
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:12,550
Freddos!

3248
02:35:12,690 --> 02:35:13,490
Yeah, that was pretty yummy.

3249
02:35:15,470 --> 02:35:17,710
How do I screenshot in...

3250
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:18,270
Steam?

3251
02:35:20,610 --> 02:35:21,290
Like F11?

3252
02:35:24,270 --> 02:35:24,610
F12?

3253
02:35:26,050 --> 02:35:26,630
There we go.

3254
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:27,150
Oh god.

3255
02:35:29,710 --> 02:35:32,250
I was heartbroken when you rejected me.

3256
02:35:32,650 --> 02:35:34,950
Tell me what I can do to win your heart.

3257
02:35:35,210 --> 02:35:36,590
I will slay trolls.

3258
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:38,150
Walk through thorns.

3259
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:39,270
Fast for a week.

3260
02:35:39,570 --> 02:35:41,350
Please don't shut me out of your life.

3261
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:44,330
I love you more than a flower needs sunshine.

3262
02:35:45,630 --> 02:35:47,250
Your penitent lover.

3263
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:55,540
The copious coin purse has goods from beyond the shores of Anvil.

3264
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:58,960
All manner of exotic items are available on our shelves.

3265
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:01,480
We have the widest inventory in the city.

3266
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:04,840
Freddo frogs are like the Australia chocolate.

3267
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:08,760
Australia?

3268
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:09,080
Australia?

3269
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,180
Pickpocket!

3270
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,300
Pickpocket!

3271
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:17,660
Guard your purses!

3272
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:26,670
Good night!

3273
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:29,090
Atencion!

3274
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:31,710
Atencion, pickpocket!

3275
02:36:32,270 --> 02:36:34,010
Atencion, pickpocket!

3276
02:36:34,010 --> 02:36:34,050
Hey!

3277
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:37,790
Uh-oh.

3278
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:39,830
It's all over, Lawbreaker.

3279
02:36:40,170 --> 02:36:41,970
Your spree is at an end.

3280
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:43,990
I'll take any stolen goods you...

3281
02:36:43,990 --> 02:36:45,230
How did he know?

3282
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:47,810
Then pay with your...

3283
02:36:47,810 --> 02:36:49,150
Uh, wait.

3284
02:36:49,810 --> 02:36:50,570
There we go.

3285
02:36:50,830 --> 02:36:51,890
How did he know?

3286
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:02,680
Oh my god!

3287
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:05,580
No wonder he went back to sleep.

3288
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:08,620
He was like, yeah, that'll get him.

3289
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:12,140
That'll get their attention.

3290
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:13,800
What the hell?

3291
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:17,100
Attention on pickpocket!

3292
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:23,800
If only my mom were so lucky.

3293
02:37:29,150 --> 02:37:30,250
One day.

3294
02:37:31,150 --> 02:37:32,810
One day in the city.

3295
02:37:33,490 --> 02:37:34,850
The main ingredient.

3296
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:35,390
Okay.

3297
02:37:36,210 --> 02:37:37,730
We're just gonna keep looking around.

3298
02:37:47,440 --> 02:37:49,860
We're looking for Ophelion.

3299
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:54,320
Oh, are you Phelion?

3300
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:56,720
Please say yes.

3301
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:57,720
Carwen!

3302
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:00,860
You wear the shadows well, fellow thief.

3303
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:01,980
Oh!

3304
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:02,760
Phelion!

3305
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:03,720
Phelion.

3306
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:04,960
Yes, I know who he is.

3307
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:08,500
But I'm really not in the habit of discussing such things with strangers.

3308
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:10,340
Oh, you wanna bribe?

3309
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:13,640
But pay off my fines about it.

3310
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:15,500
I don't have any rumors.

3311
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:19,660
Vanivia Melisaia takes all the merchant complaints in the city.

3312
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:21,440
Okay, hold on.

3313
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:22,720
All right.

3314
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,860
Oh, that's not bad.

3315
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:24,400
That's not bad.

3316
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:25,060
That's not bad.

3317
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:27,140
32.

3318
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,260
Goodness gracious.

3319
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:28,540
Okay.

3320
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,620
I remember how to do this, I think.

3321
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:35,540
Uh...

3322
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:36,600
What nonsense!

3323
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:39,780
What a dumb joke!

3324
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:41,700
Wait, yeah.

3325
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,000
Really like this one.

3326
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:43,860
This one's okay.

3327
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:44,900
Well done.

3328
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:46,500
Yes, yes!

3329
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:47,680
Whatever you say!

3330
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:48,700
Okay, okay, okay!

3331
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,240
What a dumb joke.

3332
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:54,000
Uh, this.

3333
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:55,220
Sorry.

3334
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:55,480
Sorry.

3335
02:38:55,540 --> 02:38:56,500
I don't get it.

3336
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:57,400
Oh, shoot.

3337
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:58,200
I think I messed up.

3338
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:01,000
What a great...

3339
02:39:02,060 --> 02:39:02,500
Not...

3340
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:03,240
Yes, yes!

3341
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:03,700
Oh!

3342
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:04,280
Whatever you say!

3343
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:05,780
It went up, it went up, it went up.

3344
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:08,580
Um...

3345
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,360
Uh...

3346
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:11,920
What nonsense!

3347
02:39:12,380 --> 02:39:12,820
Don't.

3348
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:13,260
Please.

3349
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:14,060
I'm sorry.

3350
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:15,160
Well done.

3351
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:16,240
Sorry.

3352
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:17,480
I don't get it.

3353
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:19,660
Okay, 65.

3354
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,360
I think, what, we need to get to 70?

3355
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:23,880
Uh...

3356
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:26,340
You think that's funny?

3357
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:26,940
Oh, shoot.

3358
02:39:27,020 --> 02:39:27,640
I think I messed up.

3359
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:29,320
Why am I so bad at this?

3360
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:29,680
Well done.

3361
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:32,400
Yes, yes!

3362
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:34,600
Don't try to manipulate me!

3363
02:39:36,420 --> 02:39:36,940
Ah...

3364
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:38,420
Oh, no!

3365
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:40,460
I can't do anymore.

3366
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:43,660
I messed up.

3367
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:47,420
I'm gonna have to buy this.

3368
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:49,720
For me?

3369
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:52,120
You shouldn't have.

3370
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,480
I'm with you.

3371
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:54,300
Completely.

3372
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:54,840
Oh!

3373
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:55,900
They like me now.

3374
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:57,400
Falion.

3375
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,520
Falion, you say?

3376
02:39:58,940 --> 02:39:59,500
Yes, yes, yes.

3377
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:00,400
Well, yes, I know who he is.

3378
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:02,240
Rather distasteful fellow, actually.

3379
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:02,900
Oh, good.

3380
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:03,440
I'll kill him.

3381
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:06,260
I believe he lives at the Tiber Septim Hotel.

3382
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:10,500
That's in the Talos Plaza District here in the Imperial City.

3383
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:12,800
I'd ask around there if I were you.

3384
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:13,380
Nice!

3385
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:15,320
Hi!

3386
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:16,080
Thank you!

3387
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:18,940
Shadow hide you!

3388
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:19,880
Shadow hide you!

3389
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:19,920
Shadow hide you!

3390
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,460
Alright, nice.

3391
02:40:24,820 --> 02:40:26,020
Good info, good info.

3392
02:40:28,780 --> 02:40:30,520
I have nothing to say to you.

3393
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:32,760
Shadow hide you.

3394
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:39,660
Here?

3395
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:42,060
Nope.

3396
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:46,880
I think we gotta go to another district.

3397
02:40:49,970 --> 02:40:50,830
Run, run, run.

3398
02:40:51,850 --> 02:40:52,290
Uh...

3399
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:55,430
I'm trying...

3400
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:56,050
Yes.

3401
02:40:59,230 --> 02:41:01,250
Maybe that's why they put you there.

3402
02:41:01,410 --> 02:41:02,510
So that you can talk to that person.

3403
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:04,930
Sounds like you played Assassin's Creed too, Meantle.

3404
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:07,530
I haven't...

3405
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,690
Never, not even once.

3406
02:41:10,910 --> 02:41:12,150
Let's go, my athletics.

3407
02:41:12,650 --> 02:41:13,810
Let's go, my athletics.

3408
02:41:15,890 --> 02:41:16,410
Here.

3409
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:17,830
Wait, what time is it?

3410
02:41:18,650 --> 02:41:19,910
2 a.m.?

3411
02:41:19,910 --> 02:41:21,590
We might be able to kill him in his sleep.

3412
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:28,260
Hello.

3413
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:31,400
Welcome, friend, to the Tiber Septim Hotel.

3414
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:35,100
I am Augusta Alidia, your hostess.

3415
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:36,320
Wow, she's so friendly.

3416
02:41:36,740 --> 02:41:37,740
Should I talk about Falien?

3417
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:40,500
Yes, I know who Falien is.

3418
02:41:40,780 --> 02:41:42,760
Know quite a bit about him, actually.

3419
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:44,920
But I probably shouldn't gossip.

3420
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:46,900
I mean, we hardly know each other.

3421
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:52,840
Not yet, Augusta.

3422
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:55,680
If I can call you that.

3423
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:57,660
We'll see.

3424
02:41:58,260 --> 02:41:59,420
Oh, we'll see.

3425
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:03,720
Guys, I have to... I have to go to the little ghostie's room real quick.

3426
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:07,360
One moment.

3427
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:10,060
Give me a second.

3428
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:11,820
Let's go.

3429
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:13,820
To the little ghostie's room.

3430
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,080
We are B.

3431
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,480
I'm back.

3432
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:51,420
I'm back.

3433
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:51,940
I'm back.

3434
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:53,800
Uh, did I?

3435
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:54,820
Sorry about that.

3436
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,820
Thank you for all the super-duty guys.

3437
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:00,020
Thank you.

3438
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:02,960
Thank you for the gifted.

3439
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:04,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3440
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:05,080
All right, let's...

3441
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,180
This one is tough, you guys.

3442
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:08,180
This one's pretty tough.

3443
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:09,780
She's only at 40.

3444
02:45:10,460 --> 02:45:11,700
She looks like...

3445
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:12,420
Didn't she...

3446
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,140
Wasn't she smiling before I left?

3447
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:16,180
Let's see.

3448
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,620
She hates to be admired.

3449
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:20,760
Let's do...

3450
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:21,740
Colors.

3451
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,000
Whatever you want.

3452
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:25,580
This one she didn't like.

3453
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:26,000
Yeah.

3454
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,380
Don't talk such rot.

3455
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:29,040
Don't talk such rot.

3456
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:31,060
This one...

3457
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:31,500
I doubt it.

3458
02:45:32,340 --> 02:45:33,940
Then this one she was okay.

3459
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:34,880
That's pretty good.

3460
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:36,520
Okay, here we go.

3461
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:36,980
51.

3462
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:37,680
Nice.

3463
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:39,180
Save first.

3464
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:39,900
That's right.

3465
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:40,380
Exactly.

3466
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:42,140
That's...

3467
02:45:42,140 --> 02:45:43,160
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

3468
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:43,600
You too.

3469
02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:48,090
That's pretty good.

3470
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:48,790
What can I do for you?

3471
02:45:49,230 --> 02:45:52,290
Vorn, welcome to membership.goo.

3472
02:45:52,350 --> 02:45:53,110
Uh, let's...

3473
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:53,590
I'm listening.

3474
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,830
Yes, yes, yes.

3475
02:45:55,350 --> 02:45:55,810
Yes.

3476
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:57,830
Oh, this is really bad luck.

3477
02:45:57,970 --> 02:45:58,110
Okay.

3478
02:45:58,710 --> 02:45:59,650
I doubt it.

3479
02:45:59,850 --> 02:46:01,250
Oh, this is really bad luck.

3480
02:46:01,470 --> 02:46:01,710
Oh.

3481
02:46:01,970 --> 02:46:02,490
Good one.

3482
02:46:02,890 --> 02:46:03,370
Oh.

3483
02:46:04,350 --> 02:46:04,670
Uh.

3484
02:46:05,710 --> 02:46:06,290
No more.

3485
02:46:06,470 --> 02:46:06,750
You're...

3486
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:07,710
Don't talk such rot.

3487
02:46:07,890 --> 02:46:11,330
Oh, I think we just upgraded, though.

3488
02:46:12,330 --> 02:46:13,430
That one wasn't great.

3489
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:16,170
That one was not great.

3490
02:46:17,070 --> 02:46:19,110
Not now, not later, not ever.

3491
02:46:19,270 --> 02:46:19,930
I accept.

3492
02:46:20,130 --> 02:46:21,010
I have no choice.

3493
02:46:22,150 --> 02:46:22,990
Not bad.

3494
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:23,730
Not bad at...

3495
02:46:23,730 --> 02:46:24,350
I doubt it.

3496
02:46:24,810 --> 02:46:26,670
Ah, I think I went down.

3497
02:46:28,910 --> 02:46:29,830
Oh, gosh.

3498
02:46:30,730 --> 02:46:31,470
I doubt it.

3499
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:36,030
Wait.

3500
02:46:36,370 --> 02:46:38,170
Don't waste your flattery on me.

3501
02:46:38,370 --> 02:46:38,870
Oh.

3502
02:46:43,090 --> 02:46:43,870
No more.

3503
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:44,570
Not bad.

3504
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:45,510
Not bad at all.

3505
02:46:45,850 --> 02:46:46,450
Ah.

3506
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:54,890
Hey.

3507
02:46:57,710 --> 02:46:58,310
Hard.

3508
02:46:59,030 --> 02:47:00,490
This is so hard.

3509
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:07,200
And now it's only...

3510
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:09,740
I think it was plus 10 disposition before, wasn't it?

3511
02:47:09,940 --> 02:47:11,180
34 gold.

3512
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:13,240
She's a tough crowd.

3513
02:47:15,460 --> 02:47:17,300
Could temp drop the scales.

3514
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:18,240
That works for me.

3515
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:20,380
Let's see if she does it now.

3516
02:47:20,380 --> 02:47:21,620
Oh, I know him.

3517
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:22,420
Oh.

3518
02:47:22,420 --> 02:47:23,580
A waste of life, that one.

3519
02:47:23,740 --> 02:47:23,900
Oh.

3520
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:26,520
He lives here, you know, with his sweetheart, a trainer.

3521
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:27,380
A trainer.

3522
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,420
What that poor girl sees in him, I'll never know.

3523
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:32,760
A trainer pays for their room, their food, everything.

3524
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:34,820
She's quite wealthy, I believe.

3525
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:37,000
Falien used to have money.

3526
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:39,040
Used to be quite a gentleman, too.

3527
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,200
But that was before he took a fancy to the...

3528
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:44,280
You know, the skooma.

3529
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:45,980
Oh, the skooma.

3530
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:50,940
He's not using skooma or wandering the city looking for some, I imagine.

3531
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:53,480
He comes back every night to be with a trainer.

3532
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:55,900
But only for a few hours, I swear.

3533
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:59,580
That high elf is going to wind up dead if he keeps living like this.

3534
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:02,200
Oh my god, she spilled the tea so easily.

3535
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:03,800
Holy cow.

3536
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:07,340
She was like...

3537
02:48:07,880 --> 02:48:11,740
At first she was like, oh yes, I know a little about Falien.

3538
02:48:11,940 --> 02:48:13,460
Oh yes, he's quite the fellow.

3539
02:48:13,460 --> 02:48:18,860
And then as soon as you get her, her, her, her, uh...

3540
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,440
Um...

3541
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:21,940
Oh, uh...

3542
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:23,660
I keep wanting to say personality.

3543
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:27,320
Her, um, friendship up.

3544
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:30,240
She's just like, that, that love life.

3545
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:30,980
Good day.

3546
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:34,240
Good day to you, Augusta.

3547
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:35,160
What the?

3548
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,360
Was this guy always here?

3549
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:39,740
Breaking it down?

3550
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,320
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

3551
02:48:43,460 --> 02:48:52,840
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,

3552
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:53,520
oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,

3553
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:58,820
oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,

3554
02:49:09,580 --> 02:49:13,760
oops, oops So is he here?

3555
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:23,480
Why was he breaking it down like that?

3556
02:49:26,930 --> 02:49:28,710
Or is he...

3557
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:34,420
We have...

3558
02:49:34,420 --> 02:49:36,060
A poltergeist.

3559
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:38,940
I believe.

3560
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,300
What's up here?

3561
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:45,800
The study...

3562
02:49:45,800 --> 02:49:46,460
What?

3563
02:49:49,900 --> 02:49:52,600
You wouldn't find Faily in here, that's for sure.

3564
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:58,330
Okay.

3565
02:50:19,130 --> 02:50:20,690
It's the birds and the bees.

3566
02:50:21,570 --> 02:50:22,550
Oh, he's finished.

3567
02:50:22,890 --> 02:50:23,530
That was fast.

3568
02:50:25,570 --> 02:50:27,470
Okay, let's try one of these doors.

3569
02:50:27,670 --> 02:50:28,890
I just want to see what he looks like.

3570
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:29,650
Wait, what time is it?

3571
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:30,850
Okay, it's 3am.

3572
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:46,520
Got it.

3573
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:48,780
Faily...

3574
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:49,380
Oh...

3575
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:51,120
Nobody's here.

3576
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:54,260
Faily in!

3577
02:50:56,390 --> 02:50:58,060
I'm also a...

3578
02:50:58,060 --> 02:50:59,180
Faily in!

3579
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:00,620
Oh, whoops.

3580
02:51:02,660 --> 02:51:03,320
Itina!

3581
02:51:06,730 --> 02:51:08,220
Itina can maybe relate.

3582
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:08,340
Wait.

3583
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:13,660
What?

3584
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:15,020
Why is there nobody here either?

3585
02:51:15,620 --> 02:51:16,140
Okay.

3586
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:19,280
I thought these rooms were rented.

3587
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:20,220
That's why...

3588
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:21,260
Oh!

3589
02:51:22,540 --> 02:51:23,620
That's his girl!

3590
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:25,700
You think I can talk to her?

3591
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,340
Good morning.

3592
02:51:31,660 --> 02:51:32,720
Yes, my lady.

3593
02:51:33,260 --> 02:51:34,560
How may I help you?

3594
02:51:34,820 --> 02:51:35,720
Where's your man?

3595
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:37,240
Faily in?

3596
02:51:38,480 --> 02:51:39,000
He...

3597
02:51:39,620 --> 02:51:40,840
He's my sweet.

3598
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:42,580
My true love.

3599
02:51:43,460 --> 02:51:43,980
But...

3600
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:45,880
I don't know why I'm telling this to you.

3601
02:51:46,100 --> 02:51:46,720
I mean...

3602
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:48,680
We hardly know each other and all...

3603
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,280
You want me to kill him?

3604
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:50,600
You want me to kill him?

3605
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:51,720
I'm listening.

3606
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:52,480
Oh no.

3607
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:54,100
She's even tougher than the...

3608
02:51:54,100 --> 02:51:55,160
Than the other lady.

3609
02:51:57,140 --> 02:51:58,500
Faelian needs some sleep.

3610
02:51:58,800 --> 02:51:59,320
Or...

3611
02:51:59,320 --> 02:52:00,120
Whatever her name is.

3612
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:00,440
I'll...

3613
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:01,140
I'll...

3614
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:03,160
Let's see.

3615
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:09,090
Really now?

3616
02:52:09,090 --> 02:52:10,510
You're such a charmer.

3617
02:52:13,870 --> 02:52:14,670
That's cute.

3618
02:52:14,910 --> 02:52:16,190
You think I'm afraid of you?

3619
02:52:16,350 --> 02:52:17,050
I doubt it.

3620
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:18,130
That's pretty good.

3621
02:52:18,290 --> 02:52:18,470
Okay.

3622
02:52:18,850 --> 02:52:19,890
I got some more.

3623
02:52:20,030 --> 02:52:20,170
Okay.

3624
02:52:21,410 --> 02:52:22,410
Says at the bottom.

3625
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:22,990
Oh!

3626
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:24,430
Adrena!

3627
02:52:24,590 --> 02:52:25,110
Adrena!

3628
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:25,750
Adrena!

3629
02:52:29,850 --> 02:52:30,370
Ooh!

3630
02:52:31,630 --> 02:52:33,450
What a wonderful compliment.

3631
02:52:34,850 --> 02:52:35,630
Good one.

3632
02:52:36,030 --> 02:52:36,290
Oh!

3633
02:52:36,810 --> 02:52:37,510
I messed up.

3634
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:38,970
I doubt.

3635
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:40,250
Don't make me laugh.

3636
02:52:40,570 --> 02:52:40,710
Ooh!

3637
02:52:40,870 --> 02:52:41,430
I messed up.

3638
02:52:44,910 --> 02:52:45,690
Talk tough.

3639
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:46,210
There we go.

3640
02:52:46,290 --> 02:52:46,610
There we go.

3641
02:52:46,610 --> 02:52:47,350
There we go.

3642
02:52:47,630 --> 02:52:48,550
That's pretty good.

3643
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:49,130
I doubt.

3644
02:52:49,290 --> 02:52:49,630
Okay.

3645
02:52:50,130 --> 02:52:50,430
Okay.

3646
02:52:50,590 --> 02:52:50,810
Okay.

3647
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:51,210
Okay.

3648
02:52:51,490 --> 02:52:51,590
Okay.

3649
02:52:54,190 --> 02:52:55,570
Can't do better than that.

3650
02:52:55,970 --> 02:52:56,450
Let's see.

3651
02:52:56,590 --> 02:52:58,290
Let's see if she'll now talk about him.

3652
02:52:58,290 --> 02:52:58,950
Please.

3653
02:52:59,270 --> 02:52:59,530
I...

3654
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:02,810
I don't mean to get emotional, but...

3655
02:53:02,810 --> 02:53:04,710
I feel I can trust you.

3656
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:05,890
Yeah, you can.

3657
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:08,070
I just don't know what to do about Falien.

3658
02:53:09,230 --> 02:53:10,270
He's Falien.

3659
02:53:10,270 --> 02:53:12,750
All he cares about is Skuma.

3660
02:53:12,910 --> 02:53:13,370
What?

3661
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:15,570
He was a fine young man once.

3662
02:53:15,850 --> 02:53:17,550
But he's lost everything.

3663
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:20,550
His looks, his money, his self-respect.

3664
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:22,070
All he cares about is Skuma.

3665
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:24,530
I followed him a few times to see where he goes.

3666
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:28,110
He walks around the city looking for Skuma.

3667
02:53:28,110 --> 02:53:31,850
And then he goes to Lorkmere's house for several hours.

3668
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:32,190
Oh?

3669
02:53:32,970 --> 02:53:35,310
It's in the Elfin Gardens district.

3670
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:37,510
I think the house is deserted.

3671
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:38,850
That's why he goes there.

3672
02:53:39,050 --> 02:53:41,870
So he can escape from life and do his Skuma.

3673
02:53:42,470 --> 02:53:43,770
Thank you for listening.

3674
02:53:44,490 --> 02:53:45,730
You're a good friend.

3675
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:50,250
I just hope my sweet Falien can clean himself up.

3676
02:53:50,250 --> 02:53:52,830
Or that awful Skuma will be the death of him.

3677
02:53:52,850 --> 02:53:55,010
That's where he goes to do his Skuma.

3678
02:53:55,750 --> 02:53:56,250
I can't...

3679
02:53:57,010 --> 02:53:59,190
They couldn't have chosen a different name.

3680
02:54:01,870 --> 02:54:02,870
Goodness gracious.

3681
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:16,180
Oh great.

3682
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:18,200
I hope we don't catch him in the act.

3683
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:20,360
Okay, let's go...

3684
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:22,820
To where he is...

3685
02:54:22,820 --> 02:54:23,840
I guess...

3686
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:25,820
The Elfin Gardens district.

3687
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:27,540
You have my ear.

3688
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:33,160
Despite the patch, we are still getting some incredible jank this street.

3689
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:34,360
For real?

3690
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:35,780
What's happening?

3691
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:43,120
Oi.

3692
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:46,540
Here?

3693
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:47,060
Here?

3694
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:48,400
No, no.

3695
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:51,000
Here?

3696
02:54:51,320 --> 02:54:52,200
No, no, no.

3697
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:53,320
This place is occupied.

3698
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:53,600
Speak.

3699
02:54:53,880 --> 02:54:54,340
Speak.

3700
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:03,480
I'm so bad at following the arrow.

3701
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:07,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3702
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:09,000
Oof.

3703
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:12,220
Nope.

3704
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:14,200
Here.

3705
02:55:27,870 --> 02:55:29,110
Haha, easy.

3706
02:55:30,510 --> 02:55:33,370
This game truly makes a lot of clippable moments.

3707
02:55:38,470 --> 02:55:40,470
Do you think he's doing the Skuma?

3708
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:42,410
Is he in the basement?

3709
02:55:42,750 --> 02:55:43,870
No, maybe he's upstairs?

3710
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:48,330
Who's Lorkmare?

3711
02:55:48,730 --> 02:55:48,810
Who's Lorkmare?

3712
02:55:54,670 --> 02:55:55,970
Wait, he's not here.

3713
02:56:03,010 --> 02:56:04,630
Oh, I thought that was a coin.

3714
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:11,180
Um...

3715
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:13,020
He's doing Skuma in the basement.

3716
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:15,680
Okay.

3717
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:30,360
Oh!

3718
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:31,380
Oh!

3719
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:37,900
That's not him!

3720
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:46,860
Uh...

3721
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:48,340
I came across a crime!

3722
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:55,020
Oh, shoot!

3723
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:03,320
Oh, come on!

3724
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:04,020
Seriously?

3725
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:06,020
What a waste.

3726
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:07,760
Oh, wait.

3727
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:08,320
It said it was empty.

3728
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:08,720
Am I bad?

3729
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:14,020
I guess it's already been...

3730
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:15,600
Looted.

3731
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:21,240
Um...

3732
02:57:21,240 --> 02:57:23,760
Is nobody gonna report this?

3733
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:26,960
Okay.

3734
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,120
Uh...

3735
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:30,300
Well, he's not here.

3736
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:32,360
Big ol' watermelon.

3737
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:41,890
Okay, uh-huh.

3738
02:57:44,550 --> 02:57:47,190
Yeah, don't do Skuma, kids.

3739
02:57:49,350 --> 02:57:52,410
I thought he was just like, you know...

3740
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:54,390
I thought he was all...

3741
02:57:55,190 --> 02:57:55,670
S...

3742
02:57:55,670 --> 02:57:56,170
Scoomed out.

3743
02:57:56,370 --> 02:57:56,910
I don't know.

3744
02:57:58,830 --> 02:57:59,630
5 AM.

3745
02:57:59,630 --> 02:58:00,930
I was probably...

3746
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:01,570
Too late.

3747
02:58:08,350 --> 02:58:08,830
Um...

3748
02:58:09,330 --> 02:58:10,350
Maybe we can wait.

3749
02:58:11,310 --> 02:58:11,790
Nothing.

3750
02:58:12,510 --> 02:58:15,650
Maybe we, like, wait all day here for him to come over.

3751
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:18,410
But it's probably gotta be in the middle of the night, no?

3752
02:58:25,340 --> 02:58:25,820
Hmm...

3753
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:30,540
Wait inside, maybe?

3754
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:34,580
Yeah, let's...

3755
02:58:34,580 --> 02:58:36,240
Because it said that he...

3756
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:41,550
It said that...

3757
02:58:41,550 --> 02:58:44,010
Well, she said that he goes...

3758
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:48,210
To her at night, his girlfriend, and then leaves in the middle of the night.

3759
02:58:53,930 --> 02:58:55,170
Didn't she say what time?

3760
02:58:55,250 --> 02:58:56,310
I don't think it was specific.

3761
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:06,540
Maybe I...

3762
02:59:06,540 --> 02:59:07,720
Just wait...

3763
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:11,540
Six hours?

3764
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:12,620
That's it?

3765
02:59:13,360 --> 02:59:15,340
Okay, that's what you said.

3766
02:59:31,590 --> 02:59:32,830
Hey, whoa!

3767
02:59:33,310 --> 02:59:35,630
You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!

3768
02:59:36,610 --> 02:59:38,210
Hey, hey!

3769
02:59:38,610 --> 02:59:39,330
How...

3770
02:59:39,330 --> 02:59:40,410
What are...

3771
02:59:40,410 --> 02:59:42,130
What are you...

3772
02:59:42,130 --> 02:59:43,390
Doing here?

3773
02:59:44,130 --> 02:59:45,350
You're not my...

3774
02:59:45,350 --> 02:59:46,850
Not my friend?

3775
02:59:47,350 --> 02:59:47,850
What?

3776
02:59:47,850 --> 02:59:49,050
You know...

3777
02:59:49,050 --> 02:59:49,290
What...

3778
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:49,590
What...

3779
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:49,810
What...

3780
02:59:49,810 --> 02:59:50,850
Do you...

3781
02:59:50,850 --> 02:59:51,430
Want?

3782
02:59:52,270 --> 02:59:55,030
You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!

3783
02:59:58,310 --> 03:00:00,490
Maybe I should've waited for him to go to the basement.

3784
03:00:02,970 --> 03:00:03,510
Dude...

3785
03:00:03,510 --> 03:00:04,530
This is what hap...

3786
03:00:04,530 --> 03:00:06,810
This is what you look like when you're on Skuma!

3787
03:00:06,810 --> 03:00:07,170
Come on!

3788
03:00:07,450 --> 03:00:09,430
I want your soul, Falien!

3789
03:00:13,870 --> 03:00:15,410
It's time to sleep!

3790
03:00:15,770 --> 03:00:16,350
Sleep?

3791
03:00:17,270 --> 03:00:17,930
But...

3792
03:00:17,930 --> 03:00:18,690
Nah...

3793
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:19,150
No...

3794
03:00:19,150 --> 03:00:19,350
I...

3795
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:20,650
I'm not tired...

3796
03:00:20,650 --> 03:00:21,790
Not tired right now...

3797
03:00:21,790 --> 03:00:22,690
I have lots of...

3798
03:00:22,690 --> 03:00:23,110
You know...

3799
03:00:23,110 --> 03:00:23,890
Energy...

3800
03:00:23,890 --> 03:00:24,790
The Skuma...

3801
03:00:24,790 --> 03:00:25,490
I can feel it...

3802
03:00:25,490 --> 03:00:26,890
In my veins...

3803
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:28,170
Oh...

3804
03:00:29,450 --> 03:00:30,010
Okay...

3805
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:31,770
Oh, this is good actually...

3806
03:00:31,770 --> 03:00:32,050
Oh...

3807
03:00:32,050 --> 03:00:32,550
Take it...

3808
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:33,610
Come on, Falien...

3809
03:00:33,610 --> 03:00:34,390
Go downstairs...

3810
03:00:34,390 --> 03:00:35,190
Yep...

3811
03:00:35,190 --> 03:00:36,170
Go down...

3812
03:00:36,170 --> 03:00:36,390
No...

3813
03:00:36,390 --> 03:00:36,710
No...

3814
03:00:36,710 --> 03:00:38,390
Go downstairs...

3815
03:00:38,390 --> 03:00:38,930
Yep...

3816
03:00:38,930 --> 03:00:42,370
Go downstairs...

3817
03:00:42,370 --> 03:00:43,070
Falien!

3818
03:00:43,230 --> 03:00:43,530
Falien!

3819
03:00:43,690 --> 03:00:43,970
Falien!

3820
03:00:46,590 --> 03:00:48,470
I think I have to kill him, guys...

3821
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:54,120
I think I gotta kill him...

3822
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:16,310
Oh

3823
03:01:21,130 --> 03:01:21,510
shoot...

3824
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:22,490
I did it!

3825
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:23,630
Falien is dead...

3826
03:01:23,630 --> 03:01:25,150
I killed him in Lorkmare's house...

3827
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:26,490
A secure location with no witnesses...

3828
03:01:27,770 --> 03:01:29,990
I must now return to the Sanctuary and speak with Ochiva...

3829
03:01:29,990 --> 03:01:31,630
And receive my reward and bonus!

3830
03:01:32,250 --> 03:01:32,850
Yes...

3831
03:01:32,850 --> 03:01:34,830
Now that you have him alone...

3832
03:01:34,830 --> 03:01:37,350
Is it Falien Isolation?

3833
03:01:38,630 --> 03:01:40,650
Can we get Skuma or...

3834
03:01:42,950 --> 03:01:43,550
Oh...

3835
03:01:44,510 --> 03:01:45,110
Gold...

3836
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:46,630
Lorkmare's house key...

3837
03:01:46,630 --> 03:01:47,810
I don't think we need that...

3838
03:01:47,810 --> 03:01:48,090
I...

3839
03:01:48,090 --> 03:01:49,630
I can hit him in pretty easily...

3840
03:01:50,910 --> 03:01:51,510
Yeah...

3841
03:01:51,510 --> 03:01:53,830
Why is Tootie so freaking beefy?

3842
03:01:54,430 --> 03:01:55,910
Everybody else is...

3843
03:01:56,630 --> 03:01:57,990
Everyone else is like...

3844
03:01:57,990 --> 03:01:58,830
They just fall apart...

3845
03:02:01,630 --> 03:02:02,610
Wait, what is this?

3846
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:05,710
It's Skuma!

3847
03:02:10,090 --> 03:02:10,630
Oh...

3848
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:19,220
I could sell it...

3849
03:02:19,790 --> 03:02:21,980
It was actually worth a pretty good penny...

3850
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:24,600
Any more Skuma around here?

3851
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:25,060
I'm...

3852
03:02:25,060 --> 03:02:26,620
I'm itching for the Skuma!

3853
03:02:31,130 --> 03:02:31,970
Any more?

3854
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:33,250
Any more?

3855
03:02:33,550 --> 03:02:34,870
You got any of those...

3856
03:02:34,870 --> 03:02:35,550
I can't believe he...

3857
03:02:35,550 --> 03:02:37,210
He didn't even have it on his person...

3858
03:02:39,190 --> 03:02:41,350
He just leaves it here...

3859
03:02:41,350 --> 03:02:43,690
Anybody could take it...

3860
03:02:44,210 --> 03:02:46,270
He killed a man for the Skuma!

3861
03:02:46,590 --> 03:02:47,050
You know what?

3862
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:48,210
It's fine that we killed him...

3863
03:02:51,650 --> 03:02:52,650
Try some...

3864
03:02:52,650 --> 03:02:55,530
Hold on, I'll save...

3865
03:02:56,850 --> 03:02:57,850
And then...

3866
03:02:57,850 --> 03:02:59,210
We'll try it...

3867
03:03:03,310 --> 03:03:03,810
Skuma...

3868
03:03:03,810 --> 03:03:04,810
Drain...

3869
03:03:04,810 --> 03:03:05,810
Agility on self...

3870
03:03:05,810 --> 03:03:06,290
Damage...

3871
03:03:06,290 --> 03:03:07,550
Intelligence on self...

3872
03:03:07,550 --> 03:03:08,210
Fortify...

3873
03:03:08,210 --> 03:03:09,170
Strength on self...

3874
03:03:09,170 --> 03:03:09,650
Fortify...

3875
03:03:09,650 --> 03:03:10,750
Speed on self...

3876
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:12,730
For 20 seconds...

3877
03:03:12,730 --> 03:03:13,710
But our...

3878
03:03:13,710 --> 03:03:15,070
Intelligence is...

3879
03:03:15,070 --> 03:03:16,950
Forever damaged...

3880
03:03:19,810 --> 03:03:21,830
Does it make the screen all...

3881
03:03:21,830 --> 03:03:22,150
Like...

3882
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:22,570
Loopy?

3883
03:03:22,930 --> 03:03:25,130
That'd be fun...

3884
03:03:25,130 --> 03:03:26,330
Take all three!

3885
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:31,500
For a change...

3886
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:32,760
The last of the Daedra...

3887
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:33,620
Have been driven out...

3888
03:03:33,620 --> 03:03:34,180
Priestesses...

3889
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:36,140
Anyone looking for work...

3890
03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:37,780
Should consider the Fighters Guild...

3891
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:37,980
No!

3892
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:39,260
I hear they're always looking for...

3893
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:41,020
So I've heard...

3894
03:03:41,020 --> 03:03:42,660
Have you heard any word...

3895
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:43,440
About the other provinces?

3896
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:44,380
Don't be the last to read today!

3897
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:45,800
Black hole is Korea!

3898
03:03:47,540 --> 03:03:49,360
There is so much happening!

3899
03:03:51,700 --> 03:03:52,200
No!

3900
03:03:53,300 --> 03:03:54,840
Makes you quick but dumb...

3901
03:03:54,840 --> 03:03:57,020
Speedrunners drink tons of it to go fast...

3902
03:03:57,020 --> 03:03:57,700
No kidding!

3903
03:03:58,560 --> 03:03:59,540
That's crazy!

3904
03:03:59,820 --> 03:04:01,040
What does intelligence...

3905
03:04:02,760 --> 03:04:03,780
They didn't go in here...

3906
03:04:03,780 --> 03:04:04,020
Did they?

3907
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:08,080
What does intelligence have...

3908
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:09,840
What do we need it for anyway?

3909
03:04:14,130 --> 03:04:14,490
Gulp!

3910
03:04:14,630 --> 03:04:14,770
Gulp!

3911
03:04:14,970 --> 03:04:15,070
Gulp!

3912
03:04:15,230 --> 03:04:15,370
Gulp!

3913
03:04:15,510 --> 03:04:15,630
Gulp!

3914
03:04:15,630 --> 03:04:15,810
Gulp!

3915
03:04:16,330 --> 03:04:16,890
Gulp!

3916
03:04:18,430 --> 03:04:20,250
Gives you more magic on...

3917
03:04:20,250 --> 03:04:21,730
I see... I see...

3918
03:04:21,730 --> 03:04:22,490
Afternoon...

3919
03:04:22,490 --> 03:04:24,890
Have you ever spoken to Gryond Garana?

3920
03:04:25,590 --> 03:04:26,930
I find her annoying...

3921
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:30,150
I find her annoying...

3922
03:04:30,150 --> 03:04:30,450
I find her annoying...

3923
03:04:30,450 --> 03:04:30,930
I find her annoying...

3924
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:33,390
Oh wait, I forgot that we have...

3925
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:33,650
The...

3926
03:04:33,650 --> 03:04:34,710
The better key now...

3927
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:35,930
Hold on...

3928
03:04:40,390 --> 03:04:40,790
Oh...

3929
03:04:40,790 --> 03:04:43,330
Says a lot about speedrunners, doesn't it?

3930
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:46,050
How do you speedrun it?

3931
03:04:46,110 --> 03:04:46,790
Well, I guess...

3932
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:47,010
You know...

3933
03:04:47,010 --> 03:04:49,350
If you don't do all the side quests...

3934
03:04:49,350 --> 03:04:51,030
Just speedrunning a game like this...

3935
03:04:51,030 --> 03:04:51,930
Seems intense...

3936
03:04:55,330 --> 03:04:55,930
Oh...

3937
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:04,280
Achieveaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

3938
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:05,180
Goodbye...

3939
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:07,220
The High Elphalion now...

3940
03:05:07,220 --> 03:05:09,100
Swims in the maelstrom of darkness...

3941
03:05:09,100 --> 03:05:10,920
At the feet of our dreaded father...

3942
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:10,940
A hundred gold...

3943
03:05:10,940 --> 03:05:11,660
...Sythus...

3944
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:14,060
And there were no witnesses to your handy work...

3945
03:05:14,060 --> 03:05:14,580
The Skuma Sippers here...

3946
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:14,860
Hey!

3947
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:16,960
Because of the discretion you exercised...

3948
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:22,000
Captain Phyllida will not suspect the Dark Brotherhood was involved...

3949
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,960
And will not meddle in our affairs...

3950
03:05:24,680 --> 03:05:25,160
I think we...

3951
03:05:25,160 --> 03:05:26,720
I don't think that guy needed help...

3952
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:27,520
Here is your reward and bonus...

3953
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:28,080
To die...

3954
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,080
Both have been well earned...

3955
03:05:29,740 --> 03:05:31,000
Go now and rest...

3956
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:33,860
And may the Night Mother guard your dreams...

3957
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:36,880
Like, I think that guy could have just died on his own...

3958
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:37,820
Wait, what was my bonus?

3959
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:39,900
More money?

3960
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:42,860
Guys, we've barely made anything...

3961
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:48,860
We've barely made any money...

3962
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:53,340
Why is Tootie's Sexiest so beefy?

3963
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:59,520
I know you guys keep saying Thieves Guild...

3964
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:00,860
But these ones are so much more fun...

3965
03:06:01,740 --> 03:06:02,980
I like these quests...

3966
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:06,880
Oh, but...

3967
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:07,860
I can sell the Skuma...

3968
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:11,680
75...

3969
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:13,860
We have to sell that at the Thieves Guild, so...

3970
03:06:14,900 --> 03:06:15,220
Worth?

3971
03:06:15,800 --> 03:06:16,880
Time to sell drugs...

3972
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:18,740
What is this?

3973
03:06:18,820 --> 03:06:19,460
Schedule 1?

3974
03:06:25,740 --> 03:06:27,040
Oh yeah, I'll try it...

3975
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:27,820
I'll try it out first...

3976
03:06:33,400 --> 03:06:35,300
I like that we were just a detective...

3977
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:37,440
Okay, we save...

3978
03:06:37,440 --> 03:06:38,040
Wait, no...

3979
03:06:38,040 --> 03:06:38,840
No auto save...

3980
03:06:38,840 --> 03:06:39,300
Save...

3981
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:39,820
Quick save...

3982
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:40,640
There we go...

3983
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:43,460
Let's try it out...

3984
03:06:50,090 --> 03:06:52,130
Well, I don't even feel that much faster...

3985
03:06:54,230 --> 03:06:55,490
How can I help you?

3986
03:06:56,270 --> 03:06:57,310
Okay, never mind...

3987
03:06:57,310 --> 03:06:58,130
Maybe I do feel faster...

3988
03:06:59,570 --> 03:07:00,030
Oh...

3989
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:01,330
Have mercy...

3990
03:07:01,330 --> 03:07:03,130
Just one coin...

3991
03:07:04,630 --> 03:07:06,670
I'm so fast...

3992
03:07:07,370 --> 03:07:08,170
What?

3993
03:07:09,650 --> 03:07:11,450
Oh, I think it's over...

3994
03:07:12,230 --> 03:07:13,250
Hello...

3995
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:18,130
I experienced the Skuma...

3996
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:25,130
Yeah, we were hallucinating people in the bushes...

3997
03:07:27,190 --> 03:07:27,670
Cool...

3998
03:07:27,670 --> 03:07:27,770
Cool...

3999
03:07:27,770 --> 03:07:29,050
Now that's...

4000
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:31,290
I feel like this entire stream...

4001
03:07:31,290 --> 03:07:32,150
We've just been going to...

4002
03:07:33,090 --> 03:07:33,570
Uh...

4003
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:35,170
To...

4004
03:07:35,170 --> 03:07:36,190
Caden Hall...

4005
03:07:36,190 --> 03:07:37,190
Caden Hall...

4006
03:07:37,190 --> 03:07:37,630
And then...

4007
03:07:37,630 --> 03:07:38,830
The Imperial City...

4008
03:07:38,830 --> 03:07:39,610
And back and forth...

4009
03:07:39,610 --> 03:07:41,110
And back and forth...

4010
03:07:49,780 --> 03:07:51,040
Oh, I got a new bow!

4011
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:53,500
I was wondering what the bonus was...

4012
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:54,120
Is that what it was?

4013
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:55,960
I can't unsee...

4014
03:07:55,960 --> 03:07:56,340
Whatever...

4015
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:57,340
What is this statue?

4016
03:08:03,650 --> 03:08:05,420
Shadow Hunt!

4017
03:08:09,060 --> 03:08:11,180
It's enchanted with what?

4018
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:16,780
It's a bonus!

4019
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:18,420
Plus two...

4020
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:19,440
Plus two...

4021
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:22,180
Click the eye...

4022
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:31,580
I can't...

4023
03:08:32,750 --> 03:08:34,720
Turn Undead on Strike...

4024
03:08:40,180 --> 03:08:42,760
You consume fatigue while drawing a bow...

4025
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:44,260
Oh, wait...

4026
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:45,200
I'm a journeyman...

4027
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:46,340
You can focus your vision...

4028
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:46,760
Oh, yeah...

4029
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:47,160
Oh, okay...

4030
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:48,500
Yeah, that's right...

4031
03:08:48,500 --> 03:08:50,180
I gotta get to Expert...

4032
03:08:53,100 --> 03:08:54,280
Have a slight...

4033
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:56,220
Chance to paralyze the target on hit...

4034
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:56,820
That would be...

4035
03:08:58,720 --> 03:08:59,140
Big...

4036
03:08:59,140 --> 03:09:01,400
Yeah, I always have a great chance to paralyze...

4037
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:05,600
We'll get there eventually...

4038
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:07,180
Wait, what time is it?

4039
03:09:07,180 --> 03:09:08,280
Thanks for asking...

4040
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:13,440
Okay...

4041
03:09:13,440 --> 03:09:14,420
They'll be here soon...

4042
03:09:14,420 --> 03:09:15,300
Me children...

4043
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:16,160
Are starving...

4044
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,180
Me children...

4045
03:09:17,800 --> 03:09:19,140
Wait, what's in the basement?

4046
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:23,100
Oh, I can't go...

4047
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:25,080
I wanna paralyze!

4048
03:09:27,080 --> 03:09:28,920
Let's try it out...

4049
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,100
Maybe it's...

4050
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:31,120
Fancy...

4051
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,180
Who knows...

4052
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:36,600
Me children...

4053
03:09:36,600 --> 03:09:37,720
Oh, my acrobatics...

4054
03:09:37,720 --> 03:09:38,700
Let's go...

4055
03:09:41,360 --> 03:09:42,720
Maybe if I just like...

4056
03:09:42,720 --> 03:09:43,440
Practice...

4057
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:44,780
At um...

4058
03:09:44,780 --> 03:09:46,040
My shooting...

4059
03:09:46,040 --> 03:09:47,160
At like a range...

4060
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:48,280
I can get it up higher...

4061
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:48,600
You know...

4062
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:51,080
Nice level up...

4063
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:52,680
All I do is jump everywhere...

4064
03:09:56,220 --> 03:09:57,600
I'm always jumping...

4065
03:10:01,650 --> 03:10:02,650
Needs a key...

4066
03:10:03,910 --> 03:10:04,470
Aww...

4067
03:10:04,470 --> 03:10:06,570
Armand Kristoff's house...

4068
03:10:08,490 --> 03:10:09,990
I don't know that guy...

4069
03:10:09,990 --> 03:10:10,550
Oh, wait...

4070
03:10:10,550 --> 03:10:11,150
I can...

4071
03:10:11,150 --> 03:10:11,770
I can...

4072
03:10:11,770 --> 03:10:12,650
Level up now...

4073
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:14,330
I need to sleep...

4074
03:10:14,330 --> 03:10:15,530
Once we...

4075
03:10:15,530 --> 03:10:16,510
Once we get our guy here...

4076
03:10:17,110 --> 03:10:18,070
We'll wait...

4077
03:10:18,070 --> 03:10:19,450
Two hours...

4078
03:10:21,150 --> 03:10:22,090
Then we can...

4079
03:10:22,090 --> 03:10:23,690
Then we can sleep...

4080
03:10:23,690 --> 03:10:25,810
I could buy that house...

4081
03:10:26,370 --> 03:10:26,610
But...

4082
03:10:26,610 --> 03:10:28,590
I would much rather buy the haunted house...

4083
03:10:28,590 --> 03:10:29,810
Good to see you again...

4084
03:10:31,570 --> 03:10:32,450
Oh, wait...

4085
03:10:32,450 --> 03:10:34,010
Where can I sell things again?

4086
03:10:35,290 --> 03:10:35,730
Umm...

4087
03:10:35,730 --> 03:10:37,050
He's a captain of the...

4088
03:10:37,050 --> 03:10:37,310
No, no...

4089
03:10:37,310 --> 03:10:38,450
I don't care about this guy...

4090
03:10:40,070 --> 03:10:40,510
Umm...

4091
03:10:40,950 --> 03:10:41,830
What was it?

4092
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:43,770
Oh, it was somewhere...

4093
03:10:44,990 --> 03:10:46,630
About Thieves Guild is here...

4094
03:10:46,630 --> 03:10:47,430
What do you want to know?

4095
03:10:47,630 --> 03:10:48,510
Where can I sell?

4096
03:10:51,950 --> 03:10:53,070
Where's my Doyen?

4097
03:10:58,740 --> 03:11:01,960
The Doyen are the hands and eyes of the Guildmaster...

4098
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:03,600
You take your orders from them...

4099
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:05,580
You get your favors from them...

4100
03:11:05,580 --> 03:11:06,880
I am one Doyen...

4101
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:08,700
And Scriva is the other...

4102
03:11:16,070 --> 03:11:17,390
Where can I find a fence?

4103
03:11:17,510 --> 03:11:18,670
I'm looking for that...

4104
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:19,790
I can't even...

4105
03:11:19,790 --> 03:11:21,530
Oh, wait a minute...

4106
03:11:22,830 --> 03:11:24,350
Ah, it was the last thing...

4107
03:11:24,350 --> 03:11:24,890
That's why...

4108
03:11:24,890 --> 03:11:26,190
The best fences are only available...

4109
03:11:26,190 --> 03:11:27,690
To the higher rank Thieves Guild members...

4110
03:11:28,050 --> 03:11:28,670
Thank you...

4111
03:11:28,670 --> 03:11:30,470
Here's a list of who you can use...

4112
03:11:30,470 --> 03:11:31,010
Thank you...

4113
03:11:31,010 --> 03:11:32,170
Why does he look so sad?

4114
03:11:32,770 --> 03:11:33,210
Angar...

4115
03:11:33,210 --> 03:11:34,490
Angar lives in Bruma...

4116
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:34,710
Bruma...

4117
03:11:35,110 --> 03:11:35,510
Okay, thank...

4118
03:11:36,270 --> 03:11:36,710
Oh...

4119
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:37,450
Goodbye, goodbye...

4120
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:38,430
I'll work out my problem...

4121
03:11:38,430 --> 03:11:39,270
It's your prison...

4122
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:39,710
Thank you...

4123
03:11:39,710 --> 03:11:40,010
Goodbye...

4124
03:11:40,010 --> 03:11:42,730
Shadowhide you...

4125
03:11:43,190 --> 03:11:43,630
Bruma...

4126
03:11:43,630 --> 03:11:44,170
Bruma...

4127
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:45,030
Bruma...

4128
03:11:45,030 --> 03:11:46,050
It was like...

4129
03:11:46,050 --> 03:11:46,670
Up here?

4130
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:48,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

4131
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:54,880
Shadowhide you...

4132
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:56,840
Doesn't know Armand...

4133
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:57,960
Talks to Armand...

4134
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:01,840
Greetings, Bosmer...

4135
03:12:01,840 --> 03:12:03,360
Oh...

4136
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:05,100
Hello...

4137
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:06,780
Goodbye...

4138
03:12:06,780 --> 03:12:08,140
He was in...

4139
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:08,880
Uh...

4140
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:11,040
The...

4141
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:12,480
Like some...

4142
03:12:12,480 --> 03:12:13,920
Oh, I think it's down here...

4143
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:15,800
Oopsie...

4144
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:16,700
Oh God...

4145
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:17,100
Oh...

4146
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:18,380
I didn't get any...

4147
03:12:18,380 --> 03:12:19,680
I didn't get any...

4148
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:20,860
Fall damage...

4149
03:12:20,860 --> 03:12:22,940
He's in some sort of...

4150
03:12:26,670 --> 03:12:28,150
Bar or something...

4151
03:12:29,310 --> 03:12:30,670
I think it's this one...

4152
03:12:34,710 --> 03:12:35,790
I remember...

4153
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:40,370
Well, they're gonna have a skooma problem here soon...

4154
03:12:40,370 --> 03:12:41,400
Do you think what happened to Kvatch...

4155
03:12:41,790 --> 03:12:42,710
Could happen here?

4156
03:12:43,870 --> 03:12:44,410
No...

4157
03:12:44,410 --> 03:12:46,150
They were taken by surprise...

4158
03:12:46,150 --> 03:12:46,450
Hello...

4159
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,590
What can I do for you today?

4160
03:12:48,770 --> 03:12:49,310
Hello...

4161
03:12:49,310 --> 03:12:49,910
Um...

4162
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:50,450
You can...

4163
03:12:51,370 --> 03:12:51,910
Bye...

4164
03:12:51,910 --> 03:12:52,650
Wait, what's our...

4165
03:12:52,650 --> 03:12:53,650
What's our relationship at?

4166
03:12:54,290 --> 03:12:54,830
Oh...

4167
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:55,910
Not good...

4168
03:12:55,910 --> 03:12:57,170
Our relationship is...

4169
03:12:57,170 --> 03:12:57,750
Not good...

4170
03:12:57,750 --> 03:12:59,010
What, did you miss me or something?

4171
03:12:59,150 --> 03:13:01,050
I've bought from you before...

4172
03:13:04,510 --> 03:13:08,080
Maybe not...

4173
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:08,920
Oh...

4174
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:10,420
Bad luck...

4175
03:13:10,420 --> 03:13:11,900
I have no choice...

4176
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:17,120
That's...

4177
03:13:17,120 --> 03:13:18,180
Don't be silly...

4178
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:19,940
Blah, blah, blah...

4179
03:13:19,940 --> 03:13:20,220
What a bore...

4180
03:13:20,220 --> 03:13:21,200
Blah, blah, blah...

4181
03:13:21,940 --> 03:13:23,580
On guard, not Olaf...

4182
03:13:23,580 --> 03:13:25,320
I really don't get it...

4183
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:27,280
Good journey to you...

4184
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:30,260
Heard any news from the other provinces?

4185
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:33,920
I've heard that Nord warriors have traveled...

4186
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,620
I'm really tired...

4187
03:13:35,620 --> 03:13:37,120
Can we get on with this?

4188
03:13:39,420 --> 03:13:40,780
For you...

4189
03:13:40,780 --> 03:13:41,620
Of course...

4190
03:13:41,620 --> 03:13:42,900
Oh, that's right...

4191
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:43,900
He likes me...

4192
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:46,360
There...

4193
03:13:46,360 --> 03:13:48,120
My favorite customer...

4194
03:13:48,120 --> 03:13:48,900
What do you got?

4195
03:13:55,570 --> 03:13:56,330
Um...

4196
03:13:57,190 --> 03:13:57,950
Haku...

4197
03:14:01,080 --> 03:14:02,600
Maybe here...

4198
03:14:02,600 --> 03:14:04,940
Let's see...

4199
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:06,600
Nice...

4200
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:08,620
Cruelties are...

4201
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:09,980
It's worth 600...

4202
03:14:09,980 --> 03:14:11,080
Wait, what's black band?

4203
03:14:11,800 --> 03:14:12,940
I think I already...

4204
03:14:12,940 --> 03:14:13,940
I think I'm wearing that...

4205
03:14:13,940 --> 03:14:14,400
Yeah...

4206
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:15,780
Base ring of light...

4207
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:16,500
Oh, that's right...

4208
03:14:16,500 --> 03:14:17,340
We can have the...

4209
03:14:17,340 --> 03:14:19,400
I think we can sell this...

4210
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:21,900
I don't feel like I'm ever gonna use this that much...

4211
03:14:23,060 --> 03:14:23,500
Because...

4212
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:24,480
Um...

4213
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:26,480
It won't make me sneaky...

4214
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:29,540
If I really need light...

4215
03:14:29,540 --> 03:14:30,300
I don't feel like...

4216
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:31,800
Do you ever need light in this...

4217
03:14:31,800 --> 03:14:32,260
Game?

4218
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:34,480
I mean, I have a bunch of torches...

4219
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:40,720
Somewhere...

4220
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:41,860
They're somewhere...

4221
03:14:46,850 --> 03:14:49,630
I'll just sell it...

4222
03:14:49,630 --> 03:14:51,050
An excellent bargain...

4223
03:14:51,710 --> 03:14:52,270
Nice...

4224
03:14:52,270 --> 03:14:53,350
Where's the scuba?

4225
03:14:57,870 --> 03:14:58,430
Um...

4226
03:14:58,430 --> 03:14:59,930
Daedra heart...

4227
03:14:59,930 --> 03:15:00,890
Restore health...

4228
03:15:00,890 --> 03:15:02,210
Yeah, we'll keep that then...

4229
03:15:03,870 --> 03:15:04,350
Um...

4230
03:15:04,350 --> 03:15:05,750
Where is it?

4231
03:15:06,810 --> 03:15:07,870
Where is it?

4232
03:15:08,110 --> 03:15:08,890
Where is it?

4233
03:15:12,410 --> 03:15:12,890
Oh...

4234
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:15,990
Did I miss it?

4235
03:15:16,470 --> 03:15:17,370
Did I skip it?

4236
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:23,500
There it is...

4237
03:15:30,930 --> 03:15:32,410
What else did I steal?

4238
03:15:32,570 --> 03:15:33,710
Oh, repair hammer...

4239
03:15:35,650 --> 03:15:36,990
But I use those...

4240
03:15:36,990 --> 03:15:38,670
We'll use those on my...

4241
03:15:38,670 --> 03:15:38,990
Um...

4242
03:15:40,270 --> 03:15:41,390
On my...

4243
03:15:41,390 --> 03:15:41,770
Uh...

4244
03:15:41,770 --> 03:15:42,530
My bow...

4245
03:15:42,530 --> 03:15:43,470
It needs it...

4246
03:15:43,470 --> 03:15:44,730
But actually...

4247
03:15:44,730 --> 03:15:45,810
Wait...

4248
03:15:45,810 --> 03:15:47,050
We could probably...

4249
03:15:47,050 --> 03:15:47,990
I got this bow...

4250
03:15:49,790 --> 03:15:50,910
It's better...

4251
03:15:50,910 --> 03:15:51,790
We could...

4252
03:15:51,790 --> 03:15:53,210
Have another bow as a backup...

4253
03:15:53,550 --> 03:15:53,950
But...

4254
03:15:53,950 --> 03:15:54,590
This one...

4255
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:55,350
Like the steel bow...

4256
03:15:55,350 --> 03:15:56,110
We can get rid of...

4257
03:15:56,110 --> 03:15:56,250
No?

4258
03:15:56,370 --> 03:15:57,970
Cause it's heavy...

4259
03:16:01,080 --> 03:16:02,380
I think it might be...

4260
03:16:02,380 --> 03:16:03,400
Okay to sell it...

4261
03:16:05,300 --> 03:16:06,880
Don't really need backups...

4262
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:07,860
But what if I accidentally...

4263
03:16:07,860 --> 03:16:08,480
Don't realize...

4264
03:16:08,480 --> 03:16:09,220
And use it up...

4265
03:16:09,220 --> 03:16:10,400
And it breaks...

4266
03:16:17,460 --> 03:16:19,240
You ditch both extras...

4267
03:16:19,240 --> 03:16:19,420
Really?

4268
03:16:22,200 --> 03:16:23,020
So if...

4269
03:16:23,020 --> 03:16:24,300
Say this gets to zero...

4270
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:24,500
Bro...

4271
03:16:24,500 --> 03:16:25,300
It won't just disappear...

4272
03:16:25,300 --> 03:16:26,280
From my inventory...

4273
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:28,460
I just repair it...

4274
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:36,480
Oh...

4275
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:37,380
Oh okay...

4276
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:38,440
Nevermind then...

4277
03:16:38,440 --> 03:16:39,840
Goodbye...

4278
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:43,060
The suffer thorn...

4279
03:16:43,060 --> 03:16:45,000
Is worth so much...

4280
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:46,760
Oh my god...

4281
03:16:47,300 --> 03:16:48,920
Oh my god...

4282
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:49,760
I kinda want...

4283
03:16:49,760 --> 03:16:50,340
Can I...

4284
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:51,080
Well I guess...

4285
03:16:51,080 --> 03:16:52,340
We could sell this...

4286
03:16:52,340 --> 03:16:53,320
This blade...

4287
03:16:53,320 --> 03:16:53,540
Yeah...

4288
03:16:53,540 --> 03:16:54,220
Kinda sucks...

4289
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:56,000
Anyway...

4290
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:56,880
And...

4291
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:57,580
It says that...

4292
03:16:57,580 --> 03:16:58,380
We only had enough...

4293
03:16:58,380 --> 03:16:59,000
Langerwine...

4294
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:00,400
For one shot...

4295
03:17:00,400 --> 03:17:01,320
So...

4296
03:17:02,190 --> 03:17:02,480
Yeah...

4297
03:17:02,480 --> 03:17:03,980
I think I can move...

4298
03:17:03,980 --> 03:17:04,920
This item for you...

4299
03:17:04,920 --> 03:17:05,840
At that price...

4300
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:06,680
Thank you...

4301
03:17:06,680 --> 03:17:07,140
Got anything else?

4302
03:17:07,580 --> 03:17:09,320
I'm looking...

4303
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:12,660
Gosh...

4304
03:17:12,660 --> 03:17:13,560
This is also worth...

4305
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:14,260
So much...

4306
03:17:14,260 --> 03:17:15,540
I'm not even wearing it...

4307
03:17:15,540 --> 03:17:16,280
I'm wearing this...

4308
03:17:16,280 --> 03:17:17,520
Shrouded armor...

4309
03:17:17,520 --> 03:17:19,180
It is technically better...

4310
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:20,340
But...

4311
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:22,760
Actually...

4312
03:17:23,320 --> 03:17:24,880
I feel like I should sell it...

4313
03:17:24,880 --> 03:17:26,320
It's worth so much...

4314
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:28,920
And also...

4315
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:31,320
This gives me better points...

4316
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:41,440
Sell...

4317
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:41,780
Sell...

4318
03:17:41,780 --> 03:17:42,360
Sell...

4319
03:17:45,060 --> 03:17:46,040
Oh my gosh...

4320
03:17:46,040 --> 03:17:47,920
This will put us to 3,000 gold...

4321
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:49,540
That was kinda my goal today...

4322
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:51,540
Was 3,000 gold...

4323
03:17:55,960 --> 03:17:57,880
You can always buy it back...

4324
03:17:57,880 --> 03:17:58,240
Oh...

4325
03:17:58,240 --> 03:17:58,740
I guess...

4326
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:00,720
So...

4327
03:18:03,130 --> 03:18:03,690

4328
03:18:03,690 --> 03:18:04,350
Ooh...

4329
03:18:04,350 --> 03:18:05,690
A high, high penny...

4330
03:18:06,250 --> 03:18:07,670
Holy moly...

4331
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:07,950
Holy moly...

4332
03:18:07,950 --> 03:18:08,710

4333
03:18:13,770 --> 03:18:14,770
Yeah...

4334
03:18:17,680 --> 03:18:19,900
Anything else I can sell?

4335
03:18:20,400 --> 03:18:21,120
Let's...

4336
03:18:21,120 --> 03:18:22,160
Do buy this...

4337
03:18:22,860 --> 03:18:25,600
Potion of cure disease...

4338
03:18:25,680 --> 03:18:27,160
Lots of potion stuff...

4339
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:31,520
Fire salts...

4340
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:32,880
Mmm...

4341
03:18:37,610 --> 03:18:39,050
The varla stone...

4342
03:18:39,770 --> 03:18:41,090
That I got from...

4343
03:18:41,950 --> 03:18:43,530
The one cave...

4344
03:18:43,530 --> 03:18:44,530
The single cave...

4345
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:44,610
The...

4346
03:18:44,610 --> 03:18:45,950
No, I've done more than one cave...

4347
03:18:47,830 --> 03:18:48,750
Hehehehe...

4348
03:18:48,750 --> 03:18:49,670
Ah...

4349
03:18:49,670 --> 03:18:50,650

4352
03:18:52,930 --> 03:18:53,830
Ah...

4353
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:55,910
Too bad we...

4354
03:18:55,910 --> 03:18:56,970
We use these...

4355
03:18:56,970 --> 03:18:58,590
But that's okay...

4356
03:18:58,590 --> 03:18:59,650
Hmm...

4357
03:18:59,650 --> 03:19:01,050
That should be good...

4358
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:03,670
Yeah...

4359
03:19:03,670 --> 03:19:04,350
Some people were saying...

4360
03:19:04,350 --> 03:19:05,630
It's a quest item...

4361
03:19:05,630 --> 03:19:05,830
You'll...

4362
03:19:05,830 --> 03:19:06,470
You need to...

4363
03:19:06,470 --> 03:19:07,690
You need to sell...

4364
03:19:07,690 --> 03:19:09,650
A statue to start a quest...

4365
03:19:12,150 --> 03:19:12,670
Oh...

4366
03:19:14,170 --> 03:19:15,650
You could hit almost 4K...

4367
03:19:17,570 --> 03:19:18,090
Yeah...

4368
03:19:18,650 --> 03:19:19,650
Sell a bunch of the potions...

4369
03:19:20,590 --> 03:19:21,170
But like...

4370
03:19:21,170 --> 03:19:22,670
What if I need them...

4371
03:19:22,670 --> 03:19:23,830
Weak potion of sorcery...

4372
03:19:24,950 --> 03:19:26,910
I think I will sell that...

4373
03:19:28,330 --> 03:19:29,830
Sell to the dark elf...

4374
03:19:29,830 --> 03:19:30,690
In the merchant district...

4375
03:19:30,690 --> 03:19:31,010
In...

4376
03:19:31,010 --> 03:19:31,950
In Imperial city...

4377
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:32,860
For max money...

4378
03:19:34,810 --> 03:19:35,270
Really?

4379
03:19:35,650 --> 03:19:36,170
Oh yeah...

4380
03:19:36,170 --> 03:19:37,590
Why am I selling things that...

4381
03:19:37,590 --> 03:19:38,610
To him that...

4382
03:19:38,610 --> 03:19:39,880
I didn't steal...

4383
03:19:42,810 --> 03:19:44,490
There was one thing though...

4384
03:19:44,490 --> 03:19:45,990
That I had...

4385
03:19:45,990 --> 03:19:47,010
That said I was...

4386
03:19:47,010 --> 03:19:47,830
That was stolen...

4387
03:19:48,790 --> 03:19:50,040
Not the repair hammer...

4388
03:19:50,570 --> 03:19:52,210
It was like a scroll or something...

4389
03:19:52,210 --> 03:19:52,670
This...

4390
03:19:52,670 --> 03:19:55,090
House upper wall hangings...

4391
03:19:57,170 --> 03:19:58,010
Eh...

4392
03:19:58,450 --> 03:19:58,870
Whatever...

4393
03:19:58,870 --> 03:20:00,310
I'm glad that's done...

4394
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:01,570
I need a nap...

4395
03:20:01,570 --> 03:20:02,550
Okay...

4396
03:20:02,550 --> 03:20:04,370
I don't know...

4397
03:20:04,370 --> 03:20:06,510
Why would you do that?

4398
03:20:07,350 --> 03:20:08,590
He's kind of like...

4399
03:20:08,590 --> 03:20:10,150
A guild master...

4400
03:20:10,150 --> 03:20:11,430
For the thieves guild...

4401
03:20:11,430 --> 03:20:12,610
All I know is...

4402
03:20:12,610 --> 03:20:13,830
That the Doyen...

4403
03:20:13,830 --> 03:20:15,530
And other senior guild members...

4404
03:20:15,530 --> 03:20:16,610
Do his bidding...

4405
03:20:16,610 --> 03:20:17,670
Like trained dogs...

4406
03:20:18,470 --> 03:20:18,950
Hmm...

4407
03:20:19,610 --> 03:20:20,670
Trained dogs...

4408
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:24,290
Shadow hide you...

4409
03:20:24,670 --> 03:20:27,150
But our mercantile went up too...

4410
03:20:29,190 --> 03:20:30,750
Well guys...

4411
03:20:30,750 --> 03:20:31,490
Oh...

4415
03:20:38,890 --> 03:20:39,970

03:20:40,870 --> 03:20:41,470
Let's go...

4418
03:20:41,470 --> 03:20:42,710
There should be a...

4419
03:20:42,710 --> 03:20:44,230
Like a mages guild...

4420
03:20:44,230 --> 03:20:44,990
Thing here...

4421
03:20:46,550 --> 03:20:47,350
Right...

4422
03:20:48,310 --> 03:20:48,710
Right...

4423
03:20:49,110 --> 03:20:50,690
Mages guild...

4424
03:20:50,690 --> 03:20:51,470
Mages guild...

4425
03:20:52,030 --> 03:20:54,470
Maybe they have beds in the chapel...

4426
03:20:55,970 --> 03:20:57,510
Mages guild...

4427
03:20:57,510 --> 03:20:58,470
House for sale...

4428
03:20:59,270 --> 03:21:01,550
I don't remember what guilds I've...

4429
03:21:01,550 --> 03:21:01,950
What I...

4430
03:21:01,950 --> 03:21:03,470
What I joined...

4431
03:21:04,250 --> 03:21:04,970
Ah...

4432
03:21:04,970 --> 03:21:06,950
Brewing my mages guild...

4433
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:11,320
Yeah...

4434
03:21:11,320 --> 03:21:12,520
But if I sleep in an inn...

4435
03:21:12,520 --> 03:21:13,120
I have to pay money...

4436
03:21:13,740 --> 03:21:14,540
Hello there...

4437
03:21:15,860 --> 03:21:16,380
Hello...

4438
03:21:18,220 --> 03:21:18,740
Here...

4439
03:21:18,740 --> 03:21:20,660
If I go to the mages guild...

4440
03:21:20,660 --> 03:21:22,080
It's free...

4441
03:21:23,440 --> 03:21:24,620
Happy Father's Day...

4442
03:21:24,620 --> 03:21:25,000
On this day...

4443
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,080
Be sure to tell dad jokes to your dad...

4444
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:30,520
Tell dad jokes to your dad...

4445
03:21:31,780 --> 03:21:32,300
Everybody...

4446
03:21:32,300 --> 03:21:33,040
Alright...

4447
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:33,900
Let's...

4448
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:35,080
Wooden door...

4449
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:37,360
Okay...

4450
03:21:38,260 --> 03:21:38,900
Let's...

4451
03:21:38,900 --> 03:21:40,240
Algebra is like divorce...

4452
03:21:40,240 --> 03:21:41,520
You look at your ex...

4453
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,240
And wonder...

4454
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:43,320
Why...

4455
03:21:47,080 --> 03:21:47,720
Oh...

4456
03:21:48,840 --> 03:21:50,120
Not here...

4457
03:21:50,120 --> 03:21:51,120
Where can I sleep?

4458
03:21:54,240 --> 03:21:56,000
Let me sleep...

4459
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,080
Let me go to sleep...

4460
03:22:02,900 --> 03:22:04,180
Oh, living quarters...

4461
03:22:04,180 --> 03:22:04,860
Here we go...

4462
03:22:06,460 --> 03:22:10,560
Perfect, perfect, perfect... I

4463
03:22:16,720 --> 03:22:43,810
don't think... I don't think Vol... Volanro is actually asleep here... I think somebody... Was about to be caught doing something naughty... Me, when my mom walks in... Trying to play... My... Trying to play Pokemon under my sheets... Selena...

4464
03:22:45,190 --> 03:22:49,330
Let's sleep with... Selena...

4465
03:23:03,660 --> 03:23:07,260
Can we max... Isn't 100 the max?

4466
03:23:07,620 --> 03:23:10,720
Did we just max our... Agility?

4467
03:23:13,080 --> 03:23:21,760
Oh my gosh... Let's do more speed... Endurance is what?

4468
03:23:22,400 --> 03:23:28,040
A health out of combat... We could get a better personality...

4469
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:59,860
Yeah... We could start doing our personality again... This will help us... Oh, that's right... We can only do a couple... I don't think max strength... Would help with the... Assassins... Because it's only like... Long swords... And things like that... But it does help our max health... This is what... The max agility... Is what helps us...

4470
03:23:59,860 --> 03:24:09,660
Do those... Assassins... Those assassinations... Yeah... Yeah... Strength does help with loot...

4471
03:24:13,430 --> 03:24:15,910
Or do I do luck?

4472
03:24:19,960 --> 03:24:30,840
Oh my gosh... One luck is four things... That's crazy... Wow... Luck isn't worth... Is it bad in this game?

4473
03:24:32,580 --> 03:24:34,500
We can go with strength...

4474
03:24:37,340 --> 03:24:37,820
Yeah...

4475
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:41,400
Yeah...

4476
03:24:41,400 --> 03:25:01,530
We'll do endurance... Next time... Anytime now... I'm not talking to you... Hmm... Luck is pricey... It is pricey... Yeah... How do I get out of this place?

4477
03:25:01,730 --> 03:25:09,630
Oh, here we go... Awesome... Well, guys... I think that's where I'm gonna...

4478
03:25:11,410 --> 03:25:39,130
Stop... Stop... I think we... We killed lots... We... Did some good quests... Uh... We made it to... Over 3,000 gold... So we just need... 1,800 gold... More... So if we can kill... If we can do that... The last two people... In that one quest... That will make it so that we only have... 800 more gold... That's crazy...

4479
03:25:39,130 --> 03:26:08,590
Then we can buy our house... Our haunted house... Uh... Yeah... We killed lots of people today... I pickpocketed... But they were... Fake sleeping... So they actually woke up... And got mad at me... What is it... What is... What... What... Quest am I... Currently on... Oh... Enter the Eliminator...

4480
03:26:08,590 --> 03:26:22,580
Accept the contract from Oceiva... Oh... I wanted to do this one... Wait... I wanna go just see what it looks like... I just wanna see what it... Where is it?

4481
03:26:27,700 --> 03:26:30,020
Where... Where is this... Bug?

4482
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:34,360
Huh?

4483
03:26:34,660 --> 03:26:40,940
Wait... It doesn't show up on the map... Whoa...

4484
03:26:48,070 --> 03:26:49,050
Oh...

4485
03:26:49,050 --> 03:26:49,710
Wow...

4486
03:26:49,710 --> 03:26:49,930
Wait...

4487
03:26:49,930 --> 03:26:50,830
I kinda wanna go see...

4488
03:26:52,250 --> 03:27:03,240
I just wanna see... I just wanna see... Just a little bit... What it looks like... You know... I don't think we... Have I been here before?

4489
03:27:04,740 --> 03:27:09,640
I actually have no idea...

4490
03:27:15,900 --> 03:27:16,220
No?

4491
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:28,540
Uh oh... I'm supposed to adventure... To new places... My bad... I'm supposed to not... Hello... Oh my god... Hi...

4492
03:27:29,940 --> 03:27:35,180
Oh... Oh... You have a portal to oblivion... Like right outside your house...

4493
03:27:39,430 --> 03:27:40,870
Whoa...

4494
03:27:40,870 --> 03:27:43,610
It's really boggy here...

4495
03:27:49,300 --> 03:27:56,940
Maybe we can just go in and out... Maybe we can kill him... In and out baby... Oh no... You gotta go into a cave?

4496
03:27:58,220 --> 03:28:00,440
Oh... No we don't...

4497
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:09,440
Maybe it's just in and out...

4498
03:28:12,730 --> 03:28:16,630
This is way less boggy than I expected...

4499
03:28:16,630 --> 03:28:17,730
Where's the water?

4500
03:28:18,910 --> 03:28:20,070
Where's the water?

4501
03:28:20,650 --> 03:28:22,110
What are these?

4502
03:28:24,170 --> 03:28:45,710
Ew... Bog beacon... It's cute... He's so far... Nah... He's not that far away... If we st... Oh... If we start sneaking over... He won't see us... Maybe... Wait... This way...

4503
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:57,400
Sorry...

4504
03:28:57,400 --> 03:28:58,460
I know I said I was gonna end...

4505
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:09,720
I'm sorry... I know I said I was gonna end... But I really did want to do this one... This quest... It seemed fun...

4506
03:29:13,300 --> 03:29:24,740
I think I found his... Little campsite... Bog water... Discovered... Oh there he is...

4507
03:29:28,030 --> 03:29:29,730
Hey...

4508
03:29:29,730 --> 03:29:30,510
What is it now?

4509
03:29:31,910 --> 03:29:35,310
Scartail... I guess I've been expecting you... Assassin...

4510
03:29:36,310 --> 03:29:47,390
Don't try to deny it... Don't try to deny it... I can see it in your eyes... You're a dark brother... Through and through... Let me guess... You can see it in my eyes... It wasn't Jeeva... Right?

4511
03:29:48,770 --> 03:29:54,290
Now... Wait... Tainava... Yes... He put you up to this... Didn't he?

4512
03:29:55,030 --> 03:30:05,030
Tainava... And Jeeva was always too busy... To be even bothered... Well... You can kill me... If you like... I'm afraid I won't make much of a challenge... Though...

4513
03:30:05,030 --> 03:30:10,310
The Argonian royal court... Already sent an agent to do the job... Yeah?

4514
03:30:10,610 --> 03:30:25,610
He failed... Of course... His body's around here somewhere... But he got in a pretty good hit... I'm gonna loot that body... If I don't get some rest... I'm probably dead anyway... So... Maybe I can appeal to your sense of goodwill... Huh?

4515
03:30:26,310 --> 03:30:27,570
I knew it!

4516
03:30:27,810 --> 03:30:33,750
You let me live... And I'll tell you where I stashed my treasure... Is it a deal?

4517
03:30:37,370 --> 03:30:41,550
I should've saved... Treasure?

4518
03:30:53,900 --> 03:31:02,640
He could lie... He could lie... Or we get it... And then we kill him... Why not both?

4519
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:14,140
Yeah... I'm gonna... I'm gonna tell him... And then I'll kill him... Yeah... You show... Unexpected mercy... For that... I am thankful...

4520
03:31:14,140 --> 03:31:25,940
My treasure... Is hidden in a hollowed out rock... Near my campfire... It's yours... Oh yes... I suppose... Tynava wants proof... That I'm dead... Eh?

4521
03:31:26,780 --> 03:31:44,120
Let me guess... My heart... Hmm... I suggest you take the heart... Of the dead Argonian agent... His body's around here somewhere... Present the agent's heart to Tynava as proof... And he'll be none the wiser... I don't believe that though...

4522
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:51,460
I don't... I don't actually believe... That he'll be none the wiser... For some reason... I think he's gonna know... You know?

4523
03:31:53,680 --> 03:31:56,620
I think he's gonna know...

4524
03:32:00,290 --> 03:32:01,490
Save?

4525
03:32:03,270 --> 03:32:03,750
Yeah...

4526
03:32:03,750 --> 03:32:19,500
You're right... Wait... Let me... Let me do a hard save too... What we could do... What we could do... Is... Um...

4527
03:32:21,280 --> 03:32:23,280
Hollowed rock... Where?

4528
03:32:24,400 --> 03:32:45,540
Is... Get the... Get the... Get the... Other... Oh, here it is... His treasure is 100 gold... Is... Get the... Other guy's heart... And then... Um... Present it... And see if it works... You know?

4529
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:47,780
Wow, there's so many Oblivion portals here...

4530
03:32:51,780 --> 03:32:54,320
It's by the tree... Here?

4531
03:32:57,790 --> 03:32:58,370
What?

4532
03:32:58,590 --> 03:33:06,490
Uh... I... I hate to... I regret to inform you... We are in a... A forest... Oh!

4533
03:33:08,700 --> 03:33:08,940
Oh!

4534
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:19,360
There we go... So let's try it... Silver dagger... We could sell that... You

4535
03:33:22,740 --> 03:33:26,860
have to obtain the Argonian's heart... I must now return to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and...

4536
03:33:27,580 --> 03:33:32,700
Yeah... Yeah... Let's... Let's try it... Let's try it...

4537
03:33:40,310 --> 03:33:41,570
Hmm...

4538
03:33:41,570 --> 03:33:43,170
You could sell all of that... Oh!

4539
03:33:43,370 --> 03:33:47,430
I didn't think about it... Eh... It's fine...

4540
03:33:55,320 --> 03:33:56,240
Hmm...

4541
03:33:56,240 --> 03:33:56,980
Nah...

4542
03:33:56,980 --> 03:34:10,770
Let's see... I lied to him... But... Lying's not a crime... Excuse me, brother... Can you spare a moment?

4543
03:34:11,230 --> 03:34:13,410
Yes, brother... Let's see...

4544
03:34:14,570 --> 03:34:32,490
Just call me Ocelot... Just call me Ocelot... I work for myself... Me alone... Where is our brother?

4545
03:34:38,300 --> 03:34:42,200
Lying in court... I... What?

4546
03:34:42,300 --> 03:34:44,540
Are we in a... Court of law now?

4547
03:34:44,760 --> 03:34:49,580
I don't think so... Since when did the Dark Brotherhood ever follow...

4548
03:34:51,260 --> 03:34:55,980
Laws... Aw... Screw you... Hail,

4549
03:34:59,280 --> 03:35:01,620
my sister... Of course... What is it?

4550
03:35:01,760 --> 03:35:03,840
No, no, no... I have to talk to what I said... So... Ha!

4551
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:03,960
Yes!

4552
03:35:04,660 --> 03:35:11,460
That is an Argonian heart... Of that I am sure... You have slain Scartail... Well done... Ah!

4553
03:35:12,200 --> 03:35:16,120
Please... Take these boots as payment for your services... Did it work?

4554
03:35:16,280 --> 03:35:21,540
They are called the Boots of Bloody Bounding... And carry a powerful enchantment... Ooh...

4555
03:35:21,540 --> 03:35:51,300
I am sure you will find them most useful... Thank you... Scartail was once as a brother to me and Nochiva... But his act of treason... Destroyed any vestige of that relationship... His death was well deserved... Damn... May you walk always... In the shadow of Sithis... Dear sister... Ha ha ha ha ha... Getting pushed around by a skelly... Let's put this on...

4556
03:35:54,720 --> 03:35:59,520
Do you see the price?

4557
03:36:00,880 --> 03:36:02,980
Oh my gosh.

4558
03:36:07,410 --> 03:36:09,950
Is that all I can wear?

4559
03:36:11,490 --> 03:36:13,290
Oh no.

4560
03:36:36,880 --> 03:36:38,800
Oh no.

4561
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:41,460
What do we do?

4562
03:36:49,280 --> 03:36:51,840
I also noticed that...

4563
03:36:54,060 --> 03:36:56,680
Um... I should probably wear this, huh?

4564
03:36:57,200 --> 03:36:58,500
This goes down.

4565
03:36:58,980 --> 03:37:05,220
Is it... Can I also use the repair on these to make them the... the effects last?

4566
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:10,100
Oh, I can!

4567
03:37:10,220 --> 03:37:10,920
Oh, awesome.

4568
03:37:11,200 --> 03:37:11,700
Okay, cool.

4569
03:37:15,260 --> 03:37:17,300
Fortify acrobatics on self.

4570
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:18,960
Fortify blade on self.

4571
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:23,140
Oh... No!

4572
03:37:23,540 --> 03:37:24,900
This is so sad.

4573
03:37:32,550 --> 03:37:34,070
Oh, this is so sad.

4574
03:37:34,350 --> 03:37:35,770
Anyway, that's for future Minto.

4575
03:37:36,010 --> 03:37:38,630
We completed that quest, so...

4576
03:37:38,630 --> 03:37:39,070
Yippee!

4577
03:37:39,870 --> 03:37:43,810
They're part of an armor set that was removed before release, so you'll never get a full set.

4578
03:37:44,030 --> 03:37:45,030
Your choice.

4579
03:37:47,490 --> 03:37:48,610
Nice shoes.

4580
03:37:50,550 --> 03:37:51,870
Oh, hey.

4581
03:37:52,430 --> 03:37:52,990
Get out of the way.

4582
03:37:53,030 --> 03:37:53,970
Hail, my sister.

4583
03:37:54,650 --> 03:37:55,750
Get out of the way.

4584
03:37:57,250 --> 03:37:58,590
Aw, man.

4585
03:38:02,820 --> 03:38:04,180
Aw, man.

4586
03:38:04,700 --> 03:38:06,880
Well, if we sell them, we sell them.

4587
03:38:06,880 --> 03:38:11,020
If we save them for future armor, that works as well.

4588
03:38:11,600 --> 03:38:13,140
But, um...

4589
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:14,500
This is where we will...

4590
03:38:14,500 --> 03:38:15,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4591
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:16,620
Why are you glowing?

4592
03:38:16,920 --> 03:38:18,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4593
03:38:18,380 --> 03:38:18,860
Whoa!

4594
03:38:19,240 --> 03:38:20,140
Why are we...

4595
03:38:20,140 --> 03:38:20,940
Why are we glowing?

4596
03:38:23,080 --> 03:38:24,160
Oh, it's the armor.

4597
03:38:24,340 --> 03:38:25,080
Whatever we're wearing.

4598
03:38:30,740 --> 03:38:32,260
Because of the enchantments.

4599
03:38:32,440 --> 03:38:32,600
Yeah.

4600
03:38:33,180 --> 03:38:33,880
Whoa, freaky.

4601
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:36,860
Freak Tina.

4602
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:43,300
I'm trying to just see her face, man.

4603
03:38:43,480 --> 03:38:43,740
Stand clear.

4604
03:38:44,720 --> 03:38:45,240
What?

4605
03:38:46,300 --> 03:38:48,320
I just want to see her lovely face.

4606
03:38:48,980 --> 03:38:50,120
While I say goodbye.

4607
03:38:51,800 --> 03:38:53,140
She's a ghost now.

4608
03:38:54,640 --> 03:38:55,620
Maybe in here.

4609
03:38:56,400 --> 03:38:57,400
It's the lighting mother.

4610
03:38:59,380 --> 03:39:00,260
A little bit.

4611
03:39:03,080 --> 03:39:03,980
Ah, good enough.

4612
03:39:03,980 --> 03:39:05,160
Thank you guys.

4613
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:06,160
For real, for real.

4614
03:39:06,840 --> 03:39:07,920
Now, now I'm leaving.

4615
03:39:08,900 --> 03:39:10,000
I'm a bit hungry.

4616
03:39:10,240 --> 03:39:10,980
So, I'm going to go eat dinner.

4617
03:39:11,380 --> 03:39:13,880
Thank you guys for more Oblivion.

4618
03:39:14,320 --> 03:39:15,340
And hanging out with me.

4619
03:39:18,100 --> 03:39:20,980
I don't know if I'm going to be streaming Monday or Tuesday yet.

4620
03:39:21,100 --> 03:39:24,380
But that will be all that I stream this week.

4621
03:39:24,380 --> 03:39:25,120
I apologize.

4622
03:39:25,420 --> 03:39:26,380
It's a...

4623
03:39:26,380 --> 03:39:28,140
It's a bit of a shorter week.

4624
03:39:30,020 --> 03:39:31,320
And then there's Off Kai.

4625
03:39:31,520 --> 03:39:32,620
I got to prepare for Off Kai.

4626
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:35,880
Super fun and profitable run.

4627
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:36,300
3K.

4628
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:38,080
Plus.

4629
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:39,040
And boots.

4630
03:39:39,340 --> 03:39:39,520

4634
03:39:44,780 --> 03:39:46,920
Having so much fun watching all the murder and mayhem.

4635
03:39:47,860 --> 03:39:48,740
That is...

4636
03:39:48,740 --> 03:39:49,920
What happens.

4637

03:39:55,980 --> 03:39:56,980
Yeah, I'm going to go...

4642
03:39:57,680 --> 03:39:59,300
In fact, I'm going to use my...

4643
03:39:59,300 --> 03:40:00,100
Throat spray.

4644
03:40:04,090 --> 03:40:05,230
And I'm going to go rest.

4645
03:40:05,750 --> 03:40:06,370

4649
03:40:08,890 --> 03:40:09,650
Good night, Damien.

4650
03:40:10,810 --> 03:40:11,590
Atsumito, everybody.

4651

Okay.

4655
03:40:21,970 --> 03:40:22,370
Atsumito.

4656
03:40:22,950 --> 03:40:23,710
Bye-bye, everyone.

4657
03:40:23,890 --> 03:40:24,570
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

4658
03:40:24,770 --> 03:40:25,870

Have a good night.

4663
03:40:28,250 --> 03:40:30,130
Wait, let me see if anyone's streaming.

4664
03:40:31,610 --> 03:40:33,970
If anybody's streaming.

4665
03:40:36,310 --> 03:40:37,970
I don't see anybody.

4666
03:40:39,050 --> 03:40:40,590
I don't see anyone.

4667
03:40:43,150 --> 03:40:43,970
Okay.

4668
03:40:44,350 --> 03:40:44,750
