9
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,960
I had to change some settings.

10
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,280
I already changed things that hopefully would reduce lag and everything.

11
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,040
If I'm lagging, it's okay.

12
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,400
Oh, thank you for that, guys.

13
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,940

28
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,260

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,470
Oh my god.

30
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,270
I'm gonna cry.

31
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,310
I'm already crying.

32
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
Pretty good.

33
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:34,180
I just came back from a convention, MGSCon, where I was a digital host.

34
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
And I had so much fun.

35
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
And everybody was so nice.

36
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,080
And...

37
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,380
Wow.

38
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
Look, there's so many of you guys.

39
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,100
Wait, what are you talking about?

40
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,280
What is yours?

41
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,540
I can't even tell.

42
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,300
And, um...

43
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,360
So, I'm already so, like, hyped on Metal Gear stuff.

44
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,080
And...

45
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,640
Um...

46
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Oh, my gosh.

47
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,780
Oh, my gosh.

48
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,200
And now we're playing...

49
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,160
Oh my god.

50
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,780
And now we're playing...

51
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
Even though...

52
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,490
Even though it's not a new story.

53
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,010
It's still so exciting.

54
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,990
And, um...

55
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,010
For anybody...

56
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,030
I'll just say this right now.

57
00:08:39,050 --> 00:09:05,850
now because I know many people have many opinions um if you want to be you know if you want to state your negative opinion this is not the place to do so so um you know there there's lots of other avenues please don't use my chat nor my comment section you will be either banned or timed out so

58
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,190
So, please, please.

59
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,390
We're just here to have fun, okay?

60
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,490
Reddit exists for that.

61
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,710
Exactly.

62
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,970
Game has been getting super positive reviews.

63
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,690
I've played it twice now.

64
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,710
I played it at TGS last year, and now I'm playing it...

65
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,510
Or I played it a couple weeks ago in New York.

66
00:09:39,050 --> 00:10:07,390
now but the first time I played it I'm pretty sure it was Xbox set last time it was PS5 and now I'm playing it PC I honestly would have played it on my PS5 but I was a dummy dumb and I got the super deluxe edition to play early on Steam and I didn't think about it I didn't think about it so I was like oh shoot.

67
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,550
I know I'm going to be all laggy and everything, but it's okay.

68
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,350
It's okay.

69
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,830
My negative opinion is that Ocelot should strip.

70
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,790
So true.

71
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,470
So true.

72
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,330
Why are you playing with a controller?

73
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,470
Of course I am.

74
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,650
Of course.

75
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,530
That's actually why.

76
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,390
At the pop-up in New York, they had like all the different systems.

77
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,930
Most people actually picked PC, which I thought was pretty interesting.

78
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,890
but I didn't remember seeing if the PC version had a controller with it.

79
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,990
And I knew I would be playing with controller because it just feels natural.

80
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,930
It just feels natural, so I was like, I'll just pick the PS5 version.

81
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:06,510
And I know some people were saying that the PS5 version has frame rate issues, but I didn't experience anything when I played it.

82
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,990
I don't know.

83
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,510
I don't really care about that kind of stuff.

84
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm just here for Metal Gear.

85
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,830
I'm just here for Metal Gear to have a good time.

86
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,050
So let's not bring that up.

87
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:32,010
You know, if I have issues, I like I'm having issues kind of right now, but that is to be expected with being a digital anime woman.

88
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,410
This happens every time.

89
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,610
This is this is not on the game.

90
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,450
It's I'm too, I'm too, I'm too beefy.

91
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,810
So, yeah.

92
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,130
Let's just, uh, let's just have fun with it, okay?

93
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,690
Again, please don't get, I don't want to see it.

94
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,870
If you have anything negative to say, go scream it into the sea.

95
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,750
Go outside or yell it into your pillow.

96
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,910
Yeah!

97
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,350
This is guy in my profile picture.

98
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,460
You guys with your profile pictures are so funny.

99
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,120
If I don't have a seat?

100
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,540
Yeah, scream it into your pillow.

101
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,560
I want to play as much as I can today.

102
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,040
I might just get really into it.

103
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,960
And play the whole thing.

104
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Who knows?

105
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,840
Who knows?

106
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,460
But...

107
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,520
Yeah!

108
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,340
I'm excited.

109
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,410
Wait, you can hear it.

110
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,790
Okay, good.

111
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,850
I turned the music.

112
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,550
I want to play Snake versus...

113
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,890
Did you guys know Astrobotus in this game?

114
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,670
Look at him hugging him so tightly.

115
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,410
Did you guys know Astrobotus in this game too?

116
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,250
This game was...

117
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,190
It's perfect.

118
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,430
Yeah, he's in the people.

119
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,930
Snake V Monkey.

120
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,410
And I guess you have to beat the game to unlock the...

121
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,810
The, what's it?

122
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,450
Fox Hunt?

123
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,810
What's under Extras?

124
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,590
So, Secret Theater, I think is kind of funny.

125
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,090
How they do it.

126
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,350
You can either collect...

127
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,030
Oh my god.

128
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,930
Oh my god, the music.

129
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,410
Sorry.

130
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,990
I think of us a lot.

131
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,530
Sorry.

132
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,170
You can either collect them in the game or it's kind of nice.

133
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,130
They all unlock at the end.

134
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,770
That's our camel collection.

135
00:13:46,050 --> 00:14:18,470

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,250
I know.

137
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,430
No,

138
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,610
no, no.

139
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,070
I'm not ready for that one.

140
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,490
This is so funny.

141
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,970
I wore this one when I played.

142
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,650
I wore this one when I played in New York.

143
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,730
It's so good without the hat.

144
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,210
I don't know.

145
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,810
It's just so, like, wide around his neck.

146
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,350
He's an absolute unit.

147
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,290
Look at this man.

148
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,390
Holy cow.

149
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,930
I need to see his ass better.

150
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,870
We'll see it when he's crawling around, maybe.

151
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm excited, too, to see, like, the scarring system.

152
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
I feel like we haven't really seen much of that.

153
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,080
It's shown off at all.

154
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,600
Wow, he's really...

155
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,020
Wow, the vids!

156
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:17,920
Whoa!

157
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,500
Wait, there's a zoom in.

158
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, oh, oh, no, I'm not.

159
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,480
Can't do that.

160
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,140
Okay, and then we can just make him go.

161
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,320
Holy cow.

162
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
What is his face?

163
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Ew.

164
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,560
Ew.

165
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Ew.

166
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Ew.

167
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I... Ew.

168
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,680
Ew.

169
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,460
And for anybody wondering, yes, if you do spin him around in the viewfinder, he does throw up.

170
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,040
That was the first thing I checked.

171
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,600
Ew.

172
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,220
I hate this.

173
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,800
I feel like his eyes really just throw it off.

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
He's a trophy now.

175
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,420
Trophy.

176
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,340
Trophy wife.

177
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,020
So yeah, we'll get the other ones.

178
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,960
What's this one?

179
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,620
Mysterious.

180
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,740
Oh wait, do I have to download them?

181
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,920
Oh no, I guess that means DLC, right?

182
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,860
Oh, I can't look at the token.

183
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
I don't think I'm ready for it.

184
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,560
I can't look at the tuxedo.

185
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,400
I am the owner of the one and only 24 karat.

186
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,020
Wait, actually.

187
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,500
Wait.

188
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,300
Oh, they say what each one does.

189
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,940
That's kind of nice.

190
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,180
Significantly lowers the camo index while boosting movement speed.

191
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,380
Naked.

192
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Naked with belts of ammo.

193
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,440
That's all it is.

194
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,440
It's just naked.

195
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,360
Naked with camouflage.

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,400
Makes any food taste great while also boosting movement speed.

197
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,880
when crawling and increasing stamina consumption.

198
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,940
What?

199
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,980
Move with finesse.

200
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,360
Hold on.

201
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm blocking my view.

202
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,000
Move with finesse.

203
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,380
Silencing.

204
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:08,980
Oh gosh.

205
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,300
I can't.

206
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,680
With him with glasses on.

207
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,280
I think I might I think I might go to heaven.

208
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,300
Okay, hold on.

209
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,500
Move with finesse.

210
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,060
Silencing your footsteps and doubling your natural life recovery rate.

211
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,540
If the jacket gets dirty, the effects are lost.

212
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,420
Shut up.

213
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,820
That's too good.

214
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,920
That's so funny.

215
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,540
No way.

216
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,240
I wonder if this one is like, yeah, greatly reduces all damage.

217
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:42,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,680
Boost natural life recovery, but decreases movement speed.

219
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,060
So it's kind of the same.

220
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,940
Yeah, yeah, eliminates the sound of footsteps.

221
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,900
Oh, yeah.

222
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
So these are sneak, but we get the sneaking suit later.

223
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:23,480
the the wow actually this one is quite big on his neck too no i guess it's not so tight as i expected it should be tighter tighter my oshi has literacy issues what are you talking about no i don't and there's so many here holy cow there's so many face Oh,

224
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,340
wait.

225
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,960
Oh, God.

226
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Okay.

227
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,100
Wait, we also have the masks, though.

228
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,860
Maybe they're not under face.

229
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay, I think sunglasses I'm okay with.

230
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,420
Wait.

231
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,180
Why is it?

232
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,720
It's showing up.

233
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,220
It's broken.

234
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,160
It's broken.

235
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,460
No preview for them?

236
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh, and then you get a, oh no, wow, snake.

237
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,520
Whatever, there's so many different kinds of snakes.

238
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,420
Land-based animal, water-based animal.

239
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,780
Mushroom.

240
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,740
Other.

241
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,580
Well, that must be, like, ramen and stuff.

242
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,020
Oh, there's a, oh, so guys, there's a camera.

243
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,820
There's a photo mode in this game.

244
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm, I'm so excited.

245
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,320
Okay, okay, we're done looking at extras.

246
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm ready to play the game.

247
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my gosh, okay.

248
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:41,600
This one I was excited about because I rushed through everything at the playthrough just to get to the cutscene with Ocelot when I played in New York.

249
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,340
So I actually didn't see which one, what these offer.

250
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,060
So I'm playing MGS for the first time.

251
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,920
Gives you a mummy uniform.

252
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,980
This one gives you a DPM.

253
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,920
What's DPM uniform?

254
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,320
This one gives you, I like MGS2, gives you Desert Tiger uniform.

255
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,380
Oh, the art.

256
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,900
I like MGS3 gives you the Fleck Tarn uniform.

257
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,520
And this is so exciting!

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Now we can, oh my gosh, we actually have, I like MGS4 and Onwards.

259
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,100
Like, that's so exciting.

260
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,640
I like MGS4, it gives you face green and face brown.

261
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,680
I like Peace Walker.

262
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,400
Oh my gosh, this is so perfect.

263
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,080
Peace Walker gives you the banana uniform.

264
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,080
That's so perfect.

265
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
No poops, yeah.

266
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,640
Four, I mean, stop, that four.

267
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,240
Five gives you national flags.

268
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,200
Face.

269
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,180
Face, Nash, not uniform.

270
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,340
And then I like everything.

271
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,040
Gives you grenade uniform.

272
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:02,280
I'm assuming then we don't have I'm assuming then that the Rykov mask is automatically given to us?

273
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,100
That was some fancy freaking.

274
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,580
Where's the I like patchy slide option?

275
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,340
So I guess I'm assuming...

276
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,180
We all know that the mask is still there, so I guess I guess they just give it to you automatically.

277
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:35,680
though what's the grenade uniform what does it do they don't tell you what they do i like ghost babble

278
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,880
oh the old snake

279
00:21:47,020 --> 00:22:25,680
unlimited grenades wait actually infinite grenades are you guys are you guys pulling my leg that would be so crazy I wonder what the banana uniform does too does it make you smell like banana it's kind of nice yes no infinite ammo mmm make you smell like bananas and all the guards smell you and are just like mmm yummy what's a fleck torn uniform oh I'm gonna Google it.

280
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Guess what it means.

281
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,780
Flectar.

282
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,460
Flectar.

283
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,560
Sorry, my big old head is blocking exactly where it says the additional equipment.

284
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Ah, okay, it's just like, oh, it's just camo.

285
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
It's just a camo.

286
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,580
I like Revengeance all BGM changes to butt Brock Bradley.

287
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,700
Let's go with everything, man.

288
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,200
Because it's true.

289
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,460
Minus this one.

290
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,520
But, no, no, that's...

291
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,980
I'm kidding.

292
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm being harsh.

293
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm being harsh.

294
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,840
I also like that all of these pictures are snake except two.

295
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,320
They could have easily squeezed snake's face in there.

296
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,480
But nah, they were like, Raiden gets his time.

297
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,060
Raiden gets his time.

298
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,360
Okay, I like everything.

299
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,360
I want to play with modern action game controls.

300
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Move and fire weapons simultaneously.

301
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,460
Now here's where I'm a little...

302
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,700
I don't know what to do.

303
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Do I want to play...

304
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,460
I did try Legacy style at the New York playthrough.

305
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,100
But I'm also like, do I want to try the game through a new perspective?

306
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,100
Though I wonder if it'll become kind of like a twin snakes.

307
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,560
Where some bosses are like...

308
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,340
I think that was some people's concerns too.

309
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,720
If it would become a little like...

310
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,620
Too easy!

311
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,000
New style?

312
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,920
I think so too.

313
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm thinking, you know...

314
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,960
Well, I'm gonna put the filter on though, just to let you guys know.

315
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,200
I'm gonna put the...

316
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,420
You can change it whenever you want.

317
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,800
Okay, good to know.

318
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,940
I think a new style for a new, fresh playthrough, right?

319
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,040
What's button layout?

320
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,740
Oh!

321
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,040
Okay.

322
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,060
Oh gosh, it's all gonna be so different.

323
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,260
Not so different.

324
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,900
Stalking?

325
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
Oh yeah, bye bye.

326
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,920
Okay, we'll get to it.

327
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,800
We'll get to it.

328
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,180
Difficulty.

329
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm here for a good time.

330
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,900
So we're going on normal.

331
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,420
Like, you don't even have European Extreme unlocked.

332
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,850
Holy cow.

333
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,350
Highest achieved title is... wait, this one...

334
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,470
Foxhound, yeah, Fox.

335
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,190
Is he smoke in there?

336
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,990
Snake starts with the easy gun.

337
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,770
A silent tranquilizer gun with infinite ammo!

338
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,350
Oh my gosh.

339
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,630
Wow, infinite ammo.

340
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,650
Funny.

341
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,090
Okay.

342
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:22,990
That one's easy.

343
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,590
Let's see.

344
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,830
View all tips.

345
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,970
Important tips.

pop-up tips display only tips that do not interrupt gameplay hide tips

347
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:54,470
easy baby mode what is hero extreme that's one where like if you get any if you get if you get caught at all you die no

348
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,470
I feel like I'm gonna want reminders on how to different controls, so I'm gonna do view all tips.

349
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,790
Correct, yeah.

350
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:13,430
So permadeath, no, it, yeah, it's really get spotted.

351
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,770
You have to, it's ultimate stealth mode.

352
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,410
If you're spotted, it's immediate game over.

353
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,710
Oh, war has changed, is the?

354
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:29,670
After the end of World War II, the world was split into two, east and west.

355
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,890
This marked the beginning of the era

356
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,260
Based on Metal Gear Solid 3.

357
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,400
Wait, we're gonna see the new intro then.

358
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,020
Josh, Keaton!

359
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,460

Oh, gosh.

361
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,020
Oh, gosh.

362
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,760
I've met so many of these people this past weekend.

363
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,420
It's crazy.

364
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,880
So many!

365
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,840
Fly over Pakistan.

366
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,280
Altitude 30,000 feet.

367
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,260
Approaching Soviet airspace.

368
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,440
20 minutes to drop off.

369
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,120
Carrying internal depressurization.

370
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,360
Equipment check.

371
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,960
Paramedic looks so cute.

372
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh my god!

373
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,320
She's beautiful!

374
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,460
God!

375
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,820
She looks so pretty.

376
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,080
She could be in Final Fantasy.

377
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,720
Gosh!

378
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
There he is, guys.

379
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,980
He's in the credits.

380
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,020
Everyone can shut up.

381
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,500
There's Tomokazu Fukushima.

382
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,340
He's in the credits.

383
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,410
You can all shut up.

384
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,680
Put out that cigar.

385
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Connecting oxygen hose to interior connector.

386
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,620
Put on your mask.

387
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,140
Put on your mask.

388
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,420
Oh my gosh.

389
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,800
Thanks, Johnny's combat.

390
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,100
Does this panty waste know what he's doing?

391
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,400
Approaching release point.

392
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:55,720
minutes to drop off hey are you deaf he said put out the cigar and put on your mask sorry zero I had a crush on paramedic before but wow she's really beautiful deep pressurization complete checking oxygen supply six minutes to drop off opening rear hatch I also skipped all the cutscenes when I last played in New York.

393
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,160
So, this is all kind of new to me, too.

394
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,420
Yeah, we were timed.

395
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,800
And I also just wanted to see us a lot.

396
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,000
God, it looks so...

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,380
So good!

398
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,940
Holy hell.

399
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,760
It was first Halo jump!

400
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,340
Gosh, and this is not Ultra graphics either.

401
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,760
I did change it to high.

402
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,380
Your

403
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,650
wings and fly!

404
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,370
Yeah, this is high graphics.

405
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,450
Not Ultra.

406
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,830
Oh my god.

407
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,710
Did you guys see the intro video that we made for MGSCon?

408
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,410
Look at that.

409
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,710
Jack, I've got some important news.

410
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,710
The head of the CIA has finally given us the green light for the virtuous mission.

411
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,870
Virtual mission?

412
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,650
Virtual mission.

413
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,170
No, the virtuous mission.

414
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,530
The future of our fogs.

415
00:30:32,550 --> 00:31:03,630
unit depends on it if it succeeds will be officially organized into a unit virtuous mission sounds like some kind of initiation ritual don't get cocky this isn't a training oh no I can't shut up I'm so sorry well about two years ago a certain Soviet scientist requested asylum in the West through one of our moles scenes will be changed his name is Nikolai Stepanovich Soviet Sokolov.

416
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,510
He's head of the OKB754 designer.

417
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,310
The real footage.

418
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,130
Because I think they had to change some, right?

419
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,850
And the East's foremost expert on weapons development.

420
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,390
Sokolov.

421
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,730
Wait, are we gonna see Sokolov's ugly wife?

422
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,110
Wait, in...

423
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,490
In...

424
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,610
In high-deaf, I need to see her.

425
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,930
Oh my gosh, I can't...

426
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,170
It's so...

427
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,570
The Earth was blue, but there was no God.

428
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,090
Well spoken.

429
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,690
Oh my god, it's so grainy.

430
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,370
It's even worse.

431
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,030
Sokolov is said to be the man most responsible for the multi-engine cluster used.

432
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,110
But they get David Hader back.

433
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,370
Yeah, this is all actually the original cast because it's the original lines.

434
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,590
Sokolov left rocket development to become the head of the newly established design bureau.

435
00:31:52,750 --> 00:32:00,370
And Konami has been really great about working with David Hader and the cast to kind of be promoting the game and everything.

436
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,910
It seems she's become afraid of his own creations.

437
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:29,550
afraid call it a crisis of conscience and for that he left his country and went over the fence not exactly I thought these pictures would look better in this version we used a mole to get the family out first yeah it's original audio circle off over the Berlin Wall shortly afterwards I imagine only re I was the one who because they I think they said that they re-recorded some things and Imagine that's only,

438
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,610
like, control stuff.

439
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,610
But the story is all the same, same, same.

440
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,730
But the whole ordeal had left him exhausted.

441
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,170
And we checked him into a hospital in West Berlin.

442
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,330
It took him two weeks and more than 600 miles to get from the research facility in the Soviet Union to Berlin.

443
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,850
He was in no condition to say anything coherent.

444
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,190
I can't even tell what it is.

445
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,050
Real people!

446
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,970
October 16th, 2016.

447
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,470
too.

448
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:05,390
President Kennedy received word that the Soviets were in the process of deploying intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba.

449
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,570
Old footage went in 4K.

450
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,790
The same time he announced a naval blockade to prevent further missile shipments from being in Cuba.

451
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,630
I can't even read anything.

452
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,170
But the Soviets didn't back down.

453
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:18,410
I'm blind.

454
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,830
Instead, placing their armed forces on secondary alert.

455
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,750
Soviet transport ships carrying missiles continued on course if you squint.

456
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,570
Not even.

457
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,730
The U.S.

458
00:33:25,810 --> 00:34:30,690
and Soviet forces went on alert for an all-out nuclear war frantic negotiations were conducted through the u.n's emergency security kennedy and unofficial jfk to end the hair trigger stand on finally you got the real jfk to act out the scene yeah yeah and so the world avoided a nuclear holocaust but in order to get the so can anyone read lips we had to make a deal you you need the one where the u.s agreed to remove its irbms from turkey no the jupiter irbm deployed in Turkey were obsolete and we were gonna get rid of them anyway they had no strategic value whatsoever to either the US or the Russians the Turkey deal was a roof saying I love a cover story that was fed to the other intelligence agencies around the world so what did the Russians really want so I want to see Sokolov's ugly wife the Soviets pulled out of Cuba just to get their hands on Sokolov that's right what the hell was he working on At the time we had no idea.

459
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,650
We were running out of time.

460
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,250
It was either give up Sokolov or risk full-scale nuclear war.

461
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,970
In the end, we had no choice.

462
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,350
President Kennedy gave him...

463
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,130
Stop calling her ugly.

464
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,510
Okay, but once you see her, you all understand.

465
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,230
She looks like a beast.

466
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,570
Agents on the eastern side.

467
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,310
Oh my god, he's tripping.

468
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,330
I can't tell what's going on in this picture at all.

469
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,130
He's fallen and he can't get up.

470
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,870
We received some new information from one of our moles.

471
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,670
Okay, what is that?

472
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,590
What is that?

473
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,250
He was taken back to the research facility.

474
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:09,930
Broccoli?

475
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,790
Continue working on the weapon in question.

476
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,590
Oh, I think that's the Shagohan.

477
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,530
I can't.

478
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,570
What's more, it's on the verge of completion.

479
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,950
So what kind of weapon is it?

480
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,250
It's the Shagohan.

481
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,670
Something to do with space rockets?

482
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:21,570
No.

483
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,330
Okay, maybe they should have, like, turned off the grain just a tiny bit for this.

484
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,050
I guess you're right.

485
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,130
We don't know the details.

486
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:54,170
but it appears to be a new kind of nuclear device for half a year now the soviets have been conducting frequent nuclear tests at semi-palatinsk it's not a spoiler we know it's a weapon we're talking about a secret weapon so big that khrushchev is ready to pull out of cuba to get it back is sokolov still in a facility how do we know it's old without the grain no according to our intelligence he's in selino yarsk about three miles to the west that's known as the virgin cliffs

487
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:27,890
nice name for a virtuous mission they moved him there just recently why apparently they're conducting a field test of the weapon it's our best chance to get him back this mission would never have been possible in the research facility this is our last chance sokolov must have known that too why did he say that i'm gonna make snake really muddy i'm

488
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,980
gonna make him look like he's

489
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,730
Go, stay cool!

490
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,460
Oh, no, I'm lagging.

491
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,480
So pretty.

492
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,460
Listen up, Jack.

493
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,120
Your mission is to infiltrate City, New York, in the Soviet mountains.

494
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,740
You're sure you saved your Sokolov, but bring it back to the west.

495
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,360
Oh my gosh, wait, that means all the hidden RVs are there!

496
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,100
Oh, yeah!

497
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,540
If we don't get Sokolov back before that weapon is complete, we'll be facing a major crash.

498
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,820
The clock is ticking.

499
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,460
I saw

500
00:37:21,280 --> 00:38:13,620
the logo Once we've confirmed the rescue of Sokolov Stand by at the recovery point A recovery balloon will be dropped at that point Rocklead Helium will be pumped into the balloon to inflate it The process takes about 20 minutes Yummy Once it's complete Gunship's arm will latch onto the balloon and pull it up The Fulton's surface to air recovery system I'm familiar with the Oh Fulton Take it easy It's been combat proven Apparently medic is so pretty do you think so glove is i wish we saw more of her 3d model you know shock will be less than during a parachute you see it here and then at the very end of the game and that's it why was that guy looking at her like that walmart kai is a hero miller over there she's equipped with two six barrel 20 millimeter vulcan cannons as well as two 40 millimeter machine guns sounds like she could hold her own against a battalion of tanks she's so pretty

501
00:38:17,660 --> 00:39:00,480
all goes well it shouldn't take more than a few hours home in time for dinner but if anything goes wrong you'll be eating dinner breakfast and all the rest of your meals in the jungle they all are guys i've talked about this with friends before but like metal gear is just completely full of attractive people it's literally made for everybody anybody and anybody in this game is attractive they're all so handsome and beautiful i can't get over it i oh i did turn off motion blur so just letting the guys know oh my stuff my stuff

502
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,640
the pose the pose

503
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,630
I clapped when I saw it

504
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:44,160
But I guess because you don't You can't get like the The Rykov Ryden version Just kind of sad

505
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,600
Ah Ah

506
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,870
Okay, so I was holding my breath.

507
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,410
Do you copy?

508
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,210
You're already in enemy territory, and somebody might be listening in.

509
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,770
He's getting real close.

510
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,750
We'll be using codenames to refer to each other.

511
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,230
Your codename for this mission will be naked snake.

512
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,030
I'll be referring to you as snake.

513
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,370
It's kind of like a...

514
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,690
Like, it's really wide over here.

515
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,390
Snake.

516
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,030

So this is how I changed my camouflage.

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,670
And then this is the pause.

00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,880
I want to see a little critter.

00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,600
Oh, it's so pretty.

557
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,420
Stand tall.

Ribbit.

559
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,680

00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,020
I hear a frog.

561
00:45:59,260 --> 00:45:59,500
Ribbit.

562
00:45:59,600 --> 00:45:59,880
Ribbit.

Okay, so yeah.

568
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,480
How do I like...

569
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,200
There we go.

570
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:16,560
Okay.

571
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,420
Oh no!

572
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,900
I got him all dirty!

573
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,480
Oh my god!

574
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,920
Oh, but that, not always.

575
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,040
Stop!

576
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,700
That's so good!

577
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,300
What?

578
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,360
Oh my gosh!

579
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,880
What is this?

580
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,780
What does X do?

581
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,940
Okay, I don't know.

582
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,600
Sorry, I'm like just messing around right now.

583
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,120
He's all dirty!

584
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,320
Remember the basics of CQC.

585
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,060
Yes, boss.

586
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,560
There's our stuff.

587
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,600
Oh, it's iconic.

588
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,780
Wait, I want a picture.

589
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,830
I want a picture.

590
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,550
One moment.

591
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,750
Please.

592
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,260
Snake looks a little...

593
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,260
There's nothing going on behind those eyes at all.

594
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,900
There's nothing going...

595
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,180
Wait, I kind of want it from the back.

596
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,880
Wait, turn around, snakes.

597
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,000
I want him, like, looking at it.

598
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,680
I'm looking a little less stupid.

599
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,540
Let's see.

600
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,500
Wait.

601
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,080
He's not looking at it at all.

602
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,060
Snakes!

603
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,700
I won't do this all the time, by the way.

604
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,400
Don't worry.

605
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:56,980
Oh, and...

606
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,540
Oh, cool.

607
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,180
Whoa.

608
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,000
Whoa.

609
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,720
Wait, where am I?

610
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,320
Backshot.

611
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

612
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,540
I'll just filter.

613
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,080
It's so iconic.

614
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,620
I have to take a picture.

615
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,100
Maybe.

616
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:24,840
Yeah.

617
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,460
Okay, how do I take it?

618
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,160
Cheese!

619
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,420
How do I take the picture?

620
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,000
Um, booty shot, booty shot.

621
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,960
Oh, I take the picture.

622
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,160
F12.

623
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,840
Oh!

624
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,360
I hope my cursor didn't get in there.

625
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,160
Uh-oh.

626
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,220
Am I in the game still?

627
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,560
Okay.

628
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,490
Okie dokie, okie dokie.

629
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,130
Climbing the ladder.

630
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,830
Not the tree.

631
00:49:09,290 --> 00:50:27,390
Alt F4 True Hey Over Over I like how the movie borders Show up when it's time for a cutscene I see you've retrieved your backpack, Snake To equip a weapon It's necessary to take it out of your backpack in the survival viewer the letterbox from the backpack your available weapons will be displayed in a list on the screen from that list choose the weapon you want to equip and press the enter button for other equipped items just do the same thing from item got it use the survival viewer backpack yep that's right survival is fundamental to this mission after you've been out in the field for a while your stamina will start to drop if your stamina gets too low it'll affect you won't be able to shoot accurately for example and your wounds will heal as smoothly keep an eye on your stamina so you don't run out to recover lost stamina you can hunt for local flora and fauna yeah you can use either your tranquilizer gun or your knife to hunt my only weapon is a mark 22 hush puppy tranquilizer gun

632
00:50:27,390 --> 00:51:07,350
that's right it's been fitted with its own suppressor however the suppressor will deteriorate every time I'm chewing gum I'm chewing oatmeal it's my will be gone so don't get too trigger happy with it the suppressor's durability is shown in the icon any weapons and equipment beyond what you're carrying now you'll have to find as you go i have to find my own weapons and equipment whose crazy idea was this anyway solo covert actions are standard fox operating procedure you can't leave any traces of your presence no weapons equipment footprints sweat or bodily wastes the same goes for bullets and too.

633
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,830
Your presence in enemy territory is already a violation of international conventions of warfare.

634
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,890
There aren't supposed to be any American soldiers in Russia.

635
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,890
It could spark an international incident.

636
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,090
You can't let anyone see you.

637
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,110
You can't let the enemy know you're there.

638
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,790
This is a stealth mission.

639
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,130
You're a ghost snake in every sense of the word.

640
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,490
There will be no rescue if you're captured.

641
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,690
The military and US government will deny any involvement in your action.

642
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,870
Then I'll just have to take care of myself, huh?

643
00:51:37,450 --> 00:52:37,710
I'm afraid so I've been given a fake death pill for that purpose SIS guidelines stipulate that soldiers on covert ops like this one for the issue of potassium cyanide capsule just like me for real how generous of you use it if you're taken prisoner by the enemy oh yeah state of false death for a short time fooling them into thinking that I'm really dead so how do I come back to life just take the revival pill you mean that they put in my tooth before the mission that's the one but be careful if you remain in a state of false death for too long nothing will be able to bring you back whoa it was freaking i'll keep it in mind become a real death you said this was a solo mission right right i guess that means i can't count on any time paradox correct the mission rests entirely in your hands a real one-man army relax there's a support team ready to back you up over the radio pill eater Listen to you.

644
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,670
This time, survival is of utmost importance.

645
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:44,970
The first member of the support team will be in charge of monitoring your physical condition.

646
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,210
Traces almost as if he's...

647
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,810
As well as recording your mission data.

648
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,710
He's a member of Fox as well, and she's here on the gunship with me.

649
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,150
Hello, Snake.

650
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:57,050
I'm Paramedic.

651
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:57,870
Nice to meet you.

652
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,210
Oh.

653
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,090
Paramedic.

654
00:52:59,290 --> 00:52:59,830
My God.

655
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,870
As in a medic who comes in by parachute.

656
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,230
Aren't you going to tell me your name?

657
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,310
Paramedic's voice actress.

658
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,190
Are you going to tell me yours, Mr. Snake?

659
00:53:06,930 --> 00:54:15,910
my name is the sweetest it's john doe and they call you jack for short you're a regular captain nemo she was so a name means nothing on the battlefield after a week no one has a name i'll talk about it what's your name i know this is like the longest cut scene but very funny i wasn't joking but i'll tell you my name only if you manage to make it back alive my frequency is 145.73 she's also in charge of recording your mission data whenever you want to save send a message over the save frequency 140.96 so saving lets me record my mission data that's right it also records the state of your health good to know there's one more person I want to introduce I was trying to look at her let me see the lady of snakes you remember the boss don't you a legendary soldier and your mentor actually it was the boss that got the DCI's authorization in the first place she's going to be boss is she also helped me plan this mission she and i were at sas together jack is that you how many years has it been

660
00:54:15,910 --> 00:55:06,510
boss that's right it's me oh talk to me let me hear your voice it's been five years 72 days and 18 hours you've lost weight you can tell just by the sound of my voice of course I can I know all about you really well I don't know anything about you what's that supposed to mean why'd you disappear on me all of a sudden I was on a top secret mission you didn't need me anymore but there were still so many things I wanted you to teach me I don't know what it is about the boss I taught you everything you needed to know about fighting but her voice is so I thought makes me so emotional the rest you needed to learn on the whale and sponge.

661
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,590
Techniques sure, but what about how to think like a soldier?

662
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,750
How to think like a soldier?

663
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,390
I can't teach you that.

664
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:21,290
A soldier needs to be strong in spirit, body, and technique, and the only thing you can learn from someone else is technique.

665
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,290
In fact, technique doesn't even matter what's most important is spirit.

666
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,810
Spirit and body are like two sides of a single coin.

667
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,230
They're the same thing.

668
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,370
I can't teach you how to think.

669
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,330
You'll just have to figure it out for yourself.

670
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:37,830
Listen to me, Jack.

671
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:43,250
Just because soldiers are on the same side right now, doesn't mean they always will be.

672
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,430
Having personal feelings about your comrades is one of the worst sins you can commit.

673
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,390
Politics determine who you face on the battlefield.

674
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,970
And politics are a living thing.

675
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,370
They change along with the times.

676
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,330
Yesterday's good might be tomorrow's evil.

677
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,330
Is that why you abandoned me?

678
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,810
No, it had nothing to do with you.

679
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,770
I've I already told you, Jack, I was on a top-secret mission.

680
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,050
A soldier has to follow whatever orders he's given.

681
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:13,450
It's not his place to question why.

682
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,010
But you're looking for a reason to fight.

683
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,290
You're a natural-born fighter, but you're not quite a soldier.

684
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,130
A soldier is a political tool, nothing more.

685
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,830
That's doubly true if he's a career soldier.

686
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,910
Right and wrong have no place in his mission.

687
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,370
He has no enemies and no friends.

688
00:56:32,870 --> 00:57:05,770
only the mission you follow the orders you're given that's what being watching this game oh my goodness I do whatever I have to to get the job you're in for such a ride I don't think about politics that's not the same thing sooner or later your conscience is going to bother you in the end you have to choose whether you're going to live as a soldier or just another man with a gun there's a saying in the Orient loyalty to the end do you know what it means being patient It means devoting yourself to your country.

689
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,250
I follow the president and the top brass.

690
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,510
I'm ready to die for them if necessary.

691
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,890
The president and the top brass won't be there forever.

692
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,210
Once their terms are up, others will take their place.

693
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,970
I follow the will of the leader, no matter who's in charge.

694
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,630
People aren't the ones who dictate the missions.

695
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,130
Then who does?

696
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,370
The times.

697
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,090
People's values change over time.

698
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,250
And so do the leaders of a country.

699
00:57:31,250 --> 00:58:40,350
so there's no such thing as an enemy in absolute terms the enemies we fight are only enemies in relative terms constantly changing with the times as long as we have loyalty to the end there's no point in believing in anything even in those we love and that's the way a soldier supposed to think sounds like they put more of a filter on her voice with absolute certainty sounds like she's more like radio like you know all right but do me a favor it call me snake snake oh right your code name is snake it suits you well oh that's right the legendary unit that the boss put together during World War two was a snake the Cobra unit a group of heroes that brought the water I hear it now more on on zero a major time to backing you up you'll be fine isn't that right snake yeah yeah they added a radio filter to all yeah except snake oh and one more thing boss yes it's good to hear your voice again same here she's so pretty oh my god if either of us will make it out alive snake you are always best at

700
00:58:40,350 --> 00:59:27,610
urban warfare and infiltrating buildings but this is the jungle survival is going to be key those cqc techniques i taught you are sure to come in handy cqc close quarters combat huh i've been in the green braids for the past few not to worry I'll be here to help you remember the basics after all this is your first actual survival mission I'll be supporting you over the radio where are you boss next to the major the boss is communicating with us by radio from a board of permit class submarine in the Arctic Ocean my frequency is 141.80 call me if you need my advice on battle techniques gotcha gotcha your mission is to retrieve Dr. Sokolov.

701
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:29,090
Okay.

702
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:33,170
Dr. Sokolov is being held in an abandoned factory located to the north of your current position.

703
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,730
I can't see that low location.

704
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,610
Avoid heavy combat and don't let anyone see you.

705
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,090
Don't forget that this is a stealth mission.

706
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,330
Okay.

707
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:48,170
Snake, try to remember some of the basics of CQC.

708
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,180
Oh, say the line.

709
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,720
Say the line, Snake.

710
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,650
Say the line!

711
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,250
Commencing virtuous mission now.

712
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,890
She said the line.

713
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,710
She said the line.

714
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,970
We're all saying lines.

715
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,450
Open survival viewer.

716
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,190
We got our camo.

717
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,130
You can wear camouflage to blend in with your environment.

718
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,550
Wait, where was he?

719
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,810
Where was the camo?

720
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:38,630
Oh, wait.

721
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,130
Wearing it allows you to use grenades.

722
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,470
It is.

723
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:46,910
Oh.

724
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:52,070
It is limitless grenade.

725
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,290
No, stinking way.

726
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:12,550
Oh, wait.

727
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:13,630
Oh, my God.

728
01:01:15,530 --> 01:02:09,740

01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,440
even look at it if I can't Oh, I kept it on!

731
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,820
No, no, no, no, no, no!

732
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,000
There we go.

733
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:47,600
Oh!

734
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,040
Let's see.

735
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,260
Um...

736
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:52,900
Cold.

737
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,140
Oh, you can't do CQC in the white talks.

738
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,700
Let's do the crocsuit.

739
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,980
It's so funny.

740
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,440
Oh my god!

741
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,520
Oh!

742
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,740
Big snike.

743
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,660
Wait, where's that guy just chilling out here?

744
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,660
Don't attack me, right?

745
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:18,770
Snake G.

746
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,270
Capture any animal alive.

747
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,490
Can I keep it?

748
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:26,250
Okay, wait.

749
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,510
How do I change?

750
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:28,290
Okay, here we go.

751
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:29,970
So like this.

752
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,730
All right, all right, all right, all right.

753
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,330
Okay, okay.

754
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:34,930
Like that.

755
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,550
Oh, I'm going to move over.

756
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,770
A tad slight.

757
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:38,350
Oh!

758
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:40,970
Sorry.

759
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,290
A tad slight more.

760
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,670
I'm going to make myself a little bit smaller.

761
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:45,890
Sorry.

762
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,950
you guys to see the UI as much as possible.

763
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,770
I'm being bogged by slow connection.

764
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:55,670
Hi, Barry!

765
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:58,770
Okay.

766
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:00,730
There we go.

767
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,490
Okay.

768
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,750
Hi, Barry!

769
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,910
Barry, look at me.

770
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,230
Oh, he's huge!

771
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:13,910
Look at him!

772
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,250
He's ginormous!

773
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,950
He is the biggest guy I've ever seen in my life!

774
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:20,610
Afterlife!

775
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,410
Holy...

776
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,010
Okay, wait.

777
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,310
Oh, achieve a camo index of 90% or higher.

778
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:26,750
That's fun.

779
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,830
Wait, how do I...

780
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,790
How do I...

781
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,710
How do I attack?

782
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,350
How do I attack with it?

783
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,510
Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.

784
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,190
This game is so pretty.

785
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,250
Look at the details.

786
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,990
Again.

787
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,990
This is not...

788
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,590
Hello?

789
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:45,830
Oh, here we go.

790
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:46,090
Oh, I have to...

791
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:46,850
I have to, okay, okay.

792
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,890
This is not ultra quality.

793
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,030
This is just high quality.

794
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,830
Wait, you could hear the croc suit, like the rubber.

795
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,030
Do you hear it?

796
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,250
He's so, he's like squeaky.

797
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,510
No croc head?

798
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,430
We gotta, we gotta go get that.

799
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,370
What are you talking about?

800
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,950
You never start with the croc head.

801
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,130
You gotta go get it.

802
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,690
Okay, so radio.

803
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,330
Yes, I forgot this was a thing.

804
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:24,590
Wait.

805
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,130
Boss.

806
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,730
Oh, I'm in the croc suit.

807
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:37,850
Camouflage is an indispensable tool when you're sneaking through the jungle.

808
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:38,370
No!

809
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:43,910
To use camouflage, first press the survival viewer button to go to the survival viewer.

810
01:05:46,110 --> 01:06:17,130
and press the enter button select a uniform to select battle fatigue and face to select face paint choose battle fatigues that match the surrounding environment oh my god he's got his little claw in there by selecting fatigues that blend in with the no way camouflage patterns that stand out in your surroundings will attract attention it's so funny um what's called paramedic I I see you've captured a giant anaconda.

811
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,410
The giant anaconda is believed to be the largest snake in the world in terms of...

812
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,750
I want him to give me a backscratch.

813
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:26,610
It's not poisonous, but its large size makes it extremely powerful.

814
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,750
They say it even with crocodiles.

815
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,350
Its only natural predator is man.

816
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,510
And snake.

817
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:33,750
And snake.

818
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,210
I love this one.

819
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,410
So how does it taste?

820
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,830
I knew you were going to ask me that.

821
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,710
Glad I didn't disappoint you.

822
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,930
So...

823
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,550
Well, the guide says it tastes all right.

824
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:45,230
Good.

825
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,450
I'll have to try some.

826
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:48,410
Oh,

827
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,160
gosh.

828
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:55,420
Oh, gosh.

829
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,440
Oh, you can, like, quick save.

830
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,280
That's kind of fun.

831
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,520
There's, like, X to save.

832
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,700
Wait, if I do this.

833
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,320
Oh, wow, yeah, yeah.

834
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,800
Oh, so fast!

835
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:10,960
Xenophile!

836
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,420
Listen to paramedic talk about movies after you say it.

837
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:13,960
You haven't seen it?

838
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,680
Nope.

839
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,300
It's about this monster called Godzilla.

840
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,320
It looks just like us.

841
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,040
It's an enormous size in a nuclear test and goes on a rampage in Tokyo.

842
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,740
Movie talk, baby!

843
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,600
That Marshall Islands must be crawling with giant monsters right about now.

844
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,400
It's just make-believe.

845
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,180
Maybe that's why my pants have been so tight lately.

846
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,820
Snake, it's a movie, not a report out of Los Alamos.

847
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,140
I know.

848
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,160
So then what happened?

849
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:38,700
Why did he say that?

850
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,140
Godzilla is immune to all weapons and humanity has no way to stop the monster.

851
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,600
Dr. Sira-zawa developed a new type of weapon.

852
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:52,580
But meanwhile, Godzilla is getting closer and closer to Tokyo, obliterating everything in his path.

853
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,140
Why does it say that?

854
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,960
I recommend seeing the original Japanese one if you ever get the chance.

855
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,000
It's mostly mindless fun, but it's also got a serious anti-nuke message as well.

856
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,580
Where can I see the original?

857
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,660
You'll just have to go to Japan.

858
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,540
Really?

859
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:11,940
That's too bad.

860
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,660
might be able to see it in America too.

861
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,060
That's so cute.

862
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,300
It might even win awards all across the globe in 60 years.

863
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,300
Why is that?

864
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,940
2024 will be Godzilla's 70th birthday.

865
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,980
You think they're still going to be making Godzilla movies then?

866
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:27,380
Wait!

867
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,100
Of course.

868
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:28,780
Last year!

869
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,700
Everybody loves Godzilla.

870
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,160
You sure know a lot about movies.

871
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,300
I don't suppose you're the movie watching type, are you?

872
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,300
Not really.

873
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,320
How did you know?

874
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,040
Then I'll tell you everything I know.

875
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,120
When the going- New lion!

876
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,540
Movies can save your life.

877
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,940
Oh, I was going to say about that.

878
01:08:43,960 --> 01:09:14,200
paramedic to look at things from a different perspective when you get in a jam that's so cool wait they updated it to say 2024 that's the spirit that's so stinking cute that is such a cute attention to detail that is actually so so stinking cute oh my gosh um i wanted to say about paramedic because she was at the voice actress for paramedic was at mgs con i believe her Sorry,

879
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,340
I'm bad with last name.

880
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:27,080
I'm bad with names, but it was her first ever convention ever ever and she was so, oh my gosh, she was so, she was like crying.

881
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,880
She was so grateful to, to be there.

882
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,720
Heather Haley, Haley, Haley, Haley?

883
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:34,680
Yeah.

884
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,140
She was so, so sweet.

885
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,680
She was so, so grateful and she loves paramedics.

886
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,940
She loves being paramedics.

887
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:48,240
She would just like say she was so excited.

888
01:09:48,420 --> 01:10:03,160
She was just like I would watch old movies just like Paramedic and be like wow this movie is so much like Paramedic story and like she oh my gosh listening to her was infectious because she was so happy about the role.

889
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,280
It was so she yeah she pretty much was paramedic.

890
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:41,400
She even said she was like she was like it was so fun to have a role that was so similar to me and then she was just she was like obviously i'm not gonna go too much into what she said because it also is spoilers but she was like going off about like paramedic's lore and what paramedic goes on to do and future games and i was just so impressed i was so impressed that she like you know knew so much about the character she was so enthralled with the role It was such a good weekend.

891
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,760
It was such a good weekend.

892
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:47,460
MGSCon is taking a break next year.

893
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:58,800
But I think if you are interested in going and they do one the year after, you should definitely check it out.

894
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,160
Definitely, definitely.

895
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:04,360
Okay.

896
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,520
Here, I want to try something.

897
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,720
I might die.

898
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,560
Oh, hello.

899
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,540
I want to get real nice and dirty.

900
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,800
I want to get real nasty with it.

901
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:18,940
Holy cow.

902
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,360
I want to get nasty.

903
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,020
I'm ready to get disgusted.

904
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:26,460
Come on, Snake.

905
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:27,640
Come on.

906
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,160
Oh, gosh.

907
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:28,700
I might dive.

908
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,920
Oh, crawl, crawl, crawl.

909
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:30,240
Okay.

910
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,240
Wait, maybe this would be good.

911
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,160
Wait.

912
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:34,840
Oh, get up.

913
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:35,960
Oh.

914
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,020
Oh, we're covered in moss.

915
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,720

okay i know how the backpack works well moment, one moment.

919
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,960
This is for science.

920
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,000
Wait, what am I doing?

921
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,860
All up in there.

922
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,580
All up in there.

Wait, oh gosh, oh gosh, don't die.

924
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,340
Oh gosh, keep crawling.

925
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,640
Okay, sorry, I knew, I had a feeling I was gonna die.

926
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,120
I can't wait a second.

927
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,220
Okay, We got this.

928
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,440
We got this.

929
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:11,890
Okay.

930
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,510
Alright.

931
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,650
Okay.

932
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,390
Snake is dead.

933
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,090
Okay, turn around.

934
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:23,090
Oh,

935
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,680
he's filthy!

936
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,480
Oh, he's disgusting!

937
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,180
Ew!

938
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,140
Okay, I'm done.

939
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:51,540
I'm good.

940
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:52,620
I'm calm.

941
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:52,980
I'm cool.

942
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:53,500
I'm collected.

943
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,240
I'm calm.

944
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:57,660
I'm cool.

945
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,240
I'm collected.

946
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Okay.

947
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,220
Oh, the roll.

948
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:02,980
Oh, wait.

949
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:03,540
Oh, yeah, yeah.

950
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,240
Okay, hold on.

951
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,080
Oh.

952
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,000
Get out of there.

953
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,740
Does it work better?

954
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,120
Nah.

955
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,300
We're still nasty.

956
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,360
Still same nast.

957

That's nice.

959
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,160
That's nice.

960
01:14:59,070 --> 01:14:59,670
Oh, jeez.

961
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:00,530
Oh, jeez.

962
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:01,270
Oh, jeez.

963
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:01,770
Oh, jeez.

964
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,030
Come here.

965
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:08,870
There is a Gakko right here.

966
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:09,870
I saw him before.

967
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:17,470
Ugly duckling attack a Gakko for the first time.

968
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,790
I've been forgetting to search for the kerotano.

969
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:21,270
Gakko.

970
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,760
Excuse me.

971
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,560
It's a duck now.

972
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,240
There's both.

973
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:40,760
And it's always been a duck.

974
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,540
Gakko has always been an addition.

975
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:47,960
Oh!

976
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:49,980
No, she's...

977
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,420
My babe.

978
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,320
Get up.

979
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,740
And also, you guys, I don't know if you noticed, but there's crouch walking, which is huge.

980
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:04,060
Yeah, Kero-Tan, you can see here in the bottom right.

981
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,240
You can see Kero-Tan and Gakko.

982
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,280
Oh, and it shows you if you got the guy in that area.

983
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,720
Wait, that's so nice.

984
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,040
Okay, okay.

985
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,820
Gakko is probably going to be so much easier to find than Kero-Tan.

986
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,460
Kep-Tan, I imagine, will be kind of difficult, no?

987
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:33,780
Okay.

988
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,600
Oh!

989
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,530
Prince Charming, attack Akero time for the first time.

990
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,710
Wait, he's circling, it's so cute.

991
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:48,870
Wait, is he the piggy bank?

992
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,970
Oh, he is!

993
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,730
Chibi Minto with the bandana is super cute.

994
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,570
Thank you.

995
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:58,470
They spin!

996
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,650
It's so cute!

997
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,510
Alright, let's go attack some men.

998
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,290
Quero, quero, quero, quero.

999
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,630
You already missed 20.

1000
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:13,850
Oh no, wait, I forgot to change.

1001
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,830
I almost shook my controller.

1002
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:19,870
Like, uh...

1003
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:23,930
You know how in four you can shake the controller to turn off the camo?

1004
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,550
Major, I've spotted two enemy soldiers.

1005
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,150
They're probably KGB troops sent to guard Sokolov.

1006
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:41,730
AK-47s and grenades.

1007
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:43,370
Is this the beehive scene?

1008
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:43,810
No.

1009
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:44,790
Next area.

1010
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:46,690
Don't worry.

1011
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:51,990
Snake, your presence in Soviet territory is already a violation of international law.

1012
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:56,670
We can't let the Kremlin find out that the CIA and the American government are involved.

1013
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,530
Contact with the enemy is strictly prohibited.

1014
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,670
Don't engage them in battle either.

1015
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,770
This is a stealth mission.

1016
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,230
Okay.

1017
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,550
The major is right.

1018
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:10,130
The point of this mission is to sneak through the jungle without being seen.

1019
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:11,890
I just remembered if I killed the bird.

1020
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,930
bunch of guys, the part.

1021
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,930
Oh, oh my gosh, the part, I'm so excited.

1022
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:20,250
Change your camouflage by selecting camouflage from the survival viewer.

1023
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,130
I just remembered.

1024
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,350
The uniform option lets you pick your uniform.

1025
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,550
I'm so excited for spooky.

1026
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:27,230
Oh my god, I'm so excited for spooky.

1027
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,870
It's gonna, oh my gosh, what it's gonna look like.

1028
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:33,710
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1029
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,170
Don't forget that anything that moves will stand out in the jungle.

1030
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:46,450
If you just stand up and run around like an idiot, you're bound to be But if you crawl instead, you should be able to sneak by without being noticed.

1031
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:47,890
I'm a gator.

1032
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:51,090
You can see how effective your camouflage is by looking at the camo index.

1033
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,790
The camo index shows how well your camouflage blends in with the surrounding area.

1034
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:01,610
The higher the value, the harder you are to spot and vice versa.

1035
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:06,310
The key is to make yourself one with nature.

1036
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:07,810
Where is he here?

1037
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,810
I don't see him.

1038
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,810
In that little clip, I don't see him at all.

1039
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,910
I like the, I actually really like the, what's it called, music though.

1040
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,050
Oh,

1041
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:30,290
okay, there we go.

1042
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,630
Oops.

1043
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,370
He's fine.

1044
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,010
Okay, hold on.

1045
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:38,790
Oh, my controller.

1046
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,510
My bad.

1047
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:50,050
The caution music, that's what I'm saying.

1048
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:54,990
My camel's not really great right now, but I'm an alligator, so I don't...

1049
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:55,350
Oops.

1050
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:57,830
Oh, don't call anybody, please.

1051
01:19:59,170 --> 01:19:59,750
Oh, gosh.

1052
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,940
There he goes.

1053
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,640
Oh, you can see the...

1054
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,560
Oh, wow.

1055
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,600
Sorry, I'm, like, just looking at it.

1056
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:20,440
You can see, like, the drop-off.

1057
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,400
That's kind of crazy.

1058
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,040
Trank has bullet drop.

1059
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,960
Yeah, you can see it.

1060
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,680
Wait, that's so nice.

1061
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,520
Wait, that's cool.

1062
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,460
I didn't know that.

1063
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,600
Oh, wait, I want to drag him.

1064
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:44,780
Oops.

1065
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,180
Wait.

1066
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:57,220
press up but I can't change my camo so I guess it's only maybe when you're not in caught okay we're test we're testing everything you guys we're testing it all right now

1067
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:27,850

1068
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,770
There you go.

1069
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,110
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

1070
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:35,250
Where'd he go?

1071
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:36,770
Oh, there he is.

1072
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,850
Do I have to be...

1073
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,060
Oh, oops.

1074
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:47,780
Freeze!

1075
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:48,360
Ah!

1076
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,180
We're already starting.

1077
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,000
This is so good.

1078
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:56,980
Oh!

1079
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,400
That feels good.

1080
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,840
Wait, that feels so good.

1081
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,040
We're fine.

1082
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:02,860
Everything's cool.

1083
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:03,980
And calm and collected.

1084
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:04,900
Nice hold up.

1085
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,700
I pressed the wrong button.

1086
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,720
It feels so smooth.

1087
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,160
Wait, do I have to hold X?

1088
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,940
Ah, okay, here we go, okay.

1089
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,100
It's quite nice.

1090
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,320
Oh, okay, I reload it.

1091
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,480
Okay, that's to reload.

1092
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,520
Got it.

1093
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,180
Hello.

1094
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,680
Kick him awake.

1095
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:46,560
I wonder if any of them have a secret theater.

1096
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:51,940
How do I kick them?

1097
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,920
Something's never changed.

1098
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,160
Yeah, the CQC is definitely closer to five.

1099
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,140
Definitely for sure.

1100
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,940
Look at, you can see the track in the middle of it.

1101
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,360
That's crazy.

1102
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,040
That's so funny.

1103
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,180
Okay.

1104
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,660
I see

1105
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,900
my suppressor running out.

1106
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:28,680
Scaring me.

1107
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:33,350
All right.

1108
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,650
Let's go get...

1109
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:35,970
Let's go get Sokolov.

1110
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,150
Oh, wait.

1111
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,670
No, sorry.

1112
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,450
We have one more scene.

1113
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,070
Oh, my gosh.

1114
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,650
The bridge.

1115
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,650
I'm stupid.

1116
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,080
Hit CQC three times.

1117
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,460
Oh, here it is!

1118
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:59,180
Here it is!

1119
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:03,750
Oh,

1120
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,100
this is a little shit-eating grin.

1121
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,820
Should I wait for the other guys to come?

1122
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:19,960
Hmm.

1123
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,980
Evil thoughts.

1124
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,120
Since there's three of them.

1125
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,100
I wonder if they'll all run away together.

1126
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,260
Use bees to harass an enemy.

1127
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
Oh, shoot.

1128
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,260
Oh, my gosh.

1129
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,580
The drop off is kind of crazy.

1130
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:50,220
Oh, my gosh.

1131
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,520
The drop off is crazy.

1132
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,560
Here they go!

1133
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,220
Not the bees!

1134
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,960
I'm gonna run out of bullets.

1135
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,380
Oh, I suck.

1136
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,400
Holy hell.

1137
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,820
Like, here?

1138
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,160
Okay, I give up.

1139
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,330
I suck, you guys.

1140
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,850
Okay, I also really suck at this bridge.

1141
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,390
Just fair warning to you all.

1142
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,370
I'm really bad at this bridge.

1143
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,470
Hello?

1144
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,250
Why can't I get him?

1145
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,910
There we go.

1146
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:29,990
Jeez.

1147
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,450
Okay.

1148
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,350
Alright, I'm gonna be fine.

1149
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:37,650
Wait, am I actually gonna be fine?

1150
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:43,210
I fell off this freaking thing like 10 times last time I played.

1151
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,590
Are you kidding me?

1152
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:45,990
I did it first try.

1153
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:46,730
Keep going, Snake.

1154
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:53,570
I really did fall off so many times last time.

1155
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:55,630
Ow!

1156
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,980
No, I'm even in New York.

1157
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,480
Wait, no, go up.

1158
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,960
I'm doing pull-ups again.

1159
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:10,980
Climb.

1160
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:11,900
There we go.

1161
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,400
What is this, too?

1162
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:30,940

1164
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,700
it's so easy to see him kettotan is so difficult

1165
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,780

1166
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:21,290

it's okay we're trying out oh come on shake come on give me

1168
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:47,900
okay let's just go To Sokolov, I zoomed through all of this before when I played in New York.

1169
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:51,540
So I'm honestly just getting my fill of it now.

1170
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:01,520
It did sound like the suppressor broke, but it showed it there, so I don't think so.

1171
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:02,780
No gako.

1172
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,360
It's okay.

1173
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,360
I'm not trying to get all of them.

1174
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,540
Major, I've reached the abandoned factory where Sokolov is supposedly being held.

1175
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,460
This place is a dump.

1176
01:28:18,600 --> 01:29:19,360
let's place it with a jump you can crouch walk now I can't see Sokolov from here just like in MGS 3 3d there are sentries posted around the perimeter look at him it's a man your objective Sokolov is inside the factory they should be holding him in a room in the northeast section northeast section got it be careful your mission is to bring Sokolov back alive security is pretty tight and blind I don't know how they didn't see me not approach Sokolov while in the alert phase right I got I got only a lot you mean there's more not my peace worker shirt no when you get to Sokolov I want you to tell him something from me and that is sorry for being so late is that all yes understood beginning my approach to the target.

1177
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,340
I'm making a mess of myself.

1178
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,920
I'm making an absolute mess of myself.

1179
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,980
That explains, oh.

1180
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:39,400
That explains though, because when I was playing this, when I was playing this, I was, the drop off I mean, I was like kind of oops.

1181
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,560
Oopsie.

1182
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:43,700
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

1183
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:44,600
Ouch.

1184
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,120
There we go.

1185
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,180
I was, like, struggling with some of the shots.

1186
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,380
Actually, I still am.

1187
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,500
Nothing has changed.

1188
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,320
Like, I can't get the...

1189
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,280
Maybe there's still drop-off, but you can't see it.

1190
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:05,460
Okay.

1191
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,520
I have five suppressors.

1192
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,420
Now I look at it.

1193
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,440
I think we're okay.

1194
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,800
Gotta get used to that drop- I know.

1195
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,680
My goodness.

1196
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,520
That's gonna take me a second.

1197
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:17,300
Okay.

1198
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,300
But it's kind of nice that they show you.

1199
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,300
I kind of, I like that still, but.

1200
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:31,600
And what we're going to do here is we're going to equip our MD.

1201
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:32,660
Maybe?

1202
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,800
Motion detector.

1203
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:41,720
Let's see.

1204
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,340
We're on normal mode, normal, normal.

1205
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,240
That's my camo.

1206
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:49,660
Oh, okay.

1207
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,980
I'm not used to the camo being in the bottom middle still.

1208
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:59,040
I keep pressing up to change the quick camo change, but it's not working anymore.

1209
01:30:59,480 --> 01:30:59,920
I don't know what...

1210
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,900
Oh, wrong button.

1211
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:01,260
Sorry.

1212
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,880
I don't know what I did.

1213
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,140
Oh, I got leaves on me.

1214
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,480
I don't know what I did.

1215
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:14,500
I also keep accidentally pressing B because it's circle, you know, in Japan.

1216
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,380
So I'm having to redo all of this even still.

1217
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,660
It does feel...

1218
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,680
It's very familiar and feels like a new experience all at the same time.

1219
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,700
Try holding it.

1220
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,020
Thank you!

1221
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,660
Thank you.

1222
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,660
Oh, it's like...

1223
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:37,880
Why... Wait, they're like quick change, but like...

1224
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,440
Why this combo?

1225
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,740
Why?

1226
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,280
Interesting.

1227
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:47,980
Okay.

1228
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,620
I know there's a guy that goes up there, no?

1229
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,430
Ugh.

1230
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,890
I know where he is.

1231
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:04,370
Sokolov.

1232
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,730
Maybe I can get this guy.

1233
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,830
A little aim, a little up.

1234
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:14,330
Oh, shoot.

1235
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,050
Don't call.

1236
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:18,790
Don't...

1237
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:19,010
Ow!

1238
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,110
Shucks.

1239
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:23,090
I cleared this part so easy before, though.

1240
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:25,270
Down.

1241
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,330
That was pretty good.

1242
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:29,770
Oh, and game!

1243
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,070
Christ is avoided.

1244
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:36,030
I need to get used to this shot.

1245
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:39,250
I need to.

1246
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:43,310
I'm not very good at it.

1247
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:44,650
Oh no.

1248
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,250
Oh no.

1249
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:45,910
Oh no.

1250
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,890
Everybody, I apologize for the ghost that I am about to become.

1251
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,910
I apologize.

1252
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,870
Okay.

1253
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,370
We still have another cutscene, though, before it.

1254
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,630
And we still have this cutscene before.

1255
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,050
Before.

1256
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,150
Okay, we're fine.

1257
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:12,970
Oh, wait.

1258
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:13,950
What?

1259
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:26,070
My ass cheeks are clenched.

1260
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:27,330
Truly.

1261
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,690
You must be Sokolov.

1262
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:31,390
I was about to say, you must be Ames.

1263
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:33,730
Are you one of Vulcan's men?

1264
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:38,290
You'll never get it from me.

1265
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:38,970
No.

1266
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:41,530
I'm a CIA agent.

1267
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:45,730
I've come to escort you back to the other side of the Iron Curtain.

1268
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,590
Your CIA?

1269
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:49,710
Yeah.

1270
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:54,190
I was sent by Major Zero, the man who got you out two years ago.

1271
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:56,990
Zero?

1272
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,750
I have a message from him.

1273
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:02,210
What is it?

1274
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:34,150
he said to tell you sorry for being so late snake looks so good did he now yeah looks so good what does it mean it means he's a man of his word no you've got no time to this you have to get me out of here before they arrive who's they Colonel Vulgan of grew you will know him as Thunderbolt I know him as Volgan.

1275
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,990
Who the hell calls him Thunderbolt?

1276
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:40,230
He's a member of the army's extremist faction.

1277
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:41,630
Who the hell is Thunderbolt?

1278
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:49,650
Ever since the Cuban Missile Crisis two years ago, Khrushchev has been pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence with the West.

1279
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:59,490
Despite resistance and criticism from hawks in the army and the provincial authorities, Khrushchev has managed to suppress the opposition so far.

1280
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:05,070
has put him in a precarious position.

1281
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:09,030
And on top of that, the tragedy last November.

1282
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:11,510
President Kennedy's assassination.

1283
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,170
Dun-dum.

1284
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,350
Precisely.

1285
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:19,790
In a sense, Khrushchev has lost his biggest partner and his power base is rapidly crumbling away.

1286
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:28,510
A certain group is plotting to use this opportunity to seize power by rallying the anti-government forces overflowing Khrushchev.

1287
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:30,850
And installing Brezhnev and Khrushchev in this place.

1288
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:33,270
Oh my god, I can't wait for him to say had enough of your kisses.

1289
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:35,690
The mastermind behind this blood is currently Vulcan of the Groove.

1290
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:47,610
He has control over another secret weapons research facility much like this one, OKB812, known as the Gronin Design Bureau, and is using it to further his plans.

1291
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,330
But that is not enough to satisfy him.

1292
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:56,450
Okay, I can't scream, though, because my voice is still recovering from this weekend, but I'll do it.

1293
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,210
I'll do my best.

1294
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:05,450
My voice is recovering from this whole weekend.

1295
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:07,650
I can't help it.

1296
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:12,590
The intelligence says that they are going to make their move during the test.

1297
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:15,850
And the soldiers outside.

1298
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:20,010
Exactly.

1299
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:24,530
They wouldn't need that many men just to keep me inside.

1300
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,950
It's like a pillow in my mouth.

1301
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:29,870
Their orders were to prevent Colonel Vulcan from capturing me.

1302
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:30,290
Hmm.

1303
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,540
Wormhole so collapsed.

1304
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,100
Yeah.

1305
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,380
We have the technology in nine years.

1306
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:46,340
Vulcan will come.

1307
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,320
I'm sure of it.

1308
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:48,540
You must get me back.

1309
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,000
I'm sure of it too.

1310
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,260
Holy!

1311
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:59,520
By the way, your Russian is superb.

1312
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,160
Where did you learn to speak it?

1313

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1317
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,300
This is so insane to see still.

1318
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,420
I'm still not over this.

1319
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,800
I'm still, I can't believe I'm playing this game right now.

1320
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:25,780
Oh no.

1321
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,680
He's coming.

1322
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,600
He's almost here.

1323
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,400
Thank you, thank you.

1324
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,780
I can't look.

1325
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,720
I don't think I should look.

1326
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,080
But I want to take it all in.

1327
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,120
Oh, I shouldn't look.

1328
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:53,550
No, no.

1329
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,970
No, no.

1330
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:02,210
I'm scared.

1331
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,680
Why is Sokolov moving like that?

1332
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,040
Because he's a silly guy.

1333
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,480
He's a silly Willy.

1334
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:26,230
Oh no, no, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1335
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:27,070
No!

1336
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:31,230
Sorry.

1337
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:37,910
We made it last.

1338
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:42,810
We made it last.

1339
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:45,950
You, you're from the Ocelot unit of Spetsnaz.

1340
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:49,330
That's major to you.

1341
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,050

Don't do it.

Oh,

1348
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:41,560
I can't say it feels good to kill a comrade, even if it is for the grue.

1349
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,380
Sokolov, take cover.

1350
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,640
Sokolov's so bald.

1351
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,420
He's presenting.

1352
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,860
He's fucked.

1353
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:56,400
Oh, no.

1354
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,400
Oh, why does he look at him like that?

1355
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,820
Oh, my God.

1356
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,500

01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,040
He's such a freak.

01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,840

1365
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:02,640
Leave it!

1366
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:03,760
Shoot the other one!

1367
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:04,120
We

1368
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:46,920
need to have more tranquilizer resistance training.

1369
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:49,300
Ha!

1370
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:50,060
Ha!

1371
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:51,780
Ha!

1372
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,340
Ha!

1373
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:52,600
Ha!

1374
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,940
Oh my god!

1375
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,420
His eyes were...

1376
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:06,230
I love him.

1377
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:09,810
Impossible!

1378
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:13,910
You ejected the first bullet by hand, didn't you?

1379
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:16,070
I see what you were trying to do.

1380
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:20,290
But testing a technique you've only heard about in the middle of battle wasn't very smart.

1381
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:23,170
You were asking to have your gun jam on you, huh?

1382
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:26,670
Besides, I don't think you're cut out for an automatic in the first place.

1383
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:29,930
You tend to twist your elbow to absorb the recoil.

1384
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:34,070
That's more of a revolver technique.

1385
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:37,470
You filthy American dog!

1386
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:49,570
My man is not okay.

1387
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,410
But that was some fancy shooting.

1388
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,390
You're pretty good.

1389
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:03,700
Pretty good.

1390
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:14,020
You could see every neuron in his brain activate.

1391
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,840
You can't believe how it's ever...

1392
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,900
Literally the course of his life has just changed.

1393
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,160
You sense to that.

1394
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,380
Major, do you read me?

1395
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,120
I read you.

1396
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:33,120
Young guns stun us a lot.

1397
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,640
I've run into a few snags.

1398
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,120
These guys were after Sokolov too.

1399
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,200
Apparently they were taking orders from the Gru Colonel named Volgan.

1400
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:41,260
I need some water.

1401
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:44,680
Part of an internal Soviet power struggle according to Sokolov.

1402
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,000
I need some water.

1403
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,640
Something between the KGB and Gru.

1404
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,480
Between Khrushchev's supporters and Volgan's.

1405
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,200
Sokolov was being guarded by the KGB and hunted by Gru.

1406
01:45:55,160 --> 01:46:26,040
snake it sounds like this could be even hotter than Cuba I don't worry we'll try the paradox the whole thing stinks I agree you'd better worry we'll try Sokolov ran off by himself but I'll catch up to him we're counting on you hmm I got him I just put a big old glop of chapstick in my mouth oh we got that other gun let's try it oh wait I have to put in my inventory.

1407
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,580
My backpack.

1408
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:36,320
We could blow him up with a grenade.

1409
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,840
We could blow him up.

1410
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:45,660
Let's try that.

1411
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,300
Wait, let me put on the unlimited.

1412
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:49,420
Wait.

1413
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:55,080
Oh, I like it.

1414
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,040
I like it, I like it

1415
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,620
He's real jiggly

1416
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:32,640
One thing I think I'm gonna forget to do in this game though Is do more of the codex So Try not to be too spammy about it But you can remind me, you know You can remind me Sometimes

1417
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,300
Wait, what?

1418
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,160
I'm a genius.

1419
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:40,060
I'm a genius.

1420
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:40,920
I'm a genius.

1421
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:41,760
I'm a genius.

1422
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,660
Oh my god.

1423
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:43,480
Wait, move, snake.

1424
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,360
Move, snake.

1425
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:44,620
Move.

1426
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,260
Okay, hold on.

1427
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:46,540
Wait.

1428
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,800
Put away.

1429
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,440
Now for my final

1430
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:11,100

01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,120

1434
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,410
Oh.

1435
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:04,770
Are those grenades on your outfit?

1436
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:05,510
Yep.

1437
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:06,570
No,

1438
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:10,890
stop.

1439
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:11,350
Stop.

1440
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:11,930
Snake.

1441
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:13,530
Okay, hold on.

1442
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,730
It, from behind it just looks like the...

1443
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,470
He is sparkling!

1444
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:21,310
Oh, because we're clean.

1445
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:23,170
Shut up.

1446
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,150
That's so cute.

1447
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:26,130
We're sparkling clean.

1448
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:31,490
Okay,

1449
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,970
from the back, though, it just looks like the scientist outfit.

1450
01:49:38,510 --> 01:49:39,990
Okay, no, no.

1451
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:42,790
Let's eat some food.

1452
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:46,030
Let's eat our giant Anaconda.

1453
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,300
Tasty.

1454
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,320
Tasty.

1455
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:59,660
Okay, I need, like, the exact correct angle.

1456
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,780
Not in his crotch, please.

1457
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,580
This is family friendly.

1458
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,480
I just want him, like, staring at his face, you know?

1459
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:12,560
I want to really...

1460
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:12,840
Oh, wait.

1461
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:13,860
This is actually even better.

1462
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:15,620
Because he's, like, looking down on him.

1463
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:16,420
Oh, my God.

1464
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:18,420
Okay.

1465
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:19,820
Oh.

1466
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,660
Oh, my gosh.

1467
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:34,830
You take too big of turns, Snake.

1468
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:42,900
Look at his...

1469
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,640
Oh, gosh.

1470
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,280
Oh.

1471
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:47,720
Look at...

1472
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:48,820
Oh.

1473
01:50:55,250 --> 01:51:10,790
I'm not okay I'm not okay okay this should be good all right oops wrong viewer just kidding okay he looks so cute oh oh he looks like he's about to grab him

1474
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,250
okay that doesn't really do anything

1475
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,840
whoa I wish I could change it to night time What's this do?

1476
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,620
Whoa, freaky.

1477
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:34,120
Wow, now I'm just testing all the features.

1478
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,460
That probably made the bitrate go crazy.

1479
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,960
What's the most romantic?

1480
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,400
Maybe this, we'll go with legacy.

1481
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,100
Okay.

1482
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,300
Okay, let's kill him.

1483
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:43,760
Let's kill him, boys.

1484
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:56,660
I let's actually this is good practice for the for it too wait see you think I should save first save?

1485
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:10,820
haki paramedic oh oh wait wait this is the actual save button save in the game snake yes

1486
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,600
Snake, do you know the creature from the Black Lagoon?

1487
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:18,660
Nope, never heard of it.

1488
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:23,180
These scientists are investigating a place deep in the Amazon called the Black Lagoon.

1489
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,400
And they get picked off one after the other by this fishman thing.

1490
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:32,260
And there was this scene when the heroine is going for a swim and the creature sneaks up on her from underwater.

1491
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,740
Yeah, the save is so fast.

1492
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:34,460
I thought my heart was going to stop.

1493
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:40,280
I mean, of course, the 3D effects and It came from outer space were a lot more intense, but...

1494
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:43,600
It wouldn't be referring to you coming from outer space, would it?

1495
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,320
How rude.

1496
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,340
I seem so mean.

1497
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,260
Why do you say that?

1498
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:47,620
Yeah.

1499
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,920
Because no one on Earth could be as charming as you.

1500
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:52,220
Fine.

1501
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,760
I'll just get to the point, Snake.

1502
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:55,140
The Snake rules.

1503
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,060
Ooh, la la.

1504
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:01,940
Just imagining you swimming in those jungle rivers makes me think of you being attacked by a fishman.

1505
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,100
So stinkin' smooth.

1506
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,760
Fishmen aren't the only things that'll attack you in the water.

1507
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:09,640
Really be careful out there.

1508
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,120
Okay.

1509
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:10,640
Okay.

1510
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:14,220
And don't be attacking any pretty girls going for a swim.

1511
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:23,040
him either are you calling me a fish man you started suck enough okay now we kill him

1512
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,760
oh we okay so if you hold it down it does

1513
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:50,220

1514
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,120
Campbell.

1515
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:57,920
So good.

1516
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,700
Series over.

1517
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:05,120
No.

1518
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:05,860
No.

1519
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:09,760
Okay.

1520
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:10,960
Okay.

Bye, Ocelot.

I'll see you again later.

1525
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:51,390
Mwah!

1526
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:53,370
Wait, I'm going to pick him up a little bit.

1527
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:53,750
Oh!

1528
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:54,650
Hello?

1529
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:55,510
Where'd he go?

1530
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:56,310
Wait, where am I?

1531
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,610
Wait, I'm...

1532
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:58,790
Oh, there we go.

01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:00,610
Wait, oh, that's what I'm doing.

1534
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:05,230
Thank you.

1535
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:08,110
Come here.

1536
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:08,930
Come here.

1537
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:09,870
Oh.

1538
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,670
Oh, my God.

1539
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:20,830
He is so ragdolled.

1540
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:39,470
I'm stuck.

1541
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:50,030
He's so floppy.

1542
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:54,170
Okay, I'll put you down now, buddy.

1543
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:59,870
Why is he so floppy?

1544
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:06,070
It's like he's awake or something and he's like, this is how a unconscious man would move.

1545
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:10,930
Kick him.

1546
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:21,660
It is him when I wake up.

1547
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,220
He's having good dreams.

1548
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,300
He's having good dreams.

1549
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:32,480
Okay, before we go to the bridge, did I grab everything in here?

1550
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,220
I can't remember.

1551
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:36,000
Whoop.

1552
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,060
I can't remember if I grabbed everything around here.

1553
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,940
Also, where the heck is Gokko and Kedotan?

1554
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:49,780
Haven't seen them either.

1555
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:50,840
Are they under the house?

1556
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:52,880
Stairs to the room.

1557
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,420
roof.

1558
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,800
That guy's still up here.

1559
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:01,500
We got some birds.

1560
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:01,960
Wait.

1561
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:15,660
Got a birdie.

1562
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,840
That was so dramatic.

1563
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,420
That was so dramatic.

1564
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,910
It was Oh, there's a snake.

1565
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:25,710
And a rat.

1566
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:27,710
Oh my god, look at him scuttle.

1567
01:58:30,190 --> 01:58:32,170
Look at him scuttle away.

1568
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,740
Is this the R rat?

1569
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:44,700
Is this the rat?

1570
01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:49,890
I like the effect.

1571
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:50,870
It's kind of cool.

1572
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:52,470
It's just rat.

1573
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:57,930
I like the way their little legs move though.

1574
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:03,250
Let's go through here.

1575
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,990
I see snakes.

1576
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:09,010
That's a big boy.

1577
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,410
Nobody.

1578
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:16,590
Rat.

1579
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:17,950
Rat.

1580
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:23,740
Now eat them alive.

1581
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,100
Where's my knife?

1582
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:26,520
Come here.

1583
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:31,250
How do I...

1584
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:31,330
Oh.

1585
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:33,630
Actually, how do I use it?

1586
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:36,710
Thank you for the redirect.

1587
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:37,590
Thank you.

1588
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:38,270
Hello, hello.

1589
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:40,470
How do I use this?

1590
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:42,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1591
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:47,890
How's Delta so far?

1592
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:49,370
I love it so far.

1593
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:51,070
Having so much fun.

1594
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:54,410
Touch.

1595
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:57,970
You guys' profile pictures still getting me.

1596
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:04,030
I'm a little laggy, but the game has been great so far.

1597
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:06,730
So I apologize for my leg.

1598
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:09,550
I apologize if I'm wagon.

1599
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:11,550
Hello, stop it.

1600
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:15,330
Where is Kedotan and Gakko, though?

1601
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:17,010
We're searching.

1602
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:19,970
Since I have free rain, I'm so curious.

1603
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,990
Over here?

1604
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:26,550
Oh, where could they be?

1605
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:37,130
Sokolov's room.

1606
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:37,890
Let's check it.

1607
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:41,230
Wait, can I open these lockers?

1608
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:43,250
Oh.

1609
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:48,470
No, I cannot.

1610
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:52,430
You think Ocelot?

1611
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:54,730
Oh my gosh, everything is so glitchy on my side.

1612
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:56,210
Even my notifs are glitchy.

1613
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:57,790
I think I might have to turn them off, you guys.

1614
02:00:57,990 --> 02:00:58,370
I'm sorry.

1615
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:05,930
Not in here.

1616
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:11,890
Huh.

1617
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:17,330
Some tall lockers.

1618
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:18,030
Right?

1619
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:20,050
I was going to say snake is pretty short.

1620
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,530
Well, he's not short, but like, you know.

1621
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:29,810
taller characters in the series than him but these are some crazy tall lockers

1622
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:47,150

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

1628
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:46,750
Kero-Tan, though.

1629
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:48,570
Mysterious.

1630
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:51,250
I mean, uh, wait, no, not Kero-Tan.

1631
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,910
Gaka though.

1632
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:54,470
So mysterious.

1633
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:04,420
Hmm.

1634
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:07,700
Oh well.

1635
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:15,940
Oh wait, how do I put the suppressor?

1636
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:16,580
Yes sir.

1637
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:23,900
Uh...

1638
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:26,960
It says I have four left but I can't tell if it's equipped or not.

1639
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:27,860
Someone said it's not.

1640
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,220
In the menu.

1641
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:38,840
I can't tell.

1642
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:50,510
So stupid.

1643
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:54,590
Wow that looks like a real hornet's nest.

1644
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:56,550
Thank you guys for all the gifted memberships.

1645
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:57,730
Thank you so so so so much.

1646
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,870
I really appreciate it.

1647
02:03:59,210 --> 02:03:59,830
Thank you!

1648
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:06,850
One odd.

1649
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:08,390
Wait, you can toggle...

1650
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:10,950
Wait, I can't.

1651
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:11,310
Oh.

1652
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:13,930
I do have the crocodile cap.

1653
02:04:14,110 --> 02:04:15,550
I guess it came...

1654
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:16,830
But it's one odd.

1655
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:18,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1656
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:22,990
You can toggle the display of this item during cutscenes on and off from...

1657
02:04:22,990 --> 02:04:24,450
That's nice.

1658
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:28,950
Wait, hold on.

1659
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,120
What was I doing?

1660
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:34,680

1663
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:19,610
I also saw that if you're wearing the full thing and you go up to guards, they run away.

1664
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:20,730
They're scared of you.

1665
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:26,210
It's Flat Fuck Friday.

1666
02:05:28,130 --> 02:05:29,990

Yes.

1675
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:53,890
The best crew has to offer.

1676
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:55,630
They said in options, right?

1677
02:06:57,070 --> 02:06:57,870

1678
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:02,750
Camera shake?

1679
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:03,290
Okay, wait.

1680
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:03,930
I just realized.

1681
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:05,070
Let's do weak for that.

1682
02:07:05,190 --> 02:07:06,250
I don't like that kind of stuff.

1683
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:08,130
Show bleeding effects on.

1684
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:09,290
There we go.

1685
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:09,630
There we go.

1686
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:10,070
There we go.

1687
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:18,160
I finished.

1688
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:19,560
Calm down.

1689
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,180
I'll get you out of here, I promise.

1690
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:58,500
And we've got some of the best back up we could ask look oh wait what is this that's what they were making you build yes the shagohod the treading behemoth a tank capable of launching nuclear IRBM it's too good from that kind of terrain oh yes without support from friendly units a nuclear equipped tank capable of operating solo wow

1691
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:23,460
is that thing finished no this is only the end of phase one it won't be truly finished until we complete phase two phase two the weapon's true form it's so funny if it is completed and the Cold War.

1692
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:24,920
The end of the Cold War.

1693
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,760
And then the age of fear will truly begin.

1694
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:31,320
Uh-oh.

1695
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,220
The World War.

1696
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:35,360
I had no choice but to cooperate.

1697
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:38,980
I didn't want to die.

1698
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,860
I don't want to see Ken or Ty talking about World Wars.

1699
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,600
Please, take me to America.

1700
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:47,240
Quickly.

1701
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:49,060
I don't want to see that.

1702
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:52,500
They cannot complete it without my help.

1703
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:56,980
It even looks so good though.

1704
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:01,020
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

1705
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:05,310
Okay.

1706
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:08,230
I'm going to turn it off for this though.

1707
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:11,710
So we can see his expressions and stuff.

1708
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:13,990
I won't do this all the time.

1709
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:17,230
Off.

1710
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:18,930
Okay.

1711
02:09:19,490 --> 02:09:24,450
If you enable this setting, please note that displaying such items may interfere with the immersive experience.

1712
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,990
experience.

1713
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:26,750
Okay.

1714
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:44,110
I've only fell all in, like, a couple times on this bridge.

1715
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:56,800
After this cutscene is everything that I've played up to, by the way.

1716
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:11,100
I thought you were in the Arctic Sea.

1717
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:19,330
Boss?

1718
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:21,390
Whoa!

1719
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:22,990
Whoa!

1720
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,680
Good work, Jack.

1721
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:35,860
What are you doing here?

1722
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:38,120
Sokolov comes with me.

1723
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,960
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see everybody.

1724
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:55,410
Oh, I got the bees!

1725
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:57,790
Is this killing the frame rate?

1726
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:02,410
Yeah!

1727
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:12,430
Lobbies!

1728
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:13,330
Lobbies!

1729
02:11:19,230 --> 02:11:23,310
my bit rate they

1730
02:11:36,770 --> 02:12:06,870

1732
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:38,670
spooky oh

1733
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:02,010
Oh, what a joyful scene.

1734
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:03,610
Oh, don't say that.

1735
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:04,330
Colonel Vogan.

1736
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:06,430
Welcome to my country.

1737
02:13:07,890 --> 02:13:09,030
And to my unit.

1738
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:15,990
Boss, what is this?

1739
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:17,670
He poses and she does not care.

1740
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:18,910
I'm defecting to the Soviet Union.

1741
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:21,790
Sokolov is a little gift from my new hosts.

1742
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:25,310
Recoilless nuclear warheads.

1743
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:31,250
Recoilless nuclear warheads is actually insane.

1744
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:32,390
These will make a fire.

1745
02:13:32,410 --> 02:14:04,750
gift for me this can't be happening who is he another one of your disciples how many disciples do you have huh wasn't I special taking him with us no this one is still just a child too pure for us Cobras baby cracker he has not yet found an emotion to carry into battle what are you talking about think you can pull the trigger oh and

1746
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:19,960
one smooth swoop you're still just a baby

1747
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:31,200
see my face

1748
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:43,200
vulgan's hair looks so strange like i don't think i i guess because of the textures in the original game, I don't imagine him with hair.

1749
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:45,420
So seeing him with hair is so bizarre.

1750
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:49,180
You saved Kero-Tan from that fate.

1751
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:57,600
He must die.

1752
02:14:59,560 --> 02:14:59,920
Wait.

1753
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:01,940
He's my apprentice.

1754
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:03,600
I'll take care of him.

1755
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:05,360
Oh, this looks so good.

1756
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:07,200
My goodness, she's so pretty.

1757
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:11,380
It's like he's has hair that babies have.

1758
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:12,860
You can't come with us.

1759
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:14,620
You can't sit with us.

1760
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:23,130
This... Boss... Boss, I changed my mind!

1761
02:15:23,470 --> 02:15:24,670
Boss, I changed my mind!

1762
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:27,590
Aww, they have the same gloves on.

1763
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:41,310
The new blood has been...

1764
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,700
And took her bandana.

1765
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:16,690
Are we done here?

1766
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:21,350
Now onto Sokolov's research facility.

1767
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:25,910
Baby hair.

1768
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:30,370
Baby hair, baby hair Vulcan.

1769
02:16:31,470 --> 02:16:33,110
Vulcan with his baby hair.

1770
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:36,510
Vulcan grew two new strands today.

1771
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:48,150
Yeah, Vulcan's face looks incredible.

1772
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:53,330
I think the only one I'm a little lukewarm on is the pain.

1773
02:16:54,030 --> 02:16:59,830
Because I feel like his face underneath looks less of like a face and more of like a...

1774
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:03,750
It looks kind of almost like PNG-ish.

1775
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:07,010
But...

1776
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:10,830
But everyone else looks really, really good.

1777
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,490
Guess we'll see later.

1778
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:25,270
Yeah, he's our first guy, so let's check him out later.

1779
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:28,150
Oh, Snake.

1780
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:32,450
Snake, can you hear me?

1781
02:17:33,890 --> 02:17:34,310
Yeah.

1782
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:36,070
Just barely.

1783
02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:40,310
Emergency medical treatment.

1784
02:17:40,550 --> 02:17:41,070
Can you move?

1785
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:45,110
Oh, wow.

1786
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:46,630
You've got to get those rooms treated.

1787
02:17:46,770 --> 02:17:47,270
Hang in there.

1788
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:48,630
He's fine now.

1789
02:17:49,490 --> 02:17:50,730
He's like, ow, ow.

1790
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,530
Okay, back to position.

1791
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:55,110
Just relax and it'll all be over.

1792
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:56,870
Care menu time!

1793
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:01,210
Stay with me.

1794
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:03,310
I've seen people in worse shape before.

1795
02:18:03,430 --> 02:18:04,070
Just a headache.

1796
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,210
Think you can handle it?

1797
02:18:06,770 --> 02:18:07,210
Major.

1798
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:09,230
The boss.

1799
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:41,330
affected we'll talk about that later first we've got to get you patched up okay here we go first open the survival viewer with the survival viewer button if you select cure you can start the treatment look at this feeling is divided into two types of treatment it's so hard medicine and surgical procedures your injuries include a fractured left elbow and rib bone and lacerations on your upper arms right elbow and abdomen they need to be fixed using surgical treatment treatment.

1800
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:46,930
Move the healing cursor with a movement stick to the affected part of your body and press the inner button.

1801
02:18:47,610 --> 02:18:53,530
Once you've selected the affected area, use the movement stick to select the medical item and then press the inner button.

1802
02:18:53,930 --> 02:18:54,710
Then press the inner button.

1803
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:57,430
With this method, you can use items to help your recovery process.

1804
02:18:58,690 --> 02:19:03,450
To treat a bone fracture, first secure the affected area with a fastener and then wrap it in bandages.

1805
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:04,650
That should do it.

1806
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:05,110
Okay.

1807
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:12,710
For lacerations, you'll need disinfectant to clean the wound, sutures to stitch it up, Sinking voice by Kermit.

1808
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:14,290
Because he is with the back.

1809
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:17,210
If you do everything I mentioned, the wound should heal completely.

1810
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:18,190
Understood?

1811
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:19,670
Yeah.

1812
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:20,150
Yeah.

1813
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:21,090
Stay with me.

1814
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:24,050
Go into the survival viewer and treat those wounds.

1815
02:19:24,510 --> 02:19:24,730
Okay!

1816
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,550
Cure.

1817
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:28,650
Oh, look.

1818
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:31,370
Is freaking dead.

1819
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:33,090
Snake!

1820
02:19:33,730 --> 02:19:34,070
Wow.

1821
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:35,490
Oh my gosh, hold on.

1822
02:19:35,890 --> 02:19:38,170
Let me just appreciate the beauty.

1823
02:19:38,330 --> 02:19:39,110
Wait, can we see?

1824
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:44,870
You can see him right there!

1825
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:46,850
Oh my god!

1826
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:51,290
You can see a skeleton right there!

1827
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:53,850
That's crazy!

1828
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:57,910
That's crazy!

1829
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:00,550
Yeah, take a picture.

1830
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:11,390
Oh my gosh.

1831
02:20:13,210 --> 02:20:14,150
That's him!

1832
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,830
Check his pulse.

1833
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,970
Look, he's throwing paper.

1834
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:26,080
Uh, wait.

1835
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:27,420
Uh, hide.

1836
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:29,400
Cool.

1837
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:34,720
Okay.

1838
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:35,820
Sorry, Snake.

1839
02:20:35,980 --> 02:20:36,680
I'll get you cured up.

1840
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:37,880
Wait.

1841
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:39,940
Oh, okay.

1842
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:40,760
I just press up.

1843
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:41,500
That's kind of nice.

1844
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,340
Instead of holding it, like, for the camouflage.

1845
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:45,920
Select cure.

1846
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,540
Okay, we know this.

1847
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:48,080
We know this.

1848
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:50,400
Oh, he's not looking so high.

1849
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:52,840
All right.

1850
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:54,660
Suffering from a deep cut.

1851
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:56,960
We need...

1852
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,640
We need to...

1853
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:59,240
Wait.

1854
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:00,580
We need to disinfect it.

1855
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:03,900
We need to stop bleeding.

1856
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,200
We need to bandage it.

1857
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:09,600
I'm going way out of order.

1858
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,220
Is that the floating spooky glasses guy?

1859
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:19,320
Stabilized!

1860
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:21,080
Bandage.

1861
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:23,080
Okay, we got a cut.

1862
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:25,040
We got a bandage.

1863
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:25,920
Oh, whoops.

1864
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:27,060
I forgot to stop the bleeding.

1865
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:29,840
And disinfect it.

1866
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,220
Uh, uh, uh, disinfect it.

1867
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:36,940
Stop bleeding.

1868
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:39,780
A bandage.

1869
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:42,540
So, we're way out of order.

1870
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:45,520
It's so out of order!

1871
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:48,080
Um...

1872
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:49,340
There we go.

1873
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:51,040
Oh, more bone fracture.

1874
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,380
Bandage.

1875
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:53,820
Okay, we're fine.

1876
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:56,740
It doesn't matter.

1877
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:03,560
Yeah, you chew on that.

1878
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:09,240
Someday you chew on a tree bark.

1879
02:22:35,430 --> 02:22:36,670
He's so handsome.

1880
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:37,590
I know, right?

1881
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:53,430
Yeah, I use that.

1882
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:54,790
Good idea.

1883
02:22:57,790 --> 02:22:59,130
Good job, Snake.

1884
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:01,470
We're coming to get you now.

1885
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:02,430
Just stay where you are.

1886
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:03,970
We'll drop a recovery balloon.

1887
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:05,170
Can you set it up?

1888
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:05,750
Fulton me.

1889
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:17,180
Oh.

1890
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,760
And I...

1891
02:23:29,900 --> 02:23:31,440
Uh-oh.

1892
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:36,620
Whoa, that's a great shot.

1893
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:39,000
Shagohod.

1894
02:23:50,450 --> 02:23:51,890
He's so limp.

1895
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,460
Papers!

1896
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,080
Scissors!

1897
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:03,940
Always go with rock.

1898
02:24:18,370 --> 02:24:20,010
Good old rock.

1899
02:24:20,990 --> 02:24:22,070
I can't beat that.

1900
02:24:24,770 --> 02:24:26,830
Can't beat Rob, doesn't beat it.

1901
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:32,330
I wonder what this game is like in Ultra.

1902
02:24:34,930 --> 02:24:35,730
Oh no.

1903
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:37,690
Oh no.

1904
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:38,830
Oh no.

1905
02:24:39,090 --> 02:24:40,770
There he is, my boy.

1906
02:24:41,330 --> 02:24:43,830
He's not a freak considering his entire life.

1907
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:50,130
Thank you so much for the gifted pod, thank you.

1908
02:24:50,890 --> 02:24:51,090
Oh.

1909
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,560
What a freak.

1910
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:57,780
This guy's the freaks of all, the freak of all freaks.

1911
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:02,700
Excellent.

1912
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,840
A great success.

1913
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:13,620
Thanks to the boss and her cobras, I have both Sokolov and the Shagohad.

1914
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,180
There's a smelly woman behind you.

1915
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:19,220
I love that picture of it.

1916
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,620
What are we going to do with the girl?

1917
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:28,480
Who is she?

1918
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:42,900
Apparently she's Sokolov's woman Ooh la la Sokolov must have the The charm of A Greek god

1919
02:25:46,100 --> 02:26:00,660
She's a nice catch Yeah she is I'll take her I'll take her Not so fast my dear Is this a lipstick Oh A

1920
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:10,100
kiss of death.

1921
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:11,500
You KGB.

1922
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,440
We may be able to use her.

1923
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:17,080
Their outfits match.

1924
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:20,200
She has Spunk.

1925
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:22,200
She's so pretty.

1926
02:26:22,980 --> 02:26:24,420
Good lord, she's so pretty.

1927
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,760
Oh, no, everybody's so attractive.

1928
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:28,520
It's unfair.

1929
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,540
Shall we take her back to the base?

1930
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:32,900
Perhaps we should.

1931
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:36,620
We have no further use the Silkolovs research facility.

1932
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:39,900
I think it's time I gave this girl some toy.

1933
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:40,620
They're winning!

1934
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,780
Let them twin!

1935
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:44,720
Oh, oh no.

1936
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:47,800
Even if they are our enemies, they're still our countrymen.

1937
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,700
But it won't be me that pulled the trigger.

1938
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:54,560
It'll be our friend, the American defector.

1939
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:56,740
You're going to nuke your fellow Russians?

1940
02:26:58,460 --> 02:26:59,940
Remember the Alamo.

1941
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:01,400
Colonel.

1942
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,380
Remember the Alamo.

1943
02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:26,030
Little baby.

1944
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:32,470
Beam

1945
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:37,630
of the guy getting flashbanged.

1946
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:45,560
Oh, no.

1947
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:46,280
He didn't.

1948
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:47,620
Oh, yes, he did.

1949
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:53,480
Yeah, the final bit is human.

1950
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,420
Minor spelling mistake.

1951
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:04,070
Virtuous mission.

1952
02:28:09,930 --> 02:28:37,730
completed all right we're out of we're out of the tutorial so this is the new opening this is not the original one if we played on legacy style we would have the original one but this is the new one which I think is also the new yeah it's the new what's it called with darkness the re-recording as well but it's still Still Cynthia.

1953
02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:46,350
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

1954
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:50,750
What a fear in my heart.

1955
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:53,170
I don't see anything I can control.

1956
02:28:54,130 --> 02:28:55,390
Oh there's some guys!

1957
02:28:57,530 --> 02:29:05,670
I give my life not for honor but for you.

1958
02:29:06,990 --> 02:29:08,910
In Korean!

1959
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:18,910
In my time, there'll be no one else.

1960
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:28,030
Crime, it's the way I fly to you.

1961
02:29:30,570 --> 02:29:34,390
I'm still in a dream.

1962
02:29:34,490 --> 02:29:35,470
They have the peace.

1963
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,970
There it is.

1964
02:29:36,990 --> 02:29:40,230
I'm literally needing a snake.

1965
02:29:41,710 --> 02:30:21,100
Someday you go through the rain And someday you'll feed on a tree frog This ordeal, the trial to survive For the day we feed alive I give life I love, I love, I love, I love In my time There'll be no one

1966
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:41,740
Crime It's the way I fly To you I'm still in a dream Snail

1967
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:53,670
Wait, I forgot to press

1968
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:02,970
No sneeter button

1969
02:31:07,030 --> 02:32:11,290
That's kind of sad Maybe in the original there is Like if you do the legacy Cynthia still got it Her voice is still so beautiful After all these years Oh my god ocean altitude 30,000 feet you guys shut the fuck up please i don't care about your opinion go to twitter or reddit drone oil pressure and voltage are nominal payload oxygen supply is nominal power supply to payload any free system shows no problems no gusts all systems go for drone detachment snake we can't risk a halo jump this time around airspace security has gotten tighter since we were last here we can't get as close to the ground as we did during the virtuous mission so instead we'll be using one of our newest weapons snake you're being given an honor on par with alan shepherd this is our last chance show your patriotism if you fail you'll be back in a hospital bed again waiting for the firing squad

1970
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:23,230
sorry i wasn't pressing r2 i was bad so how does it feel to be a patient in one of the most advanced Sorry, I forgot to press R2.

1971
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:24,410
I forgot to press R2.

1972
02:32:24,730 --> 02:32:27,390
I'll never get better with them assaulting me day and night.

1973
02:32:27,390 --> 02:32:28,650
I always say R2, I don't know why.

1974
02:32:29,650 --> 02:32:31,970
Must be part of the top brass's inquiry.

1975
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:33,590
More like an interrogation.

1976
02:32:34,130 --> 02:32:37,350
According to them, I'm a traitor and an accomplice to the boss's defection.

1977
02:32:38,870 --> 02:32:40,350
They're just looking for a scapegoat.

1978
02:32:41,050 --> 02:32:42,870
Does that mean they're after you too?

1979
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:44,550
It's okay, we'll see the other posters.

1980
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:47,090
Neither one of us is going to be made a national hero out of this.

1981
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:49,810
Does this mean Fox is going to die?

1982
02:32:51,070 --> 02:32:53,410
This fox is still one step ahead of the house.

1983
02:32:53,990 --> 02:32:58,810
The reason I came to see you today Jack It's time for Fox to clear its name.

1984
02:32:58,810 --> 02:32:59,970
What are you talking about?

1985
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:01,810
The situation has changed.

1986
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:03,890
We've still got a chance to come out of this one alive.

1987
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:05,210
Yeah, what kind of chance?

1988
02:33:05,530 --> 02:33:08,810
Don't get too excited Fox died.

1989
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:09,470
Here, have a cigar.

1990
02:33:10,470 --> 02:33:10,910
It's Cuba.

1991
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:12,150
Where'd he go?

1992
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,830
Where'd he go?

1993
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:16,970
He's a ghost.

1994
02:33:18,170 --> 02:33:19,990
This morning I had a meeting with the CIA.

1995
02:33:20,690 --> 02:33:22,930
They decided when they're going to execute us.

1996
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:26,710
Something even bigger.

1997
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:29,150
What's that?

1998
02:33:29,150 --> 02:33:32,230
Yesterday, the White House received an unexpected call.

1999
02:33:32,630 --> 02:33:32,670
Okay.

2000
02:33:34,290 --> 02:33:35,330
President Johnson?

2001
02:33:37,490 --> 02:33:39,130
Yes, I hear you, Mr. Chairman.

2002
02:33:41,390 --> 02:33:44,590
It was a hotline call from Khrushchev to President Johnson.

2003
02:33:44,690 --> 02:33:45,030
They're so bad.

2004
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:46,410
From the head of the Soviet Union?

2005
02:33:46,810 --> 02:33:47,290
That's right.

2006
02:33:48,290 --> 02:33:57,910
A few days ago, one of our countries main design bureaus, OKB 754, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion.

2007
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:07,570
At about the same time, our anti-aircraft radar picked up a signature that appeared to come from one of your military aircraft.

2008
02:34:08,510 --> 02:34:11,190
Does any of this sound familiar to you?

2009
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:18,110
In retaliation, I have placed our armed forces on secondary alert.

2010
02:34:19,090 --> 02:34:23,590
Depending on your response, The president's voice acting always gets me in the scene.

2011
02:34:24,350 --> 02:34:25,190
Both are so funny.

2012
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:27,010
And unleash Armageddon.

2013
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:28,810
Doesn't sound Russian.

2014
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:35,110
With the help of your predecessor, I was able to survive a Cuban incident.

2015
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:40,270
But my power is not as great as it once was.

2016
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:47,710
If I am to survive this crisis, I must have your full cooperation.

2017
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:51,870
I contacted you myself.

2018
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:57,170
Did you know that one of our soldiers defected to your country a week ago?

2019
02:34:58,050 --> 02:34:58,590
I'm American.

2020
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:01,610
So you haven't heard that.

2021
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:08,190
The man who arranged the defection was a group colonel by the name of Yevgeny Borosovich Volgin.

2022
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:09,810
Yevgeny.

2023
02:35:10,710 --> 02:35:12,650
Of the Brezhne faction.

2024
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:15,010
Go on.

2025
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:16,110
I love this scene.

2026
02:35:16,130 --> 02:35:16,890
Who is the soldier?

2027
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:19,450
Her name is the boss.

2028
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:20,230
The boss.

2029
02:35:20,650 --> 02:36:21,290
a living legend during World War two she was the one who led us to victory in that war in Russia you know hers boy a voter boy a voter the boss the mother of your special forces yes that's the one she took two miniature nuclear shells along with her the boss took two miniature nuclear shells I'm afraid so I believe they were a gift for her new hosts the Davy Crockett atomic battle group delivery system was completed two years ago like freaks out over it serious problems were found with the launchers range and precision although they were mass-produced they've never been deployed in battle but Sokolos research facility was completely wiped out the whole area is polluted I can only offer you my deepest condolences over this terrible tragedy So,

2030
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:31,430
the boss, with Colonel Vulcan's help, stole two experimental nuclear shells and took them with her as a gift when she defected.

2031
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:40,170
Then, shortly thereafter, Sokolos Design Lab, a top-secret military research facility, was destroyed by one of these weapons.

2032
02:36:40,670 --> 02:36:42,830
Am I right so far?

2033
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:44,730
Yes, that's correct.

2034
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:49,710
He, like, crosses so close to, like, a Hispanic accent so much.

2035
02:36:50,650 --> 02:36:51,890
right as well.

2036
02:36:52,710 --> 02:36:53,150
That's correct.

2037
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:55,450
We were not involved in any way.

2038
02:36:56,090 --> 02:36:59,570
Then what was a US military aircraft doing on our radar screen?

2039
02:37:00,370 --> 02:37:06,870
It was clearly in a violation of our airspace and yet you say it was not acting under your orders.

2040
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:08,590
That's correct.

2041
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:10,870
It's historically accurate.

2042
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:13,630
You expect me to believe that this was all the work of a single soldier.

2043
02:37:13,650 --> 02:37:14,630
I believe that's right.

2044
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:16,850
I don't know what else to tell you.

2045
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:17,590
I don't know.

2046
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:23,950
The army insists that this is all a ploy on your I've said it once and I'll say it again.

2047
02:37:24,130 --> 02:37:26,330
Our government had nothing to do with it.

2048
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:29,570
I'll tell you what our government had nothing to do with it.

2049
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:34,690
However, I'm afraid my power over the military has weakened since the Cuban incident.

2050
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:39,550
I will need some kind of proof that this was not the action of the American government.

2051
02:37:43,310 --> 02:37:44,810
You have one week.

2052
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:49,410
You must catch the boss yourselves and recover the remaining nuclear device.

2053
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:54,290
find some way to prove your innocence.

2054
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:54,750
Blitzar, welcome.

2055
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:55,330
Thank you.

2056
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:56,310
I also love that.

2057
02:37:56,350 --> 02:37:56,670
Prove our innocence.

2058
02:37:58,350 --> 02:38:01,570
Yes, preferably something painful.

2059
02:38:02,730 --> 02:38:05,770
Prove to me that this is not merely another one of your tricks.

2060
02:38:05,890 --> 02:38:08,590
President Johnson sells propane and propane accessories.

2061
02:38:08,690 --> 02:38:09,890
The boss should be close to Colonel Volgan.

2062
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:12,390
How about a little co-action?

2063
02:38:12,970 --> 02:38:15,530
I would not expect too much if I were you.

2064
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:17,730
The political situation here is unstable.

2065
02:38:18,790 --> 02:38:54,870
And Colonel Volgan is a member of of faction which seeks to topple my government one week you have only one week and if it is not too much to ask do something about Vulcan as well what is that supposed to mean nothing means nothing call it a modest gentleman's agreement to ensure our continued relationship what if we can't prove our innocence then I will be unable to I will be ousted and they will seek their revenge.

2066
02:38:56,470 --> 02:38:58,810
A nuclear attack on the United States.

2067
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:05,810
Leave the disposal of this situation entirely to your discretion, Mr. President.

2068
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:07,010
Mr. President.

2069
02:39:08,170 --> 02:39:13,130
If you fail, it will mean the beginning of a new world war.

2070
02:39:13,210 --> 02:39:15,410
We just got out of a world war.

2071
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:22,430
Put it simply, in order to avoid a full-scale nuclear conflict, That proved that America was not involved in that explosion.

2072
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:22,790
Guys are so annoying.

2073
02:39:23,530 --> 02:39:26,830
And eliminating the boss ourselves will prove America's innocence.

2074
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:33,490
The higher-ups have decided that you're the only one capable of pulling this off.

2075
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:36,170
You were her last apprentice.

2076
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:38,910
Screw this one up and we'll both be six feet under.

2077
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:40,050
There's no choice.

2078
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:41,410
God damn it, another one.

2079
02:39:43,730 --> 02:39:46,290
Like chill for two seconds.

2080
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:49,870
Are the Russians going to be helping us?

2081
02:39:50,390 --> 02:39:51,070
Oh, wait!

2082
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:52,410
The KGB has promised...

2083
02:39:52,410 --> 02:39:53,350
There you guys go!

2084
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:55,490
Oh, Yumi Kikuchi!

2085
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:59,090
That's it.

2086
02:39:59,290 --> 02:39:59,670
You're welcome.

2087
02:40:00,030 --> 02:40:01,710
They've also put us in touch with a couple of insiders.

2088
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:03,030
Insiders?

2089
02:40:04,210 --> 02:40:06,010
There was a defection in September 1960.

2090
02:40:06,030 --> 02:40:07,830
We ended up getting the poster after all!

2091
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:12,930
You mean the two NSA co-workers who went over to the Soviet Union?

2092
02:40:13,630 --> 02:40:14,710
She's so crazy, right?

2093
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:20,370
Since then, they've apparently been training with the KGB for exactly this kind of situation.

2094
02:40:20,390 --> 02:40:22,690
They're codenames for Adam and Eva.

2095
02:40:24,010 --> 02:40:26,410
I've been told that Adam has infiltrated Vulcan's ranks.

2096
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:31,090
We've also arranged for him to provide you with an escape route.

2097
02:40:32,250 --> 02:40:34,490
You'll need to rendezvous with him when you get there.

2098
02:40:41,730 --> 02:40:42,210
Your

2099
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:58,980
English is so good!

2100
02:41:03,610 --> 02:41:05,170
Suddenly, we're playing is combat.

2101
02:41:05,310 --> 02:41:05,710
It's fast.

2102
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:08,130
Estimated airspeed exceeding Mach 3.

2103
02:41:08,770 --> 02:41:09,590
Bearing south.

2104
02:41:10,390 --> 02:41:11,510
I'm about to lose it.

2105
02:41:11,730 --> 02:41:13,190
I'm about to lose it.

2106
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:16,970
I'm about to lose it.

2107
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:32,650
The girly poster is still there?

2108
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:37,270
It's been updated with, like, new pictures of the models from the original.

2109
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:40,970
Some of them even show them with their kids.

2110
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:41,850
It's so sweet.

2111
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:46,310
But if you play Legacy, it's the original pictures.

2112
02:41:53,420 --> 02:41:54,160
It's so sweet.

2113
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:55,140
You're right!

2114
02:42:04,060 --> 02:42:06,560
Stick with trigger and you'll make it.

2115
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:21,400
I need the little brackets in your for your super chat around your message Oh gosh Seeing it with the bandana now.

2116
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:22,160
Oh my god.

2117
02:42:22,460 --> 02:42:27,100
It's so good So good

2118
02:42:32,570 --> 02:42:33,790
This is snake.

2119
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:34,770
Do you read man?

2120
02:42:34,790 --> 02:43:05,050
loud and clear I have to keep adjusting the volume sorry guys I got blown pretty far off target snake let's go over your mission objectives one more time rescue Sokolov find out what's happened to the Shagahod then destroy it and finally eliminate the very photogenic picture of the Shagahod this mission will be codenamed Operation Snake Eater because I'll be taking on the boss in our Cobra unit right don't forget about Colonel Vulcan I'm not a hired killer her.

2121
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:07,750
I know, but that was the Kremlin's demand.

2122
02:43:08,470 --> 02:43:08,570
Demand?

2123
02:43:09,290 --> 02:43:10,870
You mean it wasn't just a request.

2124
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:15,150
What's it to us if the Khrushchev regime is threatened by the Colonel and his faction?

2125
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:16,710
I don't want to go into the operation.

2126
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:19,350
I don't want to do it.

2127
02:43:19,710 --> 02:43:20,590
I'm too sad.

2128
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:23,130
And what are the CIA's demands?

2129
02:43:23,870 --> 02:43:27,310
Our priorities are the rescue of Sokolov and the destruction of the Shagahod.

2130
02:43:28,050 --> 02:43:29,310
Roger that, Major Tom.

2131
02:43:29,650 --> 02:43:30,250
Hold on, Snake.

2132
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:31,270
What now?

2133
02:43:31,650 --> 02:43:32,990
I'm changing my code name.

2134
02:43:33,570 --> 02:44:31,270
It turns out Tom the most auspicious choice what do you want to see a change well the truth is when i chose my code name i picked the wrong one the wrong one did you ever see the movie the great escape came out last year you're so silly missed that one anyway it's based on a true story about prisoners who escaped from a pow camp in nazi germany the prisoners dig three tunnels as part of their plan but the nazis find two of the tunnels before they're finished the prisoners succeed in escaping by using the last remaining tunnel the names of those three tunnels were dick harry and tom i get it you use the name of the tunnel they escaped in as your code name because you thought it would bring you good luck yes that's exactly right at least we got the wrong one but i got the name wrong the one they escaped him was harry major harry doesn't roll off the tongue well though discovered by the nazis before it was finished i watched the movie again just to make sure when did you have i was dying

2135
02:44:31,270 --> 02:45:38,330
in the hospital and you're watching movies name to use so what should i call you do you have any urgency major let's just use zero like we've been doing all along all right like my goodness zero it is updated we'll start over from square one from square zero my frequency is one four zero point eight five oh important research true medic is with us again on this mission is this her last chance too if we fail she'll have her it's more or less the same you know what that might be for the better her frequency is the same as during the virtuous mission one four five profile pick looks so good oh my god you slaying mission data as well just like the last time that frequency is also the same one four zero point nine six and there's one more person on your support team his name is mr sigint yeah he's an expert on the latest in weapons and equipment technology you'll be going up against Some of the world's most advanced weaponry when you infiltrate the research facility.

2136
02:45:39,190 --> 02:45:40,890
If you have any questions, just ask him.

2137
02:45:41,430 --> 02:45:42,030
His frequency.

2138
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:43,550
His special talent at parties?

2139
02:45:44,270 --> 02:45:45,890
Counting the number of hairs on his head.

2140
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:47,990
Mr. Siggant, got it.

2141
02:45:48,970 --> 02:45:53,090
Adam, your KGB contact, is waiting for you at the abandoned factory up ahead.

2142
02:45:53,190 --> 02:45:53,430
Okay.

2143
02:45:53,630 --> 02:45:56,370
The same factory Sokolov was being held in last week.

2144
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:58,410
Yes, meet up with Adam first.

2145
02:45:58,530 --> 02:46:00,470
He's cleared the way for you to rescue Sokolov.

2146
02:46:01,090 --> 02:46:03,410
How will I know this Adam guy when I see him?

2147
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:09,130
The whole area has been polluted by the fallout from that nuclear blast.

2148
02:46:09,970 --> 02:46:11,410
No one else would dare come close.

2149
02:46:12,110 --> 02:46:14,630
The password is, Who are the Patriots?

2150
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:16,510
And Lali Lululelo.

2151
02:46:16,930 --> 02:46:18,850
Lali Lululelo.

2152
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:19,290
Gotcha.

2153
02:46:19,830 --> 02:46:22,550
You've been equipped with a 45 for this mission.

2154
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:23,470
Be careful.

2155
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:24,250
It's noisy.

2156
02:46:24,850 --> 02:46:28,650
I thought standard Fox procedure was procure-on-site weapons acquisition.

2157
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:30,850
The circumstances are different this time.

2158
02:46:31,410 --> 02:46:34,310
You're now on an official mission for the United States government.

2159
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:40,910
It would be necessary to make your presence known to a certain extent to the Khrushchev regime at the very least.

2160
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:41,510
The Patriots.

2161
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:44,130
But remember, this is still a sneaking mission.

2162
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:48,390
Snake, if you fail this mission, it will mean an all-out nuclear war.

2163
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:51,630
Keep that in mind and proceed with extreme caution.

2164
02:46:53,270 --> 02:46:54,970
Commencing Operation Snake Eater.

2165
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,260
Wow.

2166
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:08,140
And this is where I started playing in New York, and then they kicked me out.

2167
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:16,620
Like, um, you're only allowed to play up to, um, you're only allowed to play to the end of Virtuous Mission.

2168
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:21,540
Because I kept skipping all the cutscenes.

2169
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:26,460
I was like, wait, but I have still 10 minutes.

2170
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:29,520
They were like, well, it's only 10 minutes.

2171
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:33,560
I said, okay.

2172
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:35,980
And I left.

2173
02:47:43,190 --> 02:47:47,690
Let's see what other animals we got in here.

2174
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:54,170
Whoa, it's so dark.

2175
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:56,050
I did turn up the brightness a little bit.

2176
02:47:56,230 --> 02:47:57,370
Oh, I'm on a snake.

2177
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:01,750
Whoa!

2178
02:48:04,230 --> 02:48:05,790
Sensitive little guy.

2179
02:48:08,110 --> 02:48:08,570
Holy.

2180
02:48:12,530 --> 02:48:14,170
I see you.

2181
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:18,310
Wait, I don't have a suppressor anymore?

2182
02:48:18,890 --> 02:48:19,730
That kind of sucks.

2183
02:48:29,230 --> 02:48:31,130
Is that the Boko Boko?

2184
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,630
All our fruit.

2185
02:48:36,910 --> 02:48:37,370
Wait, hold on.

2186
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:40,730
Paramedic, tell me what this is.

2187
02:48:40,990 --> 02:48:41,290
Now!

2188
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:44,970
Paramedic.

2189
02:48:45,390 --> 02:48:47,750
Snake, it's so good to hear from you again.

2190
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:48,810
I'm hungry.

2191
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:50,790
It's been a week, hasn't it?

2192
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:52,170
Four days, actually.

2193
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:52,470
Me?

2194
02:48:52,990 --> 02:48:55,030
I visited you in the hospital.

2195
02:48:55,410 --> 02:48:56,530
You were still unconscious, though.

2196
02:48:57,430 --> 02:48:59,530
Then you must have seen me naked.

2197
02:49:00,390 --> 02:49:04,690
Yeah, but you were all wrapped up in bandages and tubes, so I couldn't do anything, but look.

2198
02:49:05,370 --> 02:49:06,570
Better luck next time.

2199
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:08,650
Let's hope so.

2200
02:49:09,290 --> 02:49:13,090
But seriously, don't forget that you were like that until just yesterday.

2201
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:15,750
In fact, you really shouldn't even be on this mission.

2202
02:49:16,690 --> 02:49:18,270
Keep an eye on your stamina gauge.

2203
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:21,190
If you start to run low, don't push yourself.

2204
02:49:22,190 --> 02:49:53,190
replenish your stamina and try not to get yourself hurt if you're wounded or get bitten by a venomous animal go into the survival viewer immediately and treat yourself using cure yeah yeah I can see you still know how to nag you're welcome and I can you still don't know when to get your mouth shut snake by the way I heard you're going to lose your medical license if this mission fails yes there was talk of that but the mission won't fail will it Of course not.

2205
02:49:53,210 --> 02:49:53,850
Yeah, well fair.

2206
02:49:54,530 --> 02:49:55,370
I believe in you.

2207
02:49:56,210 --> 02:49:56,810
But you know what?

2208
02:49:57,350 --> 02:49:59,250
I really don't care about my medical license.

2209
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:02,650
Didn't they use that to force you to participate in this operation?

2210
02:50:03,410 --> 02:50:04,490
No, I volunteered.

2211
02:50:05,210 --> 02:50:05,590
Why?

2212
02:50:06,050 --> 02:50:08,290
So that I could watch over you.

2213
02:50:08,610 --> 02:50:08,870
Huh.

2214
02:50:09,650 --> 02:50:12,250
Snake, you're the best agent I've ever seen.

2215
02:50:12,810 --> 02:50:14,270
But you push yourself too hard.

2216
02:50:14,530 --> 02:50:15,070
You're reckless.

2217
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:16,410
You're the best agent I've ever seen.

2218
02:50:16,410 --> 02:50:18,150
Someone has to stop you from getting into trouble.

2219
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:21,190
I'm like running around in a frogman.

2220
02:50:22,190 --> 02:51:28,250
mask so that's why i volunteered i mean you couldn't ask for a better guardian angel than me right thanks stop right there you can thank me when you get back all right all right hold on let's call her again snake unlike the virtuous mission this is a night operation you'll be encountering nocturnal animals that you didn't encounter your last and we gotta call sigint too some of them are venomous like the king cobra so be careful okay if you get bitten by a venomous animal the poison will spread through your body and rapidly drain your life gauge if that's the case go into the cure screen and survival viewer immediately we got to get through a couple serum got it a couple codex though to get to our fruit i see you caught yourself a reticulated python the reticulated python is said to be the longest snake in the world the biggest ones can grow up to 10 they're still very dangerous so be careful around them they have a highly ferocious temperament and they can swallow whole even large

2221
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:50,350
animals like deer and pigs their most distinguishing feature is the mesh pattern of their scales this pattern acts as a highly effective natural camouflage if you think there might be a reticulated she said this at the panel too otherwise she was like reticulated python it's a huge snake but you should be able to capture it alive by using the tranquilizer gun.

2222
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:54,470
I'll bet if you capture one and throw it at an enemy, it'll give them a good scare.

2223
02:51:54,550 --> 02:51:54,930
I do.

2224
02:51:55,430 --> 02:51:55,750
Actually!

2225
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:56,930
But how do they taste?

2226
02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:57,730
Huh?

2227
02:51:58,210 --> 02:51:59,130
Did they taste good?

2228
02:51:59,470 --> 02:52:00,810
You're actually going to eat one.

2229
02:52:01,070 --> 02:52:03,790
Wait, we should throw some on the guys that are going to come up.

2230
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:05,270
What was that?

2231
02:52:05,990 --> 02:52:06,430
Nothing.

2232
02:52:06,850 --> 02:52:08,050
Let's see what the guide says.

2233
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,570
Ah, you're in luck.

2234
02:52:09,830 --> 02:52:11,110
It says they taste pretty good.

2235
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:11,590
Cannibal.

2236
02:52:11,730 --> 02:52:12,050
Good.

2237
02:52:12,590 --> 02:52:13,950
I can hardly wait.

2238
02:52:17,590 --> 02:52:18,450
Okay, hold on.

2239
02:52:18,530 --> 02:52:22,650
I see you found some Siberian ink cap mushrooms.

2240
02:52:23,210 --> 02:52:26,510
The Siberian ink cap is a mushroom from the ink cap family.

2241
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:27,070
Ink cap.

2242
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:29,030
Its life cycle is transitory.

2243
02:52:29,190 --> 02:52:29,550
Ink cap.

2244
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:34,970
As soon as the score is mature, the cap starts to turn black, liquefy, and melt away.

2245
02:52:35,390 --> 02:52:36,970
And that's why they call it an ink cap.

2246
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:38,190
That's right.

2247
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:41,410
It doesn't really turn to liquid, but you get the idea.

2248
02:52:41,950 --> 02:52:46,290
In its immature state, before it melts away, it's valued as a source of food.

2249
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:48,510
Just be sure not to eat them while you're doing it.

2250
02:52:48,530 --> 02:52:49,490
drinking alcohol.

2251
02:52:50,110 --> 02:52:50,590
Why's that?

2252
02:52:51,110 --> 02:52:55,510
Ink caps contain coprin, which inhibits the function of aldehyde dehydrogenase.

2253
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:55,990
Ink cap.

2254
02:52:56,170 --> 02:53:01,010
This prevents the body from breaking down alcohol, causing a buildup of a citaldehyde.

2255
02:53:01,690 --> 02:53:02,250
Meaning?

2256
02:53:02,830 --> 02:53:05,430
Meaning it will give you the hangover from hell.

2257
02:53:06,110 --> 02:53:07,670
Oh, wait a minute.

2258
02:53:07,810 --> 02:53:08,310
What?

2259
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:11,130
You think I'd drink alcohol in the middle of a mission?

2260
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:12,170
Wouldn't you?

2261
02:53:12,690 --> 02:53:13,350
Hell no.

2262
02:53:13,590 --> 02:54:15,790
Well, I'm knocking a shot back now what just teasing you she's so flirty where's your sense of humor i need a drink they're so flirty i see you found a yabloko yabloko yabloko what now yabloko maloko it's a russian name that roughly translates as milk apple it's a type of star apple the juice isn't this one milk hence the name doesn't he not like it one and a half lengthwise you'll see a star-shaped ring radiating out from the center mokoko hence the star right the star-shaped part has a gelatinous texture and is said to be especially tasty sounds useful i'm not yabloko maloko i'm mokoko did you say something no uh back to the mission all right second nice to meet you yo you're snake aren't SICK IT!

2263
02:54:16,850 --> 02:54:20,670
I heard that you're an expert on weapons, equipment, and cutting-edge technology.

2264
02:54:20,930 --> 02:54:22,470
This is my first time seeing him.

2265
02:54:23,130 --> 02:54:27,350
I am the expert on weapons, equipment, and cutting-edge technology.

2266
02:54:27,650 --> 02:54:28,010
Hell yeah.

2267
02:54:29,310 --> 02:54:33,410
I'm the guy that designed your trinket gun, active sonar, and motion detector.

2268
02:54:34,190 --> 02:54:39,250
If you want to know anything about weapons or equipment you find in the field, just send me a message and ask.

2269
02:54:39,270 --> 02:54:39,910
He's the expert.

2270
02:54:40,210 --> 02:54:40,230
Later.

2271
02:54:40,710 --> 02:54:41,110
Later.

2272
02:54:41,930 --> 02:54:42,370
Nice.

2273
02:54:43,730 --> 02:54:44,930
Wait, I want to get something.

2274
02:54:44,950 --> 02:55:09,770

2275
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:25,450
you can attach the suppressor from this menu oh Oh, wait, because, yeah, I have nine.

2276
02:55:25,890 --> 02:55:27,230
Oh, I see it.

2277
02:55:27,270 --> 02:55:27,950
Thank you.

2278
02:55:28,490 --> 02:55:30,250
Okay, now we have it attached.

2279
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:31,150
Okay, oh, wait.

2280
02:55:31,250 --> 02:55:32,790
It's the exact same as the original.

2281
02:55:33,970 --> 02:55:35,070
Golly, I'm dumb.

2282
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:40,970
Sorry.

2283
02:55:41,350 --> 02:55:50,770
I'm so not used to using the D-pad over the triggers for everything.

2284
02:55:51,130 --> 02:55:52,090
It's kind of strange.

2285
02:55:52,810 --> 02:55:53,070
Okay.

2286
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:15,160
does the grenade camel work with stuff that's a great question that's a really good quote wait yeah that's a real oh i keep always forgetting let's see

02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:56,640

2289
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:40,830
it's not to eat Where are they?

2290
02:57:41,230 --> 02:57:41,690
Uh-oh.

2291
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:45,010
Maybe I did kill them.

2292
02:57:45,770 --> 02:57:47,950
Was the light too strong?

2293
02:57:51,420 --> 02:57:51,960
Oh,

2294
02:57:55,470 --> 02:57:56,250
under weapon.

2295
02:57:57,450 --> 02:57:58,550
Oh, there, wait.

2296
02:57:59,810 --> 02:58:00,170
Meat.

2297
02:58:00,450 --> 02:58:01,010
Dang it.

2298
02:58:01,130 --> 02:58:03,550
It'll still distract them, but I wanted to throw...

2299
02:58:03,550 --> 02:58:07,370
I wanted to throw the snake at them, you know, to make them all spooked.

2300
02:58:08,410 --> 02:58:10,130
We should be hearing a horse.

2301
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:12,290
There.

2302
02:58:15,370 --> 02:58:17,630
Look at that guy.

2303
02:58:23,850 --> 02:58:25,850
Holy cow, it's so violent.

2304
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:39,770
I see you caught yourself a green tree python.

2305
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:40,210
Yes.

2306
02:58:40,390 --> 02:58:43,130
The green tree python isn't venomous, so no need to worry.

2307
02:58:43,490 --> 02:58:46,470
It's fairly docile too, so I don't think it's likely to attack you.

2308
02:58:48,690 --> 02:58:50,010
Australia and New Zealand.

2309
02:58:50,630 --> 02:58:54,810
It's a really pretty green color and it lives... oh my God.

2310
02:58:55,510 --> 02:58:56,070
What's wrong?

2311
02:58:56,810 --> 02:58:58,750
Snake, what did I just say?

2312
02:58:59,410 --> 02:59:01,670
They come from Australia and New Zealand.

2313
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:03,290
No, after that.

2314
02:59:03,850 --> 02:59:05,710
They're a really pretty green color.

2315
02:59:06,530 --> 02:59:07,750
I thought so.

2316
02:59:08,170 --> 02:59:09,150
What was I thinking?

2317
02:59:09,550 --> 02:59:11,270
Seeing a snake and calling it pretty?

2318
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:12,710
What's wrong with that?

2319
02:59:12,730 --> 02:59:13,570
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

2320
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:14,270
Everything.

2321
02:59:14,690 --> 02:59:18,630
When a normal woman sees a snake she's supposed to scream or get sick or something like that.

2322
02:59:18,650 --> 02:59:41,830
that and you think you're normal what was that nothing oh i think it's all your fault geez i'm sorry am i not normal what do you mean i love lizards and snakes no i i just wanted you to tell me how it tastes how should i know come on woman was awfully pretty though just tell me how it tastes

2323
02:59:48,650 --> 02:59:50,990
I'm gonna get some water after this.

2324
02:59:51,870 --> 02:59:53,570
Just tell me how it tastes, woman.

2325
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:58,430
I've already been playing for three hours, and I'm only starting a snake eater mission now.

2326
03:00:00,710 --> 03:00:01,230
Oopsie!

2327
03:00:04,610 --> 03:00:07,770
I'm having too much fun just being silly.

2328
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:20,920
Horse.

2329
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:22,380
Haunts.

2330
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:26,220
Looks like death wasn't ready for you yet.

2331
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:31,440
Boss!

2332
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:32,680
Boss?

2333
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:34,880
That arm still hurt?

2334
03:00:35,300 --> 03:00:35,920
A little.

2335
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:40,760
What are you doing here?

2336
03:00:51,970 --> 03:00:53,210
Boss, no!

2337
03:00:53,970 --> 03:00:57,450
I love her sneaking, Suto.

2338
03:00:58,750 --> 03:00:59,550
So pretty.

2339
03:00:59,570 --> 03:00:59,970
Go home.

2340
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:10,580
Drew and my sons are waiting up ahead.

2341
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:14,460
You don't have a prayer of finishing your mission.

2342
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:15,720
You're not even armed.

2343
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:16,760
Well, I was.

2344
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:36,280
I'm not your boss anymore.

2345
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,720
There's nothing for you here.

2346
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:43,720
Go home.

2347
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:53,120
back to your boss there's no need to prove that you're a virtuous here the go home hurts so bad this isn't America

2348
03:02:10,430 --> 03:02:18,090
it's personal that should stir things up a bit you'd better hurry

2349
03:02:27,670 --> 03:02:29,230
You're 60 miles south of here.

2350
03:02:29,690 --> 03:02:31,090
You ought to be able to run that far.

2351
03:02:37,910 --> 03:02:38,910
Why'd you defect?

2352
03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:42,010
I didn't.

2353
03:02:43,270 --> 03:02:45,950
I'm loyal to the end, to my purpose.

2354
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:48,070
What about you, Jack?

2355
03:02:50,330 --> 03:02:51,530
What's it going to be?

2356
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:54,390
Loyalty to your country or loyalty to me?

2357
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:56,790
Your country or your old mentor?

2358
03:02:57,210 --> 03:02:58,590
The mission or your beliefs?

2359
03:02:59,430 --> 03:03:02,090
Your duty to your unit or your personal feelings?

2360
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:11,800
You don't know the truth yet.

2361
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,720
But sooner or later, you'll have to choose.

2362
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:20,020
I don't expect you to forgive me.

2363
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:26,640
But you can't defeat me either.

2364
03:03:28,160 --> 03:03:29,300
You know me too well.

2365
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:34,960
I'll sing out.

2366
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:36,260
Just look at that bandana.

2367
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:39,120
If you can't put the past behind you, you won't survive.

2368
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:41,080
I'll happy birthday after the tag team.

2369
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:47,780
Ow, so!

2370
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:49,480
Now,

2371
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:54,840
go home.

2372
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,320
Oh my god!

2373
03:04:00,380 --> 03:04:01,560
Hurts like hell.

2374
03:04:07,570 --> 03:04:09,410
Solidus guy, happy birthday!

2375
03:04:10,250 --> 03:04:11,330
Happy, happy birthday!

2376
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:13,510
I read you, Snake.

2377
03:04:13,970 --> 03:04:15,350
I was ambushed by the boss.

2378
03:04:15,630 --> 03:04:16,190
You were what?

2379
03:04:16,430 --> 03:04:17,730
The drone's been shot to hell.

2380
03:04:18,070 --> 03:04:18,990
It's up in flames.

2381
03:04:19,330 --> 03:04:19,970
That's not good.

2382
03:04:20,170 --> 03:04:21,850
Enemy scouts are going to come looking for you.

2383
03:04:22,090 --> 03:04:22,670
Yeah, I know.

2384
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:25,510
But what was the boss doing here in the first place?

2385
03:04:25,850 --> 03:04:27,130
There's got to be a leak somewhere.

2386
03:04:27,490 --> 03:04:28,290
No, that's impossible.

2387
03:04:28,650 --> 03:04:32,290
The man the boss is working with Volgin isn't exactly on speaking terms with Khrushchev.

2388
03:04:32,630 --> 03:04:33,570
I lost my gun.

2389
03:04:33,990 --> 03:04:35,110
The boss destroyed it.

2390
03:04:35,370 --> 03:04:35,950
My gun.

2391
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:37,030
Snake, I know how you're feeling.

2392
03:04:37,650 --> 03:04:42,230
It's hard for me to believe, too, that a legendary hero like the boss would go over to the Russians.

2393
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:45,050
But she'd double cross us like this.

2394
03:04:45,270 --> 03:04:51,790
But that's how it is and if you don't accept it, you'll never be able to beat her That's not the problem in terms of sheer technique.

2395
03:04:52,070 --> 03:04:53,230
I'll never be able to beat her.

2396
03:04:53,830 --> 03:04:56,650
I know that all too well You've got to do it snake.

2397
03:04:56,830 --> 03:04:58,630
She's your enemy and your objective.

2398
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:03,470
No We were together for ten years and now you tell me she's my enemy.

2399
03:05:03,570 --> 03:05:08,690
Yeah Hurry to the factory where Adam is waiting Scouts have probably already been sent out.

2400
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:10,030
This is so gray fox all at snake.

2401
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:11,590
You've lost your weapon, right?

2402
03:05:13,150 --> 03:05:28,770
solid stink had to go through the same thing whatever you do don't let them see you so sad oh oh oh grass grass grass my camo is not very high

2403
03:05:33,190 --> 03:05:36,530
let's also do sonar

2404
03:05:41,860 --> 03:05:47,600
ah what the hell is this oh my god it's from over there HQ?

2405
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:48,040
HQ.

2406
03:05:48,940 --> 03:05:49,780
This is HQ.

2407
03:05:51,380 --> 03:05:52,260
Control here.

2408
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:56,720
I thought it was going to be from over there!

2409
03:05:57,240 --> 03:05:59,080
I completely lost where I was looking at.

2410
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:02,000
Oh,

2411
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:05,940
it even highlights them.

2412
03:06:06,060 --> 03:06:06,580
That's kind of nice.

2413
03:06:07,780 --> 03:06:08,480
Will this work?

2414
03:06:11,220 --> 03:06:11,660
Uh.

2415
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:15,220
Are they down?

2416
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:16,840
Where am I?

2417
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:20,140
Oh.

2418
03:06:26,550 --> 03:06:27,090
Anyway.

2419
03:06:37,090 --> 03:06:37,490
Oh, shit.

2420
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:55,020
Who saw me?

2421
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:56,560
Nobody saw me.

2422
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:01,340
What the?

2423
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:03,040
Me into my eyes.

2424
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:05,360
Sorry, I can't help it.

2425
03:07:06,420 --> 03:07:07,620

2426
03:07:07,940 --> 03:07:08,980
I have to use them.

2427
03:07:19,820 --> 03:07:21,940
I can't shoot them.

Oops.

2440
03:09:00,350 --> 03:09:01,410
I should have gotten him, though.

2441
03:09:03,250 --> 03:09:03,610
Why?

2442
03:09:05,090 --> 03:09:06,550
Ah, this didn't work this time.

2443
03:09:07,770 --> 03:09:09,730

2444
03:09:11,290 --> 03:09:11,750
Oh shoot!

2445
03:09:12,190 --> 03:09:12,770
What the?

2446
03:09:12,950 --> 03:09:13,150
Ah!

2447
03:09:14,210 --> 03:09:15,550
It didn't work, everybody.

2448
03:09:17,290 --> 03:09:17,870
Uh, oh.

2449
03:09:21,670 --> 03:09:21,870

2450
03:09:22,490 --> 03:09:22,630

2451
03:09:34,870 --> 03:09:34,970
Ow!

2452
03:09:36,610 --> 03:09:38,510
You can't catch me!

2453
03:09:39,650 --> 03:09:41,670
I have unlimited grenades!

2454
03:09:51,610 --> 03:09:53,370
I keep forgetting I don't have a gun.

2455
03:09:58,750 --> 03:10:31,660

2456
03:10:31,980 --> 03:10:32,840
It's kind of fun.

2457
03:10:43,690 --> 03:10:46,470
I can't remember if anybody's here or not.

2458
03:10:51,210 --> 03:10:52,690
Take some bird juice.

2459
03:10:56,590 --> 03:10:57,110
Wait, what?

2460
03:11:02,040 --> 03:11:03,040
What's here?

2461
03:11:07,210 --> 03:11:08,630
Oh, I think it's all underneath.

2462
03:11:10,650 --> 03:11:13,110
Oh, action button.

2463
03:11:19,320 --> 03:11:22,140
I see you, but I can't get you.

2464
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:24,000
Lame.

2465
03:11:26,500 --> 03:11:27,300
Absolutely lame.

2466
03:11:27,620 --> 03:11:28,220
Oh, there they are.

2467
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:29,560
Wait, I see all these guys.

2468
03:11:30,480 --> 03:11:31,480
You see them over there?

2469
03:11:32,840 --> 03:11:33,700
That's so funny.

2470
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:36,220
Can I throw something at them?

2471
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:42,070
Hmm.

2472
03:11:42,870 --> 03:11:43,750
Maybe like here.

2473
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:00,230
Why are they so slow?

2474
03:12:00,490 --> 03:12:01,230
Oh, I see them right there.

2475
03:12:02,870 --> 03:12:04,050
Bink, bink.

2476
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:08,150
Where are they?

2477
03:12:09,530 --> 03:12:10,110
Oh.

2478
03:12:10,750 --> 03:12:12,770
I'm just gonna...

2479
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:13,130
Hmm.

2480
03:12:15,070 --> 03:12:17,010
Put on the sunglasses.

2481
03:12:20,410 --> 03:12:21,810
We'll just wait it up.

2482
03:12:23,570 --> 03:12:24,850
You did not.

2483
03:12:25,790 --> 03:12:26,710
You did not.

2484
03:12:27,410 --> 03:12:28,170
No, you didn't.

2485
03:12:28,690 --> 03:12:30,070
Yeah, you're seeing things.

2486
03:12:30,210 --> 03:12:30,410
I see.

2487
03:12:31,450 --> 03:12:32,130
I see.

2488
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:34,510
Yeah, you don't see, actually.

2489
03:12:35,630 --> 03:12:36,550
Stupid liar?

2490
03:12:38,270 --> 03:12:44,190
I don't think the sunglasses change your vision at all.

2491
03:12:53,170 --> 03:12:54,590
The caution's almost over.

2492
03:12:54,750 --> 03:12:54,950
It's okay.

2493
03:12:55,790 --> 03:12:58,930
I think I just go back into this room where Sokolov was.

2494
03:13:01,130 --> 03:13:02,830
I don't remember this part very well.

2495
03:13:07,270 --> 03:13:10,710
I hear him, but I don't see where he's standing.

2496
03:13:12,750 --> 03:13:13,890
Return to your position.

2497
03:13:19,630 --> 03:13:20,290
There they go.

2498
03:13:22,570 --> 03:13:23,290
Is anyone still here?

2499
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:25,450
I want that.

2500
03:13:26,230 --> 03:13:27,030
I want the items.

2501
03:13:28,210 --> 03:13:28,870
I'm just going to drop.

2502
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:31,370
If I have to fight anybody, we'll just see QCM.

2503
03:13:34,290 --> 03:13:34,690
Drop.

2504
03:13:35,730 --> 03:13:36,290
No, not climb.

2505
03:13:36,850 --> 03:13:37,310
I'm stupid.

2506
03:13:39,410 --> 03:13:40,830
Oh, sorry, I didn't see somebody raided me.

2507
03:13:41,090 --> 03:13:41,330
Thank you.

2508
03:13:43,030 --> 03:13:43,190
Whoa.

2509
03:13:44,450 --> 03:13:46,570
Thank you so- oh, gave me okay.

2510
03:13:47,570 --> 03:13:48,230
Thank you.

2511
03:13:48,430 --> 03:13:49,130
Thanks for the raid.

2512
03:13:49,330 --> 03:13:50,090
Whoever raided me.

2513
03:13:50,490 --> 03:13:51,090
Thank you so much.

2514
03:13:51,710 --> 03:13:52,970
We got the box.

2515
03:13:53,290 --> 03:13:54,030
We got copper box.

2516
03:13:56,210 --> 03:13:57,450
We got the box.

2517
03:13:57,590 --> 03:13:58,750
I got smoke grenades.

2518
03:13:59,170 --> 03:13:59,490
Oh, shit.

2519
03:13:59,750 --> 03:14:00,070
Oh, shit.

2520
03:14:00,750 --> 03:14:00,970
Oh, shit.

2521
03:14:01,290 --> 03:14:01,470
Oh, shit.

2522
03:14:01,770 --> 03:14:01,870
Oh, shit.

2523
03:14:02,290 --> 03:14:02,690
Oh, shit.

2524
03:14:03,910 --> 03:14:04,790
There are still guys here.

2525
03:14:05,730 --> 03:14:07,890
I keep thinking that's a guy.

2526
03:14:08,530 --> 03:14:09,070
It's definitely not.

2527
03:14:13,240 --> 03:14:13,760
Mine detector.

2528
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:16,460
The mine D.

2529
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:21,040
Where in the heck do I meet her?

2530
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:21,780
I don't remember.

2531
03:14:26,650 --> 03:14:27,730
Thermal goggles.

2532
03:14:40,150 --> 03:14:42,250
There's so many little critters underneath me.

2533
03:14:43,690 --> 03:14:44,650
Oh, there we go.

2534
03:14:44,650 --> 03:14:49,230
I was like, how do I trigger the cutscene again?

2535
03:14:49,310 --> 03:14:49,850
I don't remember.

2536
03:14:50,450 --> 03:14:51,010
I'm stupid.

2537
03:14:55,710 --> 03:14:56,190
RB,

2538
03:14:59,370 --> 03:14:59,710
RB, RB.

2539
03:15:03,230 --> 03:15:04,950
Thank you so much for the thank you.

2540
03:15:05,090 --> 03:15:05,630
Thank you.

2541
03:15:06,610 --> 03:15:07,530
Sorry I'm late.

2542
03:15:09,350 --> 03:15:09,810
Cut the engine.

2543
03:15:10,250 --> 03:15:10,930
They'll hear us.

2544
03:15:11,830 --> 03:15:12,930
Are you the agent they sent?

2545
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:17,750
I thought you were supposed to be a man.

2546
03:15:17,770 --> 03:15:19,810
Adam couldn't make it.

2547
03:15:20,250 --> 03:15:20,770
Nice and hydrated.

2548
03:15:20,990 --> 03:15:22,350
Yeah, I gotta go after this cutscene.

2549
03:15:22,610 --> 03:15:22,950
I'll go.

2550
03:15:23,890 --> 03:15:24,970
Who are the Patriots?

2551
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:26,190
Uh-oh.

2552
03:15:26,890 --> 03:15:28,090
Who are the Patriots?

2553
03:15:30,970 --> 03:15:32,050
Answer me!

2554
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:41,360
Get down!

2555
03:15:42,700 --> 03:15:45,320
I think my computer's starting to get fried.

2556
03:15:58,370 --> 03:15:59,610
Holy cow!

2557
03:16:05,810 --> 03:16:16,930
Gumbar PC There Is your answer Not really Not really

2558
03:16:22,100 --> 03:16:29,500
This area is perfect for pistol vintages Oh she's so Oh my gosh she's so pretty

2559
03:16:43,940 --> 03:16:52,400
Just staring straight at him Thank you The name's Eva Here Oh, they kept the old name.

2560
03:16:52,580 --> 03:16:53,200
That's so interesting.

2561
03:16:59,470 --> 03:17:00,350
Excuse me.

2562
03:17:01,730 --> 03:17:05,230
He just doesn't even try to look up at her.

2563
03:17:05,630 --> 03:17:06,030
Oh, wait.

2564
03:17:06,110 --> 03:17:07,730
I love this boat so much.

2565
03:17:11,610 --> 03:17:13,450
I want to see him nerd out.

2566
03:17:13,970 --> 03:17:14,810
What happened to Adam?

2567
03:17:16,010 --> 03:17:16,890
What's your code name?

2568
03:17:19,130 --> 03:17:20,030
It's Snake.

2569
03:17:21,270 --> 03:17:22,110
Snake, huh?

2570
03:17:24,430 --> 03:17:25,310
Well, I'm Eva.

2571
03:17:26,490 --> 03:17:27,530
Are you here to tempt me?

2572
03:17:31,490 --> 03:17:31,990
Eva.

2573
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:33,650
What happened to Adam?

2574
03:17:35,470 --> 03:17:36,230
Now he's shy.

2575
03:17:36,670 --> 03:17:38,070
Colonel Vogan is a very suspicious man.

2576
03:17:38,250 --> 03:17:40,610
He decided Adam wasn't the right person for this mission.

2577
03:17:41,750 --> 03:17:42,490
And you were?

2578
03:17:43,910 --> 03:17:44,430
Yes.

2579
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:45,150
Why?

2580
03:17:46,390 --> 03:17:48,510
Because I can do things he can't.

2581
03:17:51,850 --> 03:17:54,410
I heard you used to be a codebreaker for the NSC.

2582
03:17:54,430 --> 03:18:25,630
say i was four years ago i defected to the soviet union with adam mauser military the broom handle his little smirks are killing me nice to have when you're on a you held it sideways and used the muzzle jump to create a horizontal sweep that was impressive bet you've never seen that technique in the west it's imitation isn't it such a nerd i love him it's Ah

2583
03:18:30,470 --> 03:18:34,330
Don't worry though the one I've got for you is American made

2584
03:18:37,490 --> 03:18:42,170
Oh Yeah, let him 45 huh?

2585
03:18:43,890 --> 03:18:45,470
Oh Yeah, handle that.

2586
03:18:46,110 --> 03:18:48,670
Oh, oh, yeah, incredible.

2587
03:18:49,250 --> 03:18:50,930
Oh, yeah, do you like it?

2588
03:18:52,030 --> 03:19:22,350
The feeding ramp is polished to a mirror sheen the slide's been reinforced and the interlock with the frame is tightened for added precision the sight system is original too the thumb safety is extended to make it easier on the finger a long tight trigger with non-slip grooves a ring hammer the base of the trigger guard's been filed down for a higher grip oh yeah and not only that nearly every part of this gun has been expertly crafted and customized I should have put on the Kettoton mask for this

2589
03:19:25,930 --> 03:19:58,430
he's nerding out I grabbed it from a Western munitions armory it probably used to belong to one of your officers and there are more where that came from their uniform our uniform you had this with you didn't you better take this too what's that a disguise to make you look like a scientist a disguise Yes.

2590
03:19:59,070 --> 03:20:00,890
You're here to rescue Sokolov, right?

2591
03:20:01,090 --> 03:20:02,790
Sokolov's still safe then.

2592
03:20:03,350 --> 03:20:03,850
Look at her tummy.

2593
03:20:04,010 --> 03:20:05,990
He's being forced to continue his work on the Shagohad.

2594
03:20:06,450 --> 03:20:06,750
Where?

2595
03:20:07,130 --> 03:20:07,770
Oh my god.

2596
03:20:07,970 --> 03:20:08,390
At the lab.

2597
03:20:08,970 --> 03:20:10,510
They've got a whole army of scientists.

2598
03:20:10,710 --> 03:20:11,910
They're developing new weapons.

2599
03:20:12,350 --> 03:20:14,850
Can I do experiments on you, ma'am?

2600
03:20:15,450 --> 03:20:17,550
You might be able to sneak in.

2601
03:20:21,090 --> 03:20:22,550
Can we get Sokolov out of there?

2602
03:20:23,290 --> 03:20:24,390
We'll see, won't we?

2603
03:20:25,430 --> 03:20:27,050
Tell me how to get to the lab.

2604
03:20:27,970 --> 03:20:55,590
the safest way in is from the rear oh from the rear first you'll need to head north through the jungle you'll come to a heliport used for shipping materials pass the heliport and continue north and there will be a large crevice descend into that area and you'll reach a cave move through the cave and you will arrive at a mangrove swamp my god after the swamp there'll be a warehouse me in my stupid grenade camo.

2605
03:20:55,750 --> 03:20:57,610
You'll come out just south of the lab.

2606
03:20:57,810 --> 03:20:58,610
Ha ha ha ha.

2607
03:20:58,770 --> 03:20:59,630
Got it.

2608
03:21:01,090 --> 03:21:03,930
It looks like I have caramel apples all over me.

2609
03:21:04,610 --> 03:21:08,550
In close range combat, a knife can sometimes be more useful than a gun.

2610
03:21:09,030 --> 03:21:09,190
True.

2611
03:21:09,370 --> 03:21:13,370
By doing this, I'll be able to hold a knife at the same time and still keep the gun steady.

2612
03:21:14,570 --> 03:21:17,890
That way, I can instantly switch between a gun battle and a knife fight.

2613
03:21:25,510 --> 03:21:26,850
Right, let's get going.

2614
03:21:26,850 --> 03:21:27,670
Wait a minute.

2615
03:21:28,510 --> 03:21:28,950
What now?

2616
03:21:29,570 --> 03:21:30,530
You must be tired.

2617
03:21:31,050 --> 03:21:32,270
Why don't you take a little rest?

2618
03:21:33,030 --> 03:21:34,010
I'll be fine.

2619
03:21:36,570 --> 03:21:38,410
Oh, immediately is not fine.

2620
03:21:38,570 --> 03:21:39,950
You'll never make it in your condition.

2621
03:21:41,790 --> 03:21:42,830
It's a jungle out there.

2622
03:21:43,090 --> 03:21:44,710
Yeah, and I'm a beast.

2623
03:21:45,070 --> 03:21:46,490
There's still an hour before dawn.

2624
03:21:47,970 --> 03:21:50,270
It's dangerous to be out in the jungle at night without a guide.

2625
03:21:51,210 --> 03:21:52,050
What about you?

2626
03:21:52,450 --> 03:21:53,690
I have to get back.

2627
03:21:54,230 --> 03:21:55,490
I can't be gone for too long.

2628
03:21:55,490 --> 03:22:26,140
they'll start to suspect something don't worry I'll keep you updated over the radio that's it my orders are to provide you with information nothing more you look disappointed all right then I'll do something special for you yeah yeah

2629
03:22:29,900 --> 03:22:33,140
I'll stand watch until dawn now be a good boy and lie down

2630
03:22:39,460 --> 03:22:48,780
What's the matter I don't know you well enough to trust you true how well do you have to know me to trust me?

2631
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:52,840
I don't know if I can trust anybody

2632
03:22:56,320 --> 03:23:01,860
The beginning of his his of his eternal trust issues.

2633
03:23:02,900 --> 03:23:03,660
Gonna get that?

2634
03:23:03,900 --> 03:23:05,020
Battle against everybody.

2635
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:09,520
My little baby, boy, I just wanna hug him.

2636
03:23:12,590 --> 03:23:13,770
She's right, Snake.

2637
03:23:14,110 --> 03:23:15,070
You should get some sleep.

2638
03:23:15,910 --> 03:23:16,610
Stop eavesdropping.

2639
03:23:17,110 --> 03:23:17,130
Ugh.

2640
03:23:18,930 --> 03:23:19,450
Eavesdropping.

2641
03:23:19,510 --> 03:23:19,630
Eavesdropping.

2642
03:23:19,650 --> 03:23:22,310
Whenever you save the game and quit, you'll go to sleep.

2643
03:23:22,970 --> 03:23:24,930
Sleeping allows you to gain back stamina naturally.

2644
03:23:25,610 --> 03:23:29,670
Depending on how long you sleep, you may also recover naturally from sickness and injury.

2645
03:23:29,890 --> 03:23:30,810
I like that she's mansplaining.

2646
03:23:31,130 --> 03:23:31,690
and sleep.

2647
03:23:32,050 --> 03:23:33,930
The best thing to do is just get some sleep.

2648
03:23:34,610 --> 03:23:36,210
So do yourself a favor and take a nap.

2649
03:23:36,670 --> 03:23:37,910
Doctor's orders, okay?

2650
03:23:38,690 --> 03:23:40,030
Yeah, okay.

2651
03:23:41,710 --> 03:23:43,270
Eee, bud dropping.

2652
03:23:45,670 --> 03:23:47,290
You're like, just stop playing the game.

2653
03:23:48,210 --> 03:23:48,930
Take a break.

2654
03:23:50,530 --> 03:23:52,050
She's talking to us too.

2655
03:23:59,350 --> 03:24:01,270
Miss Little Bratz.

2656
03:24:22,390 --> 03:24:23,990
Look, sneaky.

2657
03:24:25,770 --> 03:24:26,290
Suspicious.

2658
03:24:28,390 --> 03:24:29,210
Good morning, Minto!

2659
03:24:35,150 --> 03:24:37,810
I don't know which angle is better, honestly.

2660
03:24:42,100 --> 03:24:42,960
What's the matter?

2661
03:24:43,900 --> 03:24:44,540
We're surrounded.

2662
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:47,500
I see four of them.

2663
03:24:55,550 --> 03:24:56,570
We've got company.

2664
03:24:56,710 --> 03:24:57,690
It's the Ocelot unit.

2665
03:24:58,710 --> 03:24:59,490
Let's get out of here.

2666
03:24:59,630 --> 03:24:59,870
Hurry.

2667
03:25:01,470 --> 03:25:15,730
don't forget your gear okay here give me a hand I love this game I love metal

2668
03:25:18,930 --> 03:25:30,430
gear we can use this to get to the basement that's not a basement that is a crawl space I'll

2669
03:25:33,720 --> 03:25:39,960
get past them on my bike I'll call you later okay I'll keep them busy.

2670
03:25:39,980 --> 03:25:40,260
Okay.

2671
03:25:44,320 --> 03:25:45,940
Don't get dying on me now.

2672
03:25:50,630 --> 03:25:50,890
Huh?

2673
03:26:01,550 --> 03:26:02,650
Wait, I want to get in there too.

2674
03:26:02,990 --> 03:26:03,850
Wait, how do I get in there?

2675
03:26:04,490 --> 03:26:05,870
How do I open it?

2676
03:26:06,050 --> 03:26:06,930
Wait, how do I open this?

2677
03:26:07,350 --> 03:26:07,510
Wait.

2678
03:26:08,050 --> 03:26:08,430
Oh, shoot.

2679
03:26:08,570 --> 03:26:08,970
I don't remember.

2680
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:16,160
Make some noise.

2681
03:26:19,740 --> 03:26:20,100
Move.

2682
03:26:20,540 --> 03:26:20,900
Move.

2683
03:26:24,910 --> 03:26:25,310
Triangle?

2684
03:26:26,130 --> 03:26:27,250
But I think an action...

2685
03:26:27,250 --> 03:26:29,010
Wait, is an action button Y or A?

2686
03:26:29,150 --> 03:26:30,390
I think they changed it in there.

2687
03:26:31,230 --> 03:26:31,990
I don't know.

2688
03:26:33,130 --> 03:26:34,550
Wait, they're about to come in?

2689
03:26:35,570 --> 03:26:36,630
How did they hear that?

2690
03:26:36,710 --> 03:26:37,730
They heard...

2691
03:26:42,400 --> 03:26:43,980
Oh, this is messed up.

2692
03:26:56,080 --> 03:26:58,480
I wonder if I should go out and just CQC all of them.

2693
03:26:58,640 --> 03:26:59,540
Let's try it.

2694
03:26:59,640 --> 03:27:00,200
I see them!

2695
03:27:01,300 --> 03:27:01,940
Oh, gosh.

2696
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,260
Up!

2697
03:27:08,530 --> 03:27:08,950
Get up!

2698
03:27:09,030 --> 03:27:09,190
Get up!

2699
03:27:09,210 --> 03:27:09,910
For real.

2700
03:27:10,490 --> 03:27:10,930
Ow!

2701
03:27:11,770 --> 03:27:12,510
Let's see if we can see him.

2702
03:27:13,670 --> 03:27:14,610
Where's the other guy?

2703
03:27:14,770 --> 03:27:14,870
Oh!

2704
03:27:15,570 --> 03:27:15,890
Jeez.

2705
03:27:16,530 --> 03:27:17,930
Your guys are down there!

2706
03:27:22,550 --> 03:27:24,650
Okay, we got five left.

2707
03:27:26,030 --> 03:27:26,090
Oh.

2708
03:27:26,470 --> 03:27:27,270
I need a cure.

2709
03:27:30,970 --> 03:27:32,410
It kind of worked.

2710
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:38,650
Bandage.

2711
03:27:40,070 --> 03:27:40,710
Oink.

2712
03:27:41,770 --> 03:27:44,790
Okay, to be fair, though, they also go in the opposite order.

2713
03:27:45,070 --> 03:27:45,690
Oh, gunshot.

2714
03:27:45,810 --> 03:27:46,810
Oh, sheesh.

2715
03:27:47,390 --> 03:27:48,470
Um, bullet.

2716
03:27:48,670 --> 03:27:50,270
How do I get the bullet out with the knife?

2717
03:27:51,030 --> 03:27:52,050
And then I'm bleeding.

2718
03:27:53,530 --> 03:27:54,410
Stop bleeding.

2719
03:27:54,810 --> 03:27:56,410
And then I apply the bandage.

2720
03:27:56,990 --> 03:27:58,230
I should disinfect it.

2721
03:27:58,870 --> 03:27:59,850
It's out of order.

2722
03:28:01,770 --> 03:28:03,850
Oh, don't touch the sides.

2723
03:28:03,970 --> 03:28:05,750
Use a knife to remove a bullet.

2724
03:28:06,830 --> 03:28:07,170
Cool.

2725
03:28:07,910 --> 03:28:08,490
All right, come here.

2726
03:28:10,410 --> 03:28:10,850
Hmm.

2727
03:28:12,830 --> 03:28:13,830
I can't see anything.

2728
03:28:22,230 --> 03:28:23,690
Anybody else gonna come in here or...

2729
03:28:24,710 --> 03:28:25,890
Can't tell if they do or not.

2730
03:28:26,010 --> 03:28:27,690
I don't know if they'll just...

2731
03:28:28,930 --> 03:28:29,770
I'm camping.

2732
03:28:32,410 --> 03:28:35,790
I'm, like, actually moving my head to distract the area.

2733
03:28:36,730 --> 03:28:37,390
Nobody yet.

2734
03:28:37,470 --> 03:28:37,910
Uggy.

2735
03:28:40,230 --> 03:28:41,750
Let me try opening this again.

2736
03:28:43,410 --> 03:28:45,290
Oh, now it gives me the prong.

2737
03:28:48,610 --> 03:28:51,550
Of course now it gives it to me.

2738
03:28:55,830 --> 03:28:57,050
Wait, what about my stuff?

2739
03:28:57,470 --> 03:28:58,970
Oh, I think I need to equip it, huh?

2740
03:28:59,630 --> 03:29:00,390
Let's see, backpack.

2741
03:29:01,890 --> 03:29:02,370
Aha!

2742
03:29:02,830 --> 03:29:03,550
There we go.

2743
03:29:09,410 --> 03:29:10,910
When did I get these frogs?

2744
03:29:15,690 --> 03:29:17,690
I saw him.

2745
03:29:25,750 --> 03:29:27,330
Oh, I have no suppressor on this.

2746
03:29:33,810 --> 03:29:33,990
Oops!

2747
03:29:34,730 --> 03:29:34,730
Oops!

2748
03:29:35,530 --> 03:29:36,410
Oh god!

2749
03:29:36,710 --> 03:29:37,130
Back up!

2750
03:29:37,610 --> 03:29:38,090
Back up!

2751
03:29:51,470 --> 03:29:53,030
What's so funny?

2752
03:29:54,030 --> 03:29:55,430
How does this affect?

2753
03:29:57,250 --> 03:29:57,990
Bleeding.

2754
03:29:59,130 --> 03:29:59,670
Bandage.

2755
03:30:02,770 --> 03:30:04,210
He'll pass out eventually.

2756
03:30:06,990 --> 03:30:08,550
I think I got him at the leg eventually.

2757
03:30:09,230 --> 03:30:10,570
That was so funny.

2758
03:30:15,850 --> 03:30:18,430
Wait, what if I...

2759
03:30:18,430 --> 03:30:20,810
Oh, there he goes.

2760
03:30:21,210 --> 03:30:21,890
What's wrong?

2761
03:30:22,190 --> 03:30:22,290
Oh.

2762
03:30:23,410 --> 03:30:25,110
Wait, maybe I can go out and get his ass.

2763
03:30:29,490 --> 03:30:31,150
Are you going to go check on your friend?

2764
03:30:34,610 --> 03:30:36,870
Are you gonna look at him?

2765
03:30:38,310 --> 03:30:38,990
Nothing here.

2766
03:30:41,330 --> 03:30:41,970
Thank you, Robin.

2767
03:30:44,090 --> 03:30:44,830
Where is he?

2768
03:30:45,750 --> 03:30:46,990
Oh, there he is.

2769
03:30:49,130 --> 03:30:50,010
Oh, gosh.

2770
03:30:51,050 --> 03:30:51,690
Wait, come here.

2771
03:30:51,850 --> 03:30:52,470
Go come here.

2772
03:30:55,190 --> 03:30:55,630
Holy.

2773
03:30:58,170 --> 03:30:59,450
Oh, I keep pressing Y.

2774
03:30:59,870 --> 03:31:01,150
I'm so used to it as an action button.

2775
03:31:02,030 --> 03:31:03,090
I see him.

2776
03:31:03,870 --> 03:31:05,630
I don't see you!

2777
03:31:05,650 --> 03:31:07,170
I don't see you!

2778
03:31:07,810 --> 03:31:08,350
Oops!

2779
03:31:10,430 --> 03:31:11,070
Look it up.

2780
03:31:11,170 --> 03:31:11,610
Get up, Snake.

2781
03:31:16,490 --> 03:31:18,250
Okay, one more guy.

2782
03:31:19,070 --> 03:31:19,350
Where is he

2783
03:31:23,210 --> 03:31:23,310
at?

2784
03:31:27,910 --> 03:31:29,410
He knows I'm here.

2785
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:32,310
Two can play at that game.

2786
03:31:34,510 --> 03:31:36,610
And only one of us has unlimited supply.

2787
03:31:37,570 --> 03:31:38,370
Where are you though?

2788
03:31:41,540 --> 03:31:41,880
Hello?

2789
03:31:57,150 --> 03:31:58,890
I should cure.

2790
03:32:02,150 --> 03:32:03,510
I keep getting shot.

2791
03:32:07,510 --> 03:32:09,210
I keep getting shot.

2792
03:32:13,650 --> 03:32:15,470
Yeah, the Gakko is right there.

2793
03:32:15,990 --> 03:32:18,650
Actually, well, I'll shoot him after once all these guys are down.

2794
03:32:20,190 --> 03:32:21,170
Where are you?

2795
03:32:30,750 --> 03:32:32,250
I just gotta go look for him.

2796
03:32:37,050 --> 03:32:40,870
I keep seeing that thing right there and thinking it's a guy.

2797
03:32:42,530 --> 03:32:43,310
Hello?

2798
03:32:46,620 --> 03:32:47,400
Are you inside?

2799
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:51,240
Stepping so carefully over your bodies?

2800
03:32:52,620 --> 03:32:53,020
Oh my gosh.

2801
03:33:06,960 --> 03:33:07,740
Hello?

2802
03:33:23,770 --> 03:33:25,610
We're gonna spray and pray.

2803
03:33:26,550 --> 03:33:31,910
I see

2804
03:33:36,640 --> 03:33:38,200
Kero-Tan right there too.

2805
03:33:46,640 --> 03:33:47,540
Oh, I see his feet.

2806
03:33:51,980 --> 03:33:53,940
Can I get him in through here?

2807
03:33:55,020 --> 03:33:56,880
He's dancing or something.

2808
03:33:57,660 --> 03:33:57,660
I

2809
03:34:02,010 --> 03:34:03,630
think I got his feet.

2810
03:34:09,910 --> 03:34:10,790
Oh there.

2811
03:34:11,330 --> 03:34:11,670
There we go.

2812
03:34:11,850 --> 03:34:12,530
Now we can really get him.

2813
03:34:12,710 --> 03:34:13,170
Oh, oops.

2814
03:34:20,630 --> 03:34:21,770
Where are you unloading?

2815
03:34:30,470 --> 03:34:31,370
Down boy, down.

2816
03:34:39,660 --> 03:34:41,940
I know I got your leg.

2817
03:35:06,480 --> 03:35:07,200
Really?

2818
03:35:07,720 --> 03:35:08,000
Okay.

2819
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:10,780
Oh.

2820
03:35:12,540 --> 03:35:14,600
All I had to do was wait two seconds.

2821
03:35:27,110 --> 03:35:28,490
It's so funny.

2822
03:35:28,770 --> 03:35:29,210
Okay, wait.

2823
03:35:29,570 --> 03:35:30,910
My wound is open.

2824
03:35:32,610 --> 03:35:35,470
This, in fact, uh...

2825
03:35:37,810 --> 03:35:38,350
Suture.

2826
03:35:38,990 --> 03:35:40,570
It's a bandage.

2827
03:35:44,010 --> 03:35:45,710
Okay, now we're fine.

2828
03:35:45,870 --> 03:35:46,990
Now everything's good.

2829
03:35:48,790 --> 03:35:50,270
Give me your stuff.

2830
03:35:52,970 --> 03:35:53,510
Seabed.

2831
03:35:54,130 --> 03:35:54,810
I'll take that.

2832
03:35:55,990 --> 03:35:57,630
Alright, now we loot the place.

2833
03:36:00,390 --> 03:36:02,230
Why don't I have a suppressor anymore?

2834
03:36:02,410 --> 03:36:04,530
Evil, why would you give me a gun without a suppressor?

2835
03:36:04,970 --> 03:36:06,150
For a sneaking mission.

2836
03:36:06,910 --> 03:36:09,150
Why would you be so cruel to me?

2837
03:36:11,010 --> 03:36:12,350
Why would you be so mean?

2838
03:36:15,850 --> 03:36:15,950
Oh.

2839
03:36:17,110 --> 03:36:18,010
Smoke tree.

2840
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:25,370
So silly.

2841
03:36:30,110 --> 03:36:32,610
Ooh, what did you have on you?

2842
03:36:32,930 --> 03:36:33,710
A rations.

2843
03:36:38,880 --> 03:36:39,360
Wait.

2844
03:36:40,960 --> 03:36:42,020
Aren't you the guy I just picked up?

2845
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:42,220
Nope.

2846
03:36:43,980 --> 03:36:44,940
What's WPG?

2847
03:36:49,070 --> 03:36:49,550
Water.

2848
03:36:49,830 --> 03:36:50,710
I'll get water.

2849
03:36:50,910 --> 03:36:51,810
I need to get water.

2850
03:36:52,130 --> 03:36:52,690
Yes, thank you.

2851
03:36:53,090 --> 03:36:53,830
I need to get water.

2852
03:36:54,050 --> 03:36:54,890
I do need to get water.

2853
03:36:55,450 --> 03:36:55,950
Soucher kit.

2854
03:36:56,230 --> 03:36:56,310
Perfect.

2855
03:36:56,530 --> 03:36:57,570
I keep using those.

2856
03:37:00,150 --> 03:37:01,850
White phosphorus grenade.

2857
03:37:06,090 --> 03:37:06,570
Yeah!

2858
03:37:07,190 --> 03:37:07,850
There we go.

2859
03:37:10,130 --> 03:37:11,610
Water, water, water.

2860
03:37:13,970 --> 03:37:15,810
Ammo, I'll take that too.

2861
03:37:20,670 --> 03:37:21,310
A battery?

2862
03:37:23,510 --> 03:37:24,490
Can't remember how many of...

2863
03:37:24,490 --> 03:37:25,610
Maybe just two times.

2864
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:29,670
Med?

2865
03:37:30,550 --> 03:37:31,290
Pazesamines.

2866
03:37:38,390 --> 03:37:39,130
Battery.

2867
03:37:43,800 --> 03:37:45,200
Kedotan was here and...

2868
03:37:45,220 --> 03:37:46,340
Gakko is upstairs.

2869
03:37:53,640 --> 03:37:56,080
One of the rare times we get both of them.

2870
03:37:58,100 --> 03:38:00,800
Oh, I think my PC is, like, really dying.

2871
03:38:06,840 --> 03:38:08,120
Oh, there's a guy here.

2872
03:38:09,020 --> 03:38:10,120
Give me your stuff.

2873
03:38:11,620 --> 03:38:16,400
It's hard to tell frame rate stuff.

2874
03:38:17,780 --> 03:38:34,340
with not only just streamers but also vtubers because we have extra tech that we use oh he gave us ramen nice I got the locker in Sokolov's just

2875
03:38:40,030 --> 03:38:54,650
a few frame drops it's mostly me honestly it's mostly me but yeah So far, it's been...

2876
03:38:54,650 --> 03:38:56,850
I've been waiting for this moment.

2877
03:39:06,260 --> 03:39:07,200
That's it!

2878
03:39:08,720 --> 03:39:10,140
That's the stance!

2879
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:11,320
That's the stance!

2880
03:39:11,980 --> 03:39:12,920
I don't think so.

2881
03:39:15,240 --> 03:39:16,600
That's the...

2882
03:39:16,600 --> 03:39:18,240
A female spy?

2883
03:39:18,540 --> 03:39:19,820
Lost a lot, you dog.

2884
03:39:23,870 --> 03:39:25,630
This bitch is wearing perfume!

2885
03:39:29,170 --> 03:40:24,350

2886
03:40:31,190 --> 03:40:32,590

03:40:39,670 --> 03:40:40,190
Yeah!

2888
03:40:53,980 --> 03:40:55,320
Six shots.

2889
03:40:56,300 --> 03:40:58,280
That thing only carries six shots.

2890
03:40:58,940 --> 03:41:00,260
The Makarov carries eight.

2891
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:03,460
You have to get a feel for how many you have left.

2892
03:41:04,220 --> 03:41:05,100
Oh gosh.

2893
03:41:06,460 --> 03:41:11,320
His brain chemistry is literally and this is a high class weapon.

2894
03:41:12,080 --> 03:41:13,440
It's not meant for shooting people.

2895
03:41:14,600 --> 03:41:15,580
Six shots.

2896
03:41:16,980 --> 03:41:17,560
Wow.

2897
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:18,180
Wow.

2898
03:41:25,390 --> 03:41:27,090
This isn't over yet.

2899
03:41:33,570 --> 03:41:34,830
He's still young.

2900
03:41:35,630 --> 03:41:38,090
Look at the way he runs.

2901
03:41:38,330 --> 03:41:39,690
You'll regret stopping me.

2902
03:41:40,030 --> 03:41:41,910
He's still young us a lot.

2903
03:41:42,570 --> 03:41:43,170
Damn it.

2904
03:41:43,690 --> 03:41:45,450
I've got to get back before he does.

2905
03:41:48,430 --> 03:41:49,370
Get out of here!

2906
03:41:55,740 --> 03:41:56,800
So cool.

2907
03:41:57,320 --> 03:41:58,480
Eva's so cool.

2908
03:42:02,480 --> 03:42:04,420
Oh wait, I didn't get to get Gakko.

2909
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:05,760
Will still let me?

2910
03:42:06,500 --> 03:42:06,720
Yeah.

2911
03:42:14,170 --> 03:42:15,220
Six shots.

2912
03:42:21,790 --> 03:42:23,430
What a woman.

2913
03:42:27,230 --> 03:42:29,210
What a woman.

2914
03:42:39,820 --> 03:42:41,780
Now he can put on the suppressor.

2915
03:42:43,640 --> 03:42:44,240
Good!

2916
03:43:00,320 --> 03:43:03,060
Actually, before we go onwards...

2917
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:04,600
Water!

2918
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:09,060
Water time.

2919
03:43:09,240 --> 03:43:10,160
Water break, everybody.

2920
03:43:12,780 --> 03:43:13,760
Water break.

2921
03:43:14,100 --> 03:43:15,320
Water break, water break.

2922
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:17,540
I will be...

2923
03:43:17,540 --> 03:43:18,800
Or be...

2924
03:43:18,800 --> 03:43:20,460
Actually, maybe we can... hold on.

2925
03:43:21,320 --> 03:43:22,240
No, not that.

2926
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:26,500
Let's listen.

2927
03:43:26,520 --> 03:43:53,100
to somebody talk i'll save and you guys can listen saving the game snake yep yep save him okay snake have you heard of it came from outer space yeah you told me already so this astronomer sees a meteor but it's really an alien spaceship right and the aliens start replacing the townspeople with clones and forcing them to help repair the ship the 3d effects were quite realistic

2928
03:43:56,940 --> 03:43:58,500
No, you don't get it.

2929
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:00,640
Precisely because it's realistic.

2930
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:02,980
With the images jumping out of the screen at you.

2931
03:44:03,420 --> 03:44:05,080
It makes for a nice escape from reality.

2932
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:09,220
I have to admit it made my eyes tired, but it was really intense.

2933
03:44:09,960 --> 03:44:12,440
Unfortunately, they don't make very many of those movies anymore.

2934
03:44:13,240 --> 03:44:14,120
When did it come out?

2935
03:44:14,580 --> 03:44:17,960
I was still in college, so probably about 10 years ago?

2936
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:19,860
Guess I'm out of luck then.

2937
03:44:20,500 --> 03:44:24,280
You know, they're coming out with household versions of video cassette recorders.

2938
03:44:24,280 --> 03:44:27,060
One day you'll be able to see old movies anytime you want.

2939
03:44:28,040 --> 03:44:30,200
It'll be like having a movie theater in your own home.

2940
03:44:31,820 --> 03:44:35,460
It's like if you had a record with movie film etched onto it instead of music.

2941
03:44:35,860 --> 03:44:36,820
It'll work the same way.

2942
03:44:37,340 --> 03:44:38,000
You're kidding.

2943
03:44:38,960 --> 03:44:39,620
No, really.

2944
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:43,220
And someday they might make movies where you control the characters yourself.

2945
03:44:43,860 --> 03:44:44,800
Sounds like magic.

2946
03:44:45,500 --> 03:44:46,180
It'll happen.

2947
03:44:46,640 --> 03:44:48,400
Make sure you stay alive to see it, Snake.

2948
03:46:41,320 --> 03:46:42,120
I'm back.

2949
03:46:42,320 --> 03:46:43,020
Sorry about that.

2950
03:46:43,100 --> 03:46:44,640
I was also looking for my voicemails.

2951
03:46:46,020 --> 03:46:51,860
I'm okay give me one second I'm gonna check something on my computer I'm

2952
03:46:55,630 --> 03:47:08,350
gonna give it a little more breathing oh it's high oh my computer's high whoa whoa whoa whoa you're okay computer you're okay

2953
03:47:16,340 --> 03:47:24,300
okay hot it's really hot in my room oh hello

2954
03:47:31,780 --> 03:47:33,260
Let's get back to it.

2955
03:47:33,660 --> 03:47:34,960
What did paramedic talk about?

2956
03:47:38,860 --> 03:47:39,820
Oh, you're okay, computer.

2957
03:47:40,040 --> 03:47:40,380
You're okay.

2958
03:47:40,860 --> 03:47:41,520
You got this.

2959
03:47:46,380 --> 03:47:48,480
Yeah, I have an external fan on.

2960
03:47:49,160 --> 03:47:50,860
Movies, just movies.

2961
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:53,720
Oh, boy.

2962
03:47:55,740 --> 03:47:56,640
Oh, boy.

2963
03:47:57,140 --> 03:47:58,540
came from outer space.

2964
03:48:00,680 --> 03:48:01,500
Movies in your home?

2965
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:01,840
Pfft.

2966
03:48:02,580 --> 03:48:04,800
Never gonna happen.

2967
03:48:07,640 --> 03:48:08,220
Impossible.

2968
03:48:11,280 --> 03:48:11,340
Ooh.

2969
03:48:14,820 --> 03:48:16,720
It'd be cute if there were turtles.

2970
03:48:18,600 --> 03:48:19,080
Wow.

2971
03:48:19,840 --> 03:48:20,880
Starting to rain.

2972
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:22,780
Stand tall.

2973
03:48:23,700 --> 03:48:24,760
Look at that big boy.

2974
03:48:26,320 --> 03:48:27,120
Stand a

2975
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:38,760
We gotta go find ourselves a hat.

2976
03:48:45,090 --> 03:48:45,850
Red and yellow.

2977
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:47,010
Kill a fellow.

2978
03:48:47,810 --> 03:48:48,330
Red and black.

2979
03:48:48,690 --> 03:48:49,210
Friend of Jack.

2980
03:48:56,530 --> 03:48:58,830
Oh, I can't take off the suppressor once I put it on.

2981
03:48:58,990 --> 03:48:59,530
That kind of sucks.

2982
03:49:03,430 --> 03:49:04,470
And we are Jack.

2983
03:49:04,650 --> 03:49:05,070
Exactly.

2984
03:49:05,310 --> 03:49:05,850
It works.

2985
03:49:07,590 --> 03:49:09,570
Oh wait, we're getting wet!

2986
03:49:11,670 --> 03:49:12,690
We're wet.

2987
03:49:12,910 --> 03:49:16,030
Oh no, it distorted his face.

2988
03:49:18,530 --> 03:49:25,990
It's like when you use those, you know, did you ever use those filters on Mac computers a long time ago?

2989
03:49:28,050 --> 03:49:29,990
That's what it reminds me of.

2990
03:49:31,490 --> 03:49:35,690
Okay, I was going to...

2991
03:49:39,230 --> 03:49:43,530
It said the crocsuit helps us swim better, no?

2992
03:49:44,190 --> 03:49:45,370
He looks so stupid.

2993
03:49:45,750 --> 03:49:47,130
Oh my god, it's so good.

2994
03:49:48,710 --> 03:49:49,550
Soggy snake.

2995
03:49:52,150 --> 03:49:52,610
Oh, whoa.

2996
03:49:53,370 --> 03:49:54,130
You're okay, computer.

2997
03:49:57,550 --> 03:49:58,770
Look at the...

2998
03:49:58,770 --> 03:50:00,510
Look at that frog just glide.

2999
03:50:00,870 --> 03:50:01,170
Oof.

3000
03:50:01,650 --> 03:50:01,990
Okay.

3001
03:50:05,070 --> 03:50:06,210
You're okay, computer.

3002
03:50:06,350 --> 03:50:06,970
You got this.

3003
03:50:07,150 --> 03:50:07,990
I believe in you.

3004
03:50:09,790 --> 03:50:11,230
Oh, that's happening.

3005
03:50:14,750 --> 03:50:15,990
Big fish.

3006
03:50:16,950 --> 03:50:17,890
Wait, I actually...

3007
03:50:17,890 --> 03:50:19,510
I actually don't know how to swim.

3008
03:50:21,030 --> 03:50:21,990
Wait, I...

3009
03:50:22,310 --> 03:50:22,990
Surface.

3010
03:50:29,380 --> 03:50:30,800
Okay, where... if I...

3011
03:50:30,800 --> 03:50:31,060
That!

3012
03:50:32,300 --> 03:50:35,840
If I were a crawcat, I would be over there.

3013
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:39,640
And if I were a place to...

3014
03:50:39,640 --> 03:50:40,860
get up...

3015
03:50:43,220 --> 03:50:44,520
Is this a...

3016
03:50:44,520 --> 03:50:45,380
I don't want to dive.

3017
03:50:45,540 --> 03:50:46,240
No, get on the land.

3018
03:50:46,360 --> 03:50:47,140
Yeah, yeah.

3019
03:50:49,140 --> 03:50:49,380
Oh!

3020
03:50:49,800 --> 03:50:50,000
Oh!

3021
03:50:50,320 --> 03:50:50,500
Oh!

3022
03:50:50,800 --> 03:50:51,940
I didn't see that guy there.

3023
03:50:53,640 --> 03:50:54,360
Like, IRL?

3024
03:50:54,600 --> 03:50:54,980
No!

3025
03:50:55,220 --> 03:50:55,980
I know how to swim.

3026
03:50:57,360 --> 03:50:59,320
I know I've got leeches on me, too.

3027
03:51:00,660 --> 03:51:02,160
I want to hear them kiss me, though.

3028
03:51:04,820 --> 03:51:07,220
This area is absolutely killing me.

3029
03:51:11,170 --> 03:51:12,510
Killing my PC, though.

3030
03:51:16,730 --> 03:51:18,930
We need to take, we need to eat a little snack.

3031
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:21,710
Oh, speaking of hunger.

3032
03:51:23,950 --> 03:51:26,650
But I also heard a little kiss.

3033
03:51:27,590 --> 03:51:28,930
I heard a kiss.

3034
03:51:30,290 --> 03:51:32,170
Let's get them leeches off of me.

3035
03:51:34,910 --> 03:51:37,050
They're like sticking straight out.

3036
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:38,890
I don't think that's how that works.

3037
03:51:42,830 --> 03:51:43,190
Oh wait.

3038
03:51:43,550 --> 03:51:43,950
How do I...

3039
03:51:43,950 --> 03:51:44,370
Oh, cigar.

3040
03:51:44,630 --> 03:51:45,070
I'm stupid.

3041
03:51:46,550 --> 03:51:47,010
Maria.

3042
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:54,480
That's what they say.

3043
03:51:55,340 --> 03:51:55,580
Hello?

3044
03:51:58,060 --> 03:51:59,520
Snake, are you there?

3045
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:00,200
Eva?

3046
03:52:00,900 --> 03:52:01,600
Did you miss me?

3047
03:52:02,120 --> 03:52:03,480
Did you make it without any trouble?

3048
03:52:04,300 --> 03:52:05,060
No one saw me.

3049
03:52:05,660 --> 03:52:06,740
So you're back with Vulgan?

3050
03:52:07,440 --> 03:52:08,620
In a matter of speaking.

3051
03:52:09,360 --> 03:52:10,220
What about the boss?

3052
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:12,100
Yeah, she's here too.

3053
03:52:12,620 --> 03:52:13,480
Better be careful.

3054
03:52:14,240 --> 03:52:14,920
Thanks, I will.

3055
03:52:15,520 --> 03:52:17,240
The boss and I get along pretty well, though.

3056
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:19,580
I guess we traders have a lot in common.

3057
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:20,200
The...

3058
03:52:20,200 --> 03:52:21,760
Why would anyone want to defect?

3059
03:52:21,780 --> 03:52:22,240
The claw.

3060
03:52:22,440 --> 03:52:23,780
Betraying your country like that.

3061
03:52:24,380 --> 03:52:25,280
I just don't get it.

3062
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:27,480
Are you talking about the boss?

3063
03:52:28,020 --> 03:52:29,200
Why'd you do it?

3064
03:52:29,580 --> 03:52:30,180
Were you born and raised in America?

3065
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:32,560
Wait, I wonder if there's a new codex for the...

3066
03:52:33,140 --> 03:52:33,620
Croc...

3067
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:34,540
Croc...

3068
03:52:34,540 --> 03:52:34,920
Outfit.

3069
03:52:34,920 --> 03:52:34,940
With Siggint.

3070
03:52:34,940 --> 03:52:38,840
I never even knew there were other countries, other cultures, other ways of thinking.

3071
03:52:39,640 --> 03:52:41,240
Until I went to work for the NSA.

3072
03:52:42,120 --> 03:52:46,600
Then one day, I'd found I'd lost faith in the things I'd been taking for granted.

3073
03:52:47,240 --> 03:52:48,340
What did you see?

3074
03:52:48,900 --> 03:52:51,080
What was it that made you want to change sides?

3075
03:52:51,940 --> 03:52:53,660
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

3076
03:52:54,320 --> 03:52:54,720
Try me.

3077
03:52:55,560 --> 03:52:56,820
I saw the universe.

3078
03:52:57,780 --> 03:52:58,440
The universe?

3079
03:52:58,900 --> 03:52:59,560
Look how pretty she is.

3080
03:52:59,560 --> 03:53:00,880
Not the actual universe.

3081
03:53:01,560 --> 03:53:04,540
The universe as the intelligence community sees it.

3082
03:53:05,240 --> 03:53:08,700
I realized that the gravity in this universe was holding me back.

3083
03:53:09,280 --> 03:53:09,720
That's all.

3084
03:53:09,940 --> 03:53:13,080
People and countries are both changed by their environment.

3085
03:53:13,100 --> 03:53:14,140
I love this picture of her.

3086
03:53:14,240 --> 03:53:15,020
And by the times.

3087
03:53:17,240 --> 03:53:17,540
saying.

3088
03:53:18,360 --> 03:53:25,820
There's a world of difference between this country and America, but it's only a difference of position, a difference of perspective.

3089
03:53:26,920 --> 03:53:28,700
Coming here made me realize something.

3090
03:53:29,440 --> 03:53:32,380
Half of what I'd been told was a complete and utter lie.

3091
03:53:32,980 --> 03:53:36,000
The other half was a conveniently constructed lie.

3092
03:53:36,580 --> 03:53:37,840
Where's the truth then?

3093
03:53:38,460 --> 03:53:40,200
It's hidden in the lies.

3094
03:53:40,920 --> 03:53:41,880
Hidden in the lies.

3095
03:53:42,240 --> 03:53:44,300
Real eyes tell real lies.

3096
03:53:44,300 --> 03:53:48,520
I've been trained to make even the most severe falsehood sound like the honest truth.

3097
03:53:49,020 --> 03:53:49,780
Weren't you?

3098
03:53:50,620 --> 03:53:54,100
No, I believe because I have to.

3099
03:53:54,780 --> 03:53:55,820
Even if it is a lie.

3100
03:53:56,800 --> 03:53:57,800
That's part of my mission.

3101
03:53:58,480 --> 03:53:59,520
I'll have to remember that.

3102
03:54:00,240 --> 03:54:01,960
If you need me, give me a call on the radio.

3103
03:54:02,640 --> 03:54:06,020
My frequency is 142.52.

3104
03:54:11,590 --> 03:54:12,070
Hello?

3105
03:54:12,790 --> 03:54:13,270
Hello?

3106
03:54:14,950 --> 03:54:15,430
Hello?

3107
03:54:16,030 --> 03:54:16,690
Are we back?

3108
03:54:16,730 --> 03:54:17,670
Are we back?

3109
03:54:17,810 --> 03:54:18,130
Are we back?

3110
03:54:18,270 --> 03:54:18,570
Are we back?

3111
03:54:18,710 --> 03:54:19,070
Are we back?

3112
03:54:19,190 --> 03:54:19,850
Are we back?

3113
03:54:20,050 --> 03:54:21,430
Are we back?

3114
03:54:21,550 --> 03:54:22,430
Back, back, back, back, back.

3115
03:54:22,790 --> 03:54:23,070
Hello!

3116
03:54:24,810 --> 03:54:25,290
Hi!

3117
03:54:26,450 --> 03:54:27,010
One moment.

3118
03:54:27,250 --> 03:54:28,490
Everything fell apart.

3119
03:54:28,650 --> 03:54:30,270
My mic came undone.

3120
03:54:31,750 --> 03:54:36,690
And everything in the world decided to shit on me all at once.

3121
03:54:37,730 --> 03:54:41,030
Okay, I'm just gonna have to deal with my mic being broken a little bit.

3122
03:54:43,250 --> 03:54:45,090
So OBS crashed.

3123
03:54:45,850 --> 03:54:46,710
And then...

3124
03:54:46,730 --> 03:54:50,290
And then my, and then the game crashed.

3125
03:54:50,890 --> 03:54:53,630
And then my monitor turned off.

3126
03:54:53,870 --> 03:54:58,110
I was doing like control alt delete because the game was still going.

3127
03:54:58,550 --> 03:55:00,530
I could hear it going with the rain.

3128
03:55:00,830 --> 03:55:09,230
And then, and then my monitor, but because my monitor crashed, I, I, I couldn't, I couldn't.

3129
03:55:09,330 --> 03:55:11,130
The control alt delete didn't work.

3130
03:55:11,970 --> 03:55:12,350
It was.

3131
03:55:17,570 --> 03:55:49,510
um let's but right now I'm kind of scared it's saying I hope it saved I hope it saved how did your mic break though well the mic stand broke and my mic started falling that's why actually and I've been trying to fix it the past couple days and It hasn't been cooperating with me.

3132
03:55:50,170 --> 03:55:51,450
It should have auto-saved.

3133
03:55:51,610 --> 03:55:51,830
Okay.

3134
03:55:52,430 --> 03:55:53,610
Let's try it.

3135
03:55:54,950 --> 03:55:56,790
Okay, starting the game back up.

3136
03:56:00,650 --> 03:56:01,450
Tee-hee.

3137
03:56:04,550 --> 03:56:05,990
Setup is in process.

3138
03:56:15,590 --> 03:56:16,390
Okay.

3139
03:56:19,290 --> 03:56:20,090
Huh?

3140
03:56:22,410 --> 03:56:23,210
Okay.

3141
03:56:23,650 --> 03:56:24,030
Okay.

3142
03:56:28,090 --> 03:56:28,610
Okay.

3143
03:56:37,640 --> 03:56:40,360
Nah, my computer is experiencing those problems.

3144
03:56:42,280 --> 03:56:44,080
Oh, we have the intro now.

3145
03:56:47,220 --> 03:56:50,220
Oh, sorry, we're going to skip it because I want to play Key Plague.

3146
03:56:53,060 --> 03:56:54,880
Okay, okay, let's get back in.

3147
03:57:01,670 --> 03:57:03,430
What extras do we have now?

3148
03:57:11,290 --> 03:57:14,510
We got our scientist.

3149
03:57:17,510 --> 03:57:17,870
Low?

3150
03:57:18,330 --> 03:57:19,630
Wait, maybe if I just continue.

3151
03:57:20,550 --> 03:57:21,050
It should be good.

3152
03:57:24,130 --> 03:57:25,290
Okay.

3153
03:57:27,070 --> 03:57:29,190
No FSR.

3154
03:57:32,990 --> 03:57:33,470
Oh.

3155
03:57:33,870 --> 03:57:36,450
I don't remember.

3156
03:57:42,870 --> 03:57:48,210
is on yeah I was like I'm pretty sure I had that set

3157
03:57:51,990 --> 03:57:55,950
though probably I could turn the resolution down

3158
03:58:00,990 --> 03:58:15,610
you know might be worth it hold on how what should I even turn it to though what would we go all the way to Let's see...

3159
03:58:17,430 --> 03:58:20,790
But the game was looking so good for me!

3160
03:58:30,300 --> 03:58:31,900
One moment.

3161
03:58:32,720 --> 03:58:33,080
Ah!

3162
03:58:34,400 --> 03:58:35,420
One moment.

3163
03:58:36,660 --> 03:58:39,020
Everything is fucked!

3164
03:58:39,200 --> 03:58:40,360
Everybody sucks!

3165
03:58:40,720 --> 03:58:42,420
Now I'm small!

3166
03:58:43,720 --> 03:58:43,840
Ah!

3167
03:58:47,570 --> 03:58:48,630
Okay.

3168
03:58:52,990 --> 03:59:02,830
big and then I need you guys okay you're over here why'd you do that?

3169
03:59:03,090 --> 03:59:04,090
Why'd you go over there?

3170
03:59:05,830 --> 03:59:06,330
alright.

3171
03:59:07,110 --> 03:59:08,730
Alright this might help actually.

3172
03:59:09,190 --> 03:59:10,550
I probably not might.

3173
03:59:10,690 --> 03:59:12,210
I think this will help a lot actually.

3174
03:59:12,870 --> 03:59:14,090
I didn't even think about it.

3175
03:59:14,130 --> 03:59:14,710
I'll be honest.

3176
03:59:14,870 --> 03:59:16,950
I completely forgot to change the resolution.

3177
03:59:23,250 --> 03:59:24,770
No it's ruining everything!

3178
03:59:25,130 --> 03:59:25,370
No!

3179
03:59:43,810 --> 03:59:44,690
I don't know what to do.

3180
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:07,010
Okay, I'm over it.

3181
04:00:08,710 --> 04:00:09,750
Let me...

3182
04:00:09,750 --> 04:00:10,250
Wait, no.

3183
04:00:10,730 --> 04:00:12,110
What did I just press?

3184
04:00:12,250 --> 04:00:13,670
Wait, get me back on the gameplays.

3185
04:00:15,850 --> 04:00:17,970
Sorry, everything goes by when...

3186
04:00:19,250 --> 04:00:19,770
Sorry.

3187
04:00:20,650 --> 04:00:20,850
Ah!

3188
04:00:33,800 --> 04:00:34,320
Okay.

3189
04:00:34,920 --> 04:00:35,440
All right.

3190
04:00:35,540 --> 04:00:37,640
Wow, you guys just keep getting bigger and bigger.

3191
04:00:40,260 --> 04:00:40,780
Okay.

3192
04:00:45,290 --> 04:00:45,810
Okay.

3193
04:00:46,490 --> 04:00:46,910
Alright.

3194
04:00:47,690 --> 04:00:48,150
Then?

3195
04:00:48,710 --> 04:00:49,670
I'm afraid to...

3196
04:00:49,670 --> 04:00:51,110
Wait, where am I?

3197
04:00:51,290 --> 04:00:52,590
Okay, there I am.

3198
04:00:52,930 --> 04:00:54,970
I'm afraid to click back into the game.

3199
04:00:56,270 --> 04:00:58,350
I'm afraid to click back into the game.

3200
04:00:58,950 --> 04:00:59,170
Wait.

3201
04:00:59,550 --> 04:00:59,890
Eh?

3202
04:01:00,430 --> 04:01:00,950
What?

3203
04:01:01,250 --> 04:01:01,430
Eh?

3204
04:01:02,550 --> 04:01:03,670
Oh, that's why.

3205
04:01:03,950 --> 04:01:04,070
Oh.

3206
04:01:06,110 --> 04:01:07,110
There we go.

3207
04:01:08,950 --> 04:01:10,710
I'm flickering like a ghost.

3208
04:01:13,250 --> 04:01:14,270
Okay, here we go.

3209
04:01:14,390 --> 04:01:15,830
I'm gonna click back into the game.

3210
04:01:17,490 --> 04:01:18,770
I'm gonna do it!

3211
04:01:18,810 --> 04:01:19,910
I'm going ghost!

3212
04:01:21,090 --> 04:01:23,070
Oh, everything was fine.

3213
04:01:24,470 --> 04:01:26,330
I'm still lagging bad though.

3214
04:01:32,250 --> 04:01:36,330
Okay, now, wait, what if I go back into full screen now?

3215
04:01:38,690 --> 04:01:41,450
Oh, it's back at 4K!

3216
04:01:41,630 --> 04:01:42,810
You're right, that's why!

3217
04:01:43,350 --> 04:01:43,710
Okay.

3218
04:01:44,510 --> 04:01:44,990
All right.

3219
04:01:46,810 --> 04:01:47,770
Here we go.

3220
04:01:47,950 --> 04:01:48,810
I'm gonna change it.

3221
04:01:49,890 --> 04:01:50,490
Oh,

3222
04:01:55,950 --> 04:01:56,770
I'm windowed.

3223
04:01:56,910 --> 04:01:58,090
Wait, I did the wrong thing.

3224
04:02:28,080 --> 04:02:29,640
I can't full screen it.

3225
04:02:30,180 --> 04:02:31,580
I just have to be windowed.

3226
04:02:32,440 --> 04:02:32,440
I

3227
04:02:35,920 --> 04:02:36,800
could...

3228
04:02:37,420 --> 04:02:39,200
It's the only way.

3229
04:02:40,640 --> 04:02:42,140
It's the only way.

3230
04:02:50,390 --> 04:02:51,710
By God, I also...

3231
04:02:51,710 --> 04:02:53,990
I was so unprepared for this.

3232
04:02:54,430 --> 04:02:56,690
Because I even forgot to turn off wallpaper engine.

3233
04:02:58,770 --> 04:03:02,610
I set everything up and I'm just like, okay, this is, this is it.

3234
04:03:03,210 --> 04:03:04,970
And I completely, I forgot to do everything.

3235
04:03:05,150 --> 04:03:07,550
So my computer, no wonder it was about to crash.

3236
04:03:09,870 --> 04:03:12,930
I'm still sleepy from coming home, sorry.

3237
04:03:13,710 --> 04:03:15,090
Ha ha, ha, okay.

3238
04:03:15,510 --> 04:03:19,990
Anyway, now we should be running out of everything fine.

3239
04:03:25,570 --> 04:03:54,470
For what it's worth besides you teleporting flickering a little we see no issues oh i see every everything is flashing at once wait now the screen is so small how am i supposed to see a snake like this but i'm not laggy yay okay we're back everybody we're back in business seizure test actually okay um

Wait, I think that thing is poisonous, no?

3243
04:04:33,030 --> 04:04:35,630
How can the leech get me through my big old crock suit?

3244
04:04:39,950 --> 04:04:41,030
What's over there?

3245
04:04:42,670 --> 04:04:43,650
We're gonna go see.

3246
04:04:45,230 --> 04:04:45,810
I'm diving.

3247
04:04:51,810 --> 04:04:52,630
Just kidding.

3248
04:04:52,890 --> 04:04:53,330
No use.

3249
04:04:54,750 --> 04:04:56,070
Watch out for the crock.

3250
04:04:58,090 --> 04:04:59,110
And why?

3251
04:05:00,690 --> 04:05:04,010
Actually, it's so much easier swimming in this game.

3252
04:05:04,450 --> 04:05:07,810
I feel like I'm not going every which way.

3253
04:05:08,590 --> 04:05:09,770
But Snake is pretty slow.

3254
04:05:09,930 --> 04:05:10,670
I'm not going to lie.

3255
04:05:12,430 --> 04:05:12,850
Come on, Snake.

3256
04:05:13,430 --> 04:05:14,390
Pick up them legs.

3257
04:05:15,330 --> 04:05:15,990
Come on, Snake.

3258
04:05:16,170 --> 04:05:16,430
Hold on.

3259
04:05:16,450 --> 04:05:18,070
I should actually drink the water I got.

3260
04:05:31,130 --> 04:05:31,970
It's a troop.

3261
04:05:32,670 --> 04:05:34,070
Snake, are you there?

3262
04:05:34,570 --> 04:05:34,810

Did you make it without any trouble?

3265
04:05:38,710 --> 04:05:39,550
No one saw me.

04:05:40,130 --> 04:05:41,270

04:06:15,350 --> 04:06:16,010
Wait, where am I?

3270
04:06:16,270 --> 04:06:18,310
Okay, here we go.

3271
04:06:21,990 --> 04:06:24,790
Oh, I just got kissed.

3272
04:06:27,530 --> 04:06:28,970
Let's stay away from me.

3273
04:06:32,450 --> 04:06:33,510
Soon we'll have to eat.

3274
04:06:38,070 --> 04:06:39,550
I will surface.

3275
04:06:40,890 --> 04:06:41,110
No!

3276
04:06:44,200 --> 04:06:45,420
Be do, be do.

3277
04:06:58,320 --> 04:07:00,080
Oh, I did it again.

3278
04:07:02,700 --> 04:07:03,220
Okay.

3279
04:07:05,760 --> 04:07:06,780
All right.

3280
04:07:09,740 --> 04:07:10,340
Come on, Snake.

3281
04:07:10,920 --> 04:07:11,900
Pick up them flippers.

3282
04:07:13,500 --> 04:07:14,320
Let's have our...

3283
04:07:14,320 --> 04:07:15,800
I'm actually starting to get hungry myself.

3284
04:07:16,660 --> 04:07:19,260
Let's have ourselves a Siberian in-camp.

3285
04:07:22,260 --> 04:07:23,700
Not so great.

3286
04:07:24,560 --> 04:07:27,020
The Yabuku-Burloko is also not good, right?

3287
04:07:27,120 --> 04:07:27,540
I remember.

3288
04:07:27,860 --> 04:07:28,720
He doesn't like it.

3289
04:07:28,720 --> 04:07:31,440
Ah, what is this?

3290
04:07:31,840 --> 04:07:34,160
What about this, the Otten Frog?

3291
04:07:35,900 --> 04:07:37,880
Ah, pretty tasty.

3292
04:07:38,340 --> 04:07:39,220
Pretty tasty.

3293
04:07:42,740 --> 04:07:46,340
I guess I should get the frog or the leeches too, huh?

3294
04:07:48,580 --> 04:07:51,480
Oh, we get a special!

3295
04:07:52,560 --> 04:07:52,980
Ew!

3296
04:07:56,320 --> 04:07:58,100
We didn't get this one last time.

3297
04:08:00,500 --> 04:08:03,820
It's straight on the

3298
04:08:07,110 --> 04:08:07,490
nip.

3299
04:08:10,990 --> 04:08:13,030
Full of blood.

3300
04:08:16,530 --> 04:08:16,550
Okay.

3301
04:08:17,990 --> 04:08:18,410
Oh, wait.

3302
04:08:18,610 --> 04:08:19,710
I've missed one.

3303
04:08:22,830 --> 04:08:23,310
Okay.

3304
04:08:29,430 --> 04:08:30,450
That's a crock.

3305
04:08:33,810 --> 04:08:37,150
You think he'll be able to climb easy with this big old suit on?

3306
04:08:38,530 --> 04:08:46,210
Alright, easy does it, easy does it, easy does it, easy does it.

3307
04:08:54,970 --> 04:08:56,210
Oh gosh.

3308
04:09:07,400 --> 04:09:08,540
Oh, oops.

3309
04:09:11,360 --> 04:09:16,060
I have to very awkwardly and very slowly walk back.

3310
04:09:25,750 --> 04:09:27,710
I don't know what the button would be, though.

3311
04:09:28,830 --> 04:09:30,550
I can't tell if it's A or Y.

3312
04:09:34,770 --> 04:09:35,810
I'm going to get these fish.

3313
04:09:37,990 --> 04:09:39,590
I'm going to kill them for food.

3314
04:09:42,790 --> 04:09:43,810
Oh, come on.

3315
04:09:46,490 --> 04:09:48,230
Let me kill the fish.

3316
04:09:53,640 --> 04:09:54,800
You think it's A?

3317
04:09:55,480 --> 04:09:56,500
Same button to hang.

3318
04:09:56,620 --> 04:09:57,160
Okay, okay.

3319
04:09:57,900 --> 04:09:59,660
It was so fast.

3320
04:10:00,240 --> 04:10:02,090
Oh, let's get rid of this guy real quick.

3321
04:10:13,140 --> 04:10:13,760
Okay.

3322
04:10:14,660 --> 04:10:15,380
A to hang.

3323
04:10:16,480 --> 04:10:17,260
Hang loose.

3324
04:10:17,940 --> 04:10:18,440
We're hanging.

3325
04:10:19,180 --> 04:10:20,480
We're hanging in there.

3326
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:25,020
Okay.

3327
04:10:25,840 --> 04:10:26,520
All right.

3328
04:10:27,420 --> 04:10:28,680
We need to let go.

3329
04:10:32,180 --> 04:10:32,740
Wait.

3330
04:10:36,390 --> 04:10:36,670
We?

3331
04:10:37,330 --> 04:10:38,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

3332
04:10:38,450 --> 04:10:38,590
Ah!

3333
04:10:50,170 --> 04:10:51,290
Oh, come on.

3334
04:11:00,160 --> 04:11:02,560
At least the gator didn't give me.

3335
04:11:05,360 --> 04:11:07,920
Brother, why do you keep bothering us?

3336
04:11:10,840 --> 04:11:12,020
Oh, come on.

3337
04:11:14,860 --> 04:11:16,240
Why is this so difficult?

3338
04:11:16,620 --> 04:11:18,740
Wait, I just realized I have the Crock-Hat.

3339
04:11:18,900 --> 04:11:19,300
I forgot.

3340
04:11:20,440 --> 04:11:21,540
But I want the original.

3341
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:24,000
I feel like we need to get this one too, you know?

3342
04:11:27,830 --> 04:11:28,250
Brother.

3343
04:11:29,410 --> 04:11:30,590
Brother, what are you doing?

3344
04:11:31,950 --> 04:11:34,210
I was pressing A, A, like crazy.

3345
04:11:34,810 --> 04:11:35,530
So I don't know.

3346
04:11:36,550 --> 04:11:37,350
Might not be me.

3347
04:11:38,130 --> 04:11:39,550
Might be the fault of the game.

3348
04:11:41,330 --> 04:11:42,270
Could never be me.

3349
04:11:47,050 --> 04:11:48,170
Could never be me.

3350
04:11:49,910 --> 04:11:51,800
Uh oh, I'm kind of hungry.

3351
04:12:06,940 --> 04:12:08,400
We did it.

3352
04:12:08,960 --> 04:12:09,760
We did it, Reddit.

3353
04:12:11,860 --> 04:12:12,700
Will I make it?

3354
04:12:13,280 --> 04:12:14,020
Please say yes.

3355
04:12:15,980 --> 04:12:17,060
Please say yes.

3356
04:12:23,770 --> 04:12:27,570
And just because my depth perception is really bad.

3357
04:12:29,670 --> 04:12:30,790
Croc cap.

3358
04:12:31,670 --> 04:12:33,570
The original, baby!

3359
04:12:34,890 --> 04:12:35,570
The original.

3360
04:12:51,700 --> 04:12:53,200
This might help, actually.

3361
04:12:54,340 --> 04:12:54,660
Oh, wait.

3362
04:12:54,760 --> 04:12:55,640
Under item, probably.

3363
04:12:58,900 --> 04:13:02,320
This might help us with getting through this next part.

3364
04:13:02,680 --> 04:13:02,950
Let's see.

3365
04:13:08,010 --> 04:13:08,630
Ye-ho!

3366
04:13:11,310 --> 04:13:13,770
Wait, I think we have both in my inventory, too.

3367
04:13:15,150 --> 04:13:15,290
Nope.

3368
04:13:15,710 --> 04:13:16,130
Just the one.

3369
04:13:16,310 --> 04:13:16,450
Okay.

3370
04:13:18,170 --> 04:13:19,510
Let's chow down.

3371
04:13:19,530 --> 04:13:23,150
on something.

3372
04:13:23,630 --> 04:13:24,930
A reticulated python.

3373
04:13:27,130 --> 04:13:28,450
Oh, we get the viewer.

3374
04:13:42,280 --> 04:13:44,740
Are you eating it or just spitting it out?

3375
04:13:55,560 --> 04:13:57,020
I want some more.

3376
04:13:57,700 --> 04:14:00,700
I want some more.

3377
04:14:01,520 --> 04:14:02,820
Let's see how so...

3378
04:14:02,820 --> 04:14:03,120
Oh, wait.

3379
04:14:03,320 --> 04:14:03,620
Wrong thing.

3380
04:14:05,320 --> 04:14:05,660
Zero.

3381
04:14:05,760 --> 04:14:06,140
Look at me.

3382
04:14:06,620 --> 04:14:40,040
it looks like you've got rid of all the ocelots yeah now proceed with the rescue of sokolov according to eva you should start by going to the crevice to the north can we trust her what's that eva's with the kgb isn't she can i really believe how many snacks how do i know she won't actually have to make food for me there are no guarantees in espionage snake only calculated guesses at this point in time the kgb stands nothing to gain by stabbing us in the back I'm saying the chance that she'll betray you is low.

3383
04:14:41,820 --> 04:14:44,900
Of course, we checked the route she gave you against our own data.

3384
04:14:45,760 --> 04:14:47,720
It looks like a pretty solid infiltration route.

3385
04:14:48,220 --> 04:14:50,660
It makes good use of weak spots in the enemy's defenses.

3386
04:14:50,960 --> 04:14:52,040
You shouldn't have any problems.

3387
04:14:52,700 --> 04:14:55,100
Follow the route Eva showed you and proceed with the mission.

3388
04:14:55,500 --> 04:14:55,860
Roger.

3389
04:14:56,440 --> 04:14:58,220
First, enter the cave through the crevice.

3390
04:14:58,880 --> 04:14:59,960
Eva said it was to the north.

3391
04:15:00,340 --> 04:15:01,180
So head that way.

3392
04:15:07,610 --> 04:15:09,290
You got some instant noodles, huh?

3393
04:15:09,870 --> 04:15:10,750
Instant noodles.

3394
04:15:11,310 --> 04:15:12,050
Uh-huh.

3395
04:15:12,370 --> 04:15:14,110
It was invented in Japan just recently.

3396
04:15:14,930 --> 04:15:16,530
Add some hot water and it's ready to eat.

3397
04:15:17,530 --> 04:15:19,470
It's cheap and can be stored for a long time.

3398
04:15:19,910 --> 04:15:21,270
And besides, it's delicious.

3399
04:15:21,790 --> 04:15:23,130
It's like a miracle food.

3400
04:15:23,470 --> 04:15:23,790
Wow.

3401
04:15:24,270 --> 04:15:25,110
It's yummy.

3402
04:15:25,810 --> 04:15:25,810
Which?

3403
04:15:26,430 --> 04:15:27,390
I want some ramen.

3404
04:15:27,570 --> 04:15:28,470
Are you going to eat that?

3405
04:15:28,970 --> 04:15:30,730
I was planning on it, yeah.

3406
04:15:31,150 --> 04:15:32,410
No, all right.

3407
04:15:32,770 --> 04:15:34,530
Is there some reason I shouldn't?

3408
04:15:35,130 --> 04:15:36,630
No, that's not what I meant.

3409
04:15:37,170 --> 04:15:38,250
Then what did you mean?

3410
04:15:38,810 --> 04:15:45,970
I was just going to say that if you going to eat it you should bring it back to me i've always wanted to try some whatever

3411
04:15:53,030 --> 04:16:11,130
let's see i think sigan's gonna tell us all about other weapons though i think hey snake remember back at the abandoned factory we have a couple codex to get through before we get the the croc i've never heard of a customization like that before why the grip to fit it with a knife A knife?

3412
04:16:11,150 --> 04:16:13,410
You gonna keep the knife and the gun both at the ready?

3413
04:16:13,990 --> 04:16:14,750
What do you have?

3414
04:16:15,230 --> 04:16:15,770
A knife.

3415
04:16:16,070 --> 04:16:16,850
Why would you wanna do that?

3416
04:16:17,590 --> 04:16:20,950
Sometimes a knife works better in close proximity encounters.

3417
04:16:21,830 --> 04:16:22,590
So I equip both at the same time.

3418
04:16:22,590 --> 04:16:24,510
Okay, I might go heat up my food while I'm sorry.

3419
04:16:24,870 --> 04:16:25,930
I keep taking breaks.

3420
04:16:27,070 --> 04:16:27,530
Badass.

3421
04:16:28,050 --> 04:16:28,710
So there's that.

3422
04:16:29,850 --> 04:16:30,310
CQC.

3423
04:16:30,610 --> 04:16:31,070
CQC.

3424
04:16:31,810 --> 04:16:32,430
Okay, hold on.

3425
04:16:32,790 --> 04:16:34,190
So I'm gonna put on zero.

3426
04:16:35,450 --> 04:16:37,050
And then, unless it's about the crocsuit.

3427
04:16:37,410 --> 04:16:38,830
That swamp seems pretty deep.

3428
04:16:38,970 --> 04:17:34,570
It's probably deep enough to dive under and swim around press the crouch button when you're swimming on the surface to dive underwater the controls when you're underwater differ somewhat from when you're on land the movement stick controls the direction you will get hungry simply move the movement stick to move in that direction simply move the movement press the action button repeatedly to swim faster this is useful when you're in a hurry you can also press the evade button to surface in an emergency if you want to change the direction you're facing because i was using my mouse that's crazy okay zero look at my crocsuit snake you'll be helpless if a crocodile attacks you in the water they won't you can't see behind you when you're swimming actually i don't think they do because i'm in that crocsuit keep an eye on your six also by using your sensors you should be able to detect crocodiles before they get too close look at it look at it major zero

3429
04:17:37,750 --> 04:17:38,970
How does it look?

3430
04:17:39,270 --> 04:17:40,310
It looks cool.

3431
04:17:40,770 --> 04:17:41,030
Yeah.

3432
04:17:41,930 --> 04:17:43,250
It looks cool on you.

3433
04:17:43,490 --> 04:17:44,350
It does.

3434
04:17:44,770 --> 04:17:45,290
Yeah.

3435
04:17:46,310 --> 04:17:49,210
I don't think cool is the right word.

3436
04:17:49,430 --> 04:17:49,790
It does.

3437
04:17:50,150 --> 04:17:50,270
Why?

3438
04:17:50,510 --> 04:17:51,670
What's wrong with it?

3439
04:17:52,050 --> 04:17:52,410
What's wrong?

3440
04:17:52,750 --> 04:17:54,250
Don't you think it looks silly?

3441
04:17:54,710 --> 04:17:55,530
Doesn't it make you laugh?

3442
04:17:55,650 --> 04:17:57,530
Aren't you going to ask me what the hell I was thinking?

3443
04:17:58,250 --> 04:17:58,690
No.

3444
04:17:59,450 --> 04:17:59,830
Oh.

3445
04:18:00,150 --> 04:18:02,130
I think it really does look good.

3446
04:18:02,730 --> 04:18:04,330
It reminds me of the alligator people.

3447
04:18:05,210 --> 04:18:06,190
Oh, the... what?

3448
04:18:07,270 --> 04:18:37,630
alligator people he's like yeah you've never heard of it no oh well you should see it sometime it's about this guy who gets hurt in a car accident and tries to heal his wounds by injecting himself with a crocodile serum but then his head turns into a crocodile head you look just like sounds like me that's awesome right oh never mind i suppose you might be able to disguise yourself as a crocodile by wearing that cap and sticking your head out of the water Yeah!

3449
04:18:40,470 --> 04:18:41,650
Sigint, look at my hat.

3450
04:18:41,670 --> 04:18:46,790
Sounds like the Cobra Unit's members' names came from the specific emotions they each carry into battle.

3451
04:18:47,250 --> 04:18:47,650
Emotions?

3452
04:18:47,730 --> 04:18:49,090
Lord of Man, lore.

3453
04:18:49,870 --> 04:18:52,250
For unbearable torment, the pain.

3454
04:18:53,170 --> 04:18:53,430
The pain.

3455
04:18:53,450 --> 04:18:55,610
For true oblivion, the end.

3456
04:18:56,890 --> 04:18:59,090
For infinite rage, the fury.

3457
04:19:00,430 --> 04:19:02,250
For absolute terror, the fear.

3458
04:19:03,650 --> 04:19:06,370
And for unsurpassed bliss, the joy.

3459
04:19:06,370 --> 04:19:23,330
the joy it's another name for the boss because of the joy she feels in battle I suppose during the war she had a partner named the sorrow sorrow and joy they say there couldn't have been a more perfect pair

3460
04:19:26,450 --> 04:19:39,570
man wait but second look at my hat snake you said Eva said her mouser was a type 17 right yeah what about it that model was produced in the 1920s and a weapons lab in the Shang-Zhi province in China.

3461
04:19:40,050 --> 04:19:44,370
The cartridge part sticks out lower than the original to accommodate 45 caliber rounds.

3462
04:19:44,990 --> 04:19:47,110
The barrel and chamber are a little bit thicker too.

3463
04:19:47,990 --> 04:19:52,830
But most telling of all, it's got Chinese characters engraved on both sides of the frame like you saw.

3464
04:19:53,950 --> 04:19:57,110
And that firing stance, Eva, was talking about when you hold the gun horizontally.

3465
04:19:57,650 --> 04:19:59,170
That's a trademark of the Chinese.

3466
04:19:59,810 --> 04:20:01,110
Way, way, way.

3467
04:20:01,410 --> 04:20:06,170
When you're firing in full auto mode, the muzzle jump effect gives you a horizontal strafing motion.

3468
04:20:06,930 --> 04:21:09,210
they say it's especially deadly in indoor and close-range mop-up actions the Japanese called it bandit shooting and used to dread it and it makes you wonder where she learned to shoot like that I love a woman that knows how to shoot you know that army motorcycle that Eva was riding that's a replica of a German yeah after World War two the Soviets confiscated an entire assembly line from a German motorcycle factory machines and all and then they took it back with them and started producing replicas exactly originally that motorcycle was designed to be used with the sidecar attached that means it's got enough power to drag a 200 plus pound sidecar around so that's how she could pull off all those crazy stunts I was trying to move the window so I could see how long I've been streaming now the OBS is reset let's see one more the Davy Crockett's that the boss took with her when she defected are mortars that fire nuclear warheads.

3469
04:21:10,130 --> 04:21:14,850
They're named after Davy Crockett, the hero who died defending the Alamo in the Texan War of Independence.

3470
04:21:15,710 --> 04:21:16,650
Remember the Alamo.

3471
04:21:17,550 --> 04:21:17,830
That's right.

3472
04:21:18,150 --> 04:21:18,870
Remember the Alamo.

3473
04:21:18,890 --> 04:21:22,590
The warheads are equivalent to between 10 and 20 tons of TNT.

3474
04:21:23,150 --> 04:21:27,490
Every building within 150 yards of the Hypo Center is completely obliterated.

3475
04:21:28,590 --> 04:21:32,270
But the warheads the boss had with her were some kind of experimental super bomb.

3476
04:21:32,330 --> 04:21:32,850
That's crazy.

3477
04:21:32,870 --> 04:21:34,790
So they're actually even more powerful than that.

3478
04:21:35,470 --> 04:21:41,790
I don't even want to think about what happened if she used it again Snake, you know what you have to do.

3479
04:21:42,190 --> 04:21:43,810
Yeah, I know

3480
04:21:49,710 --> 04:21:51,970
Makes me so sad

3481
04:21:57,270 --> 04:22:02,550
Makes me so sad Oh, come on.

3482
04:22:02,610 --> 04:22:11,590
I was in the water for two seconds You stinking leech at least these guys Don't take...

3483
04:22:11,590 --> 04:22:12,590
Wait a second.

3484
04:22:13,210 --> 04:22:13,390
Wait.

3485
04:22:16,030 --> 04:22:17,950
Oh, I thought I had something on my feet.

3486
04:22:19,230 --> 04:22:21,630
Um, they don't take supplies or anything.

3487
04:22:25,030 --> 04:22:26,530
Crawling like I'm a crocodile.

3488
04:22:27,030 --> 04:22:27,870
I'm a crocodile.

3489
04:22:30,590 --> 04:22:32,090
Hope NGS Con was fun for you.

3490
04:22:32,850 --> 04:22:34,210
It was!

3491
04:22:37,970 --> 04:22:45,950
I love hearing the the what's it called of the of the suit you hear it

3492
04:22:49,810 --> 04:23:03,290
I think they'll be afraid of me if I'm a crocodile oh you see that you see that right there okay oh there's one over there wait can I crawl up to it and grab it

3493
04:23:08,010 --> 04:23:09,250
Can I grab that?

3494
04:23:14,680 --> 04:23:15,220
Go eat.

3495
04:23:15,340 --> 04:23:21,340
I realize the food that I have is, like, kind of messy at my computer desk, so...

3496
04:23:21,340 --> 04:23:23,300
I don't think I could grab it.

3497
04:23:23,600 --> 04:23:24,800
I don't think I could grab it.

3498
04:23:27,600 --> 04:23:29,180
Or can I...

3499
04:23:29,180 --> 04:23:29,940
Go...

3500
04:23:35,830 --> 04:23:36,910
You can?

3501
04:23:38,670 --> 04:23:40,270
It didn't prompt me.

3502
04:23:40,610 --> 04:23:41,670
Unless there's no prompt.

3503
04:23:43,910 --> 04:23:44,610
Alright, Snake.

3504
04:23:44,870 --> 04:23:45,270
Turn around.

3505
04:23:45,990 --> 04:23:46,610
Let's try this guy.

3506
04:23:54,810 --> 04:23:54,970
Oh.

3507
04:23:56,150 --> 04:23:57,890
I didn't know if they updated it.

3508
04:23:58,030 --> 04:23:58,770
Okay, never mind.

3509
04:23:58,910 --> 04:23:59,390
We're fine.

3510
04:24:01,810 --> 04:24:02,250
Everything's good.

3511
04:24:02,970 --> 04:24:05,730
So I'm just gonna be a crocodile this entire time, I think.

3512
04:24:08,550 --> 04:24:11,210
I think it would make this part a whole lot easier.

3513
04:24:11,510 --> 04:24:12,450
I don't like this area.

3514
04:24:22,570 --> 04:24:22,970
Snake!

3515
04:24:23,750 --> 04:24:24,290
Snake!

3516
04:24:27,210 --> 04:24:28,790
Snake, what were you doing?

3517
04:24:29,090 --> 04:24:29,870
What were you thinking?

3518
04:24:31,450 --> 04:24:31,950
Okay.

3519
04:24:36,130 --> 04:24:37,770
The dog hasn't even noticed me.

3520
04:24:37,970 --> 04:24:39,010
Is it because I'm a alligator?

3521
04:24:41,390 --> 04:24:43,070
Oh my god.

3522
04:24:47,770 --> 04:24:49,130
I'm gonna be a crock.

3523
04:24:53,610 --> 04:24:54,610
How did he hear that?

3524
04:24:54,690 --> 04:24:55,710
Did the suppressor not work?

3525
04:24:57,590 --> 04:24:59,170
Or maybe because of the dog yield.

3526
04:25:00,810 --> 04:25:01,890
He's just asleep.

3527
04:25:05,150 --> 04:25:06,490
I'm gonna crack it down.

3528
04:25:06,930 --> 04:25:07,130
Wait.

3529
04:25:07,850 --> 04:25:09,310
I think I need to go the other way, huh?

3530
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:10,550
Wait, can I go through here?

3531
04:25:14,990 --> 04:25:15,390
No.

3532
04:25:19,500 --> 04:25:21,780
The dogs wake up faster, too, though.

3533
04:25:24,080 --> 04:25:25,000
Wait, I can't?

3534
04:25:25,200 --> 04:25:26,420
I gotta roll through it.

3535
04:25:26,840 --> 04:25:28,260
Oh, like, on the tree branch?

3536
04:25:29,000 --> 04:25:29,760
Was it that one?

3537
04:25:30,880 --> 04:25:34,000
I know there was one that you have to take the tree branch through it.

3538
04:25:35,220 --> 04:25:35,660
Um.

3539
04:25:38,480 --> 04:25:40,800
I'm like being so silly.

3540
04:25:46,180 --> 04:25:47,820
No, I don't think this is a tree branch one.

3541
04:25:48,820 --> 04:25:49,480
There's a hole.

3542
04:25:50,960 --> 04:25:52,480
Where do you guys see that?

3543
04:25:54,340 --> 04:25:55,140
I think.

3544
04:25:55,240 --> 04:25:56,440
Oh, right there!

3545
04:25:56,560 --> 04:25:56,800
Okay.

3546
04:25:57,480 --> 04:25:58,740
I wonder if I can get this guy.

3547
04:25:58,880 --> 04:25:59,360
Let's try.

3548
04:25:59,660 --> 04:25:59,900
Okay.

3549
04:26:00,120 --> 04:26:02,360
The drop off, it's kind of crazy.

3550
04:26:02,720 --> 04:26:04,000
So, three, two, one.

3551
04:26:09,530 --> 04:26:13,170
I want him to go to sleep before I try.

3552
04:26:15,650 --> 04:26:17,030
There's nothing here.

3553
04:26:20,370 --> 04:26:21,090
There's nothing here.

3554
04:26:22,050 --> 04:26:22,470
Okay, nerd.

3555
04:26:22,590 --> 04:26:23,790
Wow, this is a great shot.

3556
04:26:31,540 --> 04:26:31,780
Oh!

3557
04:26:32,980 --> 04:26:34,000
Oh my god!

3558
04:26:41,730 --> 04:26:42,910
Oh, there's two guys.

3559
04:26:47,180 --> 04:26:47,660
Uh...

3560
04:26:48,620 --> 04:26:50,020
Am I hitting the fence?

3561
04:26:50,180 --> 04:26:50,340
Oh!

3562
04:26:51,700 --> 04:26:52,160
Oh, nope.

3563
04:26:52,400 --> 04:26:53,680
I'm definitely hitting him.

3564
04:26:59,530 --> 04:27:01,470
And we're down.

3565
04:27:09,880 --> 04:27:12,260
Where'd that other guy go?

3566
04:27:16,500 --> 04:27:18,700
I'm not trying for a no-kill run.

3567
04:27:19,360 --> 04:27:23,260
It's just happening um...

3568
04:27:23,260 --> 04:27:26,500
Without me trying, I suppose you would say.

3569
04:27:27,060 --> 04:27:27,680
Where'd that guy go?

3570
04:27:29,080 --> 04:27:30,540
Where am I?

3571
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:34,280
Thanks for the tutorial on the map.

3572
04:27:43,930 --> 04:27:45,630
He's wearing a crock suit too.

3573
04:27:46,230 --> 04:27:49,770
He said, let me slip into something more comfortable.

3574
04:27:51,910 --> 04:27:54,010
I kind of want to see the reaction though.

3575
04:27:54,910 --> 04:27:56,210
But we did so well in this area.

3576
04:27:56,290 --> 04:27:57,190
Let's just go to the next part.

3577
04:27:58,390 --> 04:27:59,710
We can see people's reactions.

3578
04:28:00,650 --> 04:28:01,670
Look at him go.

3579
04:28:03,030 --> 04:28:04,890
All crack run.

3580
04:28:07,190 --> 04:28:11,870
Oh, let's not stand up because we're a crocodile and they don't do that.

3581
04:28:12,510 --> 04:28:13,570
Oh, it's this area.

3582
04:28:13,770 --> 04:28:14,790
I forgot about this area.

3583
04:28:15,850 --> 04:28:16,150
Okay, hold on.

3584
04:28:16,190 --> 04:28:18,070
I want to see them react to the croc.

3585
04:28:18,290 --> 04:28:18,450
Hold on.

3586
04:28:18,510 --> 04:28:19,950
I'm going to say...

3587
04:28:21,590 --> 04:28:22,070
Save.

3588
04:28:24,390 --> 04:28:25,990
Do you want to save?

3589
04:28:26,330 --> 04:28:26,710
Yes.

3590
04:28:29,950 --> 04:28:30,790
Hey, Snake.

3591
04:28:32,250 --> 04:28:33,750
Maybe I should go here at my foot now.

3592
04:28:34,270 --> 04:28:34,350
Nah.

3593
04:28:35,290 --> 04:28:40,070
It's about this expedition that goes to the planet Altair IV in an ultra-fast spaceship.

3594
04:28:40,770 --> 04:28:42,470
When they arrive, they meet the survivor of the last expedition.

3595
04:28:42,470 --> 04:28:45,370
But I want to see what his reaction is to my full crocodile outfit.

3596
04:28:45,710 --> 04:28:50,750
Dr. Morbius was exploring the planet along with his daughter Altaira and the versatile Robbie the Robot.

3597
04:28:51,030 --> 04:28:51,730
Robbie the Robot.

3598
04:28:51,930 --> 04:28:57,630
Ignoring the doctor's warnings, the expedition team is suddenly attacked by an invisible creature called the monster from the id.

3599
04:28:58,450 --> 04:29:01,410
The special effects they use for the science stuff were really neat.

3600
04:29:01,950 --> 04:29:05,190
I wish I had a robot like Robbie that could make anything I wanted it to.

3601
04:29:05,970 --> 04:29:08,090
I'm more interested in that invisible monster.

3602
04:29:08,790 --> 04:29:12,810
If I were invisible, I wouldn't have to bother hiding or wearing camouflage.

3603
04:29:13,750 --> 04:29:15,370
Maybe someday you'll be able to turn invisible.

3604
04:29:16,490 --> 04:29:16,850
Invisible.

3605
04:29:16,850 --> 04:29:18,130
Yeah, that'll be the day.

3606
04:29:20,470 --> 04:29:20,870
Invisible.

3607
04:29:22,570 --> 04:29:22,790
Wow.

3608
04:29:23,470 --> 04:29:27,250
Did I think they're just, are they just gonna think that a crocodile is walking in on their base?

3609
04:29:27,530 --> 04:29:28,670
That'd be so funny.

3610
04:29:30,110 --> 04:29:30,410
Hold on.

3611
04:29:30,470 --> 04:29:30,930
Come here.

3612
04:29:32,350 --> 04:29:33,930
Please come here.

3613
04:29:35,050 --> 04:29:37,150
I think I saw something.

3614
04:29:39,430 --> 04:29:40,930
You might have heard my tummy.

3615
04:29:42,370 --> 04:29:43,210
You see a crocodile?

3616
04:29:43,950 --> 04:29:44,010
Wait.

3617
04:29:44,610 --> 04:29:46,470
I want him to come look at me.

3618
04:29:46,930 --> 04:29:47,770
I'm a crocodile.

3619
04:29:51,310 --> 04:29:51,610
Hey.

3620
04:29:52,490 --> 04:29:53,610
Hey, come check me out.

3621
04:29:56,310 --> 04:29:57,190
Come check me out.

3622
04:29:58,650 --> 04:29:59,210
Who's that?

3623
04:29:59,230 --> 04:29:59,730
What?

3624
04:30:00,150 --> 04:30:00,470
No!

3625
04:30:00,930 --> 04:30:02,390
No way you could do!

3626
04:30:08,920 --> 04:30:10,280
Please respond.

3627
04:30:12,100 --> 04:30:13,560
Oh my god.

3628
04:30:21,670 --> 04:30:23,730
I thought they would be so scared of me.

3629
04:30:28,110 --> 04:30:29,470
Screw this.

3630
04:30:33,490 --> 04:30:34,890
It's time to change.

3631
04:30:37,170 --> 04:30:38,030
Didn't do that.

3632
04:30:40,130 --> 04:30:43,790
You know, I just realized I haven't had, like, rashes equipped or anything.

3633
04:31:05,150 --> 04:31:06,290
Oh, I'm gonna die for real.

3634
04:31:06,630 --> 04:31:08,570
I think I think I'm gonna die.

3635
04:31:09,870 --> 04:31:10,210
Ow!

3636
04:31:10,750 --> 04:31:11,750
I think I'm gonna die.

3637
04:31:12,210 --> 04:31:12,850
Get me out of here.

3638
04:31:14,330 --> 04:31:15,330
If I die, it's okay.

3639
04:31:16,050 --> 04:31:16,290
Ow!

3640
04:31:19,630 --> 04:31:21,390
Um, can you- Oh, I don't have CQC.

3641
04:31:21,510 --> 04:31:22,330
That's why- Oh, my bad.

3642
04:31:22,470 --> 04:31:23,270
I didn't mean to press that.

3643
04:31:24,150 --> 04:31:26,510
But, well, uh, I kind of want to start over.

3644
04:31:26,630 --> 04:31:28,530
I just wanted to experiment with the crack.

3645
04:31:30,530 --> 04:31:32,150
Now I'm more sad.

3646
04:31:33,510 --> 04:31:33,790
Ow!

3647
04:31:35,250 --> 04:31:36,990
Hold on, I'm too sad.

3648
04:31:37,230 --> 04:31:39,190
I don't care about you attacking me.

3649
04:31:39,750 --> 04:31:41,390
My crock suit failed me.

3650
04:31:42,750 --> 04:31:43,870
I'm too sad.

3651
04:31:53,230 --> 04:31:53,910
Crocodile.

3652
04:31:54,170 --> 04:31:55,970
They didn't even do that.

3653
04:31:57,390 --> 04:31:58,710
I'm so sad.

3654
04:32:00,150 --> 04:32:01,250
No, what's the point?

3655
04:32:04,090 --> 04:32:05,970
What's the stinking point?

3656
04:32:05,990 --> 04:32:09,910
Why are all of these worse than the croc suit?

3657
04:32:10,810 --> 04:32:10,950
Wait.

3658
04:32:13,090 --> 04:32:13,310
Oops.

3659
04:32:17,510 --> 04:32:19,350
Are these really all worse than the croc suit?

3660
04:32:20,550 --> 04:32:21,070
Dangy.

3661
04:32:23,010 --> 04:32:24,550
There was a guy who came out.

3662
04:32:24,610 --> 04:32:25,610
Oh, I see him now.

3663
04:32:27,870 --> 04:32:29,110
I wonder if I can get him.

3664
04:32:34,410 --> 04:32:35,030
Good enough.

3665
04:32:36,170 --> 04:32:36,810
Still hit.

3666
04:32:37,310 --> 04:32:37,910
Still hit.

3667
04:32:40,230 --> 04:32:41,490
Just my imagination.

3668
04:32:41,650 --> 04:32:43,110
Okay, I can't see you because of the croc.

3669
04:32:47,550 --> 04:32:49,990
The croc stays on.

3670
04:32:51,010 --> 04:32:51,550
Absolutely.

3671
04:32:53,390 --> 04:32:54,030
Absolutely.

3672
04:32:55,010 --> 04:32:55,210
Oops.

3673
04:32:57,950 --> 04:32:58,330
Ah!

3674
04:33:02,570 --> 04:33:03,690
What am I...

3675
04:33:03,690 --> 04:33:04,430
How am I missing?

3676
04:33:14,240 --> 04:33:14,700
Okay!

3677
04:33:15,720 --> 04:33:17,820
Really sounded like me right now, Snake.

3678
04:33:18,980 --> 04:33:19,460
Eat.

3679
04:33:21,680 --> 04:33:23,060
Hey, this worked.

04:33:23,080 --> 04:33:45,260

Let's blow up some stuff.

3685
04:34:45,460 --> 04:34:46,340
Let's blow up.

3686
04:34:56,750 --> 04:34:58,270
Let's blow up.

3687
04:35:01,290 --> 04:35:02,690
Severe burns.

3688
04:35:03,250 --> 04:35:04,630
I'll commit war crimes.

3689
04:35:06,430 --> 04:35:08,290
Wait, let's put all of the grenades.

3690
04:35:11,110 --> 04:35:13,650
Because I can have unlimited.

3691
04:35:16,610 --> 04:35:19,150
Yeah, I won't forget the other stuff too.

3692
04:35:20,610 --> 04:35:21,010
Okay, let's see.

3693
04:35:21,130 --> 04:35:21,850
How does this work?

3694
04:35:22,410 --> 04:35:22,590
Ready?

3695
04:35:22,710 --> 04:35:23,690
L-T-R-T, okay.

3696
04:35:26,670 --> 04:35:28,290
Crawl over to which...

3697
04:35:29,350 --> 04:35:29,870
Wait.

3698
04:35:30,210 --> 04:35:31,210
Claymores are...

3699
04:35:31,210 --> 04:35:31,850
I'm stupid.

3700
04:35:32,230 --> 04:35:32,730
That's not...

3701
04:35:32,730 --> 04:35:34,010
We'll do the grenades.

3702
04:35:35,450 --> 04:35:35,850
I don't know.

3703
04:35:36,290 --> 04:35:36,810
Claymores...

3704
04:35:36,810 --> 04:35:38,350
I was thinking of C4.

3705
04:35:38,650 --> 04:35:39,170
Okay.

3706
04:35:39,310 --> 04:35:40,510
Um.

3707
04:35:44,470 --> 04:35:45,230
You.

3708
04:35:48,860 --> 04:35:51,380
Where does that, where do I, should I blow it up?

3709
04:35:55,120 --> 04:35:57,020
Did that work?

3710
04:35:58,320 --> 04:35:58,700
HQ.

3711
04:36:00,200 --> 04:36:00,900
This is HQ.

3712
04:36:02,240 --> 04:36:02,820
Patrol here.

3713
04:36:03,760 --> 04:36:04,940
We're under fire.

3714
04:36:05,240 --> 04:36:06,280
Enemy position unknown.

3715
04:36:06,660 --> 04:36:07,700
Commencing alert status.

3716
04:36:08,660 --> 04:36:09,360
Acknowledged.

3717
04:36:09,620 --> 04:36:10,620
Sending reinforcements.

3718
04:36:10,620 --> 04:36:11,900
Use extra caution.

3719
04:36:12,080 --> 04:36:13,140
What did you...

3720
04:36:13,140 --> 04:36:15,260
Wait, what did I just pick up?

3721
04:36:16,180 --> 04:36:16,520
Shut up.

3722
04:36:16,620 --> 04:36:17,860
You guys were bothering me.

3723
04:36:24,700 --> 04:36:25,720
Guess nothing new.

3724
04:36:27,680 --> 04:36:28,760
I don't even think it worked.

3725
04:36:30,480 --> 04:36:30,860
Ah.

3726
04:36:35,240 --> 04:36:37,200
Why don't they give me...

3727
04:36:40,020 --> 04:36:41,700
Yeah, it worked to alert them.

3728
04:36:43,320 --> 04:36:44,380
Everything is bad.

3729
04:36:46,700 --> 04:36:50,560
You don't think they'll come in here, right?

3730
04:36:56,180 --> 04:36:56,900
Need C4.

3731
04:36:57,300 --> 04:36:57,660
Oh, wait.

3732
04:36:57,720 --> 04:36:58,560
I think you get this.

3733
04:36:59,420 --> 04:37:03,880
I think you get it in that other little hut, maybe.

3734
04:37:05,520 --> 04:37:07,060
You think they can see my hat from...

3735
04:37:07,060 --> 04:37:07,300
Oh, wait.

3736
04:37:07,360 --> 04:37:08,260
It doesn't...

3737
04:37:08,260 --> 04:37:08,860
Oh, it does clip.

3738
04:37:10,980 --> 04:37:12,180
You think they saw that?

3739
04:37:30,270 --> 04:37:33,310
That would be insane.

3740
04:37:36,990 --> 04:37:38,870
I kind of messed up, guys.

3741
04:37:40,510 --> 04:37:42,090
I messed up.

3742
04:37:43,330 --> 04:37:44,530
I done goofed.

3743
04:37:46,650 --> 04:37:48,090
I done goofed.

3744
04:37:55,430 --> 04:37:57,630
I did a little whoopsie.

3745
04:38:10,830 --> 04:38:12,940
Do you think I can make it?

3746
04:38:20,080 --> 04:38:21,320
Is he?

3747
04:38:33,150 --> 04:38:34,410
I hear footsteps.

3748
04:38:38,030 --> 04:38:38,890
I hear footsteps.

3749
04:38:52,860 --> 04:38:53,580
Oh, wait.

3750
04:38:53,800 --> 04:38:54,280
I hear footsteps.

3751
04:39:07,200 --> 04:39:08,820
HQ, please respond.

3752
04:39:09,700 --> 04:39:10,280
This is HQ.

3753
04:39:11,500 --> 04:39:12,420
Patrol here.

3754
04:39:13,460 --> 04:39:15,800
Enemy sighted, commencing attack.

3755
04:39:19,960 --> 04:39:21,040
Close the door.

3756
04:39:39,690 --> 04:39:40,810
Oh my gosh.

3757
04:39:41,070 --> 04:39:41,570
Oh my gosh, get up.

3758
04:39:41,590 --> 04:39:41,930
Get up, Snake.

3759
04:39:42,210 --> 04:39:42,630
Get up, Snake.

3760
04:39:43,390 --> 04:39:43,850
Get up, Snake.

3761
04:39:50,700 --> 04:39:51,980
Killing your comrades.

3762
04:40:10,370 --> 04:40:11,670
There's so many men here.

3763
04:40:12,110 --> 04:40:12,230
Wow.

3764
04:40:13,710 --> 04:40:15,630
There's a whole lot of guys in here.

3765
04:40:15,990 --> 04:40:17,130
Ah, why?

3766
04:40:17,710 --> 04:40:18,810
Why are you hurting?

3767
04:40:18,890 --> 04:40:19,470
Look at the cross.

3768
04:40:19,490 --> 04:40:20,550
Look at it, it's so funny.

3769
04:40:21,070 --> 04:40:22,170
Okay, I'll get it after.

3770
04:40:26,550 --> 04:40:28,510
Oh, that's where you are.

3771
04:40:29,810 --> 04:40:30,970
I see one.

3772
04:40:31,570 --> 04:40:32,890
I hear two, I think.

3773
04:40:33,010 --> 04:40:34,250
Oh, the alert's going down.

3774
04:40:35,110 --> 04:40:35,710
They're stupid.

3775
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:36,810
They don't know what's going on.

3776
04:40:46,490 --> 04:40:47,370
They're stupid.

3777
04:40:48,330 --> 04:40:48,710
Damn.

3778
04:40:58,150 --> 04:41:00,090
Are we getting away with this for real?

3779
04:41:07,820 --> 04:41:09,480
Are we getting away with this for real?

3780
04:41:10,800 --> 04:41:11,940
Oh, there's that guy right there.

3781
04:41:15,500 --> 04:41:15,980
HQ.

3782
04:41:17,680 --> 04:41:18,400
This is HQ.

3783
04:41:19,820 --> 04:41:20,380
Control here.

3784
04:41:21,420 --> 04:41:22,020
There he goes.

3785
04:41:22,060 --> 04:41:24,260
We lost sight of the intruder going into high alert.

3786
04:41:26,400 --> 04:41:27,740
Let's put back our crocsuit.

3787
04:41:31,420 --> 04:41:33,120
The enemy is still nearby.

3788
04:41:33,440 --> 04:41:34,460
Pursue and engage him.

3789
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:35,460
No.

3790
04:41:37,220 --> 04:41:39,480
They're gonna come from this way, don't they?

3791
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:41,580
Actually, this is the way I need to go, right?

3792
04:41:41,660 --> 04:41:43,120
Oh, that didn't mean to do that.

3793
04:41:46,980 --> 04:41:47,740
Is it this way?

3794
04:41:50,200 --> 04:41:52,320
No, this is the other little hut.

3795
04:41:57,720 --> 04:42:00,380
I'm lost in the south, thank you.

3796
04:42:00,820 --> 04:42:02,800
I should have never tried to blow up your helicopter.

3797
04:42:06,820 --> 04:42:08,160
I should have never tried.

3798
04:42:09,480 --> 04:42:10,700
for my arrogance.

3799
04:42:12,860 --> 04:42:13,820
Oh, I should cure.

3800
04:42:14,140 --> 04:42:14,660
I'm stupid.

3801
04:42:16,120 --> 04:42:17,440
My wound is open.

3802
04:42:18,160 --> 04:42:18,720
Disinfect.

3803
04:42:21,720 --> 04:42:22,720
Oh, easy.

3804
04:42:23,060 --> 04:42:23,540
Okay, cool.

3805
04:42:24,300 --> 04:42:25,500
It was funny, though.

3806
04:42:26,660 --> 04:42:27,300
Here we go.

3807
04:42:30,040 --> 04:42:31,060
On the road again.

3808
04:42:32,400 --> 04:42:32,680
Wait.

3809
04:42:33,280 --> 04:42:35,480
Is this whole cutscene gonna be...

3810
04:42:36,460 --> 04:42:37,240
Wait a second.

3811
04:42:37,820 --> 04:42:39,020
Wait, is this whole thing...

3812
04:42:39,020 --> 04:42:39,460
Oh, no.

3813
04:42:39,480 --> 04:42:40,520
Oh no!

3814
04:42:44,560 --> 04:42:45,040
No!

3815
04:42:46,560 --> 04:42:48,380
I want to put on the Crockett.

3816
04:42:56,150 --> 04:42:57,510
Ah, you're here at last.

3817
04:42:58,670 --> 04:43:00,210
Looks like the boss's info was right.

3818
04:43:12,700 --> 04:43:14,680
Twice now you've made me taste for the defeat.

3819
04:43:19,380 --> 04:43:20,340
Yes, sir!

3820
04:43:24,400 --> 04:43:26,580
Oh my gosh, our first boss, you guys.

3821
04:43:28,880 --> 04:43:34,240
I hate to disappoint the Cobras, but you're mine now.

3822
04:43:35,580 --> 04:43:35,920
Oh.

3823
04:43:36,800 --> 04:43:37,180
Oh.

3824
04:43:37,500 --> 04:43:38,880
Oh, all of you, leave us.

3825
04:43:38,920 --> 04:43:40,680
Oh, Ocelots are such prideful creatures.

3826
04:43:41,620 --> 04:43:44,160
The way it keeps chopping.

3827
04:43:44,540 --> 04:43:45,300
It's just you and me.

3828
04:43:46,940 --> 04:43:50,640
Every time it cuts the scene, Ocelots are proud creatures.

3829
04:43:50,860 --> 04:43:51,180
Yeah!

3830
04:43:52,040 --> 04:43:53,400
They prefer to hunt alone.

3831
04:44:16,320 --> 04:44:17,220
Twelve shots.

3832
04:44:21,900 --> 04:44:24,240
Yes, keep going, King!

3833
04:44:25,080 --> 04:44:25,360
Yes!

3834
04:44:31,190 --> 04:44:34,030
This time I've got 12 shots.

3835
04:44:36,010 --> 04:44:39,430
Oh, you are such a frightening creature.

3836
04:44:47,640 --> 04:44:48,360
Draw!

3837
04:44:53,070 --> 04:44:54,890
Okay, one moment, please.

3838
04:44:55,210 --> 04:44:56,750
Let me fix my outfit.

3839
04:44:58,070 --> 04:45:00,310
Well, we really don't need it, but, you know.

3840
04:45:02,310 --> 04:45:03,450
What am I using?

3841
04:45:04,070 --> 04:45:05,030
Okay, oh, interesting.

3842
04:45:05,210 --> 04:45:09,370
It shows you the number of bullets he has up there and his health.

3843
04:45:11,970 --> 04:45:12,850
We shall...

3844
04:45:12,850 --> 04:45:14,750
I wish I could take my suppressor off.

3845
04:45:17,070 --> 04:45:18,990
Because I don't want to...

3846
04:45:20,890 --> 04:45:22,630
I don't want to use it all up.

3847
04:45:24,410 --> 04:45:25,090
You know?

3848
04:45:26,950 --> 04:45:27,570
Yeah, that's...

3849
04:45:27,570 --> 04:45:27,850
Oh, no, I'm not.

3850
04:45:27,870 --> 04:45:29,030
I meant the location, sorry.

3851
04:45:30,730 --> 04:45:32,330
The location of the...

3852
04:45:32,330 --> 04:45:33,810
of the... his...

3853
04:45:33,810 --> 04:45:34,230
HP.

3854
04:45:36,750 --> 04:45:37,870
If I do...

3855
04:45:38,450 --> 04:45:40,910
I try it, wait, it does say attach... Oh!

3856
04:45:41,490 --> 04:45:42,790
Oh my gosh, I'm blind.

3857
04:45:43,090 --> 04:45:45,230
I was like, oh, it doesn't say it, no!

3858
04:45:45,570 --> 04:45:46,530
Oh, it does, okay.

3859
04:45:46,850 --> 04:45:48,070
Look at the way he runs.

3860
04:45:48,890 --> 04:45:51,690
And then I'm gonna switch to... No, not that.

3861
04:45:52,270 --> 04:45:53,710
I'm gonna switch to this, sorry.

3862
04:45:54,130 --> 04:45:56,030
I'm so brain dead from this weekend.

3863
04:45:56,250 --> 04:45:57,110
Look at him go.

3864
04:46:05,020 --> 04:46:05,560
No!

3865
04:46:05,680 --> 04:46:06,440
Don't shoot me!

3866
04:46:07,420 --> 04:46:08,280
Thank you.

3867
04:46:11,720 --> 04:46:12,260
Wait.

3868
04:46:16,740 --> 04:46:16,960
Ow!

3869
04:46:17,220 --> 04:46:17,900
Ouch, ow, ow, ow!

3870
04:46:25,190 --> 04:46:26,150
The thrill.

3871
04:46:33,870 --> 04:46:35,330
Look at him!

3872
04:46:35,990 --> 04:46:36,530
Please!

3873
04:46:37,050 --> 04:46:38,330
Let me have him, please!

3874
04:46:38,830 --> 04:46:39,530
Oh my god.

3875
04:46:42,650 --> 04:46:43,530
It's exhilarating!

3876
04:46:47,470 --> 04:46:47,910
Damn.

3877
04:46:48,410 --> 04:46:48,850
Excellent.

3878
04:47:04,990 --> 04:47:05,430
Getting him?

3879
04:47:05,510 --> 04:47:07,190
Oh, I think my drop-off is too bad.

3880
04:47:07,630 --> 04:47:09,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

3881
04:47:10,990 --> 04:47:13,030
Just like camping behind this little rock.

3882
04:47:18,680 --> 04:47:19,160
Oh, that's a goat.

3883
04:47:23,750 --> 04:47:24,570
Where are you?

3884
04:47:25,570 --> 04:47:26,250
Where'd you go?

3885
04:47:27,390 --> 04:47:29,350
I'm trying to find- I want to watch you!

3886
04:47:30,110 --> 04:47:31,490
I want to watch you reload!

3887
04:47:31,650 --> 04:47:32,410
Where are you?

3888
04:47:34,650 --> 04:47:35,250
Where?

3889
04:47:35,770 --> 04:47:35,890
Oh.

3890
04:47:36,710 --> 04:47:37,110
Ah.

3891
04:47:37,890 --> 04:47:38,590
Oh, there you are.

3892
04:47:48,620 --> 04:47:48,980
Yeah?

3893
04:47:49,820 --> 04:47:50,160
Here.

3894
04:48:00,460 --> 04:48:03,900
Please don't, please don't.

3895
04:48:12,390 --> 04:48:13,250
I'm gonna cure.

3896
04:48:15,610 --> 04:48:20,410
You see me press B all the time because it used to be, it was circle, you know.

3897
04:48:21,190 --> 04:48:26,270
So I always, I'm always pressing back because I'm so used to it.

3898
04:48:30,070 --> 04:48:30,470
Disinfect.

3899
04:48:31,770 --> 04:48:33,270
And then my bandage.

3900
04:48:33,590 --> 04:48:34,190
Oh, suture.

3901
04:48:34,790 --> 04:48:35,430
Oh, not the suture.

3902
04:48:35,610 --> 04:48:36,430
Ah, I used it.

3903
04:48:36,710 --> 04:48:37,130
What was it?

3904
04:48:37,190 --> 04:48:37,690
Oh, the bleeding.

3905
04:48:37,930 --> 04:48:38,350
There we go.

3906
04:48:39,190 --> 04:48:47,860
There probably is a way to remap, but I...

3907
04:48:48,540 --> 04:48:49,840
I don't... It's... You know, it's okay.

3908
04:49:06,330 --> 04:49:06,730
Damn.

3909
04:49:07,050 --> 04:49:07,750
I almost had him.

3910
04:49:08,210 --> 04:49:08,970
Okay, let's reload.

3911
04:49:09,510 --> 04:49:09,850
Reload.

3912
04:49:10,170 --> 04:49:10,310
Reload.

04:50:13,080 --> 04:50:14,000
Oh, oh!

That was so romantic!

3920
04:50:15,940 --> 04:50:16,720
Oh my god!

3921
04:50:17,740 --> 04:50:18,820
Wow, wow!

3922
04:50:19,480 --> 04:50:20,260
I'm getting hungry.

3923
04:50:22,960 --> 04:50:24,940
Let's eat our reticulated python.

3924
04:50:28,520 --> 04:50:30,620
That was so romantic!

3925
04:50:30,900 --> 04:50:32,760
We shot each other at the same time!

3926
04:50:34,980 --> 04:50:35,700
Wow!

3927
04:50:37,640 --> 04:50:38,240
Love that.

3928
04:50:38,260 --> 04:50:40,520
I'm doing this with the Crock-Cat the whole time.

3929
04:50:41,840 --> 04:50:42,520
Oh

3930
04:50:46,190 --> 04:50:48,950
my god, he's doing it at double speed.

3931
04:50:49,410 --> 04:50:50,390
Oh my god.

3932
04:50:50,910 --> 04:50:52,070
Oh my god.

3933
04:50:53,190 --> 04:50:55,010
Oh my god.

3934
04:50:55,090 --> 04:50:55,170
Jeez.

3935
04:50:56,730 --> 04:50:58,270
It's so funny.

3936
04:50:59,830 --> 04:51:00,370
Where are you?

3937
04:51:01,110 --> 04:51:01,330
Oh.

3938
04:51:02,190 --> 04:51:03,250
Got his ass.

3939
04:51:09,400 --> 04:51:11,720
He was so exhilarated.

3940
04:51:13,440 --> 04:51:14,420
Damn it.

3941
04:51:15,120 --> 04:51:16,500
He found us.

3942
04:51:16,540 --> 04:51:16,920
No!

3943
04:51:18,400 --> 04:51:18,620
Huh?

3944
04:51:19,240 --> 04:51:19,700
Uh oh.

3945
04:51:21,360 --> 04:51:22,460
The bees!

3946
04:51:25,060 --> 04:51:26,080
The bees!

3947
04:51:42,950 --> 04:51:45,350
Wait, I want to see what he looks like.

3948
04:51:45,890 --> 04:51:46,050
Eww!

3949
04:51:46,710 --> 04:51:47,830
Oh, nasty!

3950
04:51:51,630 --> 04:51:53,270
Now get out of here all this lot, unit.

3951
04:51:59,510 --> 04:52:00,390
If he can.

3952
04:52:16,490 --> 04:52:17,630
You were lucky.

3953
04:52:17,630 --> 04:52:19,470
We'll meet again.

3954
04:52:19,650 --> 04:52:20,550
Oh, yeah, we will.

3955
04:52:23,990 --> 04:52:24,630
Amazing.

3956
04:52:25,150 --> 04:52:25,470
Thank you.

3957
04:52:29,730 --> 04:52:29,930
Woo!

3958
04:52:31,670 --> 04:52:32,310
I

3959
04:52:35,500 --> 04:52:37,260
love a good snake yell.

3960
04:52:38,760 --> 04:52:41,440
It really comes from the throat, you know.

3961
04:52:43,540 --> 04:52:45,080
I got animals.

3962
04:52:53,640 --> 04:52:53,800
Oh, wait.

3963
04:52:53,920 --> 04:52:56,360
Let's, uh...

3964
04:52:57,920 --> 04:52:58,560
Attach.

3965
04:53:01,520 --> 04:53:02,240
Our...

3966
04:53:03,990 --> 04:53:07,970
I can't

3967
04:53:16,640 --> 04:53:17,420
see anything.

3968
04:53:19,760 --> 04:53:21,640
Look at all them crabs!

3969
04:53:24,580 --> 04:53:25,900
So many.

3970
04:53:27,700 --> 04:53:29,900
Oh gosh, I can't see... I can't see anything.

3971
04:53:32,740 --> 04:53:36,600
It's like Ocelot was showing Snake is cool twirly, but...

3972
04:53:37,580 --> 04:53:39,260
Crab battle, yeah.

3973
04:53:40,600 --> 04:53:41,440
Where did I come from?

3974
04:53:41,620 --> 04:53:42,440
Okay, over here.

3975
04:53:48,690 --> 04:53:50,570
I always do the wrong one.

3976
04:53:51,130 --> 04:53:51,250
Help!

3977
04:53:53,910 --> 04:53:55,270
Snake, are you okay?

3978
04:53:55,590 --> 04:53:55,810
Snake!

3979
04:53:56,770 --> 04:53:56,890
Major.

3980
04:53:57,850 --> 04:53:58,090
Snake.

3981
04:53:59,270 --> 04:54:00,070
Are you all right?

3982
04:54:00,470 --> 04:54:01,270
You're not hurt?

3983
04:54:01,930 --> 04:54:02,190
No.

3984
04:54:02,810 --> 04:54:04,830
That was a hell of a drop, but I'm fine.

3985
04:54:05,690 --> 04:54:06,890
Looks like there's no way back up, though.

3986
04:54:06,890 --> 04:54:07,650
You were just ordered right during stream.

3987
04:54:08,330 --> 04:54:09,190
Thanks for ordering.

3988
04:54:09,310 --> 04:54:10,530
Well, anyway, it's good to hear you're not injured.

3989
04:54:10,750 --> 04:54:11,330
Even you?

3990
04:54:12,090 --> 04:54:12,850
Your profile, Victor?

3991
04:54:13,150 --> 04:54:14,830
But getting into that cave was.

3992
04:54:15,230 --> 04:54:26,330
proceed further into the cave the cave seems to be structured like a maze but there's an exit somewhere find a way out of the cave and head for the aqueduct okay wait

3993
04:54:33,580 --> 04:54:54,440
snake are you all right yeah just barely what the hell were all those hornets most likely that was the pain one of the cobras i figured as much are they tracking me i don't know the cobras only take orders from the Even Volgin knows what they're really up to.

3994
04:54:54,740 --> 04:54:56,420
So I don't know anything about them either.

3995
04:54:57,120 --> 04:54:57,460
No kidding.

3996
04:54:58,360 --> 04:55:00,380
I'll try and dig up as much as I can about them.

3997
04:55:00,780 --> 04:55:02,620
You just focus on moving ahead.

3998
04:55:02,980 --> 04:55:07,080
Go to the end of the cave and you'll come out in an aqueduct overgrown with mangroves.

3999
04:55:07,700 --> 04:55:09,460
This leads to the Pony Zovier Swamp.

4000
04:55:09,800 --> 04:55:11,040
Pony Zovier Swamp.

4001
04:55:11,260 --> 04:55:11,820
Be careful.

4002
04:55:12,940 --> 04:55:13,900
That cave...

4003
04:55:13,900 --> 04:55:15,400
Is pitch dark inside.

4004
04:55:15,760 --> 04:55:16,060
Yeah.

4005
04:55:16,260 --> 04:55:16,520
Good.

4006
04:55:16,820 --> 04:55:18,460
I did remember to tell you then.

4007
04:55:20,080 --> 04:55:56,310
If it's completely dark and you need a light, try using a torch i heard there's some emergency torches stored somewhere in that cave torches got it so where are they yeah huh where are the torches how should i know go find them yourself eva dark wait i want to see the tip wait did i press the wrong one which one is it this is this tip view tip oh look at that the dark cave is great they reduce visibility wait verse is also on Sola leaves himself open to attack while he's reloading.

4008
04:55:56,450 --> 04:55:58,630
Keep an eye on his remaining ammo under the life gate.

4009
04:55:58,870 --> 04:55:59,490
Oh, wow.

4010
04:56:00,210 --> 04:56:01,590
Oh, how cute!

4011
04:56:02,050 --> 04:56:02,590
These are so...

4012
04:56:03,950 --> 04:56:04,510
Shake.

4013
04:56:04,770 --> 04:56:05,570
Oh, look at him.

4014
04:56:05,570 --> 04:56:05,950
Shake.

4015
04:56:07,230 --> 04:56:07,510
Gakko.

4016
04:56:09,870 --> 04:56:10,990
Kero-tan.

4017
04:56:12,190 --> 04:56:12,550
Store.

4018
04:56:12,730 --> 04:56:13,230
Oh.

4019
04:56:16,830 --> 04:56:17,390
Okay.

4020
04:56:17,710 --> 04:56:17,990
Okay.

4021
04:56:18,730 --> 04:56:20,010
I can't see anything.

4022
04:56:20,650 --> 04:56:21,070
Thank you.

4023
04:56:23,590 --> 04:56:24,210
I don't know.

4024
04:56:24,230 --> 04:56:27,470
I don't have anything other than thermal, right?

4025
04:56:27,570 --> 04:56:28,890
I didn't grab a night vision.

4026
04:56:30,270 --> 04:56:30,890
I remember.

4027
04:56:33,050 --> 04:56:34,250
Can't freaking see.

4028
04:56:37,090 --> 04:56:38,510
I can't see anything.

4029
04:56:42,650 --> 04:56:44,190
Can your eyes adjust to the darkness in this one?

4030
04:56:44,310 --> 04:56:45,090
That's a good question.

4031
04:56:47,630 --> 04:56:49,150
Let's see, what else do I have in my backpack?

4032
04:56:51,230 --> 04:56:55,210
Um, which is, I mean, I do have live medicine, how many?

4033
04:56:55,890 --> 04:56:56,330
one.

4034
04:56:58,290 --> 04:56:58,530
Um.

4035
04:57:02,980 --> 04:57:03,500
Nothing.

4036
04:57:09,290 --> 04:57:10,570
Where even were the...

4037
04:57:10,570 --> 04:57:12,050
Where even are the night vision?

4038
04:57:16,980 --> 04:57:17,400
Oh, wait.

4039
04:57:17,460 --> 04:57:18,160
There's our cigar.

4040
04:57:18,420 --> 04:57:19,160
Let's try that.

4041
04:57:21,100 --> 04:57:22,420
Does that give any light?

4042
04:57:22,540 --> 04:57:24,280
Oh, the tiniest bit.

4043
04:57:26,440 --> 04:57:26,960
Okay.

4044
04:57:27,660 --> 04:57:30,240
Oh, I think actually our eyes are adjusting.

4045
04:57:30,460 --> 04:57:31,660
I can see so much better now.

4046
04:57:33,120 --> 04:57:33,820

4050
04:58:17,830 --> 04:58:18,230
Wait!

4051
04:58:19,630 --> 04:58:20,650
AK-47.

4052
04:58:20,810 --> 04:58:21,050
Holy cow.

4053
04:58:21,270 --> 04:58:24,150
They glow so nice in this game!

4054
04:58:25,910 --> 04:58:26,430
Wow!

4055
04:58:32,250 --> 04:58:34,630
They're like actually glowing.

4056
04:58:37,150 --> 04:58:37,970
Crab battling.

4057
04:58:40,950 --> 04:58:41,710
Come on.

4058
04:58:42,110 --> 04:58:43,250
It's just one little crab.

4059
04:58:43,910 --> 04:58:44,410
Come on.

4060
04:58:44,770 --> 04:58:45,390
Come on.

4061
04:58:45,690 --> 04:58:46,050
Come on.

4062
04:58:46,210 --> 04:58:46,670
You crab.

4063
04:58:47,250 --> 04:58:47,630
Come on.

4064
04:58:47,630 --> 04:58:48,110
I'll get you.

4065
04:58:48,350 --> 04:58:48,770
I'll get you.

4066
04:58:49,870 --> 04:58:50,930
I got him good.

4067
04:58:53,790 --> 04:58:54,890
That took forever.

4068
04:58:59,670 --> 04:59:00,270
Let's see.

4069
04:59:00,850 --> 04:59:02,990
I saw a hole over there.

4070
04:59:08,670 --> 04:59:09,990
There's a hole there.

4071
04:59:13,490 --> 04:59:15,530
Is that something at the bottom of the water?

4072
04:59:19,760 --> 04:59:20,720
I see stuff.

4073
04:59:24,180 --> 04:59:25,100
And I, yeah, I will.

4074
04:59:25,120 --> 04:59:27,920
do the call about the mushrooms because I like that one.

4075
04:59:28,000 --> 04:59:28,560
I think it's funny.

4076
04:59:34,380 --> 04:59:34,560
Oh!

4077
04:59:37,220 --> 04:59:37,700
Yeah,

4078
04:59:44,170 --> 04:59:45,670
I love the mushroom call.

4079
04:59:52,270 --> 04:59:52,770
Dive, snake.

4080
04:59:53,450 --> 04:59:54,110
Keep pressing B.

4081
04:59:58,570 --> 05:00:03,350
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming.

4082
05:00:04,710 --> 05:00:06,270
Swimming so fast.

4083
05:00:07,910 --> 05:00:09,670
Faster than anyone has ever gone before.

4084
05:00:14,720 --> 05:00:17,000
I would like to find...

4085
05:00:17,840 --> 05:00:19,860
The torches, though, for real.

4086
05:00:20,520 --> 05:00:20,740
Oh!

4087
05:00:21,300 --> 05:00:21,660
Look at that.

4088
05:00:29,460 --> 05:00:30,760
I'm fast.

4089
05:00:31,320 --> 05:00:32,180
I'm fast.

4090
05:00:32,740 --> 05:00:34,280
We're gonna avoid drowning.

4091
05:00:35,160 --> 05:00:35,760
Don't worry.

4092
05:00:37,820 --> 05:00:39,260
I'm so fast.

4093
05:00:44,470 --> 05:00:45,110
Yay!

4094
05:00:45,510 --> 05:00:46,410
You two?

4095
05:00:47,850 --> 05:00:49,910
Everybody's got the...

4096
05:00:49,910 --> 05:00:52,910
The Ocelot profile picture.

4097
05:00:57,230 --> 05:00:59,010
There should be a... Oh, wrong button.

4098
05:00:59,290 --> 05:01:00,130
There should be a mountain.

4099
05:01:02,490 --> 05:01:03,110
Yes.

4100
05:01:04,970 --> 05:01:05,290
What?

4101
05:01:06,870 --> 05:01:10,390
I think... Wait, I do see that there's stuff over here in this.

4102
05:01:13,050 --> 05:01:15,330
We managed to avoid drowning.

4103
05:01:18,550 --> 05:01:28,130
why is it suddenly so bright in here huh there it is oh my gosh wow wow i can see everything now

4104
05:01:31,970 --> 05:01:48,300

4105
05:01:51,850 --> 05:01:59,790

4106

4107
05:02:43,390 --> 05:02:43,590
Nope.

4108
05:02:44,370 --> 05:02:45,190
These are dead people.

4109
05:02:47,250 --> 05:02:48,030
And a little red.

4110
05:02:49,850 --> 05:02:50,930
Little, little red.

4111
05:02:51,250 --> 05:02:51,550
Little red.

4112
05:02:53,470 --> 05:02:54,490
Bug juice.

4113
05:02:56,050 --> 05:02:57,310
What are the torches?

4114
05:02:59,110 --> 05:03:00,250
No, wait.

4115
05:03:00,570 --> 05:03:01,070
I didn't.

4116
05:03:01,490 --> 05:03:01,650
Wait.

4117
05:03:02,030 --> 05:03:02,190
Huh?

4118
05:03:03,510 --> 05:03:04,790
Oh, man.

4119
05:03:06,970 --> 05:03:08,330
I'm not...

4120
05:03:08,330 --> 05:03:09,090
I'm not...

4121
05:03:09,090 --> 05:03:09,210
Oh.

4122
05:03:09,230 --> 05:03:11,190
It took away my light!

4123
05:03:13,530 --> 05:03:14,910
Let's go back.

4124
05:03:18,490 --> 05:03:19,190
Oh no!

4125
05:03:19,550 --> 05:03:21,310
Our eyes need to adjust again!

4126
05:03:23,530 --> 05:03:24,150
Wait.

4127
05:03:24,930 --> 05:03:25,390
Am I going?

4128
05:03:27,050 --> 05:03:27,670
Okay.

4129
05:03:31,810 --> 05:03:32,430
Oh.

4130
05:03:33,050 --> 05:03:38,850
Okay, while our eyes adjust, I'm going to go heat up some food.

4131
05:03:39,250 --> 05:03:40,670
I will be right back.

4132
05:03:41,410 --> 05:03:44,610
BRB, all I have to do is throw it in the microwave, so it's not going to take long.

4133
05:03:44,730 --> 05:03:46,230
I'm not going to, like, wait for it to cook.

4134
05:04:44,360 --> 05:04:46,680
Okay, hopefully that doesn't burn down the cafe.

4135
05:04:49,620 --> 05:04:52,040
Okay, we can see again.

4136
05:04:53,000 --> 05:04:53,640
Let's see.

4137
05:04:54,620 --> 05:04:55,920
Where are you?

4138
05:04:57,460 --> 05:04:58,340
And I'm...

4139
05:04:58,340 --> 05:04:58,660
No!

4140
05:04:58,820 --> 05:04:59,380
I was...

4141
05:05:06,330 --> 05:05:07,210
Oh, Rachel.

4142
05:05:07,730 --> 05:05:09,070
I didn't mean to do that.

4143
05:05:19,590 --> 05:05:22,730
Okay, we'll just use the map.

4144
05:05:26,290 --> 05:05:28,610
Oh, oh.

4145
05:05:29,590 --> 05:05:31,270
On the wall, Snake.

4146
05:05:32,230 --> 05:05:33,430
Just hug the walls.

4147
05:05:36,370 --> 05:05:39,010
Usually I am okay with direction.

4148
05:05:45,310 --> 05:05:45,950
Serum.

4149
05:05:47,490 --> 05:05:47,770
I

4150
05:05:51,060 --> 05:05:52,160
have no night vision.

4151
05:05:56,240 --> 05:05:58,520
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

4152
05:05:58,920 --> 05:06:00,060
Wait, I'm at his crotch.

4153
05:06:00,400 --> 05:06:00,960
I didn't mean to.

4154
05:06:01,160 --> 05:06:01,660
I'm sorry.

4155
05:06:05,820 --> 05:06:07,140
I did a banter.

4156
05:06:13,770 --> 05:06:15,270
A flashbang grenade.

4157
05:06:16,210 --> 05:06:17,410
Let's try it.

4158
05:06:19,430 --> 05:06:21,130
Oh, I took it out.

4159
05:06:22,190 --> 05:06:23,590
Because we were getting flashbang.

4160
05:06:35,790 --> 05:06:36,330
Am I in?

4161
05:06:36,350 --> 05:06:36,990
in the wall?

4162
05:06:39,010 --> 05:06:39,450
Yeah.

4163
05:06:43,670 --> 05:06:44,870
Just hug the wall, Snake.

4164
05:06:47,690 --> 05:06:49,210
Snake, I can't see anything.

4165
05:06:52,310 --> 05:06:53,810
Oh, no, Snake, we're getting hungry.

4166
05:06:54,610 --> 05:06:54,850
Wait.

4167
05:06:55,650 --> 05:06:56,790
Is this where I came from?

4168
05:06:57,230 --> 05:06:57,710
Yes.

4169
05:06:58,010 --> 05:06:58,290
Ah!

4170
05:06:59,350 --> 05:07:00,510
Oh, yeah, my cigar.

4171
05:07:00,830 --> 05:07:02,990
I forgot that we actually had something that worked a little bit.

4172
05:07:03,230 --> 05:07:03,710
Oh, wrong.

4173
05:07:04,410 --> 05:07:05,170
Wrong way.

4174
05:07:05,370 --> 05:07:05,830
This way.

4175
05:07:11,090 --> 05:07:12,970
Works the tiniest amount.

4176
05:07:13,530 --> 05:07:13,650
Ah!

4177
05:07:14,530 --> 05:07:15,290
Okay, never mind.

4178
05:07:15,410 --> 05:07:16,390
Everything is bad.

4179
05:07:20,330 --> 05:07:21,650
I just want to have a torch.

4180
05:07:23,250 --> 05:07:23,910
Okay, where are we?

4181
05:07:25,110 --> 05:07:26,850
Okay, that's where we crawled through.

4182
05:07:29,990 --> 05:07:32,110
I got souvenirs I'll cherish forever.

4183
05:07:38,290 --> 05:07:39,930
Favorite thing I got was Ocelot.

4184
05:07:41,710 --> 05:07:42,110
Um...

4185
05:07:42,110 --> 05:07:43,070
Oh wait, I think this is it.

4186
05:07:43,090 --> 05:07:43,550
This is it.

4187
05:07:43,790 --> 05:07:44,130
No!

4188
05:07:46,390 --> 05:07:56,630
I could have sworn it was this here Be do I could have sworn it was with some dead body somewhere

4189
05:08:00,350 --> 05:08:06,650
It's underwater flow Let's get this codex

4190
05:08:13,130 --> 05:08:52,170
I see you have a calorie mate Calorie mate The thing you're holding now I kind of want a calorie block that looks like a cookie try it it's pretty good it's pretty good okay but what is this thing never seen anything like it calorie made is an energy supplement that contains all the proteins lipids vitamins carbohydrates and minerals here comes the ads skip a skip a it's a well-balanced food because of that it's just perfect for giving your body the nutrition it needs in combat it sounds like a space-age food real astronaut food is not very good but that should taste fine yeah you guys like I can't balance out all this jungle food I'm eating.

4191
05:08:52,870 --> 05:08:57,130
It's easy and quick to eat, so it's perfect when you're running late for an important mission in the morning.

4192
05:08:57,290 --> 05:08:57,890
Don't you have a box?

4193
05:08:58,210 --> 05:08:59,410
I think I have several.

4194
05:09:00,490 --> 05:09:00,830
Really?

4195
05:09:01,210 --> 05:09:03,590
Aren't you always keeping people waiting?

4196
05:09:03,750 --> 05:09:04,070
Oh!

4197
05:09:04,530 --> 05:09:09,690
Furthermore, one of Calorie Mate's biggest advantages is that they are all exactly the same portion size.

4198
05:09:10,470 --> 05:09:14,090
So no matter how you eat it, you always get the same nutrients flavor in calories.

4199
05:09:14,090 --> 05:09:15,090
A lot of people have never had it.

4200
05:09:15,290 --> 05:09:50,510
Each Calorie Mate has a set number of calories, so it's easy to keep track of your calorie intake it's not bad all of the geisha girls in japan use calorie mate for watching their calories i see you seem to know a lot about japan don't you yes i love japan yes i love japan hangs up so funny okay is this a dead end or does it didn't look like it on the map.

4201
05:09:54,610 --> 05:09:55,350
Snake, I can't see.

4202
05:09:56,850 --> 05:09:57,230
Snake.

4203
05:09:58,450 --> 05:09:58,850
Snake.

4204
05:10:00,950 --> 05:10:01,990
Wait, I can see now.

4205
05:10:05,950 --> 05:10:07,190
Refuses to elaborate.

4206
05:10:08,330 --> 05:10:09,730
Oh, I guess it is a dead end.

4207
05:10:09,890 --> 05:10:12,010
It looks kind of not like a dead end, but yeah.

4208
05:10:12,650 --> 05:10:15,170
It looks like there's just a tiny little hole there.

4209
05:10:17,430 --> 05:10:21,930
You can eat after you're done with work, Snake.

4210
05:10:26,320 --> 05:10:27,860
Is it under this waterfall?

4211
05:10:37,880 --> 05:10:40,180
Which dead body is the...

4212
05:10:42,240 --> 05:10:43,760
Is the torch with?

4213
05:10:44,800 --> 05:10:46,120
It's like, it's under a...

4214
05:10:46,120 --> 05:10:48,280
It's by a dead body for sure.

4215
05:10:48,440 --> 05:10:51,020
Do you think those are the same crabs that ate Amelia Earhart?

4216
05:11:06,050 --> 05:11:07,030
Let's try the...

4217
05:11:07,570 --> 05:11:07,730
Wait.

4218
05:11:10,730 --> 05:11:12,790
Let's try the mangrove crab.

4219
05:11:12,910 --> 05:11:13,350
I don't think...

4220
05:11:13,350 --> 05:11:14,830
I remember this not being tasty either.

4221
05:11:17,030 --> 05:11:18,070
Pretty tasty.

4222
05:11:19,030 --> 05:11:20,130
I was completely wrong.

4223
05:11:20,650 --> 05:11:21,510
I said tasty.

4224
05:11:21,950 --> 05:11:23,170
I was like, it's not so tasty.

4225
05:11:23,330 --> 05:11:24,510
And then he says pretty tasty.

4226
05:11:28,750 --> 05:11:29,450
The opposite.

4227
05:11:38,100 --> 05:11:38,700
Oh, it's under.

4228
05:11:40,220 --> 05:11:40,720
Weapon.

4229
05:11:53,090 --> 05:11:54,530
I'm going to become big sorrow.

4230
05:11:56,250 --> 05:11:56,410
Yay!

4231
05:11:56,990 --> 05:11:57,210
Yay!

4232
05:11:57,610 --> 05:11:57,710
Yay!

4233
05:12:00,030 --> 05:12:01,250
Paramedic doesn't like it.

4234
05:12:01,330 --> 05:12:01,850
Smells like cats.

4235
05:12:01,870 --> 05:12:02,310
Cat pee.

4236
05:12:04,370 --> 05:12:04,610
Ew.

4237
05:12:05,410 --> 05:12:06,790
Cat pee is a terrible smell.

4238
05:12:10,530 --> 05:12:11,610
So that's kind of valid.

4239
05:12:12,230 --> 05:12:14,050
Oh, I went the wrong way.

4240
05:12:18,960 --> 05:12:19,900
Big Saru the goat.

4241
05:12:20,660 --> 05:12:31,040
It's this guy named Big Saru on YouTube and Twitter and he wears the crock hat and bears the torch and causes all sorts of mischief.

4242
05:12:33,440 --> 05:12:36,140
I've used this loadout to beat the boss in the old version.

4243
05:12:38,560 --> 05:12:40,280
Oh wait, how do I get back up there?

4244
05:12:40,340 --> 05:12:41,640
Oh, I have to crawl, that's right.

4245
05:12:54,860 --> 05:12:55,600
Get that frog.

4246
05:13:00,810 --> 05:13:03,690
He's like a god gamer, especially with these games.

4247
05:13:04,690 --> 05:13:08,650
He knows, like, how the AI work to a T.

4248
05:13:09,550 --> 05:13:10,270
What is this game?

4249
05:13:10,390 --> 05:13:11,210
Never heard of it.

4250
05:13:13,570 --> 05:13:14,690
Never heard of it.

4251
05:13:15,030 --> 05:13:15,890
What is this game?

4252
05:13:16,750 --> 05:13:19,470
It's this brand new game that came out today.

4253
05:13:20,870 --> 05:13:26,270
Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta.

4254
05:13:27,090 --> 05:13:29,610
Metal Gear Delta 3.

4255
05:13:30,170 --> 05:13:31,010
Metal Solid.

4256
05:13:31,650 --> 05:13:32,710
Solid Gear.

4257
05:13:33,550 --> 05:13:35,230
Solid Man Gear.

4258
05:13:35,810 --> 05:13:36,890
Delta 1.

4259
05:13:40,840 --> 05:13:41,450
What?

4260
05:13:42,190 --> 05:13:43,110
There's a map?

4261
05:13:44,970 --> 05:13:47,790
Maybe it just tells me the map thing.

4262
05:13:50,870 --> 05:13:52,970
With my prompt at the beginning.

4263
05:13:54,570 --> 05:13:55,310
I don't remember.

4264
05:13:56,290 --> 05:13:57,490
This up is for...

4265
05:13:58,590 --> 05:13:58,890
Nothing.

4266
05:13:59,350 --> 05:13:59,650
Ouch!

4267
05:14:00,170 --> 05:14:00,350
Ow!

4268
05:14:00,770 --> 05:14:01,310
Oh, the bat!

4269
05:14:01,810 --> 05:14:02,330
The bat!

4270
05:14:09,030 --> 05:14:10,050
I'm scared!

4271
05:14:17,540 --> 05:14:18,140
Ow, my god.

4272
05:14:18,280 --> 05:14:18,760
Still more?

4273
05:14:28,960 --> 05:14:30,720
We're eating good tonight.

4274
05:14:32,840 --> 05:14:33,420
What's that?

4275
05:14:33,640 --> 05:14:33,780
Okay.

4276
05:14:35,580 --> 05:14:36,220
Wait a second.

4277
05:14:38,220 --> 05:14:38,280
Oh.

4278
05:14:39,240 --> 05:14:40,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4279
05:14:41,440 --> 05:14:42,700
Did I go through everything?

4280
05:14:43,260 --> 05:14:45,340
Why does it feel so much smaller than I remember?

4281
05:14:47,040 --> 05:14:48,600
I feel like the cave used to be...

4282
05:14:48,600 --> 05:14:50,340
The cave system was, like, humongous.

4283
05:14:51,460 --> 05:14:52,900
With so many crawly places.

4284
05:14:53,020 --> 05:14:53,940
Did I just miss a bunch?

4285
05:15:05,020 --> 05:15:05,540
Hmm.

4286
05:15:07,880 --> 05:15:10,160
Metal 3, Solid Gear Eater, Delta Snake.

4287
05:15:10,540 --> 05:15:11,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4288
05:15:13,280 --> 05:15:14,660
I feel like it was so much bigger.

4289
05:15:16,660 --> 05:15:18,500
I missed Carotan, yeah.

4290
05:15:27,810 --> 05:15:28,130
Hmm.

4291
05:15:29,490 --> 05:15:31,630
But what did I, where did I miss stuff?

4292
05:15:31,910 --> 05:15:32,850
Oh, wait.

4293
05:15:34,030 --> 05:15:34,810
Up here.

4294
05:15:36,190 --> 05:15:36,930
Wait, wait.

4295
05:15:37,010 --> 05:15:37,310
I can't tell.

4296
05:15:37,330 --> 05:16:06,750

4297
05:16:11,710 --> 05:16:13,530
Down and around.

4298
05:16:17,030 --> 05:16:18,470
Whoa, fancy.

4299
05:16:21,410 --> 05:16:22,190
Yes, okay.

4300
05:16:25,610 --> 05:16:28,350
I don't think there's anything...

4301
05:16:30,370 --> 05:16:31,110
Oh, wait.

4302
05:16:31,430 --> 05:16:32,710
I see a tiny hole.

4303
05:16:33,810 --> 05:16:34,290
Hold on.

4304
05:16:34,550 --> 05:16:35,330
Let's go back in here.

4305
05:16:36,290 --> 05:16:39,190
I see a tiny, tiny part of the map that seems...

4306
05:16:39,190 --> 05:16:40,010
Wait, where am I?

4307
05:16:40,350 --> 05:16:41,410
I'm getting all confused.

4308
05:16:41,710 --> 05:16:43,290
Wait, how did I end up in here?

4309
05:16:48,890 --> 05:16:50,450
I'm getting all turned around.

4310
05:16:50,810 --> 05:16:51,290
Wait, where?

4311
05:16:51,750 --> 05:16:53,370
Ugh, I don't like the toll.

4312
05:16:53,530 --> 05:16:53,790
Wait!

4313
05:16:54,150 --> 05:16:54,670
Okay, you know what?

4314
05:16:54,750 --> 05:16:55,770
I'm already here.

4315
05:16:57,730 --> 05:16:58,890
I'm getting all turned around.

4316
05:16:59,050 --> 05:17:00,030
I can't see anything.

4317
05:17:01,130 --> 05:17:01,410
Ugh!

4318
05:17:03,230 --> 05:17:05,090
Okay, here is...

4319
05:17:05,090 --> 05:17:05,470
Yes.

4320
05:17:05,590 --> 05:17:06,770
Okay, this is...

4321
05:17:06,770 --> 05:17:09,930
Then we'll go back to the waterfall and explore that one area.

4322
05:17:11,030 --> 05:17:12,230
Oh, that's right!

4323
05:17:13,530 --> 05:17:15,210
I don't think I could.

4324
05:17:17,750 --> 05:17:18,970
Let's try it.

4325
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:25,360
No, I know what I'm doing.

4326
05:17:25,500 --> 05:17:26,380
You guys don't know what...

4327
05:17:26,380 --> 05:17:29,240
You guys are not reading my mind, and you don't know what I'm doing.

4328
05:17:30,340 --> 05:17:33,800
And you're saying, you have to do this, but I have another plan.

4329
05:17:34,740 --> 05:17:38,200
You're not reading my mind, and how dare you not do that?

4330
05:17:39,160 --> 05:17:42,180
How dare you not read my mind and know exactly what I'm trying to do?

4331
05:17:48,470 --> 05:18:11,090
okay here we go can i climb this no all right but this is this is this is that part okay okay okay and then i see that tiny little hole in the waterfall room okay i'll go back i just wanted to see what this was since i was getting already confused

4332
05:18:18,080 --> 05:18:20,220
all right come on snake Pick it up.

4333
05:18:25,530 --> 05:18:26,350
I'm reading your mind.

4334
05:18:26,530 --> 05:18:27,930
There are some wild thoughts in there.

4335
05:18:37,870 --> 05:18:39,190
Yeah, that's one of those ledges.

4336
05:18:40,490 --> 05:18:42,770
That's one of those ledges that...

4337
05:18:42,770 --> 05:18:44,750
Oh my god, you're already tired again, Snake.

4338
05:18:45,210 --> 05:18:45,750
I mean, hungry.

4339
05:18:46,750 --> 05:18:51,270
One of those ledges that he can't lift his arms for.

4340
05:18:54,450 --> 05:18:56,110
It's so lost in here.

4341
05:18:57,930 --> 05:19:00,690
Play this dang game a million times.

4342
05:19:01,990 --> 05:19:03,210
This leads to...

4343
05:19:06,770 --> 05:19:07,310
Okay.

4344
05:19:09,110 --> 05:19:09,810
We'll just go.

4345
05:19:15,000 --> 05:19:16,320
He's a growing boy.

4346
05:19:17,360 --> 05:19:18,340
He is indeed.

4347
05:19:21,970 --> 05:19:23,990
Sounds like my tummy right now.

4348
05:19:26,410 --> 05:19:28,930
I don't know how far I'll go in the game.

4349
05:19:29,270 --> 05:19:29,610
We'll see.

4350
05:19:33,540 --> 05:19:37,480
But the little hole I want to go through It was not quite...

4351
05:19:39,240 --> 05:19:40,820
It's down there, I believe.

4352
05:19:43,140 --> 05:19:44,220
Yeah, right there.

4353
05:19:46,220 --> 05:19:46,800
I think.

4354
05:19:59,050 --> 05:19:59,470
Yes.

4355
05:20:00,710 --> 05:20:01,290
There we go.

4356
05:20:03,190 --> 05:20:05,190
I was like, I know this cave is bigger.

4357
05:20:06,090 --> 05:20:06,910
I know it is!

4358
05:20:07,010 --> 05:20:07,970
I know it is!

4359
05:20:08,970 --> 05:20:10,310
And now, okay, now we're...

4360
05:20:10,310 --> 05:20:10,770
Okay, okay, okay.

4361
05:20:12,770 --> 05:20:14,430
But where is Kerotan?

4362
05:20:19,950 --> 05:20:22,450
I like the Aw, we're out

4363
05:20:29,310 --> 05:21:06,710
I'm like kind of jet lagged I'm sorry you're getting sleepy Oh, I came right Oh, yeah Okay Where are we Don't you dare Don't you touch me Don't touch me freak I'm gonna have nightmares I'm gonna have nightmares you can get jet lag going east coast west coast of the United States still a three-hour time difference and I had a busy busy weekend

4364
05:21:12,110 --> 05:21:17,430
oh my

4365
05:21:22,450 --> 05:21:41,370
god oh oh you guys we did it we finally got the night vision goggles we did it we got the night vision you know what this is is this faster i guess maybe i like watching the froggy swim

4366
05:21:47,420 --> 05:21:50,220
maybe this is stupid to do without eating first

4367
05:21:54,130 --> 05:21:56,190
oh gosh okay

4368
05:22:02,260 --> 05:22:10,960
let's eat eat Ah, not too bad.

4369
05:22:11,600 --> 05:22:12,260
Not too bad.

4370
05:22:14,200 --> 05:22:15,580
This one is not good.

4371
05:22:15,960 --> 05:22:16,660
The Russian rations?

4372
05:22:17,520 --> 05:22:17,760
Nasty.

4373
05:22:18,700 --> 05:22:19,400
Disgusting.

4374
05:22:21,180 --> 05:22:21,820
Disgusting.

4375
05:22:27,510 --> 05:22:29,230
Beat the poison frog.

4376
05:22:29,650 --> 05:22:31,370
We gotta make snake throw up.

4377
05:22:31,490 --> 05:22:32,230
We gotta do that.

4378
05:22:38,310 --> 05:22:41,570
My man's gotta be puking his guts out.

4379
05:22:48,500 --> 05:22:48,920
Blah.

4380
05:22:49,140 --> 05:22:49,560
Oh, wait.

4381
05:22:49,740 --> 05:22:50,160
Uh.

4382
05:22:53,710 --> 05:22:55,330
Okay, now we can go fight.

4383
05:22:59,740 --> 05:23:00,700
How long am I playing today?

4384
05:23:01,020 --> 05:23:02,860
Until I feel tired.

4385
05:23:08,240 --> 05:23:10,400
Which I am, but I'm really tired of playing.

4386
05:23:11,940 --> 05:23:13,500
Until I don't want to anymore.

4387
05:23:20,800 --> 05:23:23,580
Okay, before we fight, though, let's go in here.

4388
05:23:26,120 --> 05:23:27,180
And do Kodak.

4389
05:23:34,070 --> 05:24:33,950
oh i see you've caught yourself a tyrant i think you're a west coast streamer the tyrant is native to taiwan and southern china it's quite vicious and carries a potent neurotoxin in its fangs maybe i should eat before no if it bites you go it will be my reward for defeating the pain the cure option to inject yourself with serum sounds interesting don't ask me huh the guide doesn't say if you absolutely have to know then you'll just have to try it and see I didn't say anything what he's wearing the croc at I just saw it maybe I'll talk to you later snake I love it paramedic wait what about these glow shrooms I see you've captured a poison dart frog the poison dart frog is native to the tropical rainforest of Central and South America they normally grow between two and five centimeters in length but for some reason the ones in that area seem to be much bigger than that I think he wears it in the original potent neurotoxin called familiotoxin.

4390
05:24:34,410 --> 05:24:34,910
Familiotoxin.

4391
05:24:35,030 --> 05:24:37,730
Long ago, people used the poison to coat their arrows for hunting.

4392
05:24:38,310 --> 05:24:41,070
Watch out because if you eat one, you'll get food poisoning.

4393
05:24:41,570 --> 05:24:42,030
Rupro.

4394
05:24:42,710 --> 05:24:44,330
Okay, but...

4395
05:24:44,330 --> 05:24:45,890
I see you've caught a vampire bat.

4396
05:24:45,990 --> 05:24:48,410
The vampire bat bites its victims and sucks their blood.

4397
05:24:48,430 --> 05:24:49,770
Why does it have to be vampires?

4398
05:24:50,430 --> 05:24:53,130
Speaking of bats, just save it.

4399
05:24:53,710 --> 05:24:53,970
Huh?

4400
05:24:54,590 --> 05:24:56,750
I know you're going to talk about vampire movies.

4401
05:24:57,170 --> 05:26:01,850
Attack of the Vampire Donuts or Dracula versus the Space hippos or something like that actually I was going to say that bats are known to use supersonic waves to sense their surroundings oh bats use supersonic waves to sense their surroundings okay you just said that by blasting them with a special kind of sound wave alternatively you could try gripping a torch and waving it around with the CQC yeah I've been doing that as for taste I suppose there's no reason you couldn't eat them hmm snake do you hate vampire movies just now you sounded like you really hated them i did yeah oh well no one really likes them do they some people do i like you nimmy nightmare they're fascinating you know like the movie drac don't say it why not just don't are you afraid what you're afraid of vampires aren't you don't be ridiculous but listen there are no such things as vampires They're just a stupid,

4402
05:26:01,990 --> 05:26:02,870
made-up legend.

4403
05:26:03,870 --> 05:26:06,050
And if they do seem real sometimes...

4404
05:26:06,050 --> 05:26:06,890
Let me mention.

4405
05:26:06,970 --> 05:26:07,350
Well, sure.

4406
05:26:08,110 --> 05:26:10,050
You think I'd be afraid of something like that?

4407
05:26:10,650 --> 05:26:11,050
No.

4408
05:26:11,790 --> 05:26:12,350
Exactly.

4409
05:26:13,290 --> 05:26:13,730
Right.

4410
05:26:14,570 --> 05:26:15,850
I'm not afraid of vampires.

4411
05:26:16,730 --> 05:26:17,390
Uh-huh.

4412
05:26:17,690 --> 05:26:18,750
It's just that...

4413
05:26:19,250 --> 05:26:23,690
Whenever somebody starts talking about vampires, I end up dreaming about them that night.

4414
05:26:23,730 --> 05:26:24,190
Yeah!

4415
05:26:24,250 --> 05:26:25,610
And I don't need that right now.

4416
05:26:25,930 --> 05:26:26,850
That's all.

4417
05:26:27,710 --> 05:26:28,270
Okay.

4418
05:26:32,110 --> 05:26:34,790
I see you found some Russian glow caps.

4419
05:26:35,450 --> 05:26:40,450
The Russian glow cap is a kind of luminescent fungus, a mushroom that glows in the dark.

4420
05:26:41,050 --> 05:26:42,910
Why would a mushroom glow in the dark?

4421
05:26:43,450 --> 05:26:45,690
It's bioluminescent, just like a firefly.

4422
05:26:46,250 --> 05:26:49,330
It uses the so-called Luciferin-Luciferase reaction.

4423
05:26:50,030 --> 05:26:59,690
To put it simply, Luciferin reacts with Luciferase in the presence of magnesium 2 plus ions, breaking it down into oxy-Luciferin and carbon dioxide.

4424
05:27:00,550 --> 05:27:05,330
The carbonyl groups and the oxaluciferin are initially in a neutral excited state.

4425
05:27:06,010 --> 05:27:08,530
When they return to their base state, they give off light.

4426
05:27:09,590 --> 05:27:10,290
Did you get all that?

4427
05:27:10,950 --> 05:27:11,590
Not really.

4428
05:27:12,430 --> 05:27:13,450
Oh, he's so dumb.

4429
05:27:13,470 --> 05:27:16,730
By the way, does that mushroom recharge your batteries when you eat it?

4430
05:27:17,230 --> 05:27:17,510
Huh?

4431
05:27:18,110 --> 05:27:22,630
I mean, it seems like if you ate a glowing mushroom, it might recharge your batteries or something.

4432
05:27:23,590 --> 05:27:26,190
Snake, your batteries are organic batteries.

4433
05:27:26,650 --> 05:27:30,390
They produce electricity by utilizing the potential difference between cells.

4434
05:27:30,550 --> 05:27:38,870
Organic batteries are known for their highly efficient energy conversion, but they still rely on chemical reactions between proteins and enzymes to...

4435
05:27:38,870 --> 05:27:40,750
So you're saying they'll get recharged.

4436
05:27:41,470 --> 05:27:42,430
Believe what you want.

4437
05:27:47,510 --> 05:27:50,850
Okay, now let's eat one.

4438
05:27:55,780 --> 05:27:56,480
Hmm.

4439
05:28:00,930 --> 05:28:02,330
Battery recharged!

4440
05:28:04,210 --> 05:28:05,490
Were these ones bad?

4441
05:28:05,490 --> 05:28:08,290
not eaten yet but said to be edible in a pinch

4442
05:28:12,430 --> 05:28:20,270
sick sick okay now let's call her again oh wrong thing

4443
05:28:25,070 --> 05:28:38,850
paramedic what's up you were right about what I ate a Russian glow cap and it charged up my batteries what's wrong I that's That's great.

4444
05:28:39,910 --> 05:28:41,970
Um, Snake, can you excuse me for a second?

4445
05:28:43,850 --> 05:28:45,070
Did you just hear that?

4446
05:28:45,770 --> 05:28:46,010
Yeah.

4447
05:28:46,590 --> 05:28:50,430
There's no way eating a bioluminescent mushroom would cause your batteries to recharge.

4448
05:28:51,310 --> 05:28:52,470
What do you think it means?

4449
05:28:53,190 --> 05:28:53,710
Beats me.

4450
05:28:53,990 --> 05:28:55,150
Maybe it's all in his mind.

4451
05:28:55,930 --> 05:28:57,650
You mean like a placebo effect?

4452
05:28:58,510 --> 05:28:59,330
Why not?

4453
05:28:59,630 --> 05:29:01,070
You've seen how gullible he is.

4454
05:29:01,610 --> 05:29:02,750
Don't say that.

4455
05:29:03,710 --> 05:29:04,950
Should we let him keep believing it?

4456
05:29:05,670 --> 05:29:06,410
Sounds good to me.

4457
05:29:06,530 --> 05:29:07,810
Sounds good to me.

4458
05:29:08,210 --> 05:29:09,090
Snake, I'm back.

4459
05:29:09,870 --> 05:29:12,310
Yes, the Russian gold cap is a glowing mushroom.

4460
05:29:12,750 --> 05:29:14,530
So it'll recharge your batteries when you eat it.

4461
05:29:23,780 --> 05:29:25,200
He's so sweet.

4462
05:29:28,280 --> 05:29:28,900
Oh, Snake.

4463
05:29:29,280 --> 05:29:30,080
He's so sweet.

4464
05:29:32,640 --> 05:29:32,760
Okay.

4465
05:29:34,560 --> 05:29:35,920
Shall we go?

4466
05:29:37,120 --> 05:29:38,000
Wait, what's over here?

4467
05:29:38,140 --> 05:29:39,020
Did I go this way before?

4468
05:29:39,960 --> 05:30:14,580
but no I didn't I missed this part we got oh with a shotgun hello wait leave me alone you know what I'm just gonna go I'm just gonna leave what's in over here wait oh gosh okay remember how I was just like I remember this cave being way bigger.

4469
05:30:16,520 --> 05:30:17,760
I knew what I was talking about.

4470
05:30:20,340 --> 05:30:21,920
I knew what I was talking about.

4471
05:30:24,540 --> 05:30:26,000
We got a snow uniform.

4472
05:30:36,630 --> 05:30:38,230
I was worried you'd miss the shotgun.

4473
05:30:39,610 --> 05:30:46,130
Well, if I'm doing mostly non-lethal anyway, it would be nice to have like as an option.

4474
05:30:46,970 --> 05:30:51,970
Well, even with the other bosses, with the bosses I still like to do non-lethal.

4475
05:30:53,430 --> 05:30:55,270
Holy longest cave ever.

4476
05:30:57,450 --> 05:30:58,050
What is this?

4477
05:31:00,410 --> 05:31:01,690
Oh, I think I know where we are.

4478
05:31:01,910 --> 05:31:02,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

4479
05:31:03,230 --> 05:31:04,330
That was just a big old circle.

4480
05:31:04,710 --> 05:31:06,070
I see Kerala-Tan up there.

4481
05:31:11,770 --> 05:31:12,570
Okie dokie!

4482
05:31:18,990 --> 05:31:21,370
Earlier, Snake said, I believe because I have to for the mission.

4483
05:31:21,750 --> 05:31:24,470
I am thinking his goal ability is actually on purpose by him.

4484
05:31:26,210 --> 05:31:27,710
Miss Minky beating up Grimlock?

4485
05:31:28,230 --> 05:31:29,750
No, you didn't!

4486
05:31:30,910 --> 05:31:32,310
In fact, let's change.

4487
05:31:32,410 --> 05:31:32,650
Oh, wait.

4488
05:31:32,690 --> 05:31:33,910
I'm already wearing my grenades.

4489
05:31:35,690 --> 05:31:40,210
I feel like this fight will be so much easier when I can see where I'm throwing the grenades, so...

4490
05:31:43,550 --> 05:31:44,850
Let's try it, baby!

4491
05:31:48,290 --> 05:31:49,670
What grenades do I have?

4492
05:31:50,130 --> 05:31:50,910
Oh, wait, though.

4493
05:31:50,950 --> 05:31:54,370
But if I'm trying non-lethal, I guess I won't need grenades, huh?

4494
05:31:55,350 --> 05:31:55,750

Dive, dive, dive, dive!

4508
05:33:28,160 --> 05:33:29,800
I can hear him saying it.

4509
05:33:38,150 --> 05:33:39,350
What are you doing?

4510
05:33:40,530 --> 05:33:40,810
Wait.

4511
05:33:41,910 --> 05:33:42,510
Oh, come on!

4512
05:33:42,710 --> 05:33:43,490
Wait, what are you doing?

4513
05:33:46,530 --> 05:33:47,890
Oh, dive, dive, dive!

4514
05:33:50,250 --> 05:33:51,550
My aim is bad.

4515
05:33:52,450 --> 05:33:54,010
I like that we can reload and switch.

4516
05:33:54,030 --> 05:33:55,850
I just learned that as a feature.

4517
05:34:00,230 --> 05:34:01,290
He's totally vibing.

4518
05:34:06,070 --> 05:34:07,650
Oh, can I dive?

4519
05:34:07,950 --> 05:34:10,210
There we go.

4520
05:34:15,790 --> 05:34:16,030
Oop!

4521
05:34:18,170 --> 05:34:19,110
Is that following me?

4522
05:34:19,390 --> 05:34:20,630
Wait, I'm trying to leave.

4523
05:34:29,000 --> 05:34:29,740
Oh wait.

4524
05:34:37,530 --> 05:34:39,410
It's not highlighting him.

4525
05:34:40,330 --> 05:34:40,850
hell.

4526
05:34:43,930 --> 05:34:44,190
Oh, wait.

4527
05:34:45,150 --> 05:34:47,270
I can't...

4528
05:34:47,270 --> 05:34:48,790
Oh, I think I was in a bad spot.

4529
05:34:49,070 --> 05:34:49,730
Dang it!

4530
05:34:51,670 --> 05:34:52,730
Oh, there we go.

4531
05:34:53,030 --> 05:34:53,430
Uh, hello?

4532
05:34:54,050 --> 05:34:54,130
Hello?

4533
05:34:55,010 --> 05:34:55,410
No!

4534
05:34:55,650 --> 05:34:56,630
Not Tommy gun!

4535
05:34:59,910 --> 05:35:05,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4536
05:35:11,410 --> 05:35:12,730
Yeah, luckily we have infinite.

4537
05:35:12,750 --> 05:35:13,490
Grenades.

4538
05:35:17,170 --> 05:35:18,010
Did you see me?

4539
05:35:19,190 --> 05:35:20,470
Oh, ah, ah, ah.

4540
05:35:28,390 --> 05:35:29,290
Wait, did it not?

4541
05:35:29,470 --> 05:35:31,810
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4542
05:35:31,870 --> 05:35:32,170
Wait.

4543
05:35:32,530 --> 05:35:33,990
Oh, I think you shot it back at me.

4544
05:35:40,930 --> 05:35:41,770
Now you go.

4545
05:35:44,010 --> 05:35:46,270
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.

4546
05:35:47,410 --> 05:35:48,690
There's like an auto aim.

4547
05:35:48,790 --> 05:35:49,430
Did you see that?

4548
05:35:50,550 --> 05:35:50,930
Hello?

4549
05:35:52,810 --> 05:35:54,090
Can I turn that off?

4550
05:35:54,310 --> 05:35:55,450
Wait, sorry.

4551
05:35:56,810 --> 05:36:00,310
I think I noticed it earlier and thought it was like a...

4552
05:36:03,620 --> 05:36:07,160
I thought something happened, but...

4553
05:36:09,870 --> 05:36:12,450
Yeah, the grenade arcline is a big improvement.

4554
05:36:14,730 --> 05:36:16,430
Under controls, maybe.

4555
05:36:16,890 --> 05:36:18,110
Oh, aim assist on!

4556
05:36:18,250 --> 05:36:19,230
Oh my gosh.

4557
05:36:20,770 --> 05:36:21,370
Okay.

4558
05:36:21,870 --> 05:36:23,570
I don't want it to be like that.

4559
05:36:23,850 --> 05:36:24,850
That's too easy.

4560
05:36:25,670 --> 05:36:26,210
Okay.

4561
05:36:31,290 --> 05:36:32,170
Okay, uh...

4562
05:36:32,170 --> 05:36:36,310
Oh, that would be first!

4563
05:36:38,290 --> 05:36:38,430
Oh.

4564
05:36:39,410 --> 05:36:39,830
Boom.

4565
05:36:43,090 --> 05:36:43,310
No!

4566
05:36:43,530 --> 05:36:44,030
No, what the heck?

4567
05:37:00,770 --> 05:37:03,770
I don't know if the sun grenade is even doing much, to be honest.

4568
05:37:07,470 --> 05:37:08,650
Oh, come on.

4569
05:37:08,970 --> 05:37:09,410
Ah!

4570
05:37:12,240 --> 05:37:12,680
Ouch!

4571
05:37:13,700 --> 05:37:15,740
I didn't even feel like I...

4572
05:37:18,140 --> 05:37:19,320
Okay, let's eat.

4573
05:37:19,320 --> 05:37:20,340
Oh, wrong button.

4574
05:37:21,080 --> 05:37:21,860
Let's eat.

4575
05:37:22,640 --> 05:37:23,680
Calorie, mate.

4576
05:37:51,890 --> 05:37:52,790
I was gonna grab them.

4577
05:37:55,350 --> 05:37:56,090
Oh my gosh.

4578
05:37:57,510 --> 05:37:58,070
I had to leave.

4579
05:38:00,530 --> 05:38:01,950
I'm getting all the fish.

4580
05:38:10,250 --> 05:38:10,790
Did they...

4581
05:38:10,790 --> 05:38:11,370
Oh, no!

4582
05:38:12,830 --> 05:38:13,350
Sending

4583
05:38:22,310 --> 05:38:23,730
my own thing back at me.

4584
05:38:30,120 --> 05:38:31,680
Wait, how'd you see me?

4585
05:38:31,960 --> 05:38:32,880
Oh my gosh, wait.

4586
05:38:33,360 --> 05:38:34,900
Ah, you jerk.

4587
05:38:38,900 --> 05:38:39,900
Oh, oopsie.

4588
05:38:44,040 --> 05:38:44,960
What's he doing?

4589
05:38:45,700 --> 05:38:47,180
What are you delivering to me?

4590
05:38:48,340 --> 05:38:50,300
No, don't be mean like that.

4591
05:38:51,380 --> 05:38:53,280
Don't say I'm embarrassing myself.

4592
05:39:04,850 --> 05:39:06,850
You're not supposed to flashbang us.

4593
05:39:06,970 --> 05:39:07,590
Ah, no!

4594
05:39:07,850 --> 05:39:08,130
Wait.

4595
05:39:12,300 --> 05:39:13,100
Oh my gosh.

4596
05:39:14,660 --> 05:39:15,240
That's it?

4597
05:39:16,180 --> 05:39:17,180
Wait, seriously?

4598
05:39:17,540 --> 05:39:18,700
He took, like, three hits.

4599
05:39:18,900 --> 05:39:19,140
That's it.

4600
05:39:19,980 --> 05:39:21,180
Why was he so easy?

4601
05:39:23,440 --> 05:39:24,100
Oh, wait.

4602
05:39:24,280 --> 05:39:25,260
Oh, we're on phase two.

4603
05:39:25,460 --> 05:39:26,240
I was like, no way.

4604
05:39:26,420 --> 05:39:26,680
Wait.

4605
05:39:29,640 --> 05:39:30,040
Wait.

4606
05:39:45,460 --> 05:39:46,060
God?

4607
05:39:46,560 --> 05:39:46,780
God?

4608
05:39:48,060 --> 05:39:53,220
Okay, sometimes the dive takes, like, a bit to, uh...

4609
05:39:56,940 --> 05:39:57,540
To...

4610
05:39:57,540 --> 05:40:00,680
Get ready, you know?

4611
05:40:03,480 --> 05:40:04,380
No way!

4612
05:40:04,500 --> 05:40:05,740
How did you see me?

4613
05:40:08,640 --> 05:40:10,200
How did you see me?

4614
05:40:13,340 --> 05:40:14,860
Is it the crock hat?

4615
05:40:16,180 --> 05:40:18,460
Is it my big old snout?

4616
05:40:20,100 --> 05:40:24,080
Is it my big snout?

4617
05:40:24,480 --> 05:40:25,180
Oh, my bad.

4618
05:40:25,400 --> 05:40:26,310
I'm sorry I tried to...

4619
05:40:28,300 --> 05:40:30,100
No, no, no, no, no.

4620
05:40:33,260 --> 05:40:34,180
Did I get him?

4621
05:40:34,940 --> 05:40:35,420
I think I did.

4622
05:40:35,760 --> 05:40:36,320
Dive, please.

4623
05:40:36,660 --> 05:40:38,140
Dive, dive, dive, dive!

4624
05:40:44,270 --> 05:40:46,390
My big snout's sticking out.

4625
05:40:47,910 --> 05:40:49,270
That's so funny.

4626
05:40:52,790 --> 05:40:53,570
Ah, shoot.

4627
05:40:57,490 --> 05:40:58,730
I think I missed.

4628
05:41:00,970 --> 05:41:01,310
Oops.

4629
05:41:02,330 --> 05:41:04,290
Smell the flying fish are crazy.

4630
05:41:05,390 --> 05:41:06,490
They're so funny.

4631
05:41:07,270 --> 05:41:07,630
Oh no!

4632
05:41:07,710 --> 05:41:13,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, please!

4633
05:41:13,330 --> 05:41:14,050
Oh my god!

4634
05:41:14,530 --> 05:41:15,210
Holy hell!

4635
05:41:16,090 --> 05:41:19,450
It is very, very annoying to do that.

4636
05:41:19,470 --> 05:41:46,730
sometimes oh my gosh it like the prompt is it's very slow ah bullet bee eating away at the inside of my body um what am i supposed to do with that do i carve him out oh i got him out yeah we just have a bullet bee that's eating away at my brain you know no no biggie um

4637
05:42:09,320 --> 05:42:10,680
Oh, they're bringing it back to me.

4638
05:42:10,900 --> 05:42:11,080
Okay.

4639
05:42:12,180 --> 05:42:12,500
Whatever.

4640
05:42:13,140 --> 05:42:13,440
Ah!

4641
05:42:17,380 --> 05:42:18,760
I suck at this guy.

4642
05:42:23,540 --> 05:42:24,200
There we go.

4643
05:42:24,400 --> 05:42:25,040
Oh, come on.

4644
05:42:32,290 --> 05:42:33,330
Then we got him a couple times.

4645
05:42:33,530 --> 05:42:33,850
That's bad.

4646
05:42:43,480 --> 05:42:44,560
No, I have to go down.

4647
05:42:58,410 --> 05:42:59,410
Wait, how'd you save me?

4648
05:42:59,550 --> 05:43:01,090
Is it my giant crocodile head?

4649
05:43:04,510 --> 05:43:09,530
And also, I hate that when I go underwater, it unequips everything.

4650
05:43:10,350 --> 05:43:11,850
Wait, why are you doing that?

4651
05:43:12,950 --> 05:43:13,810
It's very annoying.

4652
05:43:13,970 --> 05:43:16,110
Oh, this is good.

4653
05:43:22,520 --> 05:43:24,000
Okay, one more hit!

4654
05:43:30,010 --> 05:43:30,530
I'm leaving.

4655
05:43:46,660 --> 05:43:50,480
I like how you're saying smoke grenades when like, this is also working.

4656
05:43:52,500 --> 05:43:54,540
This is also working.

4657
05:43:56,440 --> 05:43:56,720
No!

4658
05:44:03,080 --> 05:44:04,740
But you're not covered!

4659
05:44:09,360 --> 05:44:10,040
No!

4660
05:44:10,400 --> 05:44:12,700
Oh my gosh, dive, dive, dive.

4661
05:44:15,690 --> 05:44:16,790
The beat armor?

4662
05:44:17,090 --> 05:44:17,910
The beat armor?

4663
05:44:20,350 --> 05:44:22,630
He wasn't covered that much.

4664
05:44:25,170 --> 05:44:26,770
Oh shh, now he is.

4665
05:44:40,210 --> 05:44:41,730
Like the pilot tricks.

4666
05:44:44,190 --> 05:44:44,890
Oh shoot.

4667
05:44:44,890 --> 05:44:45,690
Get him!

4668
05:44:48,770 --> 05:44:49,550
Oh,

4669
05:45:09,490 --> 05:45:09,690
shoot.

4670
05:45:10,690 --> 05:45:14,210
Got him before he could get me.

4671
05:45:15,430 --> 05:45:16,330
Pain relief.

4672
05:45:16,470 --> 05:45:18,270
See his victory against the pain.

4673
05:45:21,730 --> 05:45:22,870
The pain.

4674
05:45:27,050 --> 05:45:27,890
The pain.

4675
05:45:28,010 --> 05:45:28,810
The pain.

4676
05:45:30,150 --> 05:45:30,190
The pain!

4677
05:45:35,710 --> 05:45:36,550
Explode!

4678
05:45:36,810 --> 05:45:38,770
Oh my gosh.

4679
05:45:40,050 --> 05:45:44,110
It made my controller fall off.

4680
05:45:48,150 --> 05:45:49,330
The bird.

4681
05:45:56,630 --> 05:45:57,950
How do I get up there?

4682
05:46:09,310 --> 05:46:29,710
I've been told before that they explode because they don't want their bodies being taken and used for or like experiments I don't know wow we have a lot of vampire bats

4683
05:46:37,230 --> 05:46:43,070
that's damn good Sagan tells you that info

4684
05:46:48,500 --> 05:46:50,800
I thought it was so they can't get captured

4685
05:46:54,190 --> 05:46:57,790
I'm sure it's probably like a thing, though.

4686
05:47:01,820 --> 05:47:07,040
If they're captured and they're tested upon, they just blow up.

4687
05:47:09,360 --> 05:47:11,040
But also, I know there's a Kero-Tan.

4688
05:47:12,700 --> 05:47:13,560
We saw him.

4689
05:47:15,220 --> 05:47:16,900
I wonder if we can still get him from here.

4690
05:47:19,800 --> 05:47:20,280
Yes.

4691
05:47:21,380 --> 05:47:21,940
Oh gosh.

4692
05:47:22,040 --> 05:47:23,380
How high do I need to aim for him?

4693
05:47:25,980 --> 05:47:26,460
Higher?

4694
05:47:26,860 --> 05:47:27,140
Higher?

4695
05:47:28,780 --> 05:47:30,520
I only have nine bullets left.

4696
05:47:37,440 --> 05:47:38,960
Let's do a different gun.

4697
05:47:41,420 --> 05:47:43,580
I didn't even realize how...

4698
05:47:43,580 --> 05:47:43,700
Whoops.

4699
05:47:44,080 --> 05:47:44,880
How low I was.

4700
05:47:45,720 --> 05:47:47,180
I don't know why I do that every time.

4701
05:47:47,420 --> 05:47:47,740
Sorry, guys.

4702
05:47:49,060 --> 05:47:49,420
Meem.

4703
05:47:56,180 --> 05:47:56,880
For you?

4704
05:47:57,400 --> 05:47:57,960
Let's try.

4705
05:47:59,220 --> 05:48:00,140
Oh, my shotgun.

4706
05:48:02,440 --> 05:48:03,600
Where is it?

4707
05:48:09,350 --> 05:48:10,530
pick up that one, right?

4708
05:48:12,310 --> 05:48:14,770
Wait, where's the one that I picked up under the bridge?

4709
05:48:17,030 --> 05:48:19,350
Did I die before I...

4710
05:48:28,130 --> 05:48:28,830
Where is he?

4711
05:48:29,030 --> 05:48:31,090
There he is.

4712
05:48:34,010 --> 05:48:34,290
Easy.

4713
05:48:37,470 --> 05:48:38,890
I don't need no shotgun.

4714
05:48:42,050 --> 05:48:42,870
Wrong gun.

4715
05:48:43,150 --> 05:48:43,670
Doesn't matter.

4716
05:48:47,540 --> 05:48:48,720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

4717
05:48:48,900 --> 05:48:51,300
it was a virtuous mission and we lose everything.

4718
05:48:51,840 --> 05:48:53,060
You guys are so right.

4719
05:48:55,520 --> 05:48:56,180
There we go.

4720
05:48:57,760 --> 05:48:57,780
Yeah!

4721
05:48:58,540 --> 05:48:59,920
Wait, what does that do?

4722
05:49:04,100 --> 05:49:09,540
Wearing it removes any handshake when readying weapons for Atlas was for us a lot.

4723
05:49:10,600 --> 05:49:12,100
Boards off hornets, spiders, and leeches.

4724
05:49:12,960 --> 05:49:15,180
Also allows wearer to tame hornets?

4725
05:49:19,640 --> 05:49:20,740
Hot dog.

4726
05:49:25,160 --> 05:49:31,960
where i guess the hornet's nests what

4727
05:49:35,500 --> 05:49:36,920
i'm a beekeeper

4728
05:49:40,860 --> 05:49:43,020
yeah we'll see what sagan says about this

4729
05:49:46,820 --> 05:49:54,140
the weapon you've got equipped now is a prototype model of the mark 22 a suppressor equipped i'm gonna get my food development by the Navy.

4730
05:49:54,280 --> 05:49:56,780
It's been modified to act as a tranquilizer gun.

4731
05:49:58,080 --> 05:50:03,900
The Mark 22 is a heavily modified special ops version of the M39 pistol used as a sidearm by the seals.

4732
05:50:05,420 --> 05:50:10,940
Probably the biggest change from the M39 is that it's got a longer barrel, which allows it to be equipped with a suppressor.

4733
05:50:11,740 --> 05:50:13,480
And it uses a slide lock mechanism.

4734
05:50:13,880 --> 05:50:19,320
That makes it a lot quieter, but it also means you have to load a new round into the chamber by hand every time you fire.

4735
05:50:20,560 --> 05:50:51,780
It's also fitted with you can use the front and rear sights to line up your shot even with a suppressor attached looks like they got rid of the magazine safety too good eye that feature wasn't too popular with guys like you who know their guns the sheer release lever has been taken off as well meaning the hammer won't fall even with the safety on so I can just cock and lock that and you get the added bonus of not having any mechanical noise from decocking even with the safety on the Perfect pistol for a sneaking mission,

4736
05:50:51,820 --> 05:50:52,360
huh?

4737
05:51:08,380 --> 05:51:09,280
Why are you guys blushing?

4738
05:51:09,820 --> 05:51:10,600
What did I miss?

4739
05:51:14,220 --> 05:51:15,760
Why are you guys blushing?

4740
05:51:16,100 --> 05:51:17,040
What did I miss?

4741
05:51:18,340 --> 05:51:20,580
A cap shake like a crocodile head, you say?

4742
05:51:21,220 --> 05:51:22,740
Yeah, what do you think?

4743
05:51:23,400 --> 05:51:24,520
I think it's a great idea.

4744
05:51:25,460 --> 05:51:29,240
You know, animal disguises are one of the oldest tricks in the book in the intelligence world.

4745
05:51:29,840 --> 05:52:06,360
I don't know whether it's true or not, but I've heard that during World War II, SS used to use cow suits supposedly they sent agents out to hide in herds of real cows so they could spy on enemy units as they passed by I will hold this again nowadays I guess most people wouldn't even give a crocodile shaped cap a second look 24 they think it was just a gag item but if you use it the right way it can be an effective weapon for spying I got a head to you snake you're one sharp guy you okay snake now forget it huh He just wants to make everybody laugh.

4746
05:52:07,860 --> 05:52:09,740
Snake, what's that camouflage?

4747
05:52:10,380 --> 05:52:11,580
It's called Hornet Stripe.

4748
05:52:12,000 --> 05:52:13,040
I got it from the pain.

4749
05:52:13,920 --> 05:52:14,400
No kidding.

4750
05:52:15,100 --> 05:52:16,700
Sounds like a pretty unique design.

4751
05:52:17,220 --> 05:52:20,020
From the looks of it, it's somehow infused with the power of Hornets.

4752
05:52:20,780 --> 05:52:21,980
The power of Hornets?

4753
05:52:22,560 --> 05:52:22,940
Sure.

4754
05:52:23,400 --> 05:52:25,500
When you're wearing that outfit, Hornets won't attack you.

4755
05:52:25,920 --> 05:52:27,280
Neither will spiders or leeches.

4756
05:52:27,560 --> 05:52:27,940
Crazy.

4757
05:52:28,120 --> 05:52:31,040
You might even be able to tame the ones that come flying out of a hive.

4758
05:52:32,120 --> 05:52:33,540
How do you do that?

4759
05:52:34,000 --> 05:52:35,820
How do you tame them?

4760
05:52:41,670 --> 05:52:42,330
It's crazy.

4761
05:52:43,010 --> 05:52:47,590
I see you've got yourself a ration.

4762
05:52:48,650 --> 05:52:51,030
Rations are portable meals carried by Soviet soldiers.

4763
05:52:51,410 --> 05:52:52,050
No, they're not.

4764
05:52:53,510 --> 05:52:56,990
They're disgusting portable meals carried by Soviet soldiers.

4765
05:52:57,670 --> 05:52:58,830
Hey, you should be grateful.

4766
05:52:58,870 --> 05:52:59,170
Thank you.

4767
05:53:00,130 --> 05:53:02,490
Thank you.

4768
05:53:04,090 --> 05:53:05,930
And they're surprisingly good for you too.

4769
05:53:05,950 --> 05:53:06,950
It is a lot of fun.

4770
05:53:07,510 --> 05:53:08,350
You should play it too.

4771
05:53:09,210 --> 05:53:10,330
Even if it's a little rotten.

4772
05:53:11,290 --> 05:53:12,530
You are hopeless.

4773
05:53:15,330 --> 05:53:15,570
Okay.

4774
05:53:18,450 --> 05:53:20,550
I got a little bit more food in my system.

4775
05:53:22,210 --> 05:53:22,730
Onwards.

4776
05:53:25,970 --> 05:53:28,750
What sucks is getting the...

4777
05:53:29,770 --> 05:53:30,970
The... what's it called?

4778
05:53:33,470 --> 05:53:49,710
the camel from the end and then for the rest of oh my god for the rest of the game it's like dark so you can't even really use it oh my gosh you know what's gonna come in handy here a big old craw cat

4779
05:53:53,410 --> 05:53:55,250
oh yamoko moboko

4780
05:54:06,090 --> 05:54:07,810
demon demon

4781
05:54:13,900 --> 05:54:15,900
I'm gonna grab another...

4782
05:54:17,100 --> 05:54:17,460
No.

4783
05:54:18,200 --> 05:54:19,920
I forgot I have limited ammo.

4784
05:54:22,420 --> 05:54:23,840
Ah, that's okay.

4785
05:54:25,940 --> 05:54:28,240
What we're gonna do...

4786
05:54:28,240 --> 05:54:33,900
I guess I could stun them.

4787
05:54:34,100 --> 05:54:35,320
I'll stun them.

4788
05:54:37,080 --> 05:54:39,520
Let's change into...

4789
05:54:39,520 --> 05:54:39,820
You?

4790
05:54:47,850 --> 05:54:49,110
Oh, it didn't work.

4791
05:54:50,150 --> 05:54:52,030
Oh wait, I think they still die, don't they?

4792
05:54:54,930 --> 05:54:55,490
Oops.

4793
05:54:56,650 --> 05:55:00,870
Well, the poison frogs are fine because we can give those to the soldiers and they'll eat it.

4794
05:55:02,430 --> 05:55:03,230
And get sick.

4795
05:55:03,990 --> 05:55:04,910
My eyes!

4796
05:55:05,550 --> 05:55:05,950
Sorry.

4797
05:55:07,930 --> 05:55:10,490
I turned around, to be fair.

4798
05:55:11,790 --> 05:55:12,950
I did turn.

4799
05:55:15,770 --> 05:55:17,950
I didn't look it in the eyes this time.

4800
05:55:21,070 --> 05:55:21,630
Oh.

4801
05:55:22,490 --> 05:55:24,850
I remember this cave.

4802
05:55:25,870 --> 05:55:26,930
I remember here.

4803
05:55:30,290 --> 05:55:30,830
Ammoful.

4804
05:55:32,790 --> 05:55:33,610
Ammoful.

4805
05:55:34,630 --> 05:55:36,150
That's what we need.

4806
05:55:39,070 --> 05:55:40,590
You turn the camera, not snake.

4807
05:55:42,190 --> 05:55:45,290
Ah, that's how it works!

4808
05:55:50,630 --> 05:55:51,290
Ah!

4809
05:55:57,210 --> 05:56:01,870
Oh, let's recharge our batteries.

4810
05:56:08,410 --> 05:56:08,670
Hey.

4811
05:56:09,710 --> 05:56:10,090
Hey.

4812
05:56:11,990 --> 05:56:13,550
Oh, my food is full.

4813
05:56:13,930 --> 05:56:14,550
What can we eat?

4814
05:56:15,050 --> 05:56:16,610
Let's get rid of some vampire badge.

4815
05:56:17,130 --> 05:56:18,110
We don't need this.

4816
05:56:22,370 --> 05:56:23,570
Food history.

4817
05:56:24,270 --> 05:56:24,890
Oh, wow.

4818
05:56:25,510 --> 05:56:26,330
That's kind of fun.

4819
05:56:28,170 --> 05:56:45,970
select dispense there we go false Russian false mango if you're hungry get some food may I offer you a rat I

4820
05:56:57,040 --> 05:57:09,890
love the effect it's so cool don't fall all right Back to the Russian jungle.

4821
05:57:10,430 --> 05:57:12,130
If I, do I fall and die there?

4822
05:57:20,790 --> 05:57:21,670
Do you want to save?

4823
05:57:22,930 --> 05:57:23,410
Mm-hmm.

4824
05:57:27,910 --> 05:57:30,590
Snake, have you seen 007 from Russia with Love?

4825
05:57:30,610 --> 05:57:31,430
Why do you think I'm saving?

4826
05:57:31,550 --> 05:57:33,130
Nah, I don't like those movies.

4827
05:57:33,690 --> 05:57:35,530
Real spies are nothing like James Bond.

4828
05:57:35,690 --> 05:57:36,590
It's pure fantasy.

4829
05:57:37,310 --> 05:57:39,950
Snake, I don't think the major's going to like you saying that.

4830
05:57:40,550 --> 05:57:44,110
And even though it's fiction, I can't help but comparing myself to Bond.

4831
05:57:44,970 --> 05:58:45,070
you like about james bond i mean is it the fantastic gadgets the cars the guns major snake wouldn't you like to have a gun shaped like a pen what good is a pen gonna do me in the jungle i'd look like a fool then what about a snake-shaped gun you can make it look like you're grappling with a giant snake and then get a shot in on the enemy while they're distracted okay now you're being ridiculous we'll make you a snake-shaped gun that folds up and fits into an attache case the way you're worried about how to handle the ladies aren't you no i knew it particularly the truth i don't like the idea of playing hanky panky with enemy fem fatals either but that's part of bond's appeal you could learn a thing or two from him i mean what about this evo what are you planning to do with her i i don't even trust her yet no that's not what i mean you you can't let yourself get involved this is a game of spy versus spy she's using you just as much as you're using her I realize that yeah have a little

4832
05:58:45,070 --> 05:59:11,870
fun the initiative and to do that you have to get the upper hand no strings attached that's what a spy is supposed to do get the upper hand I don't think I'm cut out for that mission maybe if you change your code name to double o snake double o seven is the biggest thing to come out of England since the Mayflower I wouldn't be surprised if they made 20 more of those movies didn't you know The major is a huge James Bond fan.

4833
05:59:12,170 --> 05:59:13,590
Don't get him worked up like this.

4834
05:59:14,430 --> 05:59:14,850
Worked up.

4835
05:59:15,570 --> 05:59:23,370
Maybe you don't realize this, but now that you've got him started talking about Bond, I'm going to have to listen to him lecture for a whole hour after he gets off the radio.

4836
05:59:23,470 --> 05:59:26,450
Snake, after fighting a man who patrols bees, 007 is unrealistic.

4837
05:59:26,550 --> 05:59:28,370
It's too bad you can't enjoy such a great movie, though.

4838
05:59:28,530 --> 05:59:28,830
Right.

4839
05:59:28,990 --> 05:59:32,090
I guess I'm just one of those people who can't enjoy Spyflex.

4840
05:59:33,550 --> 05:59:34,770
I love that one, too.

4841
05:59:38,550 --> 05:59:38,970
Wait.

4842
05:59:39,250 --> 05:59:43,790
I know what we need to wear.

4843
05:59:54,090 --> 05:59:58,210
Major Zero single-handedly funded the franchise until he's dying.

4844
06:00:05,320 --> 06:00:07,080
You think they'll notice?

4845
06:00:11,370 --> 06:00:12,550
I'm gonna test it.

4846
06:00:12,630 --> 06:00:13,450
This is for science.

4847
06:00:13,610 --> 06:00:15,210
I'm just gonna walk on through.

4848
06:00:17,190 --> 06:00:17,710
For science!

4849
06:00:21,610 --> 06:00:23,260
Uh, I'm scared.

4850
06:00:29,560 --> 06:00:30,690
For science!

4851
06:00:40,290 --> 06:00:41,120
Where am I?

4852
06:00:42,450 --> 06:00:43,840
Keep crouching.

4853
06:00:46,640 --> 06:00:47,720
For science?

4854
06:00:48,640 --> 06:00:49,800
Oh, for science!

4855
06:01:01,760 --> 06:01:02,730
It worked!

4856
06:01:06,240 --> 06:01:06,820
It worked!

4857
06:01:22,390 --> 06:01:24,250
Wait, what are those birds?

4858
06:01:25,010 --> 06:01:25,850
See them birds?

4859
06:01:31,450 --> 06:01:33,410
I don't know how far over this guy comes.

4860
06:01:33,630 --> 06:01:35,310
Oh, okay, he stops.

4861
06:01:43,510 --> 06:01:44,670
I know I can just swim.

4862
06:01:45,730 --> 06:01:46,330
I'll just swim.

4863
06:01:46,630 --> 06:01:47,290
Oh, that's not swimming.

4864
06:01:51,750 --> 06:01:53,450
Oh, what a thrill.

4865
06:01:54,350 --> 06:01:55,070
Nope, that's not swimming.

4866
06:02:01,010 --> 06:02:02,490
thought we were going to kick off for real that time.

4867
06:02:03,110 --> 06:02:04,810
I thought it was Zunzo for us.

4868
06:02:07,090 --> 06:02:10,970
I'm searching for a crocodile.

4869
06:02:18,170 --> 06:02:19,430
I am crawling.

4870
06:02:21,690 --> 06:02:24,710
I think the water won't allow me for some reason.

4871
06:02:27,070 --> 06:02:27,590
There we go.

4872
06:02:32,090 --> 06:02:33,130
Chaff grenades.

4873
06:02:34,690 --> 06:02:35,930
Take those for sure.

4874
06:02:37,650 --> 06:02:40,090
Oh, what a thrill.

4875
06:02:57,440 --> 06:02:58,680
Just a crack.

4876
06:03:02,180 --> 06:03:04,940
Wow, it's really cool seeing the game.

4877
06:03:05,640 --> 06:03:07,360
Like, oh, whoops, I didn't mean to swim again.

4878
06:03:07,980 --> 06:03:11,520
Seeing everything, like, I could see underwater.

4879
06:03:11,760 --> 06:03:12,700
It's kind of insane.

4880
06:03:16,260 --> 06:03:18,940
There's something weird about that human-shaped crocodile.

4881
06:03:28,370 --> 06:03:30,110
I think we might need to kill people here.

4882
06:03:40,330 --> 06:03:41,130
Do you have any friends?

4883
06:03:43,550 --> 06:03:47,050
Because if so, everybody's sleeping with the fishes tonight.

4884
06:03:50,850 --> 06:03:51,770
There's your friend.

4885
06:03:59,290 --> 06:04:00,450
Oh, I forgot I got more.

4886
06:04:02,130 --> 06:04:03,910
I was like, wait, I can't waste my bullets.

4887
06:04:05,690 --> 06:04:06,210
No, no.

4888
06:04:06,850 --> 06:04:07,070
Oh!

4889
06:04:08,290 --> 06:04:08,810
Oh!

4890
06:04:11,740 --> 06:04:16,700
It's so satisfying watching them go down now.

4891
06:04:21,530 --> 06:04:22,670
Oh, oh no no no.

4892
06:04:23,290 --> 06:04:26,970
Upsies, upies, upies, upies, snake, upies.

4893
06:04:27,230 --> 06:04:29,250
Snake asks for upies, there we go.

4894
06:04:31,810 --> 06:04:38,390
Everybody's living with the fishes, but that's not me killing them.

4895
06:04:41,030 --> 06:04:41,470
Pick up.

4896
06:04:42,050 --> 06:04:42,590
Pick them up.

4897
06:04:43,130 --> 06:04:43,510
Hello?

4898
06:04:44,470 --> 06:04:45,230
Pick him up.

4899
06:04:47,770 --> 06:04:48,310
Snake.

4900
06:04:49,190 --> 06:04:50,950
What the hell are you doing, mister?

4901
06:04:54,250 --> 06:04:55,590
Pick him up.

4902
06:05:03,350 --> 06:05:03,890
Okay.

4903
06:05:05,290 --> 06:05:06,250
Oh, he's so gentle.

4904
06:05:06,470 --> 06:05:07,370
Oh, snake!

4905
06:05:09,290 --> 06:05:10,890
This is big old feet.

4906
06:05:13,550 --> 06:05:14,170
Oh my gosh.

4907
06:05:14,490 --> 06:05:15,050
Oh my gosh.

4908
06:05:15,170 --> 06:05:16,290
I can't even take this.

4909
06:05:17,150 --> 06:05:17,930
Okay, I give up.

4910
06:05:21,290 --> 06:05:22,630
How do I get in there?

4911
06:05:23,970 --> 06:05:24,430
Is that all?

4912
06:05:25,890 --> 06:05:26,830
Oh, oh, yeah.

4913
06:05:27,590 --> 06:05:28,190
More chaff.

4914
06:05:28,890 --> 06:05:29,450
Let's go?

4915
06:05:32,150 --> 06:05:33,030
Skull faces.

4916
06:05:33,670 --> 06:05:35,150
We don't want to think about what that guy's doing.

4917
06:05:38,530 --> 06:05:39,590
We don't think about him.

4918
06:05:40,730 --> 06:05:41,570
Suppressor, yeah.

4919
06:05:41,850 --> 06:05:42,290
Suppressor.

4920
06:05:46,330 --> 06:05:46,670
Wait.

4921
06:05:47,310 --> 06:05:48,030
Was this a...

4922
06:05:48,030 --> 06:05:48,170
Okay.

4923
06:05:49,210 --> 06:05:49,650
Yes!

4924
06:05:50,710 --> 06:05:55,470
We gotta get this if we want to maybe kill somebody in the next scene.

4925
06:06:01,190 --> 06:06:02,370
Uh-oh, Hungy?

4926
06:06:05,300 --> 06:06:06,280
Ah, we can leave.

4927
06:06:09,910 --> 06:06:11,170
I wish I...

4928
06:06:11,170 --> 06:06:11,910
Wait, what is that?

4929
06:06:12,850 --> 06:06:14,950
I wish I could ever tell what anything is.

4930
06:06:16,410 --> 06:06:18,590
So I can know before I waste my time.

4931
06:06:22,860 --> 06:06:23,180
Okay.

4932
06:06:24,180 --> 06:06:26,460
You're too slow, Snake, when you're just...

4933
06:06:27,240 --> 06:06:28,940
Stop stomping around!

4934
06:06:30,900 --> 06:06:31,900
Okay, I don't know.

4935
06:06:32,000 --> 06:06:32,420
We're hungry.

4936
06:06:32,620 --> 06:06:32,940
We're hungry.

4937
06:06:34,320 --> 06:06:35,940
I don't think I see anything over there.

4938
06:06:37,660 --> 06:06:39,520
Well, where are Gakko and Kero-Tan?

4939
06:06:39,960 --> 06:06:40,960
Actually, now I think about it.

4940
06:06:49,250 --> 06:06:50,690
Not so great.

4941
06:06:52,010 --> 06:06:53,250
Snake with the grippers.

4942
06:06:57,010 --> 06:06:57,610
Kero-Tan?

4943
06:06:59,750 --> 06:07:00,230
Gakko?

4944
06:07:00,310 --> 06:07:52,880
you've missed 260 kettle times maybe maybe I have no we haven't been through 260 areas shut up shut up actually does it say there's only 64 you've been to 259 areas oh I see when you go to a new area it automatically gives you that map prompt that's pretty nice actually luckily I know where we're going I

4945
06:07:56,940 --> 06:08:09,420
don't think he'll get catch shoot me over here and long nose croc is actually a species called a gareo and they are rarely a threat to large mammals yes I'm that guy.

4946
06:08:11,300 --> 06:08:13,300
Go to sleep as soon as stream starts.

4947
06:08:13,540 --> 06:08:14,120
Wake up for work.

4948
06:08:14,480 --> 06:08:15,260
Wonder how far Min got.

4949
06:08:15,640 --> 06:08:16,460
Seas are swimming around.

4950
06:08:16,680 --> 06:08:17,440
Dumbass cracks, dude.

4951
06:08:18,280 --> 06:08:18,920
Hell yeah.

4952
06:08:19,400 --> 06:08:20,400
Hell yeah.

4953
06:08:22,040 --> 06:08:22,520
Um.

4954
06:08:23,080 --> 06:08:24,360
Yeah, this is how we look.

4955
06:08:27,720 --> 06:08:28,680
Very cool.

4956
06:08:29,320 --> 06:08:31,720
But here's the real question.

4957
06:08:34,520 --> 06:08:35,880
We have a decision.

4958
06:08:37,360 --> 06:08:37,800
No.

4959
06:08:38,560 --> 06:08:40,220
Wait, I'm gonna say, okay, this is what I'm gonna do.

4960
06:08:40,340 --> 06:08:41,980
I'm gonna save, I'm gonna try.

4961
06:08:43,600 --> 06:08:47,000
And then, I will reload.

4962
06:08:51,630 --> 06:08:53,250
I say do it because you never do.

4963
06:08:53,390 --> 06:08:56,050
But I also wanna see the new fight, you know?

4964
06:08:57,770 --> 06:08:58,870
You want to save?

4965
06:08:59,610 --> 06:08:59,930
Yes.

4966
06:09:01,350 --> 06:09:02,710
So that's what we'll do.

4967
06:09:03,830 --> 06:09:05,770
Snake, have you heard of the last war?

4968
06:09:06,610 --> 06:09:08,110
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

4969
06:09:08,750 --> 06:09:38,850
It's a Japanese movie where the world ends a nuclear war tensions between east and west reach the breaking point and before anyone can stop it they launch the icbms humanity is wiped out by a war that no one wanted the movie depicts that destruction from the eyes of ordinary people their simple daily lives are torn apart by the terrible power of a war that has nothing to do with them everybody's afraid of the next big war but there's only so much i'm scared i've never sniped him before that's why the people

4970
06:09:46,880 --> 06:10:06,260
to sorry paramedic I was not paying attention to you I was snacking okay the crocodile body with the gun is kind of insane oh my gosh wait I hope someone pisses their pants

4971
06:10:13,580 --> 06:10:28,060
Tatiana I'm doing that right now.

4972
06:10:28,960 --> 06:10:30,240
Get your hands off me.

4973
06:10:30,800 --> 06:10:31,960
Seems like a fun time.

4974
06:10:39,010 --> 06:10:39,930
Really now?

4975
06:10:40,430 --> 06:10:42,130
How many times must I tell you?

4976
06:10:47,130 --> 06:10:48,050
Uh-huh.

4977
06:10:48,790 --> 06:10:50,810
My headphones just fell into my food.

4978
06:10:56,590 --> 06:11:00,010
Each time you resist, your lover will suffer the consequences.

4979
06:11:00,170 --> 06:11:00,910
Is that clear?

4980
06:11:01,250 --> 06:11:01,910
I think I'm okay.

4981
06:11:02,230 --> 06:11:02,810
I have a blanket.

4982
06:11:03,090 --> 06:11:03,570
Oh, not a blanket.

4983
06:11:03,750 --> 06:11:04,410
Oh, napkin.

4984
06:11:04,510 --> 06:11:06,270
We're fine.

4985
06:11:06,970 --> 06:11:07,750
Tatiana, are you okay, girl?

4986
06:11:09,150 --> 06:11:10,010
Damn you.

4987
06:11:11,790 --> 06:11:14,410
My chat froze on YouTube.

4988
06:11:16,950 --> 06:11:17,510
Holy cow.

4989
06:11:18,030 --> 06:11:18,740
Oh my god.

4990
06:11:34,510 --> 06:11:35,330
Vulcan!

4991
06:11:41,790 --> 06:11:42,230
Aw.

4992
06:11:45,050 --> 06:11:47,670
Hold it right there, traitor.

4993
06:11:49,330 --> 06:11:50,490
Gosh, I...

4994
06:11:50,490 --> 06:11:52,350
I love this part.

4995
06:12:00,310 --> 06:12:03,210
Let's find out just how lucky you are.

4996
06:12:03,670 --> 06:12:04,610
Lucky guy.

4997
06:12:06,530 --> 06:12:07,270
The Muggler.

4998
06:12:07,410 --> 06:12:08,190
Watch closely.

4999
06:12:19,550 --> 06:12:21,410
Oh my god.

5000
06:12:21,850 --> 06:12:24,410
One of these three guns has a single bullet in it.

5001
06:12:25,950 --> 06:12:28,650
I'm going to pull the trigger six times in a row.

5002
06:12:29,630 --> 06:12:30,090
Are you ready?

5003
06:12:32,730 --> 06:12:34,670
This is so crazy.

5004
06:12:55,860 --> 06:12:56,940
Every game.

5005
06:12:58,880 --> 06:13:00,540
Looks like your luck hasn't run out yet.

5006
06:13:01,000 --> 06:13:02,220
This is so steamy.

5007
06:13:04,800 --> 06:13:05,520
No!

5008
06:13:10,660 --> 06:13:11,980
She's so cool.

5009
06:13:13,180 --> 06:13:15,300
There's no such thing as luck on the battlefield.

5010
06:13:17,500 --> 06:13:18,000
You're smart.

5011
06:13:26,360 --> 06:13:28,760
I love laughing with Vulcan.

5012
06:13:33,860 --> 06:13:35,960
You'd better stay in line from now on.

5013
06:13:36,940 --> 06:13:37,320
Come on.

5014
06:13:37,440 --> 06:13:37,860
That's a lot.

5015
06:13:38,040 --> 06:13:38,520
Keep it together.

5016
06:13:38,920 --> 06:13:39,180
Mom.

5017
06:13:40,220 --> 06:13:40,700
Oh, please.

5018
06:13:40,720 --> 06:13:42,180
The Cobras will take care of him.

06:13:50,790 --> 06:13:52,710
He looks so shocked.

5022
06:13:55,930 --> 06:13:57,630
He's like, this is why I don't deal with women.

5023
06:13:59,170 --> 06:14:01,730

06:16:37,180 --> 06:16:39,580
Oh, I saw him for two seconds.

5039
06:16:40,060 --> 06:16:41,160
I went the wrong way.

5040
06:16:44,760 --> 06:16:46,060
Do you see him for two seconds?

5041
06:16:46,460 --> 06:16:46,980
All right, here we go.

5042
06:16:47,660 --> 06:16:48,380

5043
06:16:49,280 --> 06:16:49,820
I might miss.

5044
06:16:51,100 --> 06:16:51,820
I'm not gonna miss.

5045
06:16:54,160 --> 06:16:54,960
Wait, where is he?

5046
06:16:55,420 --> 06:16:55,560
Wait.

5047
06:16:56,680 --> 06:16:57,080
Where'd he go?

5048
06:16:57,120 --> 06:16:59,560

5049
06:16:59,760 --> 06:17:00,280
Oh, here we go.

5050
06:17:07,360 --> 06:17:07,680

Yeah!

5055
06:17:31,550 --> 06:17:33,230
One second, one second, one second.

5056
06:17:40,270 --> 06:17:41,570
Oh my gosh.

5057
06:17:45,160 --> 06:17:46,100
Okay, let's reload.

5058
06:17:46,940 --> 06:17:49,800
I'll obviously skip through the cutscene.

5059
06:17:51,660 --> 06:17:54,040
Wait, did it auto save before or after?

5060
06:17:56,400 --> 06:17:58,240
I know, he becomes really fast.

5061
06:18:02,490 --> 06:18:03,190
Like here?

5062
06:18:04,590 --> 06:18:06,450

5063
06:18:07,150 --> 06:18:08,410
What's, like, the angle?

5064
06:18:10,030 --> 06:18:11,070
So, let me turn it down.

5065
06:18:11,610 --> 06:18:13,150
Or, not angle, the...

5066
06:18:13,150 --> 06:18:15,610
You know, where I need to line up the sides.

5067
06:18:17,130 --> 06:18:18,050
A little too high.

5068
06:18:18,210 --> 06:18:18,350
Okay.

5069
06:18:18,990 --> 06:18:20,850
A little too high, a little too low.

5070
06:18:21,010 --> 06:18:21,710
Like here?

5071
06:18:23,230 --> 06:18:23,610

Ah, right!

5093
06:19:47,570 --> 06:19:49,890
Scrogg is pointing a gun at me.

5094
06:19:50,670 --> 06:19:52,130

Get out, get out.

06:21:27,820 --> 06:21:29,820

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5119
06:21:32,920 --> 06:21:35,340
I want the spiders to like me.

5120
06:21:36,060 --> 06:21:36,980
What was it?

5121
06:21:40,040 --> 06:21:40,260
Spiders!

5122
06:21:41,360 --> 06:21:42,320
Befriend me.

5123
06:21:42,580 --> 06:21:43,500
Oh, it's the hornets only.

5124
06:21:43,680 --> 06:21:46,120
I don't know why I thought the spiders would befriend me.

5125
06:21:48,140 --> 06:21:49,200
Well, we got Kedotan.

5126
06:21:49,420 --> 06:21:49,980
Where is Gakko?

5127
06:21:53,740 --> 06:21:54,900

06:21:55,080 --> 06:21:55,940
Come in.

5129
06:21:58,160 --> 06:21:59,420
Inside we go.

5130
06:22:04,770 --> 06:22:05,670
What else you got?

5131
06:22:06,710 --> 06:22:07,790
What else you got?

5132
06:22:08,450 --> 06:22:11,830
You know, I haven't tried getting any of the secret theater stuff.

5133
06:22:13,290 --> 06:22:15,350
Maybe we can hold up some guy at some point.

5134
06:22:16,750 --> 06:22:17,350
The warehouse.

5135
06:22:17,870 --> 06:22:17,870
Okay.

5136
06:22:24,150 --> 06:22:26,490
Whoa, it would be good camo here.

5137
06:22:29,210 --> 06:22:30,030

5138
06:22:30,030 --> 06:22:30,970
Oh, tiger strut.

5139
06:22:34,380 --> 06:22:36,720
Gold is negative 130.

5140
06:22:42,850 --> 06:22:43,890
A box?

5141
06:22:44,130 --> 06:22:44,970
Oh my gosh, wait.

5142
06:22:45,650 --> 06:22:46,590
You're so right.

5143
06:22:49,870 --> 06:23:09,150

5145
06:23:28,490 --> 06:23:31,330
oh I love being able to lay side by...

5146
06:23:31,330 --> 06:23:31,510
Oops.

06:23:32,250 --> 06:23:32,730
Oopsie.

5148
06:23:33,890 --> 06:23:34,730
Just kidding.

5149
06:23:40,040 --> 06:23:40,460
My being.

5150
06:23:42,280 --> 06:23:44,280
I mean, they're little whoopsie.

5151
06:23:53,170 --> 06:23:53,810
I can't...

5152
06:23:53,810 --> 06:23:54,290
Oh gosh.

5153
06:23:54,510 --> 06:23:56,310
Why does it feel like the boxes are bigger in this?

5154
06:24:07,260 --> 06:24:08,400
I think I got them.

5155
06:24:08,640 --> 06:24:08,900
Yeah.

5156
06:24:09,220 --> 06:24:12,380
That sound is like you getting them.

5157
06:24:13,780 --> 06:24:14,140
Right?

5158
06:24:16,360 --> 06:24:16,840
Right.

5159
06:24:20,040 --> 06:24:21,160
Did he fall?

5160
06:24:23,640 --> 06:24:25,160
Okay, I think there's only two guys in here.

5161
06:24:25,460 --> 06:24:27,060
Though, I honestly can't remember.

5162
06:24:28,100 --> 06:24:30,060
Oh, definitely more than two guys.

5163
06:24:30,700 --> 06:24:31,800
Okay, just kidding.

5164
06:24:33,500 --> 06:24:34,180
Kero-tan.

5165
06:24:34,420 --> 06:24:35,160
He's, like, glowing.

5166
06:24:35,560 --> 06:24:36,440
Wait, where is the other guy?

5167
06:24:37,020 --> 06:24:37,700
Oh, shoot.

5168
06:24:41,750 --> 06:24:42,590
Oh, my suppressor.

5169
06:24:44,570 --> 06:24:46,230
I forgot to put it in the next one.

5170
06:24:50,440 --> 06:24:52,490
I forgot to...

5171
06:25:14,540 --> 06:25:15,320
Easy.

5172
06:25:16,140 --> 06:25:16,300
See?

5173
06:25:17,020 --> 06:25:18,280
No problems here.

5174
06:25:22,480 --> 06:25:25,390
No problems here, everybody.

5175
06:25:27,730 --> 06:25:28,490
Nice shot, thank you.

5176
06:25:29,570 --> 06:25:30,570
Thank you very much.

5177
06:25:34,490 --> 06:25:35,430
Onwards.

5178
06:25:36,690 --> 06:25:38,490
Okay, so this is the one we have to fall.

5179
06:25:41,110 --> 06:25:42,150
Stealth 100?

5180
06:25:42,830 --> 06:25:43,450
Actually.

5181
06:25:44,390 --> 06:25:45,110
Okay.

5182
06:25:49,820 --> 06:25:51,300
Okay, and hang.

5183
06:25:54,360 --> 06:25:55,200
And...

5184
06:25:56,720 --> 06:25:57,980
And grab.

5185
06:26:00,260 --> 06:26:01,000
Thank you.

5186
06:26:01,920 --> 06:26:03,240
Definitely need that.

5187
06:26:06,420 --> 06:26:09,540
Onwards and upwards.

5188
06:26:14,670 --> 06:26:16,530
Oh, yeah, the good stuff.

5189
06:26:17,130 --> 06:26:18,890
Oh, yeah, the good stuff.

5190
06:26:19,750 --> 06:26:22,410
I could blow this up, but...

5191
06:26:22,430 --> 06:26:23,400
It's fine.

5192
06:26:25,290 --> 06:26:27,870
Have the guys be real hungry and sad.

5193
06:26:38,240 --> 06:26:39,020
No?

5194
06:26:41,480 --> 06:26:44,280
His bag shakes when he's walking up the stairs.

5195
06:26:44,860 --> 06:26:46,180
Where are you staring, eh?

5196
06:26:50,900 --> 06:26:52,180
Greninja Gorky.

5197
06:26:54,480 --> 06:26:55,580
Oh, no.

5198
06:26:59,350 --> 06:26:59,790
Oh.

5199
06:27:00,650 --> 06:27:02,090
My monitor does not like it.

5200
06:27:02,110 --> 06:27:02,770
this place.

5201
06:27:03,130 --> 06:27:04,910
It's like flickering a little bit.

5202
06:27:05,750 --> 06:27:10,130
Can't remember if there's only boobies traps in here or if there's also men.

5203
06:27:10,810 --> 06:27:15,290
I think there's no men right now and then they become boobies or become men later.

5204
06:27:16,290 --> 06:27:17,110
I can't remember.

5205
06:27:22,050 --> 06:27:27,050
I have a, well, I guess I'm, let's see.

5206
06:27:27,550 --> 06:27:27,550
Hmm.

5207
06:27:30,690 --> 06:27:31,530
Only boobies.

5208
06:27:32,090 --> 06:27:32,610
Okay, yeah.

5209
06:27:32,910 --> 06:27:35,550
So only Nice.

5210
06:27:36,830 --> 06:27:39,770
And then, and then there will be men later.

5211
06:27:40,970 --> 06:27:41,630
Little frog.

5212
06:27:46,650 --> 06:27:48,270
I can't see anything.

5213
06:27:48,490 --> 06:27:49,750
I wish I could full screen.

5214
06:27:50,790 --> 06:27:52,630
I wish I could full screen my game.

5215
06:27:53,890 --> 06:27:55,170
I'm sure they're pretty obvious.

5216
06:27:57,890 --> 06:27:58,510
Like that.

5217
06:27:59,910 --> 06:28:00,390
Oh, wait.

5218
06:28:01,990 --> 06:28:04,130
We got ourselves a sexy book.

5219
06:28:04,890 --> 06:28:05,630
Yes, we do.

5220
06:28:06,130 --> 06:28:08,310
Wait, I want to see also the Dead people!

5221
06:28:10,410 --> 06:28:10,790
Yeah!

5222
06:28:16,370 --> 06:28:17,410
Dead guy.

5223
06:28:19,350 --> 06:28:19,870
Ew.

5224
06:28:20,650 --> 06:28:22,970
I don't think he should be swaying that much.

5225
06:28:25,810 --> 06:28:29,550
I don't think he should be moving that much for someone who's dead.

5226
06:28:36,270 --> 06:28:37,290
Leca pinata.

5227
06:28:43,670 --> 06:28:44,830
Oh, that's a snake.

5228
06:28:47,710 --> 06:28:48,790
This is a snake.

5229
06:28:48,870 --> 06:28:49,690
That is a booby trap.

5230
06:28:51,010 --> 06:29:22,850
no climb I haven't done this at all I've been like I've been pretty bad about sneaking honestly I feel I haven't been so great about like utilizing things but it is what it is whoa and I did see Kero-Tan I saw him I saw him right there oh hungry Let's go,

5231
06:29:29,910 --> 06:29:34,910
let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let's some ramen.

5232
06:29:35,350 --> 06:29:36,710
Oh my gosh, bunny!

5233
06:29:38,250 --> 06:29:39,750
It's so cute!

5234
06:29:41,330 --> 06:29:42,530
Stand tall, bunny.

5235
06:29:44,130 --> 06:29:45,750
Wow, he's not afraid of me at all.

5236
06:29:46,250 --> 06:29:47,170
Just kidding, there he goes.

5237
06:29:48,490 --> 06:29:50,290
I see a bunny and he get hungry, huh?

5238
06:29:52,350 --> 06:29:54,130
Let's have a false mango.

5239
06:29:55,570 --> 06:29:56,050
Ah.

5240
06:29:57,310 --> 06:29:58,330
Pretty tasty.

5241
06:30:04,550 --> 06:30:05,950
We got lots of ink.

5242
06:30:06,070 --> 06:30:06,290
Oh.

5243
06:30:07,770 --> 06:30:09,070
Oh my gosh.

5244
06:30:09,530 --> 06:30:11,290
We got lots of ink caps in here.

5245
06:30:13,050 --> 06:30:15,490
I think I don't need to explore.

5246
06:30:16,190 --> 06:30:17,610
Okay, there's a trap right there.

5247
06:30:18,350 --> 06:30:19,190
This is a trap.

5248
06:30:20,870 --> 06:30:21,750
Watch out.

5249
06:30:22,950 --> 06:30:24,190
Watch your toes.

5250
06:30:26,210 --> 06:30:26,610
Okay.

5251
06:30:29,750 --> 06:30:31,570
I'm being extra cautious.

5252
06:30:37,630 --> 06:30:40,310
I was being extra cautious.

5253
06:30:46,230 --> 06:30:49,530
Why is suddenly Gakko so hard to find?

5254
06:30:50,830 --> 06:30:51,170
Wait.

5255
06:30:53,810 --> 06:30:55,110
I think those are boobokos.

5256
06:30:56,670 --> 06:30:58,550
I thought they were hornet's nests.

5257
06:30:59,790 --> 06:30:59,890
Wait.

5258
06:31:00,390 --> 06:31:01,090
I see.

5259
06:31:01,250 --> 06:31:02,610
I spy with my little eyes.

5260
06:31:02,630 --> 06:31:33,170
something yellow where is he I just saw him you guys saw him too right game looks so good it honestly it plays really well it's really fun like it's it's great I'm really happy like any complaints that I would have

5261
06:31:36,510 --> 06:31:39,510
Or, like, it doesn't even matter, I feel.

5262
06:31:39,670 --> 06:31:41,050
I'm having so much fun.

5263
06:31:43,290 --> 06:31:44,770
Where the hell is this guy?

5264
06:31:46,450 --> 06:31:48,150
I saw him!

5265
06:31:55,350 --> 06:31:56,430
Maybe from...

5266
06:31:56,430 --> 06:31:56,990
A ribbit?

5267
06:31:58,830 --> 06:31:59,430
Wait, can I...

5268
06:31:59,430 --> 06:32:00,610
This is just making noise, right?

5269
06:32:02,570 --> 06:32:03,110
Ah.

5270
06:32:03,370 --> 06:32:03,970
Oh well.

5271
06:32:07,750 --> 06:32:09,210
I could see him from here.

5272
06:32:09,310 --> 06:32:09,750
Hold on.

5273
06:32:09,930 --> 06:32:10,570
Oh, there he is.

5274
06:32:10,970 --> 06:32:11,210
See?

5275
06:32:11,310 --> 06:32:12,730
See, Gakko right there.

5276
06:32:13,690 --> 06:32:15,290
Maybe I can get him with my...

5277
06:32:22,000 --> 06:32:22,420
Yubi!

5278
06:32:22,700 --> 06:32:24,280
Okay, we got both for this area.

5279
06:32:32,590 --> 06:32:32,910
Ah!

5280
06:32:33,490 --> 06:32:33,930
I'm

5281
06:32:43,260 --> 06:32:44,360
an alligator here.

5282
06:32:44,480 --> 06:32:45,180
It'll work.

5283
06:32:47,080 --> 06:32:48,860
Oh, I forgot about the dogs here.

5284
06:32:55,950 --> 06:32:57,870
That was some pretty fancy shooting.

5285
06:32:58,310 --> 06:32:59,470
You're pretty good.

5286
06:33:01,050 --> 06:33:02,990
It really does sound like hot dog.

5287
06:33:04,110 --> 06:33:06,610
Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

5288
06:33:17,800 --> 06:33:20,760
What did the animal one give me again?

5289
06:33:22,300 --> 06:33:23,380
Oh, wait, no, I don't remember.

5290
06:33:24,680 --> 06:33:25,800
Oh, handshake.

5291
06:33:33,050 --> 06:33:34,890
Sorry, I thought my cat snuck in here.

5292
06:33:36,670 --> 06:33:37,450
Let's see.

5293
06:33:41,210 --> 06:33:42,690
A little change, though.

5294
06:33:45,130 --> 06:33:45,310
Naked!

5295
06:33:45,930 --> 06:33:47,730
Naked woodland is...

5296
06:33:47,730 --> 06:33:48,490
Plus 30?

5297
06:33:51,350 --> 06:33:52,230
No way!

5298
06:33:52,610 --> 06:33:54,510
They just want me to be naked.

5299
06:33:56,230 --> 06:33:57,830
They just want me to be naked.

5300
06:33:58,410 --> 06:33:59,350
Oh, I have the woodland on.

5301
06:34:00,990 --> 06:34:02,830
I want to see my body.

5302
06:34:03,810 --> 06:34:04,470
For science.

5303
06:34:07,450 --> 06:34:08,330
Where are...

5304
06:34:08,330 --> 06:34:09,090
Where...

5305
06:34:09,090 --> 06:34:09,510
Oh, wait.

5306
06:34:09,570 --> 06:34:10,730
See, there's a scratch there.

5307
06:34:12,390 --> 06:34:15,290
I want to get beat up without dying.

5308
06:34:15,490 --> 06:34:15,890
And see what...

5309
06:34:15,890 --> 06:34:17,210
Oh, there's a scratch on my arm?

5310
06:34:18,310 --> 06:34:21,450
I want to get beat the hell up.

5311
06:34:22,290 --> 06:34:22,790
Punch me.

5312
06:34:23,470 --> 06:34:24,310
Punch me right now.

5313
06:34:26,330 --> 06:34:27,390
Punch me right now.

5314
06:34:28,870 --> 06:34:29,490
Look at his hair.

5315
06:34:29,630 --> 06:34:30,570
It's so fluffy.

5316
06:34:30,990 --> 06:34:32,270
Oh my gosh, look at his hair.

5317
06:34:38,210 --> 06:34:40,330
A scar on his face, too.

5318
06:34:48,100 --> 06:34:48,760
Spin him.

5319
06:34:48,940 --> 06:34:49,420
You're right.

5320
06:34:50,060 --> 06:34:50,720
It's time.

5321
06:34:51,200 --> 06:34:52,940
It's time to spin our baby boy.

5322
06:34:54,380 --> 06:34:54,520
Oh.

5323
06:34:57,750 --> 06:34:58,990
Go, Rambo, go.

5324
06:34:59,510 --> 06:35:00,310
Spin.

5325
06:35:02,770 --> 06:35:03,350
It's time.

5326
06:35:04,470 --> 06:35:05,310
It's time.

5327
06:35:07,290 --> 06:35:08,770
It's time.

5328
06:35:14,000 --> 06:35:15,800
Ralph called.

5329
06:35:15,980 --> 06:35:17,520
Make Snake throw up.

5330
06:35:18,080 --> 06:35:18,940
It's an achievement.

5331
06:35:20,800 --> 06:35:21,880
It's an achievement.

5332
06:35:23,860 --> 06:35:24,570
Oh, come on.

5333
06:35:30,130 --> 06:35:32,250
They want you to make him throw up.

5334
06:35:34,890 --> 06:35:36,370
Yeah, you're stupid.

5335
06:35:39,770 --> 06:35:41,690
What if he fell onto the...

5336
06:35:41,690 --> 06:35:41,870
Oh!

5337
06:36:11,140 --> 06:36:12,300
No, no, dog.

5338
06:36:12,980 --> 06:36:14,120
Stop moving so fast.

5339
06:36:16,400 --> 06:36:17,280
Dog, stop moving.

5340
06:36:18,520 --> 06:36:18,560
Dog.

5341
06:36:19,240 --> 06:36:20,300
Dog, stop moving.

5342
06:36:25,640 --> 06:36:26,200
Wait.

5343
06:36:26,560 --> 06:36:27,180
The dog's down?

5344
06:36:28,640 --> 06:36:29,200
Yes.

5345
06:36:38,150 --> 06:36:39,530
Oh, where are I going to get you from?

5346
06:36:39,930 --> 06:36:40,210
There.

5347
06:36:41,930 --> 06:36:42,910
There we go.

5348
06:36:44,590 --> 06:36:44,950
Okie dokie.

5349
06:36:48,770 --> 06:36:50,610
We'll crawl in over here.

5350
06:36:52,010 --> 06:36:53,070
Dog is down.

5351
06:37:00,080 --> 06:37:01,520
One moment, hold on.

5352
06:37:02,900 --> 06:37:04,200
I'm being secret.

5353
06:37:05,320 --> 06:37:07,060
Is this the one with the hole over here?

5354
06:37:08,040 --> 06:37:08,460
Yes.

5355
06:37:16,400 --> 06:37:18,540
Granini Gorky Lab exterior.

5356
06:37:20,860 --> 06:37:23,160
Oh, that's a guy like right next to me.

5357
06:37:29,190 --> 06:37:29,810
I can't see.

5358
06:37:30,490 --> 06:37:31,830
The grass is too thick.

5359
06:37:35,550 --> 06:37:36,470
I get him though.

5360
06:37:37,410 --> 06:37:38,150
Those friend notice.

5361
06:37:40,810 --> 06:37:41,510
What's wrong?

5362
06:37:43,350 --> 06:37:43,990
What's wrong?

5363
06:37:46,410 --> 06:37:46,790
Hello?

5364
06:37:47,370 --> 06:37:48,130
I don't know.

5365
06:37:48,190 --> 06:37:49,970
The way they say it in this game is so funny.

5366
06:37:51,690 --> 06:37:52,970
Oh, I'm hungry.

5367
06:38:00,650 --> 06:38:02,010
Reticulated python.

5368
06:38:03,910 --> 06:38:05,650
Nice shot, thank you.

5369
06:38:07,790 --> 06:38:08,790
That's tasty.

5370
06:38:11,330 --> 06:38:14,390
I can't stop quoting snake whenever I eat something good now.

5371
06:38:14,870 --> 06:38:23,150
The way that this series has absolutely, like, completely altered my brain chemistry is kind of scary.

5372
06:38:24,070 --> 06:38:25,970
It's kind of scary how much I'm, like...

5373
06:38:25,990 --> 06:38:44,410
always quoting stuff now and just like I I can't stop I legitimately just have become a become broke brain from this from the series twas

5374
06:38:49,610 --> 06:38:55,370
fate I should have thrown him a frog I think I got him though

5375
06:39:04,330 --> 06:39:07,250
what was back here

5376
06:39:13,470 --> 06:39:14,270
More stuff.

5377
06:39:17,790 --> 06:39:18,010
Oh.

5378
06:39:21,590 --> 06:39:22,630
Which way do I want to go?

5379
06:39:22,710 --> 06:39:24,930
I think, actually, Kero-Tan is...

5380
06:39:24,930 --> 06:39:27,510
If they kept Kero-Tan in the same place...

5381
06:39:28,830 --> 06:39:31,790
Okay, I do know that there's also...

5382
06:39:32,530 --> 06:39:33,790
The storage over there.

5383
06:39:33,890 --> 06:39:35,450
Yes, Kero-Tan is still in the same place.

5384
06:39:45,310 --> 06:39:46,030
What's this?

5385
06:39:48,890 --> 06:39:49,290
XM...

5386
06:39:50,770 --> 06:39:51,490
16E1.

5387
06:39:53,210 --> 06:39:53,930
Fancy.

5388
06:39:59,270 --> 06:40:05,970
Giving me a whole lot of stuff for me and my no-kill run.

5389
06:40:09,130 --> 06:40:13,170
I guess we'll just go in through the front door.

5390
06:40:13,950 --> 06:40:15,510
Akero time's there, but how...

5391
06:40:18,030 --> 06:40:19,190
Also, how...

5392
06:40:19,190 --> 06:40:20,950
Where Gakko and also how get...

5393
06:40:20,970 --> 06:40:23,010
Can I shoot through the window?

5394
06:40:26,160 --> 06:40:27,640
I don't remember how.

5395
06:40:29,460 --> 06:40:29,700
Yep.

5396
06:40:31,200 --> 06:40:31,420
Thank you.

5397
06:40:31,700 --> 06:40:33,220
And we put on our suit.

5398
06:40:37,440 --> 06:40:40,040
Time to become a scientist.

5399
06:40:43,360 --> 06:40:43,560
Oh!

5400
06:40:45,400 --> 06:40:46,840
Wait, double glasses.

5401
06:40:47,040 --> 06:40:47,460
Never mind.

5402
06:40:48,480 --> 06:40:50,440
Wait, bigger, nerdier glasses.

5403
06:40:51,580 --> 06:40:51,960
Which one?

5404
06:40:52,060 --> 06:40:54,180
Okay, which one do you guys think are the nerdier glasses?

5405
06:40:54,380 --> 06:40:57,100
These glasses or these glasses?

5406
06:40:58,140 --> 06:40:59,820
Which one are the nerdier glasses?

5407
06:41:01,200 --> 06:41:02,960
One or two?

5408
06:41:04,720 --> 06:41:06,340
No kill run, Minto, you just electrocuted.

5409
06:41:06,520 --> 06:41:09,380
I didn't electrocute him, he shouldn't have fallen onto the fence!

5410
06:41:10,260 --> 06:41:10,660
Two?

5411
06:41:12,760 --> 06:41:14,740
Since they are new, we'll try those.

5412
06:41:14,980 --> 06:41:15,880
We'll try the new ones.

5413
06:41:17,320 --> 06:41:18,880
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

5414
06:41:19,520 --> 06:41:19,860
Wiggle, wiggle.

5415
06:41:26,570 --> 06:41:28,110
I'm in Grenini Gorky.

5416
06:41:29,810 --> 06:41:31,390
And I am a scientist.

5417
06:41:35,030 --> 06:41:36,830
I am a scientist.

5418
06:41:42,770 --> 06:41:43,330
I...

5419
06:41:43,330 --> 06:41:44,750
Okay, this is for science.

5420
06:41:44,990 --> 06:41:46,850
If I run...

5421
06:41:46,850 --> 06:41:47,670
Okay, they don't care.

5422
06:41:48,670 --> 06:41:51,230
If I go in there, I might get caught.

5423
06:41:51,710 --> 06:41:52,850
Just don't touch them.

5424
06:41:54,950 --> 06:41:56,430
Don't act suspicious.

5425
06:41:57,110 --> 06:41:57,910
If I crouch...

5426
06:41:58,990 --> 06:41:59,950
He doesn't care.

5427
06:42:02,270 --> 06:42:04,230
That guy looks like Otakon for real.

5428
06:42:08,970 --> 06:42:10,770
I heard Keto Tan go on Marko Wiggle.

5429
06:42:11,370 --> 06:42:13,650
I want to see the sexy lady over here.

5430
06:42:15,990 --> 06:42:16,470
Oh, I see her.

5431
06:42:16,550 --> 06:42:16,970
You see her?

5432
06:42:18,670 --> 06:42:19,850
These guys are...

5433
06:42:19,850 --> 06:42:20,650
Oh, that's...

5434
06:42:20,650 --> 06:42:22,010
Ah, hey, hey.

5435
06:42:22,870 --> 06:42:23,790
It's so funny.

5436
06:42:24,190 --> 06:42:26,590
The scientists have, like, 2020 vision crazy.

5437
06:42:30,980 --> 06:42:33,840
Like, they'll see you walking by and they'll be like, Um, who that?

5438
06:42:35,240 --> 06:42:36,740
Um, I don't recognize that guy.

5439
06:42:38,660 --> 06:42:40,060
It's so annoying.

5440
06:42:44,640 --> 06:42:45,520
They kept it.

5441
06:43:08,850 --> 06:43:10,210
I missed.

5442
06:43:11,450 --> 06:43:12,930
I missed just a bit.

5443
06:43:20,290 --> 06:43:21,050
One more try.

5444
06:43:23,950 --> 06:43:24,550
There we go.

5445
06:43:25,690 --> 06:43:27,550
I heard the sound.

5446
06:43:29,630 --> 06:43:30,970
I heard it.

5447
06:43:31,450 --> 06:43:32,870
Oh my gosh, she looks so serious.

5448
06:43:40,220 --> 06:43:42,640
There's nothing, not that much in the background.

5449
06:43:44,380 --> 06:43:44,960
Whoa.

5450
06:43:46,560 --> 06:43:47,400
Oh yeah.

5451
06:43:48,020 --> 06:43:48,620
Oh yeah.

5452
06:43:49,900 --> 06:43:50,480
Okay.

5453
06:43:51,500 --> 06:43:54,960
I can't wait to play this game again and just do photo mode everywhere.

5454
06:43:56,700 --> 06:43:58,840
I can't wait to do so much photo mode.

5455
06:44:02,530 --> 06:44:03,110
Yay!

5456
06:44:06,430 --> 06:44:33,230

5457
06:44:38,870 --> 06:44:40,810
pictures in every place.

5458
06:44:45,780 --> 06:44:47,100
Is anybody in here?

5459
06:44:50,200 --> 06:44:50,760
Nice.

5460
06:44:51,280 --> 06:44:52,840
Getting lots of suppressors all of a sudden.

5461
06:44:53,060 --> 06:44:53,520
It's awesome.

5462
06:45:02,310 --> 06:45:03,190
Okay, I'm trapped.

5463
06:45:05,670 --> 06:45:06,610
Are there ghost photos?

5464
06:45:06,870 --> 06:45:10,010
No, there are no ghost photos in MGS3.

5465
06:45:11,110 --> 06:45:11,670
Unfortunately.

5466
06:45:14,950 --> 06:45:15,790
What's here?

5467
06:45:16,950 --> 06:45:17,130
What's here?

5468
06:45:17,150 --> 06:45:17,850
Honestly, the balcony?

5469
06:45:18,010 --> 06:45:18,190
Yeah.

5470
06:45:18,450 --> 06:45:18,530
Oh.

5471
06:45:19,170 --> 06:45:20,530
I didn't mean to go through.

5472
06:45:24,450 --> 06:45:25,650
Well, we got our chocolate chip!

5473
06:45:26,230 --> 06:45:27,150
Wait, that's a fun...

5474
06:45:27,150 --> 06:45:29,400
That's a fun codec call, too.

5475
06:45:34,040 --> 06:45:35,460
Ghost bottom, right?

5476
06:45:40,750 --> 06:45:42,150
Any of the ladies in here?

5477
06:45:50,400 --> 06:45:52,760
I'm not gonna think I'm weird for going inside, are there?

5478
06:45:54,560 --> 06:45:55,040
Can't see?

5479
06:46:00,380 --> 06:46:01,700
Dr. Bandana.

5480
06:46:02,540 --> 06:46:06,500
Oh, we have a beautiful picturesque painting.

5481
06:46:08,200 --> 06:46:08,560
Oh, hello.

5482
06:46:10,340 --> 06:46:11,520
Are you coming over here or?

5483
06:46:12,500 --> 06:46:18,700
I'm doing, I'm conducting very legitimate science.

5484
06:46:20,500 --> 06:46:20,720
Hello?

5485
06:46:25,050 --> 06:46:25,770
Okay.

5486
06:46:32,720 --> 06:46:34,600
I'm doing research on...

5487
06:46:35,200 --> 06:46:36,420
Okay, my goodness!

5488
06:46:36,420 --> 06:46:40,900
Oh, that's the thing that is alive.

5489
06:46:42,300 --> 06:46:43,680
Instant noodles.

5490
06:46:44,960 --> 06:46:45,840
I don't want to...

5491
06:46:45,840 --> 06:46:47,200
We'll eat the red.

5492
06:46:48,200 --> 06:46:49,120
Hmm.

5493
06:46:51,580 --> 06:46:52,040
Hmm.

5494
06:46:52,480 --> 06:46:52,900
Yeah.

5495
06:46:53,340 --> 06:46:53,560
Hmm.

5496
06:46:53,720 --> 06:46:54,120
Indeed.

5497
06:46:55,160 --> 06:46:55,740
Alright.

5498
06:46:56,440 --> 06:46:57,420
What's in here?

5499
06:46:58,340 --> 06:46:58,580
Oh.

5500
06:46:58,940 --> 06:46:59,480
Body.

5501
06:47:02,280 --> 06:47:02,740
Hello?

5502
06:47:05,480 --> 06:47:06,400
Hello?

5503
06:47:06,420 --> 06:47:09,820
I guess this is a few, you know, is there people who are not

5504
06:47:13,400 --> 06:47:16,700
who are not going to play with the scientist outfit?

5505
06:47:18,400 --> 06:47:19,440
And we'll...

5506
06:47:19,440 --> 06:47:21,760
Oh, there's spiders in the wall in here!

5507
06:47:24,580 --> 06:47:25,100
Nasty!

5508
06:47:31,450 --> 06:47:33,270
Um, is there anything over here?

5509
06:47:35,230 --> 06:47:36,570
Excuse me, can I sleep?

5510
06:47:37,010 --> 06:47:37,750
Sneak past you?

5511
06:47:37,770 --> 06:47:38,250
There you go.

5512
06:47:40,650 --> 06:47:41,170
Okay.

5513
06:47:42,030 --> 06:47:42,950
What's in here?

5514
06:47:43,610 --> 06:47:44,410
Oh, storage.

5515
06:47:44,610 --> 06:47:45,670
Oh, nice.

5516
06:47:46,190 --> 06:47:47,330
Yes, I remember this.

5517
06:47:47,430 --> 06:47:47,670
Okay.

5518
06:47:48,230 --> 06:47:49,270
I think there's something.

5519
06:47:49,550 --> 06:47:49,710
Nope.

5520
06:47:50,170 --> 06:47:51,390
I thought there was something on top.

5521
06:47:51,750 --> 06:47:52,890
No, I'm thinking of another building.

5522
06:47:57,450 --> 06:47:58,270
What's here?

5523
06:48:02,190 --> 06:48:03,010
Dirty book.

5524
06:48:05,930 --> 06:48:07,050
Someone's, uh...

5525
06:48:07,050 --> 06:48:08,670
Someone's stash.

5526
06:48:09,070 --> 06:48:09,870
Alright, cool.

5527
06:48:10,190 --> 06:48:11,070
Now we can go downstairs.

5528
06:48:15,050 --> 06:48:15,750
I heard!

5529
06:48:17,010 --> 06:48:18,170
I heard Gakko.

5530
06:48:18,250 --> 06:48:19,130
I heard.

5531
06:48:19,390 --> 06:48:19,950
Hi, Dad.

5532
06:48:20,890 --> 06:48:21,410
I heard it.

5533
06:48:21,530 --> 06:48:22,330
I heard it.

5534
06:48:24,350 --> 06:48:28,650
Also, my room is now so much cooler in case anyone's wondering.

5535
06:48:29,550 --> 06:48:30,270
How long am I even streaming?

5536
06:48:30,390 --> 06:48:31,130
Almost seven hours.

5537
06:48:31,370 --> 06:48:31,710
Why am I?

5538
06:48:34,890 --> 06:48:36,050
I hear him.

5539
06:48:39,840 --> 06:48:41,080
Like, it's trying to...

5540
06:48:41,080 --> 06:48:43,220
What do you think you're doing?

5541
06:48:43,260 --> 06:48:43,500
Sorry.

5542
06:48:44,580 --> 06:48:44,980
I'm running.

5543
06:48:46,940 --> 06:48:48,740
You can hear that they give you hints.

5544
06:48:49,160 --> 06:48:49,740
It's kind of funny.

5545
06:48:54,230 --> 06:48:56,610
It doesn't feel like seven hours, though.

5546
06:48:57,750 --> 06:48:58,630
It feels...

5547
06:48:58,630 --> 06:49:02,250
It feels way less.

5548
06:49:13,510 --> 06:49:15,070
I hear him.

5549
06:49:15,850 --> 06:49:16,690
Giving me hints.

5550
06:49:20,640 --> 06:49:22,060
Ew, there's spiders on the...

5551
06:49:22,060 --> 06:49:22,600
Ouch!

5552
06:49:23,240 --> 06:49:24,680
Are you kidding me?

5553
06:49:25,560 --> 06:49:26,960
As soon as I said something?

5554
06:49:27,920 --> 06:49:30,520
I hate this.

5555
06:49:30,860 --> 06:49:32,500
I'm suffering from venom poison.

5556
06:49:32,560 --> 06:49:33,520
This is me when I play.

5557
06:49:34,380 --> 06:49:36,920
I'm suffering for venom poisoning.

5558
06:49:38,500 --> 06:49:38,580
No!

5559
06:49:44,880 --> 06:49:45,870
Don't touch me.

5560
06:49:55,360 --> 06:49:56,980
I'm a doctor and I love to role play.

5561
06:49:57,240 --> 06:49:57,720
I'm in jail.

5562
06:49:58,340 --> 06:49:59,320
Is there anything under there?

5563
06:50:00,700 --> 06:50:01,000
Oh.

5564
06:50:01,800 --> 06:50:04,080
Is that the way we need to crawl?

5565
06:50:06,560 --> 06:50:07,060
Hello.

5566
06:50:07,580 --> 06:50:08,540
Watch out for those spies.

5567
06:50:52,620 --> 06:50:55,140
If I were a mouse...

5568
06:50:55,160 --> 06:50:58,160
I would get caught in your trap any day, Miss Haruna Yabuki.

5569
06:51:02,000 --> 06:51:02,560
Oh!

5570
06:51:02,880 --> 06:51:03,240
Sorry.

5571
06:51:06,180 --> 06:51:07,080
You don't notice anything.

5572
06:51:08,420 --> 06:51:09,320
I didn't mean to press that.

5573
06:51:12,520 --> 06:51:14,100
I got really excited about her.

5574
06:51:16,940 --> 06:51:17,500
Oh.

5575
06:51:18,040 --> 06:51:18,560
Yeah?

5576
06:51:20,280 --> 06:51:21,040
Oh, no.

5577
06:51:21,540 --> 06:51:21,980
Oh, no.

5578
06:51:22,140 --> 06:51:23,360
He looks really stupid.

5579
06:51:38,340 --> 06:51:40,240
I did the horny front flip.

5580
06:51:43,340 --> 06:51:49,160
Should I change and then seek you see him?

5581
06:51:49,620 --> 06:51:50,060
I think so.

5582
06:51:53,500 --> 06:51:54,680
Oh shit, he healed.

5583
06:52:11,240 --> 06:52:12,880
Miss Yabuki, save me!

5584
06:52:15,000 --> 06:52:16,300
We're fine.

5585
06:52:37,070 --> 06:52:38,590
They have no idea.

5586
06:52:46,460 --> 06:52:47,340
What's wrong?

5587
06:52:51,360 --> 06:52:51,980
What's wrong?

5588
06:52:53,400 --> 06:52:54,720
Oh, gosh, they're going to hear my tummy.

5589
06:52:56,640 --> 06:52:57,060
What's wrong?

5590
06:52:58,580 --> 06:53:00,360
I love caution music.

5591
06:53:09,610 --> 06:53:12,210
I actually don't remember how I'm supposed to get over there.

5592
06:53:14,210 --> 06:53:45,650
long timer oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I don't remember Karina Yabuki has 20k followers on Instagram you looked her up so bad you were like you you saw a prize and he went for it we did get a lot of good nutritional things but I don't let my tummy get down a little bit further.

5593
06:53:52,250 --> 06:54:00,030
I'm glad that they are still too stupid to look under the bed.

5594
06:54:01,070 --> 06:54:03,710
Prize on the eyes, me too.

5595
06:54:06,630 --> 06:54:07,790
So true, mig.

5596
06:54:14,200 --> 06:54:15,160
He's moonwalking.

5597
06:54:17,880 --> 06:54:21,240
Guys, I can't remember how to get it over to I almost said AIMS again.

5598
06:54:21,360 --> 06:54:21,940
Oh my gosh.

5599
06:54:22,080 --> 06:54:23,780
Because he says, you must be Sokolov.

5600
06:54:24,280 --> 06:54:26,360
I always want to say, you must be AIMS.

5601
06:54:27,980 --> 06:54:29,480
I want to say that all the time.

5602
06:54:29,920 --> 06:54:31,160
You must be AIMS.

5603
06:54:54,590 --> 06:54:54,990
Nah.

5604
06:54:55,330 --> 06:54:56,390
One of the other models later.

5605
06:54:57,190 --> 06:54:58,610
He has a hundred K followers?

5606
06:54:58,770 --> 06:54:59,250
Holy cow.

5607
06:55:01,710 --> 06:55:02,910
I'm eating some rice.

5608
06:55:03,690 --> 06:55:05,070
I heated up earlier.

5609
06:55:06,530 --> 06:55:06,930
Okay.

5610
06:55:08,550 --> 06:55:09,670
Rice and chicken.

5611
06:55:15,990 --> 06:55:17,990
Yes, yes.

5612
06:55:24,410 --> 06:55:28,310
You ever giggle to yourself when you say a Kojima trigger word and we all say the thing?

5613
06:55:29,950 --> 06:55:31,410
I don't giggle to myself.

5614
06:55:31,690 --> 06:55:32,790
I giggle out loud.

5615
06:55:37,860 --> 06:55:43,040
I love when you guys enable me.

5616
06:55:52,500 --> 06:55:53,440
Guys, I don't remember

5617
06:55:59,430 --> 06:56:02,210
Guys, I don't remember how to get to Sokolov.

5618
06:56:04,710 --> 06:56:05,310
I can't remember.

5619
06:56:14,870 --> 06:56:15,870
I can't remember.

5620
06:56:20,450 --> 06:56:21,930
The nerd lab.

5621
06:56:26,420 --> 06:56:30,720
Hello, I'm the scientist that you saw earlier and thought nothing strange about.

5622
06:56:35,750 --> 06:56:37,050
Wait, is the guy still in there?

5623
06:56:37,350 --> 06:56:38,130
Or did he come out?

5624
06:56:42,270 --> 06:56:43,930
Sorry, I'm so hungry.

5625
06:56:43,950 --> 06:56:45,250
They don't feed us here.

5626
06:56:46,610 --> 06:56:48,030
Wait, what is this?

5627
06:56:50,330 --> 06:56:51,670
Oh, cute!

5628
06:56:55,450 --> 06:56:57,070
Wow, they kept those.

5629
06:56:59,110 --> 06:56:59,330
Oh!

5630
06:57:00,710 --> 06:57:01,030
Run.

5631
06:57:01,710 --> 06:57:01,970
Run.

5632
06:57:03,190 --> 06:57:03,510
Ah!

5633
06:57:06,960 --> 06:57:08,380
This is so unfair.

5634
06:57:11,810 --> 06:57:13,670
This is so unfair!

5635
06:57:17,960 --> 06:57:19,900
I'm an innocent little scientist!

5636
06:57:20,820 --> 06:57:21,100
No!

5637
06:57:27,490 --> 06:57:28,830
Oh, I just...

5638
06:57:28,950 --> 06:57:31,190
Got through caution, please!

5639
06:57:33,210 --> 06:57:33,550
No!

5640
06:57:34,890 --> 06:57:36,130
Are you gonna look?

5641
06:57:40,470 --> 06:57:42,470
I'm gonna throw a snake at you.

5642
06:57:50,350 --> 06:57:51,030
Uh...

5643
06:57:51,030 --> 06:57:52,230
Where was my snake?

5644
06:57:56,770 --> 06:57:58,550
Oh wait, we can throw a frog.

5645
06:57:59,510 --> 06:58:01,470
Throw a frog sea at them.

5646
06:58:02,810 --> 06:58:04,930
Did you hear that noise?

5647
06:58:10,350 --> 06:58:11,030
Yeah!

5648
06:58:12,010 --> 06:58:12,410
Ah.

5649
06:58:16,040 --> 06:58:17,080
Nothing here.

5650
06:58:19,280 --> 06:58:21,640
I'm gonna throw frogs so you have them again.

5651
06:58:22,600 --> 06:58:23,740
Wait, where'd it go?

5652
06:58:24,080 --> 06:58:25,640
Oh, it's not in my inventory anymore, huh?

5653
06:58:26,740 --> 06:58:27,940
Gotta put it back on my backpack.

5654
06:58:31,850 --> 06:58:33,010
Poison dart frog!

5655
06:58:40,340 --> 06:58:40,920
No!

5656
06:58:41,480 --> 06:58:43,440
Did you hear that noise?

5657
06:58:45,840 --> 06:58:46,640
Eat up!

5658
06:58:49,620 --> 06:58:51,540
Oh, I'm so annoyed.

5659
06:58:51,720 --> 06:58:53,080
I don't want to wait all the way for caution.

5660
06:58:53,340 --> 06:58:54,200
I almost want to restart.

5661
06:58:54,420 --> 06:58:56,420
Wait, if I load...

5662
06:58:59,300 --> 06:59:01,040
Oh, I didn't...

5663
06:59:01,040 --> 06:59:01,040
Ugh.

5664
06:59:03,940 --> 06:59:04,600
Never mind.

5665
06:59:06,060 --> 06:59:06,840
Nothing here.

5666
06:59:08,240 --> 06:59:09,280
Please leave.

5667
06:59:12,500 --> 06:59:15,860
I got... I was... I didn't... I didn't see him!

5668
06:59:20,860 --> 06:59:25,420
I was doing so well, kind of, well, you know, I didn't...

5669
06:59:26,120 --> 06:59:28,200
Ah, okay, I'm bleeding.

5670
06:59:36,110 --> 06:59:36,670
Oof.

5671
06:59:37,030 --> 06:59:37,910
Snake, are you okay?

5672
06:59:45,310 --> 06:59:46,850
I could kill.

5673
06:59:47,230 --> 06:59:48,010
I could kill.

5674
06:59:50,010 --> 06:59:51,050
You think they'll know...

5675
06:59:51,050 --> 06:59:53,750
They will know it's me if I...

5676
06:59:54,630 --> 06:59:55,750
If I...

5677
06:59:58,050 --> 07:00:00,610
Leave now, but even in with this...

5678
07:00:00,610 --> 07:00:01,030
What is it?

5679
07:00:03,470 --> 07:00:05,190
I'm sorry, guys.

5680
07:00:10,290 --> 07:00:11,830
I'm trying to remember.

5681
07:00:20,090 --> 07:00:21,770
How to get to Sokolov.

5682
07:00:21,970 --> 07:00:22,590
I'm trying to remember.

5683
07:00:24,470 --> 07:00:26,580
And my brain is not coming up with it.

5684
07:00:32,900 --> 07:00:33,960
Okay, Shreig.

5685
07:00:34,100 --> 07:00:34,640
I'm sorry.

5686
07:00:34,800 --> 07:00:35,900
I'm starving you.

5687
07:00:36,760 --> 07:00:37,940
I'm starving you.

5688
07:00:39,200 --> 07:00:39,820
I'm starving you.

5689
07:00:44,290 --> 07:00:45,290
There you go.

5690
07:00:46,450 --> 07:00:46,490
Mmm.

5691
07:00:48,650 --> 07:00:48,730
Mmm.

5692
07:00:51,910 --> 07:00:52,210
Mmm.

5693
07:00:58,510 --> 07:00:59,550
I'm going to save.

5694
07:01:00,950 --> 07:01:01,610
You want to save?

5695
07:01:02,010 --> 07:01:02,230
Yeah.

5696
07:01:02,230 --> 07:01:02,970
Hold on a sec.

5697
07:01:03,430 --> 07:01:03,630
Yeah.

5698
07:01:08,400 --> 07:01:11,020
Snake, have you seen Earth versus the spider?

5699
07:01:11,500 --> 07:01:12,480
Do you think he has?

5700
07:01:12,640 --> 07:01:16,200
It's about the spider that suddenly mutates into a giant monster.

5701
07:01:16,280 --> 07:01:16,460
Oh.

5702
07:01:16,540 --> 07:01:21,040
They bring it into the city in a state of hibernation, but it wakes up and starts wrecking the place.

5703
07:01:21,060 --> 07:01:23,840
So why did the spider turn huge?

5704
07:01:24,500 --> 07:01:26,180
I told you, it suddenly mutated.

5705
07:01:26,960 --> 07:01:27,580
Yeah, right.

5706
07:01:28,620 --> 07:01:31,840
Snake, it's people like you that take all the fun out of watching movies.

5707
07:01:32,380 --> 07:01:34,960
Always nitpicking and taking things too seriously.

5708
07:01:35,440 --> 07:01:36,800
Honestly, why even bother?

5709
07:01:37,800 --> 07:01:40,480
Look, the important thing isn't that it got big.

5710
07:01:41,080 --> 07:01:42,140
Then what is important?

5711
07:01:42,840 --> 07:01:45,660
The fact that there's a huge spider destroying the city.

5712
07:01:46,800 --> 07:01:47,980
Suspend your disbelief.

5713
07:01:48,360 --> 07:01:49,760
That's the whole point of movies.

5714
07:01:50,080 --> 07:01:50,640
Exactly.

5715
07:01:54,060 --> 07:02:03,620
paramedic you could you could not piss me off you could reassure me that everything's okay not piss me off okay

5716
07:02:15,560 --> 07:02:28,500
the second silliest man is too serious okay we only have 16 15 seconds left and then I They won't run into any more soldiers.

5717
07:02:29,200 --> 07:02:30,400
I pinky promise.

5718
07:02:31,280 --> 07:02:32,860
Break your promise, break your pinky.

5719
07:02:35,200 --> 07:02:37,580
I'll break every single one of yours.

5720
07:02:41,260 --> 07:02:41,700
Two!

5721
07:02:42,540 --> 07:02:43,020
One!

5722
07:02:44,060 --> 07:02:44,540
Didi!

5723
07:02:45,740 --> 07:02:46,860
Cancelling the alert.

5724
07:02:47,140 --> 07:02:48,040
Return to your position.

5725
07:02:54,400 --> 07:02:55,620
Oh wait, what's over here?

5726
07:02:58,340 --> 07:02:59,000
Okay.

5727
07:02:59,940 --> 07:03:00,700
Have they left?

5728
07:03:01,500 --> 07:03:02,220
Have they left?

5729
07:03:03,000 --> 07:03:04,860
Is it safe to open the door?

5730
07:03:18,400 --> 07:03:19,940
You don't see me.

5731
07:03:35,660 --> 07:03:36,620
Gornini Gorky.

5732
07:03:36,860 --> 07:03:37,000
Me?

5733
07:03:37,240 --> 07:03:38,360
Gornini Gorky.

5734
07:03:40,240 --> 07:03:41,000
Hello, sir.

5735
07:03:43,280 --> 07:03:43,720
Oh, my God.

5736
07:03:43,860 --> 07:03:45,020
I'm trying to get around this box.

5737
07:03:46,100 --> 07:03:46,940
What was this room?

5738
07:03:49,540 --> 07:03:50,520
Oh, here we go.

5739
07:03:51,440 --> 07:03:51,920
Ah.

5740
07:03:54,300 --> 07:03:54,700
Hello.

5741
07:03:55,640 --> 07:03:56,380
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

5742
07:04:07,410 --> 07:04:08,470
It's a nini-minkey.

5743
07:04:14,260 --> 07:04:15,360
Oh, he did it.

5744
07:04:18,220 --> 07:04:19,080
Oh, that's right.

5745
07:04:19,200 --> 07:04:19,860
Here we go.

5746
07:04:20,720 --> 07:04:22,620
Here's where we go through the nerd lab.

5747
07:04:25,240 --> 07:04:26,340
Oh, don't mind me.

5748
07:04:29,670 --> 07:04:31,410
I want to get in here, too, though.

5749
07:04:32,850 --> 07:04:33,390
There's a...

5750
07:04:33,390 --> 07:04:34,530
Isn't there, like, another gun in here?

5751
07:04:34,550 --> 07:05:00,090
here if I remember correctly there was oh wait I think it's actually the sig the isn't the cigarette spray I think actually hello don't walk into me I'll walk around you oh I'm trying please I'm trying not to do that I don't want to seem so suspicious.

5752
07:05:04,240 --> 07:05:04,640
Yes!

5753
07:05:05,120 --> 07:05:05,520
Ah!

5754
07:05:06,120 --> 07:05:08,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

5755
07:05:08,020 --> 07:05:08,480
I knew it.

5756
07:05:08,520 --> 07:05:09,020
Oh, gosh.

5757
07:05:09,240 --> 07:05:09,360
Wait.

5758
07:05:09,860 --> 07:05:10,860
I'm sorry, sir.

5759
07:05:11,360 --> 07:05:12,740
Uh, I don't mean to run into you.

5760
07:05:23,420 --> 07:05:25,220
He looked right at the camera.

5761
07:05:42,670 --> 07:05:43,450
Oh, my gosh.

5762
07:05:43,570 --> 07:05:44,010
We did it.

5763
07:05:50,810 --> 07:05:52,170
Wait, I need to get over there, mister.

5764
07:05:54,530 --> 07:05:55,410
Can you move?

5765
07:05:56,390 --> 07:05:57,260
Don't notice me.

5766
07:06:03,250 --> 07:06:03,610
Oh no.

5767
07:06:04,290 --> 07:06:04,970
Wait, I'm scared.

5768
07:06:05,250 --> 07:06:06,150
I'm scared of this room.

5769
07:06:10,340 --> 07:06:11,060
This is my...

5770
07:06:11,060 --> 07:06:11,960
Oh, Gakko.

5771
07:06:13,200 --> 07:06:14,560
Of course there would be a battery in here.

5772
07:06:15,180 --> 07:06:16,460
I'm just gonna run for it.

5773
07:06:20,840 --> 07:06:21,420
Oh my!

5774
07:06:21,460 --> 07:06:21,640
Oh my gosh!

5775
07:06:21,920 --> 07:06:24,180
Wait, it's time for our shoes!

5776
07:06:26,660 --> 07:06:28,520
Wait, this one is great!

5777
07:06:28,880 --> 07:06:29,840
Oh my gosh, we're...

5778
07:06:30,680 --> 07:06:32,140
We're scientists the whole time.

5779
07:06:35,060 --> 07:06:37,540
Wait, now are the figures behind him?

5780
07:06:37,660 --> 07:06:38,700
Are they, like, really high-deaf?

5781
07:06:44,200 --> 07:06:47,760
If you're looking for Sokolov, he's not here anymore.

5782
07:06:51,810 --> 07:06:53,290
Wow, it's the old theme.

5783
07:06:53,890 --> 07:06:54,830
Spoil my drink.

5784
07:06:57,910 --> 07:07:00,930
So, you're the intruder everyone's talking about.

5785
07:07:03,050 --> 07:07:04,850
Typical capitalist dog.

5786
07:07:04,930 --> 07:07:05,890
It is so high-deaf.

5787
07:07:06,070 --> 07:08:09,770
manners hey and who are you you mean you've never heard of me the guy on the wall oh my gosh wait everything is so high-deaf this is insane you guys are kind of blocking go to the enders i am alexander leonovich granin a man of some importance if i do say so myself oh my god i am the foremost weapon scientist in the soviet union I'm the head of the glorious Grunian design bureau literal jump scare this is the order of Lenin it is an honor of the greatest magnitude given along with the title of hero of socialism to only the finest workers it was awarded to me in recognition of my brilliant contributions to society since the great patriotic war I have created countless weapons in the service of our great communist society.

5788
07:08:09,830 --> 07:08:10,310
Oh, there's Ray on the right.

5789
07:08:11,790 --> 07:08:17,030
It was thanks to me that we were able to stamp out the Nazi scum.

5790
07:08:19,470 --> 07:08:30,710
It was I who created the basic design for the mobile ballistic missile system you know and fear as SS-1C.

5791
07:08:37,110 --> 07:08:38,370
Oh, is this rematch?

5792
07:08:38,590 --> 07:08:39,190
You're crocked, aren't you?

5793
07:08:39,230 --> 07:08:39,830
It's not me.

5794
07:08:42,230 --> 07:08:44,470
I'm merely drowning in my sorrow.

5795
07:08:44,770 --> 07:08:45,630
Actually, not me this time.

5796
07:08:46,350 --> 07:08:46,910
Because of him.

5797
07:08:47,590 --> 07:08:49,730
I've got nothing to do but sit here.

5798
07:08:52,650 --> 07:08:54,170
Drink this crap.

5799
07:08:55,450 --> 07:08:55,850
Him.

5800
07:08:58,070 --> 07:08:58,630
Sokolov.

5801
07:09:01,070 --> 07:09:02,930
It's him you're looking for, isn't it?

5802
07:09:03,090 --> 07:09:03,410
Uh-huh.

5803
07:09:06,070 --> 07:09:08,270
I have been stripped of my authority.

5804
07:09:08,810 --> 07:09:10,290
My research has come to nothing.

5805
07:09:10,730 --> 07:09:11,510
It's kind of crazy.

5806
07:09:11,790 --> 07:09:15,310
Look Like Granon's the guy that came up with stuff.

5807
07:09:15,810 --> 07:09:33,810
It is a revolutionary mobile nuclear missile system a bipedal tank Oh my god, it's so high depth a bipedal tank Yes, a walking tank a robot It's crazy.

5808
07:09:34,170 --> 07:09:35,490
Are you familiar with the theory?

5809
07:09:35,650 --> 07:09:36,230
It's so crazy It's crazy.

5810
07:09:37,010 --> 07:09:38,710
Between apes and humans.

5811
07:09:39,330 --> 07:09:41,230
And then someone comes in and steals it all.

5812
07:09:42,050 --> 07:09:44,650
This technology will be the missing link between infantry and artillery.

5813
07:09:44,870 --> 07:09:46,510
It's actually, it tries to be insane.

5814
07:09:48,410 --> 07:09:53,590
And this magnificent metal gear will mark a revolutionary step forward in weapons development.

5815
07:09:53,850 --> 07:09:54,530
Metal gear.

5816
07:09:54,870 --> 07:09:56,550
Metal gear.

5817
07:09:59,700 --> 07:10:01,710
But I won't be used so easily.

5818
07:10:02,530 --> 07:10:04,530
No, no crying myself to sleep.

5819
07:10:05,410 --> 07:10:09,570
Oh, you see, I'm going to send these documents to my friend in the United States.

5820
07:10:09,830 --> 07:10:09,990
Ah!

5821
07:10:10,950 --> 07:10:11,370
Ah!

5822
07:10:13,270 --> 07:10:15,110
This bastard will live to regret this.

5823
07:10:15,230 --> 07:10:16,190
Oh my god!

5824
07:10:16,210 --> 07:10:21,690
And when they themselves become the targets of my creation, they will know my true greatness.

5825
07:10:22,770 --> 07:10:23,290
Yes.

5826
07:10:24,230 --> 07:10:28,950
Sokolov's pathetic shagohan pales in comparison to my work.

5827
07:10:29,190 --> 07:10:30,670
Don't do it!

5828
07:10:30,690 --> 07:10:31,290
For real!

5829
07:10:31,290 --> 07:10:32,810
What are you going to do with a rocket engine on a tank?

5830
07:10:32,810 --> 07:10:33,890
Don't do it, Granin!

5831
07:10:34,530 --> 07:10:35,590
How about Sokolov?

5832
07:10:36,610 --> 07:10:38,110
The tank does not need a rocket.

5833
07:10:39,310 --> 07:10:40,370
It needs something else.

5834
07:10:41,970 --> 07:10:42,550
Look at these.

5835
07:10:43,970 --> 07:10:44,790
Nice shoes.

5836
07:10:44,790 --> 07:10:45,270
Nice shoes.

5837
07:10:46,190 --> 07:10:46,870
No.

5838
07:10:48,530 --> 07:10:48,810
Legs.

5839
07:10:49,170 --> 07:10:51,250
Legs that allow it to go anywhere.

5840
07:10:52,070 --> 07:10:54,170
Just as when humans learn to walk up.

5841
07:10:54,610 --> 07:10:57,570
That is the real revolution in weaponry.

5842
07:10:57,970 --> 07:10:58,650
Don't you agree?

5843
07:10:59,110 --> 07:11:00,890
He's actually so dumb.

5844
07:11:01,670 --> 07:11:04,190
But, the fool's in charge.

5845
07:11:05,010 --> 07:11:35,930
it's your sokolov and where is sokolov my project has been terminated philosopher's legacy has been handed over to him what the hell are you talking about the philosopher's legacy oh my gosh you guys I have that right here on my desk you think I'm at the target now their immense legacy we'll get The music is so whimsical,

5846
07:11:36,190 --> 07:11:36,530
it's funny.

5847
07:11:36,750 --> 07:11:38,610
Volgin's money laundering activities.

5848
07:11:40,930 --> 07:11:44,970
In the confusion of the war, they somehow ended up with their treasure.

5849
07:11:47,550 --> 07:11:50,270
And Volgin inherited that treasure illegally.

5850
07:11:52,850 --> 07:11:55,390
We never need to worry about the military budget.

5851
07:11:56,350 --> 07:12:00,610
The development costs at our facility are all paid out of the colonel's deep pockets.

5852
07:12:02,810 --> 07:12:36,770
The weapons born here will be the genes for creating an entirely new form of warfare because I have the philosopher's legacy the funding for my research came out of that legacy came out of it now my money my men all have been diverted to the Shagohan project tomorrow they will be conducting the final test while Sokolov is making the final preparations in the weapons factory at Volgan's main base the great fortress of Grozny Grad.

5853
07:12:37,310 --> 07:12:42,230
Here I am, playing host to an enemy spy and drinking myself into a stupor.

5854
07:12:43,030 --> 07:12:44,090
That's where they move Sokolov.

5855
07:12:45,090 --> 07:12:45,110
Yes.

5856
07:12:45,710 --> 07:12:47,210
And the Shagohod is there, too.

5857
07:12:48,010 --> 07:12:48,650
Of course.

5858
07:12:53,180 --> 07:12:56,640
Hey, you're not thinking of going to Grozny Grad.

5859
07:12:58,120 --> 07:12:59,480
Are you mad?

5860
07:12:59,780 --> 07:13:01,520
It's an impenetrable fortress.

5861
07:13:02,240 --> 07:13:03,340
I'm sure it is.

5862
07:13:03,980 --> 07:13:04,980
You'll be killed.

5863
07:13:05,480 --> 07:13:06,420
I'll take my chances.

5864
07:13:06,840 --> 07:13:39,620
at so high-deaf wait what listen to me i want to help you help me oh oh sorry oh my god what compliment i just did wait how do you how did i do that no tachiana gave them to me i wanted to thank you for complimenting me on me i'll tell you how to get into the fortress in return i ask only that idiot out of there and destroy the Shagohan.

5865
07:13:39,720 --> 07:13:40,160
It's not.

5866
07:13:40,280 --> 07:13:41,160
Oh, oh, God.

5867
07:13:41,360 --> 07:13:43,320
There is an underground tunnel that runs around the perimeter.

5868
07:13:43,760 --> 07:13:44,460
Oh, my God.

5869
07:13:46,140 --> 07:13:46,560
Oh, my God.

5870
07:13:46,560 --> 07:13:46,640
Oh, my God.

5871
07:13:46,720 --> 07:13:50,040
You should be able to use it to sneak into the base.

5872
07:13:52,040 --> 07:13:52,900
No, it's L2.

5873
07:13:53,380 --> 07:13:54,200
Sorry, I'm stupid.

5874
07:13:54,440 --> 07:13:54,760
I can't.

5875
07:13:54,800 --> 07:13:56,120
I mixed up my left and my right.

5876
07:13:56,240 --> 07:13:57,120
The entrance to the tunnel is located there.

5877
07:13:58,280 --> 07:13:58,700
Take this.

5878
07:14:02,140 --> 07:14:02,700
What's that?

5879
07:14:06,100 --> 07:14:06,540
Enhance.

5880
07:14:06,840 --> 07:14:38,000
you passed through a warehouse on your way here didn't you yes yeah there should have been a locked door inside of it will you remember it no this key uh-huh open that door okay beyond that door lies a vast jungle you can climb up into the mountains from the far end of the jungle Go back to the warehouse.

5881
07:14:38,740 --> 07:14:39,540
That door.

5882
07:14:39,860 --> 07:14:41,560
Use the key to open the locked door.

5883
07:14:43,080 --> 07:14:43,800
That door.

5884
07:14:44,320 --> 07:14:45,880
Camera's been drinking too.

5885
07:14:47,560 --> 07:14:48,040
Sorry.

5886
07:14:48,540 --> 07:14:50,420
I don't want to make anybody feel sick.

5887
07:14:51,240 --> 07:14:52,320
Why are you helping me?

5888
07:14:53,100 --> 07:14:58,980
Unlike Sokolov, the thought of defecting has never once crossed my mind.

5889
07:15:02,430 --> 07:15:05,250
I love my country.

5890
07:15:06,610 --> 07:15:08,470
I love this land.

5891
07:15:09,830 --> 07:15:12,570
I cannot even imagine living anywhere else.

5892
07:15:16,100 --> 07:15:21,360
I wish I could have known about the Zoom when put the shoes.

5893
07:15:24,560 --> 07:15:29,920
I cannot bear the thought of being hounded into a corner and left to waste away.

5894
07:15:31,840 --> 07:15:32,980
It is already dark.

5895
07:15:33,060 --> 07:15:33,400
Oh gosh.

5896
07:15:34,440 --> 07:15:35,080
We must hurry.

5897
07:15:36,400 --> 07:15:39,940
I will remain here and nurse my troubles for a little longer.

5898
07:15:44,340 --> 07:15:46,540
It even like, you see that?

5899
07:15:46,640 --> 07:15:47,860
It, like, blurs the background.

5900
07:15:48,100 --> 07:15:49,060
To capitalism.

5901
07:15:49,660 --> 07:15:50,860
It's kind of crazy.

5902
07:15:57,110 --> 07:15:59,410
Maybe something you could use in the theater later.

5903
07:15:59,890 --> 07:16:00,010
Right!

5904
07:16:00,770 --> 07:16:01,850
To capitalism.

5905
07:16:06,470 --> 07:16:06,770
Ha.

5906
07:16:07,430 --> 07:16:10,970
Well, guys, it's only been seven hours, but I think I'm going to call it here.

5907
07:16:12,850 --> 07:16:13,370
Um...

5908
07:16:14,310 --> 07:16:17,310
Hold on, let me see my calendar for this week.

5909
07:16:18,110 --> 07:16:19,670
Because I haven't put out a schedule yet.

5910
07:16:22,250 --> 07:16:24,170
I think I'll pick up...

5911
07:16:24,170 --> 07:16:25,610
Oh, wait, I was going to finish...

5912
07:16:25,610 --> 07:16:27,710
I was going to try and do Walking Dead twice.

5913
07:16:31,510 --> 07:16:32,930
Maybe I'll just do it next week.

5914
07:16:37,950 --> 07:16:39,330
I'm not streaming tomorrow.

5915
07:16:39,490 --> 07:16:40,110
No, no, no.

5916
07:16:40,750 --> 07:16:41,930
I will put out a schedule.

5917
07:16:42,350 --> 07:16:43,810
I might move some stuff around.

5918
07:16:46,130 --> 07:16:52,850
Since now I'm currently doing three games, Half-Life, Walking Dead, and Metal Gear, so...

5919
07:16:57,570 --> 07:17:04,890
I do want to try and get this done, though, so I might start at the same time on Sunday and just kind of power through it.

5920
07:17:06,890 --> 07:17:11,110
I would do Saturday as a Metal Gear Saturday thing, but I have a collab that day.

5921
07:17:16,910 --> 07:18:16,970
yeah i think we'll do that what do you guys think so far oh my gosh it like i said i think earlier like it's the same experience but also feels so different at the same time things are this super fun stream and this has been fun and you should play with what you want whatever you want thank you dorko thank you for the peek yeah like it plays very smoothly it's i you know I I know a lot of people were cautiously optimistic and a lot of people were very skeptical but I think they knocked it out of the park I would like to I think I could say that I think it's I think it's been good so yeah yeah yeah yeah my first time watching someone play Metal Gear,

5922
07:18:17,070 --> 07:18:17,790
it looks super fine.

5923
07:18:18,190 --> 07:18:18,590
Yes!

5924
07:18:19,030 --> 07:18:20,730
This is the first game in the timeline.

5925
07:18:21,370 --> 07:18:28,970
So, um, you know, a good place to start if you want to.

5926
07:18:31,830 --> 07:18:36,210
Um, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I am so happy.

5927
07:18:37,850 --> 07:18:43,030
I should be using some of, I feel like I've used the Croc outfit most of the time, but, oh, whoops.

5928
07:18:43,470 --> 07:18:51,070
Well, I feel like I should use some of the other DLC outfits that I got.

5929
07:18:51,330 --> 07:18:53,510
Like, grenade I use a lot, because why would I?

5930
07:18:55,550 --> 07:18:56,990
Happy to catch the stream today, Minto.

5931
07:18:57,470 --> 07:18:58,090
Thank you!

5932
07:18:59,230 --> 07:19:01,630
I don't play much Metal Gear and know much about it.

5933
07:19:02,090 --> 07:19:04,470
But whenever I see it, I always get enjoyment out of it.

5934
07:19:06,370 --> 07:19:07,850
Just got back from AMIC.

5935
07:19:08,530 --> 07:19:08,970
Had a blast.

5936
07:19:09,130 --> 07:19:11,350
Can't help feeling some MGS con foe, but...

5937
07:19:12,530 --> 07:19:13,010
MGS con?

5938
07:19:13,030 --> 07:20:31,270
con phoma i feel like amic was so much fun too i wouldn't have known which one to pick either miss thank you so much for the peek yeah i think i'm just all i mean i'm usually metal gear brand but right now i'm like i'm i'm deep deep in it i'm i'm i'm because my love was really revived by the con like it was just you know there's like obviously going to an anime convention is a lot of fun but yeah yeah thanks jordan princess but going to something that is like a specialized niche like a like a singular fandom kind of convention is so so different because everybody is on like the same wavelength everybody's telling the same jokes everybody's kind of vibing with the same stuff like anybody you could turn to your left you could turn to your right anybody next to you could become a potential friend because you already have a uh a similar interest you know everyone has the same brain rod exactly it's really nice and a bit for me of not having seen much overplayed mgs3 to enjoy this without

5939
07:20:31,270 --> 07:20:34,070
