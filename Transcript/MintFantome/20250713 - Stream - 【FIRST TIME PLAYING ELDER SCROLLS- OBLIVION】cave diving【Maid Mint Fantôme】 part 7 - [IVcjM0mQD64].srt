00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,560
Welcome back to Oblivion.

2
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Hello.

3
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,940
Hello.

4
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,720
Hello, I'm still sleepy.

5
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,160
It's a...

6
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,340
I never stream this early.

7
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Hey, Mint, you're finally awake.

8
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm not!

9
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,820
Happy belated not birthday.

10
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,460
Aw, thank you.

11
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,180
Oblivion theme cover win.

12
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

13
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,740
Ba-ba-ba-bom-bom-bom-bom.

14
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,140
And dum-dum-dum.

15
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,980
He-he-he.

16
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Hello!

17
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,120
Coffee time.

18
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,040
I do have a coffee.

19
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,800
Right here.

20
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,820
Luckily, I will turn it down a little bit.

21
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,320
There we go.

22
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,080
Yeah!

23
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,340
Uh, we're back with more Oblivion!

24
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,420
More sneaking!

25
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,560
More...

26
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,040
uh...

27
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,740
Death!

28
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,680
More...

29
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
But not me...

30
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,040
Hahaha!

31
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,860
More!

32
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,060
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Lockpicking!

33
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,700
My murder!

34
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,400
More!

35
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,720
Cop, cop, cop, cop, cop!

36
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,800
Of course, more Itina.

37
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,860
She's our girl!

38
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,940
Hahaha!

39
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,240
She's our girl!

40
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,120
Don't say lick-pocking!

41
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,120
I had to really think about it!

42
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,860
Hahaha!

43
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
I feel like I'm just gonna...

44
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,520
You know how when you accidentally mistype something so many times in your phone?

45
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
And then it's like, oh, you obviously mean this now.

46
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,640
I feel like my brain is going to overwrite lockpicking to lick-pocking.

47
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,140
And I'm just not gonna be able to...

48
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,140
I will be able to function!

49
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,480
Hahaha!

50
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,530
It's how language evolves.

51
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,430
I don't...

52
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,030
I think it's just me!

53
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,130
Hahaha!

54
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,710
Hahaha!

55
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,850
Hahaha!

56
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,630
I don't think it's a language thing!

57
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,690
Wait, so does that mean if I had little ghost children...

58
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,860
Then they would also evolve to say...

59
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,450
Lick-pocking.

60
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,670
And then if they had ghost children...

61
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,110
Then it would become...

62
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,590
They would also say...

63
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,470
Lick-pocking.

64
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,070
And then it would spread!

65
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,450
Your children evolve!

66
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,530
Hahaha!

67
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:19,570
Hahaha!

68
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,370
Ah!

69
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:21,730
Ah!

70
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,910
Ah!

71
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,250
I already have that on my list of things to do, though.

72
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,290
It's to self-evolve.

73
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,910
Eventually.

74
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,170
Maybe.

75
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,750
What do you mean, huh?

76
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,010
No, don't evolve children!

77
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,810
Evolve me!

78
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,390
I want to...

79
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,410
I want to...

80
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,600
I want to...

81
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,130
Evolve.

82
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,560
It doesn't evolve children.

83
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,960
Involve!

84
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,540
It doesn't involve children!

85
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,120
I want to evolve like I'm a PokÃ©mon.

86
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,220
You can lick as many pox as you want.

87
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,620
What?

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,740
Is lick a bad word?

89
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,420
Hahaha!

90
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,100
Or wait...

91
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,440
Is that supposed to be lock?

92
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,480
Oh, no.

93
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,980
Wait, I can't tell!

94
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,340
Necromancy is banned!

95
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,160
No!

96
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,760
Spamming bee to stop evolution!

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,080
Nooo!

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,040
Nooo!

99
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,300
Nooo!

100
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,380
Don't!

101
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't hold me back!

102
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,760
Let me become my full potential!

103
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,120
Hahaha!

104
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,560
Let me reach my full potential!

105
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,920
What would you evolve into?

106
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,740
I don't know!

107
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,220
That's the exciting part!

108
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,920
Nooo!

109
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Hahaha!

110
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,940
I got blocked trying to say lick!

111
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,560
Eww!

112
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,340
YouTube thinks it's a little freaky, maybe.

113
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,280
Ice cream, Chibi Minto!

114
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,460
Why am I ice cream?

115
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,700
Why?

116
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,220
Can't believe Minto is back to lick our pox.

117
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,440
That sounds bad, though.

118
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Don't say it like that!

119
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,640
Also, hello, Gerardo!

120
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,020
Welcome back!

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,820
Can you evolve to Gengar if we trade you over the link cable?

122
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,280
What if I...

123
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,380
What if I...

124
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,000
What if I...

125
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,720
What if...

126
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
What if...

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,620
I've...

128
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,780
You...

129
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,440
The cable is...

130
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,340
Optional.

131
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,480
Right?

132
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,180
Are you like a Digimon?

133
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
Mintymon...

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,040
Mintymon...

135
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,680
Mintymon...

136
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Mintymon...

137
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,540
Digital Ghost...

138
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,160
Digital Ghost is the champion!

139
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,430
Yes...

140
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,330
Anyway...

141
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,310
It's been a minute since I last played Oblivion.

142
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,990
Let's load the game.

143
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,970
Hello, E.T.

144
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,470
and I...

145
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,010
It must be this autosave.

146
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,790
Wait, where...

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
I'm in the church.

148
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,710
What was I doing?

149
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,870
It's been almost a month since I last played, you guys!

150
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,690
Look at that!

151
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,270
Save...

152
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,410
Oh, my big head is blocking the way.

153
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,210
The save date was June 15th!

154
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,290
You know what?

155
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,210
That means we will just...

156
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,770
Do whatever we want to do!

157
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,670
We don't have...

158
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,330
We are not bound by...

159
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,750
Previous attempts.

160
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,830
Your chibi looks like one of those Spongebob Ice Pops.

161
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,290
What about now?

162
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,130
What about now?

163
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,650
Wait...

164
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,790
Now...

165
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,370
Okay, I'm like the Ice Pops that...

166
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,310
Hold on...

167
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,030
There we go...

168
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,550
I'm one of the Ice Pops that...

169
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,050
Are deformed...

170
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,680
It melted before you opened the package.

171
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,180
But those...

172
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,800
Never seem to work, huh?

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,740
Starting to melt them a bit.

174
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,820
It's a treat to witness your return, E-Tina.

175
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,550
I can't open that shack.

176
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,570
Everybody...

177
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,170
Say hi!

178
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,370
Why?

179
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,630
Oh wait!

180
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,710
We got a new outfit!

181
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,510
Why are we wearing a hood?

182
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,930
To distract from our beautiful hair?

183
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,110
What did I do?

184
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,270
The shrouded hood.

185
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,470
No armor.

186
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,930
Hi!

187
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,290
Hi, E-Tina!

188
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,210
You're looking as magnificent as you have always looked.

189
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,390
Look at that.

190
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,370
E-Tina!

191
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,710
The hood was an armor bonus.

192
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,010
I believe so, too.

193
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,140
Now it just looks like E-T!

194
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,720
I think this...

195
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,660
Ruins the disguise!

196
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,630
E-Tina!

197
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,950
Phone home!

198
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,870
Is E-Tina just E-T with a wig?

199
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,210
No!

200
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,650
What?

201
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,210
That's...

202
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,110
That's...

203
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,470
That would be ridiculous!

204
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,970
And that was your whole point.

205
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,650
What?

206
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,250
Crazy!

207
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:30,810
No!

208
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,190
Obviously...

209
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,310
E-Tina is a wood elf, and not an alien from another planet.

210
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,870
No!

211
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,490
Obviously, E-Tina is not from space!

212
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,510
And not E-T!

213
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,150
She's a wood elf!

214
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,730
She's nimble and quick!

215
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,530
With the hood on E-T, she get blamed for all her crimes.

216
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,410
Perfect disguise!

217
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:04,950
Oh wait!

218
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,270
That's actually such a genius!

219
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,630
That's so genius, actually!

220
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,130
Meet the phone home!

221
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,910
Let's see...

222
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,930
There's one big thing I really want to do...

223
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,490
And that's...

224
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,150
Get a house!

225
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,410
Especially the haunted house!

226
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,710
I know that is one gold that I've always had!

227
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,010
And it's...

228
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,270
We need what?

229
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,490
5,000 gold?

230
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,890
Wait!

231
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,090
I'm only 2,000 away!

232
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,530
Has anyone seen E-T and E-Tina in the same room before?

233
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,930
Every house I live in is haunted!

234
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,710
Yeah, but not in...

235
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:53,570
Game!

236
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,830
E-Tina is not a ghost!

237
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,990
I shouldn't be talking to these guys!

238
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,350
How do you do?

239
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,510
No, don't talk to me!

240
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,050
I'm...

241
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,750
I remember last time I would talk...

242
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,330
Stand clear!

243
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,750
Last time I would talk to them, they'd try to arrest me!

244
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,830
I don't remember why!

245
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,170
I...

246
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,090
I'm traumatized now!

247
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,990
Let's see...

248
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,970
Okay, let's go to the map...

249
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay, we're all the way here because we were at the brotherhood...

250
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,770
With our brothers...

251
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,750
Our devilish brothers and sisters...

252
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,150
It's in...

253
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,450
Kvatch, right?

254
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,030
Enter the Eliminator...

255
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,910
I must accept a contract for Mochiva...

256
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,070
This one!

257
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,220
Anvil!

258
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,890
You're so right!

259
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,270
Let's just travel here...

260
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,050
You can see if you're...

261
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,390
If you have a bounty...

262
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,530
On the character screen...

263
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,170
Oh, you're right!

264
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,150
I did learn that last time too, I think...

265
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,250
Oh!

266
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,510
Suddenly it's daytime!

267
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,970
Okay, hold on...

268
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,610
Let's see...

269
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,350
Character...

270
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,490
Do I have a bounty?

271
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,650
Uh...

272
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,630
Oh, I think it's here, right?

273
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,810
I don't have a bounty!

274
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,690
Shivering Isles bounty...

275
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,250
Why is my infamy 11?

276
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,590
I'm the hero of that one city!

277
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,990
My fame should be like 500!

278
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,230
Who are you?

279
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,470
I'm Arvina Thales...

280
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,930
They call me...

281
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,930
The Rat Lady...

282
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,710
On account of all my pet rats...

283
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,730
Oh...

284
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,610
Because of your pet rats, huh?

285
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,470
You can't imagine the fuss...

286
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,570
Some people make...

287
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,070
My rats are no problem for anyone!

288
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,670
I bet...

289
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,750
I want to be her friend...

290
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,470
Farewell!

291
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,370
Goodbye!

292
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,050
They're so unhinged in this game!

293
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,370
This is the house I want, no?

294
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,650
Yes...

295
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,650
Yes?

296
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,350
Count arms...

297
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,490
No?

298
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,490
Who are you?

299
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,510
Greetings to you!

300
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,110
Are you the man...

301
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,650
No...

302
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,090
Horse...

303
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:25,790
No...

304
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,270
Dead Ear?

305
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,010
Is this the house I want?

306
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,970
Yes, it is!

307
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,570
You can go into our house and find all the rats...

308
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,450
Are they like the giant ass rats?

309
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,690
That manor is still for sale...

310
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,530
If you're interested...

311
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,930
My eyes are here!

312
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,910
If you want to buy Beneris manor...

313
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,910
It's still available for a modest price...

314
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,590
I want it!

315
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,590
No questions asked...

316
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,770
Please!

317
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,250
Please!

318
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,930
Can we...

319
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,150
Yes, here's 5,000 gold!

320
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,130
You don't even have enough money!

321
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,850
Stop wasting my time and come back when you do!

322
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,770
Okay...

323
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,450
He can't stop...

324
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,450
Maybe he's got like a lazy eye...

325
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,870
I'm in his lap right now...

326
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,910
Hey, what if I...

327
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,730
What did I just do?

328
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,810
I pressed C...

329
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,770
I was just trying to crouch...

330
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,130
What if I give you a little special service?

331
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,550
E-Tina style!

332
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,550
He doesn't care...

333
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,290
He's eating his bread...

334
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,790
Hello, good sir!

335
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,890
Oh!

336
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,670
Hello!

337
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,650
I used an invisibility scroll!

338
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Oh, I'm gonna reload...

339
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,680
Wait, F...

340
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,620
F9...

341
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,160
Sorry, it's been so long since I've played...

342
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,540
Wait!

343
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
I used an invisibility scroll and they...

344
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,580
He still talked to me...

345
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,350
It's your birthday!

346
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,170
Happy birthday!

347
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,550
I wish I could tell you what your name is...

348
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,470
But instead of...

349
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,970
YouTube's going by these...

350
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,350
Stupid...

351
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,310
At...

352
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,280
Signs...

353
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,790
Now...

354
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,210
So...

355
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,590
DSM, happy birthday!

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,660
Can I leave or...

357
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,300
F9 reloads the quick save...

358
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Not the auto save...

359
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Okay, then let's just...

360
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,140
Load...

361
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,520
Why are they blocking the door?

362
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,120
I don't know!

363
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,020
That's what I'm asking!

364
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,080
Okay...

365
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't use my invisibility...

366
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,860
Because it's precious...

367
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,720
Alright, I'll come back with your five...

368
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,620
Five thousand...

369
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,660
Hello, good...

370
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,900
Buckaroos...

371
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,340
I'll be...

372
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll be back!

373
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,980
I'll be back!

374
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,060
And then...

375
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,740
Oh, my goodness!

376
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh, there they are!

377
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,780
Which is the house, even, that I want?

378
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,120
Can I still go inside?

379
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Is this it?

380
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,360
By the church...

381
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,380
A third Sextius!

382
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,060
By the church...

383
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500
Fighters Guild...

384
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,510
I'm running, I'm running...

385
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,150
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running...

386
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,710
Climb!

387
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,790
Nice!

388
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,870
Oh, wait!

389
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,550
Was it this one?

390
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,100
Yes!

391
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,680
No, I don't need the...

392
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,860
It can be...

393
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,940
It can be picked...

394
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,340
Please!

395
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,320
Let me in!

396
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,560
Alright, well, what we'll do...

397
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,660
Is we'll...

398
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,380
Do some...

399
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,980
Caves...

400
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,300
Around this area...

401
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,660
So that we're nice and close...

402
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,940
And, um...

403
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,200
Yeah!

404
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,220
So we can go here!

405
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,460
Oh!

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,140
I guess I'll just fast travel, easy!

407
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Dungeon time!

408
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,840
Dungeon time!

409
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm gonna have to remember how to play this game!

410
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,060
The cave leads under Castle Anvil...

411
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,460
Wait, what?

412
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,900
What?

413
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,200
That one?

414
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,180
Right there?

415
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,740
Wait...

416
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,420
Is this...

417
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,240
Is this a dungeon?

418
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,280
Is this a dungeon?

419
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,600
Ha ha ha ha ha!

420
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,920
Um...

421
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Okay!

422
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,780
I don't re...

423
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,100
I still remember this?

424
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,980
Smuggler's Cave.

425
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,720
Well, they should have some good stuff, no?

426
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
Right?

427
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Right?

428
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,260
Should have some good stuff.

429
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,920
The music is not ominous yet, so maybe it's safe.

430
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,700
Okay...

431
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,580
Yarn...

432
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,120
Oh, I hear a Nurn Root.

433
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,400
So far, not so good.

434
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:51,980
Oh, wait.

435
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,180
Okay...

436
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,200
Wait, wait.

437
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Pickaxe.

438
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,240
Oh, yeah.

439
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,860
I hear it.

440
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,780
I hear the stinking flower.

441
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,100
Where are you?

442
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,700
Okay, that looks ominous.

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
Nothing here?

444
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,180
Oh, my gosh.

445
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,300
It's all a bunch of junk.

446
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,560
Wait, where's the root?

447
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you so much for the gift.

448
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,740
Thank you.

449
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,340
You guys hear it too?

450
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,800
Am I crazy?

451
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,660
I...

452
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,100
I only hear, like, over here.

453
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,540
Maybe it's above ground.

454
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,460
For those annoyed by YouTube switching your chat handle to the weird at name, you can alter your name and channel settings so they can be the same.

455
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,340
Please do!

456
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,280
Otherwise, I don't recognize people.

457
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
It makes me so sad.

458
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,960
Hisashimuri Ichina-san.

459
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,740
My brain is full of umamusume.

460
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,560
Just finished season two and it's so peak.

461
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,100
Excited to see more lockpicking.

462
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,440
Yes!

463
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,720
Lockpicking!

464
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,320
Yes!

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,420
You guys hear the root?

466
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
I hear it.

467
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:18,940
Ah!

468
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I found it.

469
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,160
Okay.

470
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,300
Onwards into the cave.

471
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,680
Oh!

472
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,680
Wait, what?

473
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh my god!

474
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,520
Nevermind!

475
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,620
There is no cave!

476
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,140
We got baited!

477
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,860
Get me out of here.

478
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Stinky.

479
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,500
What are these?

480
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,560
They're pretty.

481
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,740
Whoa!

482
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,960
There's a bunch of bugs even.

483
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,660
I'm gonna grab them with...

484
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:56,900
Okay.

485
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,840
Well, now, I'm not quite sure what to do.

486
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,040
I guess we'll explore until we find...

487
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,980
A dungeon.

488
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,900
We'll explore until we find a dungeon, I suppose.

489
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Um...

490
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,480
There's gotta be something around here.

491
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,120
There's...

492
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,420
Dogs barking.

493
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,220
Hmm...

494
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,820
Hmm...

495
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:25,860
Hmm...

496
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,160
Hmm...

497
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,300
YouTube changing names.

498
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,580
Yeah, as you can see in the chat, they're all like...

499
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,260
Ads or whatever.

500
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
So annoying.

501
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,280
I wonder what my at looks like.

502
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,300
Is it at Mint Phantom?

503
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,340
Or is it just a bunch of...

504
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,800
I've never...

505
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,340
I don't remember ever change...

506
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,960
Oh!

507
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,500
Oh!

508
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,560
Oh!

509
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,440
Oh!

510
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,560
What are they doing?

511
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
At Mint Phantom.

512
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,600
Oh!

513
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,540
Okay, it is.

514
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,860
Oh!

515
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,340
There's not another deer there!

516
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,900
Oh my goodness.

517
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,700
I thought I was about to get...

518
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,800
I thought YouTube was about to get really mad at me.

519
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,360
Sextius!

520
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,460
Sextius!

521
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,040
Sextius!

522
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,280
Okay, we're looking for a cave, everybody.

523
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,760
We're looking for...

524
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,440
A place to pillage.

525
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,780
I mean...

526
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,060
Not pillage.

527
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,420
Sorry.

528
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh wait!

529
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,680
That looks like...

530
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,580
An area over there.

531
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,220
Test.

532
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,200
Your test has been received.

533
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,680
What?

534
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,020
Do you want me to grade you too?

535
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,060
What are we bandits?

536
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,300
No!

537
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,960
We're so much more respectable than that.

538
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Fort!

539
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,420
Oh!

540
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Is that a bad...

541
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,640
Is that a bad dog?

542
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,960
I think so.

543
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,640
Oops.

544
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,460
Whoa!

545
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,990
Wait, is this his dog?

546
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,060
Wait...

547
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,320
There's someone talking.

548
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,460
Where'd my other arrow go?

549
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,060
I don't see it.

550
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,420
Ah!

551
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,000
Ah!

552
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,180
Show me what you've got!

553
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,860
Oh, dang it.

554
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,280
Wait, why are you...

555
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,240
Ouch!

556
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,250
Have you to pieces!

557
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,510
Stupid!

558
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,750
Leave me alone!

559
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
I guess he was the guy talking.

560
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,260
Do you own that horrible place?

561
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,760
Whoa!

562
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,700
He's got a lot of arrow.

563
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,160
Nice.

564
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,940
Take his potion.

565
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,620
Oh!

566
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,280
Steel dagger!

567
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,080
That's...

568
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,000
Can sell for...

569
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,280
A good amount, right?

570
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,460
Okay!

571
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,800
Oh!

572
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,200
Ah!

573
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,340
We found one!

574
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,700
Let's go in.

575
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,440
Hopefully there's some good loot in here.

576
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,460
Why are the...

577
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,400
Why is the music always so scary in these...

578
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,520
Ah!

579
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
In these places.

580
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
Are you gonna notice me?

581
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,520
Ah!

582
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,380
I can't tell which way they're facing.

583
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,940
Oh, not towards me.

584
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,300
Maybe?

585
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,280
Wait.

586
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,660
They are facing towards me.

587
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:00,700
Oh!

588
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
You think they're a friend?

589
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,880
I missed my chance.

590
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,020
Stood there for...

591
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,500
10 minutes.

592
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,760
Leave it to YouTube to make some of the weirdest changes.

593
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,860
I know, right?

594
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,600
Nobody asks for this.

595
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:23,980
I think he'll...

596
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,120
Oh!

597
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Jump on my sword while you can.

598
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,440
Oh, he's dead.

599
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,300
Okay.

600
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,600
Jump on my sword while you can.

601
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,520
What was...

602
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:38,920
Wow!

603
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,180
What does that mean?

604
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,480
Sir?

605
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,090
Okay!

606
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,130
Oh!

607
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,710
Wait!

608
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,830
These are worth a lot.

609
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,530
But it's gonna be really heavy.

610
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,970
Hold on.

611
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,690
We'll see what...

612
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,510
What we can take.

613
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,190
This is also worth a lot.

614
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,910
Alright.

615
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,420
Mister!

616
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,840
I know I just...

617
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,500
I...

618
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,780
I also made you bald.

619
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,700
Um...

620
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,240
I know that like...

621
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,180
That like...

622
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,900
I just stripped you of your clothes.

623
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,160
But I'm not going to...

624
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,300
Jump on your sword.

625
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,740
Oh my gosh.

626
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,860
That scared the hecky out of me.

627
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,860
Are you gonna come through or...

628
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,080
No?

629
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,160
You're just gonna be really mysterious?

630
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,770
These guys are tough!

631
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,490
Look!

632
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,450
I even cooked them over the open flame!

633
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,450
These guys scared...

634
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,590
Wait!

635
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,330
These are all...

636
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,730
Their...

637
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,210
Their stuff is worth so much!

638
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,470
Maybe I should just...

639
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,710
Loot these guys...

640
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,110
Of their clothes...

641
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,770
And then...

642
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,330
Sell it all!

643
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,070
I'm gonna be...

644
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,530
Overweight at this point!

645
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,760
Okay...

646
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,780
Oh wait...

647
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,720
What's my...

648
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,120
What am I looking at?

649
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,280
Um...

650
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,060
Wait...

651
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,080
Okay...

652
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,200
295!

653
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,480
Um...

654
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,320
Well, we're close to town, right?

655
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe I can just go sell it real quick.

656
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,820
Oh, this scared me.

657
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,560
I thought it was a person.

658
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,720
Ghosts have way...

659
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,380
We don't...

660
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,820
Oh...

661
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,340
I thought other...

662
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,980
Nope...

663
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,140
That's not what I meant to do...

664
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,880
There we go...

665
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,860
There's a dead guy right there!

666
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,440
Dead?

667
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,700
Wait...

668
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,300
Dead...

669
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,600
Right?

670
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,120
Dead?

671
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,240
Dead?

672
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,180
Sleep?

673
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,940
Gold!

674
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,380
Oh...

675
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,780
That's like a...

676
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,160
Okay...

677
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,800
I think that's dead.

678
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,800
Wait!

679
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,720
Okay...

680
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,180
Take this...

681
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,920
I know we're gonna be...

682
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,160
Overweight...

683
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,900
Okay...

684
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,080
Now we run...

685
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,240
Now we leave...

686
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,120
And we'll go sell...

687
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,040
Look at the cake on that man...

688
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,440
Alright...

689
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,210
I think your first arrow missed and hit the...

690
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,040
That...

691
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
This guy...

692
00:32:59,560 --> 00:32:59,920
Oh...

693
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,420
No kidding!

694
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,540
Oh wait...

695
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:02,900
Oh wait...

696
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,360
Baby...

697
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,200
That would be crazy!

698
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,780
I'm a secret genius!

699
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm a secret genius!

700
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,340
I'm a secret genius!

701
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,500
Actually...

702
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
It's not so much a secret anymore now...

703
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:16,760
Is it?

704
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,540
Yeah...

705
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Totally on purpose!

706
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,300
There I go...

707
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,780
Well as soon as I leave...

708
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,340
We can just...

709
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,980
We can...

710
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,620
Quick...

711
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,720
We can quick...

712
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,980
Travel...

713
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,400
You are now looting...

714
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,260
Oblivion style...

715
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,700
No kidding!

716
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,360
Am I doing it right?

717
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,840
Alright...

718
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,560
Now...

719
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,060
Oh wait...

720
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,860
My bad...

721
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,880
Just kidding!

722
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,420
You guys...

723
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,000
Um...

724
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,820
Isn't it nice though?

725
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,760
When we get to just hang out for a long amount of time...

726
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,060
You know?

727
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,920
Isn't it nice that we can just...

728
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,420
Enjoy...

729
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,620
The scenery...

730
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,820
And the journey together?

731
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,940
Walking simulator...

732
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,580
What in the Death Stranding is this?

733
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,320
Definitely...

734
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah!

735
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,360
This is why horse is good...

736
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,520
I don't know where my horse is...

737
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,620
Now we're playing Death Stranding...

738
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:32,980
Finally!

739
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,180
Oh...

740
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,320
I've thought about it...

741
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,660
I was like...

742
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,780
Maybe I should play Death Stranding...

743
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,200
The first game...

744
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,480
Off stream...

745
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,320
Cause I...

746
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,980
Will get through it...

747
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,100
Will get through it...

748
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,580
More quickly...

749
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,320
Especially if I have more days off...

750
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,820
Or if I just play Death Stranding...

751
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,320
No talking...

752
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,020
I could just...

753
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,220
Have my mic off...

754
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,560
I don't know...

755
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,880
I just really wanna play...

756
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,360
But...

757
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,940
Right now...

758
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,240
Because I'm trying to rest my...

759
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,500
Voice as much as possible...

760
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
It's like...

761
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,640
Well then I can't...

762
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,400
Play for a long time...

763
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,800
It was really sleepy...

764
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,100
Last night...

765
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
I got a notification...

766
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,140
For a voicemail...

767
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,120
From Mint...

768
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,700
That's from my phone provider...

769
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,640
Mint Mobile...

770
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,320
I have your phone number...

771
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,100
Oh...

772
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,180
Wow...

773
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,960
Lucky...

774
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,380
Lucky find...

775
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,120
Okay...

776
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,280
That is...

777
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,160
The castle...

778
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,410
We're trying to go find a store...

779
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,220
Hopefully there's one in here...

780
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,740
She has...

781
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,160
Actually I'm the owner of Mint Mobile...

782
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
That's me...

783
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,120
No mic streamers...

784
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,820
Okay...

785
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:50,980
Really?

786
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,120
Come on...

787
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,320
Okay...

788
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,540
Let's see...

789
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,580
Let's find a little store in here...

790
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,760
Ah...

791
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,280
Chapel...

792
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,520
Chapel...

793
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,560
House...

794
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,040
Manor...

795
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,060
Guild...

796
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,540
Can I sell things at the guild...

797
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:11,980
Or would it be better?

798
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,520
Probably...

799
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,100
Abandoned house...

800
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,160
Many homes...

801
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,480
House...

802
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,640
That's a peacemaker...

803
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,340
House...

804
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,160
Uh oh...

805
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,040
You're Ryan Gosling?

806
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,660
Oh my gosh...

807
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,980
You're Ryan...

808
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,500
I forgot that guy owns it...

809
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,280
He owns Mint Mobile...

810
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,410
Count...

811
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,890
Arms maybe...

812
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,790
No wait...

813
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,290
That's a...

814
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,970
Hotel, no?

815
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,630
Uh oh...

816
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,130
Is there like...

817
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,990
No store here?

818
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,390
Wait...

819
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,370
Where should I sell?

820
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,970
There's a store...

821
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,950
Outside on the docks...

822
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,050
Oh thank you...

823
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,670
Oh it's Ryan Reynolds...

824
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,430
You guys got it wrong then...

825
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,330
You guys said Gosling...

826
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,970
You guys said Ryan Gosling...

827
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,630
Head to the...

828
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,350
Head to the...

829
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,580
Oh...

830
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,860
Even with that voice...

831
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,280
Death Stranding is goofy on its own...

832
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,660
So...

833
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,300
Yes...

834
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,260
I will...

835
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,580
Look at that bug...

836
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,700
Whoa...

837
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,480
Oh...

838
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,340
Oh...

839
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:21,800
There...

840
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,720
What's happening to him?

841
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
What's happening to you?

842
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,420
Is...

843
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm like an...

844
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,320
Oh...

845
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,670
Never mind...

846
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,510
He was stuck in an invisible string...

847
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,050
Okay...

848
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,710
Good thing...

849
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,770
We don't have to swim...

850
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,670
Because I think I might actually sink...

851
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,590
It's...

852
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,910
Mejito Ryan...

853
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,250
No...

854
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,190
She's my enemy right now...

855
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,290
I'm not over it...

856
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,690
I'm not over...

857
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,910
My huge loss to Mejito Ryan...

858
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,690
No Mike Death Stranding...

859
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,730
It might be really nice...

860
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,160
I'll probably get hit with every copyright...

861
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,120
DMCA ever...

862
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,370
But that's okay...

863
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,030
I got hit with one recently...

864
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,190
It was so funny...

865
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,910
I got hit with a DMCA...

866
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,890
For a...

867
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,390
For a member stream...

868
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,910
Back in 2020...

869
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,910
They really just trying to...

870
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,050
Take every...

871
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,030
Nickel and dime from me...

872
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,930
Is this...

873
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,930
This looks like an inn...

874
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,770
The warehouse?

875
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,530
Is that it?

876
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,830
Maybe...

877
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,270
Or...

878
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,190
What is that?

879
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,910
This looks like a store...

880
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,110
Too many Ryans...

881
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,230
Maybe their names are fake...

882
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,170
You remind me of a witch I once knew...

883
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,990
I hate witches...

884
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,390
Okay...

885
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,370
You're a literal worm...

886
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,570
I don't think you have anything to say...

887
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,050
You remind me of a worm I once knew...

888
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,650
God...

889
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,830
Leave me alone...

890
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,290
I'm just existing...

891
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,730
They call me Wilhelm the Worm...

892
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,990
Because dirt suits me fine...

893
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,290
Town lets me live in the warehouse...

894
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,270
To keep out the rats...

895
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,830
Then you should be Wilhelm the Cat...

896
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:29,650
What?

897
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,450
You got any rumors?

898
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,230
I don't like you...

899
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,930
And I don't want to talk to you...

900
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,070
Why is everybody so rude?

901
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,790
I'm done talking to you...

902
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,330
I was not...

903
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,250
I was not...

904
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:45,910
Okay...

905
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,510
We need to wait...

906
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,870
They closed early...

907
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,330
So we need to stand here for 12 hours...

908
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,570
I'm sure Wilhelm will be really pleased about that...

909
00:39:59,370 --> 00:39:59,990
Wilhelm...

910
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,810
The asshole...

911
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,440
Got him...

912
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,570
Oh...

913
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,890
Look who else has been standing here...

914
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,270
Staring at me all night...

915
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,370
Don't bother me again...

916
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,810
And you might live to regret it...

917
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,210
You're an actual freak...

918
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,650
Please leave me alone...

919
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,310
Oh my god...

920
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,270
She's got jokes...

921
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,610
Hello...

922
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,810
Norbert...

923
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,470
What do you want?

924
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,210
Do you have wares?

925
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,630
Oh...

926
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,610
Bartering...

927
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,230
Wait, we must make you like me first...

928
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,250
Go ahead...

929
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,610
Do you?

930
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,680
Oh...

931
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,080
Shoot...

932
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,180
Unlucky...

933
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,320
Uh...

934
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,940
I can't argue with that...

935
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,970
Really now...

936
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,170
You're such a charmer...

937
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,770
I'm a charmer...

938
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,890
Uh oh...

939
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,790
Uh oh...

940
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,410
Gosh...

941
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,130
You're a big fat liar...

942
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,130
What a dumb joke...

943
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,230
A phony...

944
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,710
Okay, we went down a little bit...

945
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,090
But...

946
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,750
I'm just getting back into it...

947
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,770
A big phony...

948
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,890
A big fat phony...

949
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,030
Okay, here we go...

950
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,070
You're pathetic...

951
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,030
Oh my god...

952
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,030
Sorry, I don't get it...

953
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,750
Really now...

954
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,890
You win this one...

955
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,650
Okay, we went up one point...

956
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,310
From...

957
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,610
What's with this mustache...

958
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,910
What's with this whole...

959
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,170
Everything...

960
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,890
I'm not...

961
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,390
I'm not one to judge...

962
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,130
People by their appearance and all...

963
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:33,510
But...

964
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,810
If they're rude to me...

965
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:38,170
That's why you're so ugly...

966
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,430
You're a big fat liar...

967
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,050
Ugly...

968
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,850
Inside...

969
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,850
And out...

970
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,450
Oh shoot...

971
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:43,470
I mean...

972
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,270
What a dumb joke...

973
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,070
I messed that up...

974
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,310
That's my bad...

975
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,810
Oh...

976
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,670
Geez...

977
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,870
Sorry, I don't get it...

978
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,070
Cheese Louise...

979
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,770
Please...

980
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,650
I'm embarrassed...

981
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,450
Don't make me...

982
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,170
I can't argue with that...

983
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,690
Okay...

984
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,750
We did that one really well...

985
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,330
That one was super duper lucky...

986
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,170
Okay...

987
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,150
And I can't do anymore...

988
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,440
Cool...

989
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,810
Perfect...

990
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,730
Put your...

991
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,010
Weapon away for a bonus...

992
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,190
Really?

993
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,790
I see...

994
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,150
Yep...

995
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,670
Be seeing you...

996
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,950
My speech craft went up...

997
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,330
A pleasure to speak...

998
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:24,830
Um...

999
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,210
Rumors?

1000
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,990
Rufrius Venetius is good with his fists...

1001
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,610
I've seen him in action...

1002
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,670
And it's impressive...

1003
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,090
Rufrius...

1004
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,730
What's his name?

1005
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,130
Rufrius Venetius is good with his fists...

1006
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,130
You don't even sound like you...

1007
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,410
I'm saying it correctly...

1008
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,170
I've seen him in action...

1009
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,010
And it's impressive...

1010
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,030
Ruf...

1011
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,850
Ruf...

1012
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,450
Ruf...

1013
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,350
Rufrius...

1014
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,010
Wait, let's see if I can make him nice...

1015
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,490
Tell me more...

1016
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,130
Wait...

1017
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,970
He likes me so much more now...

1018
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:52,990
Okay...

1019
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:53,770
We are so good...

1020
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,170
You have reached the maximum disposition for this character...

1021
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,610
Let's go...

1022
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,330
Okay...

1023
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,770
I offer the finest goods and lowest prices in all Cyrodiil...

1024
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,470
Thank you...

1025
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,190
For...

1026
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,390
Who told me...

1027
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:04,790
To...

1028
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,270
Put away my weapon...

1029
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,230
We are so in...

1030
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,110
Okay...

1031
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,790
Alright...

1032
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,690
Um...

1033
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,870
Disposition...

1034
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,670
79...

1035
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,890
Buying items...

1036
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,070
Uh...

1037
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,250
Selling...

1038
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,110
At 55% of value...

1039
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:21,810
No...

1040
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,970
57...

1041
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,690
56%...

1042
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,770
56% of value...

1043
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,450
And I won't budge...

1044
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,270
Okay...

1045
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:30,650
Um...

1046
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,970
Let's see...

1047
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,590
This...

1048
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,670
Sell...

1049
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,270
That's a fair deal...

1050
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:39,530
Ah...

1051
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,850
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1052
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,020
D-d-d-dum.

1053
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,380
Now higher?

1054
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:47,920
Really?

1055
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,100
58!

1056
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,400
And I won't back down.

1057
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,900
This one, this is the dwarven bow is the one that we stole.

1058
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,600
After we killed that man.

1059
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,950
Oh my gosh!

1060
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,290
Okay, um... What else did we take?

1061
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,770
Steal... Oh wait, actually let's go with weight first.

1062
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,690
Okay.

1063
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,410
Keep the dwarven bow?

1064
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:25,830
Oh.

1065
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:26,890
Oops.

1066
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,490
Oh well.

1067
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,990
Dwarven bow was pretty good.

1068
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,690
I like mine though, the shadow hunt.

1069
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,030
Oh my gosh, I have an itch on my leg!

1070
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,510
You can buy

1071
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,640
it back.

1072
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,740
But I don't want... Oh wait, it is pretty good.

1073
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,080
Compared to mine.

1074
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,020
But it's expensive.

1075
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,700
It's fine.

1076
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,080
Okay.

1077
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,020
I think that's everything we took.

1078
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,420
We didn't take that much.

1079
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,540
We didn't really take that much.

1080
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,940
It just... I kind of was like, oh, let's get out of here.

1081
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,120
Potion of cure disease.

1082
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,800
I guess we just gotta go back.

1083
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:13,660
Meh.

1084
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,140
Oh wait!

1085
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,200
We took...

1086
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,940
There was a dagger.

1087
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,640
I remember.

1088
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,320
I was like, oh, I can sell this.

1089
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,780
I have this thing.

1090
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,960
Suffer thorn.

1091
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,540
It's better than the dagger.

1092
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,600
We'll sell these dagger.

1093
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,380
Do I need these boots?

1094
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,580
Did I steal these too?

1095
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,820
Sell potions?

1096
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,340
They're heavy?

1097
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,120
Are they really?

1098
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,640
What's that?

1099
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,460
Well, I mean...

1100
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,180
I guess...

1101
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,560
They're not that heavy!

1102
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,880
They're .5!

1103
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:57,840
That one is better than the dwarven bow, but it's enchanted so the enchantment will wear out unless you're keeping it fed with souls.

1104
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,960
How do I do that?

1105
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,260
They add up quickly.

1106
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,220
I do have like 10 potions of sorcery and I don't even really use magicka.

1107
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:14,880
So...

1108
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,120
Soul gems with souls in them.

1109
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,260
The mage's guild can restock.

1110
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,740
Guys!

1111
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,040
Guys!

1112
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,840
We are so close!

1113
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,360
1000 gold away.

1114
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:35,930
Woohoo!

1115
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:37,770
What else do we got?

1116
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,690
Wait, wait.

1117
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,250
Buy weight, not weight.

1118
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,790
I guess I could sell like half of the potions of healing.

1119
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,190
I have a lot of them.

1120
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,810
But those I will actually use.

1121
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,670
Potion of personality.

1122
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,550
Hahaha!

1123
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,080
Get a personality bub.

1124
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,350
You don't need that?

1125
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,770
What are you saying I'm chiming?

1126
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,930
All on my own?

1127
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,150
You're saying that I'm...

1128
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,130
I'm...

1129
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,610
I have a great personality without even...

1130
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,850
Without even...

1131
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,470
Doing a potion.

1132
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,150
Without even fortifying myself.

1133
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,590
I don't need to cheat code my personality.

1134
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,410
That I'm just a real natural charmer.

1135
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,650
I can't go by.

1136
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,710
Mercantile mastery increase.

1137
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,850
Negotiation, bargaining...

1138
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,310
D... D... D...

1139
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:41,550
Dickering!

1140
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,070
E-Tida!

1141
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,010
This potion of personality, just alcohol.

1142
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,470
You're okay, I guess.

1143
00:47:58,850 --> 00:47:59,730
Charles Dickens.

1144
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,450
Charles Dickens.

1145
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,670
Haggling, they're all means to an end.

1146
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,190
Getting the best price for your goods.

1147
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,230
The damage condition of an item is no longer a factor when you sell it.

1148
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,730
Merchants may also offer you better items.

1149
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,790
I didn't know that the condition was a factor.

1150
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,830
There.

1151
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:16,990
Wow.

1152
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,850
Yay!

1153
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,450
A thing that I...

1154
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,870
Didn't know about.

1155
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,310
Alright.

1156
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,130
Let's go back to that...

1157
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,610
Come back and see me again.

1158
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,690
Thank you, Norbert.

1159
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,250
Goodbye.

1160
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,970
Goodbye.

1161
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,950
Let's go back to that cave.

1162
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,270
And go grab some more armor.

1163
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm gonna hold on to the other potions for now.

1164
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,260
Just...

1165
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,780
Wait, what's mine?

1166
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,560
Actually...

1167
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,000
Okay, we're...

1168
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,300
We're like a little over half of what we could hold, but...

1169
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,820
How are you?

1170
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,340
This town is haunted.

1171
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,900
Wait, are you not...

1172
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,300
The worm?

1173
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,400
Oh, you just asked how I was.

1174
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,060
He likes me now.

1175
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,880
What's your story?

1176
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,920
So...

1177
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,300
We'll just keep stealing armor and coming back.

1178
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:18,830
I think.

1179
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,630
You're growing on him.

1180
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,730
Maybe, like...

1181
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,370
The other guy is his bestie.

1182
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,310
And he was like...

1183
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,610
My bestie is...

1184
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,610
Cool with you.

1185
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,590
I'm cool with you.

1186
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:28,470
You know?

1187
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,210
You had your bow out.

1188
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,310
You really hate that, huh?

1189
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,650
Why can't I just be...

1190
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,650
Prepared for anything?

1191
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,390
You know?

1192
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,030
Maybe that's why.

1193
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,110
Put your bow away and I love you.

1194
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:48,550
Alright.

1195
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,870
Sneak time.

1196
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,390
What is save again?

1197
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,250
F5?

1198
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,110
Right?

1199
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,670
Thank you.

1200
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,030
Sorry.

1201
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,150
It's been a month.

1202
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,450
I'm remembering stuff.

1203
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:09,410
I'm remembering stuff.

1204
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:09,750
No way.

1205
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,750
Why are his hands like that?

1206
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,170
Get it?

1207
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,230
Cuz people ask me.

1208
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,250
Why are my hands like that?

1209
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,170
Just a little...

1210
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:25,830
A little funny.

1211
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,430
Why are...

1212
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,270
Oh, that's a rat.

1213
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,780
My...

1214
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,420
I feel...

1215
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,160
Well, you can't really see it.

1216
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,580
Hold on.

1217
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,360
Let me scoot over.

1218
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,860
My bow is already almost to like...

1219
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,720
Half...

1220
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,120
Enchantment.

1221
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm kind of nervous.

1222
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,100
How do I get a souls gem?

1223
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,790
I looked right at it!

1224
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,030
Oh, golly.

1225
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:15,010
I'll be okay.

1226
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,070
I didn't get hurt.

1227
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:16,690
We're fine.

1228
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:17,150
No!

1229
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:20,790
Oh, okay.

1230
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:21,470
Nothing here.

1231
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,690
Nothing here.

1232
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,280
Wait.

1233
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,120
Okay, fine.

1234
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,580
Do you not have any souls gems?

1235
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,600
I think you can normally steal them from the mages guild.

1236
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,080
Maybe...

1237
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,720
I saw some of you guys say that I have some.

1238
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,880
So maybe...

1239
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,960
How do I...

1240
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,400
How do I...

1241
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,880
Use them then?

1242
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,320
Via...

1243
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,860
How do I use them?

1244
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,200
Can I use them like right here?

1245
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,080
Souls gem...

1246
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,220
Maybe not under alchemy...

1247
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,620
Souls gem...

1248
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,340
All right up here.

1249
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,360
We'll just go in.

1250
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,540
Alphabet...

1251
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:11,600
Wait.

1252
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,340
Oh!

1253
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
Petty soul gem!

1254
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,500
Is that ET?

1255
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,300
It is!

1256
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,160
Well...

1257
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,640
It's ETina!

1258
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,670
You need a soul...

1259
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,790
For this soul gem.

1260
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,010
Those ones are empty.

1261
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,850
What is this?

1262
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,430
Is it a full soul gem?

1263
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,290
Lesser...

1264
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,350
Lesser...

1265
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,170
Soul...

1266
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:45,790
Gem?

1267
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,030
These places still scare the...

1268
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,430
Scare me.

1269
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,430
I don't like it.

1270
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,230
This is why I've been putting it off for so long.

1271
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,370
I get freaked out in these places, you guys.

1272
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,930
I'm not meant for the...

1273
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,390
Dungeon cave dwelling life.

1274
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:09,810
I'm...

1275
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:10,550
I'm a lady.

1276
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,070
I don't hear anyone walking.

1277
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,430
What's in here?

1278
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,990
The Great Dome.

1279
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,990
I'm too freaked out by these places.

1280
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,790
I don't like going in by myself.

1281
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,190
I get scared.

1282
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,070
Okay.

1283
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,270
Careful.

1284
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,110
Easy.

1285
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,350
I don't want to fall down there.

1286
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,590
Okay, never mind.

1287
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,750
Not easy.

1288
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:03,850
Up...

1289
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,830
Upsy daisy.

1290
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,970
I'm going in further and further.

1291
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,900
That makes me even more nervous that there's nobody around.

1292
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,750
What if I encounter a ghost?

1293
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:33,650
A...

1294
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,000
Ghost!

1295
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,200
You gotta chat with you?

1296
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,240
Yeah.

1297
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,540
Be my...

1298
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,600
Be my...

1299
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,580
Um...

1300
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,060
My...

1301
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,800
What's the word?

1302
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,780
Where's all the people that I can steal the armor from?

1303
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,380
Wait.

1304
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,460
I'll take this, chill.

1305
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,210
Be my...

1306
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,990
Be my...

1307
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,770
My moral support!

1308
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:18,990
What?

1309
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,030
Where the heck is this going?

1310
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:38,750
Gold!

1311
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,680
Look who we've got here.

1312
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,420
Oh, shoot.

1313
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,940
The other girl just goes, huh?

1314
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:51,960
Huh?

1315
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,740
If she was here a second ago...

1316
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,280
Money!

1317
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,160
Your presence here will not be tolerated.

1318
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,500
Where are you?

1319
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,880
Where did you go?

1320
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,760
Well, well, look who we've got here.

1321
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,960
Where are you?

1322
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,660
Where are you?

1323
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,880
Where are you?

1324
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,480
Got her!

1325
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,120
Okay.

1326
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,960
Nice!

1327
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,880
Nice, nice.

1328
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,240
Alright.

1329
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,000
Take that.

1330
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,960
Um...

1331
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,300
I know she missed a couple more times.

1332
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,140
Guess there's nobody else here.

1333
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,280
Nice.

1334
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,840
You guys are just chilling down here?

1335
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,300
Take your...

1336
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,740
Linens!

1337
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,380
Wait, what if I take her linens?

1338
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,360
Gotta use a soul trap spell on a creature.

1339
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,860
Kill it, then use the soul as fuel from the...

1340
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,280
For the...

1341
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,140
From the soul gem.

1342
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,660
You can also use a welkin soul...

1343
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,020
Stone.

1344
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,500
Ah, yeah, but...

1345
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,440
Will it...

1346
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:02,780
That...

1347
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,040
I was told to keep those.

1348
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,660
I think for some quest, eventually.

1349
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,500
That bow is a shotgun.

1350
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,640
You blasted that first guy into the wall.

1351
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,220
Hatsumito!

1352
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:12,720
My...

1353
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:13,820
Gamerslips...

1354
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,820
Mito mousepad came in.

1355
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,600
Ah!

1356
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,240
I'm glad!

1357
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,840
Thank you for ordering it!

1358
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,460
Also, Ducky, thank you for the gifted.

1359
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,020
Should I take the dagger, too?

1360
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,560
We can always...

1361
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,240
We can always...

1362
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,660
Ditch it if...

1363
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,320
Eventually...

1364
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,660
We have too much...

1365
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,060
On hand, you know?

1366
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,160
Wow!

1367
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,260
That one's worth a lot.

1368
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,640
Wait, what is my health at, anyway?

1369
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,400
Oh!

1370
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,940
Perfect.

1371
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,760
Okay!

1372
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,220
Silver!

1373
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,440
Silver arrow...

1374
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Silver arrow...

1375
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,420
What's my inventory?

1376
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,440
Yuck and Ike...

1377
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,260
Okay, we got 50.

1378
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,950
Silver...

1379
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,290
Fancy, baby!

1380
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,690
Silver bow!

1381
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:08,650
What do you have?

1382
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:09,330
Anything?

1383
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,390
I love a lizard lady.

1384
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,790
Silver arrows work on ghosts.

1385
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,210
Oh!

1386
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,670
I was gonna ask...

1387
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,590
How do I defeat them?

1388
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:24,890
How many...

1389
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,770
Let's see, should I switch to the silver arrows?

1390
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,410
I have a lot of iron arrows.

1391
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,290
I guess I could get rid of some of them now...

1392
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,590
Since we're...

1393
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,350
Well...

1394
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,410
I don't have so many...

1395
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,750
Steel...

1396
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,130
I'll...

1397
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,170
I'll save the...

1398
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,690
I'll do the steel until...

1399
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,450
Maybe we encounter some ghosts...

1400
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,090
But I can't...

1401
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,450
I can't stay for too long now...

1402
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,270
Cause I...

1403
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,110
I looted too much!

1404
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,870
Oh, whoops.

1405
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:00,610
I said it was empty.

1406
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,130
I'm stupid.

1407
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,070
The music is so...

1408
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:21,970
Indiana Jones...

1409
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,330
To me.

1410
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,610
Yeah, we're going into the...

1411
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,570
Into the dome.

1412
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:34,810
Okay.

1413
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,090
I'm scared.

1414
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:53,760
No!

1415
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,800
There's multiple people!

1416
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,600
Uh-oh.

1417
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,200
My bow is really about to be not enchanted anymore.

1418
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,420
Okay.

1419
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,470
Dang it.

1420
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:25,390
What...

1421
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,990
Where'd you go?

1422
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,910
Where did he go?

1423
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,730
Where did he go?

1424
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,190
...prevalent into Somerset Isle?

1425
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,770
It seems...

1426
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,390
...Somerset Isle...

1427
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,570
...has become a much more dangerous place...

1428
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,410
...and be seeing you.

1429
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,210
Hello!

1430
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:43,770
Good afternoon.

1431
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,950
The Imperial city is located on a...

1432
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,090
...large island...

1433
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,550
...surrounded by Lake Rumar.

1434
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:49,730
Really?

1435
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,610
What's the news...

1436
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,490
Yes...

1437
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:56,890
Yes...

1438
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:58,770
Yes...

1439
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,010
Yes...

1440
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,170
Yes!

1441
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,510
I still got it.

1442
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,170
I still got it!

1443
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,970
Can they see my bow?

1444
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,370
Okay, there we go.

1445
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,150
I think he's broken!

1446
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,310
Oh, he's not broken anymore, okay.

1447
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:48,930
Oh shoot.

1448
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:52,850
Where'd he go?

1449
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,630
Where'd he go?

1450
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,390
Where'd he go?

1451
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,570
Where'd he go?

1452
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,330
Where'd he go?

1453
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:02,430
Where?

1454
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,150
Hello?

1455
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,380
Oh shoot.

1456
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,030
Wait a second!

1457
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,150
You guys, this is huge!

1458
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,990
Oh my god!

1459
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,490
This is huge!

1460
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,030
Cave diver's helmet.

1461
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,770
Wait, this is huge!

1462
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,050
This is huge!

1463
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,970
His little clogs!

1464
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,730
Big money!

1465
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,790
I don't know if I can take the boots.

1466
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,050
Hold on.

1467
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,990
I'm over encumbered.

1468
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:55,710
Okay.

1469
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,510
Let's see.

1470
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,470
What can we throw away that's not worth a bajillion dollars?

1471
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:06,550
Oh!

1472
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,450
There we go.

1473
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,150
Holy moly!

1474
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,070
Okay.

1475
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,470
Uh...

1476
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,490
This should be enough for us to...

1477
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,750
To buy our house!

1478
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:17,050
No!

1479
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,370
Use the repair hammers!

1480
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,550
Oh, that's a good idea, right?

1481
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,330
We can use it on our bow.

1482
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,190
Where are they?

1483
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,230
Repair hammers.

1484
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:26,750
Oh, here we go.

1485
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,570
Oh!

1486
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:28,490
The stolen ones!

1487
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:29,690
I'll use first.

1488
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:30,270
Yeah!

1489
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:32,570
Oh, wait!

1490
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:34,910
This...

1491
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,090
I should repair it to full capacity, no?

1492
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,830
Only an apprentice armorer.

1493
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,530
Just kidding.

1494
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,010
Okay.

1495
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,030
Oh, wait.

1496
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,250
Uh-oh!

1497
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,170
Uh-oh!

1498
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:47,250
Uh-oh!

1499
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,050
Hmm.

1500
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:55,630
Oh...

1501
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,570
Oh, yeah, it doesn't matter if we're selling anymore.

1503
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,190
You literally told me that earlier, huh?

1504
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:00,550
Oh...

1505
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,830
I can't even repair my bow.

1506
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,830
You can level armor by repairing everything.

1507
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:11,730
Oh, interesting.

1508
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,550
Well, I'll just repair...

1509
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,350
This.

1510
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:16,630
I kinda wanted to get rid of...

1511
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:21,030
Them anyway, because they were stolen, and I don't want them to be like, We're taking your stolen goods!

1512
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,270
You know?

1513
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:22,790
Okay.

1514
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:23,930
What do we do?

1515
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,650
Okay.

1516
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,330
Let's get rid of...

1517
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:31,570
Uh...

1518
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,530
There was, like, some boots.

1519
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,050
The iron...

1520
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:37,990
Whoa!

1521
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:38,630
No!

1522
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,550
That's not what I wanted to do.

1523
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,730
I'm so sorry, everybody.

1524
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:44,810
Um...

1525
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:45,190
Hold on.

1526
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,750
How do I...

1527
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:48,670
Hold

1528
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:53,830
on!

1529
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,810
One moment, please.

1530
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,410
Put back on...

1531
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,070
Tina!

1532
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:01,410
You put your armor back on right now!

1533
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,230
Right this instant!

1534
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,870
Okay, we're good.

1535
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,150
How do I drop stuff again?

1536
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,430
I can't remember how to drop things.

1537
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,450
Oh, shoot.

1538
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:16,030
Um...

1539
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,590
I have some grapes.

1540
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,650
I can get rid of...

1541
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:24,430
Right...

1542
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:25,230
Right click.

1543
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,230
Ew, I forgot about the boots.

1544
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,070
No, I didn't!

1545
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:29,870
I didn't forget about the boots!

1546
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:30,650
Hold on!

1547
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:31,850
Here we go, here we go.

1548
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,650
No, not right click.

1549
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,070
What is it?

1550
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,270
Control...

1551
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,170
Oh, I see.

1552
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,410
Shift, left, drop.

1553
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,670
Got it.

1554
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,950
Literally says at the bottom.

1555
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,150
I'm speaking for my friend who is too busy to watch your live streams.

1556
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:48,570
Oh, no!

1557
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:53,090
He became a VTuber, so they don't have time to watch you.

1558
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,150
Congrats on your friend becoming a VTuber!

1559
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,450
She also dropped the iron armor.

1560
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,770
But it's worth so much money!

1561
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,360
I guess we'll get a lot of money.

1562
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:11,980
From the helmet.

1563
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,530
Okay, we'll drop...

1564
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,480
Wait.

1565
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,880
We can drop one.

1566
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,000
And then we just need to only drop six.

1567
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,200
More pounds.

1568
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:23,680
Okay.

1569
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,510
E-Tina's intense workout regime.

1570
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,580
Let's see.

1571
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,340
Routine.

1572
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,760
Okay.

1573
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,280
What's something that we can get rid of?

1574
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,300
I guess we could also get rid of the silver bow.

1575
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,600
It's not worth that much either.

1576
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:47,110
Your greed is weighing you down.

1577
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,010
I know!

1578
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,910
You think I want to be this way?

1579
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,450
You think I want to be this way?

1580
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:05,010
There are more enemies to loot that may have better gear.

1581
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,450
I feel like I can just leave though.

1582
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:07,170
This is...

1583
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,010
This dwarven...

1584
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,690
...stuff is so heavy.

1585
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,330
So, so heavy.

1586
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,230
I guess we can get rid of this.

1587
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:15,830
No!

1588
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:16,990
That's not what I wanted to do.

1589
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,230
Gosh, look at her legs.

1590
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,610
I keep doing this.

1591
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:23,870
Okay.

1592
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:24,530
Shift.

1593
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,050
Drop the bows.

1594
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,690
Put on...

1595
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,570
The armor.

1596
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,350
I guess I'll drop it.

1597
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,430
There might be...

1598
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,150
Maybe...

1599
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,570
There's somebody with good...

1600
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,510
Good...

1601
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:42,930
Um...

1602
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,550
Oops!

1603
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,330
Nobody heard that, right?

1604
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,110
I'm afraid there's one more person here.

1605
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,060
It sounded like three people were talking.

1606
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,660
Where did he go?

1607
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,540
We lost him.

1608
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,210
That scared me.

1609
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,410
That scared me.

1610
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,570
Holy cow!

1611
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,610
Okay, hold on.

1612
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,570
It's all thanks to my...

1613
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,450
Good armor though.

1614
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,090
Okay.

1615
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:56,610
There we go.

1616
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,290
Quick save.

1617
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:57,750
Alright.

1618
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,570
Nothing to worry about, I guess.

1619
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,850
Just my eyes playing tricks on me.

1620
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:09,450
Ah!

1621
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:09,570
Ah!

1622
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:13,650
Oh shoot.

1623
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:16,210
Ah!

1624
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,030
Oh my gosh!

1625
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:17,750
I can't get him!

1626
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,350
Ah!

1627
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:20,590
Goodness gracious.

1628
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,090
Uh oh, my...

1629
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,050
Arrow...

1630
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,610
Or my bow is not enchanted anymore.

1631
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:26,450
But I make...

1632
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:29,530
Where?

1633
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,090
Ah!

1634
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,850
Shoot.

1635
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,900
You die!

1636
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,420
Oh shoot.

1637
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,880
What's the matter getting tired?

1638
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,680
Oh, okay.

1639
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,000
Alright.

1640
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,340
Alright.

1641
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:50,620
Yes.

1642
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,280
Holy cow.

1643
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,820
Okay, this guy is gonna be...

1644
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,220
Yeah, give me all your stuff.

1645
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,920
Give me your dwarven things.

1646
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,780
I'm just...

1647
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,840
I'm stripping you naked.

1648
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,800
Uh oh, I'm over encumbered.

1649
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:02,260
Okay.

1650
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,640
Let's get rid of stuff.

1651
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,120
Uhhh...

1652
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,060
What can I get rid of?

1653
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:12,840
Ah!

1654
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,100
Tree Bobber!

1655
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,100
It's gonna be my birthday in two days!

1656
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,460
But I'm not gonna be online then.

1657
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,880
Can I ask for a premature happy birthday?

1658
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,080
I'm certain that I'll manage to survive the two days until then.

1659
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:21,640
Okay.

1660
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,240
I'm...

1661
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,420
It's not jinxing it.

1662
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,620
Happy birthday!

1663
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,220
Happy birthday, Tree Bobber!

1664
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,180
Dwarf Armor!

1665
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,460
Yeah, Dwarf Armor is super heavy, but it's...

1666
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,780
Super...

1667
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:35,540
Expensive.

1668
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,200
Hey!

1669
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,720
Let's get rid of these daggers.

1670
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,040
They are not...

1671
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,220
Very heavy, but...

1672
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,680
Oh gosh, I have to get rid of 30 pounds worth of stuff.

1673
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:52,300
Um...

1674
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,990
I think I'm gonna have to abandon something.

1675
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,090
I'm gonna have to abandon something.

1676
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:16,950
Maybe the boots...

1677
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:19,170
And...

1678
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,410
No, that's only 20.

1679
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,110
Ah!

1680
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:27,050
Wait, what do these add up to?

1681
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:27,570
One...

1682
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:27,870
Hold on.

1683
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,370
We're gonna...

1684
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,010
We're doing real math here.

1685
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:38,090
115 times 3 is 345, which is less than the 400 that is the cure-ass.

1686
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,090
So...

1687
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,270
I say we...

1688
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:40,930
Get rid of the 3.

1689
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,710
Look at the Daedra hearts.

1690
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,350
They heal me.

1691
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,370
They're only worth 2.

1692
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,430
I guess that's 20, huh?

1693
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,490
You know what?

1694
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,210
You're so right.

1695
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:57,510
Goodbye.

1696
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,390
Goodbye.

1697
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,730
Alright, now we just need to get rid of 8.

1698
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,870
So if I get rid of...

1699
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:06,730
The gauntlets...

1700
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:08,770
Ah!

1701
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,010
Dang it, I did it again!

1702
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,110
Get out of here!

1703
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:14,690
Get out of here!

1704
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,190
Okay!

1705
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,470
Whispering, drop the iron cure-ass.

1706
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:21,890
Wait, where is it?

1707
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,510
I don't even see it.

1708
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,230
Huh?

1709
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,810
Do I have that?

1710
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:34,690
I don't...

1711
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,010
I got rid of it already!

1712
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:37,670
I don't have that!

1713
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:38,970
You're crazy!

1714
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,450
There is no iron one in here.

1715
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,580
We need a flashbang emote.

1716
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:55,860
Okay.

1717
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,020
Nice.

1718
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,340
Take my arrow back.

1719
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,660
What the heck is a rock shatter?

1720
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,460
When the vow breaks...

1721
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,340
I've come across an unusual mace named Rock Shatter.

1722
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:21,460
On the body of a Nord, the mace has a worn inscription on the haft reading to Maeva and...

1723
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,260
Bajalfi.

1724
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,340
In honor of your union.

1725
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,640
I should hang onto this weapon.

1726
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,320
I'm sure Maeva will want to know her late husband's fate.

1727
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,560
Who's Maeva?

1728
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,960
Wait, am I over encumbered again?

1729
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,220
Gosh, dang it!

1730
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,320
It's too heavy!

1731
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,400
I should hold on to this.

1732
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,660
Immediately drops it.

1733
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,560
Wait, I'm barely...

1734
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,000
That's so unfair.

1735
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:47,740
Okay, hold on.

1736
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,560
We can get rid of like...

1737
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,520
Where's my...

1738
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:51,860
Where's my arrows?

1739
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,120
Here we go.

1740
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,160
Let's get rid of like...

1741
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:58,560
Like...

1742
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,160
50 of them.

1743
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:12,650
Now we're good.

1744
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,010
My bad I'm crazy.

1745
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:15,490
Yeah, I've dropped it!

1746
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,050
It's okay.

1747
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,350
You haven't fed your horses in three days?

1748
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:21,370
Okay.

1749
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,470
It sucks I'm going to go check this lady, but I know that I won't be able to take anything.

1750
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,870
Well, she also doesn't have that much stuff anyway, so...

1751
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,810
Let's get out of here.

1752
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,130
Let's go sell all this stuff.

1753
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:39,830
And...

1754
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,790
Let's become rich and buy a house.

1755
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,850
Yippee!

1756
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:54,790
Okay.

1757
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:54,850
Okay.

1758
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,690
I don't remember how to leave.

1759
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,570
Not that way.

1760
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,050
This way.

1761
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,110
Oh, I remember how to leave.

1762
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,590
I haven't gone that way, but...

1763
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,230
We can check that on the way...

1764
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,430
When we come in again.

1765
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,130
Oh my gosh!

1766
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,110
We're home owners!

1767
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,040
Oh my gosh!

1768
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,160
What made that sounds?

1769
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:53,500
Was that... Tina?

1770
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,790
What is it now?

1771
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:02,850
I just...

1772
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:03,830
Wait...

1773
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,370
What?

1774
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,590
What's happening?

1775
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,120
What was...

1776
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,380
Someone was getting attacked, I think.

1777
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:28,950
Eh?

1778
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,540
What was that?

1779
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:33,620
What?

1780
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,320
It came from over here?

1781
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,360
I think?

1782
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
Mud crab fight?

1783
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,300
You think that's what that was?

1784
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,120
You think someone died to a mud crab?

1785
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,220
It was... We first heard the... Right here.

1786
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,370
The first one was you.

1787
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,530
But that sounded like a man.

1788
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:06,390
No?

1789
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:10,270
That was the most like... Voice.

1790
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,750
Tina is a... She's...

1791
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,250
She's got a dainty voice.

1792
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:16,210
And then I kept hearing it happening.

1793
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:24,790
Even when I was... What a mystery.

1794
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,530
It kept happening though.

1795
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,410
You guys heard it, no?

1796
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,230
It's not bad.

1797
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,070
What?

1798
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,410
I said it's not bad.

1799
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,010
Rufus Venetius is good with his fists.

1800
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,530
I've seen him in action and it's impressive.

1801
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:59,050
This guy is getting around everywhere with his fists, huh?

1802
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,090
What are they standing around for?

1803
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:11,290
Alright.

1804
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:13,770
Alright.

1805
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,130
Let's sell and become rich.

1806
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:17,470
Do you still like us?

1807
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,210
A pleasure to speak with you.

1808
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,310
You still like us, Norbert?

1809
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,030
Take your time.

1810
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,050
82.

1811
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:28,530
I think that's about... Can I interest you in some of my wares?

1812
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:29,990
I think that's what it was about before.

1813
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:31,810
Let's try 59.

1814
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:34,990
Alright.

1815
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:35,650
Here we go!

1816
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,050
Wait.

1817
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,090
Should I hold on to this cave diver's helmet?

1818
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,490
Can I even use it?

1819
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,910
Because it says I can have water breathing.

1820
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,470
Anyway.

1821
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,130
Let's sell this.

1822
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,520
Yes!

1823
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,820
I'm gonna try 60.

1824
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,280
Let's sell this.

1825
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,800
A fine transaction.

1826
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,480
Let's try 61.

1827
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,660
This?

1828
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,640
62.

1829
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,240
Oh my gosh!

1830
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,420
You guys, look how close we are!

1831
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:43,920
Oh my gosh!

1832
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:44,820
63.

1833
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:51,150
63.

1834
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,190
An excellent bargain.

1835
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:54,950
64.

1836
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,830
I'm gonna be broke for 5!

1837
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:11,670
5!

1838
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,530
What else did I grab?

1839
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:24,450
I can't remember.

1840
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,730
Is there anything else I grabbed?

1841
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:33,870
I grabbed the pearl.

1842
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:34,850
The pearl?

1843
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,250
I'm gonna get rid of those.

1844
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:42,010
We have our Lusia Argonian maid.

1845
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:47,810
Pleasure to serve you.

1846
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:48,410
Thank you!

1847
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,830
Goodbye!

1848
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:50,510
Goodbye!

1849
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:53,230
Nice!

1850
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:55,430
Alright.

1851
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:00,410
Let's go get ourselves a haunted house, baby!

1852
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,070
Wee!

1853
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,490
Holy cow!

1854
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,030
Is that the guy?

1855
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,430
The children are starving.

1856
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:11,890
Hello.

1857
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:12,750
Please help.

1858
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,550
Everybody's talking about the prophet.

1859
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:15,490
Go ahead.

1860
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,310
After the attack on the chapel, people are inclined to believe almost anything.

1861
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,550
Today's your lucky day.

1862
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,070
Is that so?

1863
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,690
So let's hear it.

1864
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:23,470
Everybody's talking about it.

1865
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,710
Everybody's talking about it.

1866
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:24,850
What?

1867
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,190
I can't bring attention.

1868
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:27,330
My god.

1869
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,250
Alright.

1870
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,410
The voices.

1871
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,550
Okay.

1872
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:39,970
Ikimasu.

1873
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,470
All the same voice actor too.

1874
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,050
The voices!

1875
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:46,990
Hello there.

1876
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:47,550
Hello.

1877
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,950
Hear me!

1878
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,050
Oh, people of Syracuse!

1879
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:53,010
You will be my...

1880
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:53,350
Gosh!

1881
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:54,930
This is a really nice house.

1882
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:56,010
We've got a little...

1883
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,290
Look how romantic the balcony is.

1884
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,070
We can just go on top and...

1885
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:02,550
Kind of stare wistfully into the...

1886
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:03,970
You know...

1887
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,850
Into the...

1888
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,050
Into the world.

1889
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:07,870
And just think like...

1890
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:08,050
Ah!

1891
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,140
Aw, yeah!

1892
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,640
It was...

1893
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,320
Here?

1894
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:30,590
The Count's...

1895
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:30,790
Arms.

1896
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:32,350
Wait.

1897
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:33,090
There?

1898
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,130
Oh, yeah.

1899
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:35,570
I was so close.

1900
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,230
Okay.

1901
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:43,170
Hello!

1902
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:43,870
Hello, good lady.

1903
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:44,690
Wait a second.

1904
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,290
Who are you?

1905
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:46,830
Jesson Sextius.

1906
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:50,070
Singer, composer, and storyteller extraordinaire.

1907
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:51,530
Glad to meet you.

1908
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,630
I'm not glad to meet you.

1909
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:54,710
Good day.

1910
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,150
Oh, there you are.

1911
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:56,350
What is it?

1912
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,290
You, you, you.

1913
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,130
Manor is still for sale if you're interested.

1914
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,610
Another Sextius.

1915
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,270
Gosh.

1916
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,170
They're living up to their name.

1917
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:09,030
If you want to buy Benorist Manor, it's still available for a modest price.

1918
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,430
Is that really a modest price in this game?

1919
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:12,610
5,000 gold?

1920
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:13,190
Interested?

1921
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:14,270
I don't know.

1922
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,310
I don't know.

1923
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,390
It seems pretty steep, no?

1924
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,270
It is.

1925
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,630
The other cheapest is 10K.

1926
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,130
Oh, really?

1927
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:27,750
Okay.

1928
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:29,070
Excellent.

1929
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:32,230
Here's the key to the front door and the deed of ownership.

1930
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,430
I hope you enjoy your new home.

1931
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,110
It took seven parts, everybody, but we're finally here.

1932
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:39,330
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must attend to those pressing matters I spoke of earlier.

1933
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,010
Good day.

1934
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,810
Good day!

1935
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,540
You wear the shadows well, fellow thief.

1936
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,000
Oh.

1937
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,560
You're a fellow thief.

1938
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:50,960
Oh.

1939
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:52,500
Goodbye.

1940
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,460
Shadow hide you.

1941
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,700
There's a man sitting right there that heard everything you said.

1942
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,280
He's gonna go report us.

1943
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,440
I bought a house!

1944
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,900
I bought a house.

1945
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,360
I bought a house.

1946
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,000
I bought a house.

1947
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,520
A haunted house.

1948
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,080
A haunted house.

1949
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:09,460
A haunted house.

1950
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,880
Oh my gosh, it's a spirit property.

1951
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:11,860
What happened here?

1952
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,240
Why is it haunted?

1953
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,340
Consider the difference in price between weapons and houses in the US.

1954
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,500
What do you mean?

1955
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,700
Here we go.

1956
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,530
I hope it's furnished.

1957
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:33,210
I've arrived at my new house in Anvil Beneris Manor.

1958
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:36,210
Looks like the place may need some work, but it was a great deal.

1959
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,310
I just couldn't pass up.

1960
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:39,170
I can now make myself at home.

1961
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:40,790
Oh.

1962
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,430
Why is there a...

1963
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:44,370
Why?

1964
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:45,190
Right there.

1965
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,330
Why a table right there?

1966
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,450
Oh.

1967
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,170
Oh.

1968
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:52,770
Oh.

1969
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:53,330
Oh.

1970
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,910
Vintage 399.

1971
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:06,290
Door.

1972
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:08,930
Oh.

1973
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,450
What is...

1974
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,010
Is that a chandelier?

1975
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,050
Okay.

1976
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:21,990
A little bit of an odd layout, but...

1977
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:24,210
How long has this meat been in here?

1978
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:28,310
Did you make sure to get an inspection before closing?

1979
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:30,850
I trust my gut.

1980
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,150
Video games that you experience things you can't realize.

1981
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:34,670
Stop!

1982
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,870
It costs quite a bit more to furnish.

1983
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:38,370
Really?

1984
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,110
It's haunted.

1985
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,290
You're literally a ghost me.

1986
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:42,510
I'm not a ghost in the game.

1987
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,130
I'm an...

1988
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:44,750
I'm an elf in the game, okay?

1989
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,290
Can I...

1990
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,390
That nice natural lighting?

1991
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:54,010
Some more Tamika Vintage 399?

1992
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,490
Damn, Tamika's been busy.

1993
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,910
Now, how do I see the ghost?

1994
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,670
Gosh, sorry.

1995
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:02,470
Okay.

1996
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:06,070
I spooked myself accidentally.

1997
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,690
Our very own bed?

1998
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,890
That's our bed?

1999
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,950
It's nobody else's bed.

2000
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,770
It's literally ours.

2001
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,840
And then this must be...

2002
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,680
Oh, yes.

2003
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,980
This must be the balcony.

2004
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,420
And now we stay...

2005
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,320
We stand up here as the...

2006
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,840
As the wistful maiden of Anvil.

2007
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:46,960
Everyone, there's legends about her.

2008
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,380
They say that she's so beautiful.

2009
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:54,400
That every man wants her, but she will accept no one.

2010
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,920
And that she just...

2011
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,540
Stares off into the distance...

2012
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,380
Waiting for someone to fulfill her quest...

2013
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,500
Of...

2014
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,560
5,000 gold.

2015
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,780
She wants her money back.

2016
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,690
I said...

2017
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:16,170
I said...

2018
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,810
Surely, my...

2019
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,830
Sighs will catch the attention of...

2020
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,630
Some...

2021
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:26,630
Someone...

2022
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,190
They just couldn't hear me.

2023
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:40,410
Yeah.

2024
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:45,690
They just...

2025
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,830
They just couldn't hear, you know?

2026
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:47,850
I get it.

2027
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,030
How do I...

2028
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,910
Get furniture and like clean...

2029
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,410
How do I clean this place up?

2030
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,130
Like, how do I pick up stuff...

2031
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:58,190
To...

2032
01:27:58,650 --> 01:27:59,110
To...

2033
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:00,470
Straighten it up?

2034
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,330
I can pay an installment, right?

2035
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,830
I can pay an installment, right?

2036
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,190
This place is kind of bizarre.

2037
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:08,690
It's like...

2038
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,430
Very...

2039
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:11,350
It's not an open layout at all.

2040
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,890
It's all completely linear.

2041
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,490
You just go from room...

2042
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:15,470
To next room...

2043
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:17,650
To next room...

2044
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:17,970
Oh, wait!

2045
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:19,190
I missed the door.

2046
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,070
Is this a basement?

2047
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:26,590
What are you sighing about, fair maiden?

2048
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,750
I spent all this money on this house and...

2049
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,130
Who lit those?

2050
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,510
Oh, wallet-o, wallet-o.

2051
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,470
Where art thou, wallet-o?

2052
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:45,910
Oh...

2053
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,610
You got ants?

2054
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,250
I think those were worse than ants.

2055
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,930
How good this place comes with spoons.

2056
01:28:58,190 --> 01:28:59,390
Dang, this is huge!

2057
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,680
Some corn!

2058
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,180
This place was made for me.

2059
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,260
A light-o.

2060
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:41,780
Sealed portal!

2061
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,030
Open?

2062
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:47,510
Open.

2063
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,270
Open.

2064
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,910
Open.

2065
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:57,650
It won't open.

2066
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:01,810
Spend the night here?

2067
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,330
It's my home, of course I will.

2068
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:06,670
What's the magic word?

2069
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:07,610
Shasmin!

2070
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,170
Where does it go?

2071
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:15,950
Where does it go?

2072
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:16,310
Portal 2?

2073
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:20,090
Portal 3?

2074
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,270
Portal 3 is real?

2075
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,030
Okay, let's sleep for...

2076
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,250
12 hours.

2077
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:26,390
We're actually...

2078
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,910
10 hours.

2079
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:32,550
Oh!

2080
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,190
Wait!

2081
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,470
They're actually attacking me!

2082
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,310
Oh my god.

2083
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,250
Wait!

2084
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:36,930
Ah!

2085
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:37,730
Ah!

2086
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:38,650
Ah!

2087
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:39,550
Wah!

2088
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:40,710
Wah!

2089
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,800
Oh my god!

2090
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,200
Um...

2091
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,560
I can't...

2092
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:53,280
Let's see...

2093
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,820
My bow is not enchanted anymore.

2094
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,180
But I can use silver bullets, right?

2095
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:01,900
Silver bullets?

2096
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,700
Silver arrows!

2097
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,320
Do you know those guys?

2098
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,940
Not every ghost knows each other.

2099
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,640
Get Wawa's vacuum!

2100
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,500
They're still here, right?

2101
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,300
Oh yes.

2102
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,020
Yes they are.

2103
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:20,820
Hello?

2104
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:22,660
Hello?

2105
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:22,960
Oh!

2106
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:23,500
They see me.

2107
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,260
Hello?

2108
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,320
This is my home!

2109
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,660
This house ain't big enough for three ghosts.

2110
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:36,460
Four ghosts.

2111
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,850
Someone said silver arrows will work.

2112
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:47,870
I don't know.

2113
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:49,050
Maybe I got one guide.

2114
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:49,650
Who knows?

2115
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,870
Make them pay rent.

2116
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,010
Are they coming?

2117
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:00,750
They're just chilling in my room.

2118
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,400
It's worth...

2119
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,280
A shot!

2120
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,520
Oucha!

2121
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:12,780
Oops, shoot.

2122
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:16,100
Oucha!

2123
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,020
Oh gosh, they're tough.

2124
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,420
See, this is what you're getting when you mess with me.

2125
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,160
Holy cow.

2126
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,440
Oh sh...

2127
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,280
If I had aim...

2128
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,160
This would work.

2129
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,960
Okay, we got one.

2130
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:35,640
Rid of one...

2131
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:35,980
Ouch!

2132
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:37,720
Rid of one guy.

2133
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,420
Rid of two guys.

2134
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:44,420
They're ectoplasm.

2135
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:57,930
Wait, so...

2136
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:59,210
Will they come back every night?

2137
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:00,330
Or...

2138
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:09,770
I was awakened by ghosts that attacked me as I slept.

2139
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:12,150
As I awoke, I thought I heard a crash from downstairs.

2140
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:13,410
I should search the house...

2141
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:15,850
And investigate...

2142
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:16,970
Oh no, I'm not trying to sit.

2143
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,170
No, no.

2144
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:19,630
Get up.

2145
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:20,690
Get up.

2146
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:21,230
Get up.

2147
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:21,750
How do I...

2148
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:22,650
Wait, get up.

2149
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,010
Wait, uh...

2150
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:24,210
No, no.

2151
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:24,810
Get up.

2152
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:26,410
Someone's...

2153
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:27,410
How do I stand?

2154
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:31,990
E?

2155
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,210
Oh, thank you.

2156
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:34,950
You...

2157
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:36,410
Showed those...

2158
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,170
Spooky...

2159
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,070
Yeah, I did...

2160
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,210
Wait.

2161
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:40,530
Ectoplasm.

2162
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:42,910
Is...

2163
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,810
Is this gonna disappear?

2164
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:44,750
Or...

2165
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:50,430
I sure left a little mess, huh?

2166
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:52,530
We got some ectoplasm.

2167
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:53,050
Yummy, yum.

2168
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:55,250
Oh!

2169
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:57,490
Skeletal hand.

2170
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:00,930
Uh...

2171
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,730
I thought it was going to be the portal downstairs.

2172
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,350
I didn't realize it was this thing.

2173
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,190
Whoops.

2174
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:11,530
Oh!

2175
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:14,050
Scrap from Lorgrin's Diary.

2176
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,590
I found a skeletal hand next to a page from a diary.

2177
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,450
Wait, wait!

2178
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,050
Uh...

2179
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:19,630
Spoilers!

2180
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,730
I'm trying to read the...

2181
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:25,230
The diary makes mention of a secret room in the house that only a true blooded...

2182
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:26,430
Venerys can open.

2183
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,710
I'm going to need to talk to Velwyn about this.

2184
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,370
I may have to ask around town to find out.

2185
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,390
Where he's gone.

2186
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:36,290
Reading someone's diary?

2187
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:38,150
Well, they left their hand in here, too.

2188
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,850
I think we're already on a pretty...

2189
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,450
Um...

2190
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,590
A pretty, uh...

2191
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:45,550
Intimate level.

2192
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:49,810
And I think I can read their diary if they, you know...

2193
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:53,890
The people of Anvil are worms!

2194
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,750
Whoa!

2195
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:58,110
How dare they criticize what they don't understand!

2196
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:02,190
I shall have my vengeance in a form they cannot possibly imagine!

2197
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:06,530
I shall use the souls of the departed to prolong my own life!

2198
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,330
The tomb is very specific.

2199
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:10,210
I must have more bodies!

2200
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:11,270
Yes!

2201
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:13,350
More bodies!

2202
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:15,630
Wilhelm is not alone!

2203
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:16,510
Wait!

2204
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:17,690
Is he...

2205
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,570
The real beller...

2206
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:20,530
Bell...

2207
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:20,730
Bell...

2208
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:22,430
Bellerino that we need for the home?

2209
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:26,570
Sun's Dawn E...

2210
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,410
3...

2211
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:27,830
3...

2212
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,230
3...

2213
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,330
3...

2214
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:43,950
Plane of existence!

2215
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:46,310
Is there gonna be like a boss fight in my basement?

2216
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,630
Only a true blooded...

2217
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:50,350
Ben...

2218
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:51,650
Benerish...

2219
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:53,030
May open the portal.

2220
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:54,710
So if I fail...

2221
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:56,350
However unlikely that may be...

2222
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:00,310
A descendant may attempt to follow in my footsteps to carry on the true way!

2223
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:06,250
To make sure our secret is safe, I have harnessed the spirits of those whose bodies I have defiled!

2224
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,530
To forever guard that place!

2225
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:10,350
Nah, no way!

2226
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,290
Oh, okay.

2227
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:14,350
So yeah, I have to fight a boss in my basement?

2228
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:15,530
That's cool!

2229
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,270
That's fun!

2230
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:19,050
Great!

2231
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:21,390
Wait!

2232
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,850
I didn't get my arrows back!

2233
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,290
I used all those silver arrows!

2234
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:28,550
The fools think I don't hear them speaking!

2235
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:31,390
I can hear their rumor and innuendo!

2236
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:34,870
They intend to meddle in powers they can barely comprehend!

2237
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:37,670
They call me an old fool and shun me!

2238
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:41,530
The young dare each other to step one foot in my yard!

2239
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:45,490
I have become the stuff of old wives tales and campfire stories!

2240
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,010
Wait!

2241
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:48,990
He literally became what I wanted to!

2242
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:52,290
I want to be the legend of the town as the...

2243
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:53,230
As the...

2244
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:54,870
As the balcony maiden!

2245
01:36:56,370 --> 01:37:00,230
They dismiss me as an oddity, but soon they will see!

2246
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,630
When all of Anvil lies invoiced around me!

2247
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:08,550
When their corpses litter the streets and their blood dampens the earth!

2248
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:12,050
Only then will my true power be unknown and feared!

2249
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:13,830
Okay.

2250
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,990
So I'm gonna stand outside my home and...

2251
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,050
And sleep!

2252
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,990
Luckily we don't need to sleep because I have no...

2253
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:25,770
Level up!

2254
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:26,830
But uh...

2255
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:29,170
Wait...

2256
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,070
We need to go talk to who?

2257
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,070
Oh wait!

2258
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:38,550
No, no, no!

2259
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:39,650
I don't want that one!

2260
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:40,870
No, no, back.

2261
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,790
We're still...

2262
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,370
Here, here, here, here.

2263
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:46,870
Is it...

2264
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:51,550
I don't see a...

2265
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:53,510
Velwyn.

2266
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:54,390
Who the heck was that?

2267
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:56,110
Is that the guy that I bought the house from?

2268
01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:00,130
I don't see a red arrow, so I'm like, hello?

2269
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:01,930
Why can't I run?

2270
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:06,010
That's what I was gonna do, I remember.

2271
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:08,310
Switch back to the steel.

2272
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:13,240
Hello there.

2273
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,580
Oh, it's because I was sneaking!

2274
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,660
I'm stupid, sorry.

2275
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:22,550
Greetings to you.

2276
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:23,130
Greetings!

2277
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,150
Get out of here before you get hurt.

2278
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,690
What's wrong?

2279
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,270
What'd I do?

2280
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:28,130
Are you the worm?

2281
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,230
You're the worm!

2282
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,650
Do the worm, Wilhelm!

2283
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:32,470
Do the worm!

2284
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,300
Little does everybody know, when he was a kid, he used to do the worm all the time.

2285
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:45,580
And that's where he got the nickname from, but now people just associate him with...

2286
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:46,600
being a worm.

2287
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,560
I'm Wilbur, owner and proprietor of the Count's Arms.

2288
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,200
We make beds and food available to guests.

2289
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,100
Can I help you?

2290
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,220
Where's that man?

2291
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,220
Where is Velwyn?

2292
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,840
As soon as you bought the place, he pretty much up and left.

2293
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:01,140
What?

2294
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:04,540
I hear tell he's making his way to the Imperial City.

2295
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,700
Why did he leave town?

2296
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,060
Leave me alone.

2297
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,260
Why do you hate me?

2298
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,680
Okay.

2299
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,560
Gosh.

2300
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:21,360
You do a silly dance once 15 years ago and it becomes your entire personality.

2301
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,900
Pretty much.

2302
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,280
Kids are cruel.

2303
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:36,330
Okay, we're off to find this guy, I guess.

2304
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,430
Why?

2305
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,930
He's never going to get business like this.

2306
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:45,290
What if I one day didn't want to stay in my house that was...

2307
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:47,330
10 feet away and instead...

2308
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:50,190
Hello.

2309
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,770
Oh, 3,000 steps?

2310
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:54,210
Nice.

2311
01:39:54,830 --> 01:40:00,630
What if instead I wanted to stay in a hotel just for the experience, you know?

2312
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:04,070
Kind of like when you stay in a hotel in your own city.

2313
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,310
Just to feel like you're on vacation.

2314
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:09,610
I don't know.

2315
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,950
So, to the Imperial City we go.

2316
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,480
Here, specifically.

2317
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,440
The Elven Gardens District.

2318
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,340
You into elves?

2319
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,320
Subaru Natsuki!

2320
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,280
Welcome to Membership!

2321
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:26,720
Thank you!

2322
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,580
Do you do that?

2323
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:32,580
If there's like a convention in my city...

2324
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,720
I think most people do that, no?

2325
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:43,980
I would rather pay a hotel than pay for parking.

2326
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,060
Are you in here?

2327
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:52,420
No?

2328
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,360
Really?

2329
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:58,550
No.

2330
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:59,110
Sorry.

2331
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,750
You look like someone I knew.

2332
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,210
Sorry.

2333
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:05,370
Sorry.

2334
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,650
I don't know my own...

2335
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:08,210
...strength.

2336
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:29,870
Pardon my butt.

2337
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:31,830
Velwyn!

2338
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:32,950
Velwyn!

2339
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,430
Wake!

2340
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,290
Get up, mister!

2341
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:37,450
Velwyn!

2342
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:38,290
Blurious!

2343
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:42,130
I'm surprised to see you all the way out here in the Imperial City.

2344
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:44,330
I stalked you here.

2345
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,910
So, you think I'm responsible?

2346
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:50,170
I suppose you're right.

2347
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:54,070
As the manor used to belong to my grandfather, Lorgren Beneris.

2348
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:54,830
Beneris.

2349
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:58,750
I knew there was a curse on that place, which is why I sold it to you so cheap.

2350
01:41:58,750 --> 01:41:59,830
Look at his face.

2351
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:02,930
I suppose I should have warned you, but I had to get out of Anvil.

2352
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:03,450
Why?

2353
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:09,010
My family said I could move here to the Imperial City once all our loose ends were tied down.

2354
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:12,030
The manor was one of those loose ends.

2355
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:12,470
Okay.

2356
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:15,450
I fear my own greed got the better of my judgement.

2357
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:18,990
I hope you weren't hurt badly in that horrible place.

2358
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:21,970
I've lost half of my silver arrows.

2359
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:23,230
Because I assumed you'd be able to lift the curse and be done with it.

2360
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:25,990
Yeah, well, help me.

2361
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:31,070
Lorgren Beneris was a strange old man, always dabbling and experimenting with magic.

2362
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:32,670
Why is he giving me the stink eye?

2363
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:40,130
It was mostly harmless until the fateful day he came across a tome bearing the evil magic of necromancy.

2364
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:40,870
Necromancy.

2365
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:46,590
He became obsessed and decided that by using necromancy, he could prolong his own life.

2366
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:54,410
The dark arts contained in the tome called for him to dig up the recently deceased in the nearby crypts under the cathedral.

2367
01:42:54,730 --> 01:43:00,690
When it was discovered that he did this, the Mages Guild called for a quick meeting to decide what to do.

2368
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,370
It only took minutes to decide.

2369
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:10,630
Led by a young upstart named Carrahill, the Mages Guild stormed Beneris Manor and slew Lorgren.

2370
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,450
Slew?

2371
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:14,590
However, amid the chaos, his body vanished.

2372
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:15,650
How?

2373
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:20,150
Because of this, the people of Anvil concluded the manor must be cursed.

2374
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:20,710
It is.

2375
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:25,610
You are the first person to set foot inside in a long time.

2376
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:26,090
Oh.

2377
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:29,110
How is the cheese... is the cheese still good?

2378
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:30,450
Lift the curse!

2379
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:37,510
According to the diary entry, it seems that I'm the only one who can open the secret door in the manor.

2380
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,090
Did you just say you have family?

2381
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:42,470
You are slightly guilty selling you the place under these circumstances.

2382
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,570
I'll meet you in Anvil at the Count's Arms.

2383
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:48,350
From there, we'll try to lift the curse together.

2384
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:48,890
Okay.

2385
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:52,130
Hope you're doing well.

2386
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:52,750
I have good news.

2387
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:55,990
I finally had a successful career mode run with Rice Shower!

2388
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:57,730
Oh my gosh!

2389
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:00,150
Congrats, Eric!

2390
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:00,990
Wow!

2391
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,530
I'll see you in Anvil.

2392
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:03,970
Okay.

2393
01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:05,090
I'll see you in Anvil.

2394
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:05,290
Oh.

2395
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:09,790
He's getting his head start.

2396
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,550
You forgot your...

2397
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:18,490
You forgot your sack!

2398
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:23,410
What if we just walk with him?

2399
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:27,190
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil.

2400
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:31,510
But he will admit to practicing it now that the Mage's Guild has banned it.

2401
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:31,970
Oh, where'd he go?

2402
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,970
There he is.

2403
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:36,110
Let's walk with him.

2404
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,560
Venerous?

2405
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:00,170
The faker?

2406
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:02,290
I'm so hungry.

2407
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:04,030
Ah, he's faking it.

2408
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:07,350
Blessings of Mystara upon you.

2409
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:11,970
Okay.

2410
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:16,130
Well, let's go to the main gate, I guess.

2411
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,030
What a faker.

2412
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:18,810
Gosh!

2413
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:19,930
We're phony!

2414
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:21,190
Big ol' phony!

2415
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,390
I'm so hungry, Minto.

2416
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:25,690
Stop faking it!

2417
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:27,950
Stop being so dramatic!

2418
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:32,970
Mystara.

2419
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,470
Mystara- Khan.

2420
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:42,630
He's so hungry.

2421
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:44,950
Oh, gosh!

2422
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,710
Sorry!

2423
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:47,170
Hail!

2424
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:49,890
Why are you coming up to me?

2425
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,730
Don't talk to me.

2426
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:51,790
I'm here for a while.

2427
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:52,310
Oh, you!

2428
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:52,950
Wait!

2429
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:54,150
I'm ready as I'll ever be.

2430
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:54,770
No, no, no!

2431
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:55,050
Talk!

2432
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:57,310
I was half expecting you not to show up.

2433
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,750
Are you ready to go to the manor?

2434
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:01,870
Yes!

2435
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:05,170
Then, let's get this over with.

2436
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:09,050
I don't relish the thought of spending too long inside of the manor.

2437
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:10,370
Follow me.

2438
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:10,830
Okay!

2439
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:12,990
How do you do?

2440
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:14,330
How do you do?

2441
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,730
Everybody's talking about...

2442
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:16,370
I'm leaving.

2443
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:17,810
Alright.

2444
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:20,150
Surely this will end well.

2445
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:20,850
I'm scared!

2446
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:22,150
Not gonna lie.

2447
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,650
Hi there!

2448
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:24,070
What's going on with you?

2449
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:24,730
What?

2450
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:26,310
What's going on with you?

2451
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:27,150
What's going on with you?

2452
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:29,830
Let's get to my house and let's quick save.

2453
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,870
Oh!

2454
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:34,290
I thought that was the rat lady.

2455
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,050
Wheeam!

2456
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:46,850
There he is, our hero.

2457
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:49,790
There he is.

2458
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:51,350
He's...

2459
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:52,290
He's walking.

2460
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:54,230
He's coming.

2461
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:56,470
He's got that stride.

2462
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:58,710
He's got that pep in his step.

2463
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,890
He's...

2464
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,210
Where is he going?

2465
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:02,610
Hello?

2466
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:03,090
Wait.

2467
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:03,930
Is that him?

2468
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:05,270
Okay.

2469
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,250
Here he is!

2470
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:16,510
Thoughts on ship loot art with other girls?

2471
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:21,230
I can't stop people from...

2472
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:22,670
Drawing what they want to draw.

2473
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:28,130
Though I think it...

2474
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:29,990
I think the most curious thing is...

2475
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:32,750
How many people get my chest size wrong.

2476
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:34,290
But that's okay, I guess.

2477
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:37,410
Where...

2478
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,650
How do you get up here anyway?

2479
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,670
Where is he going?

2480
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,150
The house is right here!

2481
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:43,210
Where?

2482
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,910
Oh, he's taking the back entrance.

2483
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:49,330
Oh, wait.

2484
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:50,770
There's a little staircase right here.

2485
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:51,570
Oh, okay.

2486
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,350
I've just been jumping.

2487
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:54,710
Alright.

2488
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:54,750
What?

2489
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:06,370
Velwyn and I have arrived in Beneris Manor.

2490
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:11,090
I must proceed cautiously to the secret room's entrance and prevent any harm from befall...

2491
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,370
Oh...

2492
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:13,570
Oh, no.

2493
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:14,630
Is this a...

2494
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:16,170
Is this an escort mission?

2495
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:17,510
Oh...

2496
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:18,330
Wait...

2497
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:19,050
I...

2498
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:20,110
I...

2499
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:20,190
I...

2500
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,050
I spent money for this!

2501
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:26,930
Oh...

2502
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:28,590
Oh...

2503
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:28,870
Oh...

2504
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:29,310
Oh...

2505
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:29,750
Oh...

2506
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:36,750
Oh...

2507
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:37,350
Oh...

2508
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,370
I...

2509
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:42,010
I paid for an escort mission.

2510
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:46,570
5,000 gold.

2511
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,760
I quicksaved outside.

2512
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:58,960
No way, but if they're ghosts, I don't have enough silver arrows.

2513
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,200
I have a dagger, will that work?

2514
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,640
Use the dagger.

2515
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,540
Oh gosh, it's good.

2516
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,900
Hopefully, we can make it to the basement without too much fighting.

2517
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:19,980
Don't say that!

2518
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,960
That's why the damn layout of this house is so weird.

2519
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,760
With the Sufferthorn.

2520
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,360
This one?

2521
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,740
My dagger.

2522
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:37,930
It's enchanted, so...

2523
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:40,490
I just don't want to waste all my silver arrows.

2524
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,390
I don't get them back.

2525
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:45,690
The frog shatter is such a funny name.

2526
01:49:50,990 --> 01:49:52,250
Anything enchanted works.

2527
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:54,990
Well, this is enchanted, so...

2528
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,990
I only have a couple other arrows.

2529
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:02,030
Oh wait, shadow hunt?

2530
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:03,830
Wait.

2531
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,860
But I thought my bow was not enchanted anymore.

2532
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,020
Hold on, I am going to use...

2533
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,160
Wait, I don't think I can repair it, can I?

2534
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh my...

2535
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,120
Hello?

2536
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,520
Where are my...

2537
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,000
Where are my repair...

2538
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:27,100
I just have this dude's hand in my inventory.

2539
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:29,780
Oh, this lockpick?

2540
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,700
It just ran out of juice.

2541
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,260
That's why I need the souls.

2542
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,040
Okay, got it, got it, got it.

2543
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,220
But does it still count as enchanted then?

2544
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:42,460
Probably not, no?

2545
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,140
Oh, it does?

2546
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:51,560
What then I...

2547
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:52,340
Oh, here it is.

2548
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:54,940
You cannot repair items.

2549
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,380
Okay, let's just go with the dagger.

2550
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:59,140
I quicksave, so we should be okay.

2551
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:17,550
Oh my gosh, don't stand so close.

2552
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:22,050
Taking all this ectoplasm...

2553
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:29,630
Taking all this ectoplasm though, it's kind of worth a lot.

2554
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:33,590
Eh, eh, ah, eh.

2555
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,360
Eh, there we go.

2556
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:45,600
Excuse me.

2557
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,400
This is the one I just killed, no?

2558
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,280
Oh, this one?

2559
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:48,880
No?

2560
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,500
This one.

2561
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,820
Okay, well, in to the basement.

2562
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:57,780
Nice guy.

2563
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,720
Oh, this one's also kind of...

2564
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,700
It's pretty far to the...

2565
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:05,320
Oh.

2566
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:07,500
Oh my gosh, there's so many guys in here.

2567
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,280
Oh

2568
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:16,840
my gosh.

2569
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:18,600
Let's get this over with.

2570
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:19,040
What's happening?

2571
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:19,920
Ah!

2572
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:20,900
What's happening?

2573
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:21,380
Ah!

2574
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,140
Ah!

2575
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:26,370
Oh my gosh.

2576
01:52:27,230 --> 01:52:28,150
Ah, what's happening?

2577
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:29,290
Ah!

2578
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:32,490
Don't die on me!

2579
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:34,930
Oh my gosh, I'm going to die.

2580
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:38,250
Ah!

2581
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:39,270
Holy cow!

2582
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:39,890
Okay, hold on.

2583
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:41,550
Uh...

2584
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:42,990
Potion of healing.

2585
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,430
Let's just, uh, take a couple of those.

2586
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:49,790
Okay.

2587
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:52,810
Um...

2588
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:54,730
What does the feeble vine do?

2589
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:55,210
Oh.

2590
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:56,090
Oh, it's a poison.

2591
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:58,910
Can I...

2592
01:52:58,910 --> 01:52:59,530
What is...

2593
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:05,250
You cannot drink any more potions.

2594
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:06,270
My tummy is full.

2595
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:09,410
Okay!

2596
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:12,810
All right.

2597
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:15,050
Uh...

2598
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:15,970
Block and talk.

2599
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:18,870
I don't know how to block, actually.

2600
01:53:19,170 --> 01:53:19,550
What is that?

2601
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:19,970
Right click?

2602
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:24,670
Wow!

2603
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:26,370
Memorable, man!

2604
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:27,610
Thank you so much for that time again.

2605
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:28,450
Thank you!

2606
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:30,650
Welcome back, wandering zero.

2607
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:31,810
Thank you so much for nine months.

2608
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,330
Okay.

2609
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:35,630
Right click.

2610
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:37,570
Oh!

2611
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:38,050
Whoa!

2612
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:38,410
Whoa!

2613
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:39,070
Whoa!

2614
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:39,590
Whoa!

2615
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:40,230
What?

2616
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:40,810
Excuse me!

2617
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:42,630
Oh my gosh.

2618
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:43,750
Please, get me out of here.

2619
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:49,090
You'll never take me down!

2620
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,010
Wait!

2621
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,590
I...

2622
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:51,290
I didn't...

2623
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:52,050
Oh...

2624
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:52,750
Oh, shoot.

2625
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,290
Do I need to...

2626
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:58,430
Oh, no!

2627
01:53:58,830 --> 01:53:59,030
Please!

2628
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,690
Let's get this over with!

2629
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:01,430
Oh, no!

2630
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,230
No, no!

2631
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:06,790
How do I stop this?

2632
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,250
Reload!

2633
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:12,270
Oh, I have to go through all this over again?

2634
01:54:12,990 --> 01:54:13,590
Okay.

2635
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:18,790
Ah...

2636
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:21,710
Ah...

2637
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:24,430
I should have quicksaved after we finished the...

2638
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:26,090
First part, though.

2639
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:27,850
Dang it.

2640
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:30,950
Block and talk.

2641
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:32,330
What does that mean, though?

2642
01:54:33,710 --> 01:54:35,250
Okay, I have to...

2643
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,790
Oh, put your weapon away and talk.

2644
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:37,670
Okay, okay, okay.

2645
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:38,910
Dang it!

2646
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,730
Dang it!

2647
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:43,850
All right.

2648
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:47,210
Stay out of my way, please!

2649
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:48,770
Hopefully we can make it to the basement.

2650
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,950
Please stay out of my way.

2651
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:50,870
Please.

2652
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:52,750
Please, Velwin, stay here.

2653
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,930
Lead on.

2654
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,010
You stay.

2655
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,430
You stay right here.

2656
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:58,110
Lift the curse.

2657
01:54:58,470 --> 01:55:01,010
I hope that whatever's behind the door would truly lift the curse.

2658
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:02,230
You can block and eat him.

2659
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:04,390
If his disposition is high, he will forgive you.

2660
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:08,810
Did you hear a noise?

2661
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:10,990
Yes.

2662
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,490
Can I block the ghost attacks?

2663
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,090
Time to see.

2664
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,590
Nope.

2665
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:16,970
Okay.

2666
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:24,910
Where's the other ghost?

2667
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:25,170
Here.

2668
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:31,290
Oh, shoot.

2669
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:31,910
Hello?

2670
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:33,130
Ah!

2671
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,200
Velwin, please!

2672
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,160
Oh, my God!

2673
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,750
Okay.

2674
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:48,550
All right.

2675
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:49,830
Ugh.

2676
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:51,270
Ugh.

2677
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55,510
I crashed my car last night!

2678
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:00,290
I hope you're okay.

2679
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:01,330
I'm so sorry.

2680
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,020
Okay.

2681
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,160
We're fully healed again.

2682
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,440
Lead on.

2683
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,640
I don't think he'll stay here.

2684
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,420
This place makes me uneasy.

2685
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,060
Let's tread wisely and make our way quickly to the basement.

2686
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:34,210
Ugh.

2687
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:37,650
Did you hear a noise?

2688
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:39,210
Yeah, he won't stay.

2689
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:40,450
I think we gotta...

2690
01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:41,730
Okay, I'll just quick save here.

2691
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:44,070
Okay.

2692
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,030
All right.

2693
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:47,930
All right.

2694
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:49,710
His hair is glitching out.

2695
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:50,730
Let's just...

2696
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:52,250
Just oblivion things.

2697
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:53,430
All right.

2698
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:55,410
I'm scared.

2699
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:16,550
I'm scared.

2700
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:18,810
I'm scared.

2701
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:19,210
Just kidding.

2702
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:22,070
I'm scared.

2703
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:29,310
Oh, there he is.

2704
01:57:29,410 --> 01:57:29,710
Oh, my gosh.

2705
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:31,030
I was gonna say he didn't come through with us.

2706
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:34,810
You know what?

2707
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:36,770
Okay, what I'll do...

2708
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:39,230
Is I will...

2709
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:40,430
Use...

2710
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:42,850
The silver arrows...

2711
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:45,070
And then...

2712
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:47,570
Yeah, I think I'll just use the silver arrows.

2713
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:51,070
Can you tell him to wait?

2714
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:52,510
It does not seem to be the case.

2715
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:52,910
No.

2716
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:57,630
So there's three there, and then there's one guy over there.

2717
01:57:57,630 --> 01:57:58,010
I see.

2718
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:11,860
Just the steel arrows?

2719
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:12,860
I guess we'll try him.

2720
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:18,770
Oh, it worked!

2721
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,370
It did work.

2722
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,890
Was it because of my bow?

2723
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:23,650
Okay.

2724
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:25,530
I'm gonna have to learn how to repair my bow.

2725
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:28,830
Nice!

2726
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:34,670
Okay, awesome.

2727
01:58:39,170 --> 01:58:39,650
Nice!

2728
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:42,010
I see that one right there.

2729
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,870
On the map.

2730
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:44,670
Don't know where he is, though.

2731
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,860
It seems that is the only one.

2732
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:51,220
Okay.

2733
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:56,840
Do steel arrows also get consumed?

2734
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:57,480
They do.

2735
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:58,280
So, you know what?

2736
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,660
I might just use my iron arrows.

2737
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:07,990
Yeah, that's the same guy.

2738
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:08,290
Okay.

2739
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:12,900
Hello?

2740
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:14,880
Let me take your ectoplasm, please.

2741
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:21,680
Can I quick save here?

2742
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:23,700
I can.

2743
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:24,520
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

2744
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,080
All right, all right, all right.

2745
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:27,900
Ah!

2746
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,520
Well, we found the ghost.

2747
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:37,360
The other guy.

2748
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:41,080
Yay!

2749
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:41,480
Oh!

2750
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,740
All is well now.

2751
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,380
Are you safe?

2752
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:46,180
You look unharmed.

2753
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,100
You look unharmed.

2754
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:56,590
You ready?

2755
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:57,470
Okay, guess so.

2756
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:05,230
Belwyn and I arrived at the secret door.

2757
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:10,780
Do your thing!

2758
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:19,990
Okay, I can't do anything.

2759
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:20,010
I can't do anything.

2760
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,490
Uh.

2761
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:28,400
Lead on.

2762
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,480
No, you.

2763
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:33,760
I'll be glad to get this over with and get back to the Imperial City.

2764
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:37,100
As soon as this opens, I'm leaving.

2765
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,100
Yeah, me too.

2766
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:40,660
Oh!

2767
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:44,920
Belwyn successfully opened the door to the secret room, which has stopped the ghost from attacking.

2768
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:45,840
Then he...

2769
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,760
He then ran off, leaving me to clean up the mess.

2770
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,440
It's up to me and me alone to investigate what's beyond the mysterious portal.

2771
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,680
Oh, he's...

2772
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,300
Uh.

2773
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:56,200
Wait, wait, wait!

2774
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:57,180
Wait!

2775
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:18,250
Don't you want to say hi to your grandpa?

2776
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:21,210
Oh!

2777
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,480
I got some mushrooms.

2778
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,380
Fresh from my basement.

2779
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:33,600
The Tome of Unlife.

2780
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,160
It's got two pages.

2781
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:41,060
I see.

2782
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:47,210
And some tongs.

2783
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:49,010
Interesting.

2784
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:51,030
Interesting.

2785
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:53,510
I don't want to step in that.

2786
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:58,310
Looks like the music is too whimsical for what's going...

2787
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,150
Activate!

2788
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,150
Wait!

2789
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:01,550
What do you mean by that?

2790
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:05,860
Oh, yes.

2791
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:07,860
The candle in the casket.

2792
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,120
There's so many little...

2793
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:14,410
More bones.

2794
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:15,430
What is that?

2795
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:16,090
Oh, it's a sack.

2796
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:22,330
Resist poison on self?

2797
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:27,030
Thank you, grandpa!

2798
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,480
Nice.

2799
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:38,840
It was that one, right?

2800
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:45,170
I wish I could tell.

2801
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:47,210
Yes.

2802
02:02:57,790 --> 02:02:59,830
Skelly's also got some...

2803
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:01,090
Got some stuff.

2804
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:02,810
Well, okay.

2805
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:06,410
Do I have to activate it?

2806
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:07,250
Or...

2807
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:08,770
Can I just...

2808
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:10,570
Do the ghosts keep attacking me?

2809
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:12,030
Every night?

2810
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:13,790
I mean...

2811
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:15,690
Like...

2812
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:26,790
Save?

2813
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:27,750
Oh, I have.

2814
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,590
I will.

2815
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:33,550
You have a corpse in my basement.

2816
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:34,290
It's just...

2817
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:37,590
It's just Halloween decoration.

2818
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,070
It's free XP.

2819
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:40,610
Why not?

2820
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:43,190
You wanted a haunted house.

2821
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:45,910
I thought that it would be like...

2822
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:47,530
A regular Joe.

2823
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:50,390
I thought it would be a guy who would be like...

2824
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:50,930
Hey, buddy.

2825
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:51,790
Like a...

2826
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:52,910
You know, like a typical...

2827
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:55,530
Ghost in a top hat.

2828
02:03:56,190 --> 02:03:57,190
And he just like...

2829
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:58,710
Wandered around my house.

2830
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:00,690
I didn't expect to get attacked.

2831
02:04:02,590 --> 02:04:04,310
Ketou, thank you so much for the farm.

2832
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:05,250
Ketou, thank you.

2833
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,390
If ghosts keep coming...

2834
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,450
It's a training feature.

2835
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:10,590
Just like having an exercise room.

2836
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:16,280
And...

2837
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:18,380
You got an ectoplasm farm.

2838
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:19,980
You're so right, honestly.

2839
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:24,060
I didn't know the ghosts would be evil.

2840
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,600
I don't go to your house...

2841
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,080
And haunt your place and...

2842
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:29,600
Leave...

2843
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:31,060
Well, I do leave ectoplasm...

2844
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:32,660
Sometimes.

2845
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:35,820
If you...

2846
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:37,500
If you bought my mug...

2847
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,300
There's definitely ectoplasm on that.

2848
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:42,580
But you do.

2849
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,060
Okay, but I don't attack you.

2850
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:47,480
Always.

2851
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:52,780
I just possessed you and eat your food.

2852
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:54,820
And then...

2853
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:54,940
Leave!

2854
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,280
I don't...

2855
02:04:58,280 --> 02:04:58,780
I don't...

2856
02:04:58,780 --> 02:04:59,820
I'm not like this...

2857
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:01,720
Where I wake you up out of your sleep.

2858
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,840
I'm not some paralysis demon.

2859
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:07,040
Unless you want me to be.

2860
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:12,680
That's what I stepped in last night.

2861
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,760
Grave robber minky.

2862
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,500
Okay, well I saved.

2863
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,460
So let's check out the damage, I guess.

2864
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:23,920
Activate.

2865
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:25,640
Activate?

2866
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:26,860
Activate.

2867
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:28,980
Oops.

2868
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,520
Activate!

2869
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,000
Uh...

2870
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,160
Uh...

2871
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:45,210
Oh, the panels?

2872
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:49,270
I am Lord Grin Berenice.

2873
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:54,290
And I desire the chance to atone for my sins.

2874
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:59,290
The things I've done to the people of Anvil.

2875
02:05:59,590 --> 02:06:03,530
The horrible, unspeakable acts I've committed.

2876
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:06,250
Demand repentance.

2877
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:12,110
Dary was justified in his actions.

2878
02:06:12,130 --> 02:06:13,270
Oh, he's changed.

2879
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:14,450
This is character development.

2880
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:17,510
Was the only way to stop the madness.

2881
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:21,150
I have accepted that fate.

2882
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:27,430
Now, so I may make my final peace with the Nine.

2883
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:33,450
Please, reach with my hand to my body.

2884
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:40,850
Only, when I have believed in this eternal Nine.

2885
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:47,500
I don't know.

2886
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,800
That doesn't sound very convincing.

2887
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,740
After touching the altar, I heard the voice of Lord Grin Benerice.

2888
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:56,240
He said he wished to atone for his past and make peace with the Nines.

2889
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,480
All he wished was to be whole again.

2890
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:01,540
This must be the way to lift the curse from Benerice Manor.

2891
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:06,720
I should touch his skeleton while I carry the bony hand and put an end to this madness.

2892
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:13,770
That's kind of sus, no?

2893
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:22,410
As a fellow spirit.

2894
02:07:26,290 --> 02:07:26,790
Um...

2895
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:42,280
Hmm...

2896
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,280
Oh yeah, there.

2897
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,540
This hand is missing.

2898
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:50,680
It never fails to lose me.

2899
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:51,800
It never fails to lose me.

2900
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,580
It never fails to manipulate.

2901
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,660
You've assisted me in completing the very thing.

2902
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:03,040
Carrie Hill and his cabal sought to prevent all those years ago.

2903
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:03,680
Uh-oh.

2904
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:04,380
My...

2905
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:07,080
Ascension to immortality.

2906
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:07,860
Uh-oh.

2907
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:13,920
Last time I clashed with battles, I underestimated their power.

2908
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:18,000
I shall not repeat that mistake twice.

2909
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,340
But he's just a skelly, right?

2910
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:30,600
Oh, shoot.

2911
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:32,460
Ah,

2912
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:43,970
don't summon skellies, please!

2913
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:45,010
Ah!

2914
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:54,230
Ah!

2915
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:03,870
Oh, shoot.

2916
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:05,350
Oh, shoot.

2917
02:09:05,550 --> 02:09:06,210
What's happening to me?

2918
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:10,430
Oh, I did it.

2919
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:19,060
Completing the skeleton was a ruse!

2920
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,980
And Lord Grin rose from the dead.

2921
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,240
I had no choice but to destroy him.

2922
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,580
With his destruction, the curse of Venerys Manor was lifted.

2923
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:30,800
I should return to the Count's arms and speak with Velwyn.

2924
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:32,840
Oh, shoot!

2925
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,860
All he has is bone meal.

2926
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:37,360
You've been dead.

2927
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:40,060
Oh my god, my health.

2928
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:40,820
Do you see that?

2929
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:42,860
I almost died!

2930
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:44,240
I have one HP!

2931
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:54,680
Are you just gonna stay here, or...?

2932
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:58,700
Cool.

2933
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,300
Free bed.

2934
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,320
Okay, I was gonna say...

2935
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:11,220
I could really...

2936
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:12,660
Uh...

2937
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:15,160
Take his stuff...

2938
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:16,520
Oh, he's got his bone meal.

2939
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:22,240
He ain't got nothing else.

2940
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,900
I did take his...

2941
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,180
His staff.

2942
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:27,920
Oh, I can't read.

2943
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:29,100
Wait, where's his staff?

2944
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:31,520
Oh, this one.

2945
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,080
Staff of flame.

2946
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,700
Take his stuff.

2947
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,400
I mean, staff.

2948
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:54,520
Aw, my house is a mess.

2949
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:57,040
Actually, this kind of feels at home, though.

2950
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:58,780
Oh!

2951
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:07,330
Whoa!

2952
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:11,770
Why is this still here?

2953
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:14,430
That's my...

2954
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,010
It's like such a hazard.

2955
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:16,910
Free tomatoes!

2956
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:24,300
Crystal ball.

2957
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:28,340
Is all the Tamika still here, or...?

2958
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:30,280
I got some gold-trimmed shoes!

2959
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:32,220
Outfit?

2960
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:37,230
Wow!

2961
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:41,770
He fixed my house for me!

2962
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:47,090
The ectoplasm is empty.

2963
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:48,230
I took all of it.

2964
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,700
Check the door.

2965
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:53,200
Office.

2966
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:54,520
Wait, there was a...

2967
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,600
There was another door?

2968
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:01,540
Oh, my gosh.

2969
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:01,980
You're right.

2970
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:04,080
Guide to Anvil.

2971
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:05,680
The Eastern Provinces.

2972
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:09,180
Oh!

2973
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:10,140
Wow!

2974
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:11,060
Fancy!

2975
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:13,080
I didn't even see this before.

2976
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,900
Check the bathroom.

2977
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:17,960
Now, I really don't think there's a bathroom in there.

2978
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:20,820
Yeah, see?

2979
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:21,480
These are empty.

2980
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,720
They're just decoration.

2981
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:23,460
Now.

2982
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:30,390
If you put stuff in these containers, they don't despawn.

2983
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:32,710
So, if I put some grapes in here...

2984
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:41,650
Put some leaves...

2985
02:12:43,410 --> 02:12:45,030
Oh, I thought it despawned.

2986
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:03,900
Containers.

2987
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:04,900
Oh, wait.

2988
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:06,300
Will the containers...

2989
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:07,220
Despawn?

2990
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:12,760
Wait till after the quest before you put stuff away.

2991
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:14,160
It might despawn on completion.

2992
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:15,660
What?

2993
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:16,060
Really?

2994
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,060
The furniture, not the ghost.

2995
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:20,180
But what if I don't want the ghost to despawn?

2996
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:21,580
Nice.

2997
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,900
Cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.

2998
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:24,840
Thank you, Kappa.

2999
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:28,180
Don't put stuff in the ghost.

3000
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:29,240
No!

3001
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:31,380
I

3002
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,380
don't want them to despawn.

3003
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:40,940
No!

3004
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:44,620
I don't think we can control the ghost puddles.

3005
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:53,860
But...

3006
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:54,700
But...

3007
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,860
But I just said if I'm like...

3008
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:07,130
With the here...

3009
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:09,610
I like it.

3010
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:11,630
I like it.

3011
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:12,630
I should be able to...

3012
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:13,490
It's my house.

3013
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:17,010
And then...

3014
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:18,170
Will I...

3015
02:14:18,170 --> 02:14:19,430
Lose my new roommate?

3016
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,100
She's still there, right?

3017
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:28,600
Okay, good.

3018
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:32,640
Lord Grin, don't leave me!

3019
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,180
I just...

3020
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,580
I'll just leave the bone meal.

3021
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:47,620
I'll leave it!

3022
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,820
So that he...

3023
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,480
Stays.

3024
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:53,140
He won't leave.

3025
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:56,720
I believe he'll keep trying to give me the bone meal and I'll say, I'm sorry, I can't accept it.

3026
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,180
Then what if I give him something?

3027
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:03,120
What if I give him some grapes?

3028
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:05,980
Only one, though.

3029
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:07,460
I like to eat the rest.

3030
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,880
I gave you a snack!

3031
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,240
You're not allowed to leave!

3032
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:36,790
It's still here, at least.

3033
02:15:39,630 --> 02:15:40,230
Kind of?

3034
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:42,490
Okay, yeah.

3035
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:54,560
I really wanted a ghost roommate.

3036
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:58,880
I didn't want to defeat them.

3037
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:18,180
Bad!

3038
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:20,460
If

3039
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:30,360
I were your ghost roommate, you wouldn't attack me.

3040
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,980
Even if I summoned Skellyman, would you?

3041
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:35,300
Everybody's talking about the Prophet.

3042
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:40,360
After the attack on the chapel, people are inclined to believe almost anything.

3043
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,220
Of course.

3044
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:42,320
Good day.

3045
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:43,020
Goodbye.

3046
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:46,680
It's been 87 years, you gotta let go!

3047
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:48,320
He was grandpa!

3048
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,120
Calling the ghost buzzers.

3049
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:54,520
No!

3050
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:59,300
I think running runs in their family.

3051
02:16:59,300 --> 02:16:59,720
Family!

3052
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:07,850
Okay, I'm over it.

3053
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:12,370
The lifter of curses returns!

3054
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:18,270
I'm sorry for running away like that, but fear got the best of me.

3055
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,350
Well, I killed your grandpa.

3056
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:20,190
I'm glad you talked for him to come and with you.

3057
02:17:20,190 --> 02:17:20,330
I'm glad you talked for him to come and with you.

3058
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:20,630
I'm glad you talked for him to come and with you.

3059
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:25,710
Now that the curse has been lifted, I feel like I've taken care of my family's unfinished business.

3060
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:27,830
Excellent work, my friend.

3061
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:30,830
May the mana give you many years of happiness.

3062
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:34,570
I'm now off to the Imperial City once more.

3063
02:17:34,970 --> 02:17:35,450
Farewell.

3064
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:40,170
With how everybody glitches out of this game, it feels like everything is my delusions.

3065
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:42,530
Like, nobody is actually truly here.

3066
02:17:43,010 --> 02:17:44,750
I feel like I'm not playing...

3067
02:17:44,750 --> 02:17:46,050
The scent is unfamiliar.

3068
02:17:46,710 --> 02:17:49,650
I feel like I'm playing something, like I'm in the Matrix.

3069
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:55,810
And like, reality is falling apart at the seams.

3070
02:17:56,130 --> 02:17:57,590
The mana is finally cleansed.

3071
02:17:58,390 --> 02:17:58,770
Yeah!

3072
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,310
Wait, hold on.

3073
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,330
Enjoy the mana.

3074
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:03,210
It suits you well.

3075
02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:04,030
Thanks!

3076
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:07,450
Enjoyed to hear that you were able to cleanse the mana.

3077
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:08,810
Well done, my friend.

3078
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:10,910
Well done, my friend.

3079
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:11,970
Thank you!

3080
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:13,090
Wait, how's our friendship?

3081
02:18:14,130 --> 02:18:14,650
100!

3082
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:16,690
He loves me.

3083
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,450
Why don't you...

3084
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:19,870
Velwyn.

3085
02:18:20,430 --> 02:18:21,350
18 a single.

3086
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:25,350
Okay, bye.

3087
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:27,450
Good fortune to you.

3088
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:35,890
You know, if you reach level 100 with me, then I would...

3089
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:37,630
Crawl into your skin.

3090
02:18:38,630 --> 02:18:39,270
And...

3091
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:41,170
I would make a home in there.

3092
02:18:41,330 --> 02:18:41,590
Everyone is talking about the prophet.

3093
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:46,810
After the attack on the chapel, people are inclined to believe almost anything.

3094
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:47,790
Ash.

3095
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:51,870
They say...

3096
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:52,170
Ah!

3097
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:53,050
Sorry.

3098
02:18:53,950 --> 02:18:54,510
Timothy!

3099
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:56,810
Oh no!

3100
02:18:57,730 --> 02:18:58,590
Without question.

3101
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:59,430
Bye.

3102
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:00,530
Take care.

3103
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:11,320
Whatever you're looking for, I'm sure I don't know how to find it.

3104
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:12,060
Oh my god.

3105
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:14,340
Are you the one haunting my house?

3106
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:15,020
Who are you?

3107
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:16,380
Val Morvayne.

3108
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:19,540
Been making weapons and arms here in Anvil for 30 years.

3109
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:21,300
People say I do good work.

3110
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:21,880
Do you take bribes?

3111
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:23,420
And I don't aim to argue with them.

3112
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:27,500
Nobody has ever gotten past level...

3113
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,040
9...

3114
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,280
10.

3115
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:30,060
Level 10.

3116
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:32,140
So no.

3117
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:34,120
Good luck.

3118
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,340
What rumors we got?

3119
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:48,460
You're the one they call the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?

3120
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,520
I am a Hero of Kvatch.

3121
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:51,500
Going to close the Oblivion Gate and save the city?

3122
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:53,200
Okay.

3123
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:55,580
Oh, he will re...

3124
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:56,880
Wait, will he repair my...

3125
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:58,180
I can fix whatever you break.

3126
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:59,920
Can you repair this?

3127
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:01,280
25.

3128
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:05,040
Actually...

3129
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:06,120
Yeah...

3130
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:06,720
Well...

3131
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:07,440
What...

3132
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:08,140
What is it at?

3133
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:08,980
It's at 43.

3134
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:10,840
Yeah, repair it.

3135
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:12,860
Okay, good.

3136
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:13,980
Okay, cool!

3137
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:16,600
Well, since I can't repair that myself...

3138
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:17,840
Leave me alone.

3139
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:18,820
Why?

3140
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:21,540
I just paid you!

3141
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:31,770
Tidying, citizen.

3142
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:33,510
What?

3143
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:37,650
Is it because I made him work after hours?

3144
02:20:41,070 --> 02:20:42,190
Goodness gracious.

3145
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:46,330
Let's go to sleep in our bed and not get attacked for the first time.

3146
02:20:53,890 --> 02:20:55,010
Well, guys...

3147
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:55,490
Oh my gosh!

3148
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:57,230
I can't believe we actually got our house!

3149
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:01,890
It still has...

3150
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:03,150
Ectoplasm in it.

3151
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:06,170
If I sleep though, I'm afraid.

3152
02:21:07,950 --> 02:21:09,390
Let's sleep for...

3153
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:10,170
Eight hours.

3154
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:13,990
Bribing for extra disposition.

3155
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:17,570
I'm not a ghost that can be bribed.

3156
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:27,100
Good morning, my home!

3157
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,860
You think I could bring like a lovely lady back here?

3158
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:34,180
This bed is big enough for the two of us.

3159
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:38,280
Good morning!

3160
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:40,400
Good morning!

3161
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:41,200
Good morning!

3162
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:47,370
Time to sigh on the balcony.

3163
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:49,990
Hold on, I'm doing my morning greetings.

3164
02:21:55,710 --> 02:21:58,070
Before he leaves, I think we should take some pictures.

3165
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:01,130
Wait, hold on.

3166
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:02,110
Let's take off our hood.

3167
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:04,630
Hot dog!

3168
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:06,930
Hey there, pretty ghost.

3169
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:07,970
You're staying hydrated?

3170
02:22:08,490 --> 02:22:09,670
Blue, thank you!

3171
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:12,710
I will in a second.

3172
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:15,690
I actually just finished my coffee.

3173
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:17,450
Okay.

3174
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:20,050
You guys take some pictures.

3175
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:22,630
I'm gonna go...

3176
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,210
Get some water.

3177
02:22:25,630 --> 02:22:27,690
Hold on, let me fix the angle a little bit.

3178
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:35,370
No, no.

3179
02:22:43,070 --> 02:22:44,030
Me and...

3180
02:22:44,770 --> 02:22:45,490
There we go.

3181
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:45,850
Okay.

3182
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,950
Alright, I'll be right back.

3183
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:49,050
I'm back.

3184
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:51,930
Actually, I realized I also wanna be in the picture too.

3185
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:57,260
I wanna be in the picture!

3186
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:58,920
I wanna be in the picture!

3187
02:23:59,640 --> 02:23:59,860
Oh!

3188
02:24:00,220 --> 02:24:01,060
Itina, your hair.

3189
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,940
The three of us!

3190
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:10,200
It's the three of us!

3191
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:12,680
Hold on, I'm gonna get rid of chat.

3192
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:13,740
And...

3193
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:15,160
Notice too, for just a second.

3194
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:19,040
It's the three of us!

3195
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,320
It's the three of us!

3196
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,900
It's the three of us!

3197
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,360
Hold on.

3198
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:32,080
It's the three of us!

3199
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,420
We're living together.

3200
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:36,480
The two ghosts and an alien.

3201
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:38,400
But she's not an alien.

3202
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:41,560
It's the three of us!

3203
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:42,740
We're...

3204
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:43,920
It's a new sitcom!

3205
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,660
We are living in a house together!

3206
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:51,060
And we go on crazy adventures!

3207
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,100
And then...

3208
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:54,060
Maybe sometimes...

3209
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:56,140
He leaves...

3210
02:24:56,140 --> 02:24:56,280
Lo...

3211
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:56,580
Lo...

3212
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:57,120
What's his name?

3213
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:58,000
Lo...

3214
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,840
Logan?

3215
02:24:59,140 --> 02:24:59,800
Logran.

3216
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:04,540
Logran leaves some ectoplasm and he said...

3217
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:08,780
No, Itina says, Hey, who left ectoplasm on the toilet seat?

3218
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:09,700
And...

3219
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:12,620
I point at him and he points at me and I go...

3220
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:13,200
Not me!

3221
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:15,400
It was him!

3222
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:17,440
And...

3223
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:18,640
No, no!

3224
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,180
And...

3225
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:21,700
Classic Logan...

3226
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:23,040
Laugh track!

3227
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,600
Ha ha ha!

3228
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:26,400
Ha ha ha!

3229
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:27,920
Ha ha ha!

3230
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:29,040
And we...

3231
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:29,800
Know...

3232
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:31,720
Itina thinks that...

3233
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:32,420
That...

3234
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:33,840
We don't know that...

3235
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:34,880
She is an alien.

3236
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,080
But we do know...

3237
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,880
She thinks that we think that she is a...

3238
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:41,020
Of...

3239
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:41,400
Of...

3240
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:41,840
Elf.

3241
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:43,660
But we know...

3242
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:44,600
Cause...

3243
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:45,600
Of course we do.

3244
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:48,340
The perfect sitcom!

3245
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:49,640
From...

3246
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:52,580
Lord...

3247
02:25:52,580 --> 02:25:52,900
Grand...

3248
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:53,660
Paul...

3249
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:56,600
Okay, never mind.

3250
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:57,560
The joke is ruined.

3251
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:59,220
I don't want to live with that!

3252
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:00,300
Ew!

3253
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,180
Get out of my house!

3254
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:02,400
Oh!

3255
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:05,100
We're getting into cinema.

3256
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:21,210
Okay.

3257
02:26:22,610 --> 02:26:23,530
See you later!

3258
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:24,870
Oh!

3259
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:25,190
Sorry!

3260
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:26,250
I forgot to bring you guys back!

3261
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:28,170
Come back to me!

3262
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:33,010
We're zooming!

3263
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:41,170
Run into the wall!

3264
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:48,130
Okay.

3265
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:49,270
There we go.

3266
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:53,110
Where is my...

3267
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,650
Oh, there we go.

3268
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:54,210
That was weird.

3269
02:26:54,330 --> 02:26:55,450
My mouse was like...

3270
02:26:56,090 --> 02:26:56,670
Acting weird.

3271
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:57,690
Okay, cool!

3272
02:26:58,890 --> 02:26:59,330
Yeah!

3273
02:27:00,750 --> 02:27:02,430
Now what do we do, you guys?

3274
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:05,290
What other quests do I have?

3275
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:10,790
I forgot that Q does not go to quest.

3276
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:16,290
I love how oblivion lets you set your own goals outside the main mission...

3277
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:16,830
Or main quest.

3278
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:18,170
Congrats on the house!

3279
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:18,810
Thank you!

3280
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:22,850
Let's see...

3281
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:24,510
Dunbaro Cove.

3282
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:25,590
Wait, what's...

3283
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,690
When the vow breaks?

3284
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:30,530
When the vow breaks...

3285
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:31,030
Oh, this!

3286
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:34,130
An unusual mace named the Rock Shatter.

3287
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:41,490
Who is Maeva?

3288
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:54,770
It's not giving me any...

3289
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:59,410
Any red arrow.

3290
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:05,920
Go back to looting that fort.

3291
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,240
Yeah, we could do that.

3292
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:10,220
Where did you find it?

3293
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:11,080
In here.

3294
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:12,260
In the fort.

3295
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,880
Fort Strand.

3296
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:18,550
The chapel.

3297
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:25,260
You're back and in the house?

3298
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:26,940
I guess we're no longer...

3299
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:27,780
Apartment!

3300
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:39,390
She's at the farm outside of Anvil.

3301
02:28:40,650 --> 02:28:41,190
Okay.

3302
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:45,150
Who will take up this holy crusade?

3303
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,670
Who?

3304
02:28:47,350 --> 02:28:48,150
Oh my!

3305
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:50,610
To what do I owe this honor?

3306
02:28:50,610 --> 02:28:53,270
I am but a humble prophet.

3307
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:56,390
What business do you have with me?

3308
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:01,590
Um...

3309
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,890
Nothing, I think.

3310
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:04,450
Actually.

3311
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:05,630
Hold on, guys.

3312
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:06,490
Let me make sure...

3313
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:08,070
Let me check when my next stream is.

3314
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:10,550
I think I know.

3315
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:17,960
Uh...

3316
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:19,260
Checking my schedule.

3317
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:20,060
Okay.

3318
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:23,140
In an hour and a half.

3319
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:24,780
Think on this.

3320
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:25,840
Think on this.

3321
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,360
What happened here...

3322
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:27,980
Is only...

3323
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,220
I'll probably play for like another...

3324
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:33,720
Hour.

3325
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:38,380
Let's hear it.

3326
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:40,960
Okay.

3327
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:41,920
To the farm!

3328
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:44,820
Farm outside of Anvil.

3329
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:46,420
Anvil's farm.

3330
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:48,000
The farm.

3331
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,620
The farm in which...

3332
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:51,560
Resides a woman who...

3333
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,900
Is an anvil.

3334
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:57,880
The anvil lady.

3335
02:29:58,180 --> 02:29:59,080
The anvil farm.

3336
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,880
That farm.

3337
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:01,920
Anvil farm.

3338
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:03,940
This is the fort.

3339
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:05,900
And then we find the farm.

3340
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:08,820
Farm.

3341
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:09,700
Farm!

3342
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:13,120
Farmville.

3343
02:30:13,580 --> 02:30:16,160
I never played Farmville even once.

3344
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:20,800
I don't know.

3345
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:21,860
I think...

3346
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:25,100
I didn't play any of those Facebook games.

3347
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:27,700
Hello, hello, Minto.

3348
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,880
Hello, hello, Brandon.

3349
02:30:33,090 --> 02:30:33,760
If there's a...

3350
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:35,800
If this is a farm...

3351
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:37,900
Yikes.

3352
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,340
It's not very well kept now, is it?

3353
02:30:45,220 --> 02:30:47,360
The door is locked and no one seems to be home.

3354
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:48,680
Oh!

3355
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:50,420
The door is locked.

3356
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:54,000
Look at all them blueberries!

3357
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:00,600
Well, why aren't they home?

3358
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:06,160
You were more of a Newgrounds cow.

3359
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:10,420
I...

3360
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:11,600
I...

3361
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,020
I...

3362
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:15,340
I...

3363
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:15,980
I...

3364
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:16,460
Uh...

3365
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:18,160
Uh...

3366
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:20,300
I know I should not admit that.

3367
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:30,450
Uh...

3368
02:31:30,450 --> 02:31:31,810
But I didn't play...

3369
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:34,750
Normal games on Newgrounds.

3370
02:31:34,750 --> 02:31:35,790
Is that a cemetery?

3371
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:36,190
Cemetery!

3372
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:37,470
What?

3373
02:31:38,010 --> 02:31:39,790
A cemetery plus...

3374
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:41,990
A cave?

3375
02:31:42,950 --> 02:31:44,770
It's the smoke hall!

3376
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:47,630
Whoa!

3377
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:53,800
Wait, dude.

3378
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:55,040
Do you think there's ghosts in here?

3379
02:32:03,910 --> 02:32:04,570
Whoa.

3380
02:32:14,690 --> 02:32:16,330
I can't tell are those people...

3381
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:18,450
Is that a person right there?

3382
02:32:21,470 --> 02:32:22,890
I can't tell.

3383
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:28,150
Is that a person?

3384
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:30,250
Right there?

3385
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:43,660
I can't tell.

3386
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,760
Looks like it.

3387
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,460
Nope!

3388
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:52,800
It's a rack!

3389
02:32:55,230 --> 02:32:56,790
Oh, I see it now.

3390
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:04,600
I hear something that sounds like breathing.

3391
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,060
This place is pretty spooky.

3392
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,300
Ah, it's a rock.

3393
02:33:15,370 --> 02:33:16,890
I did hear breathing.

3394
02:33:17,250 --> 02:33:18,410
It was the ghosts!

3395
02:33:27,670 --> 02:33:28,990
I've had my fill.

3396
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:37,150
Cool!

3397
02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:40,650
Uh...

3398
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:41,430
Not cool.

3399
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:43,150
Why is the music still happening?

3400
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:01,270
Stop throwing snowballs at me!

3401
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:04,030
I don't have that power!

3402
02:34:06,790 --> 02:34:08,790
I can't believe he followed me out!

3403
02:34:09,630 --> 02:34:11,610
I'm obsessed with me or something.

3404
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:12,270
Gosh!

3405
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:16,630
There's like a fellow ghost and she's so cute!

3406
02:34:18,470 --> 02:34:20,010
I gotta shoot my shot!

3407
02:34:20,470 --> 02:34:21,450
With a snowball!

3408
02:34:22,910 --> 02:34:23,830
Or something.

3409
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:26,730
What's that up there?

3410
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:28,290
Well, I think I've been there before.

3411
02:34:30,590 --> 02:34:32,110
In broad daylight.

3412
02:34:32,570 --> 02:34:32,970
I know!

3413
02:34:33,550 --> 02:34:33,890
I know!

3414
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:37,010
Golly!

3415
02:34:38,490 --> 02:34:40,070
It ain't easy being me.

3416
02:34:43,430 --> 02:34:44,490
The dog!

3417
02:35:01,210 --> 02:35:02,950
I said what I said.

3418
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:10,280
Oh my gosh.

3419
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:18,350
Well, I was trying to do that quest with the...

3420
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:20,410
I really wanna get rid of this thing.

3421
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:23,590
Well, I gotta put my hood back on him.

3422
02:35:23,810 --> 02:35:25,590
I wanna get rid of, uh...

3423
02:35:28,530 --> 02:35:29,010
The...

3424
02:35:30,810 --> 02:35:32,190
This rock shatter.

3425
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:33,510
Oh wait!

3426
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:34,930
It's not heavy at all!

3427
02:35:35,210 --> 02:35:35,910
Just kidding!

3428
02:35:36,610 --> 02:35:36,890
Huh!

3429
02:35:37,470 --> 02:35:39,510
I thought it was gonna be a million pounds!

3430
02:35:41,150 --> 02:35:43,150
It ain't easy, bangerine!

3431
02:35:44,830 --> 02:35:47,090
It's hard being so cute because...

3432
02:35:47,090 --> 02:35:48,290
...mocked by a wolf.

3433
02:35:53,330 --> 02:35:55,030
Quest items are weightless.

3434
02:35:55,230 --> 02:35:55,570
Oh!

3435
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:57,290
That's so smart!

3436
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:01,290
Well, I don't know where to go with it.

3437
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:03,670
They just act like I know this Melvin lady.

3438
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:07,670
Okay, well then...

3439
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:08,530
What do we do now instead?

3440
02:36:08,990 --> 02:36:10,130
Let's see, what's a different quest?

3441
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:11,650
Paranoia.

3442
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:13,470
Oh, I still gotta do that one.

3443
02:36:14,110 --> 02:36:15,230
I gotta go...

3444
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:17,190
Let's kill Tutius Sextius.

3445
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:20,010
North of town?

3446
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:21,230
Did I have the wrong farm?

3447
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,280
I'm south.

3448
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:30,080
North.

3449
02:36:35,090 --> 02:36:36,170
Wrong farm.

3450
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:36,590
Okay.

3451
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:37,750
Thank you guys.

3452
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:46,960
Uh...

3453
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:48,060
What's this?

3454
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:49,760
Oh, this is like one of the...

3455
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,560
altars.

3456
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:51,280
Oh!

3457
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:53,540
And there's a portal here.

3458
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:56,080
Would you look at that?

3459
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:00,040
Is that a dog?

3460
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:05,970
Dang it, that's close.

3461
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:09,750
Dang it!

3462
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:10,590
Don't move.

3463
02:37:11,350 --> 02:37:12,310
Don't walk.

3464
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:14,990
Dang it!

3465
02:37:15,250 --> 02:37:15,810
Don't walk.

3466
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,480
I got him.

3467
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:22,360
Took me a couple tries.

3468
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:24,520
Thank

3469
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:29,740
you, thank you.

3470
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:31,120
I appreciate it so much.

3471
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:39,010
Guys, is it bad that like...

3472
02:37:39,010 --> 02:37:41,010
my least favorite part of the game...

3473
02:37:42,310 --> 02:37:42,870
is...

3474
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:44,130
I got a lockpick.

3475
02:37:44,450 --> 02:37:46,510
Is going into the oblivion portals.

3476
02:37:48,790 --> 02:37:51,470
Is it bad that I like doing everything else...

3477
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:52,830
with the actual game?

3478
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:55,610
That's normal?

3479
02:37:55,910 --> 02:37:56,470
Is it really?

3480
02:37:58,830 --> 02:38:00,050
You're not alone.

3481
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:03,630
Like, I feel like I could do every side quest.

3482
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:06,530
Did it... did it register?

3483
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:07,430
The portal?

3484
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:09,670
Did it register?

3485
02:38:10,130 --> 02:38:11,330
Is it on my map?

3486
02:38:11,950 --> 02:38:12,790
Oh, it is.

3487
02:38:12,910 --> 02:38:13,270
Just kidding.

3488
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:14,770
Okay, goodbye.

3489
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,190
I don't want to fight any goblins.

3490
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:18,830
There's...

3491
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:19,990
two of them.

3492
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:21,430
Two portals.

3493
02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:22,490
Oh!

3494
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:24,070
I just said!

3495
02:38:24,970 --> 02:38:26,510
Why can't you listen to me?

3496
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:27,730
My...

3497
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:29,050
my wants and my needs.

3498
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:33,290
Stupid.

3499
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:44,680
I got like 200 hours in Skyrim, but I'm on mission three.

3500
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:44,920
Wait!

3501
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:49,360
That's the inn.

3502
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:51,160
Is it more north?

3503
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:59,570
I remember going to the inn before.

3504
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:03,270
Oh my gosh.

3505
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:05,910
Damn it!

3506
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:11,400
I can't live in peace on this...

3507
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:12,960
damn hell of an earth.

3508
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:16,160
I didn't mean to take the pelt, but whatever.

3509
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,940
North of town.

3510
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:22,820
Okay, I'll go back.

3511
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:31,560
Let's go athletics.

3512
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:34,640
Let's go athletics.

3513
02:39:39,730 --> 02:39:40,000
Okay.

3514
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:43,380
I'm heading back to town and then we'll head north of town.

3515
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:01,020
Uh oh.

3516
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:02,160
Ah!

3517
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:06,780
I'm lagging and I'm dying at the same time.

3518
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:15,070
Um...

3519
02:40:18,270 --> 02:40:20,490
That guy just got on a horse and ran away.

3520
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:25,330
Is that a friend?

3521
02:40:28,790 --> 02:40:29,310
Yeah.

3522
02:40:29,770 --> 02:40:31,150
We're right by the stables.

3523
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:31,870
He's gotta be.

3524
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:41,060
What is it now?

3525
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:41,840
Oh, okay.

3526
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:42,900
Leave me alone.

3527
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:46,040
Oh no, I'm starting to sound just like them!

3528
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:50,140
I'm starting to sound just like them!

3529
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:52,700
Where they greet me and I say, Don't talk to me!

3530
02:40:57,220 --> 02:40:58,560
Are you- Oh, Maeva!

3531
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,420
Oh, damn.

3532
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:04,420
Yalfi!

3533
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:11,280
Who- Who would leave you?

3534
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:13,180
Fighting's easy.

3535
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:17,060
Just lead them out on the water and shoot them full of holes.

3536
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:21,180
If you've got a bow, of course, and can walk on water.

3537
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:22,300
Yeah, she's single.

3538
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:22,800
Let's go.

3539
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,240
You think she's gonna take it well?

3540
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:25,580
Probably.

3541
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:26,560
Goddess!

3542
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:28,860
You have rock shatter already?

3543
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:30,940
And what's become of Yalfi?

3544
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:32,860
Yalfi's such a cute name.

3545
02:41:33,400 --> 02:41:35,320
I called him Bajalfi, didn't I?

3546
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:39,320
I don't- I don't know, no.

3547
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,640
I don't care to know you.

3548
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:42,280
Mint obliffated, probably.

3549
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:44,080
Sorry, Maeva.

3550
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:45,120
He's dead.

3551
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:45,980
Here, here, hold on.

3552
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:47,740
I'm putting my arms out.

3553
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:49,980
Come, come, come.

3554
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:51,760
Sob on my shoulder.

3555
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,460
It's okay.

3556
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:55,900
He was a good man when I married him.

3557
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:57,800
But greed took a hold of his heart.

3558
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:58,980
Oh, his greed seconds me.

3559
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:01,900
While I'm not happy he's dead, I'm glad he's at peace.

3560
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:07,480
Well, I'm just glad that it's all over and rock shatter is back where it belongs.

3561
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:08,940
In my family.

3562
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:10,320
She used glad two times?

3563
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:11,480
I feel I only use something for your efforts.

3564
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:13,140
She just learned about her dead husband?

3565
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:14,220
Hmm.

3566
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:14,420
Yes.

3567
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:18,280
I feel it only appropriate that you have my dowry.

3568
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:21,220
I would consider it an honor.

3569
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:24,580
Don't you get that when you marry someone?

3570
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:37,890
Maeva...

3571
02:42:40,310 --> 02:42:41,550
She's proposing?

3572
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,970
You're in?

3573
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:44,410
Does she like me?

3574
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:46,170
This better be good.

3575
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:47,190
Not really.

3576
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:53,270
Do you think I would have gotten more money from her if her disposition was up?

3577
02:42:53,850 --> 02:42:54,810
Well, bye.

3578
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,970
May the goddess watch you.

3579
02:42:58,010 --> 02:42:59,110
Yeah, she is.

3580
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:00,410
Holy cow.

3581
02:43:00,970 --> 02:43:02,190
Focus on the...

3582
02:43:02,890 --> 02:43:04,290
There's nothing to rake there.

3583
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:08,430
You need help harvesting?

3584
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:15,800
I don't think she was very sad.

3585
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:18,140
At all.

3586
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,740
She said, I'm glad two times.

3587
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:22,460
About...

3588
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:24,620
Once learning that her husband is dead.

3589
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:27,260
Vivicar, thank you so much for the gifted!

3590
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:31,820
Glad.

3591
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:33,640
She's glad glad.

3592
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:38,480
Well...

3593
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:41,320
That was the shortest quest ever.

3594
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:47,360
Can I get my horse back?

3595
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:48,580
I wonder where he is.

3596
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:51,060
Hello, Ernest.

3597
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:53,800
If you're looking to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Klisa.

3598
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:54,600
Ooh.

3599
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,280
You need to learn how to blink.

3600
02:43:57,420 --> 02:43:58,500
Stop talking.

3601
02:43:58,820 --> 02:44:00,760
I don't have my weapon out!

3602
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:02,500
Why does everybody hate me?

3603
02:44:06,770 --> 02:44:08,190
Oh my gosh.

3604
02:44:14,050 --> 02:44:14,850
Lord Grouses!

3605
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:16,310
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

3606
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:17,190
I'd rather not.

3607
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:18,370
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

3608
02:44:19,190 --> 02:44:19,970
Thank you guys!

3609
02:44:21,010 --> 02:44:21,450
How do you do?

3610
02:44:21,450 --> 02:44:21,650
How do you do?

3611
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:23,410
Welcome to the Horse Whisperer.

3612
02:44:23,470 --> 02:44:24,370
Oh my god, you did it.

3613
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:25,190
Are you interested in a horse?

3614
02:44:25,310 --> 02:44:26,050
Are you guys related?

3615
02:44:29,230 --> 02:44:31,870
We have the finest white horses in Cyrodom.

3616
02:44:32,550 --> 02:44:33,570
None are hardier.

3617
02:44:33,790 --> 02:44:36,610
And only the black horses of Chadenhall are faster.

3618
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:37,390
Hmm.

3619
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:40,810
How much- Four thousand gold!

3620
02:44:41,290 --> 02:44:43,290
My house was almost that much.

3621
02:44:43,630 --> 02:44:45,690
Then you should start saving for it right now.

3622
02:44:46,650 --> 02:44:47,170
Alright.

3623
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:48,270
You too.

3624
02:44:48,650 --> 02:44:49,230
You too.

3625
02:44:49,350 --> 02:44:50,030
I didn't say anything.

3626
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:59,750
Why is it so expensive to exist here?

3627
02:45:00,890 --> 02:45:01,910
Who's this guy anyway?

3628
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:08,390
Pinaris and Ventius, hunter, woodsman and marksman at your service.

3629
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:08,850
Oh.

3630
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:15,270
Plenty of deer, wolf, boar, mountain lion, bear in the county.

3631
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:17,090
Just need to know where to look for them.

3632
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:19,270
They don't...

3633
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:20,150
They don't...

3634
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:23,090
They don't think they like the inhabit...

3635
02:45:23,930 --> 02:45:25,570
Inhabit your skin thing.

3636
02:45:27,790 --> 02:45:28,530
No.

3637
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:32,430
Who wouldn't?

3638
02:45:33,590 --> 02:45:34,590
Seven months?

3639
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:36,550
Just found these.

3640
02:45:36,750 --> 02:45:37,050
Hi, bitch.

3641
02:45:37,290 --> 02:45:38,190
Hello, Mayhem.

3642
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:39,550
Thank you for seven months.

3643
02:45:40,940 --> 02:45:42,090
He can train me.

3644
02:45:42,090 --> 02:45:44,150
Teach, if you're willing to learn.

3645
02:45:44,590 --> 02:45:45,890
Into a marksman.

3646
02:45:46,050 --> 02:45:47,330
Wait, I think I'm good though, right?

3647
02:45:48,390 --> 02:45:49,130
Oh, yeah.

3648
02:45:49,230 --> 02:45:49,950
I'm better than you.

3649
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:50,810
You too.

3650
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:52,270
Alright.

3651
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:54,570
Let's go back to our quests, everybody.

3652
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:58,850
Let's go back to our quests.

3653
02:45:59,350 --> 02:46:00,930
We have many here.

3654
02:46:01,930 --> 02:46:03,490
This is a main quest.

3655
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:05,270
I don't care about Joffrey.

3656
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:07,390
Seeking your roots.

3657
02:46:09,250 --> 02:46:10,690
Join the Maiden's Guild.

3658
02:46:10,690 --> 02:46:10,750
Join the Maiden's Guild.

3659
02:46:12,210 --> 02:46:13,850
I already bought a house.

3660
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:15,730
I don't need to buy another one.

3661
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:18,130
There is Glarthur.

3662
02:46:19,150 --> 02:46:20,870
There's always Glarthur.

3663
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:29,490
The Elven Maiden?

3664
02:46:30,570 --> 02:46:33,690
Armand of the Thieves Guild asked me to steal the bust of...

3665
02:46:33,690 --> 02:46:34,990
La Tassa.

3666
02:46:37,170 --> 02:46:37,850
From...

3667
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:38,270
Cheyendo.

3668
02:46:42,630 --> 02:46:44,770
Maybe we go back to the Brotherhood.

3669
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:50,130
Maybe we do...

3670
02:46:50,870 --> 02:46:51,390
Oh, yeah.

3671
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:52,650
We turned into a vampire.

3672
02:46:52,910 --> 02:46:53,670
I forgot about that.

3673
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:59,140
Glarthur.

3674
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:04,500
For Glarthur, was it just Sextius Tutius that I needed to...

3675
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:05,000
Kill?

3676
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:06,200
Oh, wait.

3677
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:06,440
Sorry.

3678
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,500
Tutius Sextius?

3679
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:12,180
Atashi Vampaiya.

3680
02:47:19,310 --> 02:47:20,870
Was it just him, or...

3681
02:47:21,330 --> 02:47:23,210
I can't remember if I killed the other two.

3682
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:27,850
Actually, I don't think I killed the other...

3683
02:47:27,850 --> 02:47:28,090
Wait.

3684
02:47:34,770 --> 02:47:36,030
Also, one of the brothers.

3685
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:37,350
Okay.

3686
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:42,510
Yeah, I know I at least killed the lady.

3687
02:47:47,630 --> 02:47:48,710
Let's go double check.

3688
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:53,240
Da-da.

3689
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:54,520
Skin Grod.

3690
02:47:57,780 --> 02:47:59,040
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

3691
02:48:01,240 --> 02:48:04,120
I think I remember I killed the brothers...

3692
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,520
And then I got caught...

3693
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:10,660
Not for killing, but for...

3694
02:48:11,460 --> 02:48:11,880
Um...

3695
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:14,480
For looting, and I had to restart.

3696
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:20,780
I think I remember that happening.

3697
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:22,820
It was raining.

3698
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:25,160
Hello.

3699
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:26,740
Tilmo.

3700
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:33,650
Hello.

3701
02:48:33,650 --> 02:48:34,110
Yeah, hi.

3702
02:48:34,270 --> 02:48:35,530
It does make it hard to remember.

3703
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:36,930
I had to...

3704
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:39,490
Start and restart so many times.

3705
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:42,710
Okay.

3706
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:48,240
It was...

3707
02:48:50,890 --> 02:48:52,190
It's only showing me one.

3708
02:48:57,730 --> 02:48:59,070
Two sisters.

3709
02:48:59,650 --> 02:49:01,090
Two sisters.

3710
02:49:01,890 --> 02:49:02,830
Can I go through here?

3711
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:03,670
Alright.

3712
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:04,870
Nice.

3713
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:05,550
Skinny.

3714
02:49:07,870 --> 02:49:09,190
I have to go through there?

3715
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:18,230
I remember you tried poisoning them.

3716
02:49:18,230 --> 02:49:18,550
Um...

3717
02:49:19,230 --> 02:49:19,530
Yeah...

3718
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:21,630
What if I poisoned their food?

3719
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,610
What the?

3720
02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:23,970
This is where I just came from.

3721
02:49:24,210 --> 02:49:25,030
What is it now?

3722
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:28,090
Oh, they're here?

3723
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:32,940
What if I killed them here?

3724
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:42,560
He's on his horse.

3725
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:44,780
Where is my horse?

3726
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:49,420
Wait, he's like kind of far out, no?

3727
02:49:55,050 --> 02:49:55,750
It's you.

3728
02:49:56,150 --> 02:49:56,790
Hi.

3729
02:49:57,170 --> 02:49:57,430
Hi.

3730
02:49:58,170 --> 02:49:58,830
Bay horse.

3731
02:49:59,310 --> 02:49:59,390
What?

3732
02:49:59,910 --> 02:50:00,210
Ah!

3733
02:50:02,090 --> 02:50:02,470
Nothing.

3734
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:04,270
Good day.

3735
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:05,250
Good day.

3736
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:09,250
You can put a poison apple in their inventory?

3737
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:10,610
No way.

3738
02:50:16,510 --> 02:50:18,110
You can poison an apple?

3739
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:18,290
Ugh!

3740
02:50:19,370 --> 02:50:20,910
And then reverse pickpocket!

3741
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:23,190
Pickpocket!

3742
02:50:23,610 --> 02:50:24,210
Pickpocket!

3743
02:50:28,310 --> 02:50:28,930
Okay, hold on.

3744
02:50:29,230 --> 02:50:30,870
Let's just try this.

3745
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:32,570
I just quicksave, so...

3746
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:33,830
Where'd he go?

3747
02:50:35,790 --> 02:50:37,570
He's like kind of far, so...

3748
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:40,870
Oh.

3749
02:50:46,980 --> 02:50:47,760
Damn it.

3750
02:50:53,660 --> 02:50:54,960
Oh, I think he sees me.

3751
02:51:00,430 --> 02:51:01,970
Oh shoot, he's like...

3752
02:51:02,390 --> 02:51:02,790
Jacked.

3753
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:08,570
But if I kill him out here...

3754
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:10,530
Nobody will know.

3755
02:51:11,010 --> 02:51:11,850
Oh wait, he's running away.

3756
02:51:11,970 --> 02:51:12,090
Shoot.

3757
02:51:13,170 --> 02:51:13,570
Shoot.

3758
02:51:13,710 --> 02:51:14,130
No, come back.

3759
02:51:15,170 --> 02:51:15,730
Come back.

3760
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:16,910
Come back.

3761
02:51:17,130 --> 02:51:17,610
Don't leave.

3762
02:51:18,230 --> 02:51:18,770
Wait, Tutius!

3763
02:51:19,010 --> 02:51:19,930
Tutius, I didn't mean it!

3764
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:25,690
Oh shoot, I just got him into...

3765
02:51:27,250 --> 02:51:28,030
Nobody sees.

3766
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:30,410
Nobody sees.

3767
02:51:41,650 --> 02:51:43,730
Nobody sees.

3768
02:51:46,830 --> 02:51:48,210
Somebody sees.

3769
02:51:48,710 --> 02:51:49,850
I don't know who.

3770
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:52,990
Did I just...

3771
02:51:52,990 --> 02:51:54,530
Did I just do that?

3772
02:51:55,830 --> 02:51:56,890
Check your bounty.

3773
02:51:57,270 --> 02:51:57,590
Trill!

3774
02:51:59,690 --> 02:52:00,510
Trill.

3775
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:00,610
Trill.

3776
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:13,910
Good thing I quicksave, right?

3777
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:16,770
But nobody's coming to get me.

3778
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:20,330
Who saw?

3779
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:25,440
And if they work up the horse...

3780
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:28,830
You saw.

3781
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:33,210
If...

3782
02:52:33,210 --> 02:52:33,490
If...

3783
02:52:33,490 --> 02:52:34,070
I am a free!

3784
02:52:35,490 --> 02:52:36,250
If they...

3785
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:36,790
Oh, whoa, whoa.

3786
02:52:37,130 --> 02:52:38,790
If they saw it...

3787
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:39,890
They don't care!

3788
02:52:41,930 --> 02:52:43,310
I'm a free elf.

3789
02:52:50,010 --> 02:52:51,930
I could pay it off with the...

3790
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:53,130
Thieves Guild, right?

3791
02:52:54,110 --> 02:52:54,670
Wait...

3792
02:52:56,210 --> 02:52:57,450
Is that somebody there?

3793
02:52:57,770 --> 02:52:58,810
Oh, it is.

3794
02:52:58,810 --> 02:53:00,570
Do you think they saw me?

3795
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:06,570
No survivors!

3796
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:10,950
No...

3797
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:12,130
No...

3798
02:53:12,130 --> 02:53:12,930
No witnesses!

3799
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:15,630
Oops.

3800
02:53:21,140 --> 02:53:22,990
Why am I so bad at aiming today?

3801
02:53:29,490 --> 02:53:30,020
Oops.

3802
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:31,040
Over...

3803
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:32,480
Overestimated that.

3804
02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:39,470
Usually, I'm pretty good at sniping.

3805
02:53:39,890 --> 02:53:40,690
Today, I can't...

3806
02:53:40,690 --> 02:53:41,510
I can't get it at all.

3807
02:53:44,510 --> 02:53:45,190
Pretty penny.

3808
02:53:46,050 --> 02:53:46,790
What you got?

3809
02:53:48,630 --> 02:53:49,130
Oh, wait.

3810
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:50,370
Why am I doing all of this?

3811
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:51,690
Wait, I guess if I go...

3812
02:53:51,690 --> 02:53:52,190
Okay, hold on.

3813
02:53:52,510 --> 02:53:54,190
So, if I go to...

3814
02:53:54,570 --> 02:53:54,950
The...

3815
02:53:54,950 --> 02:53:56,770
The guild...

3816
02:53:57,890 --> 02:53:58,530
If I...

3817
02:53:58,530 --> 02:54:00,450
The horse, I think, really...

3818
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:04,330
You guys, the horse is following me.

3819
02:54:04,730 --> 02:54:06,470
I think it really is my witness.

3820
02:54:06,890 --> 02:54:07,110
Look!

3821
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:09,170
Look, it's still staring at me.

3822
02:54:11,110 --> 02:54:13,230
I think the horse is actually evil.

3823
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:20,390
The horse will attack me!

3824
02:54:20,810 --> 02:54:21,370
Oh my god.

3825
02:54:21,530 --> 02:54:21,870
Oh my god.

3826
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:22,390
Oh my god.

3827
02:54:23,850 --> 02:54:25,030
Oh my god.

3828
02:54:25,130 --> 02:54:25,910
Oh my god.

3829
02:54:25,950 --> 02:54:27,770
Oh my god.

3830
02:54:27,770 --> 02:54:27,910
Oh my god!

3831
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:37,550
This is...

3832
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:38,130
Umamusume.

3833
02:54:40,590 --> 02:54:42,230
Kimi no aiba ga...

3834
02:54:42,230 --> 02:54:42,790
No!

3835
02:54:44,810 --> 02:54:45,350
Don't leave.

3836
02:54:46,270 --> 02:54:47,930
Don't leave now, you coward.

3837
02:54:48,590 --> 02:54:49,990
Look at these full of holes.

3838
02:54:52,930 --> 02:54:55,050
I couldn't maybe get away with this.

3839
02:54:56,350 --> 02:54:57,570
How is it stealing?

3840
02:54:57,730 --> 02:54:58,170
They're mine.

3841
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:03,930
Wait, do they count as...

3842
02:55:03,930 --> 02:55:06,330
I might be able to get away with this, you guys.

3843
02:55:21,290 --> 02:55:22,930
I don't remember though.

3844
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:26,790
It was the Imperial City.

3845
02:55:28,410 --> 02:55:30,030
My game is starting to lag.

3846
02:55:30,270 --> 02:55:32,030
Probably because I'm doing evil deeds.

3847
02:55:33,410 --> 02:55:34,230
If I...

3848
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:36,070
I could maybe get away with this.

3849
02:55:39,950 --> 02:55:41,910
Me when my Uma fails with streaming.

3850
02:55:48,450 --> 02:55:50,250
Your infamy still goes up?

3851
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:51,370
I don't care.

3852
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:57,300
Yeah, I'm infamous.

3853
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,560
I'm part of the Dark Brotherhood.

3854
02:56:10,750 --> 02:56:10,810
Oh!

3855
02:56:16,570 --> 02:56:17,450
I'll swim there.

3856
02:56:18,350 --> 02:56:19,450
I'll swim, I'll swim.

3857
02:56:25,490 --> 02:56:26,530
I saw a guard.

3858
02:56:26,830 --> 02:56:27,950
I don't know if you guys saw him.

3859
02:56:28,470 --> 02:56:29,330
That's why I...

3860
02:56:29,770 --> 02:56:31,130
That's not my horse, is it?

3861
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:33,310
No, my horse had crazy armor, I remember.

3862
02:56:44,790 --> 02:56:46,310
Okay, he's gone.

3863
02:56:49,470 --> 02:56:50,550
Okay,

3864
02:57:00,210 --> 02:57:00,210
he's gone.

3865
02:57:00,210 --> 02:57:01,470
Sextiest tootiest!

3866
02:57:02,150 --> 02:57:03,610
Oops, sorry.

3867
02:57:03,610 --> 02:57:04,490
Dang it.

3868
02:57:04,610 --> 02:57:05,650
It's worthless to me anyway.

3869
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:06,470
I didn't mean to do that.

3870
02:57:06,590 --> 02:57:07,290
I'm so sorry.

3871
02:57:07,770 --> 02:57:08,710
You have been caught...

3872
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:23,100
Make it quick.

3873
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:25,600
You don't like me anymore, do you?

3874
02:57:25,900 --> 02:57:27,400
Cast out of the Thieves Guild!

3875
02:57:47,790 --> 02:57:51,650
You have been cast out for mistreating your fellow Thieves Guild members.

3876
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:56,170
In order to be returned to the roles, you must make reparations.

3877
02:57:56,530 --> 02:57:58,310
Are you ready to pay the fine?

3878
02:57:58,630 --> 02:57:59,530
My bounty!

3879
02:57:59,750 --> 02:58:00,250
Wait, hold on.

3880
02:58:01,090 --> 02:58:02,310
I'm still raising the money.

3881
02:58:02,390 --> 02:58:03,510
Then I have no use for you.

3882
02:58:03,730 --> 02:58:05,450
Be gone until you can pay the fine.

3883
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:06,490
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3884
02:58:06,490 --> 02:58:07,850
We can...

3885
02:58:07,850 --> 02:58:08,630
Okay, load...

3886
02:58:09,050 --> 02:58:09,830
The odd...

3887
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:10,330
Not...

3888
02:58:10,330 --> 02:58:11,310
Not...

3889
02:58:11,310 --> 02:58:12,290
The quick save.

3890
02:58:13,290 --> 02:58:14,030
Oh, wait.

3891
02:58:14,910 --> 02:58:16,630
It didn't autosave when I...

3892
02:58:17,470 --> 02:58:18,570
When I teleported?

3893
02:58:19,070 --> 02:58:19,730
Hold on.

3894
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:28,060
Hold on.

3895
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:30,960
It didn't autosave when I fast traveled?

3896
02:58:38,500 --> 02:58:39,680
Okay, hold on.

3897
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,200
It was right before...

3898
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:44,620
Okay.

3899
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:52,060
I have to hope that...

3900
02:58:52,060 --> 02:58:53,540
I didn't get...

3901
02:58:53,540 --> 02:58:54,120
Spotted.

3902
02:58:59,990 --> 02:59:02,230
I will not make the same mistake twice.

3903
02:59:04,650 --> 02:59:05,250
Okay.

3904
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:07,330
We can do the same thing we did before.

3905
02:59:10,010 --> 02:59:10,610
Okay.

3906
02:59:11,650 --> 02:59:12,250
Except...

3907
02:59:12,250 --> 02:59:13,970
When I walk up to him, I'm not sneaking.

3908
02:59:16,250 --> 02:59:17,110
Okay, okay.

3909
02:59:17,470 --> 02:59:18,310
We're fine.

3910
02:59:18,810 --> 02:59:19,990
Everything, this is...

3911
02:59:19,990 --> 02:59:21,070
This is fine.

3912
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:44,070
Okay.

3913
02:59:44,310 --> 02:59:45,170
I'm not sneaking.

3914
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:46,050
Talk.

3915
02:59:46,370 --> 02:59:47,110
Good to see you again.

3916
02:59:47,270 --> 02:59:47,470
Okay.

3917
02:59:47,970 --> 02:59:49,210
No big bucket!

3918
02:59:49,770 --> 02:59:50,970
Pay off my fines and bounty.

3919
02:59:51,230 --> 02:59:57,310
You can pay your fines to the guards, serve your time, or pay me half, and I'll fix them all.

3920
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:02,580
How much gold do I have?

3921
03:00:03,240 --> 03:00:05,940
It's your prison sentence, not mine.

3922
03:00:06,140 --> 03:00:07,020
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3923
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:07,560
Wait.

3924
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:08,380
Huh?

3925
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:08,440
Huh?

3926
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:09,080
Uh-oh.

3927
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:10,740
Shadow hide you.

3928
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:13,780
Oh, wait.

3929
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:14,300
That's not my gold.

3930
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:21,940
I'm broke.

3931
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:31,430
Okay.

3932
03:00:31,790 --> 03:00:31,970
Okay.

3933
03:00:31,970 --> 03:00:33,670
Hold on.

3934
03:00:34,530 --> 03:00:35,050
Okay.

3935
03:00:35,110 --> 03:00:35,430
Hold on.

3936
03:00:38,550 --> 03:00:39,150
Uh...

3937
03:00:39,850 --> 03:00:41,090
Sell the staff!

3938
03:00:41,470 --> 03:00:42,230
Oh my gosh, yes!

3939
03:00:43,250 --> 03:00:43,850
This...

3940
03:00:43,850 --> 03:00:44,950
Staff of flame!

3941
03:00:45,470 --> 03:00:46,950
Okay, who liked me?

3942
03:00:47,450 --> 03:00:48,310
I'm trying to think.

3943
03:00:49,830 --> 03:00:50,430
Uh...

3944
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:52,590
Uh...

3945
03:00:55,370 --> 03:00:55,970
Uh...

3946
03:00:55,970 --> 03:00:56,090
Uh...

3947
03:00:56,090 --> 03:00:56,650
Who was...

3948
03:00:56,650 --> 03:00:59,170
There was a guy that I sold really well to.

3949
03:01:00,210 --> 03:01:01,190
We do?

3950
03:01:01,590 --> 03:01:01,910
We?

3951
03:01:04,270 --> 03:01:05,930
Ah, you guys silly!

3952
03:01:06,630 --> 03:01:07,790
You guys are so silly.

3953
03:01:09,250 --> 03:01:10,610
Dude by the docks.

3954
03:01:10,710 --> 03:01:11,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3955
03:01:11,350 --> 03:01:12,190
That was a...

3956
03:01:12,190 --> 03:01:13,050
We go to Anvil.

3957
03:01:14,350 --> 03:01:15,850
We will make this right!

3958
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:21,710
Okay.

3959
03:01:22,550 --> 03:01:23,170
Anvil.

3960
03:01:28,130 --> 03:01:30,630
It was the dock gate, but we'll go to the lighthouse.

3961
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:31,970
I'm too scared of getting caught.

3962
03:01:40,790 --> 03:01:42,650
There should be no guards here.

3963
03:01:58,330 --> 03:02:00,350
I don't think there's any guards around though.

3964
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:21,620
It's so over!

3965
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:23,620
It's so over for me!

3966
03:02:40,530 --> 03:02:41,890
Who's attacking me?

3967
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:44,530
It's a pig!

3968
03:02:45,790 --> 03:02:46,590
Please!

3969
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:54,090
I'm just gonna drown myself in the water.

3970
03:02:59,510 --> 03:03:00,310
Guys!

3971
03:03:03,450 --> 03:03:04,850
What do we do?

3972
03:03:05,750 --> 03:03:07,270
There he is!

3973
03:03:12,580 --> 03:03:14,520
Am I still getting pursued?

3974
03:03:15,220 --> 03:03:16,500
By the pig?

3975
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:22,520
I think I have to F9.

3976
03:03:23,740 --> 03:03:25,980
And then not kill Tutius Sextius.

3977
03:03:28,580 --> 03:03:31,660
I think I made a grave error in judgment.

3978
03:03:32,620 --> 03:03:33,220
What is that?

3979
03:03:42,860 --> 03:03:44,660
You think he'll come get me in the water?

3980
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:48,300
That Mr. Pig.

3981
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:52,660
Alright, will you guys teach me how to do a poison apple?

3982
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:56,220
Will you guys teach me?

3983
03:04:07,910 --> 03:04:09,290
Should've never listened to Glarther.

3984
03:04:09,430 --> 03:04:10,930
Look, we're gonna get our money back!

3985
03:04:11,210 --> 03:04:12,110
From the house!

3986
03:04:12,330 --> 03:04:13,050
Well, not all of it.

3987
03:04:13,130 --> 03:04:14,630
But we're gonna get a good amount back.

3988
03:04:18,070 --> 03:04:19,750
You can buy them from the Brotherhood.

3989
03:04:19,990 --> 03:04:20,470
No kidding?

3990
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:24,790
Alright, we'll do that.

3991
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:25,310
Alright.

3992
03:04:26,270 --> 03:04:26,670
F9!

3993
03:04:26,670 --> 03:04:27,590
Ikimasu!

3994
03:04:27,590 --> 03:04:27,750
Ikimasu!

3995
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:34,580
It hurts.

3996
03:04:35,260 --> 03:04:36,180
It hurts!

3997
03:04:40,710 --> 03:04:42,290
Can't you just kill Glarther?

3998
03:04:43,450 --> 03:04:44,530
Wait, where is he?

3999
03:04:48,500 --> 03:04:49,560
Oh, where am I?

4000
03:04:52,300 --> 03:04:53,360
Oh, there he is!

4001
03:04:54,170 --> 03:04:55,660
I was so scared for a second!

4002
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:58,140
Oh my gosh, you're alive!

4003
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:59,260
Okay.

4004
03:05:01,780 --> 03:05:02,340
Okay.

4005
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:03,320
Alright, let's...

4006
03:05:03,320 --> 03:05:04,820
How do I buy from the Brotherhood?

4007
03:05:04,980 --> 03:05:06,360
I guess, uh, that one town...

4008
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:10,080
In...

4009
03:05:11,380 --> 03:05:12,360
The mountains.

4010
03:05:13,220 --> 03:05:13,780
Coral?

4011
03:05:14,140 --> 03:05:14,840
Was it...

4012
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:15,640
It was coral, right?

4013
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:17,240
The...

4014
03:05:18,890 --> 03:05:20,830
The place...

4015
03:05:20,830 --> 03:05:23,370
That I could...

4016
03:05:26,530 --> 03:05:27,290
The hideout.

4017
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:29,050
I don't think I've ever been to the hideout.

4018
03:05:35,350 --> 03:05:35,830
Here?

4019
03:05:38,510 --> 03:05:39,650
Oh, the Brotherhood!

4020
03:05:39,710 --> 03:05:39,970
Sorry!

4021
03:05:40,110 --> 03:05:40,650
I was thinking...

4022
03:05:40,650 --> 03:05:41,170
I'm stupid.

4023
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:43,630
I was thinking, um...

4024
03:05:44,350 --> 03:05:45,290
I'm so silly.

4025
03:05:45,630 --> 03:05:47,130
I was thinking of the...

4026
03:05:47,130 --> 03:05:48,350
The Thieves Guild.

4027
03:05:48,650 --> 03:05:49,530
Not the Brotherhood.

4028
03:05:50,690 --> 03:05:51,790
Yes, yes, yes.

4029
03:05:55,010 --> 03:05:56,310
That's why I was like, huh?

4030
03:05:56,550 --> 03:05:58,930
I've never been to the Thieves Guild hideout.

4031
03:06:00,590 --> 03:06:01,390
Let me in!

4032
03:06:05,530 --> 03:06:06,570
It's been a minute.

4033
03:06:06,790 --> 03:06:07,150
It's alright.

4034
03:06:07,390 --> 03:06:07,810
Thank you.

4035
03:06:07,950 --> 03:06:09,430
I always forget all these names, too.

4036
03:06:10,050 --> 03:06:10,890
Hey there, Skelly!

4037
03:06:11,350 --> 03:06:12,350
Dark Guardian?

4038
03:06:12,650 --> 03:06:13,710
Ah, Mr. Hair.

4039
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:16,610
Mr. Rogaine over there.

4040
03:06:17,670 --> 03:06:18,610
So sad.

4041
03:06:20,010 --> 03:06:23,190
And we searched for that lion guy that hates us.

4042
03:06:23,650 --> 03:06:24,370
I know.

4043
03:06:24,550 --> 03:06:25,070
I remember.

4044
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:26,350
You?

4045
03:06:26,530 --> 03:06:26,890
No, no.

4046
03:06:28,470 --> 03:06:30,010
Is that the rat I hear?

4047
03:06:30,010 --> 03:06:31,350
He he he he.

4048
03:06:31,350 --> 03:06:31,390
Yeah.

4049
03:06:32,010 --> 03:06:32,710
He he he he.

4050
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:36,330
Mr. Toupee.

4051
03:06:39,510 --> 03:06:40,930
I just, you know...

4052
03:06:40,930 --> 03:06:43,650
It's not that I'm shaming him for wearing a toupee.

4053
03:06:43,870 --> 03:06:44,950
For wearing a wig.

4054
03:06:45,370 --> 03:06:45,770
You know?

4055
03:06:46,190 --> 03:06:49,330
Do what makes you feel good about yourself.

4056
03:06:50,470 --> 03:06:52,490
But it's the fact that...

4057
03:06:53,310 --> 03:06:55,330
He looked so much better bald.

4058
03:06:56,170 --> 03:06:57,190
Bald is beautiful.

4059
03:06:57,870 --> 03:06:58,950
This is his room.

4060
03:07:00,250 --> 03:07:02,030
You can shame him.

4061
03:07:04,830 --> 03:07:06,450
He's probably in here.

4062
03:07:11,750 --> 03:07:14,450
Thank you, Minto, especially as someone who is balding.

4063
03:07:16,930 --> 03:07:17,450
Hello.

4064
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:18,370
You again?

4065
03:07:18,790 --> 03:07:18,970
Yep.

4066
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:20,070
I thought I'd made it clear.

4067
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:21,650
I am not looking for a friend.

4068
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:25,430
If you are here to buy or sell something, get on with it already.

4069
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:27,270
Can I still persuade...

4070
03:07:27,270 --> 03:07:28,550
Oh, I can't.

4071
03:07:28,710 --> 03:07:28,830
Okay.

4072
03:07:29,210 --> 03:07:29,610
Bartering.

4073
03:07:29,910 --> 03:07:31,110
You have...

4074
03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:34,090
Poisoned apple!

4075
03:07:34,590 --> 03:07:35,770
It's expensive.

4076
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:36,590
Wait.

4077
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:38,030
I can sell...

4078
03:07:39,450 --> 03:07:40,510
Will he...

4079
03:07:41,950 --> 03:07:42,590
Well...

4080
03:07:45,930 --> 03:07:47,570
It's only 186.

4081
03:07:53,310 --> 03:07:54,810
Can I still haggle?

4082
03:07:56,130 --> 03:07:57,090
I don't know.

4083
03:07:57,230 --> 03:07:57,610
I don't know.

4084
03:07:57,730 --> 03:07:59,970
I can't change his disposition at all.

4085
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:06,260
I don't think I could do 60%.

4086
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:09,900
It's 100?

4087
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:16,800
What if I do like 66?

4088
03:08:18,740 --> 03:08:20,420
Oh, it doesn't change that much.

4089
03:08:23,620 --> 03:08:25,480
I don't have that much money.

4090
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:27,460
If I sell...

4091
03:08:27,460 --> 03:08:28,000
Wait a second though.

4092
03:08:28,120 --> 03:08:29,400
If I sell the staff...

4093
03:08:29,400 --> 03:08:30,840
If I can sell it for 216...

4094
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:33,000
I will have enough.

4095
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:40,640
Poisoned apple.

4096
03:08:40,780 --> 03:08:41,540
Here I come, baby.

4097
03:08:47,250 --> 03:08:47,770
Oh...

4098
03:09:00,980 --> 03:09:02,040
There we go, okay.

4099
03:09:05,650 --> 03:09:07,210
And then we'll make more money.

4100
03:09:08,050 --> 03:09:09,450
And then we will...

4101
03:09:09,450 --> 03:09:10,290
Buy another one.

4102
03:09:11,150 --> 03:09:12,370
Yeah, I do need to.

4103
03:09:14,670 --> 03:09:15,710
I have...

4104
03:09:16,550 --> 03:09:17,070
Way...

4105
03:09:17,550 --> 03:09:19,830
I could sell the tome of end life.

4106
03:09:20,250 --> 03:09:21,410
I don't need that, right?

4107
03:09:21,910 --> 03:09:23,190
It just had two pages.

4108
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:33,700
And the cave diver's helmet.

4109
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:34,880
That's true.

4110
03:09:35,540 --> 03:09:36,860
We do have that.

4111
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:37,940
We do.

4112
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:43,680
Sell it after you read it.

4113
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:45,460
Just take your trinkets and go.

4114
03:09:45,800 --> 03:09:47,120
Ah, you love me.

4115
03:09:47,380 --> 03:09:48,720
Foul-smelling ape.

4116
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:52,340
He loves me, he loves me.

4117
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:54,300
Uh...

4118
03:09:54,880 --> 03:09:56,000
How do I read it?

4119
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:57,360
I thought I did read it.

4120
03:10:01,130 --> 03:10:02,750
See, this is all it is.

4121
03:10:04,330 --> 03:10:06,070
It is a fun accessory though.

4122
03:10:06,510 --> 03:10:07,690
Kinda wanted in my house.

4123
03:10:09,690 --> 03:10:10,610
Anyway, okay.

4124
03:10:10,930 --> 03:10:11,150
Whatever.

4125
03:10:11,410 --> 03:10:11,810
It's fine.

4126
03:10:12,850 --> 03:10:14,350
Let's go poison...

4127
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:16,070
That guy.

4128
03:10:17,370 --> 03:10:18,970
What's good is once we...

4129
03:10:18,970 --> 03:10:20,320
Once we poison the other people...

4130
03:10:22,790 --> 03:10:24,990
We can kill Glarther and nobody cares.

4131
03:10:27,510 --> 03:10:29,570
We can kill Glarther...

4132
03:10:29,570 --> 03:10:30,430
Rob his home...

4133
03:10:30,430 --> 03:10:31,830
And get lots and lots of money.

4134
03:10:34,710 --> 03:10:35,250
Alright.

4135
03:10:36,790 --> 03:10:38,890
Back to...

4136
03:10:39,470 --> 03:10:40,730
Here.

4137
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:47,660
Yeah.

4138
03:10:54,780 --> 03:10:56,180
Now where is he?

4139
03:11:01,260 --> 03:11:02,220
Up there?

4140
03:11:03,700 --> 03:11:04,400
Yes.

4141
03:11:07,840 --> 03:11:09,980
Why is this town so bizarre?

4142
03:11:15,320 --> 03:11:16,980
Oh, he's home!

4143
03:11:18,470 --> 03:11:19,080
Okay.

4144
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:21,180
I'm just gonna save again.

4145
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:27,610
I might be able to...

4146
03:11:29,090 --> 03:11:30,120
Peek pocket.

4147
03:11:36,380 --> 03:11:36,990
Hello?

4148
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:39,810
Yes?

4149
03:11:41,250 --> 03:11:42,070
What?

4150
03:11:42,450 --> 03:11:42,990
What?

4151
03:11:43,310 --> 03:11:43,570
What?

4152
03:11:44,290 --> 03:11:45,510
What?

4153
03:11:47,150 --> 03:11:48,370
Yes?

4154
03:11:48,370 --> 03:11:49,290
No!

4155
03:11:49,530 --> 03:11:51,070
That's what I have to ask you!

4156
03:11:52,210 --> 03:11:52,690
Bye.

4157
03:12:05,360 --> 03:12:06,280
Are you gonna...

4158
03:12:06,840 --> 03:12:07,400
Wait.

4159
03:12:07,740 --> 03:12:08,380
Oh my gosh.

4160
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:10,460
Maybe when he saw me before...

4161
03:12:10,460 --> 03:12:11,440
He was just like...

4162
03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:11,620
Wow.

4163
03:12:11,780 --> 03:12:12,540
She's so beautiful.

4164
03:12:13,360 --> 03:12:15,380
You're not gonna commit on me, are you?

4165
03:12:18,540 --> 03:12:19,660
You're not gonna...

4166
03:12:19,660 --> 03:12:20,600
Oh my gosh.

4167
03:12:21,140 --> 03:12:22,120
Tootie is sexiest.

4168
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:22,920
You're so close.

4169
03:12:29,270 --> 03:12:30,310
I'll come back.

4170
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:37,300
No time.

4171
03:12:37,380 --> 03:12:37,560
Oh!

4172
03:12:38,500 --> 03:12:39,480
It's red now.

4173
03:12:39,480 --> 03:12:40,340
It was not red.

4174
03:12:40,460 --> 03:12:40,960
You guys saw...

4175
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:41,900
He locked the door.

4176
03:12:55,610 --> 03:12:56,610
I see.

4177
03:12:57,930 --> 03:12:59,290
Well, there's the other person.

4178
03:12:59,550 --> 03:13:00,150
The brother.

4179
03:13:02,170 --> 03:13:03,490
We could get the brother first.

4180
03:13:03,490 --> 03:13:04,330
We can knock him out.

4181
03:13:07,330 --> 03:13:08,350
What time is it?

4182
03:13:09,490 --> 03:13:10,410
It's 10am.

4183
03:13:11,470 --> 03:13:12,190
I'm listening.

4184
03:13:12,490 --> 03:13:13,730
Maybe I just...

4185
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:14,110
I...

4186
03:13:14,110 --> 03:13:14,930
It was a...

4187
03:13:14,930 --> 03:13:16,030
I came too early.

4188
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:30,430
Ma'am, he's not into you.

4189
03:13:30,470 --> 03:13:31,590
You were just trespassing.

4190
03:13:32,510 --> 03:13:34,130
He ran down those stairs.

4191
03:13:34,310 --> 03:13:34,690
I don't know.

4192
03:13:34,750 --> 03:13:36,110
He seemed excited to see me.

4193
03:13:37,050 --> 03:13:37,490
Maybe.

4194
03:13:39,230 --> 03:13:40,070
I don't know.

4195
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:40,770
I don't know.

4196
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:45,400
That's him, right?

4197
03:13:45,400 --> 03:13:45,420
Okay.

4198
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:03,700
I always wanted to poison a brother.

4199
03:14:07,100 --> 03:14:08,400
This is him, right?

4200
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:08,980
Wait.

4201
03:14:09,180 --> 03:14:09,540
Hold on.

4202
03:14:09,980 --> 03:14:11,920
Now I can't remember the guy's name.

4203
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:13,160
We're just gonna...

4204
03:14:13,160 --> 03:14:15,180
We're just gonna kill an innocent man.

4205
03:14:17,960 --> 03:14:18,520
Wait.

4206
03:14:19,080 --> 03:14:19,520
Inspect.

4207
03:14:32,340 --> 03:14:34,020
Go to the sexist.

4208
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:37,460
We killed the lady.

4209
03:14:37,960 --> 03:14:38,280
Yes.

4210
03:14:38,460 --> 03:14:38,540
Okay.

4211
03:14:38,740 --> 03:14:38,900
David.

4212
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:40,340
Okay.

4213
03:14:45,200 --> 03:14:46,520
Now I...

4214
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:48,340
Give him the apple.

4215
03:15:02,170 --> 03:15:03,830
And now we would.

4216
03:15:10,030 --> 03:15:11,360
Oh my gosh, we did it.

4217
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:14,200
Oh my gosh, we did it.

4218
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:17,360
I think he has other food to eat.

4219
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:17,840
Oh.

4220
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:24,280
Take his other food to be sure.

4221
03:15:29,100 --> 03:15:29,620
Oh.

4222
03:15:29,820 --> 03:15:30,380
As bread.

4223
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:34,260
I wouldn't take it so bad.

4224
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:36,140
I will be good.

4225
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:37,300
I will be good.

4226
03:15:41,450 --> 03:15:41,970
Okay.

4227
03:15:43,950 --> 03:15:44,590
Okay.

4228
03:15:44,590 --> 03:15:45,430
Ha ha ha.

4229
03:15:46,590 --> 03:15:47,230
Hi.

4230
03:15:50,210 --> 03:15:52,950
Now how long until he gets hungry?

4231
03:15:53,570 --> 03:15:55,030
For a little snack?

4232
03:15:56,110 --> 03:15:56,530
Hi.

4233
03:15:56,850 --> 03:15:57,010
Hi.

4234
03:15:59,550 --> 03:16:05,150
I really wanna take his gold so I can buy another apple, but...

4235
03:16:11,570 --> 03:16:12,530
I wanna watch...

4236
03:16:17,890 --> 03:16:18,870
Okay, okay.

4237
03:16:18,870 --> 03:16:20,830
You can take it off his dead body.

4238
03:16:20,990 --> 03:16:21,150
True!

4239
03:16:22,610 --> 03:16:24,790
It's my birthday tomorrow, in case you don't stream tomorrow.

4240
03:16:24,890 --> 03:16:25,070
I'm gonna...

4241
03:16:25,070 --> 03:16:25,150
Oh!

4242
03:16:25,390 --> 03:16:26,150
Game Tavern!

4243
03:16:26,270 --> 03:16:26,930
Happy birthday!

4244
03:16:27,650 --> 03:16:29,190
I think I'll stream tomorrow.

4245
03:16:29,650 --> 03:16:30,830
I forgot to tell you guys.

4246
03:16:30,830 --> 03:16:31,790
I have my...

4247
03:16:31,790 --> 03:16:32,870
My, um...

4248
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:36,170
Throat doctor appointment this week.

4249
03:16:38,570 --> 03:16:39,050
So...

4250
03:16:39,610 --> 03:16:40,090
Hopefully...

4251
03:16:40,090 --> 03:16:41,170
Things are okay.

4252
03:16:41,710 --> 03:16:42,690
I will be good.

4253
03:16:42,690 --> 03:16:44,590
She says that she plans to murder a guy.

4254
03:16:44,830 --> 03:16:46,270
It's all part of the job.

4255
03:16:46,270 --> 03:16:47,010
I have...

4256
03:16:47,010 --> 03:16:48,450
Don't hate the player.

4257
03:16:48,450 --> 03:16:49,230
Hate the game.

4258
03:16:54,180 --> 03:16:56,580
Now I gotta get the tube down my throat.

4259
03:16:56,840 --> 03:16:57,360
I'm scared.

4260
03:16:58,200 --> 03:16:59,400
I'm scared!

4261
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:00,400
I'm scared!

4262
03:17:05,730 --> 03:17:07,090
I'm scared!

4263
03:17:07,090 --> 03:17:07,490
Brave.

4264
03:17:07,890 --> 03:17:09,390
I hope I don't throw up.

4265
03:17:12,130 --> 03:17:14,310
I don't have that fear of throwing up.

4266
03:17:14,890 --> 03:17:16,510
But I don't wanna throw up.

4267
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:21,560
I hope I...

4268
03:17:21,560 --> 03:17:22,820
I hope I get good pictures.

4269
03:17:23,320 --> 03:17:24,880
The gray fox protects you.

4270
03:17:25,120 --> 03:17:25,280
Bah!

4271
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:27,680
Don't look at me.

4272
03:17:28,520 --> 03:17:29,340
Good morning.

4273
03:17:29,420 --> 03:17:29,980
Where'd he go?

4274
03:17:30,580 --> 03:17:31,560
Tiding citizen.

4275
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:32,060
This way.

4276
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:34,380
Um...

4277
03:17:41,180 --> 03:17:42,260
Uh oh.

4278
03:17:42,680 --> 03:17:42,900
Wait.

4279
03:17:42,960 --> 03:17:43,740
I can't go inside.

4280
03:17:47,400 --> 03:17:48,900
And I'm being watched.

4281
03:18:00,340 --> 03:18:01,940
I wanted to watch it.

4282
03:18:02,100 --> 03:18:03,180
I wanted to watch him eat it.

4283
03:18:04,440 --> 03:18:05,240
Quick save.

4284
03:18:08,810 --> 03:18:09,350
Oh!

4285
03:18:10,890 --> 03:18:11,810
I went in.

4286
03:18:20,570 --> 03:18:21,110
Oh!

4287
03:18:24,210 --> 03:18:26,650
I'm David of Surili Brothers Vineyard.

4288
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:28,350
Gaston is my brother.

4289
03:18:28,670 --> 03:18:31,550
From our vineyards come the finest wines in Tamriel.

4290
03:18:32,250 --> 03:18:32,630
Hmm.

4291
03:18:33,290 --> 03:18:34,630
Finer than Tamika's?

4292
03:18:34,710 --> 03:18:35,030
Damn!

4293
03:18:35,690 --> 03:18:37,670
Yeah, well, in all honesty, no.

4294
03:18:37,950 --> 03:18:39,650
But our wines are very good.

4295
03:18:39,790 --> 03:18:43,410
And much cheaper than Tamika's very fine product, I assure you.

4296
03:18:46,190 --> 03:18:46,770
Rumors.

4297
03:18:47,030 --> 03:18:49,430
That Danas Artelian is a little too full of himself.

4298
03:18:49,970 --> 03:18:52,810
Sure, he's a captain of the guard, but I'm not impressed.

4299
03:18:53,670 --> 03:18:54,870
Are you hungry?

4300
03:18:56,450 --> 03:18:57,050
You too.

4301
03:18:58,610 --> 03:19:00,450
Okay, I don't think he wants me in here.

4302
03:19:01,110 --> 03:19:02,430
I hear a Nirn root.

4303
03:19:03,550 --> 03:19:04,330
Excuse me, sir.

4304
03:19:04,490 --> 03:19:05,650
I just want to inspect.

4305
03:19:07,350 --> 03:19:08,490
Wait, isn't it in here?

4306
03:19:09,490 --> 03:19:09,890
Oh.

4307
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:10,470
Nope.

4308
03:19:10,650 --> 03:19:10,970
It's not.

4309
03:19:13,130 --> 03:19:13,530
Ugh.

4310
03:19:17,390 --> 03:19:21,700
You think I can make it over there?

4311
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:24,140
Huh.

4312
03:19:26,500 --> 03:19:28,140
Oh, we're at the lodge.

4313
03:19:30,800 --> 03:19:34,080
How many times is this Nirn root going to get us?

4314
03:19:37,280 --> 03:19:38,900
Look, it's been a while, okay?

4315
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:40,920
It's been a while.

4316
03:19:45,070 --> 03:19:47,010
Well, I guess I can make some money.

4317
03:19:47,910 --> 03:19:49,830
Or find ways to make money.

4318
03:19:52,570 --> 03:19:53,130
Um...

4319
03:19:56,690 --> 03:19:58,230
So that, uh...

4320
03:19:59,170 --> 03:20:01,030
We can go buy the other apple.

4321
03:20:01,650 --> 03:20:02,390
You know?

4322
03:20:03,270 --> 03:20:05,150
I don't have time for you.

4323
03:20:05,310 --> 03:20:06,350
I'm a customer!

4324
03:20:08,670 --> 03:20:09,730
Well, not really.

4325
03:20:10,710 --> 03:20:12,970
Actually, how do I get out of your establishment?

4326
03:20:14,910 --> 03:20:16,410
Where is the front door?

4327
03:20:16,690 --> 03:20:17,230
Ma'am?

4328
03:20:20,070 --> 03:20:21,110
I'm lost.

4329
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:24,670
What?

4330
03:20:24,990 --> 03:20:25,370
How...

4331
03:20:25,370 --> 03:20:26,510
How do you...

4332
03:20:29,650 --> 03:20:31,410
Am I missing something?

4333
03:20:33,130 --> 03:20:34,630
This is the basement.

4334
03:20:36,850 --> 03:20:37,730
Second floor.

4335
03:20:37,870 --> 03:20:38,290
Second floor.

4336
03:20:38,470 --> 03:20:38,750
Second floor basement.

4337
03:20:41,030 --> 03:20:41,730
Up here?

4338
03:20:42,470 --> 03:20:42,910
Oh!

4339
03:20:49,370 --> 03:20:49,810
Uh...

4340
03:20:49,810 --> 03:20:50,030
Oh?

4341
03:20:52,670 --> 03:20:53,110
Wait.

4342
03:20:53,330 --> 03:20:53,870
No, I'm out.

4343
03:20:54,010 --> 03:20:55,670
I'm at the...

4344
03:20:55,670 --> 03:20:56,570
Oh, wait.

4345
03:20:56,590 --> 03:20:57,250
I went the wrong way.

4346
03:21:06,030 --> 03:21:06,590
Hey!

4347
03:21:07,750 --> 03:21:08,870
I found it.

4348
03:21:12,360 --> 03:21:14,760
When will we get the notification that he...

4349
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:15,200
Oh.

4350
03:21:15,980 --> 03:21:16,300
What?

4351
03:21:17,140 --> 03:21:17,700
What?

4352
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:19,180
Okay, hold on.

4353
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:20,120
I'm just gonna do it myself.

4354
03:21:24,940 --> 03:21:25,500
What?

4355
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:27,200
Uh,

4356
03:21:31,470 --> 03:21:34,070
I thought this was the door that went to the...

4357
03:21:35,350 --> 03:21:35,910
Ah...

4358
03:21:39,230 --> 03:21:41,450
How do we know for sure the guy is gonna eat the apple?

4359
03:21:42,530 --> 03:21:43,390
I don't know.

4360
03:21:45,890 --> 03:21:47,570
I'm being watched upon.

4361
03:21:47,830 --> 03:21:49,270
I quicksaved earlier, though.

4362
03:21:49,750 --> 03:21:50,490
Wait, is that Glarthur?

4363
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:51,390
He's not gonna...

4364
03:21:51,870 --> 03:21:53,210
He's not gonna rat me out.

4365
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:04,100
I quicksaved earlier, before we went into his house earlier, so...

4366
03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:06,680
And I didn't do anything, so...

4367
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:07,500
Ah, no!

4368
03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:08,000
What?

4369
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:22,840
We'll see.

4370
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:26,520
Ah!

4371
03:22:27,120 --> 03:22:27,500
Ah!

4372
03:22:27,960 --> 03:22:30,600
For the love of Azura, can't demand a bit of privacy?

4373
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:31,680
Get out of here!

4374
03:22:33,140 --> 03:22:33,660
Sorry.

4375
03:22:33,980 --> 03:22:35,440
He was waiting for me!

4376
03:22:41,780 --> 03:22:42,820
I see.

4377
03:22:43,440 --> 03:22:43,960
Okay.

4378
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:46,260
No.

4379
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:47,020
No, no.

4380
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:48,380
No, no, no, no!

4381
03:22:48,500 --> 03:22:49,560
Not again, please!

4382
03:22:51,580 --> 03:22:52,100
Bye!

4383
03:23:00,240 --> 03:23:00,800
Bye!

4384
03:23:01,360 --> 03:23:02,400
Oh, I do have enough money.

4385
03:23:04,940 --> 03:23:05,500
Haha!

4386
03:23:05,720 --> 03:23:05,980
You can!

4387
03:23:08,540 --> 03:23:10,080
He did see me...

4388
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:11,340
Lockpicking.

4389
03:23:17,620 --> 03:23:18,480
Oh, shoot!

4390
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:19,980
How are you?

4391
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:21,760
Hello.

4392
03:23:22,960 --> 03:23:24,920
I have another stream in 30 minutes.

4393
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:26,780
Well, guys...

4394
03:23:27,820 --> 03:23:28,260
I...

4395
03:23:29,240 --> 03:23:29,680
I...

4396
03:23:31,240 --> 03:23:31,400
I...

4397
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:31,440
Oh!

4398
03:23:31,740 --> 03:23:33,240
I wanted to see him die!

4399
03:23:35,240 --> 03:23:36,540
Tim, Tim, thank you!

4400
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:43,020
Streams have been helping me feel better.

4401
03:23:43,180 --> 03:23:44,920
I'm so sorry for your loss.

4402
03:23:45,880 --> 03:23:47,420
Glad I couldn't help a little bit.

4403
03:23:47,420 --> 03:23:47,700
But...

4404
03:23:48,640 --> 03:23:51,680
Itina looks like a Uma when sprinting third person.

4405
03:23:51,900 --> 03:23:52,560
She does!

4406
03:23:54,140 --> 03:23:55,420
We're never gonna get...

4407
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:56,060
I feel like...

4408
03:23:56,060 --> 03:23:58,460
I will only finish this damn Glarther quest...

4409
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:02,140
When I finish Oblivion.

4410
03:24:03,700 --> 03:24:06,100
I feel like this is the final boss.

4411
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:08,080
This stupid quest.

4412
03:24:09,300 --> 03:24:09,780
Dang.

4413
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:12,060
Well, guys, I have another stream in 30 minutes.

4414
03:24:12,220 --> 03:24:13,700
But it is a Membu stream.

4415
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:17,540
So, if you also wanna come watch a movie with me...

4416
03:24:17,540 --> 03:24:18,060
Movie...

4417
03:24:18,060 --> 03:24:18,980
Sunday night movie.

4418
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:22,340
We're gonna be watching Legally Blonde.

4419
03:24:22,480 --> 03:24:23,980
Cause I wanted to watch that movie.

4420
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:26,660
Cause I saw somebody watching it on the plane.

4421
03:24:26,660 --> 03:24:28,400
And then I would...

4422
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:28,700
Fall asleep.

4423
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:29,340
And I'd wake up.

4424
03:24:29,380 --> 03:24:30,400
I'd be like, where are they at?

4425
03:24:30,660 --> 03:24:31,620
Oh, they're at this part.

4426
03:24:32,540 --> 03:24:33,920
Sorry, I'm falling asleep again.

4427
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:35,620
I'd fall asleep, wake up, be like...

4428
03:24:35,620 --> 03:24:36,780
Oh, they're at this part of the movie.

4429
03:24:36,980 --> 03:24:37,720
Fall asleep, wake up.

4430
03:24:37,900 --> 03:24:39,220
Oh, they're at this part of the movie.

4431
03:24:40,460 --> 03:24:40,820
Murphy!

4432
03:24:41,520 --> 03:24:42,460
Thanks for the vibe, Grypton.

4433
03:24:47,360 --> 03:24:47,720
So...

4434
03:24:47,720 --> 03:24:48,020
Hmm.

4435
03:24:48,820 --> 03:24:49,540
Legally green.

4436
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:51,480
Yeah.

4437
03:24:54,400 --> 03:24:54,760
It's...

4438
03:24:55,400 --> 03:24:55,760
C2!

4439
03:24:57,280 --> 03:24:58,560
Thank you for the vibe, Grypton.

4440
03:24:58,820 --> 03:24:59,220
Si Si!

4441
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:02,440
Thank you for the Grypton!

4442
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:04,160
Mariel, thank you for the...

4443
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:05,780
Welcome to contrary finding assessments, thank you.

4444
03:25:09,300 --> 03:25:10,380
Harry, welcome back.

4445
03:25:10,500 --> 03:25:12,120
Thank you so much for fifteen months...

4446
03:25:12,120 --> 03:25:12,440
Thank you.

4447
03:25:12,700 --> 03:25:13,960
Hunter, thank you for the Grypton.

4448
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:16,820
One month until one year.

4449
03:25:17,380 --> 03:25:18,120
Thank you!

4450
03:25:18,520 --> 03:25:18,560
Spike!

4451
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:22,920
Let me jadi a little bit hmm, this is your question.

4452
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:24,240
Well...

4453
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:25,460
Um...

4454
03:25:25,460 --> 03:25:28,200
Oh my gosh, these three hours flew by.

4455
03:25:28,680 --> 03:25:31,300
We did a little bit of cave, dungeon diving.

4456
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:32,880
A little tiny bit.

4457
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:34,360
We...

4458
03:25:34,770 --> 03:25:36,100
We did some quests.

4459
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:37,700
We got our house?

4460
03:25:37,960 --> 03:25:38,820
That was huge.

4461
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:43,160
We finally got our haunted house.

4462
03:25:46,240 --> 03:25:47,920
Yeah, that was a big one.

4463
03:25:51,010 --> 03:25:54,050
The words legally blind made me join me.

4464
03:25:54,310 --> 03:25:55,170
Thank you.

4465
03:25:56,310 --> 03:25:58,190
West English Face, thank you so much for the five.

4466
03:25:58,650 --> 03:26:00,630
Valentine, thank you so much for the ten.

4467
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:02,730
Come watch Legally Blonde.

4468
03:26:02,790 --> 03:26:04,370
Have you never seen Legally Blonde before?

4469
03:26:04,510 --> 03:26:05,430
It's a really good movie.

4470
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:07,270
Targo, thank you so much for the five.

4471
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:07,790
It gets in.

4472
03:26:08,410 --> 03:26:09,190
Prince of Denmark.

4473
03:26:09,470 --> 03:26:10,610
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Akosupa.

4474
03:26:11,130 --> 03:26:13,550
One of the Senna, congratulations on all your recent successes.

4475
03:26:13,750 --> 03:26:15,390
I loved watching you sing with Kiara.

4476
03:26:29,010 --> 03:26:31,210
We have had some W's lately.

4477
03:26:33,430 --> 03:26:34,770
Okay, so thank you for the five.

4478
03:26:35,270 --> 03:26:36,550
Bloodless, thank you for the ten gifted.

4479
03:26:38,330 --> 03:26:39,110
Thank you for the three.

4480
03:26:39,270 --> 03:26:40,690
We don't can't wait to watch a movie with you.

4481
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:43,310
I'm excited.

4482
03:26:48,070 --> 03:26:48,710
50 empty.

4483
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:50,110
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

4484
03:26:52,310 --> 03:26:53,830
Hard working ghost.

4485
03:26:54,030 --> 03:26:55,070
I'm trying.

4486
03:26:55,570 --> 03:26:56,310
I'm trying.

4487
03:26:56,890 --> 03:26:58,670
Zest, thank you for the five gifted.

4488
03:27:13,630 --> 03:27:15,530
I can be unlucky ghost.

4489
03:27:15,530 --> 03:27:17,510
Some times.

4490
03:27:19,450 --> 03:27:21,950
Did you tell me so much for that doggy gift?

4491
03:27:26,490 --> 03:27:28,210
You're doing great.

4492
03:27:28,490 --> 03:27:29,170
Thank you.

4493
03:27:30,150 --> 03:27:31,510
I'm succeeding.

4494
03:27:41,930 --> 03:27:43,430
Thank you guys.

4495
03:27:43,910 --> 03:27:45,970
Thank you for the 20.

4496
03:27:46,990 --> 03:27:48,170
Thank you.

4497
03:27:49,050 --> 03:27:52,130
I'm gonna go watch Legally Blonde in a half hour.

4498
03:27:53,090 --> 03:27:54,870
I gotta make a way to move.

4499
03:27:56,070 --> 03:27:57,470
Thumbnail, but I'm lazy.

4500
03:28:02,100 --> 03:28:03,500
Thank you so much for everything.

4501
03:28:03,640 --> 03:28:04,340
Thank you.

4502
03:28:05,500 --> 03:28:06,240
Thank you.

4503
03:28:06,380 --> 03:28:06,720

4504
03:28:06,860 --> 03:28:07,200

Thank you for so much.

4507
03:28:08,320 --> 03:28:09,540
Thank you guys.

4508
03:28:11,620 --> 03:28:19,060
Well... Um... Um... Uh... I think... Wait.

4509
03:28:19,280 --> 03:28:19,520
Hold on.

4510
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:21,880
I shouldn't be sitting here with... Hold on.

4511
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:22,580
What are we gonna do?

4512
03:28:23,440 --> 03:28:26,440
We're gonna wait a whole 12 hours.

4513
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:29,860
And see if he eats within that time.

4514
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:37,000
Happy birthday!

4515
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:45,820
Seriously?

4516
03:28:52,460 --> 03:28:53,420
It's you.

4517
03:28:53,800 --> 03:28:54,440
Hi.

4518
03:28:54,620 --> 03:28:55,620
I don't know who you are.

4519
03:29:04,810 --> 03:29:07,990
Uh... We're going to wait another 12 hours.

4520
03:29:14,070 --> 03:29:18,070
Yeah, I know he has food at his house, so... I guess we'll see.

4521
03:29:28,830 --> 03:29:29,910
Is that Glarthor?

4522
03:29:30,430 --> 03:29:31,710
Um... No time to talk.

4523
03:29:36,470 --> 03:29:36,950
Okay.

4524
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:40,550
Wait.

4525
03:29:40,630 --> 03:29:41,370
Is that him right there?

4526
03:29:41,890 --> 03:29:42,330
Dang it.

4527
03:29:42,370 --> 03:29:44,170
I was about to bust into your house.

4528
03:29:45,730 --> 03:29:46,210
No.

4529
03:29:46,270 --> 03:29:46,470
Well met.

4530
03:29:46,790 --> 03:29:47,250
No!

4531
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:48,230
Eat!

4532
03:29:48,330 --> 03:29:49,550
What's wrong with you?

4533
03:29:52,170 --> 03:29:54,290
David, you'll always be...

4534
03:29:54,290 --> 03:29:57,230
You got to put some muscle on that bone...

4535
03:29:57,230 --> 03:29:57,790
Mister!

4536
03:29:58,550 --> 03:29:58,750
No!

4537
03:30:01,710 --> 03:30:03,690
Check if he still has it.

4538
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:05,130
He better.

4539
03:30:05,870 --> 03:30:08,470
I spent 400 gold on it.

4540
03:30:21,530 --> 03:30:22,510
Here he comes.

4541
03:30:22,710 --> 03:30:23,450
He's running at me.

4542
03:30:24,630 --> 03:30:25,390
I think.

4543
03:30:30,520 --> 03:30:31,360
No, he's not.

4544
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:31,920
He didn't notice.

4545
03:30:34,680 --> 03:30:35,240
Wait.

4546
03:30:35,340 --> 03:30:35,760
Where is he?

4547
03:30:36,240 --> 03:30:37,260
Not... Not out here.

4548
03:30:45,770 --> 03:30:47,190
Yeah, he still has it.

4549
03:30:48,770 --> 03:30:49,370
Hmm.

4550
03:30:49,990 --> 03:30:51,430
Maybe I should take his other food.

4551
03:30:57,300 --> 03:30:59,420
Let's steal his other food from the house.

4552
03:31:16,270 --> 03:31:16,870
Alright.

4553
03:31:22,480 --> 03:31:23,920
A people's princess.

4554
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:28,880
What if he doesn't like apples?

4555
03:31:33,590 --> 03:31:34,190
Hello.

4556
03:31:34,490 --> 03:31:35,390
Do you need something?

4557
03:31:37,110 --> 03:31:38,010
I do.

4558
03:31:38,010 --> 03:31:39,390
I need some money.

4559
03:31:39,410 --> 03:31:40,890
Can't you see that I'm very busy?

4560
03:31:41,490 --> 03:31:42,150
So long.

4561
03:31:42,570 --> 03:31:43,730
Glarder is so rude.

4562
03:31:44,170 --> 03:31:45,750
I can't wait to kill this guy.

4563
03:31:46,310 --> 03:31:46,770
Ha ha ha.

4564
03:31:49,150 --> 03:31:53,350
According to the wiki, he has respawning bread in his inventory, so he won't eat the apple.

4565
03:31:58,040 --> 03:31:58,900
No way.

4566
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:01,220
Greetings.

4567
03:32:01,580 --> 03:32:05,600
A small number of NPCs are effectively immune to poison apples because...

4568
03:32:06,240 --> 03:32:08,680
because they carry a self-replenishing supply of food.

4569
03:32:12,230 --> 03:32:13,490
take it back.

4570
03:32:24,810 --> 03:32:26,110
No time to talk.

4571
03:32:26,610 --> 03:32:26,830
No.

4572
03:32:29,210 --> 03:32:29,930
No!

4573
03:32:30,910 --> 03:32:31,630
I...

4574
03:32:37,510 --> 03:32:38,690
Wait, hold on.

4575
03:32:38,970 --> 03:32:40,170
I'm gonna F9 again.

4576
03:32:43,190 --> 03:32:44,610
Oh my gosh.

4577
03:32:51,850 --> 03:32:53,290
I'm just gonna go inside.

4578
03:32:56,370 --> 03:32:57,090
Okay.

4579
03:32:57,090 --> 03:32:57,610
Let's see.

4580
03:33:03,310 --> 03:33:05,550
I'm seeing if he's running downstairs to us.

4581
03:33:07,630 --> 03:33:08,230
Sorry.

4582
03:33:09,630 --> 03:33:11,610
Why didn't he run down before?

4583
03:33:11,930 --> 03:33:12,710
I don't understand.

4584
03:33:17,230 --> 03:33:17,810
Hello.

4585
03:33:19,290 --> 03:33:19,870
Goodbye.

4586
03:33:23,570 --> 03:33:25,190
This is too difficult.

4587
03:33:38,180 --> 03:33:39,040
Let's hear it.

4588
03:33:43,180 --> 03:33:44,680
This is so tough.

4589
03:33:46,980 --> 03:33:49,380
Okay, but the only one who sees me is Glarthur.

4590
03:33:49,740 --> 03:33:51,600
Okay, he doesn't see me anymore.

4591
03:33:56,560 --> 03:33:59,400
But he wouldn't... he wouldn't snitch, right?

4592
03:34:08,790 --> 03:34:10,350
He wouldn't snitch, right?

4593
03:34:12,630 --> 03:34:13,790
Get out of here.

4594
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:18,350
Okay.

4595
03:34:20,470 --> 03:34:21,970
I give up for today.

4596
03:34:22,750 --> 03:34:23,830
I give up.

4597
03:34:25,330 --> 03:34:32,330
For next time, let's remember to get the apple and we'll give the apple instead to...

4598
03:34:32,330 --> 03:34:33,950
Tutius Sextius.

4599
03:34:34,910 --> 03:34:37,350
I should have given it to him to begin with.

4600
03:34:37,550 --> 03:34:39,330
I should have just gone with the original plan.

4601
03:34:40,590 --> 03:34:41,490
Dang it.

4602
03:34:42,510 --> 03:34:43,130
Well, thank you, guys.

4603
03:34:43,570 --> 03:34:44,030
Whoever...

4604
03:34:45,490 --> 03:34:47,790
Searched for me that...

4605
03:34:49,450 --> 03:34:49,910
That...

4606
03:34:49,910 --> 03:34:51,790
We couldn't...

4607
03:34:51,790 --> 03:34:53,290
That he had the re...

4608
03:34:54,350 --> 03:34:56,330
The respawning bread, so...

4609
03:35:03,690 --> 03:35:05,570
I can't believe...

4610
03:35:05,570 --> 03:35:07,490
I can't believe he's going to live.

4611
03:35:08,890 --> 03:35:10,770
Tutius Sextius lives another day.

4612
03:35:16,020 --> 03:35:18,640
If only I had enough money to pay off my bounty.

4613
03:35:19,460 --> 03:35:20,300
But, you know...

4614
03:35:20,300 --> 03:35:22,440
We can't live in what ifs.

4615
03:35:23,960 --> 03:35:25,520
We can't live in what ifs.

4616
03:35:25,600 --> 03:35:28,640
This is an insane setup you got going on here, buddy.

4617
03:35:30,540 --> 03:35:30,860
Okay.

4618
03:35:31,440 --> 03:35:31,740
Well, anyway.

4619
03:35:31,920 --> 03:35:33,340
Thank you, guys, for more Oblivion.

4620
03:35:33,500 --> 03:35:34,380
This was a lot of fun.

4621
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:35,520
I will see you guys...

4622
03:35:37,640 --> 03:35:38,360
Maybe in a bit.

4623
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:39,180
And if not, in a bit.

4624
03:35:39,240 --> 03:35:40,440
Then I'll see you when I see you next...

4625
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:41,840
Otzavito!

4626
03:35:45,500 --> 03:35:45,820
Otzavito.

4627
03:35:46,020 --> 03:35:46,360
Do I go?

4628
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:47,040
Thank you.

4629
03:35:47,580 --> 03:35:47,920
Thank you.

4630
03:35:48,040 --> 03:35:48,460
Thank you.

4631
03:35:48,460 --> 03:35:50,420
Thank you, guys, as always...

4632
03:35:50,420 --> 03:35:51,840
All the donos...

4633
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:53,720
And all the members...

4634
03:35:53,720 --> 03:35:54,260
And...

4635
03:35:54,900 --> 03:35:55,340
Everything...

4636
03:35:55,340 --> 03:35:56,400
Super chats...

4637
03:35:56,400 --> 03:35:57,340
Thank you for watching!

4638
03:35:57,500 --> 03:35:58,740
Thank you for hanging out with me!

4639
03:35:59,900 --> 03:36:02,100
And I will see you when I see you next...

4640
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:03,780
Otzavito!

4641
03:36:05,020 --> 03:36:05,460
Iã£ã¦ãã£ããã!

4642
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:06,300
Bye-bye!

4643
03:36:06,740 --> 03:36:07,820
Bye-bye, bye-bye...

4644
03:36:07,820 --> 03:36:08,240
Buh-bye!

4645
03:36:08,240 --> 03:36:09,240
Bye!
