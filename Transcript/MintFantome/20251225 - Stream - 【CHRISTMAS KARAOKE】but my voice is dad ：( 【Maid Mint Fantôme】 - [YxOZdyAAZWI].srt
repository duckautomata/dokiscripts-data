I got the thumbnail recommended after a clip and I said you

00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,870
Let me, hold on, let me see if I can read it.

211
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,990
Don't worry, I'm not sick.

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,650
Just overworked.

213
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,770

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

226
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:20,480
Um, I went to, I went to, uh, so I had, at the Sunday collab
with with Mimi, Barry and Ashton.

227
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,100
And then the day after we all went to, we all went to Disney
together.

228
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,920
And then the day after that, I was like, I don't think I've
had enough theme park.

229
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,440
So it was like, it was like afternoon.

230
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,980
I was like, I think I'm gonna go to SeaWorld.

231
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,160
And so I went to SeaWorld.

232
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:53,720
And then I was like, you know, I think, I think I might want
to, um, also, um, want to go to theme park today.

233
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,660
Uh, I almost went to epic.

234
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,420
Did you see the orcas?

235
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,660
No, my gosh, orca.

236
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,960
There were so many signs that were like this way to the orca
zone.

237
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,300
And I was like, oh my gosh, it's just going to be full of
Yuri.

238
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,040
I was thinking of you the whole time, my wife.

239
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,500
But man, are my arms tired?

240
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,120
No, SeaWorld was so funny.

241
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,700
I went, I remember, okay.

242
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,360
There was one ride at SeaWorld that I thought was out of
operation now.

243
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,660
It's called Journey to Atlantis.

244
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,920
And I went on it once as a wee wisp.

245
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,020
And I remember it was, so I was too small to...

246
00:24:49,400 --> 00:25:01,580
ride Kraken right and so I was like well this is the only
thrilling ride that I can ride here so it was like my

247
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:09,080
favorite thing journey to Atlantis and I remember like you
would go in and there would be like the projection of the

248
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,540
face on the mermaid and they're like you must set me free
I've been turned to stone by Medusa and then there was like

249
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:24,800
a little seahorse guy that was like and and she's like you
will never leave and i i was like oh my gosh i can't wait to

250
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:38,480
relive all of this and i get on this ride guys everything
was broken the story was removed yes the story was removed

251
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:50,520
and everything was broken i was so sad medusa lit up but she
was supposed to like lean towards do and be all spooky i was

252
00:25:50,520 --> 00:26:01,420
so it was so disappointing and then also to like fulfill my
inner my inner baby wisp i went on kraken because i was like

253
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:16,640
finally i could do it no it was okay it was okay the park
itself was great but um yeah it's definitely uh

254
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,000
sea world has kind of fallen off recently even over here in
california it wasn't so it wasn't

255
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:40,140
it wasn't so good but there was one thing um uh someone
mentioned the flying dinosaur at universal there was a ride

256
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:50,540
there's a peter peter sorry a peter dactyl ride i usj
universal studios japan that i really wanted to ride that i

257
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:59,900
was like oh But it was so cold that I, like the whole group
I was with, we were like, we were like, no, it's too cold

258
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,880
for this, I think.

259
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,240
And so we skipped it.

260
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,780
And I was like, I'm kind of regretting it.

261
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,620
And I brought this up.

262
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,840
And someone that I know that works on roller coasters and
stuff is like, oh, if you go to SeaWorld, there's one that's

263
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
exactly like it.

264
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,440
And so I was just like, I was like, oh, I'll go ride that.

265
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,740
And it's called Manta.

266
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
It was really good.

267
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,260
That mantle was so, so good.

268
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,700
It was really crazy.

269
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,460
It really felt like you were...

270
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't know if it's a similar track to the pterodactyl one.

271
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,200
But...

272
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,140
Oh my gosh, Capo!

273
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,320
It's super...

274
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,000
Thank you.

275
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,900
Thank you.

276
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,280
Thank you.

277
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,760
Thank you.

278
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,280
Roller coaster cloning is pretty common.

279
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,100
Yeah, exactly.

280
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,620
So I figured now that I've written that, I know the
pterodactyl one pretty well.

281
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,000
It was so fun.

282
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,700
Merry Christmas, boss, and all the I booze tonight.

283
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,880
Yeah, I'll put your karaoke on my TV while my family enjoys
hot pot and blue label expensive whiskey.

284
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,820
Ooh, fancy.

285
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,960
Uh-oh, I should sing then some more, huh?

286
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Manta is insane.

287
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,600
It was so fun because, like, you, when you do the loop,
like, you are pushed back.

288
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:20,880
So basically the ride, um, to give anybody who doesn't know
it, um, you are sitting in the seat and then the seat goes

289
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,380
back.

290
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,280
So you're, you're facing the ground.

291
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:32,020
your face is facing the ground and you're like kind of you
know really trusting that harness there i was like oh my

292
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,600
gosh it would be so inconvenient if my if the person i
possessed fell out and died and i would have to find another

293
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,800
body to possess you know um because this body doesn't throw
up over on roller coasters so it's kind of like annoying to

294
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,260
have to find another body but anyway yeah it's really
inconvenient so

295
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,200
So, yeah, you're like facing the ground and you're looking
at it and you're like, wow, this is so scary.

296
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,500
But there's a loop in it.

297
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,340
And when the loop happens, you're like pushed back to the
back of your seat.

298
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,200
And it's like, it's such a crazy, weird floaty, floaty,
floaty feeling.

299
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,060
So, you can borrow mine.

300
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,440
Okay.

301
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,340
What's another song I should sing?

302
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
What's another song?

303
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,940
Sad after Christmas.

304
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,020
No, don't be sad.

305
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,800
Don't be sad.

306
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
I'll sing Happy Santa.

307
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,680
Christmas songs only, everybody.

308
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,720
Last Christmas?

309
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,840
Like, that's kind of like a sad song, though, no?

310
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,460
I'll try it.

311
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,620
You're a Bukami Tai covered.

312
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,920
Oh, I typed all the wrong thing.

313
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,580
Last Christmas.

314
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,100
Christmas song only, everybody.

315
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,740
Sorry, I don't know any Hanukkah songs.

316
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,600
I guess holiday songs only, but I think I only know
Christmas.

317
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,230
Let's try this one.

319
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,890
There's words here.

320
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,140
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but the

321
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:51,760
best this year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to

This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:41,630
Once bitten and twice shy I keep my distance, but you still
catch my eye Tell me, baby, do you recognize?

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice.

334

My God, I thought you were someone to rely on me.

335
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,620
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

336
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,640
Face on a lover with a fire in his heart.

337
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,460

claw marks on her back oh my god grandma got run over by a

509
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:28,590
reindeer walking home from a Christmas Eve.

510
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,350
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

511
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,420
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

512
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,950
I don't think they have claw marks.

513
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:41,670
We're all proud of Grandpa.

514
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:42,310
Why?

515
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,690
He's been taking this so well.

516
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:54,310
See him in there watching football, drinking beer and
playing cards with Cousin Mel.

517
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,850
It's not Christmas without grandma.

518
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,110
All the families trust in black.

519
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:12,410
And we just can't help but wonder, should we open up her
gifts or send them back?

520
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,650
Look at why does the crowd say send them back.

521
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:24,890
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

522
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,670
And as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

523
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:34,170
Outsu, arigato, now the goose is on the table.

524
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,490
And the pudding made.

525
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,060
And the blue and silver candles.

526
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,140
That would have matched the hair in Grandma's wig.

527
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,520
I've warned all my friends and neighbors.

528
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,840
You better watch out for yourselves.

529
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,480
somewhere.

530
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,520
We don't know when he will strike next.

531
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,020
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

532
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,540
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

533
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,560
Now you can say there's no such thing as Santa.

534
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,960
But as for me and grandpa we believe.

535
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,960
Sing it grandpa.

536
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,400
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

537
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,880
Oh, this thing is sent up.

538
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,000
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

539
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,600
Murphy sent one of his extra meito plushies, and this is
where he wants me to send the payment for the shipping.

540
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,740
Merry Christmas, Vito.

541
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh, Moe-fi.

542
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,620

Some of us are a bit new.

I will see what I can do.

554
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,260
I will see what I can do.

555
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,320
Yeah, if you rearrange the letters in Santa, you get Mito.

556
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,880
What's your cookie preference?

557
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,860
Um...

558
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,220
Hmm.

559
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,940
You need a second one for Oshikatsu?

560
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,320
Todd, ain't she extra lovely today?

561
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,560
You think it's a new lipstick?

562
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,740
What are you talking about?

563
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,780
Some people want a second.

564
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,500
So maybe I should try and do the other design then.

565
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,220
Is that what you're saying?

566
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,400
Okay, okay, mmm, mmm, mmm.

567
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:13,670
I made snicker cookies and gave them to...

568
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,030
gave them out Merry Xmas.

569
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,390
Merry Xmas!

570
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,810
Snicker cookie sounds amazing.

571
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,750
I love snicker doodles!

572
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:21,970
Ducky!

573
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,090
Sorry you had to see me a bunch.

574
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,130
Shut up, dummy.

575
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,030
Of course I like seeing you.

576
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,250
And talking with Oshi makes you happy.

577
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,210
I'm trying to make more animations.

578
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,610
No, and none of you are so busy.

579
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,690
Actually, I think my favorite type of cookie is an oatmeal
cookie.

580
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,210
Am I the only one?

581
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:43,690
Don't do the karaoke.

582
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,410
Oh, Driddle, Driddle, Driddle.

583
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,990
I'm me too out of clay.

584
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,530
And when it's dry, I'm ready.

585
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,270
With Driddle, I shall play.

586
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,510
Yeah.

587
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,510
With or without raisins.

588
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:58,870
Oh.

589
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,030
I'm fine with either.

590
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,490
Actually, I really love raisins.

591
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,510
I really like raisins, though.

592
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,620
I don't eat oatmeal cookies.

593
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,160
O'Meal's a solid choice.

594
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,660
I'm glad that my chat is so...

595
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,460
You guys are so great.

596
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,980
The eyeball or the bust.

597
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,820
Leave out cookies and milk and John Snake Metal Gear for
you.

598
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,280
Thank you!

599
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,000
Watch the frog look.

600
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,780
I'm doing membership.

601
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,700
Thank you.

602
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,300
Thank you.

603
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,440
Thank you.

604
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,160
Let's see.

605
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,340
What else can we sing?

606
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,590
No, what about this one?

607
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,440
Do I know this one?

608
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,700
I might have just picked it.

609
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,700
Oh, I'll do the Grinch after this one.

610
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,280
Oh, just kidding.

611
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,860
It switched over to the Grinch.

612
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,380
I thought I added it to my queue.

613
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,660
Okay, I'll do the other one.

614
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,360
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

615
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,280
You really are a heel.

616
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,640
You're as cuddly as a cactus.

617
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,180
charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch.

618
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:29,400
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel.

619
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,020
Ah, well, thank you!

620
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,340
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch.

621
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,360
Your heart's an empty hole.

622
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,420
Your brain is full of spiders and you've got Garlic in your
soul.

623
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,560
Mmm, Mr. Grinch.

624
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,360
I wouldn't touch you with what?

625
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,880
39 and a half foot pole.

626
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,620
You're a vile one.

627
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,760
Mr. Grinch.

628
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,040
You loved her.

629
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,040
My sin.

630
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,340
Your smile.

631
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,000
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile.

632
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,100
Mr. Grinch.

633
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:17,860
Wait.

634
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,440
I'll give you the choice between the two of you.

635
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,860
I'll take the seasick crocodile.

636
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,160
You're a silly one, Miss Minky.

637
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,460
You're a router, Mr. Grinch.

638
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,780
You're the king of sinful thoughts.

639
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,040
Your heart's a dead purple spot.

640
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,820
Mr. Grinch!

641
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:03,480
You're a three-decker sourcrown toadstool sandwich with
arsenic sauce!

642
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,920
You nauseate me.

643
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,920
Mr. Grinch.

644
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,940
With a nausea, super nice!

645
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,260
You're a crooked, jerky, jocky, and you drive a crooked
horse.

646
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,400
Mr. Grinch!

647
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:38,060
Your soul is an appalling dumb peep overflowing with the
most disgraceful assortment of rubbish imaginable, mingled

648
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,840
up in, I can't speak.

649
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,930
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch.

650
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:58,710
You're a nasty, wastey skunk.

651
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,410
Your heart is full of unwashed socks.

652
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:18,110
is full of gunk mr grinch the three words that best describe
you are as follows and i quote stink stank stank

You know, Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen Comet and

735
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:32,020
reindeer of all Rudolph the red nose reindeer had a very
shiny nose and if you ever saw it you would even say it goes

736
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:39,180
all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call in the
night Pinocchio.

737
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,960
They never left poor Rudolph.

738
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,980
Joining any reindeer games like Monopoly.

739
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:52,800
Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say, oh, oh, oh.

740
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,940
Rudolph with your nose so bright.

741
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,060
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

742
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,320
Then how the reindeer loved him.

743
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,040
As they shouted out with glee, yuppie.

744
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,740

01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,060
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call it names.

749
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,800
They never let poor Rudolph join another reindeer game.

750
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:47,240
Then when foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say, Oh, oh, oh,
Rudolph with your nose so bright, She'll guide my sleigh

751
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:59,760
