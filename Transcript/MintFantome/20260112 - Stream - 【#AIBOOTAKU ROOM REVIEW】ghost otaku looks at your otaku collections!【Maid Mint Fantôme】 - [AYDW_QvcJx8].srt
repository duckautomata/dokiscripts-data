1
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,650
What are you doing in my room?

2
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,390
What are you doing in here?

3
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,510
How'd you get in here?

4
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,540
You were invited.

5
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,680
The window is broken.

6
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,100
That's why it feels a little breezy.

7
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,240
What are you doing?

8
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,000
you doing in here?

9
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,380
Are you an otaku too?

10
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,380
I wrote that as a reference.

11
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,590
Looking for clues?

12
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,010
I'm innocent.

13
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,690
I'm innocent.

14
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,110
I swear.

15
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,050
Made burnt.

16
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,210
No, not correct.

17
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,270
Hi Minto.

18
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:40,890
Hello!

19
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,090
Moe moe boo.

20
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,710
Oh kairi nasaimasu.

21
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,990
Go shijin-sima or joe-sima.

22
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,410
Except...

23
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,790
This is not the maid cafe.

24
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,430
This is my room.

25
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,430
So it's kind of weird to welcome you home.

26
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,910
If it's my...

27
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,470
Room.

28
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,330
We brought snacks for the otaku party!

29
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,370
What's like an otaku snack?

30
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,950
Dr. Peppy.

31
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,290
Hi nerd.

32
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,990
You're cute.

33
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,650
Stop!

34
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,030
Stop it, right?

35
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:15,930
Pocky?

36
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,670
You guys?

37
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,770
Maybe.

38
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,330
Hello, Minto.

39
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,870
And I booze like you.

40
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,730
My tip for the day?

41
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,610
Keep your room clean.

42
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,670
And just in case Minky visits your room.

43
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,530
I will.

44
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,710
Actually, I felt like I gave a lot of time.

45
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,490
I was like...

46
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,470
I was like, oh, I was gonna do...

47
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:49,690
this stream on Friday but then I was like oh if I do a
Sunday that gives some people the weekend to clean as well

48
00:06:49,690 --> 00:07:05,770
did you clean I got a whole bowl of strawberry jelly does
that work yes a

49
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:19,450
little no sort of cleaning clean

50
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,880
Silly side note.

51
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,460
I tried searching for the Borgur emoji for that last super
chat.

52
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,420
It did not work.

53
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,120
They need to give it the times.

54
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,200
It should be Borgur.

55
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,200
You should be able to search Borgur and Borgur.

56
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
Joke's on you, I'm not an otaku.

57
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,520
I like normal person things like the sports ball and taxes.

58
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,600
Who likes taxes?

59
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,460
Even normal people like taxes?

60
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:03,780
like taxes only nerds are gonna like taxes probably you know

61
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:24,210
numbers numbers numbers oh five hmm what's another number uh
five two uh four um times

62
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
I shouldn't have asked you guys.

63
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,640
You guys have bad opinions.

64
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,380
I live in Texas.

65
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,700
Thank you.

66
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,260
Thank you for telling us that.

67
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,580
If I see any Godzilla or Kamen Rider merch in any Ibu's
rooms, they will become my favorite.

68
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,320
I searched through a little bit.

69
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,740
I don't know if I saw any Kamen Rider or Godzilla.

70
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
Is it too late to send in a pick?

71
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,680
No, I'm just gonna be going through the rooms.

72
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:13,120
but yeah uh heads up today might be a little bit of a
shorter stream I apologize I'm feeling funky not funky fresh

73
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,940
funky bad funky negative

74
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:28,060
funky negative so I'm you know but we'll do this again in
the future so now we'll give you maybe I've even thought I

75
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,460
saw so many people being like I didn't have time to clean.

76
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,520
I was like, do I even do I just wait to do it?

77
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,800
But that's okay.

78
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,740
You streamed a lot yesterday.

79
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,340
I don't even think that's it.

80
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,620
I think it's just, I don't know.

81
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

82
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,820
Cleaned, I put the whole shelf together along with a fresh
coat of paint.

83
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,980
Definitely didn't miss a spot on the shelf.

84
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:54,840
See?

85
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,120
Good job!

86
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,240
Unless you missed a spot and then I'm going to point it and
I will laugh at you.

87
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,460
Put the glasses back on.

88
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,460
It's minting time.

89
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,640
I put my merch in the freezer to keep it cool.

90
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,720
That was it.

91
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,240
That's actually, oh my gosh, what if you have like a little
diorama in your freezer?

92
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,820
All I put in my freezer is Nelson.

93
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,380
So I could put like, I could make it look like Antarctica in
there.

94
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,160
And then every time opens it, which nobody comes over.

95
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,740
They could see every time I feel like opening it.

96
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,600
Not even ice cream?

97
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,280
No?

98
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,180
Well, I have to, I would only be able to do that if somebody
were to like you know, offer me ice cream.

99
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,880
You know what I mean?

100
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Like if it were an offer, for me to take.

101
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,270
No eyes?

102
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,050
I only drink hot water.

103
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,310
I only drink...

104
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,850
I...

105
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,630
I channel my inner Chinese grandma and I only drink hot
water.

106
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,670
Pretty much.

107
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,150
And tea.

108
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,790
Which is, like, hot water.

109
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,370
Hot water on its own?

110
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,750
With both, both tea and hot water on its own.

112
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,890
It's good, I recommend it.

113
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,190
Hot leaf juice.

114
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,030
Yeah.

115
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,390
Oh my gosh.

116
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,190
Hey, have a thank you for the ice cream.

117
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,230
Ban-kay, thank you so much for the fun.

118
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,730
Get it!

119
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,710
Thank you, thank you.

120
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,770
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,720
And now I want ice cream.

122
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,870
Ice cream.

123
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,830
And you know, I said I was having a bit of a funky day.

124
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,190
And I was like, I'm gonna get some of my favorite food.

125
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,250
But the place that I wanted to get food from was closed
today.

126
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,090
And so I said, okay, well, I'll try another place that has
something similar.

127
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,530
And it was not good.

128
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,550
And you know, when you want your favorite food, and you get
like a cheap imitation, it's so...

129
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,090
It just hurts.

130
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,210
I'll go buy a pint.

131
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,630
How are all?

132
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,630
Thank you!

133
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,450
Idea for post-stream emotional recovery get yummy ice cream!

134
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah!

135
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,630
Thanks to our goal!

136
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,370
Sorry I posted an old pic for the review since I haven't
really updated my collection lately, but I promise I did my

137
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,190
New Year's cleaning.

138
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,490
Okay, Gappa, you better pinky promise.

139
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,670
You better...

140
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,930
You better promise me that you're actually clean!

141
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,830
You wouldn't be lying to me now, would you?

142
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,270
You wouldn't lie to this ghost.

143
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:40,930
Would you?

144
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,830
You wouldn't lie to this ghost.

145
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,380
You lying to this ghost?

146
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,480
You wouldn't download a ghost.

147
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,220
Would you...

148
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,120
That...

149
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,780
What kind of virus would a ghost be like?

150
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Hmm...

151
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,180
What's that like one virus that is like a...

152
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,820
What's it called?

153
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,380
Like a goose that is on your desktop and he sometimes steals
your mouse and things like that.

154
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,760
That's how I feel a ghost might be.

155
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,160
It's kind of moving your icons around a little bit
sometimes.

156
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:56,040
and then like sometimes you have a like a window open and it
minimizes it my room looks stunning no picks just trust

157
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:14,800
we're trusting we're trusting I would and have and he closed
on the floor and I'm I'm gonna freak out.

158
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,080
You shouldn't.

159
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,260
Bonzi, but is that what it was called?

160
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,260
Yeah.

161
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Would download the pending.

162
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,460
Are you available for download?

163
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:35,100
I've been going into the Denzetsu Discord and slowly, like,
very minimally changing people's names.

164
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,340
To see if anybody...

165
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,160
I go and I change, like, one person's name a day.

166
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,580
Just a little bit.

167
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,700
To see if anybody will notice.

168
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,060
I've only done a handful of people.

169
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,850
And I do it when they're like offline.

170
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,870
Maybe they'll notice.

171
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,210
It'll be like a space in between their name.

172
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,590
Very minimal.

173
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,430
Or like, I'll change, like, a letter or something.

174
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,090
That's what I've been doing.

175
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,640
When they'll log on and be Blade Fox, baby.

176
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,940
I could change that to you right now.

177
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,340
Five months, blind fish.

178
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,040
Thank you.

179
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,760
Thank you, thank you.

180
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Why are you like this?

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,670
Our collections.

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,130
I don't really have like a, how to say, a method for this.

201
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,110
I'm just, we're just kind of winging it a little bit.

202
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,890
We're just kind of, we're just kind of going for it a little
bit.

All those headpats are for you.

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,890
Stop being sick right now!

210
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,450

211
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,230
Wait!

212
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,190

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,670
Don't be cold.

217
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,490
It's winter.

218
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,630
What are you doing?

219
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,150

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,510
Oh, there we go.

228
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,750
That doesn't look like a room.

229
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,930
Obviously, they are a food otaku.

230
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,970
They are a food otaku, clearly.

231
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,790

Yeah.

239
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,650
Let's see what else we got in here.

The three different ones, but it's the same pose?

250
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,130
Didn't you used to have a Nyaruko profile picture, or am I
crazy?

251
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,390
I'll go back and forth.

252
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,330

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,720
This one's cute too though.

257
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,540
Are these Dojin?

258
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,740
Wait a second.

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,180

260
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,900

261
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,720
Oh, it does say four Dojinchi.

262
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,740
I need to learn to read.

263
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,640
Ah!

264
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,800

269
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,100

270
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,740
VINALS?

271
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,300
Are these all VINALS?

272
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,860
Oh my god.

273
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:07,120

276
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,440
It couldn't have been.

277
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,340
There's more than one of you that has this comforter.

278
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,200
I know it.

279
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,540
A teacup looking ass bed over here.

280
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
It's comfy, though.

281
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,100
It's the same one.

282
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
It is, isn't it?

283
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,300
I'm certain somebody said she liked it last time.

284
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,580
Yeah, I love it.

285
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,440
That's why I remember it.

286
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,540
Someone said that these are laser discs.

287
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,980
Wait, look, Indiana Jones is in Japanese!

288
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,560

In Japanese!

293
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,480
I bet there's decorative shampoo somewhere.

294
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,740
Laser Disc was more popular in Japan.

295
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,020
Oh, so cool!

296
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,160
Wow, wait.

Wait, this is such an awesome collection.

300
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,180
This is my special interest!

301
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,800
I love collecting anime dishware.

302
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,060
So I have lots of plates and bowls and lots and lots of
cups.

303
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,240
Let's see what...

304
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,300

305
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,680
This is my special interest.

306
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,320
I like the way you've displayed them.

307
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,280
I actually use mine, but...

308
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,740
Me.

309
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,800
I actually use mine.

310
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,860
But I like the way you've displayed them.

311
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,140
Because some of them, I'm kind of lazy if I put it in the
dishwasher.

312
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,140
Some of them have faded away.

313
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,200
I have, like, a Keys in an Eye one, and she's, like, a

Everything looks so nice!

374
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,270
This is, I feel like, a really great argument for framing
your posters and stuff, you guys.

375
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,090
When you frame, like, putting your posters up is fine,
whatever, you know, but if you frame them, it really, like,

376
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:12,310
adds a level of, like, I don't know, like, hominess and,
and, uh, like, it just, it looks, I don't want to say,

377
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,010
professional is not the right word.

378
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,770
But it, class, yeah, it's very classy.

379
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:27,390
And you don't have to get expensive frames or anything like
even just like a very simple one like this there you can

380
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:37,030
find them I have I get a bunch for like five dollars you
know and Yeah it's it really elevates your your your

381
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:46,330
aesthetic your room and everything is it really really is
ours yeah yeah so I recommend a hundred percent

382
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,150

383
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,050

These are so cute!

393
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,390
Those Avatar Legos are so rare.

394
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,090
Really?

395
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,630
I've had a social media account for years, so I had to make
a Blue Sky account.

396
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,290
If you don't get to it, no worries.

397
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,770
Can't wait to submit for the next one.

00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,130
Oh, you didn't have to make an account just for this,
though.

402
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,590
Also, first punch, happy birthday!

403
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,910
Yeah, the mystery machine and the DeLorean.

404
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,570
I'm guessing that's...

405
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,490
That looks like...

406
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,050
That looks like Back to the Future.

407
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,030
And the Ghostbusters...

408
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,770
To keep them away from me, though, obviously.

409
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,590
This is so cute!

410
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,790
I like whatever this shelving is.

411
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:11,510
I prefer the ones with like the like ink enclosed, you know,
and like glass or something.

412
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,780
I prefer mine to be glass all around so that I can but
actually I really like this.

413
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,030
Oh.

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,730
Oh my god.

536
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,730
The Pokemon.

537
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,430
Wait, this is so nice.

538
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,550
The Pokemon bedsheets.

539
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:38,790
Dog.

540
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,570
Look at that dog.

541
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,510
I feel like this is the perfect...

542
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:49,690
I'd like you to have like a shelf to kind of like separate
your desk and everything.

543
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,710
Like this is a...

544
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,090
This is really nice.

545
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,990
Isn't it a nice place?

546
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,790
Yeah, Sonic Colony here.

547
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,930
Big Holo Fan.

548
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,610
Cute.

549
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,590
How did you get this picture?

550
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,570
Is that your kitchen?

551
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,350
Looks like a kitchen.

552
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,550
Hmm...

553
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,400
We have the Garupan up there.

554
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,000
It's like the only thing besides Pokemon that's like a...

555
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,020
And Miku here.

556
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,740
That's like the only thing that's not VTuber related.

557
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,480
Don't look at their kitchen.

558
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,560
Why not?

559
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,940
If I come over, I want to know where the food is at.

560
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,620
You can see this security camera.

561
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,140
Oh, you can.

562
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,380
Ah, you can.

563
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,140
You can, you can, you can right there.

564
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,340
I thought it was like you just stand really far in the
corner.

565
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Very nice.

566
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,420
Very nice, Benjamin.

567
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:58,980
Benjamin.

568
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,400
Can I pet the dog?

569
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,500
That's not for me to say yes or no to.

570
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
That's not for me.

571
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,300
Oh my gosh, wait.

572
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,900
Skeletons!

573
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,800
I saw your...

574
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:27,740
put this one earlier one second sorry i keep having to like
adjust i saw this and i was so excited because look at the

575
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:40,080
lupan of like the the zaku shelf and then and now the lupan
is so cool

576
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,180
Yeah, char-

577
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,120
You're maxing.

578
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,840
Thanks for the donut!

579
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,140
Zaku-Kiri.

580
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,880
Yeah, yeah, I've seen this before.

581
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,880
Quite a bit.

582
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,760
I like how this is like...

583
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,880
It's like yaoi shelves.

584
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,300
Both are yaoi shelves.

585
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,160
I didn't know.

586
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,160
Is this their pairing?

587
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:29,600
this is so funny because it looks like the the bad guy for
like so in detective conan they um they um uh when before

588
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:39,860
you know who like the the the criminal is they uh they are
like this shadow person and so it looks like this shadow

589
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:50,820
person from Conan but yeah all you see are their eyes and
their mouth that's it and like it's become kind of a meme

590
00:44:50,820 --> 00:45:02,880
because it's like a very simple design obviously but it's so
iconic so it's very very iconic like you'll see him you'll

591
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:13,000
see him in like because he's drawn a very specific way so
They did an anime about the design.

592
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:13,660
Oh, really?

593
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,340
I don't think I saw it.

594
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,840
I love this, though.

595
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,300
The...

596
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,380
What is that called?

597
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,540
Like, the needlework.

598
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,840
But...

599
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,720
That's so stinking cute.

600
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,500
That's a Lupon shelf.

601
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,240
I'm obsessed.

602
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,960
That is my pairing, yes.

603
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,740
Thank you for checking out Blue Sky 2.

604
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,080
And yeah, that Shadow Guy is from Castle...

605
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,380
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

606
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,800
Also animated by TMS.

607
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,480
I can never say the name of a castle of...

608
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,640
Cagliostro.

609
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,800
Embroidery.

610
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,300
Thank you.

611
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,820
Cross stitch?

612
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,680
Is it cross stitch?

613
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,100
Looks more like embroidery.

614
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:53,720
I don't know.

615
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,720
I'm not a...

616
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,400
I'm not a...

617
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,800
What's the word?

618
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,960
An expert.

619
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,220
My brain is super foggy today.

620
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,180
I can't think of anything.

621
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,320
I'm so sorry, you guys.

622
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,540
Close enough.

623
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,680
Close enough.

624
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,840

Yummy film.

630
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,680
You could just suck on it if you want.

631
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,460
I wonder what kind of taste it is, though.

632
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,840
Sticky film.

633
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
It's a sticky film.

634
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,380
Yeah, you gotta give them a little bath.

635
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,420
Give them a bath.

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,860
Oh, this is so cute!

637
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,860
You always go to your Pokemon things.

638
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,640
This is so cute.

639
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,680
Pokemon eat a bag.

640
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,540
Cute, cute, cute.

641
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,200
I love the theming.

642
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,460
Everything is so good.

643
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,580
Nice.

644
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,680
Thank you, Skeletal.

645
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,700
What the hell?

646
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,010
Do you guys know Utsi?

647
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,870
The Frozen Caveman?

648
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,050
What they found?

649
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,010
That's what this reminds me of.

650
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,430
A mitzvah.

651
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,230
The ice man.

652
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,410
I can hear I don't want a lot for Christmas plague already.

653
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,790
It's time!

654
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,910
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

655
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:15,030
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG No, I think
defrosting would be...

656
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,530
What would defrost?

657
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,090
What would be my song to defrost?

658
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:21,630
Ah...

659
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,310
I mean, I guess it could be welcome to Mint Cafe.

660
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,590
Or Mint Cafe, sorry.

661
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,910
Ice Minky, what are you doing?

662
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:28,890
Get out of there!

663
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,270
I'm cozy, I'm cozy.

664
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,630
Santa baby!

665
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,050
Hey, Minta, why the cold shoulder?

666
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,610
Looking cool, Minto.

667
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,150
This is not what I said when I said I wanted ice cream!

668
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,250
This is not what I meant!

669
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,010
Why did you freeze me?

670
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:55,050
Why?

671
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,950
Why?

672
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,010
Why?

673
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,270
Why did you freeze me?

674
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,190
Why did you freeze me?

675
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,170
Why?

676
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,750
Why am I frozen?

677
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,550

678
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:40,340

photo printers from left to right a thermal sticker printer
an Instax SP2 for minis then Instax SP3 for squares a selfie

over each one i love the stickers wait don't thermal

681
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,420

receipt wouldn't it rub off eventually which is kind of so

682
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,040
sad but it looks so good

683
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,980
It's unique.

684
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:25,660
Yeah!

685
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,080
Thermals do fade after a while.

686
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,680
Surprisingly, it works fine.

687
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,320
Oh, really?

688
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,380
Just don't rub the stickers.

689
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,960
Eat it before it does.

690
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,080
So true?

691
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,640

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,180
And this one, too.

00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,300
This, this, this, I, this is from the, this is from Holman.

698
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:03,960

I wanna, I wanna, oh my gosh, having a, wait, having like
one of these digital photo frames, though, for like Oshi

703
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,040
pictures is kind of genius.

704
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,520
Like it just cycles through like you know pictures of your
Oshi.

705
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,160
Wait that's kind of genius.

706

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,320
Wait that's so smart.

711
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,920
It doesn't have to be for normie things like babies and
pets.

712
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:01,640
It can also be for it can also be for your oshi or whatever

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,440
geiger counter

715
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,280
It reads 1.44 micro...

716
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,100
How do you say that?

717
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:33,780
Seavorts?

718
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,180
The card is overlaid on top of the Geiger counter to show
when it's dangerous.

719
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,220
It could be high enough to warrant caution, but the
radiation from the lens is blocked by skin.

720
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,060
And when attached to a camera is blocked by the camera body.

721
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,200
What?

722
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,350
Wait, which reading would it be?

723
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,010
Oh wait, it's this one.

724
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,410
Oh, it's this one, okay.

725
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,090
Only mildly radioactive.

726
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,450
Mildly radioactive.

727
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,810
Radioactive.

728
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,630
Radioactive.

729
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,390
Not good, not bad.

730
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,090
That's crazy, I never knew it was like that.

731
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,050
Oh my gosh, Seattle!

732
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:42,910
Washington!

733
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,350
That's Alan Wake!

734
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,490
Oh my god.

735
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:54,070
Thank you so much, Seymour, for the really cool collection.

736
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,210
Let's see what else we got in here.

737
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:03,810
There was something I wanted to look at more, because I
remember seeing it, and I was like, this is so cool.

738
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:04,850
And I want to...

739
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,170
Oh, here!

740
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,190
I found it.

741
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:07,690

Kappa Rider Club.

748
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,560
It's so, it looks so good.

749
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,700
It looks so, so good.

750
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,280
That's me, down here.

751
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,420
This is so good!

752
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't know so much about wrestling, so...

753
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,840
But look, look, look!

754
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,640

755
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,720
Mint in the hurt syndicate.

756
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,080
She hurts us.

757
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:31,470
Resultober.

758
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,030

759
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,750
Wait!

760
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,450
You posted this picture!

761
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,510
I saw this recently!

762
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,050
The boom!

763
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,030
I saw this recently on on on on on on Twitter.

764
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,990
Oh, the photos are so cute.

765
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,430
Like the Oshikatsu is so good.

766
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:03,390
The Maki Ito, yeah, is the cutest idol wrestler in the
world.

767
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,170
This is so good.

768
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,130
This is so stinking good.

769
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,190
Oh my god.

770
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,210
Wait, I didn't see this picture.

771
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,280
This is...

772
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,740
Wow.

773
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,940
Oh my god.

774
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,940
This is too good.

775
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,660
What is this?

776
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,740
This is so good.

777
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,840
How it wake!

778
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,020
Oh my god!

779
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,320
The cardboard cutouts.

780
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,120
I feel like every...

781
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,700
benefits from a cardboard cutout.

782
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,500
You know what I'll do, you guys?

783
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,820
I'm going to get artwork commissioned.

784
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,920
And I'm going to give it to you guys so you can make your
own cardboard cutout if you'd like.

785
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,440
I'll get you the art.

786
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,960
And so it can be a cardboard cutout that you can make and
put in your room.

787
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,000
I feel like a room is really complete with a cardboard
cutout.

788
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,760
Hell yeah!

789
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,960
I mean obviously I can't do the cardboard cutout for you,
but all you have to do is order it and get it.

790
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,860
Bay is still upside down.

791
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,700
Wait where?

792
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,840
She's right so- oh there she is upside down!

793
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,880
Oh my god!

794
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,300
This is- I know this skeleton!

795
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,400
This is so funny!

796
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,900
Everything is- everything is too good!

797
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,260
It's so funny.

798
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,840
Also, Matara signed this.

799
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,440
See her signature is right here on John Cena Momo.

800
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,780
I want to know, though, Hamburger Kun, if you do these
photoshopped.

801
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,640
Or if you get somebody else to.

802
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,840
Because, like...

803
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,600
Like, this is so funny.

804
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,580
It's so good.

805
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:40,440
And you have so much variety of, like, VTubers.

806
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,060
Other stuff, too.

807
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,280
Like, I see, like, other anime and stuff, too.

808
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,860
But, like, you seem just so supportive of so many people.

809
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,400
That's really awesome.

810
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,140
Thank you so much.

811
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,200
Oh, I photoshopped them myself!

812
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,660
Oh, my God!

813
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,140
Yeah, the movement poster is so cute.

814
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,680
I'm such a fan.

815
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,860
I think I'm a fan of you.

816
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:11,600
Ah!

817
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,510
You made it into a acrylic stand!

818
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,190
It just gets better and better.

819
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,750
Aww, the doobie stuff!

820
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:40,250
Doobie!

821
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,030
Doobie, doobie!

822
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,330
Oh, Ashton!

823
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,450
Oh wow!

824
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,090
Wow, thank you, Hamburger, for sharing.

825
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,910
I love seeing your photos when you post them, so thank you
very much.

826
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,170
This is so...

827
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,110
So funny.

828
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,770
Wandering Taco!

829
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,470

851
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,010

Let's see.

856
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:33,910
Rokai says, behold my messy dusty Otaku room.

857
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,650
Wait.

858
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:42,790
Expand.

859
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,330
There we go.

860
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,370
Alright, let's see what we've got in here.

861
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,890
First of all.

862
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,570
Why?

863
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,690
Your monitor is blocking this whole detour find here.

864
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,910
I see some Miku, see Kiwawa's...

865
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:04,930
Wait, who is that?

866
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:05,730
I can't tell.

867
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,570
Is that... that's not...

868
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,370
Oh my gosh, I have this!

869
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,730
This Yuki plushie too!

01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,030
I see Kurisutina.

871
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,690
I have so many questions.

872
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,250
Okay, wait.

873
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,210
I have some questions.

874
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:30,950
So...

875
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,210
Like...

876
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,190
Oh wait, is this the Lego Game Boy?

877
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,190
It's so nice.

878
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:38,830
What are these?

879
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,830
Why are there like little chairs on your desk?

880
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,790
Who are they for?

881
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:46,650
The bugs?

882
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,150
Like...

883
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,010
Hot dog gotcha.

884
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,700
Chairs for Barry.

885
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,540
Yeah, for the bugs.

886
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,140
It looks like you're, you have like a little bit of a, like,
you know, like a tiny model set.

887
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,420
Like those, those are like garbage cans, like garbage
separators.

888
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,400
But...

889
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:25,980
This is...

890
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,280
Yeah.

891
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:38,130
Um...

892
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:38,990
Who is it?

893
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,750
Whose body is in here?

894
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:46,770
Look, just Mikasha on the table.

895
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,110

I see Yaya Han.

912
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,610

920
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,350
I'm such an idiot.

921
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:22,390
As soon as I came out of my lips, I was like, Oh, duh,
because...

922
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:26,590
Sorry.

923
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,990
At first I was like, why?

924
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:29,370
Why?

925
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,250

1074
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:24,740
I love him.

1075
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,620
My stupid son.

1076
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,360
Yeah, it's very like kimo kawaii.

1077
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,500
Like just like ugly, cute.

1078
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,280
Some people don't think they're cute at all though.

1079
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,040
They're...

1080
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,620
Wow!

1081
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,620
Oh my gosh, the more I see.

1082
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,570
So cool!

1083
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:05,190
I am such a huge sucker for like props like these from video
games.

1084
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,190
I think they look so cool.

1085
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,590
I feel like they really enhance a collection.

1086
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:16,210
Like, like they just like kind of like life size props of
stuff.

1087
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:18,070
Just look so awesome.

1088
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:22,970
Yeah I see if I see him.

1089
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:24,810
Snack.

1090
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:28,790
Feet.

1091
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:30,070
Wait, where do you see feet?

1092
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:32,330
I don't see any.

1093
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,850
I choose Sesame Street.

1094
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,410
The Muppets are Neo Pets.

1095
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,490
Don't spend your money like I do I booze.

1096
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:46,170
Also, I had to reply to that post to get the last shelf.

1097
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,270
Oh, there's one more.

1098
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,950
Chinese food and Minto stream.

1099
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:51,690
Today is a good day.

1100
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,330
Chinese food sounds so good!

1101
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,130
Wait, I kind of want Chinese food.

1102
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,010
Hmm.

1103
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,290
Wait, hold on, let me...

1104
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,370
You had the reply, you said.

1105
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,210
Okay, can't control.

1106
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,170
I'm gonna have to clown on you for a little bit.

1107
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:19,890
What the hell?

1108
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,590
What is...

1109
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,330
What the hell is going on here?

1110
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:30,570
Are those supposed to be blackout curtains?

1111
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,570
Please invest in a steamer.

1112
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,880
What is happening?

1113
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,440
No, it's awesome.

1114
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,920
No, it's...

1115
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,060
Okay, wait, I know Doom Guy.

1116
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,960
Oh, wow, look at the persona mask, too.

1117
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,640
It's so cool.

1118
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:09,320
But this one, oh gosh, what's the name of the, what's the
game's name?

1119
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,860
I had a, it blocks out light.

1120
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:15,820
Home.

1121
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,080
Dead space.

1122
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,240
Yes, thank you.

1123
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1124
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,480
Yes, and my brain kept wanting to say Bioshock, and I was
like, no, that's not it.

1125
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,220
That's not it.

1126
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,360
Invest in a steamer?

1127
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,220
No, I prefer investing in a streamer.

1128
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:39,640
Honestly, though, steamers are so good, you guys.

1129
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:44,600
They're great for getting out wrinkles very easily, like
this.

1130
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:50,940
And you don't have to pull out a whole ironing board and
things like that.

1131
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,460
Get a steamer.

1132
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:00,380
That's like my, that's my real world advice for you.

1133
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,420
Investing in this steamer.

1134
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,480
True and real.

1135
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,600
Thank you, Campin' Jero!

1136
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,100
Thank you for sharing.

1137
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,280
Oh my gosh, your profile picture is so cute.

1138
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,560
Wait, before we go to...

1139
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,460
Back to Twitter.

1140
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,080
Chocolate.

1141
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,020
Ironing board?

1142
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,120
Why are you saying it like that, huh, Spank?

1143
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,780
Why are you saying it like that, huh?

1144
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,540
Look at the carby's!

1145
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,580
So much carbo!

1146
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,740
Wow, this is so cute!

1147
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,400
Carbo!

1148
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,540
A pack of steamer with me when I travel.

1149
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:58,280
It's such a handy thing.

1150
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:58,700
I know!

1151
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,720
I'm telling you guys.

1152
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,900
It will enhance your life or afterlife.

1153
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,400
Look!

1154
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,660
And...

1155
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,340
Oh, this is so cute!

1156
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:12,880
Wow!

1157
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:14,460
Wow!

1158
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,020
Kirby's Dream, man.

1159
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,060
We played that.

1160
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,520
There's so much Kirby!

1161
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,160
This is so cute.

1162
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,100
Play-oh!

1163
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,060
I want to play the...

1164
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,540
I've heard good things about...

1165
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:28,940
What is it?

1166
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,580
Air Rider or whatever?

1167
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,560
I want to play it.

1168
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,320
And look at the cartridges and everything.

1169
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,280
Everything's all displayed.

1170
01:25:38,620 --> 01:26:04,180
Wow Wow Wow Wow So cute Play-O Wow Wow Wow you have like
everything So cute Is this like every game?

1171
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,660
And the 3DS even

1172
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:14,090
Viewer content with Air Riders?

1173
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,990
Wait, is it like multiplayer?

1174
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:22,750
If not, it's darn close.

1175
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,170
Almost all of them.

1176
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:24,670
Wow!

1177
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:28,250
Wow.

1178
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:32,710
It looks like every game.

1179
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,830
That's crazy.

1180
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:36,810
So fun.

1181
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,870
Wait, in Air Riders, can I play as Meta Knight?

1182
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,070
It's better with multiplayer.

1183
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:48,030
Can I play as him?

1184
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,910
I can!

1185
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,610
Oh my god, there he is.

1186
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:57,970
He's literally right there.

1187
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:59,530
Wait, what's his name again?

1188
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,950
Hold on, don't tell me.

1189
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:08,770
Don't tell me.

1190
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:10,330
Don't tell me.

1191
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:11,030
Don't tell me.

1192
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,630
Don't tell me.

1193
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,070
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me,
don't tell me.

1194
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,890
Oh, whoa,

1195
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:22,320
whoa, whoa.

1196
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,460
Waddle do?

1197
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,990
Waddle do.

1198
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:32,870
Close.

1199
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,250
Waddle D!

1200
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,630
Waddle D's.

1201
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:53,150
I kind of like Waddle do better.

1202
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:58,610
Thank you for sharing your Corbel collection.

1203
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:02,610
Whoa!

1204
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:04,090
Oh my gosh, K-Bard.

1205
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,050
More transformers.

1206
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,950
It's kind of insane how many...

1207
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:09,130
Whoops.

1208
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:15,230
How many people, like, collect transformers.

1209
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,170
And, like, when you collect transformers, you...

1210
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:21,390
Like, most people are like, I collect transformers.

1211
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:23,830
You know, like, it's not like a...

1212
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:28,050
It's not a small endeavor.

1213
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:31,090
It's always, like, it's always like the biggest...

1214
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:45,040
collections ever my question for the whips is that wasps I
boost how often do you dust your room I have a pile of that

1215
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:59,060
sits in dust in the corner I'm too lazy to organize oh well
for me I dust like I try to dust like once a week but it's

1216
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:03,660
also like what's the word like

1217
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:16,820
My place is abandoned, so it doesn't...

1218
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,860
I plead the fifth.

1219
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,080
You guys should always dust, though.

1220
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,540
Holy cow!

1221
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,900
Who's Roshi?

1222
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,640
Oh my god!

1223
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,600
Do

1224
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,440
you like shockwaves?

1225
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,880
That's crazy!

1226
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,920
Oh my gosh, yeah, that's fun boy.

1227
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:55,900
Oh!

1228
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,960
Oh my god, oh my god!

1229
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,460
Okay, Barn, if you're here, how long did this...

1230
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,980
How long did this take for this collection?

1231
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,980
This is insanity.

1232
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,060
This is so much.

1233
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,360
Holy cow.

1234
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,750
Dustin, your home is mainly made of your own dead skin.

1235
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:31,870
So in a way, the dust will protect your items, much like
your skin protects you.

1236
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,570
What about the fur then?

1237
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:36,310
Oh, there you are.

1238
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:38,410
It started in 2001.

1239
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,010
It sounds like a saga.

1240
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:43,150
It all began.

1241
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:45,370
In 2001.

1242
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,650
Oh my god.

1243
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,340
Glad you did mine first.

1244
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,720
This collection rules.

1245
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:03,280
Oh my god.

1246
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,340
This is so good.

1247
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,020
I'm so honored to be in the middle of all of this, honestly.

1248
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,280
I don't feel like we deserve to be here.

1249
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:19,540
I feel like...

1250
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,520
This collection is insane!

1251
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:25,860
Tiny

1252
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:34,150
the miniatures, oh my god.

1253
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:37,470
Wow.

1254
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:46,910
Okay, Martin, I really hope you don't live in a place that
is prone to earthquakes.

1255
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:47,810
Kitty!

1256
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:54,490
Oh my god, does your cat try to get into the stuff?

1257
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,230
Kitty!

1258
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:59,310
This is a temple.

1259
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,010
This is truly a museum.

1260
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,750
This is so awesome.

1261
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:09,290
This is so awesome.

1262
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,190
Definitive Otaku.

1263
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:19,190
This is so awesome.

1264
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:20,770
Thank

1265
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,440
you for sharing.

1266
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,200
Thank you for sharing.

1267
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:45,400
the wallpaper is courtesy of the 40th anniversary music
video studio trigger and bump of chicken did two years ago

1268
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:55,120
and no kit is very well behaved i learned something today i
don't know if you guys saw that tweet as well that came if

1269
01:32:55,120 --> 01:33:03,800
it came up in your timeline but it was like talking about
japanese band names and it was they were talking about bump

1270
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:10,780
of chicken which Apparently, the Japanese for Bump of
Chicken is like...

1271
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,420
What was it?

1272
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,080
The Bump of Chicken one.

1273
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:15,620
Yeah, yeah!

1274
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,350
It was like...

1275
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,480
Um...

1276
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,340
It was like something about like...

1277
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,440
Going against... Like, yeah, Revenge of the Coward!

1278
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,180
I see a little space left at the bottom slagging.

1279
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,980
Of mad respect for this cat.

1280
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,800
They've never knocked over these.

1281
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,100
Yeah.

1282
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:42,240
But apparently it's supposed to be like revenge of the
coward.

1283
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:46,640
Because like when you bump like a chicken is like another.

1284
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,640
It's like a synonym for a coward.

1285
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,760
And then chickens when they fight they kind of like bump
chests and stuff.

1286
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,360
So it's supposed to be like.

1287
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,140
Like a chicken's fighting or something.

1288
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,780
It's very bizarre.

1289
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,760
And then there was like a whole like thread of.

1290
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:10,940
explanations for I've always wondered why they were called
Bump of Chicken.

1291
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,060
I never knew.

1292
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,680
and they were like there was other people explaining like
other Japanese band names.

1293
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,820
Like one okay rock is supposed to be one one a claw.

1294
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:37,160
It's supposed to I guess in Japanese one okuroku one okay
One o'clock.

1295
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,180
One o'clock.

1296
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,240
One o'clock.

1297
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,020
One o'clock.

1298
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,580
One o'clock.

1299
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:52,140
But one o'clock like it, I never questioned it because I was
like, oh you're a band, it's whatever.

1300
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,620
One o'clock.

1301
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,540
It's so good.

1302
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:02,120
Yeah.

1303
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,020
It's so funny.

1304
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,920
It's so funny.

1305
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:13,560
But...

1306
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:16,840
There was another one.

1307
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,670
There was another one that I read about.

1308
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,040
And I was like, what?

1309
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,020
Oh, wow, I never...

1310
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,780
Oh, the Gazette.

1311
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,140
They were... Oh, what was it?

1312
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,180
They were not like a gazette, like a newspaper.

1313
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,140
It was something else.

1314
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:35,180
Ah!

1315
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,420
Ah!

1316
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:39,660
Cassette!

1317
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,400
Right, right, right!

1318
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,220
Cassette!

1319
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,080
It's a play-on cassette!

1320
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,040
Like a cassette tape.

1321
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,280
Oh, it's so funny.

1322
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:02,250
It's so funny how the...

1323
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,880
The bands are.

1324
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:07,840
Page!

1325
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,400
This guy is so cute!

1326
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,680

01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,120
My glasses.

1328
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:25,460
Wait!

1329
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,740
You got one of the buzzwords!

1330
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:30,640

1331
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:34,980
Gosh!

1332
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:40,080
I wish I had more time to decorate them more.

1333

These are so cute.

1340
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,800
Wait, this is like supposed to be a name tag, right?

1341
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,520
You should write your name on that.

1342
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:34,410
Hello?

1343
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,130
Shoebill!

1344
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:38,550
So cute!

1345
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:39,750
So cute!

1346
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:41,350
Wood.

1347
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,750
Hello, Pyram.

1348
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:46,510
Hello?

1349
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:48,090
Pyra.

1350
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:54,210
That's me.

1351
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:57,890
That's me.

1352
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,120
I love how...

1353
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,380
Paige, what is going on here?

1354
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:09,660
You have all these Goku's.

1355
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,780
And then Pyra.

1356
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,040
They're just...

1357
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,180
They're just out and about.

1358
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,680
This is a really... What is this?

1359
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,080
Like one...

1360
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,840
One-fourth scale?

1361
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,180
Right!

1362
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,560
Probably.

1363
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:30,200
Maybe.

1364
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:34,840
He's big.

1365
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:37,800
He's big.

1366
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,180
The five Goku's are teaming up to take down Pyra.

1367
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,980
No, I think it's definitely bigger than one-sixth.

1368
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,960
I think it's one-fourth.

1369
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,560
That's one-fourth.

1370
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,340
She's small.

1371
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:03,020
But if she stands up, it's like one-fourth, but on her
knees.

1372
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,000
It's one-fourth.

1373
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,200
I told you.

1374
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,480
I told you.

1375
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,340
I know my figures.

1376
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:11,600
And I know my figure sizes.

1377
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,540
I told you all.

1378
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,120
You say one-sixth.

1379
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,580
No, I argue you.

1380
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:17,880
I told you.

1381
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,240
Don't question my authority.

1382
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,100
Thanks, Paige!

1383
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:31,620
It was very cute.

1384
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,660
Very cute collection.

1385
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,380
Let's go back to blue sky.

1386
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,720
Let's see what we got.

1387
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:39,820
I'm going through.

1388
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:40,600
I'm going through.

1389
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:46,600
Sorry, also, if your collection does not make it, like I
said, I'll be doing it again.

1390
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,040
But also, I'm kind of just picking things that, like, meet
my eyes.

1391
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:59,060
like you know so it's not that you have a bad collection
it's just me kind of like I'm trying to what's the word I

1392
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:17,260
like to get a kind of variety going on like so this is real
Runa with a scissor collection Wow

1393
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,080
A scissor collection.

1394
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,920
I've never thought of somebody collecting scissors.

1395
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:38,520
Wait, I have that cinnamarol blue eyes with dragon also.

1396
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,460
Wait, I like the cinnamarol scissors too and the Karomi
scissors.

1397
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,060
Wait, these are scissors!

1398
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:51,940
Fumoko?

1399
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,140
They're cute!

1400
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,100
Cool.

1401
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,220
yet worrying.

1402
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,420
I like these ones too in their sleeves.

1403
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:12,060
It's like I've never seen someone decorate their wall with
scissors.

1404
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:13,940
Phoebe!

1405
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:18,080
It's a Phoebe.

1406
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:19,640
May dream?

1407

01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:30,800
Yippee!

1409
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,720
That's how Phoebe says it.

1410
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,780
Cute and pushing.

1411
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,580
I've never seen anyone decorate with scissors before.

1412
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:44,800
I'm so fascinated.

1413
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:48,700
What?

1414
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,780
I'm curious though what dictates whether they're shut like
this or whether they're open?

1415
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:56,880
Hmm.

1416
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:10,360

most unique scissors you know like some of these like this

1418
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:27,080

01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:34,520
just the cute designs on them like it's Maybe a stationary
washi tape otaku.

01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:36,660
Oh, maybe it.

01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:40,380
So fun.

1422
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:43,440
Oh my gosh, I didn't even see the Kiara tapestry.

1423
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,540
Wow, that's awesome.

1424
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,120
That's so nice.

1425
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,320

Wow.

1428
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:58,660
He says, here's my computer desk featuring my scissor
collection on the wall.

1429
01:42:59,580 --> 01:42:59,980
Wow.

1430
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,000
So cool!

1431
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,080
Uh...

1432
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:11,880
Let's see.

1433
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,400
Hmm.

1434
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:20,960
Do-do-do-do-do.

1435
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,300
Do-do-do-do.

1436
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,280
I'm scrolling.

1437
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:25,900
I'm looking.

1438
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,460
I'm observing.

1439
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:31,780
I'm looking at everybody's rooms.

1440
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,140
Oh my gosh, Orca.

1441
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,280
The dolls in your room are so cute.

1442
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:40,600
The Orca pluses are so cute.

1443
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,620
Drossil.

1444
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,920
That's my robot wife.

1445
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:50,620
I love her.

1446
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,000
I love her.

1447
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,840
I'm currently out of town right now.

1448
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,800
This is all I have in my camera roll for my collection.

1449
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:06,110
bird.

1450
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,570
Oh, cute!

1451
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:12,330
Wait!

1452
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,930
Are these like decks themed to each of us?

1453
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:20,270
That's me!

1454
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:21,630
That's you!

1455
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:26,530
Wait, this is so cute!

1456
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:29,470
They're so cute!

1457
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:32,350
Oh my gosh, the little matching stickers and everything!

1458
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:35,270
That's really...

1459
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,330
Oh, my gosh.

1460
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:37,110
Oh my gosh, that's such a cute idea.

1461
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:43,050
And I like how each of us have like the blue and the mint.

1462
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,790
Nimmies looks red?

1463
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:49,330
I can't tell if it's because of the table or not though.

1464
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,590
The colored sleeves are satisfying.

1465
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:52,650
Yeah, yeah!

1466
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:55,190
This is so stinking cute.

1467
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:59,170
Legendary creature spirit warrior.

1468
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,590
I like that Nimmies got dinosaur.

1469
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,550
For evil Nimi.

1470
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:11,630
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1471
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:14,910
Cute!

1472
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:16,290
I love this.

1473
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,910
Love your card collection.

1474
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,030
Thank you for sharing.

1475
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:20,810
Thank you, thank you.

1476
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:23,350
Let's see what we got else.

1477
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:26,370
Toot, toot, toot, toot.

1478
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:29,530
This person says...

1479
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:29,930
Oh, whoops.

1480
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:30,810
Oh, no.

1481
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:31,190
Oh, no.

1482
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:32,270
Oh, no.

1483
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:32,730
Wait.

1484
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:33,110
Oh, no.

1485
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:33,950
Oh, okay, good.

1486
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:34,230
Wait.

1487
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:36,040
Okay, we're good.

1488
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:41,110
This person said I did not clean my room.

1489
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:44,910
Wait, let me double check these before I...

1490
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:45,930
Oh my god.

1491
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:24,160
You play drums?

1492
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:25,380
Maybe?

1493
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,600
Oh.

1494
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:01,070
Where are your sheets?

1495
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:05,830
Where are your bed sheets?

1496
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:08,150
Oh, you really like Arizona.

1497
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:09,190
Oh no, green teeth.

1498
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:11,210
That's pretty good.

1499
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:18,050
We're gaming?

1500
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:20,130
We're gaming?

1501
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,270
R slash male living space.

1502
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,920
A single can.

1503
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,500
What's this one?

1504
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:34,860
I don't know this brand.

1505
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:37,540
The 3DS?

1506
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,520
On top of them.

1507
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,860
Honestly, the whole...

1508
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,780
You have a lot of clutter around here, but this is like very
cleanable.

1509
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,000
Honestly, like it could be worse.

1510
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:55,540
Like your floor looks like it could be worse.

1511
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,120
I have faith in you.

1512
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:01,340
Fazbear Fanta.

1513
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,280
It is!

1514
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,960
That's a pretty Fazbear?

1515
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,080
Oh, it does say Fanta.

1516
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:06,760
You're right.

1517
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:15,970
This doesn't look so bad to clean up.

1518
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:16,890
Look, you got a printer.

1519
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:19,270
And you're very...

1520
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:20,970
Uh...

1521
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:21,430
Uh...

1522
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:22,170
Resourceful.

1523
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:25,250
You don't have a table for it, so you're using a box.

1524
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:30,500
And the painting looks very nice.

1525
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,160
And you're doing renovations, obviously.

1526
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,040
And that's why you have...

1527
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:47,580
Uh...

1528
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,100
All you just gotta do is vacuum.

1529
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,040
Oh, those are MREs.

1530
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:55,340
A lot of them.

1531
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:01,360
But you also like mac and cheese and a burrito?

1532
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,400
Look at the wall.

1533
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:16,780
What?

1534
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:17,880
I saw.

1535
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:22,560
Nice, Sarah.

1536
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:51,580
This is so cute!

1537
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,580
Oh my gosh, pin collection!

1538
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,700
Wow!

1539
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,520
Look at all the pins!

1540
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,640
Wait, are these like locations that you've been to?

1541
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,080
Bigfoot?

1542
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,080
Wait, this is such a cute way to display them.

1543
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:09,920
Wow!

1544
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,340
And the plushy hammock?

1545
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:21,390
This is so cute!

1546
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:27,830
I like how all the white-haired anime characters are here
and then the Miku's are here.

1547
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:33,110
Big ol' aboos, big ol' aboos.

1548
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:39,710
I like the plushy hammock idea, but I'm scared of spiders.

1549
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:42,990
I've heard spiders get in there.

1550
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:43,590
Is that true?

1551
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,380
True.

1552
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:51,120
Real.

1553
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,120
Understandable.

1554
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,020
Why did you have to bring that up?

1555
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,180
Because, uh...

1556
01:50:59,180 --> 01:50:59,520
Hmm.

1557
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:01,320
Oh!

1558
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,400
This is so...

1559
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,880
This is the cutest ever.

1560
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:18,880

1567
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,620

Bought a crab instead.

1586
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,960

01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,680
Oh, God.

1612
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,700
A paint, your sister painted him.

1613
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:42,560
The eye blue.

1614
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,400
Cute.

1615
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:45,820
Cute, cute, cute.

1616
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:47,720
Cute, cute, cute.

1617
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,620
Wait, I like the other paintings too.

1618
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:50,640
Wait, this is not a painting.

1619
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,680
I like how you can see the eye blue reflection.

1620
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,020
In the water.

1621
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,320
It's so...

1622
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,420
It's like a...

1623
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,440
It's like...

1624
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:07,780
One of those Photoshopped, like, in the sky.

1625
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,780
I kind of like...

1626
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:12,000
Like that guy that goes...

1627
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,800
You know what I'm talking about?

1628
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,400
Oh, old shelf that got too full.

1629
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:20,940
Oh my goodness.

1630
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:24,900
More CDs?

1631
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,420
She hates us?

1632
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,160
Very cute.

1633
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,140
Very cute.

1634
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,840
Why do you look like that?

1635
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,700
Why you look like that though?

1636
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,140
Why you look like that though?

1637
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,860
Looks delicious.

1638
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:59,000
I need it.

1639
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,380
Thank you again for sharing!

1640
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:03,080
Thank you, thank you.

1641
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:05,240
Let's see.

1642
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,300
Let me go back to blue sky.

1643
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:28,780
Whoa!

1644
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:34,600
Oh my gosh, Usni, this looks so fancy!

01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:57,840

1646
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:07,620

1647
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:10,800
Oh my gosh.

1648
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,300
Is that Wishbone?

1649
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:14,640
This guy right here?

1650
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:15,180
I don't know.

1651
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:15,700
Might be.

1652
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,360
The manga on the top shelf.

1653
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:24,760
It's like how a fancy wine goes on the top shelf.

1654
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,060
The finest of materials.

1655
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,780
Goes at the very tip top.

1656
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,480
Who needs Google when you can consult the archives?

1657
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:46,980
Usni is the encyclopedia you have twilight in fact you have
the entire twilight series oh i see these blurred out photos

01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:23,830
The...

1661
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,250
The...

1662
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:24,370
The...

1663
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:29,430
The...

1664
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:33,890
Garfield.

1665
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:38,590
One of these things is not like the other.

1666
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:45,670
I've never seen this.

1667
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:47,530
This mint plushie is cute.

1668
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:49,090
Hmm.

1669
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:51,910
Garfield.

1670
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:53,610
Cute!

1671
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:56,530
Thanks for sharing, thanks for sharing.

1672
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:58,370
Thank you, thank you.

1673
01:59:00,590 --> 01:59:01,050
Let's see.

1674
01:59:01,730 --> 01:59:02,610
I'll scroll through.

1675
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:05,030
I'm gonna try and find one that...

1676
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:06,270
Whoa!

1677
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,430
Hold on.

1678
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:11,770
What?

1679
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,870
What is this?

1680
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:20,510
A NASCAR bumper from 2013.

1681
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:27,190
Are you really into Daskar?

1682
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:35,490
It's kind of, this picture is really trippy because it feels
like it's photoshopped.

1683
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:41,490
It feels like this is, wait, right?

1684
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:47,130
It doesn't feel, it feels like I'm, it's hurting my eyes and
my brain a little bit.

1685
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,490
It does, right?

1686
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:54,730
This doesn't, because there's no shadow or anything.

1687
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:58,130
And the headlights, those are not real.

1688
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,490
Are those like...

1689
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:07,130
The...

1690
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:08,270
Finn, I'm confused.

1691
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:13,970
And even this, this is like painted on, no?

1692
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:21,100
Been a fan since I was a kid.

1693
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:23,220
This is the most confusing.

1694
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,400
photo I've ever seen.

1695
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:32,350
NASCAR uses stickers.

1696
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,150
They do!

1697
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:39,290
Today I learned.

1698
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:40,370
What?

1699
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:51,370
You haven't seen cars?

1700
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:52,150
Uh-uh.

1701
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:56,270
I've never seen cars before.

1702
02:00:57,690 --> 02:00:58,630
Should we do a watch-along?

1703
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,710
I just know perfume is in there.

1704
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:03,170
In one of the movies.

1705
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:09,250
Headlights are heavy and not very aerodynamic.

1706
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:15,660
Groucho!

1707
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:22,820
I met Owen Wilson.

1708
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,940
He's very nice.

1709
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,040
He is...

1710
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,300
Lightning McQueen.

1711
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:37,510
Huh.

1712
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:39,910
And then also...

1713
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:46,570
Wow, you're really into cars!

1714
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:53,330
You need a better display case than this.

1715
02:01:53,870 --> 02:02:00,650
This is what I mean, I meant earlier when I say, like, I
like when my display cases are all glass because it's easier

1716
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:01,630
to see in there.

1717
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:09,910
This car uses fiberglass bodies because they all have the
same chassis, but just different bodies.

1718
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:18,810
to make cars more similar also less debris that's that's
that's scary this room earns a score of hell yeah

1719
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:41,180
chassis oh chassis chassis I learned fast and furious very
cool collection

1720
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:49,720
I love the BP tanker truck.

1721
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,860
Just like the real ones.

1722
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:01,060
It's so good.

1723
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,780
Oh my gosh.

1724
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:04,820
Thank you so much.

1725
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:07,240
I love for the five gifted.

1726
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:07,960
Thank you.

1727
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,020
Oh my gosh.

1728
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,400
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

1729
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,060
Thank you.

1730
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,260
Thank you so much.

1731
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,480
And then a few guitar controllers I've collected.

1732
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:22,680
These are so cool.

1733
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,400
Wait, what happened to this one?

1734
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,580
In the middle.

1735
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:27,640
Wait, I love the...

1736
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,280
The...

1737
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,820
Wait, the displays for these.

1738
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,080
That's so cool!

1739
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:38,380
Wow!

1740
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,020
It fell.

1741
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,740
Oh no!

1742
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:44,720
Oh no!

1743
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:47,260
These are so cool.

1744
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,960

Cute, cute.

1747
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:29,400
I didn't know there was such a variety of guitar
controllers.

1748
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,040
Are there more than this?

1749
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,200
Like, is how...

1750
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:35,780
I mean, I was never into guitar hero.

1751
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:39,420
But some of these, like, are really...

1752
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,720
Like, the classic-looking ones.

1753
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,760
Like, this one looks, like, almost like acoustic.

1754
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:46,020
There are way more.

1755
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:46,600
Really?

1756
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,400
Tons.

1757
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:48,920
Wow.

1758
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:50,440
That's so fun.

1759
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,900
You should get more.

1760
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:52,960
You should get more, Finn.

1761
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,340

So thank you very much.

02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:05,420
Let's see.

1780
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,020
Oh my gosh, Tori, you're a Chica idol.

1781
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:13,900
Shelf is so stinking cute.

1782
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,220
Oh my god.

1783
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:24,560
I love this description.

1784
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:25,740
I just moved everything.

1785
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,980
I just moved so everything is messy still.

1786
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:29,500
Where?

1787
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,240
Where?

1788
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:34,060
Mess?

1789
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,920
Messy.

1790
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:37,420
Where?

1791
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:43,410
The...

1792
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,070
The light?

1793
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:57,110
I don't think I belong in such a cute room!

1794
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:01,150
Kangal!

1795
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:04,670
Oh my gosh!

1796
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:07,070
I don't belong here!

1797
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:09,730
Ow!

1798
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:13,250
Oh my god, twist.

1799
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:21,350
This is so cute!

1800
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:24,410
Do do do.

1801
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:29,610
Wait, I'm obsessed with the axolotl on the pink pink.

1802
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:30,990
And the Hanamaru!

1803
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:40,140
It's pink.

1804
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,640
The pink monster.

1805
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:44,440
Oh my gosh, you really are a Jedi girly.

1806
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,920
Wait, the Lego!

1807
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:48,780
This is amazing.

1808
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:50,080
The Lego bouquet.

1809
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,620
I'm so obsessed.

1810
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:58,020
You can clearly see part of the room is pixelated.

1811
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,320
They haven't fully rendered it in yet.

1812
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:03,700
The Tsikawa's in the ghost!

1813
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,060
Their favorite color must be yellow.

1814
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:09,940
Must be.

1815
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:13,700
Wait, I'm getting such inspiration from this.

1816
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:17,720
The curtains with the ribbon!

1817
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,240
I love it!

1818
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:21,500
I love it!

1819
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,460
it so much.

1820
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:26,380
I can't wait to move so I can redecorate everything and
reorganize everything.

1821
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:30,140
I can't convince me that an actual princess doesn't live
here.

1822
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:39,040
So the Vita bag is... Oh my god!

1823
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:42,940
I'm so obsessed.

1824
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:46,620
I'm sorry that I'm that I am mint.

1825
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:51,240
I need to make more pink merch.

1826
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,900
Wait, and the ghost lights!

1827
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,800
The ghost fairy lights are so cute!

1828
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:05,860
It's a complimentary color.

1829
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:12,540
I need to become... I need to become more pink, more blue.

1830
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:18,260
Redo my color scheme.

1831
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,500
I rename myself and everything.

1832
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:37,140
I could still be named Mint and not be the color mint
probably it's pink this is like oh my gosh I don't even

1833
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:46,820

princess that you are let me be your made please.

1835
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,040
Minto is an accent.

1836
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,020
Oh, she in this pink room.

1837
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:07,860
Rin, thank you so much for sharing your cute otaku room.

1840
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:19,880
So stinking cute.

1841
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:25,090
Okay.

1842
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:25,930
Okay.

1844
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,460
Oh my gosh.

02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,080
There's so many good...

02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,860
So many, so many good rooms!

1847
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,840
They're all so good!

1848
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,620
I want to feature everybody.

1849
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,240
I'm like scrolling through and I'm like...

1850
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:47,780
And then I scroll through and I'm like...

1851
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:48,920
And then I scroll and I'm like...

1852
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,400
All of them are so good!

1853
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:54,760
Everything is so nice!

1854
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:56,940
Good job, everybody.

1855
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,540
Good job.

1856
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:05,280
I'm in the middle of building a minch shrine in my office
Couldn't make it for this stream, but I hope to show it off

1857
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,660

02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,780
Okay, what the heck is this?

1861
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:31,940
Okay.

1862
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:34,440
Too much of...

1863
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:36,200
My room's too much of a mess to show off.

1864
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:41,240
But here's a collection of a gacha poem from my Japan trip
as well as my humble collection of CDs.

1865
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:44,260
Yeah, okay, well, like, you talk about that.

1866
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:48,100
But first of all, I love that you went to Jam Akihabara.

1867
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:50,460
Good, good, good, good, good.

1868
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,480
Good, good, good.

1869
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:53,580
And then...

1870
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:55,380
I guess these are your gacha.

1871
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,640
But, um, why did you...

1872
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,820
Oh, here's your CDs.

1873
02:11:59,060 --> 02:11:59,380
Ah!

1874
02:11:59,580 --> 02:11:59,860
Ah!

1875
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:00,700
Ah!

1876
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:03,880
I have some of these... I have...

1877
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,620
This blue archive one too.

1878
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:07,700
Um...

1879
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:09,820
I was very excited about your A1 collab.

1880
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:10,720
Thank you!

1881
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,320
But, uh... What is this?

1882
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:23,420
Why don't you make any mention of that in your description?

1883
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:33,930
We're just gonna...

1884
02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:35,890
We're just gonna pass up the...

1885
02:12:35,890 --> 02:12:38,210
Pass over the...

1886
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:38,930
The cosplay?

1887
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:44,290
With me in the belt!

1888
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:47,610
It looks sick!

1889
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:50,570
It's so cool!

1890
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:54,530
Normal house decoration.

1891
02:12:55,470 --> 02:13:04,130
This is why if you buy, if you also get like the Minto
cosplay, you could set it up like this and you could just

1892
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:07,970
always have, you know, a little ghost haunts in your house.

1893
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:10,910
Wow!

1894
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:19,160
It looks so good!

1895
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,480
Oh my god!

1896
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,620
John Elden Ring.

1897
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,600
It looks so awesome!

1898
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,760
Oh my gosh, thank you for sharing.

1899
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,120
Okay, I'm gonna like just try and click through a bunch.

1900
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:46,940
Look at all your warhammer!

1901
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:49,680
Miniatures!

1902
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:50,760
Tasme!

1903
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:53,100
It's amazing.

1904
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:56,780
Working on an otaku full sleeve tattoo!

1905
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:59,740
Maybe I could sneak Aminto in somewhere for the collection.

1906
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:01,900
Oh my gosh.

1907
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:04,200
Don't tattoo me on your body.

1908
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:08,740
Don't tattoo me on your body.

1909
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:12,860
But I would love to see an otaku tattoo.

1910
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,040
Oh my gosh.

1911
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:15,800
I love this setup.

1912
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:18,160
with this setup.

1913
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:20,340
I love the camels.

1914
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,900
I love the camels up here, but I love the lighting.

1915
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,720
It's so warm and cozy.

1916
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:29,060
I love warm lighting like this.

1917
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:33,420

This is so beautiful.

1920
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:43,080
Come haunt me for a bit, Minto.

02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:43,940

1922
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:44,760

I love to see you hang up the cosplay.

1944
02:16:08,110 --> 02:16:09,430
Nice little decoration.

1945
02:16:10,750 --> 02:16:12,350

They're really cute, though.

1960
02:17:13,890 --> 02:17:15,650

What is the ceiling?

1996
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,420
This is like an office ceiling.

02:20:55,210 --> 02:20:56,310
I need to argue again.

2019
02:20:57,110 --> 02:21:00,290
Remember how I said putting things in frames?

2020
02:21:00,990 --> 02:21:02,910
