1
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,050
Yippee!

2
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,250
Yippee!

3
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,510
Paragon!

4
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,090
Paragon!

5
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,650
Paragon!

6
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,270
Paragon!

7
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,150
Paragon!

8
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,490
Paragon!

9
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,130
Paragon!

10
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,630
Paragon!

11
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,450
Welcome back!

12
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,170
Master!

13
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:52,750
Lady!

14
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,630
Hello!

15
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,370
Welcome back to...

16
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,670
Eternal Darkness!

17
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:01,990
Yeah!

18
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,110
If it isn't the sauciest ghost out there!

19
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,830
Today I am all powerful.

20
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,690
I am backed by the power of Paragon.

21
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,910
Yay!

22
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,970
You guys like my...

23
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,410
My magic spell?

24
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,490
You guys like it?

25
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,790
I decided to be very colorful.

26
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,090
I picked some good colors.

27
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,730
I actually didn't pick a single mint color.

28
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,290
Oops.

29
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,090
Just pretend the green is mint, okay?

30
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,930
Just pretend the green is mint.

31
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,690
Hi Minto, hello!

32
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,410
What element are you?

33
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,320
Fire, cause I'm spicy.

34
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,460
How do you like my magic spell, Snake?

35
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,800
Cool.

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
You didn't even pick mint for your own colors.

37
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,800
It's fine.

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,300
It's giving PC-98 Marisa...

39
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,500
Good.

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,060
Love that.

41
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,400
Master Spark.

42
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,380
Did she have Master Spark back in PC-98?

43
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,100
Don't remember.

44
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,220
Anyway!

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
My Tia just got it.

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,300
It's still very hot.

47
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,980
Why is there a clown nose on your forehead?

48
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,700
I thought that maybe it looked a bit like a clown nose.

49
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,620
But I was hoping you guys would say Rudolph instead.

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,280
Nice Infinity Stones?

51
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you.

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,060
Oh, I'm sorry you can't hear the...

53
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,780
Sorry.

54
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,120
Anytime I play a game on like my PlayStation or whatever, you guys can't hear the...

55
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,180
The don't know sounds.

56
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,280
Cause if I do this...

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,580
Then you can't hear it at all.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
It's all complicated stuff, okay?

60
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
It's complicated stuff.

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,540
It's complicated OBS things.

62
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,040
But yeah, so welcome back.

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,500
Eternal Darkness Part 4.

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,480
I thought initially when I first made...

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,340
Especially since last stream, some people were like, oh yeah, I think you could finish this stream.

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,100
I think...

67
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm going to go through just one chapter today.

68
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,800
I think we have three chapters.

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,180
I think I'm going to go through one chapter today.

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,140
I have some stuff I need to finish up tonight.

71
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,920
So if I go through one chapter...

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,100
That's why I kind of started at a strange time too.

73
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,080
I was like, I'm going to start at this time.

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Especially because I was going to play on the weekend and start a couple hours earlier.

75
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,480
But then I had some stuff I had to take care of with my cat.

76
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,000
And...

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,840
I...

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh.

79
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
I have five chapters?

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,020
I thought it was just three.

81
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,620
Wait.

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,020
Am I getting one guide?

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,580
You have a hundred.

84
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,800
I missed half the stream last time.

85
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,420
What has happened?

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh gosh.

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,840
Wait, it's five.

88
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,680
There's four plus the girl left.

89
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,840
I thought it was three.

90
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:39,930
Wait.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,430
Nah, I'm not going to play through the whole game again to get the final ending.

92
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,950
I'm so sorry.

93
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,570
We can watch it on YouTube or something.

94
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,570
Four plus one equals three.

95
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,280
Wait, Minto did four minus the girl instead of four.

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,920
No, I didn't do any four minus plus anything.

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,200
I read in chat.

98
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,460
Some people were like, oh, she has three chapters left.

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,240
So if anything, it's those people.

100
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,920
Why?

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,740
Minto stream right as I get off work this Monday.

102
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,220
Yippee!

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,660
I heard you like Paragon.

104
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,980
So we put Paragon in your spell so you can Paragon when you Paragon.

105
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Wait, I'm so confused.

106
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,920
Never trust chat.

107
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I'm so confused now.

108
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,620
Because I don't even remember what chapter we're on.

109
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,160
And I was leaving it up to you.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,440
I was like, oh, you guys keep up so well.

111
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,300
You guys keep up so well.

112
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,800
I only have this many chapters left.

113
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,540
Okay.

114
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Well, we'll get through what I get through today.

115
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,220
And...

116
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,460
We'll get through what I get through today.

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,180
I might just do one chapter today.

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,920
And then...

119
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,580
What I was saying is I might do one chapter today.

120
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,740
And then...

121
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,320
Um...

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,000
Uh...

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
And then...

124
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,120
Because I have some stuff I need to do.

125
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:21,700
And then once I'm back from my trip, I can endurance the rest of the game without any worry of time or limits or anything like that.

126
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,660
And feel a little bit more relaxed in terms of playing it.

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
And not like, oh, I got to get through this because I got to get through this.

128
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,620
I have a question.

129
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,980
I can make Doki play any one video game.

130
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,980
Charity thing.

131
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,320
Would you like it to be MGS?

132
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,960
MGS.

133
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,960
Would Doki like Metal Gear?

134
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,380
I don't know.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,720
I've been sick for four days.

136
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,080
Can you scare my cold away?

137
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,820
I don't know if she would like it.

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Make her play Winnie the Pooh?

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,540
There's a mint...

140
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,380
Para...

141
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,080
Para...

142
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Para...

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,700
Paracombe.

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,240
What?

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,560
That's what I was worried about too.

146
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,820
I think she would maybe enjoy the story.

147
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,660
But it's like maybe not her type of game.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Turquoise soup for the minto.

149
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,860
You mean the mint?

150
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,520
Mint soup for the minto.

151
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,600
Make her play VR horror instead.

152
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Oh god.

153
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,660
Why don't you play?

154
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,540
Have her play...

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,780
Have her play what you want.

156
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,260
Wait, why?

157
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,020
It doesn't have to be Metal Gear.

158
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
You asked me if you want to play Metal Gear, it's okay.

159
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,040
It was always...

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,460
Almost encouraged to pick something she wouldn't normally play.

161
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:55,780
Oh.

162
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,860
I sent her

163
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,520
a picture earlier this morning too.

164
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,440
I was like, when our fandoms collide.

165
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,980
I lied, and it was a picture that someone drew of Garfield as Snake.

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,340
I was like...

167
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,420
This is us.

168
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,740
What about...

169
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay...

170
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,100
Hear me out.

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,500
This might be a little weird, but...

172
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,720
And it's not...

173
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,340
We don't even know when it's coming out, but what about Delta?

174
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,040
Because, you know, I could recommend MGS5 for the controls, because that's way more up her alley, but like...

175
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,140
Delta could be kind of...

176
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
You know, interesting.

177
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,540
For her to start with.

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,160
Depending.

179
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,080
But it's not out yet.

180
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,140
Do you need to make a...

181
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,280
Could you say, like, Delta?

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,680
Whenever it's coming out?

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Nexi, ultimately, it's up to you.

184
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,960
It's up to you, baby girl.

185
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,580
Can you play VR Alien Isolation with her?

186
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,040
No!

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,300
I can't play Alien...

188
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
VR Alien Isol...

189
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't play Alien Isolation as it is.

190
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,640
By itself.

191
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,160
You think I'm gonna play it in VR?

192
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
You think I'm gonna play it with her?

193
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,840
You know what she would do?

194
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,920
She would hide in the corner, and she would be like...

195
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,060
Mint!

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,560
Mint!

197
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,960
Go do the thing!

198
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,040
Go do the thing, Mint!

199
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,020
And I'd be like...

200
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,420
We have to do this together, Noki!

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,360
And she'd be like...

202
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,560
Eternal darkness to our worlds without you.

203
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Stop.

204
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,860
Okay.

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,200
And I would be too scared to do anything, too!

206
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,660
Paragon, paragon.

207
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
Paragon, paragon.

208
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,540
Paragon.

209
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,400
Okay.

210
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,760
Eternal darkness.

211
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,540
Where did we last leave off on?

212
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,060
Let me see.

213
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,540
Hold on.

214
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,060
We have been going kind of through time.

215
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,520
So the first thing that we did was we were Indiana Jones.

216
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,000
And that guy was kind of awesome.

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,260
We had a shotgun.

218
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,260
Love that thing.

219
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
We just kind of like obliterated everything.

220
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,840
It was so great.

221
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,340
If you loved us, you'd play Alien Isolation VR.

222
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,180
I don't even know.

223
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,360
I truly didn't even know that it was on VR.

224
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,280
I'll be honest.

225
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,360
And then afterwards, we played as a poor little guy.

226
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,920
He went to the church.

227
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,200
We went back in time.

228
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,480
Back to where that...

229
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,720
Oh my gosh.

230
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,260
The French...

231
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,360
We went to the French.

232
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,020
Thanks so much for the advice.

233
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,220
Good luck.

234
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sure whenever you pick, it will be great.

235
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Tia!

236
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,760
I turned 21 today.

237
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,540
Can I get a Happy Birthday?

238
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:48,900
Oh!

239
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,780
Tia!

240
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,540
Happy birthday to you!

241
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,020
Happy birthday to you!

242
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880
Happy birthday dear Tia!

243
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,280
Happy birthday dear Tia!

244
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,090
I can't believe Mint wants Doki to start with Delta.

245
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:23,850
Okay.

246
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,790
I want Doki to suffer.

247
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,870
So maybe, you know what?

248
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,410
Have her play that Winnie the Pooh game.

249
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,470
I don't care.

250
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,010
Have her play a rage game.

251
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,030
Getting over it until she has to beat it.

252
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,470
For charity.

253
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,810
I don't know.

254
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,570
What was that?

255
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,510
Syphilis game or whatever?

256
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,330
Where you push the boulder up?

257
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,210
Have her play that one.

258
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,930
Oh, and so, yeah, we were...

259
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,050
We, oh, Alex Roivas.

260
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,230
We were this priest.

261
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,730
We're not Alex Roivas, sorry.

262
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,750
We were a priest and that guy was weak as hell.

263
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,930
But we, you know, managed.

264
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,310
We went back to the church.

265
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,010
There was that one guy who was trying to warn the captain of his demise.

266
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,150
But then this guy turned into a zombie.

267
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,790
There was him and we had to kill him.

268
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,670
You want her to start with Delta?

269
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,130
Awesome.

270
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,370
Use Ape Escape to fake her.

271
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:22,750
Yeah.

272
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,410
Alien Isolation is not in VR unless you mod it.

273
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,570
So it probably would be...

274
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,430
Since it's not optimized, quote unquote, for VR.

275
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,830
It probably would be super headache, motion sick inducing.

276
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,850
Now we are about to start a new...

277
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,210
A new area.

278
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,190
A new chapter.

279
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,790
Which people said this one is kind of...

280
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes, the priest got his head blown up by the floating creature.

281
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,460
There is a creature...

282
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,940
There is a... Sorry, I just spat.

283
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,620
There is a creature that is guarding...

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,120
Something.

285
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,720
And it's...

286
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,160
We got to probably kill that thing.

287
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,720
Dum dum.

288
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,240
Dum dum.

289
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
That's probably going to be the boss battle.

290
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,860
Of the final game.

291
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,380
Maybe.

292
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,880
Gonna raw dog Syphilis.

293
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,080
What?

294
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,880
What?

295
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,420
Roberto is a low point but it's still fun.

296
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,480
Guy has terrible stats.

297
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,540
Okay, okay.

298
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,100
What?

299
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,720
It wasn't me.

300
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,380
It was the super child.

301
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,430
Okay.

302
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,390
We got our chapter.

303
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,250
Oh!

304
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,850
I didn't mean to do that.

305
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,730
I meant to do this.

306
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,530
I meant to do this.

307
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,790
I meant to do this.

308
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,170
It appears to be a page from the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

309
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,010
It appears to be a page from the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

310
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,290
It is entitled the Forbidden City.

311
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,630
Should Alex read it?

312
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,090
Give me a second.

313
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,150
So yeah.

314
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,150
We learned...

315
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,450
Hold on.

316
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,290
We learned some crazy stuff last time as well.

317
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,590
Look at this.

318
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,430
We now have a...

319
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,170
Is that a pentagon?

320
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,130
What shape is that?

321
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,730
I need to go back to school.

322
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:47,790
Yes.

323
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,490
We have a pentagon.

324
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,290
And a square plus one.

325
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:58,870
Exactly.

326
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,950
Look.

327
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,510
We can make so many more spells.

328
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,570
Actually.

329
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,070
We have almost figured out all the spells.

330
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,430
So that's exciting.

331
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,650
So that's exciting.

332
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh wait.

333
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,810
We haven't done summon trap or...

334
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,090
I just noticed...

335
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,610
My game is wide.

336
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,210
My game is wide.

337
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,350
My game is wide.

338
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,490
I think I messed up.

339
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,450
Wait.

340
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,550
Guys I think I messed up before.

341
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,410
I'm so sorry.

342
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,110
I'll shrink myself.

343
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,090
It wasn't so wide before.

344
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,370
Oops.

345
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,290
I forgot the settings.

346
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,670
My bad.

347
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,410
My bad.

348
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,470
Um.

349
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,310
Okay.

350
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,250
Wide.

351
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,350
Wide screen.

352
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,490
Wide screen.

353
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,130
Um.

354
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,470
But yeah.

355
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,850
We have like almost all the spells.

356
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,090
I don't remember what this one does.

357
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,170
But it's a...

358
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,370
We got...

359
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,110
I don't remember what this one does either.

360
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,250
I don't...

361
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,130
I never collected the stuff.

362
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,610
My bad.

363
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,790
I never collected the little codex.

364
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:08,810
Um.

365
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,630
This one summons a trapper.

366
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,450
And then...

367
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,430
Does this one summon the zombie?

368
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,530
Number 8 is summon zombie?

369
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,610
And then we control the zombie.

370
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,190
And then we have to kill our own zombie.

371
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,030
Kind of sucks.

372
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,530
We'll get...

373
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,590
I'll get used to it.

374
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,110
I'll remember.

375
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,610
I'll remember once we start getting into it.

376
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,370
Okay.

377
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,390
I don't know why I...

378
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,730
Let's use this chapter.

379
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,290
Let's go...

380
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,190
Conqueror?

381
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,110
Oh.

382
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,590
But what is not is far more interesting.

383
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,770
The Tome of Eternal Darkness mentions a Venetian artist and architect of the Renaissance.

384
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,710
Named Roberto Bianchi.

385
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:01,970
Bianchi?

386
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,530
Roaming abroad to find inspiration.

387
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,830
He was captured by a warlord.

388
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,350
Expanding his empire.

389
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,950
He forced Roberto to use his architectural and engineering skills.

390
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,630
To construct a monument to his greatness.

391
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,090
Oh.

392
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,210
To complete his task.

393
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,810
He must survey the site.

394
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,050
Okay.

395
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,590
1460.

396
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,190
Bianchi.

397
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,430
Roberto Mancini.

398
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,950
Was it... okay.

399
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,450
Survey the site quickly, dog.

400
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,450
And maybe you'll live long enough to see the sacrament's construction.

401
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,450
And maybe you'll live long enough to see the sacrament's construction.

402
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,710
I'm the architect.

403
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,950
Right?

404
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,270
It's me.

405
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,070
You need me.

406
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,370
What?

407
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,070
Did you think we would trust you, Bianchi?

408
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,090
Bianchi.

409
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,390
Even though you are graced with the generosity of our liege.

410
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,230
You are still his prisoner.

411
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,130
As I said.

412
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,830
Finish your work quickly.

413
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,570
And maybe we'll drag you out of this hole.

414
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,190
I'm gonna become...

415
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,250
I'm gonna become the devil down here.

416
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,370
Roberto was the Picasso architect.

417
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:16,950
Stop.

418
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,610
Roberto must survey the ruins of this ancient temple.

419
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,890
The ruins he must survey can be found on the map.

420
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,210
Only when these areas have been inspected can the construction begin.

421
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,390
Only when these areas have been inspected can the construction begin.

422
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,610
Do I have a map?

423
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,690
I have a torch?

424
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,270
From the get-go?

425
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,170
Yeah, baby.

426
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,830
What's the map?

427
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,570
The foundation for the monument has been constructed.

428
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,630
But it has suffered some damage.

429
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,230
Why?

430
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,110
How has it suffered damage already?

431
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,370
It's still being built.

432
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,190
The rest of the complex is unknown and Roberto must discover if construction can continue.

433
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,490
The rest of the complex is unknown and Roberto must discover if construction can continue.

434
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,910
Maybe don't build your monument in the ground.

435
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,290
Maybe don't build your monument in the ground.

436
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,890
Maybe don't build your monument in the ground.

437
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,650
Novel idea.

438
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,350
Just kidding, we're going up.

439
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,610
Whoa!

440
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
So I have to make...

441
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,560
Who the hell are you?

442
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,580
Are you also stuck here?

443
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,340
Are you...

444
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,180
A frantic worker looking for answers to questions that can't be answered.

445
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,380
He hopes Roberto is there to save them and longs to see his family and friends once he escapes.

446
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm also stuck here, man.

447
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,780
What's this?

448
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,040
This will lead us to the town.

449
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,580
Probably.

450
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,680
Okay, if you're a worker, get to work, man.

451
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,760
What are you doing?

452
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,940
This place isn't going to build itself.

453
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,240
Oh, my bad.

454
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,180
Why is there damage to this building?

455
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,760
Can you give my bro Luke some motivation to go to the gym?

456
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
He's not feeling it.

457
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,480
Luke!

458
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,340
Luke, you're going to feel so much better after you go to the gym.

459
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,340
I swear.

460
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,740
I promise you.

461
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,580
All you got to do is go and then once you go, you're just like, Oh, I'm so glad I went.

462
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,480
Can I set this guy on fire?

463
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,660
No, he just wants to see his friends and family.

464
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
You got to go, Luke.

465
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,520
You got to go.

466
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,540
That's an order.

467
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,100
I hear something squishy.

468
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,040
Why are you already here?

469
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,840
What the?

470
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,840
My torch!

471
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay, good.

472
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,540
Finish him?

473
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,660
Oh, nope, he's dead.

474
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,540
Why are there zombies in your monument?

475
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,680
What just happened?

476
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,900
He's just...

477
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,880
Are you going to die already?

478
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,960
Roberto is so fine.

479
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,100
I love this guy.

480
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,260
I've known him for two...

481
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,300
Oh, no!

482
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,780
Oh, no!

483
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,200
One of Roberto's fellow slaves lies dead!

484
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,760
His wounds seem to have attracted the attention of the beasts.

485
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,680
For they have been gnawed open.

486
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,160
Spilling his innards onto the dusty floor.

487
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,770
Spilling his innards onto the dusty floor.

488
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,450
Thanks to the gifted!

489
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,130
Ghost exploring her natural habitat.

490
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,310
Oh, hello everyone.

491
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,070
What just happened?

492
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,530
What is this sound?

493
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,490
I see this.

494
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,210
Is that arrows?

495
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,930
Oh, crossbow!

496
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh, we're going to get a crossbow!

497
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:52,970
Some day.

498
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,490
Eventually.

499
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,990
Should Roberto try to survey this area?

500
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,710
Wait, I'm scared.

501
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,930
Hold on, let me look around first.

502
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,030
I don't know what happens once I survey a place.

503
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,810
Can I set this on fire?

504
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,070
What is going on here?

505
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,250
This does not seem safe.

506
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,550
There's... there's just...

507
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,370
Oh!

508
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,130
Oh my god!

509
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,670
Hello?

510
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,690
An old safe lies discarded on the nearby ledge!

511
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,950
Uh, mine?

512
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,450
Thank you.

513
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,610
Yeah, Osha...

514
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,530
Osha needs to get in here stat.

515
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,130
This place is about to...

516
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,550
This place is about to crumble!

517
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,330
I want to talk to them.

518
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,150
That's what I'm trying to do.

519
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,270
I guess I can't.

520
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,150
I can only examine the area.

521
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,930
The structure around here shows signs of stress.

522
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,630
It is far from sound.

523
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,350
Perhaps with some reinforcement, it might be able to suit the requirements of the monument.

524
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,370
Oh, whoa!

525
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,510
What does that mean?

526
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,510
I'm Osha.

527
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,070
For real!

528
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,690
Huh?

529
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,790
Is that it?

530
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,170
I surveyed the area.

531
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,310
Now do your jobs, everybody.

532
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,370
Oh, wait!

533
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,210
Did it...

534
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,810
Were these...

535
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,390
These panels were here before, right?

536
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,490
Do I continue?

537
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,010
Climb down.

538
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,830
How many places are there?

539
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,630
This is our map.

540
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,330
Oh, okay, okay.

541
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,570
What does the X mean?

542
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,510
Huh?

543
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,200
What does the X mean?

544
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,900
Hmm.

545
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,160
Cooper, thanks for the gift!

546
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,320
I've been there.

547
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,560
Treasure.

548
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,660
I guess it's fine now.

549
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,660
I don't hear any crumbles.

550
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,500
So, let's go.

551
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,020
Oh!

552
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,380
Oh!

553
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,780
Uh...

554
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,460
Hmm...

555
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,220
We have red guys on the right.

556
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Blue guys on the left.

557
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,780
I don't think I missed the first one.

558
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,540
But I can...

559
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,780
Oh, oh!

560
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
Oh, no!

561
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,180
Oh, they're all gonna come to life as soon as I pull the lever!

562
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,440
Oh, no!

563
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,940
There's so many guys in here!

564
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,100
There's so many in here!

565
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,500
I think I have to put on my sword.

566
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,220
I can't...

567
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,560
I can't use my torch.

568
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,520
Oh, it's dark, though.

569
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,420
It's a trap.

570
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,520
It feels like a trap, huh?

571
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,280
It's a trap.

572
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280
It feels like a trap, huh?

573
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,290
What's a...

574
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,370
Okay, what's my quick...

575
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,090
My quick spells again?

576
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:14,990
Sorry, I have to check.

577
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,330
Where is my spell book?

578
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,590
Oh, we don't have it yet!

579
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,910
I can't even do any spells!

580
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,770
Oh my gosh, I forgot I can't do spells.

581
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,890
Oh my gosh, I forgot I can't do spells.

582
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,150
Cinema!

583
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,510
Cinema!

584
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,480
Um...

585
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,800
Maybe I'll come back.

586
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,240
Okay, so we did this area.

587
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,860
There was...

588
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,640
Did I need to survey the other place?

589
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,540
Hold on.

590
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,940
Give me a second, guys.

591
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm gonna go check stuff out real quick.

592
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,320
Hold on.

593
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,120
I missed my torch.

594
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm guessing I don't need this yet.

595
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,880
Oh my gosh.

596
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,700
Oh, wait!

597
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,740
What's this?

598
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,320
Wait, is this where I came from?

599
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
Or is this where I came from?

600
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,460
Wait a second.

601
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,520
Uh...

602
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,980
There's a hidden...

603
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,540
Okay.

604
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,180
Okay.

605
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Just kidding.

606
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,020
So I don't need to survey this room.

607
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,660
It doesn't give me the option to.

608
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,250
What is... What room?

609
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,690
Huh?

610
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,870
I've only been to like two places!

611
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,030
How are these rooms already shown that I've gone in them?

612
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,290
Right?

613
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,750
Or maybe not.

614
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,310
I don't know.

615
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,990
Is there anything else in here that we missed?

616
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,230
It was a really tiny room.

617
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,390
Wait, what's that?

618
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,530
Oh, nope.

619
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:01,930
Okay.

620
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,770
Alright, I guess I gotta go pull the lever.

621
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,930
There's like nothing else to do.

622
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,360
Well, yeah.

623
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,400
Welcome to membership.

624
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,980
Thank you!

625
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,120
This place is the most confusing place.

626
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,640
I am confused.

627
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,280
And I'm only like two rooms in.

628
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,620
Climb up.

629
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,280
Let's go pull the lever.

630
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,300
I guess.

631
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm scared.

632
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,860
I know it's gonna go wrong.

633
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,980
It's gonna go so wrong.

634
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,880
Maybe I'll save right here.

635
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,080
Wait.

636
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Oh, it's not...

637
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,920
Oh, okay.

638
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,220
Hold on.

639
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,380
I gotta go back up and save.

640
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,000
Save and continue.

641
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,520
Alrighty.

642
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,180
Climb down.

643
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,470
Okie dokie.

644
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,230
Maybe I'll go for the guys with my torch first.

645
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,250
The lever is situated near the gate.

646
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,650
Should Roberto pull the lever?

647
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,590
Yeah, I guess so.

648
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,190
Oh, only one opened up.

649
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,730
Equip my sword!

650
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,830
Yeah, take that!

651
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,350
And that!

652
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,610
Finish him!

653
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,330
Oh, I wanna get my sanity low.

654
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,050
We want my sanity to be low, guys.

655
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,910
Low, low, low.

656
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,050
So I'll try not to finish the guys too much.

657
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,690
Oh, okay.

658
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,250
Pull the lever.

659
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,570
Sometimes I just wanna finish them so that they don't wake back up though, you know?

660
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,410
Oh, so the game is a little bit nice.

661
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,070
They give you the...

662
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,370
They don't do it all at once.

663
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:05,610
Okay.

664
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,310
And...

665
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:08,930
And...

666
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:09,950
Ow!

667
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,470
Shit!

668
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,030
Oh my gosh.

669
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:15,730
Oh!

670
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,290
Oh!

671
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,130
Oh my gosh.

672
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,070
Aren't you regenerative?

673
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,330
Regenerative?

674
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,650
Oh, the girls are fighting?

675
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,070
Oh!

676
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,950
His head!

677
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,630
No!

678
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,990
No, no, no!

679
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,350
Die!

680
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,710
Die, die!

681
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,710
Die, die!

682
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,270
Die, die, die, die!

683
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,790
Yeah!

684
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,450
And he'll die on the ground.

685
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,530
Like the sad little guy.

686
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:41,970
Ah!

687
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,430
You only have one arm.

688
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,320
So they're not gonna get back up, right?

689
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:49,760
Ah!

690
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
Oh, he's not getting back up.

691
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,360
Is he?

692
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,520
He's not gonna get back up, right?

693
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,620
Because they're basically dead.

694
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,260
This is our test.

695
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,640
This is our... this is to see.

696
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,160
Ah!

697
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,060
They get back up!

698
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,900
I have to finish them!

699
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,180
I have to finish them!

700
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,340
Hahaha!

701
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:14,960
Hahaha!

702
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,380
Okay.

703
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,800
I learned my lesson.

704
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,860
You guys, we did a science experiment.

705
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,280
Just then.

706
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,520
Isn't the power of science so awesome?

707
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,400
We had a hypothesis.

708
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,900
Skellies will not get back up when you say finish them.

709
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,320
And then we did a test.

710
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,920
The scientific method.

711
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,140
Science rules.

712
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,120
So for the red zombies, I gotta finish them.

713
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:41,960
I think.

714
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,760
Oh!

715
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,260
Pull the lever!

716
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,040
And then these bozos...

717
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,240
I can just...

718
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,720
I can just take them down with my...

719
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,260
Are you gonna wake up?

720
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,500
Are you gonna get up?

721
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,580
Come here, normal guys.

722
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,540
Normal!

723
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:06,980
Guys!

724
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,900
I love you guys!

725
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,020
Yay!

726
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,160
Oh my gosh!

727
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,760
Look at them flailing on the ground!

728
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,240
Yeah!

729
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,060
Power of fire!

730
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,440
I love not being a caveman.

731
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,140
Konami sale on Steam right now.

732
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,380
Just picked up the entire Metal Gear series.

733
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,760
Oh, let's go!

734
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,300
I didn't know that there was a sale.

735
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,020
I saw it earlier too.

736
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,080
I appreciate Minto saying hypothesis not theory.

737
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,220
Yeah.

738
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,120
Oh my gosh.

739
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,460
This place is not safe.

740
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,260
There's just little rocks.

741
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,900
What am I picking up?

742
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,640
Oh!

743
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,360
The sacred crossbow bolts.

744
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,380
Why else would they be on this pedestal?

745
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,700
Not safe for work?

746
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,460
Yeah!

747
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,780
The work is not safe?

748
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,960
The place is not safe?

749
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,460
Nothing is safe.

750
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,320
This chapter irks me.

751
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,960
There's a statue that's easy to miss because it's hidden in the most unremarkable spot.

752
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,760
Granted, it's optional.

753
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,080
Only makes the final boss a little easier.

754
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh!

755
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,160
You guys can backseat me for that if you want.

756
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,120
We got a crossbow!

757
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,700
Are you guys doing your jobs?

758
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,800
Huh?

759
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,780
This place?

760
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,620
Talk to him.

761
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,480
Come here, come here, come here.

762
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,280
The man babbles incoherently about worms devouring his countrymen.

763
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,420
And that Roberto will be next!

764
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,440
Oh my god.

765
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,160
The worms.

766
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,800
The worms.

767
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,260
No wonder this place is not sound.

768
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,660
The guys are talking incoherently.

769
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,000
The man babbles about worms.

770
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,540
Everybody's talking about the worms!

771
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,520
Man, I feel left out.

772
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,360
I don't know anything about the worms.

773
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:51,960
Hahaha.

774
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,700
Won't someone tell me about the worms?

775
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,320
The worms!

776
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,780
The worms!

777
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,120
Me too!

778
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,120
Worms!

779
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
Let's survey the area.

780
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
Dust and rock falls from the roof.

781
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,180
The worms got my family.

782
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,420
He's not lying.

783
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,440
No!

784
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,620
Dust and rock falls from the roof through a fault in the stone.

785
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,800
It is difficult for Roberto to assess how sturdy the place is.

786
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,960
But it needs a lot of reinforcement if it is to be built upon.

787
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,080
I guess that's it.

788
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,100
How many places am I surveying?

789
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,840
That's all that it needed?

790
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,160
Why don't we build actual pillars to hold up the ceiling?

791
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,000
You know, pillars are not just to look cool.

792
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,040
They have a purpose.

793
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,820
Four rooms?

794
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,020
Okay.

795
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,880
We've done two so far.

796
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,500
We're killing it.

797
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,920
Oh no.

798
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh man!

799
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,900
This ladder leads down to the to the tome of eternal darkness!

800
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,380
Oh no!

801
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,480
Oh man!

802
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
We should have known!

803
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,730
Oh god.

804
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,950
It's going to get really loud, you guys.

805
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,750
Would you still love me if I were a worm devouring your country?

806
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,270
Yes!

807
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,390
Yearns to be claimed!

808
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,610
Okay, it's mine now.

809
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,650
That was weird.

810
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,650
Now we can cast spells.

811
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,270
Okay, now I can see what my quick spells are.

812
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,110
Okay, so...

813
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,050
Recover...

814
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,770
is Y.

815
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,010
Right is enchant.

816
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,370
item.

817
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,410
Purple.

818
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,070
I should probably have enchant item the other colors though, right?

819
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,370
Yeah, now he suddenly knows magic.

820
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,630
Do you think you'd pick up the tome of eternal darkness if you experienced that IRL?

821
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,790
Looks kinda cool to look at.

822
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,770
How do you get out otherwise?

823
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,350
How do you leave the room?

824
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,030
That doesn't seem like...

825
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,090
I think getting the tome of eternal darkness is your only option to leave.

826
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,530
You change the floors while looking at the map to see the survey rooms and how the rooms connect to this place.

827
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,650
Like... wait.

828
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:50,990
Hold on.

829
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,190
Gamecube controls I don't know so well.

830
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,350
How do I switch through the...

831
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,760
Y button is up a floor.

832
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,640
I guess we're at the very top.

833
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,520
Oh, Z.

834
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,720
Sorry, not Z, X.

835
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,120
Oh!

836
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,280
Those two!

837
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,840
And then there's a middle room at the bottom.

838
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,340
Oh, wait!

839
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,880
There's another room to be surveyed at the very bottom.

840
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,500
Thank you for the rate!

841
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,880
Oh, spectra!

842
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,740
Thank you for the rate, sorry.

843
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,020
It's white on white.

844
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
So I can't even read the name sometimes.

845
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,280
Thank you so much!

846
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,240
Thanks for the rate.

847
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,360
We're like part four of this...

848
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,380
of this wacky game.

849
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,960
If you don't know what's going on, neither do I.

850
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,300
But right now we have to go through a bunch of floors and survey them.

851
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,960
And we have two here, and then one in the very, very basement.

852
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,260
Amelia!

853
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,240
Thanks for the five gifted.

854
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,700
Thank you!

855
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,840
Let's go down.

856
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,880
Oh my god.

857
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,640
Oh my god.

858
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,280
I got you.

859
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,980
Oh, shoot.

860
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,400
Wait, I wish I could change my camera angle.

861
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,840
It's these things.

862
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,120
Don't worry, I'll save you.

863
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,780
Um...

864
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,540
Maybe I can switch to my crossbow.

865
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,540
I only...

866
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,560
Wait, no, I have...

867
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,980
You think that'll do it?

868
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,140
I killed something.

869
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:17,960
Ducky!

870
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,740
Thanks for the gifted!

871
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,560
Oh, reload?

872
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,400
It's okay, guy.

873
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,260
I got him.

874
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,580
I am God Gamer.

875
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,110
I don't think there's anything else.

876
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:35,990
Let's go.

877
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,830
You're safe.

878
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,630
You're safe.

879
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,890
The worker is surprised to see Roberto.

880
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,130
He confesses to cowardice as he stayed behind while others ventured further into the complex.

881
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,930
When the screams of the others echoed from the walls, he dared not move.

882
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,370
It's okay, little baby coward baby.

883
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,070
Oh.

884
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:57,570
Oh my god.

885
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,490
I heard something else.

886
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:58,830
Sorry.

887
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,940
Now I think we're good.

888
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,720
Oh my gosh, there was something there!

889
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,740
I didn't hear it, though.

890
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,020
Okay.

891
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,280
You're safe, probably.

892
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
You might wanna go upstairs.

893
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,360
Unless you wanna... He's probably so sick of the worm people.

894
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,210
La la la.

895
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,870
He's like, enough of these worm guys.

896
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,030
A collapsed roof and scaffolding prevents Roberto from proceeding further down this corridor.

897
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,190
Noooo!

898
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,810
It's just making it more difficult on us, isn't it?

899
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,050
Well, we can at least go up this way.

900
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,650
Oh!

901
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,110
This is not a good place.

902
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,810
Okay, maybe...

903
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,470
This is gas that's gonna kill me, isn't it?

904
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,310
Isn't this poison gas?

905
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,230
Is it killing me?

906
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,630
Wait, that guy... what is that in the bottom corner?

907
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,590
I didn't even move!

908
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,230
The phone hurting, guys.

909
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,450
It was him!

910
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,310
He did a little swipe motion and they noticed me!

911
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:27,750
Messed up!

912
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,290
Okay.

913
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,690
I don't know if that one zombie on the right or left...

914
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,190
Roberto's right.

915
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,550
Screen left.

916
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,130
I don't know if that thing can be burned with a torch.

917
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,030
I guess we'll try.

918
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,940
Oh my gosh!

919
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,760
Oh, it's this thing!

920
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
Oh my god, it's this thing.

921
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,640
I forgot.

922
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,740
Oh, shoot.

923
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,100
Okay.

924
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,380
Equip.

925
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,880
Finish him!

926
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,020
Yeah, yeah.

927
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,780
Okay, and then this guy...

928
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,420
Ah!

929
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,520
Ah, shoot!

930
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,200
No, I'm trying to move!

931
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,800
No!

932
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,040
He's really draining me.

933
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
He's really draining me.

934
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,820
Open up!

935
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,080
Reload?

936
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

937
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,740
Reload?

938
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,740
For real?

939
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,580
Don't let him do it.

940
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,140
Yeah.

941
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,860
I wanna... I wanna maybe use this instead.

942
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,740
What's that in the middle?

943
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,260
Oh, I'm not close enough!

944
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,460
Oh.

945
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:46,920
Ah!

946
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,740
Shit!

947
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,240
Ah!

948
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,580
Don't forget to enchant your weapon.

949
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,380
Oh, you're right!

950
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,620
What did he just summon?

951
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,960
Of course he didn't.

952
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,840
A little... I don't remember how to change...

953
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,560
I don't remember how to change targets.

954
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,640
I know that was a thing.

955
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,400
I only have three things left.

956
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,260
Mmm...

957
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,980
Okay, we're gonna have to, like, get really close for him.

958
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,680
Oh!

959
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,980
My sanity!

960
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,580
Not another one?

961
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh no, it's time to start crying!

962
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,200
Oh, there's babies crying!

963
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,880
I don't want it to get too low, and then I can't even...

964
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,080
Do you think I can get him now?

965
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,080
Oh, shoot.

966
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,400
This guy takes... this guy packs heat.

967
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:54,760
Oh!

968
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,980
Oh my god, that's not what I meant to do.

969
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,780
I was reloading, and...

970
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,900
Uh, go back up, buddy.

971
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,120
We're not done here.

972
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,400
We're not done here.

973
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:05,900
Okay?

974
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:14,930
I don't... it's sad to be on your high school.

975
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:15,710
What's he saying?

976
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,130
Make a test of me.

977
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,870
What's, um...

978
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,570
So, if he's green, I should do... I should do red, right?

979
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,930
I should, um, enchant... red, right?

980
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,250
He is green, right?

981
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,430
On my crossbow.

982
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,210
I can't hit him with the sword.

983
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,450
It sucks.

984
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,450
Very cool.

985
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,070
Alright.

986
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,950
Open up!

987
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,930
Do I have any left?

988
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,290
Oh, shit.

989
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,150
Open up!

990
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,350
Uh oh.

991
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:03,510
Guys?

992
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,010
I think that was my last one.

993
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,550
We're gonna enchant this one too.

994
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,170
And ironically, the best way to do Roberto's chapter is to just juke and run.

995
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,930
His weapons are bad and he is very slow.

996
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:15,870
Really?

997
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,730
Oh, should I just go then?

998
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,060
Um...

999
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,660
I was gonna... there we go.

1000
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,880
I don't even know if we can enchant it.

1001
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,500
Enjoy.

1002
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,040
Enjoy.

1003
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,800
I feel like this is a sunk cost.

1004
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,480
I need to at least kill this guy.

1005
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,020
What the heck?

1006
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,400
No!

1007
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,220
How do I get this guy?

1008
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Didn't even connect.

1009
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,940
I know, it sucks so bad.

1010
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,680
This sucks so bad!

1011
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,180
Oh my god.

1012
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,060
I'm scared.

1013
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,320
What is here?

1014
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,900
It's not this way, is it?

1015
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,060
Okay.

1016
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,440
Oh yes, the thing in the middle!

1017
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,800
Thank you.

1018
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,940
A tattered scroll of paper sits atop the dives, collecting dust.

1019
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,760
So...

1020
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,400
The main zombie!

1021
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,300
No, no.

1022
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,160
Stay away, please.

1023
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,160
They noticed me.

1024
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,300
My sanity is so done.

1025
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,060
My sanity is so bad right now.

1026
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,500
Just run.

1027
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,400
Just run, Roberto.

1028
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,300
Run, Roberto.

1029
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,780
I think we're in trouble.

1030
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,910
So I go this way?

1031
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,030
Whatever is in here is going to eat me alive.

1032
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,270
Oh my god!

1033
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,930
A worker's corpse lies amidst a pile of rubble.

1034
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,890
The man's body has been pulverized by being thrown against the wall with such ferocity that it had collapsed.

1035
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,850
So this thing is ruining our monument.

1036
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,070
So this thing is ruining our monument.

1037
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:52,770
Wait, how am I...

1038
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,290
Oh my gosh.

1039
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,190
Oh my gosh.

1040
00:47:54,430 --> 00:48:00,550
We need to enchant it.

1041
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,870
Red, so I should do blue.

1042
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,420
I'm gonna die.

1043
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,400
I'm gonna die for real.

1044
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,800
Just kill him!

1045
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,480
Just run, Roberto!

1046
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:20,780
Roberto.

1047
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,360
Roberto.

1048
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,280
That's a wall.

1049
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,460
Roberto, over here.

1050
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,700
Roberto.

1051
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,420
Guys, I think we're cooked.

1052
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,520
I think we're so cooked.

1053
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,460
Roberto!

1054
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,440
Roberto, please, just move.

1055
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,280
I'm just gonna let him kill me.

1056
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,460
I'm just gonna go to the next...

1057
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:40,780
Don't!

1058
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,500
Just do a thing!

1059
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,140
Try your best, Roberto!

1060
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,480
He swings!

1061
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,120
And he misses!

1062
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,760
Okay, at least now...

1063
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,140
We will have our crossbows.

1064
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,960
If you must fight tough monsters, you'll want the Antarok Red...

1065
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,940
Red Gormor spell.

1066
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,980
The magic attack one.

1067
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
Just watch Roberto's magic since he has so little.

1068
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,640
Oh, this one.

1069
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,640
This is...

1070
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,040
Roberto!

1071
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,320
Roberto, I'm trying to be...

1072
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm trying to be your...

1073
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,600
Your hype man, but...

1074
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,960
You make it difficult.

1075
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,620
Oh, the shield spell.

1076
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,180
Okay.

1077
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,120
Yeah, I do have to remember, like, the kind of spells that I have here.

1078
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,440
Alright, so we're loading.

1079
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,000
Alright, I know we're a little...

1080
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,220
I loaded, like, a little ways away.

1081
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,060
That's okay, though.

1082
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,060
Before the...

1083
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,760
What's it called?

1084
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,040
Room.

1085
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,600
Before the...

1086
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,000
The gas room, we shall...

1087
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,520
Wait, where am I?

1088
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,260
Oh, shoot!

1089
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,040
I'm this far away?

1090
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,980
Okay, never mind.

1091
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,120
Damn, I thought I had saved sooner.

1092
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,120
Okay, my bad.

1093
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,920
My bad, guys.

1094
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,380
In fact, let's just...

1095
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,240
Where's... Oh, we don't have the...

1096
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,620
We don't even have the tome yet!

1097
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,060
Yikes.

1098
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,440
Okay.

1099
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,950
So, blue first.

1100
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:16,890
Come here.

1101
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,710
Yeah!

1102
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:23,930
Yeah!

1103
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,830
And... finish him.

1104
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,250
The weakest chapter of the game.

1105
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:30,770
Also, a reminder.

1106
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,090
If you run out of sanity and monsters seize you, you take...

1107
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,510
Yeah, I know.

1108
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,230
That's why I'm, like, trying not to make my sanity so low.

1109
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,470
I might have to, like...

1110
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,290
I want to do the sanity effects, you know?

1111
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:39,810
Because they're fun.

1112
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,590
But I might have to refrain this chapter if he's...

1113
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,370
If he's this weak.

1114
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,770
If he's, like, so weak, you know?

1115
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,050
If he's a weak, slow guy...

1116
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,130
It's not your fault, Roberto.

1117
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,790
I mean, it is.

1118
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,150
It is your fault.

1119
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:55,710
A little bit.

1120
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:56,450
But, you know.

1121
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:57,450
Oh my gosh.

1122
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,610
The girls are fighting?

1123
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,790
Yeah!

1124
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,570
Oh!

1125
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,150
His head!

1126
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:12,950
Oh!

1127
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,350
No!

1128
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:13,750
Their heads!

1129
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,250
Can I get you?

1130
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,450
There we go.

1131
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,550
Finish him!

1132
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,490
Finish him!

1133
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:35,530
Get them to open their cloak, then run behind them and smack them.

1134
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:36,190
Oh!

1135
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,530
That works.

1136
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,140
And...

1137
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,800
Get our torch.

1138
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,120
Easy peasy.

1139
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,720
Pull the lever!

1140
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,220
Crunk!

1141
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,480
Oh!

1142
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,220
That lever!

1143
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,740
Crunk!

1144
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,500
Alright.

1145
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,700
Alright, wake up!

1146
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,800
Wakey wakey!

1147
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,080
Yay!

1148
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:06,990
Flail!

1149
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,210
Die on the ground!

1150
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,850
I might just grab the thing in the middle, then.

1151
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,090
The spell?

1152
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,390
The codec in the middle?

1153
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:17,370
Codex?

1154
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,150
And then...

1155
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,270
Um...

1156
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:21,930
Ignore the guy.

1157
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,470
Okay.

1158
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:27,850
Let's go.

1159
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:29,530
Climb up.

1160
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:30,610
Yeah.

1161
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,250
It's true horror game.

1162
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,370
Survival horror game strats.

1163
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,970
Don't kill everything that you see.

1164
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,790
You don't need to kill everything that you see.

1165
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,730
The real survival horror game strats.

1166
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,270
Okay, nice.

1167
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,970
I don't think I can torch him.

1168
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,430
I think only normal zombies can get torched.

1169
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,970
Survey this area!

1170
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:55,630
Yes!

1171
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,650
You are not Doomguy.

1172
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,410
I am Roberto.

1173
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,750
Guys, I'm just Roberto, okay?

1174
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,670
Okay, so there's...

1175
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,470
Oh, that's right.

1176
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,190
We get the tome first.

1177
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,910
Alright, work those legs, buddy!

1178
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,170
Alright, open up!

1179
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:12,750
Open up!

1180
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,220
Alright.

1181
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,340
Sniped.

1182
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,940
Roberto is like a killer sniper, though.

1183
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,840
Santo Pichi.

1184
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,460
Santo Pichi.

1185
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,540
Wait, did I get it?

1186
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,920
Roberto, I just complimented you and I think you missed...

1187
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,620
Roberto!

1188
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,560
Roberto!

1189
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,840
Spell 9 instead of a crossbow.

1190
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,680
Oh, like summon?

1191
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,300
Spell 9 is summon our zombie and then we kill the zombie with the fire.

1192
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,440
Mmmm...

1193
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,400
What's the difference?

1194
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:15,840
Hold on.

1195
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,360
Question.

1196
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,860
What if I summon him 3 star versus 5 star?

1197
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,700
What's the difference?

1198
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,860
Wait, I thought spell 9 was a zombie.

1199
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,840
Is it spell 8 then?

1200
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,000
How did I learn this?

1201
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,020
It's so hard when I don't have the codex.

1202
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Spell 9 is a magic attack which you will need for a later chapter.

1203
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,620
Oh my gosh.

1204
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,680
It's actually seemingly overwhelming how much you can do in this game.

1205
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,860
I know.

1206
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,620
There's so much.

1207
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,360
Yeah, chat is codex.

1208
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,400
I truly would even be able to play this game without you guys.

1209
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,540
Okay, I'm going to... maybe I will summon this guy then.

1210
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,360
Alright, we're going to summon a little zombie.

1211
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,760
Oh my

1212
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,700
gosh.

1213
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,960
Scared me.

1214
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,820
Came up on me.

1215
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,480
Yeah, this game truly hates Roberto.

1216
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,940
Where is it?

1217
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,700
No wonder I couldn't get it.

1218
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,480
It's like way down there.

1219
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,750
Okay.

1220
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,910
Okay.

1221
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,910
We're fine, everybody.

1222
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,590
Do not even fret.

1223
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,690
You okay, man?

1224
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:28,310
You okay?

1225
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,290
I saved you.

1226
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:30,870
I saved you.

1227
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:31,050
I saved you.

1228
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,410
I saved you.

1229
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,490
He's so ungrateful.

1230
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,040
Alright.

1231
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,640
Let's save here.

1232
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,900
Let's save.

1233
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,020
This looks like almost something I can pick up.

1234
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,330
Save and get the new.

1235
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,170
Okay, cool.

1236
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,510
Cannot save him from being a coward.

1237
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:02,970
I know.

1238
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:05,250
Alright, and let's take out this guy.

1239
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,130
And let's get the thing in the middle.

1240
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,790
Yeah.

1241
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:13,770
Pick up.

1242
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,330
And let's leave.

1243
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,330
Bye-bye.

1244
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,620
Now, this thing...

1245
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,140
I don't know what to do with this guy.

1246
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,780
Guys, I'm not sure.

1247
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,820
I don't know what to do.

1248
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,280
I'm so...

1249
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,680
I don't know how to defeat this guy.

1250
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Just run?

1251
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,860
But it's too narrow.

1252
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,100
I can't get around him.

1253
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,480
Blue crossbow to the face.

1254
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,380
Yeah.

1255
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,480
Let's try that.

1256
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,220
Enchant.

1257
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,380
I'm gonna do five on my crossbow.

1258
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,810
Oh, this camera angle is diabolical.

1259
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:25,690
Absolutely.

1260
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,060
Oh, I see him.

1261
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,800
Oh

1262
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,930
my god.

1263
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,680
Oh my god.

1264
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,250
Oh.

1265
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,610
No, no, no.

1266
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:51,970
No!

1267
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:53,870
Roberto!

1268
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,750
You must live!

1269
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:57,930
What the?

1270
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:58,650
Reload?

1271
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,070
Please.

1272
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,420
Roberto.

1273
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,540
You did it though.

1274
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,460
Maybe that...

1275
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:11,720
Oh.

1276
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,140
Oh.

1277
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,220
Oh.

1278
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:17,720
Oh.

1279
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,480
Where's my shield?

1280
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:19,860
Okay.

1281
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,020
Cast.

1282
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,600
But this one is...

1283
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,540
is same, right?

1284
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,960
So, it's... I cast a red shield against red attacks, right?

1285
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,900
There's a certain spot in the hallway where you can get around him.

1286
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,620
It's by a ladder.

1287
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,460
Also do a five point red shield and slide past him.

1288
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,740
If he doesn't attack me, pass!

1289
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,880
Oh my god.

1290
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,460
Did it work?

1291
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,140
Can you... Excuse me.

1292
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:53,740
Go!

1293
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,180
Roberto!

1294
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,200
Roberto.

1295
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,900
This is not the time to be out of stamina.

1296
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,560
Roberto low.

1297
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,320
Go, Roberto!

1298
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,040
Open the door!

1299
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,680
Oh my god.

1300
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,370
Does that mean I can save?

1301
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:19,650
Hell.

1302
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:19,970
Hell yeah.

1303
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:22,630
Splat.

1304
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:25,830
Oh my gosh.

1305
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,550
Roberto.

1306
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,730
Just gonna reload.

1307
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,050
And...

1308
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,110
Um...

1309
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,290
I'm just gonna equip my torch.

1310
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,550
And... What's my stats?

1311
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:38,930
Uh... Yeah!

1312
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,890
I'll use this.

1313
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,700
Nice.

1314
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,100
So this...

1315
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,380
Oh my gosh.

1316
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,040
All my friends!

1317
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,640
Ravaged corpses litter the room.

1318
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,920
Their flesh has been devoured in places.

1319
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,440
What?

1320
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,060
In places!

1321
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,980
And decomposition is already set in?

1322
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,200
How long have these guys been dead for?

1323
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,440
They've been devoured in...

1324
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,720
Who knows where?

1325
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,960
Oh my gosh.

1326
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,280
Okay.

1327
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:12,860
So...

1328
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,560
There's a door.

1329
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,280
I see that.

1330
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,800
Um...

1331
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,700
Don't go in there.

1332
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,040
Go in here.

1333
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,240
What the?

1334
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:24,740
What the?

1335
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,400
You guys don't like my torch?

1336
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,460
You guys don't like my torch?

1337
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,820
Is my torch not strong enough for you?

1338
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,240
Oh...

1339
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,400
Wait.

1340
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:37,980
Wait.

1341
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:38,960
Are they blue?

1342
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,300
Are these blue guys?

1343
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,280
Are you blue?

1344
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,060
Da ba dee da ba da...

1345
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,840
Da ba dee...

1346
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,200
Oh...

1347
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,660
The tiny guy.

1348
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,000
Go away, please.

1349
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,860
I'm scared of the big guy.

1350
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,520
Yeah.

1351
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,180
Take him out.

1352
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:58,660
Finish him.

1353
01:01:59,420 --> 01:01:59,960
Oh my gosh.

1354
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:00,980
Actually do it, Roberto.

1355
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:01,380
Run.

1356
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:01,780
Now run.

1357
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:02,580
Yeah.

1358
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,160
Good job, Roberto!

1359
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,420
You're killing it, man.

1360
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,040
You're killing it.

1361
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,020
Like literally.

1362
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,940
You're actually... Wait.

1363
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,660
What is it doing?

1364
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:14,860
I don't like that.

1365
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,200
Wait.

1366
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,180
Oh!

1367
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,080
Oh!

1368
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,940
These guys explode!

1369
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,780
That's right!

1370
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,740
This guy is just standing here.

1371
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,760
He doesn't know what to do.

1372
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,240
I forgot these ones explode.

1373
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,140
It's all good.

1374
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,260
Roberto is a pro.

1375
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,220
If Roberto has zero fans, I am dead.

1376
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,320
Oh, wait.

1377
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,680
He's just...

1378
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,680
Sorry.

1379
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,480
I'm going to totally, absolutely save scum in this chapter.

1380
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,020
I don't know.

1381
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,180
This chapter freaks me out.

1382
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,400
Where are we anyway?

1383
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,920
Oh, we're so close to the...

1384
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,420
So if I go...

1385
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,940
down here?

1386
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,060
No.

1387
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,740
In here?

1388
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,820
This is a room that needs to be surveyed?

1389
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:13,960
Uh-oh.

1390
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,660
The walls are bleeding.

1391
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:19,620
Yes.

1392
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,540
I hear the...

1393
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,220
I hear the room being bad.

1394
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,180
Oh, hello worker!

1395
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,620
You guys are safe?

1396
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,740
You are...

1397
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:39,620
You are dealing with all those bogeys with just a torch, sword, and crossbow?

1398
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,300
Whoa, mama, you're pretty good.

1399
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,930
Is this guy okay?

1400
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,110
These guys I can't talk to.

1401
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,770
It's so sad.

1402
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,250
They don't care about the worms.

1403
01:03:59,370 --> 01:03:59,690
You guys!

1404
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,390
You have to know about the worms!

1405
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,270
They're eating the countrymen!

1406
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:04,710
They're eating...

1407
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,210
They're eating your families, the worms!

1408
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,710
Roberto tried to survey this area.

1409
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,010
Yes.

1410
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:21,830
Although crumbling in places and also have walls of dripping blood, the structure of this area could be braced to provide enough of a foundation for the monument.

1411
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,040
What the?

1412
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,180
Oh my god!

1413
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,800
Is that my sanity?

1414
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,340
Or are they actually trying to kill... No, my sanity is high.

1415
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,460
The worms!

1416
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,340
No, I shouldn't... I shouldn't kill them.

1417
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:50,960
I shouldn't kill them!

1418
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,200
Probably.

1419
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,800
The worms!

1420
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,320
The worms!

1421
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:00,880
The worms!

1422
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,320
Yeah, I was so shocked that they were fine.

1423
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,940
But they weren't.

1424
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,440
They got wormed.

1425
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,900
Let's check out... Oh, never mind.

1426
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,160
This door is locked.

1427
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:12,940
Alright then.

1428
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,960
I am going to save because I don't want to deal with those guys again.

1429
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,120
I don't want to go back in there.

1430
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,340
I don't want to look at them or think about them.

1431
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,180
I'm done with worms.

1432
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,660
I'm done with worms.

1433
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,280
Oh, damn it!

1434
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,060
Sorry.

1435
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,760
It was so close.

1436
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,420
Well, I'll reload here, I guess.

1437
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,840
Is there another one?

1438
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,400
Why...

1439
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,040
The camera...

1440
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,480
was fine before and now decides not to be fine.

1441
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,140
Okay.

1442
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,400
Oh, no.

1443
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,900
Stones and rubble from the collapsed ceiling prevent any passage in that direction.

1444
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,340
Have we been here?

1445
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,380
Use reveal invisible here.

1446
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,460
Forgot what color though.

1447
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,580
At this door?

1448
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,370
It's the end of the Pius Chapter.

1449
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:35,750
Yes!

1450
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:36,990
I thought so!

1451
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,930
I recognized for some reason.

1452
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,450
I recognized this spot.

1453
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,310
Of all places.

1454
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,510
This is where Pius was!

1455
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:45,870
Yes!

1456
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,230
The missable statue is in an alcove in the wall somewhere on this floor.

1457
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:51,090
I remember right.

1458
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,810
Just pay attention to the walls as you explore.

1459
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:53,510
Oh my goodness!

1460
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,410
Thank you guys!

1461
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,470
And sorry if some people...

1462
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,850
Or rather, if some people think this is like backseating, it's totally...

1463
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,130
fine.

1464
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,290
I'm not even...

1465
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:06,190
Oh, I should probably learn the five star...

1466
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,190
Or the five...

1467
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,490
Yeah, point, right?

1468
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:11,790
So, um...

1469
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,290
Oh, what was it?

1470
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:14,970
Hold on, let me check.

1471
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:17,590
Uh...

1472
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,430
Check...

1473
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:22,730
Narakoth...

1474
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,510
Red Gormor...

1475
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:28,690
Uh...

1476
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:29,270
What color?

1477
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,350
What color should we do?

1478
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,930
Purple?

1479
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,390
Red?

1480
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,030
Oh, I guess it doesn't matter.

1481
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,810
Um, Narakoth...

1482
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,880
Red Gormor...

1483
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,740
And Parkon?

1484
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,420
Parkon.

1485
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,600
Oh, the purple one makes you invisible.

1486
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,440
So now...

1487
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,280
Spell list...

1488
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,280
Cast...

1489
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,900
I'm gonna...

1490
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,580
I'm gonna...

1491
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,620
If he hollers at him, go...

1492
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,920
My mom said to pick the very best color and you are it.

1493
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,200
My mom said to pick the very best color and you are it.

1494
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,180
No.

1495
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,770
I'm the real one.

1496
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,010
Oh...

1497
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,910
I'm in the right spot, right?

1498
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,560
I'm in the right spot, right?

1499
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,760
I'm in the right spot, right?

1500
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,820
Oh, turn around?

1501
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,700
Why did you guys stop me?

1502
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,140
Look for a little alcove.

1503
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,420
This?

1504
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,340
This?

1505
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,580
Green!

1506
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,760
Maybe it was red.

1507
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,850
I was right the first time.

1508
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,950
I was right the first time!

1509
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:26,970
Sad, man.

1510
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:30,830
Why the alcove set into the wall.

1511
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,550
I can see...

1512
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,030
I can see why this little alcove would be suspicious.

1513
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:41,850
Because even walking over here, I was just like, oh this is like brightly lit.

1514
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,970
And has nothing here.

1515
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,310
So I get it.

1516
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,510
How are you supposed to know that?

1517
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,410
But I also am like, that's kind of BS.

1518
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:57,610
I walked around to get my magic back up.

1519
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,070
Did we even continue?

1520
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,110
Awesome.

1521
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:04,290
I'm gonna go in with my...

1522
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,630
Oh my gosh.

1523
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,790
A small statuette of a sorcerer driven mad by an unseen force.

1524
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,010
It is made from a lustrous sapphire.

1525
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:18,570
You can either cast reveal invisible, or if you clear the next room and double back, it is automatically revealed.

1526
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,010
Gosh, you guys know so much about this game.

1527
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:22,290
Oops.

1528
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,010
I love the jingles.

1529
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:28,590
These jingles are pretty fun.

1530
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,170
You know that because you need to reveal right in the next room.

1531
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,110
I see those feet.

1532
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:40,930
Wait a second.

1533
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:41,670
Leave.

1534
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,770
Oh, I can't leave.

1535
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,290
Wait.

1536
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,010
Wait.

1537
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,370
Wait.

1538
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:48,410
Shield.

1539
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:49,450
For something.

1540
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:49,930
Shield.

1541
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:50,650
Shield.

1542
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:51,770
Shield.

1543
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,410
Where's my shield?

1544
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,680
Why is this camera angle?

1545
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,520
I can't see anything.

1546
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,660
I'm scared.

1547
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,580
Oh my gosh.

1548
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,290
There's a key.

1549
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:14,170
Oh my god.

1550
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,570
What is this?

1551
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,290
No!

1552
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,950
Leave me alone.

1553
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,990
Okay.

1554
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:25,630
Okay.

1555
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:25,790
Okay.

1556
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,210
It killed the other guys.

1557
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:31,370
Oh my gosh.

1558
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,890
I almost ran into that.

1559
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,610
Don't run out of... Roberto, please.

1560
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,370
Roberto, run.

1561
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,370
Roberto, run.

1562
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,550
My shield is even gone.

1563
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,410
How do I want to defeat this guy?

1564
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:59,050
Can I even defeat this guy?

1565
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,390
Can I even defeat this guy?

1566
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,800
Is this one?

1567
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:16,700
Should I?

1568
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,160
Oh yeah, that's right.

1569
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:22,480
It's unknown.

1570
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,280
Wait, I don't even know...

1571
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,400
Oh wait, I can see what little characters it is.

1572
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:27,980
What symbols.

1573
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:28,960
The sigils.

1574
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,540
It's...

1575
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:36,620
It's...

1576
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,760
Funky Wing.

1577
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,400
And the cool S.

1578
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:41,760
Funky Wing.

1579
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,920
Funky Wing.

1580
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,100
I think that's it.

1581
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,200
Yeah, Funky Wing.

1582
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,880
Where did it go?

1583
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,860
This one?

1584
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,480
This one?

1585
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,100
Cool S.

1586
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,260
Paragon, Paragon.

1587
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,480
Yeah!

1588
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:04,540
Yeah!

1589
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,680
The higher tier takes too long to cast.

1590
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,080
Oh, I see.

1591
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,380
I see, I see.

1592
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,800
So maybe I should just try...

1593
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,120
So if I do this, will it reach him?

1594
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,120
I don't even know.

1595
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,400
Do I have to get really close to him?

1596
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,900
Three is better than five because it's quicker.

1597
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,220
Wow, Aiden!

1598
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,500
Thank you so much for the 50!

1599
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,700
Thank you so much!

1600
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,200
I don't remember... Okay, let's try it.

1601
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,280
That was close.

1602
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Casually wandering.

1603
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,620
He's running out of breath.

1604
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,080
Ouch!

1605
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,000
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

1606
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,180
Alright.

1607
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,640
Am I too close?

1608
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,820
And I attack in blue!

1609
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,980
How did you like that?

1610
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
And then I will do it again!

1611
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,620
Can I poison... Will this poison him?

1612
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,060
If I do it in the purple?

1613
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,440
I still got him though.

1614
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,780
Keep running, Roberto!

1615
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:25,940
Roberto?

1616
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,440
Roberto, get your steps in.

1617
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,020
Get your steps in, Roberto.

1618
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,540
Look, yep, yep.

1619
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,940
Spell nine is expensive.

1620
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:39,440
Oh!

1621
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,260
Oh my gosh.

1622
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:41,260
How did I...?

1623
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,100
Roberto!

1624
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,360
He did his big steps.

1625
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,280
He stepped over the spell.

1626
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,480
Should I be good now?

1627
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:49,160
Maybe.

1628
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,380
Ouch!

1629
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:54,800
No!

1630
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,140
You!

1631
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,600
Okay, well he just did it, so maybe I can do it again.

1632
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,380
And...

1633
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,700
Keep it...

1634
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,100
Wow!

1635
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,680
Thank you for the raid!

1636
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:16,300
Thank you!

1637
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,140
Sorry, I have to like zoom in on my desk so that I can see your name because it's white.

1638
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,280
Because YouTube is stupid as hell!

1639
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,660
Thank you so much for the raid!

1640
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,160
Oh my gosh.

1641
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,460
Keep running, Roberto.

1642
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,760
I know.

1643
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,520
You're really out of breath.

1644
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,200
It's okay.

1645
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:38,600
Oh!

1646
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,780
Ah, shoot!

1647
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,520
Don't die on me, Roberto.

1648
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,540
Don't die on me.

1649
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,260
Don't die on me.

1650
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,020
Hi guys, I'm playing Eternal Darkness.

1651
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,620
This game is kind of whack.

1652
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,040
If you're like, what's going on?

1653
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,360
I also don't know what's going on.

1654
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,860
We have this tome of Eternal Darkness.

1655
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:56,900
And...

1656
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,180
We go through time as different people.

1657
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,260
Right now, we're Roberto and we suck.

1658
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,960
We're a weak, weak guy.

1659
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,980
Oh my gosh.

1660
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:08,140
Okay.

1661
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:17,890
That was so close.

1662
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,610
Poor Roberto is doing his best.

1663
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,050
I know!

1664
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,490
I don't dislike him.

1665
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,210
I just wish he were...

1666
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:27,610
different.

1667
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,270
I knew that was going to happen.

1668
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,750
That's why...

1669
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,050
I did this.

1670
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,290
Ah!

1671
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:41,690
Roberto, no!

1672
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:42,910
Roberto!

1673
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,570
Oh, Roberto!

1674
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,790
Oh, Roberto!

1675
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:45,330
Ah!

1676
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:46,610
I'm going to die!

1677
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,210
Can I even heal?

1678
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,090
Wait, what's my recover?

1679
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,890
Oh, there it is.

1680
01:16:58,350 --> 01:16:58,890
Ah!

1681
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,090
Gosh, Roberto!

1682
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:03,570
Run!

1683
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,450
We have to run to get our magic back up, you guys.

1684
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,570
Oh, we're so cooked.

1685
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:18,530
Oh, Roberto.

1686
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:19,590
Oh, Roberto.

1687
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,590
And I can't even leave this room.

1688
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,830
Hayden, thank you so much for the time you've given.

1689
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:32,390
Thank you.

1690
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:33,990
I can't leave the room.

1691
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,850
The door is...

1692
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,410
The door is...

1693
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,070
trapped.

1694
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:37,890
I'm pretty sure.

1695
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,770
I can double...

1696
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:41,030
I can double try, but I think I couldn't leave.

1697
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,590
If you're too far away, we'll keep spamming ranged attacks.

1698
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,370
Helps to be somewhat close to him.

1699
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,310
But far enough to cast.

1700
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:55,310
I don't know.

1701
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,030
Okay.

1702
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:04,430
Droivus is the same actor who plays Porkins in Star Wars.

1703
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,490
And the government agent in Indiana Jones.

1704
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,090
No way.

1705
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,490
All right.

1706
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,670
Which one was it?

1707
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:14,270
This one.

1708
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,170
This is why I saved right outside the room, maybe?

1709
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,570
I think he'll kill the zombies.

1710
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:25,950
I think.

1711
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:27,190
I think they, like...

1712
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,350
The darkness comes.

1713
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:32,870
I think they have, like, a little argument in there.

1714
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:33,890
And so it's...

1715
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,110
you know...

1716
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:39,210
But just in case, I'll have my... my torch.

1717
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,240
But yeah, see?

1718
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,160
When I go to the door, it doesn't say open door.

1719
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,840
So I think I can...

1720
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,980
I think maybe...

1721
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:02,860
Oh my gosh.

1722
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,180
Is he right there?

1723
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,260
Run, run, run!

1724
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:09,540
Okay.

1725
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,440
Alright.

1726
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:15,060
I'm gonna try and do this again with the attack.

1727
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,240
I think.

1728
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,050
So I kind of like waited a little in there.

1729
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:22,470
Okay.

1730
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:22,810
Alright.

1731
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,730
Oh, I'm so dumb!

1732
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,800
Don't mind me.

1733
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,240
Okay.

1734
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,440
He's still doing ranged attacks.

1735
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,200
I guess he's... Oh my gosh.

1736
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,100
You're so gross.

1737
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,700
Leave me alone.

1738
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,980
I think I'm too close to him.

1739
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,140
Hold on.

1740
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,200
Let me get a little further away.

1741
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,520
There we go.

1742
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:06,840
There we go.

1743
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,160
Run, Roberto!

1744
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,000
Run!

1745
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,060
This game is GameCube, actually.

1746
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,740
I don't think it ever got released on anything else other than GameCube.

1747
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,420
This is the strat!

1748
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,280
Just walk!

1749
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,820
Roberto, walk!

1750
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:38,700
Roberto,

1751
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:53,950
walk!

1752
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:54,230
Okay.

1753
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,200
You tired?

1754
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:03,980
Oh, no.

1755
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:04,640
We're still walking.

1756
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,220
We're going in a circle.

1757
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,000
Alright, Roberto.

1758
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,480
Just keep on walking.

1759
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,000
You can see our little magic is going up.

1760
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,740
The moment you don't see him on screen, he will range attack.

1761
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:15,500
Okay.

1762
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,060
Well...

1763
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,780
We're keeping him here.

1764
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,340
Come on, buddy!

1765
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,600
Come here, buddy!

1766
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,460
Come on, buddy!

1767
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,340
Wait.

1768
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,120
This is kind of awesome.

1769
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,260
This is the strat.

1770
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:29,980
Wait.

1771
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,280
I'm going to get a little further from him.

1772
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:33,540
There we go.

1773
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,040
Oh, he got me, though.

1774
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,860
He got me good.

1775
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,860
No!

1776
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,200
No, no, no!

1777
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,720
Oh, okay.

1778
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:47,340
Yeah!

1779
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:47,980
Yeah!

1780
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:48,620
Run!

1781
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:49,580
Run!

1782
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,280
Run!

1783
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,780
Run!

1784
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,900
Oh, yes.

1785
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,440
Roberto is so calm, cool, collected.

1786
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,460
He doesn't care at all.

1787
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,860
What are you looking at, buddy?

1788
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,220
He's like... He's not even paying attention to this thing.

1789
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,220
He's looking at the walls.

1790
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,960
He's doing anything else.

1791
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,180
Roberto!

1792
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,040
Pay attention!

1793
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:16,880
That's fine.

1794
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,380
Oh, hell yeah.

1795
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:20,800
Okay.

1796
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:27,860
Ouch.

1797
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,580
He got me again.

1798
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,850
Got him again.

1799
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:40,610
Okay.

1800
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,210
Gosh, you're a tough guy.

1801
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,250
He's so tall.

1802
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,710
He's so... Not tall.

1803
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,030
Strong.

1804
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,630
I mean, he is really tall, but he's really strong.

1805
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:51,950
Walking the pet dog.

1806
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,230
That's the strat.

1807
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,760
Come here, boy.

1808
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,040
Come on, boy.

1809
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,720
Yeah, he's a good boy.

1810
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,160
Oh, we need to get your toenails trimmed soon.

1811
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,060
Yeah, we do.

1812
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,920
Yeah, he's a good boy.

1813
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,420
He's a good...

1814
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,680
What is...

1815
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,100
He's a good...

1816
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:13,600
Creature.

1817
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,360
Can you get him with a trap or...

1818
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,880
Well, I don't...

1819
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,840
No, actually.

1820
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,460
I'm kind of invested in this strat right now.

1821
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,960
Even though it's, like, the longest.

1822
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,120
I'm coming for you.

1823
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:31,700
Come on.

1824
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:33,780
I'm invested.

1825
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,260
Oh my gosh.

1826
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,280
He seems so done with me, though.

1827
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,140
He seems so tired.

1828
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:39,840
Wait a second.

1829
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,040
Because he's...

1830
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,320
Wait a second.

1831
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:42,780
I have a question.

1832
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,620
Because he's...

1833
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:44,940
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1834
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,700
Because he's red, is he regaining life?

1835
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,900
I just realized that.

1836
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,250
I...

1837
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,210
I'm not sure.

1838
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:04,310
I'm gonna poison him.

1839
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:08,490
Shoot.

1840
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,170
Okay, Roberto.

1841
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,390
Time to get a move on.

1842
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:12,470
No.

1843
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:12,910
Yes.

1844
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:13,390
Maybe.

1845
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,290
I know.

1846
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,690
We have no idea.

1847
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:16,490
We'll see.

1848
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,090
Literally every possible answer.

1849
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,590
I sure hope not.

1850
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,260
Yeah.

1851
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:41,850
Get poisoned.

1852
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:42,430
Get poisoned.

1853
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:46,310
Is my...

1854
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,370
Can I do another one?

1855
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,760
Red enemies don't technically regain health.

1856
01:24:58,820 --> 01:24:59,560
They regrow limbs.

1857
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,300
Their total health pool remains the same.

1858
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,220
This is why the shotgun...

1859
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,420
I trust Red.

1860
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,980
I trust Red.

1861
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,600
Thank you, Red.

1862
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,280
He looks...

1863
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,980
He looks way more tired, you guys.

1864
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:13,680
I think we got this.

1865
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:17,380
He's...

1866
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,760
He's not even red anymore.

1867
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,040
He's like cooked.

1868
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,640
He's burnt.

1869
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,760
He's burnt chicken.

1870
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,900
Thank you for the super chats, by the way.

1871
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,460
Thank you for helping.

1872
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,280
I appreciate it.

1873
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,420
This game is whack.

1874
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,800
In a good way.

1875
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:41,880
All right.

1876
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:42,600
Wait.

1877
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,240
Let's get to...

1878
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,700
Like about here?

1879
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:46,880
Here.

1880
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,380
And...

1881
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,220
I'm gonna poison you again.

1882
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,520
Yeah.

1883
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,360
I'm gonna...

1884
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,420
Yeah.

1885
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:56,900
Get poisoned.

1886
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,480
Get poisoned.

1887
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:57,980
Get poisoned.

1888
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,660
Oh!

1889
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:06,770
It only took 500 years.

1890
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:10,950
But the beast has been defeated.

1891
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,470
Finish him, Roberto!

1892
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:15,110
You earned it!

1893
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,390
Hey, you're pretty part gone.

1894
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,350
Yay!

1895
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:24,650
Good job, Roberto!

1896
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:27,490
And we didn't waste any...

1897
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,010
Um...

1898
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,130
Any resources.

1899
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,530
Any, like...

1900
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:32,770
Arrows or anything.

1901
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,770
It was a completely...

1902
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,550
Risk-free...

1903
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:38,810
Way of doing it.

1904
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,050
Save?

1905
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:41,370
I will.

1906
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,930
I'm just getting my stuff.

1907
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,870
I'm gonna heal first.

1908
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,280
I'm gonna heal.

1909
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,100
I'm gonna get my magic back up.

1910
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,780
Good job, chat.

1911
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,300
We did it.

1912
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:00,940
We did it.

1913
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,280
We did it.

1914
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:01,780
We did it!

1915
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,130
We did it!

1916
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,950
We did it!

1917
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,870
We did it, everybody!

1918
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:17,450
Okay.

1919
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:18,190
This should be good.

1920
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,370
Oh.

1921
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:19,750
Whoops.

1922
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,550
Uh...

1923
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:22,610
Save the game.

1924
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,030
Nice.

1925
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:28,910
Get your...

1926
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:29,750
Get your riches.

1927
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,730
There's a key placed upon the pedestal.

1928
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,250
It glints in the room's soft light.

1929
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,530
Roberto has acquired the first gem.

1930
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:39,890
Forgotten corridor key!

1931
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,130
But what is...

1932
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:48,790
What is this... what is the green spell for?

1933
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,750
Why does it have a green...

1934
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:59,910
Also, what is this room for?

1935
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:01,370
Why is it just full of lava?

1936
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,050
Where are we?

1937
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,170
Oh, we're in this room!

1938
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:08,590
And then if I go down one...

1939
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,710
Which is X...

1940
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:13,430
Yes.

1941
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,390
It's a spa?

1942
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:19,170
Oh, this is the sauna room!

1943
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:24,570
What the?

1944
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:33,050
Oh my gosh!

1945
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:35,290
Grandpa!

1946
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:38,630
Oh no!

1947
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,670
Don't be so weak, Alex.

1948
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:41,710
Yeah, Alex.

1949
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:44,390
Stop being a little baby.

1950
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:45,990
I didn't bring up a weakling.

1951
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:46,810
Oh my gosh!

1952
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:50,070
I don't think that's Grandpa.

1953
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:52,310
You kept all this from me.

1954
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,030
You kept me alone.

1955
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:56,970
You shared nothing with me.

1956
01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:57,470
Grandpa!

1957
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,170
I could never give you the burden.

1958
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:01,830
Grandpa's kind of an asshole.

1959
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:02,790
I wanted you to grow up.

1960
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,930
Grow up and leave me alone.

1961
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:06,690
What?

1962
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:07,070
I wanted you to grow up.

1963
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:07,070
Grow up and leave me alone.

1964
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:08,550
I wanted you to grow up.

1965
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:08,550
Grow up and leave me alone.

1966
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:12,520
But we killed you in your own perilous.

1967
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,200
...

1968
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,480
This can't be happening!

1969
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,280
Grandpa!

1970
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,400
Grandpa, why are you such a jerk?!

1971
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,440
So I'm guessing it goes to this one.

1972
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,720
Do you think those guys are still in there?

1973
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:42,980
Save?

1974
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:43,520
I already did.

1975
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,640
I mean, I can save right here.

1976
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,960
Save scumming for real.

1977
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:48,920
That's okay.

1978
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,780
We're save scumming for real, but that's okay.

1979
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,580
Oh, I have a key.

1980
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,880
The Forgotten Corridor, apparently.

1981
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,520
Nobody wants to go in here.

1982
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,500
Where does it go, anyway?

1983
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,700
It goes...

1984
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,020
to where...

1985
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,280
Wait, what's that room?

1986
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:11,880
Hold on.

1987
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,460
So we're here.

1988
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,160
We're about to go into here, right?

1989
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,120
Yes, we're about to go in here and then we can... Okay, okay, okay.

1990
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:28,740
It's nice how much you love chat and thanks for always starting stream right on time so...

1991
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,060
This can't be happening!

1992
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,220
I wasn't that late today!

1993
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,480
Wow, this room is so fancy!

1994
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,760
Look at all the lions!

1995
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:47,830
Okay.

1996
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:48,350
Okay.

1997
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:51,830
Oh no!

1998
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,190
I was gonna say, so far, so good.

1999
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:54,810
That was a lie.

2000
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:58,070
Do you think there's traps in this room?

2001
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,910
Uh...

2002
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:06,590
Ouch!

2003
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:07,630
Ouch!

2004
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:11,430
How did those guys get so far?

2005
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:13,250
Uh...

2006
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,130
Oh, I see the glow now.

2007
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:16,050
I see it.

2008
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:17,910
Hmm...

2009
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:19,830
Interesting.

2010
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:22,610
Here's the Nikita rocket launcher!

2011
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:22,830
Oh, I see the glow now.

2012
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:24,770
I was gonna say it!

2013
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,150
Or rather, I thought it.

2014
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:29,310
I wasn't gonna say it because I didn't want people to be like...

2015
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:30,510
Mint...

2016
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:33,130
Mint... You can't make everything a Metal Gear reference?

2017
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,050
But come on!

2018
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,510
This is literally a Metal Gear reference.

2019
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,850
How do I get past the yellow?

2020
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,610
What is yellow weak against?

2021
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:48,670
Um, maybe I do a zombie.

2022
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:50,130
Alright, zombie!

2023
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,890
Do your thing!

2024
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,900
Here he comes!

2025
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,840
Here he comes!

2026
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:02,800
I'm a red zombie!

2027
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,480
I'm a red zombie!

2028
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,560
Here I go!

2029
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,420
I'm a red zombie!

2030
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,140
I'm a red zombie!

2031
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,760
I'm very slowly going.

2032
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,420
Alright, here we go!

2033
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:13,820
Oh!

2034
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,040
Oh!

2035
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,060
Oh!

2036
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,820
I'm a red zombie!

2037
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,620
Keep going, red zombie!

2038
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,080
Maybe...

2039
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,960
This was not the answer.

2040
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:34,820
I...

2041
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:35,960
was incorrect.

2042
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,420
Ah, let's see...

2043
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:44,640
Um...

2044
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,500
I gotta walk around to get my...

2045
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,880
energy back up.

2046
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,560
Hmm...

2047
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,820
My magic, I mean.

2048
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:54,500
Hmm...

2049
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,400
Anything can be a Metal Gear reference.

2050
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,060
It's true!

2051
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,740
Good experiment, boss.

2052
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,580
Thank you.

2053
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,620
My hypothesis was...

2054
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:13,040
Red zombie is immune to the piss floor.

2055
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:14,700
Red zombie is immune to the piss floor.

2056
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:15,020
I was...

2057
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,480
Is anybody truly immune to the piss floor?

2058
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,340
Probably not.

2059
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,560
Red shield and dash for it?

2060
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,440
I mean, I did just save.

2061
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,440
If I die, I die.

2062
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:29,140
Dispel magic!

2063
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,340
Do you think I can get rid of it?

2064
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,080
But what gets rid of yellow?

2065
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,260
Red?

2066
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,460
What gets rid of yellow?

2067
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,320
Hmm...

2068
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,160
Purple?

2069
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:46,200
Purple?

2070
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,480
That didn't work either.

2071
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:00,880
That didn't work either.

2072
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,600
Okay...

2073
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,020
What's my magic at?

2074
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:20,610
What's my magic at?

2075
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:21,570
Look at your face.

2076
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:22,130
Look at your face.

2077
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,290
I'm not saying there's something on my face.

2078
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,010
Is there nothing to the left?

2079
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,490
Over here?

2080
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:29,830
Nope.

2081
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:30,950
Won't even let me.

2082
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:31,790
It's an invisible wall.

2083
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,570
There's nothing over here either.

2084
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,970
Another invisible wall.

2085
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,280
Reveal...

2086
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,920
Maybe if I reveal invisible, it will reveal the...

2087
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,960
The way to turn it off!

2088
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,860
Yellow is cut content.

2089
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:01,080
There was supposed to be a fifth ancient god.

2090
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,820
If you win game effects, use yellow.

2091
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,340
Doesn't interact with anything.

2092
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:05,780
Fly?

2093
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,900
I don't have fly.

2094
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,110
The unnamed fifth god is opposite to Manta Rock.

2095
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:22,170
We just don't see them in the Pokémon wheel because you have to see in four dimensions to understand how the balance works.

2096
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,170
If only there was a spell that protected you from attacks.

2097
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:31,070
I guess I can cast it and run for it, man.

2098
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:33,910
I'll try purple.

2099
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:37,810
Let's go!

2100
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:40,250
Let's go!

2101
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:41,990
Oh, wait.

2102
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:43,790
It's actually working.

2103
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:44,810
Run, Roberto!

2104
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,550
Roberto, run!

2105
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:54,030
Roberto...

2106
01:35:54,030 --> 01:35:54,970
Roberto...

2107
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:56,970
Yeah?

2108
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:00,770
Oh, I remember this place too.

2109
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,330
We fought a big guy here.

2110
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,410
I remember, I remember.

2111
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:06,410
Roberto...

2112
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:07,190
Roberto...

2113
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:09,210
Oh!

2114
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:10,470
Roberto, don't fall.

2115
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:12,510
Light those.

2116
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,590
Okay, never mind.

2117
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,220
The worms are speaking to me, you guys.

2118
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,600
The worms...

2119
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:22,780
Ah!

2120
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,240
Hello.

2121
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:29,580
The man babbles incoherently about worms devouring his countrymen.

2122
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,320
And that Roberto will be next!

2123
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,880
The worms!

2124
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,820
The worms, the worms, the worms!

2125
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:36,400
Is this guy gonna...

2126
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,340
Is this guy gonna...

2127
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:39,860
Wow.

2128
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,640
Is this guy gonna turn on me too?

2129
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,140
Such interesting decor.

2130
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:51,400
This carving depicts a man's skeletal remains in the cruel embrace of a multitude of...

2131
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,020
No way!

2132
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,180
Worm-like creatures!

2133
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,680
You know, in my artwork, they call it hentai.

2134
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,340
Are these the things that killed the men in this room?

2135
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,820
Oh my gosh.

2136
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:12,440
Um...

2137
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:16,280
A rope holds the bridge aloft, waiting to be lowered into position.

2138
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,380
Alright, Roberto.

2139
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:19,940
Do it.

2140
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,320
Lower it, Roberto.

2141
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,640
Roberto, cut the rope.

2142
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,180
Roberto, do it.

2143
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,220
Roberto, use your strength.

2144
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,320
Whoa.

2145
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:31,780
What's this?

2146
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,580
Is this... This isn't where I came from.

2147
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:33,940
Is it?

2148
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,260
Oh, I guess it is.

2149
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,540
It's a really, really big door.

2150
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,960
Is this also the worms?

2151
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,280
Oh, this is a different one!

2152
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:42,880
Wow!

2153
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:45,320
A hideous...

2154
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,680
Bass relief?

2155
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:48,960
Bass...

2156
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,760
Bass relief?

2157
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,860
What does that mean?

2158
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,480
Adorns the monolith.

2159
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,460
Humans thrown into a nest of huge worms.

2160
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,620
It is bass.

2161
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,180
I can't get over that the worms are real.

2162
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:27,140
The people have been sacrificed and justified the worms to fuel some unknown, unfathomable I can't get over the worms being real.

2163
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:27,280
This is real.

2164
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,640
I thought it was just in their heads.

2165
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,820
Maybe I can cut it with the sword.

2166
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,320
Roberto, you need to aim.

2167
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:49,520
It worked!

2168
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:53,700
Good job, Roberto.

2169
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,400
If I have to kill that guy, I will.

2170
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,100
Just letting you know.

2171
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:02,220
The worms!

2172
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:03,220
Oh my gosh.

2173
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,180
Why did I not expect other...

2174
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,600
Why did I not expect this to happen?

2175
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,400
Oh my gosh.

2176
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,480
The worms are real!

2177
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,510
Bad worm.

2178
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:16,530
Bad, bad.

2179
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:18,110
Bad worm.

2180
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:19,550
Go back to the depths.

2181
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:21,550
Bad, bad worm.

2182
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:23,850
Go down.

2183
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:26,170
Go down, worm.

2184
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:29,830
Should Roberto try to survey this area?

2185
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:32,630
Hold on.

2186
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:33,810
I have to do something first.

2187
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,710
What is this?

2188
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,870
A lever is mounted on a nearby column.

2189
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,530
Let's survey the area first.

2190
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:56,110
Clearly, what's going to take down this monument are the worms that are burrowed deep beneath whatever is here and making the ground not very solid.

2191
01:39:57,310 --> 01:40:02,170
The dilapidated roof appears to be collapsing in several areas and will need a lot of reinforcement.

2192
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,970
The workers will have to... will have a daunting task ahead of them.

2193
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,710
Is that guy going to turn on me?

2194
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:12,970
I think he's okay.

2195
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,550
He still talks about the worms.

2196
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:17,330
Yeah.

2197
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,870
Okay, let's go pull this lever.

2198
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:26,230
This game is about architecture, apparently.

2199
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:28,210
Are we going down?

2200
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:30,350
Oh no, we're leaving.

2201
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:31,810
Okay, bye.

2202
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:37,410
I guess, yeah, I would need that to open up to... yeah.

2203
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:40,070
Okay, be careful with those worms, you know.

2204
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,550
I'm surprised they didn't give them any weapons or anything.

2205
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,530
To, like, deal with the worms.

2206
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:48,990
Oh, oh, okay.

2207
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:49,670
Yes, I remember.

2208
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:50,170
Okay.

2209
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:52,370
Okay.

2210
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:57,290
Spell list shield cast.

2211
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,330
Level 5 magic.

2212
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,430
Mantarok!

2213
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,170
Run, Roberto!

2214
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:15,170
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

2215
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,230
Oh my god, one shield left.

2216
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:21,550
Wow, it really just lasts the amount of time.

2217
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,730
What did the worm say after it devoured the countrymen?

2218
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:26,150
Paragon meme.

2219
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:30,730
Whew.

2220
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,780
No worm about it.

2221
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,040
Let's see.

2222
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:46,960
Where do I need to go now?

2223
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,720
What did that... imagine maybe opening that did something.

2224
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,540
We still... oh wait, um, X.

2225
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,660
We still have this floor.

2226
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,560
But how do we get there?

2227
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:01,880
Wait!

2228
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,460
That one door, that...

2229
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,340
Oh, oh, wait.

2230
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,080
Maybe pulling the lever opened up this thing over here.

2231
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,140
Um...

2232
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,400
Uh...

2233
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:14,760
Here!

2234
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,600
Yes, it did!

2235
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,520
Wait a... wait.

2236
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,560
Wait a second.

2237
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:24,420
No.

2238
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,620
Just kidding.

2239
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,480
Uh...

2240
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,260
There is another room.

2241
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,120
The other room.

2242
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:30,280
Um...

2243
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,020
Uh...

2244
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:32,560
Um...

2245
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:33,200
This...

2246
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:34,180
This door.

2247
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,060
Here!

2248
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:40,820
Oh.

2249
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:47,940
Please save.

2250
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,420
I just did!

2251
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:49,940
Did you forget to save?

2252
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,160
No!

2253
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:51,740
I literally just saved, you guys.

2254
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:54,600
I literally just saved.

2255
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:55,180
Just now.

2256
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,340
Um...

2257
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,800
I'm new.

2258
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:02,680
Isn't that famous?

2259
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,000
Maiden Mint.

2260
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,720
The anime everyone's talking about?

2261
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:07,940
Yeah.

2262
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,640
I'm the famous anime.

2263
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,000
Well, um...

2264
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,700
Summon a zombie for the splatter.

2265
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:18,880
Oh, no!

2266
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,060
Okay.

2267
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:23,760
Oh.

2268
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:24,680
Why did I do that?

2269
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,600
Get me out of here.

2270
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,520
Summon zombie.

2271
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:34,610
Paragon.

2272
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:34,850
Paragon.

2273
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:35,250
Paragon.

2274
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:36,290
Paragon.

2275
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:36,770
Paragon.

2276
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:37,210
Paragon.

2277
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:37,830
Paragon.

2278
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:38,070
Paragon.

2279
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:39,470
Paragon.

2280
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:40,150
Hold on, Zombie.

2281
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:42,230
I want to tell you.

2282
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:44,430
I want to tell you one thing.

2283
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:50,390
You are a sacrifice, but you are for a great good.

2284
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:50,950
Okay?

2285
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:55,370
Don't let anyone else tell you that you are not a great zombie.

2286
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,570
No, my zombie is looking at me.

2287
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,590
He's like, this is what's going to happen to me?

2288
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:09,230
This is so sad!

2289
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:16,210
Okay zombie, go for it!

2290
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:27,610
I'm sorry!

2291
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:28,010
I'm sorry!

2292
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,070
It's so sad.

2293
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,490
It's so sad.

2294
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:39,210
It was a real one, yeah.

2295
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:43,030
Alright, I'm gonna actually... hold on, let me attach my torch.

2296
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:49,190
What?

2297
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:50,650
Oh no, it's that thing again.

2298
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:53,890
What?

2299
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:56,070
Woah woah woah, what are you... you were summoning already?

2300
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:56,650
What are you doing?

2301
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,090
Did you even know his name?

2302
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,360
Blue gas.

2303
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:07,970
Blue gas is gonna bring my...

2304
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:11,960
Oh gosh.

2305
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,220
The trappers.

2306
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:23,560
Take you down.

2307
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,780
I think I should just run around this guy.

2308
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,200
Bye!

2309
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,480
Wait, but didn't he summon trappers?

2310
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,220
Where are they?

2311
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:32,920
Oh, there's one.

2312
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,560
The walls are bleeding.

2313
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,160
Just keep running, Roberto.

2314
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:47,500
Who cares.

2315
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,520
I have a feeling you're a partner.

2316
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,260
Oh my gosh!

2317
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,480
Who?

2318
01:45:59,500 --> 01:45:59,720
What?

2319
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,760
I am the guardian of this temple.

2320
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:04,080
You're a simp.

2321
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,740
None shall enter except the chosen.

2322
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,420
Oh my god, and his lady friend.

2323
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,180
Ah!

2324
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,400
You told me to speak.

2325
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,340
You didn't even give me a chance.

2326
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:15,320
You are the chosen.

2327
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:15,800
Oh.

2328
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,380
This place is only for the chosen one.

2329
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,920
For many years I have tested those who came here and all have failed.

2330
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:23,000
Oh wait, you are the chosen one.

2331
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,700
You are unaffected by the power I wield.

2332
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:29,680
And thus, must surely be the chosen.

2333
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,100
I?

2334
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,580
Once I was as you were.

2335
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:36,040
Confused and without answers.

2336
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,180
Now I'm dead.

2337
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:38,600
Yet they came in time.

2338
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:39,200
Okay.

2339
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,600
Now my duty is complete.

2340
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,040
Oh!

2341
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,860
I can finally rest.

2342
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:45,340
The walls will ooze human blood.

2343
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,980
No wait, they already do that.

2344
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,920
My sacrifice was not in vain.

2345
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,400
Oh, Karim.

2346
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,220
His girlfriend.

2347
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,840
Right behind him.

2348
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,060
That's a funny looking hat.

2349
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,780
You gonna put that on, Roberto?

2350
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,520
Oh.

2351
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,540
Okay.

2352
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,120
Uh...

2353
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,280
Can I survey this area now?

2354
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:19,840
Roberto can feel the acidic touch of the artifact's magic reaching toward him.

2355
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,380
Using a shred of cloth from his ropes to shield his hands, he retrieves the hovering artifact.

2356
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,420
We saw this thing before.

2357
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:28,980
Did we not?

2358
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:32,180
Everyone, don't forget to get your Minto Happy Now.

2359
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,500
Pre-orders are available now from...

2360
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,740
Oh, hi!

2361
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,280
Oh my gosh, thank you.

2362
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:39,720
Oh yes, you're right.

2363
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,420
Happy pre-orders are available now.

2364
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,260
But if you can't get it right now, that's okay.

2365
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:45,060
Um...

2366
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:46,380
Uh...

2367
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,560
They'll be up for, I think, three weeks.

2368
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,140
And it's made to order.

2369
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,380
So...

2370
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,040
Um...

2371
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,900
Don't feel like they're gonna sell out immediately.

2372
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,980
Wow, VTuber, I just pre-ordered my official Minto Phantom Happy Koda.

2373
01:47:59,020 --> 01:47:59,500
Yeah, nice!

2374
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,100
Thank you!

2375
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,960
Thank you, guys.

2376
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,520
Thank you, thank you.

2377
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:10,320
Um...

2378
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,180
Roberto has acquired the essence of...

2379
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,520
Ullaoi.

2380
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,240
Ullaoi!

2381
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,620
Oh my gosh, the Ruby Effigy!

2382
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,200
Cool.

2383
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,020
Can I survey this room now?

2384
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:32,720
The room appears to be an incredibly ancient shrine to the ancients, as noted in the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

2385
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:37,060
Could this be what Roberto's captor seeks to preserve with his monument?

2386
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:38,960
Candy!

2387
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,740
Welcome to Mambo Chef Taku!

2388
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,320
I've surveyed all the rooms!

2389
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,320
Roberto has completed his survey of the complex.

2390
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:53,780
Now he can return to the surface and report his findings to his captor.

2391
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:54,720
Oh.

2392
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,340
Wait.

2393
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,480
Seriously, I have to leave?

2394
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,080
Oh, okay.

2395
01:48:59,440 --> 01:48:59,880
Um...

2396
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,160
Okay.

2397
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:09,000
Time to head all the way back, I guess.

2398
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:15,840
Roberto, don't die.

2399
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:20,530
That's right.

2400
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,330
Okay, just power walk through it.

2401
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:23,470
Oh my gosh.

2402
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,570
Okay, now run.

2403
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:26,570
Now run.

2404
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:26,950
Yeah.

2405
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:33,050
You're fine.

2406
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:35,210
Just, like, walk through.

2407
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:35,870
Yeah.

2408
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:37,210
Just go.

2409
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:40,650
Alright, then we came through here?

2410
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,410
Wait, what's in here?

2411
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,090
Oh, shhh.

2412
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:49,610
Oh.

2413
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:52,330
We didn't beat this guy either, did we?

2414
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:55,470
Yippee, I free my mind.

2415
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:55,950
Thank you!

2416
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:57,930
Thank you, thank you.

2417
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:59,290
Uh, let's, uh...

2418
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:01,290
Let's spell...

2419
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:02,510
Um, shield...

2420
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:04,490
Cast...

2421
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,020
Good job, Roberto!

2422
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,520
And climb up.

2423
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,180
Oh, we didn't defeat this thing either, did we?

2424
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,080
Oh!

2425
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:25,540
Oh!

2426
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:26,860
Just keep running, Roberto!

2427
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,680
There's never an end!

2428
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,500
Just go!

2429
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,300
Just go!

2430
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:30,940
Just go!

2431
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,060
Just go.

2432
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:36,500
Just go.

2433
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:39,640
Okay.

2434
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,480
It's time to go upstairs.

2435
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:45,100
Upstairs.

2436
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,940
The worms!

2437
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:47,460
The worms!

2438
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,680
Oh, gosh.

2439
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,400
You scared me.

2440
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:50,640
Oh my gosh.

2441
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:51,500
Oh my gosh.

2442
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,220
Uh, down.

2443
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:53,840
Back down.

2444
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:54,420
Back down.

2445
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,020
And through.

2446
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,360
Uh, straight.

2447
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,840
Yes, sir.

2448
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,800
Yes, sir.

2449
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:04,800
Climb up.

2450
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:08,020
Everybody's still working?

2451
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,380
Good job, everybody.

2452
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,280
Nothing to see here.

2453
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:13,900
Ignore my magical presence.

2454
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:16,220
Keep going.

2455
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,720
Run, Roberto!

2456
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:18,420
Oh.

2457
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:19,720
Oh, yes.

2458
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,120
That was our first dead friend.

2459
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:21,480
Oh, yes.

2460
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:21,780
Wasn't it?

2461
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:22,260
Wait.

2462
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,880
What is this thing right here?

2463
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,440
I feel like I should...

2464
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,380
Should I do a reveal invisible and, like, something shows up?

2465
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:35,560
Hmm.

2466
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:40,980
Like, I feel like something should be here, right?

2467
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:44,380
Tis a lump.

2468
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,700
It's nothing?

2469
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:47,720
Try it?

2470
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,840
Because we have...

2471
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:52,980
We have red and blue.

2472
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,640
What if we did green?

2473
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,840
Just gonna try it.

2474
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,420
Oh.

2475
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,040
Just kidding.

2476
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:04,020
What if...

2477
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:04,560
Paragon.

2478
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:05,740
Record seven.

2479
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,900
What if...

2480
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:06,920
Paragon.

2481
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,440
Liars.

2482
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,600
Everyone is a liar.

2483
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:12,500
Everyone's a liar.

2484
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:17,380
Paragon.

2485
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:18,520
Oh!

2486
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,460
And what news do you bring?

2487
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,760
Bring me, architect.

2488
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:26,840
The...

2489
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,500
The foundations are infested.

2490
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:29,880
By worms!

2491
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,500
The demons and devils.

2492
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,220
And worms!

2493
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:34,280
Many lives will be lost if you try to build there.

2494
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:36,620
This is very shapely today.

2495
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,320
You have done well to complete your goal, Bianchi.

2496
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,440
The construction will continue as planned.

2497
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:41,880
Oh, no.

2498
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,120
But the demons.

2499
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,200
You'd be insane to build this.

2500
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:45,700
It's the sky.

2501
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,140
Silence, dog.

2502
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:50,560
What dwells beneath the Forbidden City...

2503
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,140
It's shapely.

2504
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,660
...is the very reason it was built.

2505
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,460
Just you and me.

2506
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:54,540
Wait.

2507
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:56,020
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2508
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,880
My face is going to become so round.

2509
01:52:59,020 --> 01:52:59,940
I don't even know.

2510
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,840
Let me educate you.

2511
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:03,740
Guard!

2512
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,640
Put this one with the others at the sacrifice.

2513
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:09,320
What do you mean?

2514
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:09,900
Sacrifice?

2515
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,040
Oh, no, Roberto.

2516
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:24,460
I am the scourge of God appointed to chastise you, since no one knows the remedy for your iniquity!

2517
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,160
AHHHHH!

2518
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:37,080
Um...

2519
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,900
Oh my god!

2520
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,220
NOOOOOO!

2521
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:49,140
Does he die?

2522
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:55,600
Oh god!

2523
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,380
He's in the walls!

2524
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,500
He's in the walls!

2525
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,360
Oh my gosh!

2526
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:01,760
Roberto's in the walls!

2527
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,800
How did they do that?

2528
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:13,710
Chapter complete!

2529
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:16,930
That chapter wasn't even that long actually.

2530
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:20,310
Maybe I should keep going.

2531
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:27,770
Alex, are you okay?

2532
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:29,570
Feeling a little woozy?

2533
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,040
Oh my gosh.

2534
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,400
Is that why we've been hearing...

2535
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:42,760
WHAT?!

2536
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,980
Should Alex try to survey the area?

2537
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,220
No way!

2538
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:49,880
An unseen force guides Alex's hand towards the painting.

2539
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,680
Wait, compelling her to look behind it.

2540
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:55,380
She reaches out and pulls back the painting and discovers a chapter page!

2541
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:58,860
Should Alex retrieve the chapter page?

2542
01:54:58,880 --> 01:54:59,080
Yes.

2543
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:01,420
Her familiarity overcomes her.

2544
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:06,500
And as the chapter page comes to her fingers, so does the realization that Roberto's spirit is aiding her.

2545
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,180
Oh!

2546
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,400
I was like, I hear the...

2547
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:15,000
Didn't we hear the rocks and stuff before?

2548
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:16,140
Is that why?

2549
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:17,960
Oh my gosh.

2550
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:19,960
Roberto...

2551
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:21,660
ROBERTO!

2552
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:26,700
Uh oh.

2553
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:28,660
Uh oh.

2554
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:35,220
We feed it flesh, but I fear it will not guard the relic too much longer.

2555
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:35,560
Uh oh.

2556
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:38,520
There is no choice in the matter.

2557
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:38,980
Uh oh.

2558
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:43,360
It must remain and guard the artifact until the time of planetary alignment.

2559
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:47,460
After that, the guardian may return to its lair.

2560
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:52,960
Our master does not like failure.

2561
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:56,920
It is imperative to keep the binding intact.

2562
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:02,980
Do you think this guy even has a model or is he just like a big shadow mass with a face?

2563
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:07,860
Did they even give him like a body?

2564
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,880
Like a proper texture or anything?

2565
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:14,680
He's just...

2566
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,820
I can't see anything.

2567
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:25,200
Uh...

2568
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,760
A war to end all wars!

2569
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:28,380
Whoa!

2570
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,160
Also a fantastic chapter.

2571
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,520
Also you can save the nurses, but it's extremely difficult.

2572
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,240
I usually only manage to save one.

2573
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:37,420
Nurses, you say?

2574
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:40,460
Wow, that gives me a little bit of motivation to...

2575
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:42,180
to...

2576
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,160
play this one.

2577
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:48,180
That last chapter wasn't even so bad.

2578
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,780
Actually, I feel like that was one of the easiest chapters we've done.

2579
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,440
Wow.

2580
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:56,620
Alex is so cool.

2581
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,360
It wasn't even so bad, right?

2582
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,420
Like it was...

2583
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:00,280
...

2584
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:05,760
This one is much harder.

2585
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:06,340
Oh no!

2586
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:09,220
It's a fun chapter.

2587
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,340
I don't know why people say it's bad.

2588
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,180
Maybe because it's like...

2589
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,060
A little...

2590
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,740
What's the word?

2591
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:20,860
How's my sanity?

2592
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:23,100
Oh, it's low.

2593
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:26,660
Um...

2594
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:28,760
Uh...

2595
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,340
Sluggish?

2596
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:32,100
You can't fight back?

2597
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:32,700
I guess so.

2598
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:35,260
It is hard to fight back.

2599
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,640
Maybe that's why people are like...

2600
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,020
Not so fun.

2601
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:43,920
Let's see if there's any strange happenings around with our sanity being so low.

2602
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,300
This door is locked.

2603
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:49,180
You already have the chapter page.

2604
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:49,680
Yeah, I know.

2605
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:51,920
I just want to see if there's any strange...

2606
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,640
Any fun... What's it called?

2607
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,160
Is that what we get?

2608
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,500
Uh... Sanity thingies.

2609
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,920
Oh, I just heard something squelchy.

2610
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:04,860
What am I hearing?

2611
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,440
And this guy is looking at us.

2612
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,400
Yeah, as he does.

2613
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,040
Anything I can hear?

2614
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,660
Ew, it's so squelchy.

2615
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,060
It's so squelchy!

2616
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:23,460
Oh!

2617
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,440
Can it drip on us?

2618
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,200
No.

2619
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:35,660
Yeah, just the ceiling bleeding as it does.

2620
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:36,980
Oh, it's too dark.

2621
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:37,320
That's right.

2622
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,280
I need a torch.

2623
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,340
Or something.

2624
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:41,500
Okay.

2625
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:43,300
Well, nothing interesting seems to be happening.

2626
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:46,760
Our normal, normal bloody house.

2627
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:48,880
As is.

2628
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,280
Because last time we saw the guy...

2629
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,780
Well, maybe the guy being hung was normal.

2630
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,280
Maybe that was supposed to happen.

2631
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,880
Because we had to go in there for the piano.

2632
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,020
Oh, I mean this room.

2633
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:06,530
Anything in here?

2634
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,240
I know.

2635
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:14,240
I can't tell if... There's a rat in my house!

2636
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:16,620
Ah!

2637
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:22,080
I can't tell if it's an actual AOL door closed or if it's just very, very similar.

2638
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,800
What is that?

2639
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:52,380
What's laughing at me?

2640
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:54,780
It's like...

2641
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:58,600
That was freaky.

2642
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,260
That was freaky.

2643
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,460
That was freaky.

2644
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,560
A war to end all wars.

2645
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,320
So, wait.

2646
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:07,940
Is this one...

2647
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:08,980
You guys said this one's difficult?

2648
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,280
I don't know.

2649
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,280
I feel like maybe I could do it.

2650
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,280
How many chapters have we done?

2651
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,160
I can't even remember.

2652
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,240
That's me, guys.

2653
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:21,840
I have a cold.

2654
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,660
It's not really.

2655
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:28,780
It's not straightforward.

2656
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,680
This is chapter nine.

2657
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:32,900
It's hard or not terrible.

2658
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,560
To be honest, the Dancer's chapter is the hardest in the game.

2659
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,020
The Dancer?

2660
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,740
Have I gotten that one?

2661
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:45,130
I think this one is long.

2662
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,750
Huh?

2663
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:53,390
Essence of Mantarok.

2664
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:55,130
Look at this thing.

2665
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:56,390
Mantarok's heart.

2666
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:00,250
Talking about the method of execution, it's being hanged.

2667
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:04,530
A guy being hung has different implications for the sanity effect you saw.

2668
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:07,270
Oh.

2669
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,240
I...

2670
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:15,320
Yeah.

2671
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,380
Oh.

2672
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:25,940
Next character has a major handicap to sanity, but otherwise he's strong.

2673
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,240
You can always start it.

2674
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:29,980
Yeah, let's start it.

2675
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,880
Let's start it at least.

2676
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,180
Oh.

2677
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,860
Yes, yes.

2678
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,560
Read it now?

2679
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:33,880
Yeah.

2680
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:36,400
Come on, Alex, let's read our thing.

2681
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:42,360
War, war, war, war, war.

2682
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,160
Every day?

2683
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:58,440
War has changed.

2684
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:01,620
What?

2685
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,480
Never changes.

2686
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:09,520
His implication about the ancient's involvement with the war was hideous and so obvious.

2687
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:10,940
Obvious?

2688
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:19,740
With the horror of the Battle of the Somme scant miles away and the distant echoes of pounding artillery, a young journalist named Peter Jacob Peter?

2689
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:20,960
Peter.

2690
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:23,820
1916?

2691
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:26,540
His grim task brought him to Oublier Cathedral.

2692
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:27,440
Oublier?

2693
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,680
Now transformed into a field hospital.

2694
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:30,520
Wait.

2695
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:31,740
Do we know this place?

2696
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:32,380
Oh no.

2697
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,240
Oh no.

2698
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:35,540
Oublier?

2699
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,100
I find no solace in the purpose behind all the senseless violence.

2700
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,920
Are we actually in World War I?

2701
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:45,140
Young men die at a rate unheard of in centuries of warfare.

2702
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:52,120
Shelling, machine guns, and mustard gas rip, pierce, and burn to flesh.

2703
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:52,960
Peter!

2704
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:54,060
Oh my god, Peter.

2705
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,540
Peter has truly seen war.

2706
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,300
You see those eyes?

2707
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:01,580
The hospitals here cannot cope with the torrent of wounded.

2708
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:02,660
Oh my god.

2709
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:04,360
Peter.

2710
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,260
Peter needs some real therapy.

2711
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:07,960
Peter does not look okay.

2712
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:12,020
I think there might be a better way to carry that guy.

2713
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,220
I'm just saying.

2714
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,740
This poor dude is getting dragged.

2715
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:21,440
He's like...

2716
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:22,520
Whoa!

2717
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,240
Oh my god!

2718
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:26,460
What's this?

2719
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,360
A soldier's letter lies on the table waiting to be sent home.

2720
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,700
Soldier's letter!

2721
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,980
Yes, we've been to this place.

2722
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,420
We've been to this place.

2723
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,380
Oh my gosh.

2724
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:42,940
Oh my gosh.

2725
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,620
This is...

2726
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,280
This is dramatic.

2727
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,280
First letter from Private Reginald Jackson to his love Margaret.

2728
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,140
Oh my gosh!

2729
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:56,620
I was admitted to this hospital on Tuesday.

2730
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:04,560
The damage caused to my legs was slight, but there is no way that I could ever walk normally again.

2731
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,080
Oh my gosh, Peter.

2732
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:08,700
I hate this place.

2733
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,960
Every day I am reminded that I will never be able to do the things I love.

2734
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,560
The hospital is a very strange place.

2735
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:20,200
Converted from an old cathedral, there is an odd atmosphere around it.

2736
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:25,460
Saddened before the words of the wounded calling out in the night.

2737
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:28,020
There is no doubt, it is haunted.

2738
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,720
And that ghost?

2739
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:31,920
Me.

2740
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:37,000
Yeah, this game actually only has like three or four locations.

2741
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,460
Also, yay, World War One, blood for the blood god.

2742
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:45,600
What I find most odd in this place is that you never see anyone leave during the day.

2743
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,680
It's not right.

2744
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,600
No goodbyes or farewells.

2745
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,520
Just an empty bed when you wake.

2746
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,040
What the?

2747
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:53,360
A lucky penny?

2748
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,460
Oh, I thought that was meat.

2749
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:59,720
An old coin marked in a peculiar manner.

2750
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:02,100
It has held sentimental value for someone.

2751
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:05,600
Whoever holds the penny will undoubtedly receive good fortune.

2752
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,340
It has blood on it.

2753
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,300
The meat coin.

2754
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:10,980
Flash pen.

2755
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:11,680
He's a photographer?

2756
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:14,500
This is a photographer's flash pen.

2757
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:20,000
Used to hold combustible powders that when ignited create a large white flash.

2758
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:22,980
This can be used to stun some enemies.

2759
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,960
And we have the flash powder.

2760
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:28,400
Very interesting.

2761
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:33,720
Covered with blood stained sheets these poor souls have passed from this world.

2762
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,500
For them, the suffering is over.

2763
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,900
But for those around them, the ordeal continues.

2764
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:45,140
The faint sound of moaning emanates from behind the linen veils.

2765
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:45,740
Whoa!

2766
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:47,740
What's going on in there?

2767
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:56,480
Whispered utterances, frantic prayers to love words offered only by those who face their morality.

2768
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:59,140
Spicy, yeah, indeed.

2769
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:00,420
This guy's dead.

2770
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:10,000
With a motherly voice, the nurse advises that Peter get some rest.

2771
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,900
Get some...

2772
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,340
Get some rest, Peter.

2773
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,780
The soldier is rather distressed.

2774
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:21,060
Perhaps he has lost a lot of friends to the trenches of the psalm.

2775
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:27,280
He confides that the only stories are sad ones and that the only true heroes are in the mortuary.

2776
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,580
I think this nurse likes me.

2777
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:34,760
She knew me by name.

2778
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,900
The soldier is rather distressed.

2779
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:38,880
They all say the same thing.

2780
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,980
Soldiers don't have original thoughts, I guess.

2781
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,480
Are you gonna tell me to get some rest?

2782
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:45,320
Wait, I've been here!

2783
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:46,760
I've been down there before!

2784
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:47,160
Let me in!

2785
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:51,160
The guard quietly but strongly points out that the area is off limits to civilians.

2786
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,520
I'm a soldier!

2787
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,420
I'm no civilian!

2788
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:57,400
I...

2789
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:58,660
We can't even play!

2790
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,520
We can't even play the organ!

2791
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,580
The guard frowns and ushers Peter away from the organ.

2792
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:11,240
He explains that it is one of the few antiques in the region that has so far survived the war.

2793
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,260
And that, while he is alive, it will remain intact.

2794
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,580
Oh yeah, we're journalists.

2795
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,080
That's right.

2796
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,340
I'm not a soldier.

2797
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:19,840
Sorry.

2798
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:20,860
What's this?

2799
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,200
Sealed envelope!

2800
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:25,800
Whaaaaat?

2801
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:27,620
Whaaaaat?

2802
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,460
I'm gonna unseal it.

2803
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,560
Soldier's orders!

2804
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,800
An official note on Army Regulation Stationary.

2805
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:54,900
The note reads Private Thompson, by order of Lieutenant Hargraves on behalf of HRH George V, you are to leave your post of duty and rally in the street outside Oblee Cathedral.

2806
02:07:56,360 --> 02:07:59,340
Further orders will be presented by the rallying point.

2807
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,660
God save the King!

2808
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:03,420
Boo!

2809
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:14,760
Abruptly, the guard asks if Peter has clearance for the old tower, as it is a restricted area.

2810
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:18,180
HRH, His Royal Highness.

2811
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:29,020
Let's see...

2812
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:33,760
Let's go downstairs, I guess.

2813
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:45,170
This is... How is anybody supposed to sleep like this?

2814
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:47,350
My goodness.

2815
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:48,230
What is this?

2816
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:48,430
A?

2817
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:49,130
R?

2818
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:54,630
The guard shifts about, obviously bored with his duty and awaiting a replacement or perhaps a call to honor.

2819
02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:01,410
Zone A.

2820
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:03,210
Wow.

2821
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:05,990
His Royal Highness King George V.

2822
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:09,110
King of the United Great Britain and Ireland.

2823
02:09:09,410 --> 02:09:11,250
Emperor of India and defender of the faith.

2824
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:15,390
With the war being so close, a curfew has been imposed.

2825
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:17,630
Traveling outside the hospital is not a safe thing to do.

2826
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:19,730
Since intruders will likely be shot on sight.

2827
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:21,170
Peter decides to remain...

2828
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:23,470
Do you hear what's going on out there, Peter?

2829
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:24,810
I don't think you...

2830
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:26,310
You wanna go out?

2831
02:09:26,870 --> 02:09:28,670
I was gonna say, there's a room...

2832
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,970
over here.

2833
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:33,030
Okay, the camera angle was different, so I didn't quite recognize it.

2834
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,250
Nurse.

2835
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:41,290
Oh, stack deeply on the landing crates of medical supplies await use.

2836
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:46,910
Serrets of morphine, bandages, tourniquets, antiseptics, the list goes on and on.

2837
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:48,930
Hello, nurse.

2838
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:50,530
Can you talk to me?

2839
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:52,390
I think I have a fever.

2840
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:57,670
Nurse, I think I have a fever.

2841
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:03,670
I don't think there's a...

2842
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:04,930
Is there anybody alive here?

2843
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:08,250
All there are are...

2844
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:09,910
are just...

2845
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:11,670
bodies.

2846
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:13,110
Rows and rows of bodies.

2847
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,180
I'm not gonna lie...

2848
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,400
The...

2849
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:28,820
The bombs sounds and effects get old pretty quickly.

2850
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,420
Soldier's letter!

2851
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:38,820
Second letter from Private Reginald Jackson to his love, Margaret.

2852
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:45,760
I've been here for over a week now, and there is no word when I will be allowed to leave.

2853
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:47,320
Strange things have happened.

2854
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:49,760
At night, the sounds of the hospital change.

2855
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:54,000
Echoes of voices that don't belong to anyone haunt the walls and corridors.

2856
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,560
The restless ghosts, perhaps.

2857
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,160
Or sounds of movement or whispers.

2858
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:09,020
I have seen war firsthand, and the sounds at night in this hospital scare me more than I ever thought possible.

2859
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,280
What is going on here at night?

2860
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,860
Why do I feel so threatened?

2861
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:16,600
My fears are worsened by the talk of the other young soldiers.

2862
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:20,540
One said he had heard cries for help in the middle of the night.

2863
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:26,260
Cries that were only answered by snarls of rage and not compassion.

2864
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:28,840
I thought this was going to be like love letters.

2865
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:32,960
You can't say that these are letters to his love of his life.

2866
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:37,260
First ever woman in his life.

2867
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:43,640
The most important person to him ever, and then it not be like a spicy letter to Margaret.

2868
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:49,020
Not compassion.

2869
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:55,100
Another said Lance Corporal Haskell has not been discharged, but has gone missing.

2870
02:11:55,620 --> 02:12:00,960
I stare at his empty bed with a sense of unholy dread gnawing at my heart.

2871
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,180
Margaret's like, that's weird.

2872
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,820
Weird, weird, weird.

2873
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:12,500
Oh, we're in the bell tower.

2874
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,240
What's this?

2875
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:16,580
There's like something there.

2876
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:17,200
You see it?

2877
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,680
It's like a little lit up.

2878
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:20,680
But I can't.

2879
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:24,460
Punch it, Peter!

2880
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,280
Punch it!

2881
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:27,580
What is that?

2882
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:32,500
Okay.

2883
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:36,460
Let's go back down, Peter.

2884
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:41,540
He's got a good fist.

2885
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,320
Okay, where else can I go?

2886
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:48,780
Hmm.

2887
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,960
We can look at these, but we can't examine them.

2888
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:56,220
Pew!

2889
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:03,030
Nurse, I'm lost!

2890
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,470
Nurse, I'm lost!

2891
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:06,330
Nurse, I don't know where to go!

2892
02:13:06,830 --> 02:13:06,870
Nurse, I don't know where to go!

2893
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:15,310
Uh-huh.

2894
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:17,170
Is this my bed?

2895
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:20,470
No, that's a dead man.

2896
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:23,510
She told me to go rest, but like...

2897
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:24,650
Where?

2898
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,250
Is there someplace I haven't explored?

2899
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:28,790
Oh, there's another door over here!

2900
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:29,110
Maybe.

2901
02:13:31,610 --> 02:13:32,510
It looks...

2902
02:13:32,510 --> 02:13:34,270
Like perhaps there...

2903
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:36,090
Oh.

2904
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:39,050
No, I just didn't explore the corner of the room.

2905
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:39,790
Huh?

2906
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:45,110
Um...

2907
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:48,990
Rest in the nurse's bed?

2908
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:50,630
Maybe this one over here?

2909
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:55,790
It's the only clean one.

2910
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:58,230
Can I...

2911
02:13:58,230 --> 02:13:58,890
Sleep?

2912
02:14:00,490 --> 02:14:00,950
Please?

2913
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:02,870
Can I go to sleep?

2914
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:06,870
I got the orders.

2915
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:10,230
Oh, you think it'll let me leave?

2916
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:13,670
Maybe in here.

2917
02:14:13,870 --> 02:14:14,690
Wait, what was it?

2918
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:15,510
What were the orders again?

2919
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,530
Sorry, I forgot.

2920
02:14:17,690 --> 02:14:18,390
Soldier's orders.

2921
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:19,290
Uh...

2922
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:23,210
It tells us to go...

2923
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:24,910
Oh, outside!

2924
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:25,850
What?

2925
02:14:26,110 --> 02:14:26,830
Oh, okay.

2926
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:28,030
We're going outside.

2927
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:46,320
Maybe...

2928
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,000
This guy.

2929
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:49,820
Hey, man.

2930
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:52,340
You go outside instead of me.

2931
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:53,300
Oh, oops.

2932
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:55,220
I don't wanna go out.

2933
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:56,340
You go outside!

2934
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:01,020
The guard unfolds the orders and begins to read them before exclaiming...

2935
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:03,100
Bloody hell, lad!

2936
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,200
We must be on the offensive!

2937
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,600
Following the orders...

2938
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:07,940
He takes leave of his post.

2939
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:08,900
Okay, bye!

2940
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:14,480
I was gonna go outside, but maybe...

2941
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,840
You should go outside instead.

2942
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:16,580
Oh!

2943
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:25,560
A gun!

2944
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,980
A revolver!

2945
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:32,500
Should Peter pick up the revolver?

2946
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:33,840
Yeah, baby!

2947
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,800
Oh my gosh.

2948
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:45,560
Wait.

2949
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,040
Examine.

2950
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:49,780
Thank you.

2951
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:50,900
Oh.

2952
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:56,900
Designed to muster patriotic feelings, these posters declare that the allies are fighting the good fight.

2953
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:04,260
It's small comfort for the occupants of the room, who spent corpses lying on the cold cathedral floor.

2954
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:04,820
Oh.

2955
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:07,900
Uh, was there anything else in here?

2956
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:11,600
Stacked like logs, Peter stands before the price of human war.

2957
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:18,500
The bloodied corpses of young men who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend their own countries and those of others.

2958
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:20,920
Okay.

2959
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:24,900
The music changed.

2960
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,380
Uh oh!

2961
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,980
Time to get a tow.

2962
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,920
Oh my gosh!

2963
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:36,820
It added someone!

2964
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:39,480
Oh my gosh!

2965
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,540
Oh my gosh!

2966
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:41,940
Bianchi!

2967
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:45,440
Bianchi's been added to the list!

2968
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:47,120
Oh no!

2969
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,020
This is looking pretty full in here.

2970
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:54,040
Maybe we have one more on the right.

2971
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:14,010
Oh my gosh!

2972
02:17:14,430 --> 02:17:19,810
I don't

2973
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,460
want to finish him with the gun though.

2974
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:31,500
I have nothing else to equip.

2975
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:35,100
Can I unequip it?

2976
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:37,420
Finish him!

2977
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:39,640
Okay.

2978
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,660
Nevermind.

2979
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:50,920
Uh, the demons are here, everybody!

2980
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:52,240
Be careful!

2981
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,040
Oh!

2982
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,620
Oh my

2983
02:18:01,410 --> 02:18:01,650
god!

2984
02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:04,570
Oh shoot!

2985
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:05,750
I think I just shot the nurse.

2986
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:06,990
Um.

2987
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:09,230
Is she possessed now?

2988
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:12,090
She doesn't notice me.

2989
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:13,570
You're fine, right nurse?

2990
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:16,810
Who's noticing me?

2991
02:18:16,970 --> 02:18:17,990
Oh my gosh!

2992
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:18,410
Wait!

2993
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:18,690
Wait!

2994
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:23,270
I have nothing!

2995
02:18:23,630 --> 02:18:25,550
I have two bullets!

2996
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:30,670
Just run, Peter.

2997
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:34,610
It's become a real survival horror game now.

2998
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:48,020
Two bullets is not enough to kill anything that moves.

2999
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:51,440
My magic!

3000
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,340
Oh, so true!

3001
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:56,560
I forgot I picked up the tome.

3002
02:18:58,340 --> 02:18:58,820
Um.

3003
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:00,220
Let's just...

3004
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,220
Run.

3005
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:09,380
It is possible to save the nurse?

3006
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:09,720
Yeah.

3007
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:12,660
You have to shoot the bone thieves before they burrow in.

3008
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:14,800
Yeah, I figured that was the case.

3009
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:16,360
I'm not gonna...

3010
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,420
I'm not gonna...

3011
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:20,860
I'm not gonna, like, you know...

3012
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,540
Hey, pay attention to me instead!

3013
02:19:24,380 --> 02:19:25,580
Um, I have nothing else.

3014
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:27,740
Oh my god!

3015
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:31,940
Spell nine was the attack, right?

3016
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:32,860
Uh...

3017
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:41,680
Wait, did that hurt her too?

3018
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:43,080
Why are you getting hurt?

3019
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:43,480
Ah!

3020
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:47,460
Oh, I think she's dead.

3021
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:51,560
Um...

3022
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:53,220
Oh!

3023
02:19:58,840 --> 02:19:59,580
Did I just...

3024
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:01,040
Oh!

3025
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:01,900
It's inside me!

3026
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:02,860
Oh my gosh!

3027
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:05,680
Oops.

3028
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:09,480
Oh!

3029
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:13,320
Peter has perished!

3030
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:14,800
That's okay.

3031
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,340
I don't think I saved before...

3032
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:20,220
Before we...

3033
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,520
Got the gun.

3034
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:22,940
Or after we got the gun, rather.

3035
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:24,720
Wow.

3036
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,280
Okay.

3037
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:31,000
Oh shit!

3038
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:31,740
I didn't save at all!

3039
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:38,720
Oops.

3040
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:43,840
I got so into it.

3041
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:45,460
I was like, Peter can do it.

3042
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:49,360
Guys, do you remember when I didn't have a memory card?

3043
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,680
Can you imagine?

3044
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:52,820
Can you imagine?

3045
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,000
I'll just skip through it.

3046
02:20:59,140 --> 02:21:04,800
The war to end all wars redefined how mankind looked at war and the value of human life.

3047
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:05,380
I can't skip it?

3048
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:10,500
Over 19,000 men lost their lives every day in the trenches of the Somme.

3049
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:12,740
Some say uselessly.

3050
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,260
Some invoke a higher cause.

3051
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:20,160
I read accounts of the slaughter from many journalists who spent time in the trenches.

3052
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:25,240
But I found the account of a certain Peter Jacob to be the most horrible of all.

3053
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:32,100
His implication about the ancients' involvement with the war was hideous and so obvious.

3054
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:32,900
Okay, nevermind.

3055
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:45,180
With the horror of the battle of the Somme scant miles away and the distant echoes of pounding artillery, a young journalist named Peter Jacob researched his latest story from the front lines.

3056
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:52,180
His grim task brought him to Oublié Cathedral, now transformed into a field hospital.

3057
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:53,860
Oublié.

3058
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:57,420
Oublié.

3059
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:02,280
Why are all these cutscenes unskippable?

3060
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,600
Peter, Peter, Peter.

3061
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:09,840
Shelling.

3062
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:12,320
Oh, we're gonna watch this again.

3063
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:14,420
Come on.

3064
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:15,720
You gotta be able to care...

3065
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,440
Get another guy to help you.

3066
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:18,120
...

3067
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:22,540
...

3068
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,020
...

3069
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:25,260
...

3070
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:29,040
...

3071
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:29,640
...

3072
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:30,140
...

3073
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:39,280
Oh.

3074
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:42,720
Oh, there he comes.

3075
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:43,700
...

3076
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:44,280
...

3077
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:50,850
Okay, we picked up the soldier's letter.

3078
02:22:51,410 --> 02:22:52,050
...

3079
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:56,430
It's okay, we can easily get back to where we were.

3080
02:22:56,490 --> 02:22:58,410
To where we were before.

3081
02:22:59,350 --> 02:22:59,670
...

3082
02:23:00,690 --> 02:23:02,370
No worries at all.

3083
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:03,550
Peter Jacob.

3084
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:04,930
...

3085
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:11,330
There was one other letter.

3086
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:12,950
We'll have to go to the...

3087
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:20,670
...

3088
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,230
Do you think if I open this...

3089
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:23,030
...

3090
02:23:24,070 --> 02:23:25,430
Yeah, I think I have to.

3091
02:23:25,570 --> 02:23:26,830
Because then it's the soldier's order.

3092
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:29,910
Okay, and now we go get the other letter.

3093
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:31,050
...

3094
02:23:31,050 --> 02:23:31,270
...

3095
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,130
...

3096
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:33,370
...

3097
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:34,830
...

3098
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,550
...

3099
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:35,570
...

3100
02:23:35,570 --> 02:23:37,150
Well, not the bell tower, but the other...

3101
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,770
... the non-bell tower.

3102
02:23:39,530 --> 02:23:39,830
...

3103
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:47,800
I'm, I don't know how I feel though, having...

3104
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:48,580
Wait, not yet.

3105
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:51,580
... having only a revolver and...

3106
02:23:51,580 --> 02:23:54,700
... having to rely more on magic than anything else.

3107
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:55,840
I don't know if I liked it.

3108
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:58,360
I don't know if I liked it.

3109
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:00,300
Because the magic takes so long to cast.

3110
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:00,740
Because the magic takes so long to cast.

3111
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:02,980
And those things are fast, the things that I'm fighting.

3112
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:03,660
...

3113
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:07,720
There's a rifle at the altar.

3114
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:08,620
There is?

3115
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:09,680
Oh.

3116
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:11,160
Okay, I'll go check.

3117
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:18,880
Does it only appear after... the bombing though?

3118
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:22,600
Yeah, we'll pre-cast a shield.

3119
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3120
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:24,680
We'll like...

3121
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:29,820
But six shots!

3122
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,420
But no ammo!

3123
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:34,600
Yeah, Ocelot can say as much as he wants if he has...

3124
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:36,360
unlimited ammo.

3125
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,120
Yeah, six shots are all you need if you're Ocelot because he has unlimited ammo in his pockets!

3126
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:47,100
Altar.

3127
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:49,840
Rifle.

3128
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,440
I'm examining.

3129
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:08,160
Altar is cleared of all valuables, not only to prevent looting but also to afford space for medical supplies.

3130
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:11,040
And even as an operating table should the need arise.

3131
02:25:21,350 --> 02:25:22,150
Aww.

3132
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:25,710
Shows up later.

3133
02:25:25,890 --> 02:25:26,210
Okay.

3134
02:25:28,310 --> 02:25:29,110
Aww.

3135
02:25:35,350 --> 02:25:36,630
After the bombing.

3136
02:25:37,010 --> 02:25:37,990
Got it.

3137
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:44,260
Hey buddy, you've been summoned!

3138
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:46,320
Oh.

3139
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:49,340
You've been summoned!

3140
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:52,080
Bye bye!

3141
02:26:02,030 --> 02:26:03,270
These are the ones.

3142
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:05,370
Oh my gosh, the... the bell one?

3143
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:07,090
Is that a bell or is that like a prick?

3144
02:26:07,310 --> 02:26:09,750
Oh gosh, it's so... creepy.

3145
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,650
Oh, it's... wait, it's maybe their helmet.

3146
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:13,210
Ugh.

3147
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:15,210
Don't forget to save this time.

3148
02:26:15,270 --> 02:26:15,590
Don't worry.

3149
02:26:16,310 --> 02:26:16,910
I know.

3150
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:19,970
I'm gonna save after I pick it up.

3151
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:22,670
Ahhh.

3152
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:24,410
Ahhh.

3153
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:24,670
Ahhh.

3154
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:32,580
The music change is so freaky.

3155
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:41,000
Red enchant, purple shield.

3156
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:46,080
Seems to recall the bone thieves getting poisoned if you have a purple shield.

3157
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:47,480
Two shots each.

3158
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:48,460
Thanks, Rhett!

3159
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:52,900
So let's enchant our gun.

3160
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:54,180
Wait!

3161
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,860
When do I get the tome?

3162
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:06,540
When do I get the tome?

3163
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:07,240
On this door?

3164
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:11,700
Oh, okay.

3165
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:12,040
Here it is.

3166
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:17,640
I was gonna say, it's... it's before I fight those guys.

3167
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:19,280
Ok.

3168
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:22,040
Gimme!

3169
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:32,530
So dark... yeah, you could say it's a... an eternal darkness.

3170
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:34,230
There we go.

3171
02:27:35,130 --> 02:27:36,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

3172
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:36,990
Okay.

3173
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:41,790
Let's see, enchant.

3174
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:45,610
Red.

3175
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:48,790
To my revolver.

3176
02:27:59,180 --> 02:27:59,660
Shield.

3177
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:08,220
Purple.

3178
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,480
It's so loud.

3179
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:19,620
Who are you?

3180
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:25,990
Yeah!

3181
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:26,750
Take that!

3182
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:35,680
Oh my gosh.

3183
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:38,900
Do you think I got it?

3184
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:41,300
I don't think so.

3185
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,260
I don't think I got it.

3186
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:50,250
I only have one bullet left.

3187
02:28:52,090 --> 02:28:52,590
Wait!

3188
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:53,410
Why isn't it working?

3189
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:54,430
Run!

3190
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:57,270
Why isn't it working?

3191
02:28:58,610 --> 02:28:59,170
It's...

3192
02:29:00,650 --> 02:29:01,970
Let's see if the rifle is there.

3193
02:29:02,290 --> 02:29:03,090
It is!

3194
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:07,070
A rifle lies on the altar.

3195
02:29:07,390 --> 02:29:09,190
Probably discarded by a fleeing guard.

3196
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:12,110
I got a rifle.

3197
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:15,570
Oh my god, everything is gone.

3198
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:17,070
Why?

3199
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:18,550
Why though?

3200
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:20,530
Huh.

3201
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:25,010
Why was it enchanted and the two shots didn't work?

3202
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:26,110
Hmm.

3203
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:28,390
So frustrating.

3204
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:30,490
You guys want to know about the...

3205
02:29:31,330 --> 02:29:32,310
About the gun?

3206
02:29:32,610 --> 02:29:37,630
The Lee-Enfield Mark III bolt-action rifles are legends in their own time.

3207
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:40,150
Completely reliable even under adverse conditions.

3208
02:29:40,570 --> 02:29:43,530
Over 3 million were produced in Britain, India, and Australia.

3209
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:45,310
Wait, what about our revolver?

3210
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:52,710
This Lebel Model 1892 revolver was introduced prior to World War I.

3211
02:29:52,710 --> 02:30:00,950
A double-action pistol was with a six-shot swing-out cylinder chambered for 8mm French service ammunition.

3212
02:30:02,530 --> 02:30:04,870
Bone thieves dodge ranged attacks while moving.

3213
02:30:05,010 --> 02:30:05,350
What?

3214
02:30:05,630 --> 02:30:06,690
Oh my gosh.

3215
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:12,440
Oh my god.

3216
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,820
Get off of me!

3217
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:22,980
How am I supposed to stop you from moving at me?

3218
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,380
How am I supposed to stop you from moving at me?

3219
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:27,790
Oh my gosh.

3220
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:28,370
I forgot about her.

3221
02:30:30,190 --> 02:30:30,890
Just run.

3222
02:30:32,450 --> 02:30:33,510
Just run, Peeta.

3223
02:30:34,330 --> 02:30:35,630
Just run, Peeta.

3224
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:39,090
I know you're tired.

3225
02:30:39,730 --> 02:30:41,030
You can't stop though.

3226
02:30:42,390 --> 02:30:43,510
You're not allowed to stop running.

3227
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:46,150
Oh.

3228
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,370
Uh.

3229
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:48,190
Uh.

3230
02:30:48,310 --> 02:30:48,510
Oh.

3231
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:49,510
Don't shoot her.

3232
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:49,990
Shoot.

3233
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,510
Wait.

3234
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:50,830
How do I?

3235
02:30:51,010 --> 02:30:51,770
Oh my gosh.

3236
02:30:51,930 --> 02:30:52,990
It keeps...

3237
02:30:52,990 --> 02:30:53,590
Damn.

3238
02:30:55,670 --> 02:30:56,110
Oh my gosh.

3239
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:56,310
Dang it.

3240
02:30:56,350 --> 02:30:56,910
It keeps...

3241
02:30:58,050 --> 02:30:59,790
Getting on the wrong thing though.

3242
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:04,230
I'm just gonna run.

3243
02:31:06,250 --> 02:31:07,010
I can't...

3244
02:31:07,010 --> 02:31:08,510
I can't remember how to change the...

3245
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:10,370
What it focuses on.

3246
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:11,170
That's my fault.

3247
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:20,450
Get bone thieves...

3248
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:21,050
Is this a sword?

3249
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:22,130
Okay.

3250
02:31:22,150 --> 02:31:22,930
Now we're talking.

3251
02:31:23,430 --> 02:31:25,150
The two-edged sword?

3252
02:31:26,030 --> 02:31:26,910
We'll take it.

3253
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:29,170
And...

3254
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:30,050
Let's go.

3255
02:31:30,050 --> 02:31:31,310
Some ammunition.

3256
02:31:33,870 --> 02:31:34,350
Square?

3257
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:37,110
Yeah, it's totally square.

3258
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:37,610
What's this?

3259
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:41,230
The room has fallen into disuse.

3260
02:31:41,310 --> 02:31:43,090
Basically only shoot when they are about to launch.

3261
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:43,470
Okay.

3262
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:49,310
The shelves, once full of books and scrolls, are now rife with dust, bearing nothing but trash and debris.

3263
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:52,070
And rats.

3264
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:56,030
There's so many rats in here.

3265
02:31:56,690 --> 02:31:58,050
Let's use our sword instead.

3266
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:59,270
Might be easier.

3267
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:00,030
Oh.

3268
02:32:01,330 --> 02:32:02,150
I can't remember what this is.

3269
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:03,210
Let's enchant it.

3270
02:32:04,330 --> 02:32:06,470
My sanity is already so low.

3271
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:09,870
Oh.

3272
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:11,430
Red.

3273
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:14,830
Sorry,

3274
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:20,430
nurse.

3275
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:25,150
I don't wanna do it, but...

3276
02:32:25,150 --> 02:32:26,470
Oh my gosh.

3277
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:27,890
Ma'am!

3278
02:32:28,430 --> 02:32:29,410
Oh my god!

3279
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:33,800
Finish him.

3280
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:36,220
Oh my god!

3281
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:54,670
Finish him.

3282
02:32:55,370 --> 02:32:59,610
Damn, he does like multiple swings.

3283
02:32:59,810 --> 02:33:00,490
It's kind of awesome.

3284
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:03,530
How's my health?

3285
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:04,230
Okay.

3286
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:06,050
Stab him good.

3287
02:33:06,210 --> 02:33:06,970
Oh yeah, baby.

3288
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:08,310
I can go in here.

3289
02:33:09,110 --> 02:33:09,570
Oh.

3290
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:10,270
Oh.

3291
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:11,070
Oh.

3292
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:12,710
I'm gonna use my sword.

3293
02:33:13,090 --> 02:33:16,090
I'm gonna use my sword.

3294
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:17,050
Ah!

3295
02:33:18,010 --> 02:33:19,030
Kill him, dead!

3296
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:26,370
Oh my gosh.

3297
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:29,180
I didn't even...

3298
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:29,360
Oops.

3299
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:30,600
I didn't even notice that guy.

3300
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:31,580
Finish him!

3301
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:35,000
Finish him!

3302
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:39,840
Finish him?

3303
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:40,660
Oh.

3304
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:41,120
Oh.

3305
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:42,060
Oh.

3306
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:42,380
Oh.

3307
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:42,440
Oh.

3308
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:46,240
Boxes of medical supplies awaiting use and treatment.

3309
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:52,240
Covered with bloody fingerprints, it is hard to tell whether they are actually used to save lives or just to relieve the suffering.

3310
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:56,100
Oh!

3311
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:58,800
This is new.

3312
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:02,620
Those are bullets right there.

3313
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:03,000
Oh, pick up.

3314
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:03,340
There we go.

3315
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:05,740
I see them.

3316
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:06,940
Oh wow, there's actually a lot in here.

3317
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:08,720
Actually, there's so much in here!

3318
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:09,780
Oh my god!

3319
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,060
Wait.

3320
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,220
Okay, got that one.

3321
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:13,760
Awesome!

3322
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:18,600
Is that a tor- Oh, that's a rat.

3323
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:22,120
I thought it was a torch!

3324
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:22,920
I was so excited!

3325
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:25,800
I am going to save.

3326
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:29,520
Once again, I am saving.

3327
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:33,760
Sorry, nurses.

3328
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:39,060
My life is probably more important than- Oh!

3329
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:42,940
Yay!

3330
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:45,720
I did get a torch after all.

3331
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:50,120
I love the torch.

3332
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:51,460
I love the torch.

3333
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:53,760
I feel like these are going to move.

3334
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:56,580
Actually, if my sanity gets too low...

3335
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:59,460
If my sanity gets too low, what happens with them?

3336
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:03,820
This room has been converted into a rudimentary morgue.

3337
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:06,200
This room only?

3338
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:10,280
I think this entire building has been turned into a morgue.

3339
02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:14,040
Bloodstained sheets cover the unfortunate souls who have passed beyond.

3340
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,830
There's so many rats here.

3341
02:35:22,930 --> 02:35:26,110
If we don't die from the war, we're going to die from disease.

3342
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:32,030
The altar stands wreathed in cold mist.

3343
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:35,370
As Peter nears the stone, a sense of deep woe gnaws at his heart.

3344
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:39,590
The cathedral is undoubtedly evil, and not the holy place he had thought it to be.

3345
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:44,250
That is how it tended to happen.

3346
02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:44,910
Yeah.

3347
02:35:47,870 --> 02:35:49,210
There's nothing else in here, was there?

3348
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:52,350
But we got...

3349
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:54,770
A sword.

3350
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:55,770
Which I'm actually...

3351
02:35:55,770 --> 02:35:58,430
The guys can't be killed by the flames, can they?

3352
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:01,190
So we have to put on our sword again.

3353
02:36:02,430 --> 02:36:04,370
And I shall enchant it.

3354
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:15,860
Sword.

3355
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:21,880
Paragon.

3356
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:22,680
Paragon.

3357
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,020
And I'm going to heal.

3358
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,100
Very good.

3359
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:35,320
Come out, guys.

3360
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,300
I know you were following me.

3361
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:38,580
Where are you?

3362
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:40,040
Is this...

3363
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,220
Aww.

3364
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,460
A guard lies dead at the foot of the steps.

3365
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:47,960
Viciously assassinated by the creatures now infesting the cathedral.

3366
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:50,200
He went quickly and without much of a struggle.

3367
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:52,020
Okay.

3368
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,340
I guess it's good that we...

3369
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:56,980
Oh my god!

3370
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:59,720
Oh my

3371
02:37:08,670 --> 02:37:09,390
gosh!

3372
02:37:09,450 --> 02:37:10,350
He's leaping again.

3373
02:37:10,970 --> 02:37:12,210
Leaping and jumping and...

3374
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:17,540
Yeah!

3375
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:19,180
Take him down, Peter!

3376
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:21,060
Peter Owens!

3377
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:26,980
Yeah!

3378
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:29,480
Don't mind my sanity.

3379
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:31,560
I'm fine.

3380
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:33,000
I'm...

3381
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:33,860
Fine.

3382
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:36,660
Can I play the organ now?

3383
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:38,780
Yippee!

3384
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:39,540
Oh!

3385
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:40,300
What's here, actually?

3386
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:45,100
A piece of very old paper sits on the pipe organ.

3387
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:47,060
Callously misplaced and forgotten.

3388
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:49,880
Sheep music.

3389
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:53,660
Gotta play.

3390
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:54,860
The shelling is on.

3391
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:56,440
The shelling has knocked out the cathedral's generator.

3392
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:58,140
The organ cannot be used without a...

3393
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,520
We saw that before.

3394
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:02,780
The generator.

3395
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:05,660
I thought the power was gonna go out in the chapter that we...

3396
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:07,100
With the monk.

3397
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:08,740
And that we were gonna have to turn it on.

3398
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:09,660
But we turn it on here.

3399
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:12,260
Interesting.

3400
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:12,740
Interesting.

3401
02:38:14,980 --> 02:38:16,940
The organ cannot be used without a power...

3402
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:17,520
A supply of power.

3403
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:18,700
It can be properly...

3404
02:38:18,700 --> 02:38:20,720
It can probably be used if power is restored.

3405
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:25,700
A.

3406
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:25,900
B.

3407
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:26,100
Y.

3408
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,080
X.

3409
02:38:35,710 --> 02:38:36,370
Petty time.

3410
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:40,110
I don't think there was a generator in the...

3411
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:40,330
Oh!

3412
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:40,790
It was a...

3413
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,550
Wait.

3414
02:38:41,650 --> 02:38:42,370
No, there was something.

3415
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:44,330
Maybe it wasn't the monk.

3416
02:38:44,430 --> 02:38:45,170
Which one was it?

3417
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:48,730
It was a bellows.

3418
02:38:48,810 --> 02:38:49,230
There was...

3419
02:38:49,230 --> 02:38:49,790
There was a...

3420
02:38:49,790 --> 02:38:50,510
There was one, though.

3421
02:38:50,590 --> 02:38:50,970
I remember.

3422
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:52,090
Oh!

3423
02:38:52,870 --> 02:38:53,270
Hello?

3424
02:38:55,670 --> 02:38:57,490
Did I just miss this completely before?

3425
02:38:57,690 --> 02:38:58,090
Or...

3426
02:38:59,430 --> 02:38:59,930
Um...

3427
02:39:17,900 --> 02:39:18,400
One...

3428
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:18,700
Two...

3429
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:18,980
Three...

3430
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:19,280
Four...

3431
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:19,660
Five...

3432
02:39:19,660 --> 02:39:19,960
Six...

3433
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:20,240
Seven?

3434
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:21,960
Uh-oh.

3435
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,020
Peter, we're not strong enough yet.

3436
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:25,720
Seven?

3437
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:28,580
I guess that makes sense.

3438
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:29,980
There's like two other slots.

3439
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:33,840
Yeah, we need a seven-point spell.

3440
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,160
I am going to...

3441
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:37,140
Sorry.

3442
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:40,160
I know you guys are like, let your sanity get low.

3443
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:45,140
But I also don't want to die, so...

3444
02:39:45,140 --> 02:39:45,900
Oh!

3445
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:46,420
Are you okay?

3446
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:49,460
Oh...

3447
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:52,480
One of the cathedral's guards lies dead by his post.

3448
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,480
His death was sudden and violent.

3449
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:59,500
His broken limbs twisted at odd angles with the trickle of blood issuing from his mouth and ears.

3450
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:01,820
I don't know if that's fine.

3451
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:05,020
Could be.

3452
02:40:05,860 --> 02:40:06,840
It's not safe.

3453
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:08,580
Wait, why not?

3454
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:09,400
What's in here?

3455
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:12,860
What's in here still that could get me?

3456
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:14,780
If anything?

3457
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:15,880
I don't know.

3458
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:17,700
Hmm.

3459
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:21,480
There's more bone thieves?

3460
02:40:21,980 --> 02:40:23,100
Wouldn't they have come up to...

3461
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:26,160
I didn't

3462
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:39,740
see that guy at all!

3463
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:41,740
Oh my god!

3464
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:43,680
Now can I save?

3465
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:45,100
Oh...

3466
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:47,060
Well, I guess the other guy from the bed, huh?

3467
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:55,820
Oh, it's the war.

3468
02:40:57,880 --> 02:40:59,260
Oh, that scared me.

3469
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,120
That scared me!

3470
02:41:06,930 --> 02:41:08,270
This is where we came from, right?

3471
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:12,790
It's so dark.

3472
02:41:13,050 --> 02:41:14,150
Okay, here we can save.

3473
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,460
Check out my bones.

3474
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:20,400
My bones are fine.

3475
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:21,340
Probably.

3476
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:26,020
Santa, you know what you take when a bone thief...

3477
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:29,280
breaks out is a massive?

3478
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:30,780
Yeah!

3479
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:33,080
It's alive.

3480
02:41:34,220 --> 02:41:35,840
Is there anyone else in here then?

3481
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:38,140
Oh my gosh, that guy was just standing there.

3482
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:39,240
Really scared me.

3483
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:42,840
He really freaked me out.

3484
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:46,060
Do you think this guy is down?

3485
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,080
Do you think he's going to stand up?

3486
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:50,080
Bone thief?

3487
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:51,140
No, okay.

3488
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:53,520
Okay.

3489
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:55,540
Oh, let's open that thing too.

3490
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:57,080
I forgot about this one over here.

3491
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:02,160
Never mind.

3492
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:03,520
Doesn't matter.

3493
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:04,940
Oh my gosh.

3494
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:07,260
Gosh, I can't get over that guy just standing there.

3495
02:42:09,860 --> 02:42:11,300
How much it scared me.

3496
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:21,890
I heard whispers...

3497
02:42:23,890 --> 02:42:24,790
What is that?

3498
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:28,590
What is that?

3499
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:34,330
What is...

3500
02:42:34,330 --> 02:42:35,110
There is a lot going on.

3501
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:36,750
What is going on here?

3502
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:42,780
Oh!

3503
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:44,140
I'll pick it up!

3504
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:46,140
Oh, the torch!

3505
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:47,240
You guys are so right.

3506
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:48,460
Please, I forgot about it.

3507
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:49,580
Ah.

3508
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:52,000
Yes, oh, oh, oh wait.

3509
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,400
Wait, is this a...examined?

3510
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:10,340
Guess we don't...we only care about some letters, but not all.

3511
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:11,320
What is that?

3512
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:12,520
Oh, it's a lamp!

3513
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:17,260
Anybody in here?

3514
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:27,000
You got little pieces of meat on the shelf?

3515
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:29,440
Come in!

3516
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:33,820
The desk kept meticulously clean.

3517
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:37,260
Peter is surprised that it is not more chaotic for a frontline hospital.

3518
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:40,660
After all, isn't this where the death certificates are written?

3519
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,020
Maybe they don't even write them.

3520
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:49,200
What if they don't even write them?

3521
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,000
You know?

3522
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:52,780
What if they're just like, yeah, you're dead.

3523
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:04,520
I hear footsteps.

3524
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:07,480
But...when I stop walking.

3525
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,660
So this is the generator.

3526
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:19,700
The workings of the pipe organ have remained mostly the same since installation.

3527
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:23,280
Originally the bellows were...yeah, the bellows were driven manually.

3528
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:27,200
Now they are steam-powered and the organ controlled electrically.

3529
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:30,640
This might be one of the oldest restored pipe organs in the world.

3530
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:32,980
This might be one of the oldest restored pipe organs in the world.

3531
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,660
It's a bomb, this place.

3532
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:35,760
It's fancy.

3533
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,980
How do I turn it on?

3534
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:41,460
Fix it, Peter.

3535
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:42,160
Fix it.

3536
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:44,100
Peter, we need to play the organ.

3537
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:45,860
You have to get it.

3538
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:53,200
No, don't worry about it.

3539
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:54,420
Hi, Minto.

3540
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:54,820
Hello!

3541
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:03,150
Nice.

3542
02:45:04,130 --> 02:45:06,230
Thanks for five bucks, the sniper.

3543
02:45:06,930 --> 02:45:07,990
Thank you.

3544
02:45:12,210 --> 02:45:15,210
I don't have...a crossbow.

3545
02:45:16,690 --> 02:45:18,030
Oh, but I have a gun!

3546
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:19,710
How could I forget my gun?

3547
02:45:25,230 --> 02:45:26,010
Oh, wait.

3548
02:45:26,130 --> 02:45:27,290
I don't...I should...no.

3549
02:45:27,430 --> 02:45:29,290
Equip the gun, not the...the...

3550
02:45:31,250 --> 02:45:31,790
Forget

3551
02:45:34,890 --> 02:45:35,510
my gun!

3552
02:45:38,870 --> 02:45:40,270
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3553
02:45:40,690 --> 02:45:41,350
Thank you.

3554
02:45:41,810 --> 02:45:44,710
Oh my gosh, the thrill of reloading in battle.

3555
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:47,130
I've never felt anything like this before.

3556
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:57,880
So it is one-shot.

3557
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:05,220
Oh!

3558
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:06,920
This is pretty spooky.

3559
02:46:11,740 --> 02:46:12,960
If I could see...

3560
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:12,980
Oh!

3561
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:13,720
That would be great.

3562
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:16,340
There we go.

3563
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:19,700
When he, like, kind of lowers his gun a little bit, I know...

3564
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:24,520
Come on.

3565
02:46:25,660 --> 02:46:26,180
Come on.

3566
02:46:38,850 --> 02:46:40,190
Oh, there's a lot of doors in here.

3567
02:46:40,350 --> 02:46:40,530
Okay.

3568
02:46:40,570 --> 02:46:41,770
Let's go to the right.

3569
02:46:43,730 --> 02:46:44,090
Oh!

3570
02:46:47,830 --> 02:46:48,190
What?

3571
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:52,650
Don't mind the ceiling, okay, guys?

3572
02:46:54,730 --> 02:46:58,630
Perched on the wall beside the generator is an open-facing fuse box.

3573
02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:00,030
A fuse appears to be missing.

3574
02:47:00,190 --> 02:47:01,350
There's no sign of where it could be.

3575
02:47:01,510 --> 02:47:02,110
Oh my gosh.

3576
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:05,490
This is like every indie horror game ever.

3577
02:47:05,850 --> 02:47:07,070
You have to find it.

3578
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:10,230
You have to find a fuse for a thing?

3579
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:13,610
Indie game...

3580
02:47:13,610 --> 02:47:16,090
Indie horror game developers love that.

3581
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:17,570
Oh.

3582
02:47:19,010 --> 02:47:19,530
Whoa.

3583
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:20,890
Oh.

3584
02:47:20,890 --> 02:47:22,970
We never got to go in any of these places.

3585
02:47:23,070 --> 02:47:23,890
There's a whole little hole!

3586
02:47:24,210 --> 02:47:24,650
Wait.

3587
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:27,130
I can summon a thing and go in there.

3588
02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:32,370
Old, rusty, crusty, but faithful for many years to coal-burning boiler...

3589
02:47:32,370 --> 02:47:32,770
Wait.

3590
02:47:32,910 --> 02:47:37,190
A coal-burning boiler provides heat and steam to the cathedral complex.

3591
02:47:37,490 --> 02:47:39,950
There's currently no pressure being diverted to the generator.

3592
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:41,870
Should Peter turn the wheel?

3593
02:47:44,550 --> 02:47:45,630
Will it explode?

3594
02:47:46,910 --> 02:47:47,930
Um, hold on.

3595
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:50,310
Wait a second.

3596
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:51,890
I gotta...

3597
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:03,100
Yes.

3598
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:14,300
We're safe.

3599
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:15,500
Oh, this is another door.

3600
02:48:16,480 --> 02:48:17,300
What the heck?

3601
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:20,020
This place has turned into so much more of a maze than before.

3602
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,820
I'm going to spell.

3603
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,140
I'm going to summon a little trapper.

3604
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:29,520
Here we go.

3605
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:30,060
Oh.

3606
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:31,020
He's right there.

3607
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:33,720
All right.

3608
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:34,200
Let's go.

3609
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:42,520
Oh, there's a thing here.

3610
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:43,800
There's a person?

3611
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:45,340
The body of a soldier.

3612
02:48:46,020 --> 02:48:49,320
A patient from the hospital lies slumped against the door.

3613
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:53,140
Ah, so we wouldn't even be able to go in here because he's blocking the door.

3614
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:56,880
It's the seven point.

3615
02:48:56,940 --> 02:48:57,100
Yeah.

3616
02:48:58,040 --> 02:49:02,540
Trying to hide from the horror, he had barricaded himself inside the room before succumbing to his wounds.

3617
02:49:04,180 --> 02:49:04,620
Oh.

3618
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:05,360
Oh.

3619
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:06,140
Oh.

3620
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:07,380
Ooh.

3621
02:49:12,650 --> 02:49:13,790
All right, little guy.

3622
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:15,170
You can leave.

3623
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:18,930
Because I don't want to kill you.

3624
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:25,150
This room is used to store coal for use in the steam boiler that powers the cathedral's generator.

3625
02:49:29,350 --> 02:49:30,210
Teleport him out?

3626
02:49:30,410 --> 02:49:31,010
What do you mean?

3627
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:38,690
Small piles are all that's left, and with the almost endless war, a resupply is a long way off.

3628
02:49:39,130 --> 02:49:39,610
Oh.

3629
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:43,460
Can I actually get him?

3630
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:46,240
Wait, how do I use the power?

3631
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:06,920
Oh, I have to target it first.

3632
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:08,280
Got it.

3633
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:08,680
Hold on.

3634
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:10,540
I'm gonna heal a little bit.

3635
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:19,310
I should probably just use like a sanity focus thing on him.

3636
02:50:20,050 --> 02:50:20,750
Okay, hold on.

3637
02:50:23,690 --> 02:50:24,130
Okay.

3638
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:26,990
We're gonna get that guy.

3639
02:50:27,050 --> 02:50:27,550
We're gonna take him.

3640
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:28,490
We're gonna take him to another world.

3641
02:50:31,650 --> 02:50:32,290
Lalalala.

3642
02:50:32,650 --> 02:50:40,370
So, I press L to target him, and then I take him to a new world.

3643
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:41,710
I take him to a whole new world.

3644
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:46,550
I can show you par gone.

3645
02:50:58,550 --> 02:50:59,190
Ooh,

3646
02:51:06,350 --> 02:51:07,310
par gone.

3647
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:10,690
Okay.

3648
02:51:10,750 --> 02:51:11,390
Okay, little guy.

3649
02:51:14,310 --> 02:51:15,230
Okay, here we go.

3650
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:16,750
So then I...

3651
02:51:19,070 --> 02:51:20,330
Then he dies!

3652
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:23,410
Poor thing.

3653
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:25,430
I was attached to him.

3654
02:51:25,710 --> 02:51:27,530
Okay, it's so loud in here, my goodness.

3655
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:29,390
Bye!

3656
02:51:31,970 --> 02:51:35,670
A circle of power sits atop a stack of crates in the middle of the room!

3657
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:45,380
Circle of power...

3658
02:51:51,580 --> 02:51:54,260
So how many park guns do I add now?

3659
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:55,760
Wait!

3660
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:58,480
I made my head for only five!

3661
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:01,420
And now you're telling me I have seven?

3662
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,660
I have to redo my whole gig!

3663
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:05,880
I have to redo my whole outfit!

3664
02:52:07,420 --> 02:52:08,560
Wait a second!

3665
02:52:11,340 --> 02:52:12,320
Just leave.

3666
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:13,480
Just leave, Peter.

3667
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,880
Sorry, I'm like trying to get back my magic.

3668
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:29,640
So like enchant, I...

3669
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:30,080
Oh, hold on.

3670
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:30,480
Check.

3671
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:32,560
I need...

3672
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:35,400
Enter Buck and Magor More.

3673
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:42,900
Enter Buck.

3674
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,040
And Magor More.

3675
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:50,040
And then park gun, park gun, park gun, park gun!

3676
02:53:03,060 --> 02:53:04,460
No way!

3677
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,440
Park

3678
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:11,800
gun!

3679
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:13,940
I'll check.

3680
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:17,640
Narrow Cough and Sun Talk.

3681
02:53:24,060 --> 02:53:25,180
Sun Talk.

3682
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:27,260
Narrow Talk.

3683
02:53:29,020 --> 02:53:29,720
Wait.

3684
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:31,760
Narrow Cough.

3685
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:33,340
Park gun, park gun.

3686
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:34,720
Park gun, park gun.

3687
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:36,320
Park gun, park gun.

3688
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:41,260
I can't believe!

3689
02:53:42,440 --> 02:53:47,620
Wait, so for each more that you get, you just keep adding park guns?

3690
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:48,740
That's actually...

3691
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:53,480
The runes you need are drawn on the scroll.

3692
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:56,200
Yeah, they are.

3693
02:53:56,420 --> 02:54:00,600
But I am better with remembering the names.

3694
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:04,560
Okay, this one is Narrow Cough and Red Goremore.

3695
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:05,740
Narrow Cough.

3696
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:18,610
Narrow Cough.

3697
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:19,110
Narrow Cough.

3698
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:20,930
Narrow Cough.

3699
02:54:20,930 --> 02:54:23,270
And Red Goremore, I think it was.

3700
02:54:25,450 --> 02:54:25,870
Yeah.

3701
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:34,520
Park gun, park gun.

3702
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:39,560
As a member of the ancient esoteric magical order, I can confirm, we just add more park gun.

3703
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,820
Park gun, park gun.

3704
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,220
Oh.

3705
02:54:45,100 --> 02:54:45,700
What the?

3706
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,300
Oh, that's just coal on the ground.

3707
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:52,140
Well, now we can do that thing.

3708
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,660
Dispel magic.

3709
02:54:56,660 --> 02:54:57,220
Shield?

3710
02:54:57,400 --> 02:54:58,700
Let's do shield as well.

3711
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:03,020
Let's do all the powerful things that I'll use pretty quickly.

3712
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:05,500
Bancorok and Sontok.

3713
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,220
Bancorok.

3714
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:10,160
Bancorok.

3715
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:12,000
Bancorok.

3716
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:13,680
And Sontok.

3717
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:17,360
And then Paragon, Paragon, Paragon, Paragon.

3718
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,880
If I try it with summon...

3719
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:25,320
We're not gonna know what we summon though.

3720
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:25,900
Not yet.

3721
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:27,240
When in doubt, Paragon.

3722
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:28,720
Are we gonna summon...

3723
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:30,600
that creature?

3724
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:33,200
Wait, what else will we summon?

3725
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:37,580
Try it?

3726
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:39,060
I'm scared.

3727
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:42,740
I'm guessing...

3728
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:46,760
Either the guy with the wings...

3729
02:55:47,880 --> 02:55:48,320
or...

3730
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:49,880
the really big guy.

3731
02:55:54,690 --> 02:55:56,770
You're too Paragon to help.

3732
02:56:01,370 --> 02:56:02,210
We'll do it later.

3733
02:56:02,330 --> 02:56:02,790
We'll do it later.

3734
02:56:02,830 --> 02:56:04,710
I wanna see if I get a thing first, you know?

3735
02:56:06,590 --> 02:56:08,030
By thing, I mean like a...

3736
02:56:09,030 --> 02:56:09,470
Codex.

3737
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:12,170
I would like a Codex.

3738
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:13,750
Oh, okay.

3739
02:56:14,070 --> 02:56:14,650
I can't...

3740
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:23,660
Oh, my sanity!

3741
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:29,080
I can't... I can't leave.

3742
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:35,040
Oh my god.

3743
02:56:35,820 --> 02:56:37,080
Oh my god.

3744
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:40,160
Freaked me out.

3745
02:56:41,140 --> 02:56:41,900
Oh, whoops.

3746
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:48,340
Save and continue.

3747
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:49,680
That was cool.

3748
02:56:49,780 --> 02:56:50,960
I like that one a lot actually.

3749
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:53,440
Really like that one.

3750
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:58,080
Oh, it's this one.

3751
02:56:58,340 --> 02:56:58,780
Again.

3752
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:01,220
We've heard...

3753
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:01,920
We heard this one earlier.

3754
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:05,180
A soldier's body lies on the floor, far from the front line.

3755
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:06,740
This poor man met his end.

3756
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:09,480
His fate is far removed from his brothers in arms.

3757
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:13,200
A victim of the cathedral, rather than by bullet or bayonet.

3758
02:57:14,100 --> 02:57:14,780
Oh my gosh.

3759
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:15,200
Raiders!

3760
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:15,520
Ah!

3761
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,140
I didn't see who it was, but thank you!

3762
02:57:18,940 --> 02:57:19,380
Hello!

3763
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:21,380
Miri Raids.

3764
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:21,580
Hello!

3765
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:22,660
Hi, everybody.

3766
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:23,980
We're playing a crazy game.

3767
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:24,580
Oh my gosh.

3768
02:57:24,580 --> 02:57:26,240
If you're like, I don't know what's going on.

3769
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:27,700
Just think Paragon.

3770
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:29,820
Thanks for the ride!

3771
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:32,640
Cask's full of maturing wine.

3772
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:35,860
Do we need to do the one that's like...

3773
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:37,080
Oh, these have wine in them.

3774
02:57:37,240 --> 02:57:39,640
Admit the rates of the cold air when the war is over.

3775
02:57:39,720 --> 02:57:40,700
If it is ever...

3776
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:43,780
Or if it ever is, the wine will be a good vintage.

3777
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:44,980
I guess.

3778
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:45,820
TF2.

3779
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:46,680
Thanks for the 5k.

3780
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:51,880
We're going a little crazy.

3781
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:53,640
So if you're like, wow.

3782
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:54,560
This is...

3783
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:57,580
What's happening with your screen?

3784
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:02,180
It's like just that.

3785
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:04,400
Okay.

3786
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:05,800
So we redirected...

3787
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:07,320
This rat looks so funny.

3788
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:12,320
We redirected to that generator too.

3789
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:13,720
I don't know if it did anything.

3790
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:20,680
Going a little crazy.

3791
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:23,860
Our sanity is the green meter.

3792
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:25,620
It's quite low.

3793
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:27,180
We just had our limbs cut off.

3794
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:29,300
But it was our imagination.

3795
02:58:31,980 --> 02:58:33,040
It wasn't real.

3796
02:58:33,400 --> 02:58:34,780
It's just our imagination.

3797
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:43,720
All right.

3798
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:44,440
Let's open this thing.

3799
02:58:51,580 --> 02:58:52,060
Reveal.

3800
02:58:57,080 --> 02:58:57,560
Park.

3801
02:58:58,600 --> 02:58:59,080
Park.

3802
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:00,640
Park.

3803
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:01,540
Park.

3804
02:59:01,640 --> 02:59:02,040
Park.

3805
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:02,280
Park.

3806
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:02,500
Park.

3807
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:03,620
Park.

3808
02:59:04,980 --> 02:59:05,440
What?

3809
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:10,800
An odd collection of color lines decorate the wall.

3810
02:59:10,900 --> 02:59:13,840
Below the design steps appear to lead up to the wall going nowhere.

3811
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:21,180
Oh, it's red.

3812
02:59:24,400 --> 02:59:31,380
I always forget which ones are the ones that are supposed to be the same color and which is the ones that are supposed to be the opposite color.

3813
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:34,700
Red dispel.

3814
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:35,860
I don't think it's dispel magic.

3815
02:59:35,880 --> 02:59:36,240
Is it?

3816
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:36,860
Oh, maybe.

3817
02:59:37,360 --> 02:59:38,540
Oh, I didn't do this one.

3818
02:59:38,620 --> 02:59:38,880
Hold on.

3819
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:41,980
Nethlek.

3820
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:43,060
Red Gormor.

3821
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:44,640
Nethlek.

3822
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:46,360
Nethlek.

3823
02:59:47,800 --> 02:59:48,320
Nethlek.

3824
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:53,540
Red Gormor?

3825
02:59:56,120 --> 02:59:56,900
Where is it?

3826
02:59:57,760 --> 02:59:58,280
Oh.

3827
03:00:00,580 --> 03:00:01,460
Is it this one?

3828
03:00:07,170 --> 03:00:07,690
Yes.

3829
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:11,270
It's the one that we don't have identity.

3830
03:00:11,270 --> 03:00:11,450
Oh.

3831
03:00:11,470 --> 03:00:11,970
Defied.

3832
03:00:12,590 --> 03:00:13,410
Right?

3833
03:00:15,190 --> 03:00:16,570
I think.

3834
03:00:20,030 --> 03:00:21,670
Red Gormor.

3835
03:00:22,130 --> 03:00:23,150
And then?

3836
03:00:23,270 --> 03:00:24,150
Question mark?

3837
03:00:24,530 --> 03:00:25,350
Probably.

3838
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:31,610
The dispel.

3839
03:00:31,610 --> 03:00:32,690
Magic spell.

3840
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:33,850
Yeah.

3841
03:00:35,730 --> 03:00:37,290
Yeah, I missed it.

3842
03:00:37,410 --> 03:00:37,950
It's okay, though.

3843
03:00:38,270 --> 03:00:39,430
It's all good.

3844
03:00:39,650 --> 03:00:39,870
Oh.

3845
03:00:40,310 --> 03:00:41,010
And then?

3846
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:41,450
Let's see.

3847
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:41,770
Let's do it.

3848
03:00:42,530 --> 03:00:43,750
It's either the reveal.

3849
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:46,810
I feel like it's reveal invisible, but we'll try both.

3850
03:00:51,050 --> 03:00:51,810
We'll try both.

3851
03:00:54,710 --> 03:00:55,610
Red Gormor.

3852
03:00:55,690 --> 03:00:56,170
Bar God.

3853
03:00:56,310 --> 03:00:56,890
Bar God.

3854
03:00:56,990 --> 03:00:57,490
Bar God.

3855
03:00:58,170 --> 03:00:58,650
See?!

3856
03:00:59,230 --> 03:01:00,750
I knew it was reveal!

3857
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:03,030
I knew it.

3858
03:01:03,050 --> 03:01:03,730
I knew it.

3859
03:01:03,750 --> 03:01:04,110
I knew it.

3860
03:01:04,130 --> 03:01:04,630
I called it.

3861
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:06,690
I knew it.

3862
03:01:06,830 --> 03:01:08,050
I knew it.

3863
03:01:08,070 --> 03:01:09,170
I knew it.

3864
03:01:09,170 --> 03:01:09,470
I knew it.

3865
03:01:11,230 --> 03:01:12,850
Park on, park on.

3866
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:33,460
There seems to be no way to open it.

3867
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:33,700
Oh.

3868
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:35,740
Well, great.

3869
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:41,100
Calm down, Peter.

3870
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:41,300
Peter.

3871
03:01:43,380 --> 03:01:45,820
Are there any more guys in here?

3872
03:01:45,900 --> 03:01:46,220
I'm scared.

3873
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:48,120
Any more guys?

3874
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:52,240
I'm hyping myself up.

3875
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:53,860
The handle!

3876
03:01:53,900 --> 03:01:54,920
Let's take the one...

3877
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:57,960
Remember we saw that glowing thing in the...

3878
03:01:57,960 --> 03:02:00,820
I saw a glowing thing in the...

3879
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:02,000
That bell room.

3880
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:03,100
It might be...

3881
03:02:03,100 --> 03:02:09,530
It was this way.

3882
03:02:11,070 --> 03:02:13,010
If I remember correctly.

3883
03:02:14,550 --> 03:02:15,670
Let's equip our...

3884
03:02:16,570 --> 03:02:17,670
sword real quick.

3885
03:02:20,610 --> 03:02:21,430
She's just...

3886
03:02:21,430 --> 03:02:23,630
I'm blocking her, but there's just a lady standing there.

3887
03:02:28,650 --> 03:02:29,690
I've got a fever.

3888
03:02:29,790 --> 03:02:31,550
And the only prescription is more Pargon.

3889
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:45,360
Oh my god.

3890
03:02:45,400 --> 03:02:46,700
My sanity is completely gone.

3891
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:47,900
Finish him!

3892
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,180
Yeah, good job, Peter.

3893
03:02:52,260 --> 03:02:53,940
I am gonna restore some sanity.

3894
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:58,260
I can do it.

3895
03:02:58,280 --> 03:02:59,480
A little sanity as a treat.

3896
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:05,020
A little sanity as a treat.

3897
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:06,880
What's this?

3898
03:03:07,720 --> 03:03:09,040
Oh, I think it's just lighting.

3899
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:13,600
Oh!

3900
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:14,520
Alex.

3901
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:14,680
Alex.

3902
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:19,680
So basically for anybody coming in and like, what's going on?

3903
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:19,900
So basically for anybody coming in and like, what's going on?

3904
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:22,640
We're this girl reading about the stuff that we're playing.

3905
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:22,880
We're this girl reading about the stuff that we're playing.

3906
03:03:23,060 --> 03:03:23,560
Essentially.

3907
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:26,380
Ah, sweet Alex.

3908
03:03:26,380 --> 03:03:28,820
And our grandpa's kind of weird.

3909
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:29,900
I don't like it.

3910
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:32,680
Many centuries I've waited for you.

3911
03:03:32,740 --> 03:03:33,080
Wait, what?

3912
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:34,860
You are mine.

3913
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:38,380
Don't disappoint me now.

3914
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:39,660
What?

3915
03:03:39,860 --> 03:03:42,400
I've waited for you for such a long time, Alex.

3916
03:03:43,240 --> 03:03:43,800
Never!

3917
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:46,240
I know what you are.

3918
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:48,180
I've seen what happened.

3919
03:03:48,520 --> 03:03:50,380
Wait, grandpa is looking different a little bit.

3920
03:03:53,220 --> 03:03:53,780
Grandpa...

3921
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:54,780
Grandpa...

3922
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:55,480
Oh my god!

3923
03:03:55,700 --> 03:03:59,860
You can try to fight me, but in the end you shall succumb to my desires.

3924
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:01,440
You can try to fight me, but in the end you shall succumb to my desires.

3925
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:02,020
Yeah, it's pious.

3926
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:06,600
You don't even know your own destiny.

3927
03:04:06,600 --> 03:04:06,760
You don't even know your own destiny.

3928
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:09,700
Get away from me.

3929
03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:10,640
Get away from me.

3930
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:11,360
Yeah, go away grandpa.

3931
03:04:15,540 --> 03:04:16,680
What if that's his name?

3932
03:04:16,980 --> 03:04:18,860
This isn't really happening!

3933
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:21,200
What if his name is grandpa?

3934
03:04:21,460 --> 03:04:22,420
And you're just like, get away grandpa!

3935
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:24,240
He's like, how do you know my name?

3936
03:04:29,380 --> 03:04:30,280
Anything in here?

3937
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:31,560
It's not.

3938
03:04:31,720 --> 03:04:32,100
Alright.

3939
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:36,120
Okay.

3940
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:38,200
Just gotta go up here.

3941
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:40,660
I was gonna say it's quiet in here.

3942
03:04:41,500 --> 03:04:42,840
But it's not quite quiet.

3943
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:43,940
Okay.

3944
03:04:43,960 --> 03:04:45,020
Oh my gosh.

3945
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:48,560
You weren't in here...

3946
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:50,000
What are you?

3947
03:04:53,280 --> 03:04:55,060
Oh my gosh, it's a blue thing.

3948
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:01,080
Okay.

3949
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:05,080
Actually, there's no handle here.

3950
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:06,840
Just kidding.

3951
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:09,180
I guess we don't...

3952
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:10,840
Blue bone thief.

3953
03:05:10,940 --> 03:05:13,720
Oh my gosh, it's our first time seeing a blue bone thief.

3954
03:05:19,620 --> 03:05:21,240
Oh, I didn't do that.

3955
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:22,700
That actually wasn't me.

3956
03:05:23,060 --> 03:05:23,440
It's Peter!

3957
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:26,200
Peter, don't just do that!

3958
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:28,500
Peter!

3959
03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:35,940
Aw, that poor...

3960
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:37,580
nurse was just trying to hide.

3961
03:05:43,490 --> 03:05:45,370
If I were a handle...

3962
03:05:47,130 --> 03:05:48,150
Where would I be?

3963
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:52,760
Let's check this...

3964
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:54,920
Oh wait, we already went in the storage area.

3965
03:05:55,640 --> 03:05:56,740
That's where we got the gun.

3966
03:05:59,060 --> 03:05:59,980
Can we go outside?

3967
03:06:01,960 --> 03:06:06,380
Although scared enough to run, the journalist in Peter is determined to uncover the full story of the cathedral.

3968
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:07,820
No matter what it entails.

3969
03:06:08,140 --> 03:06:10,180
To the bloody end, Peter decides to stay.

3970
03:06:10,340 --> 03:06:11,540
Peter, you're going to die!

3971
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:20,680
Oh gosh, it's so dark in here.

3972
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:24,560
Oh gosh.

3973
03:06:24,740 --> 03:06:28,460
Oh my gosh!

3974
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:29,400
The poster changed!

3975
03:06:31,960 --> 03:06:32,440
Freaky!

3976
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:34,460
Wait!

3977
03:06:34,660 --> 03:06:35,600
I'm fat?

3978
03:06:37,140 --> 03:06:38,600
Oh, your fate!

3979
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:58,330
I didn't even use the right your if they were going to say you're fat.

3980
03:07:09,070 --> 03:07:10,490
Oh my goodness.

3981
03:07:10,490 --> 03:07:12,590
That got me good.

3982
03:07:12,810 --> 03:07:14,070
I'm glad we went in here.

3983
03:07:24,370 --> 03:07:26,250
Roasted by a low sanity poster.

3984
03:07:26,710 --> 03:07:27,170
Truly.

3985
03:07:31,640 --> 03:07:32,740
A handle.

3986
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:36,100
I hear something.

3987
03:07:41,010 --> 03:07:42,710
Oh my gosh, it's like a lady screaming.

3988
03:07:43,050 --> 03:07:43,710
It's freaky.

3989
03:07:43,710 --> 03:07:43,790
It's freaky.

3990
03:07:47,990 --> 03:07:49,950
Where have we not been to?

3991
03:07:51,210 --> 03:07:52,590
To find a handle.

3992
03:08:02,100 --> 03:08:03,300
To find a handle.

3993
03:08:05,100 --> 03:08:05,700
Ah!

3994
03:08:07,100 --> 03:08:08,820
This can't be happening!

3995
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,580
We tried to open the menu.

3996
03:08:11,600 --> 03:08:13,000
The penny is the key.

3997
03:08:13,420 --> 03:08:14,320
The penny.

3998
03:08:18,980 --> 03:08:22,000
Whoever holds the penny will undoubtedly receive good fortune.

3999
03:08:22,980 --> 03:08:23,980
The penny.

4000
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:24,680
The penny is the key.

4001
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:31,440
No, I'm not done with the generator, but I don't know if I can do any more with it.

4002
03:08:35,960 --> 03:08:37,280
We can go downstairs and check.

4003
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:40,780
Is there anything that I could insert the penny into?

4004
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:48,100
Sanity recovering IRL.

4005
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:52,100
I'm fine.

4006
03:08:53,500 --> 03:08:54,020
Maybe...

4007
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:59,580
A small metallic object.

4008
03:09:00,960 --> 03:09:02,360
Is this the fuse box?

4009
03:09:02,660 --> 03:09:03,300
With the penny?

4010
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:05,760
Wait, where was the fuse box?

4011
03:09:08,260 --> 03:09:09,780
Oh, we would need a fuse.

4012
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:10,440
Right?

4013
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:21,660
I would not have gotten that.

4014
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:22,740
Oh my... what?

4015
03:09:23,580 --> 03:09:28,000
In a rush of inventiveness, Peter jams the lucky penny in place of the fuse.

4016
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:30,840
I would not have...

4017
03:09:31,340 --> 03:09:31,780
Yawn!

4018
03:09:31,780 --> 03:09:32,320
Welcome to membership.

4019
03:09:32,520 --> 03:09:32,960
Thank you.

4020
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:33,520
No.

4021
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:34,700
I would...

4022
03:09:35,140 --> 03:09:35,360
What?

4023
03:09:36,740 --> 03:09:38,960
Peter jams the lucky penny in place of the fuse.

4024
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:40,000
Amazingly, it works.

4025
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:40,940
The fuse has been replaced.

4026
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:48,260
On the wall beside the generator is an open-faced fuse box.

4027
03:09:48,380 --> 03:09:50,180
There's a lucky penny jammed in place.

4028
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:53,920
A dangerous fix, but enough to bring power to the circuit.

4029
03:09:57,280 --> 03:09:57,960
Okay.

4030
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:00,680
Huh?

4031
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:09,510
Yeah, that's not a typical indie game type fuse.

4032
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:10,170
For real.

4033
03:10:11,830 --> 03:10:12,510
Mute?

4034
03:10:14,590 --> 03:10:16,810
This can't be happening!

4035
03:10:16,930 --> 03:10:21,050
I love the meta sanity things.

4036
03:10:22,390 --> 03:10:23,070
Thank you.

4037
03:10:23,970 --> 03:10:25,030
It's making me hungry.

4038
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:25,790
I should get a chicken.

4039
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:27,250
A chicken sandwich with paragon cheese.

4040
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:32,430
How do I get the fuse to turn on?

4041
03:10:32,930 --> 03:10:34,650
It says it's delivering...

4042
03:10:36,490 --> 03:10:38,070
It says it's delivering...

4043
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:43,030
Power, but how do I turn it on now?

4044
03:10:44,070 --> 03:10:44,870
Wait, here?

4045
03:10:45,170 --> 03:10:45,690
No.

4046
03:10:54,710 --> 03:10:56,550
Shame the system is locked behind copyright.

4047
03:10:56,830 --> 03:11:05,910
I think last time I played people said that the copyright for it is going to expire soon.

4048
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:07,270
Or has already expired.

4049
03:11:08,330 --> 03:11:09,130
Like, recently.

4050
03:11:09,970 --> 03:11:10,950
Yeah, the patent expired.

4051
03:11:11,270 --> 03:11:11,470
Yeah.

4052
03:11:12,550 --> 03:11:14,410
For kids at home, don't do this.

4053
03:11:14,990 --> 03:11:15,390
Yeah.

4054
03:11:16,110 --> 03:11:18,270
It did say it was a dangerous fix.

4055
03:11:18,850 --> 03:11:22,610
The generator has a steady supply of steam and all the circuits appear to be intact.

4056
03:11:22,850 --> 03:11:23,290
Oh, here it is.

4057
03:11:23,370 --> 03:11:24,950
There is a lever to switch on the generator.

4058
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:25,550
Okay, here we go.

4059
03:11:25,770 --> 03:11:26,910
Pull the lever, Peter.

4060
03:11:27,030 --> 03:11:27,430
Wait.

4061
03:11:27,510 --> 03:11:29,090
Pull the lever, Peter.

4062
03:11:33,730 --> 03:11:34,230
Whoa!

4063
03:11:36,350 --> 03:11:37,230
Oh, my game.

4064
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:37,950
Whoa.

4065
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:38,810
Whoa.

4066
03:11:39,710 --> 03:11:40,210
Whoa.

4067
03:11:42,050 --> 03:11:43,410
Let there be light!

4068
03:11:44,250 --> 03:11:44,670
Peep.

4069
03:11:44,890 --> 03:11:46,050
I didn't say peep.

4070
03:11:47,090 --> 03:11:48,470
Maybe I did say peep.

4071
03:11:49,070 --> 03:11:50,530
Did I say peep on accident?

4072
03:11:51,910 --> 03:11:53,290
And now this should be working?

4073
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:56,090
The workings of the pipe?

4074
03:11:56,210 --> 03:11:56,390
Yeah.

4075
03:11:56,570 --> 03:11:58,370
Okay, let's go try our pipe organ.

4076
03:12:05,560 --> 03:12:06,660
I'm so sick of the bombing.

4077
03:12:07,060 --> 03:12:07,540
Sounds!

4078
03:12:15,320 --> 03:12:16,160
Oh, my God.

4079
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:21,440
I'm glad we have good shoes.

4080
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:24,320
Kind of ASMR.

4081
03:12:28,060 --> 03:12:29,500
I just heard something.

4082
03:12:33,140 --> 03:12:34,100
Is someone coming?

4083
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:35,280
Over here?

4084
03:12:36,540 --> 03:12:37,220
Where is that?

4085
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:37,900
Ah!

4086
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:38,500
Ah!

4087
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:39,340
Oh, my gosh.

4088
03:12:40,900 --> 03:12:41,880
Where did you come from?

4089
03:12:43,400 --> 03:12:44,500
Oh, I should have...

4090
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:45,220
Oh, no.

4091
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:45,580
My sanity.

4092
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:46,400
Oh, no.

4093
03:12:46,460 --> 03:12:46,780
My sanity.

4094
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:48,780
Come on, Peter.

4095
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:50,120
Peter, we gotta make it.

4096
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:50,640
Peter.

4097
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:51,000
Peter.

4098
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:51,640
Peter!

4099
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:52,300
Peter.

4100
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:52,820
Shit.

4101
03:12:53,800 --> 03:12:54,120
Ah!

4102
03:12:54,500 --> 03:12:54,820
Peter!

4103
03:13:01,720 --> 03:13:02,040
Oh.

4104
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:02,680
Ah!

4105
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:04,000
There's more of them.

4106
03:13:05,140 --> 03:13:05,600
Finish them.

4107
03:13:08,580 --> 03:13:09,300
Run away, Peter.

4108
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:10,220
Peter, run away.

4109
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:11,080
Peter, run away!

4110
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:14,680
What the?

4111
03:13:16,420 --> 03:13:17,060
What's going on?

4112
03:13:19,100 --> 03:13:19,620
Oh.

4113
03:13:20,060 --> 03:13:20,920
What is this?

4114
03:13:20,980 --> 03:13:22,080
What is this sanity effect?

4115
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:24,140
What's happening?

4116
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:25,600
Oh.

4117
03:13:27,420 --> 03:13:27,940
Oh.

4118
03:13:28,020 --> 03:13:28,560
I can't.

4119
03:13:28,560 --> 03:13:29,020
I can't.

4120
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:32,400
I can't do anything.

4121
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:33,700
Like, no menus or anything.

4122
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:35,660
What's this sanity effect?

4123
03:13:38,100 --> 03:13:38,620
Oh.

4124
03:13:40,400 --> 03:13:41,440
What is happening?

4125
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:44,720
What if I go back downstairs?

4126
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:45,280
Ah!

4127
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:47,060
Ah!

4128
03:13:48,300 --> 03:13:50,080
Okay, now we can do it.

4129
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:53,260
Recover.

4130
03:13:53,260 --> 03:13:53,820
Cast.

4131
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:56,080
A lot of sanity.

4132
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:00,980
We went to another time.

4133
03:14:02,960 --> 03:14:03,520
Whoa!

4134
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:04,640
It filled us.

4135
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:05,640
It topped us off, baby.

4136
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:07,700
Alright, now we can fight this guy.

4137
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:08,500
Oh.

4138
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:12,860
I'm ready to kill you.

4139
03:14:13,580 --> 03:14:14,140
I'm ready to kill you.

4140
03:14:16,020 --> 03:14:16,700
Finish him?

4141
03:14:20,220 --> 03:14:20,740
Ah!

4142
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:21,500
Shoot!

4143
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:22,660
Oh, my health.

4144
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:26,260
Run, Peter, run!

4145
03:14:27,100 --> 03:14:27,840
Oh, no.

4146
03:14:27,900 --> 03:14:28,280
My health.

4147
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:29,720
It's actually so bad.

4148
03:14:31,980 --> 03:14:33,360
Maybe I should have healed that too.

4149
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:34,480
Oh!

4150
03:14:34,980 --> 03:14:36,260
This camera angle.

4151
03:14:40,240 --> 03:14:40,760
Recover.

4152
03:14:40,960 --> 03:14:41,340
Cast.

4153
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:42,620
Health.

4154
03:14:48,460 --> 03:14:49,140
Recover.

4155
03:14:49,140 --> 03:14:49,820
Cast.

4156
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:50,920
Health.

4157
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:51,040
Recover.

4158
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:51,600
Cast.

4159
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:51,600
Health.

4160
03:14:51,900 --> 03:14:52,580
Recover.

4161
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:52,580
Cast.

4162
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:52,580
Health.

4163
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:53,500
Okay, are we good now?

4164
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:56,700
Any other bone stealers about?

4165
03:14:59,240 --> 03:14:59,920
Maybe.

4166
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:02,960
But we still have an organ to play.

4167
03:15:03,320 --> 03:15:03,500
But we still have an organ to play.

4168
03:15:05,960 --> 03:15:08,460
A, B, Y, X!

4169
03:15:08,780 --> 03:15:08,820
A, B, Y, X!

4170
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:09,760
G?

4171
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:09,820
G?

4172
03:15:12,660 --> 03:15:13,980
G?

4173
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:22,530
Play the organ?

4174
03:15:22,670 --> 03:15:22,870
Yes.

4175
03:15:23,190 --> 03:15:24,010
Oh!

4176
03:15:24,190 --> 03:15:24,570
Oh!

4177
03:15:24,730 --> 03:15:24,910
Oh!

4178
03:15:24,930 --> 03:15:29,710
A, B, Y, X!

4179
03:15:30,910 --> 03:15:31,570
B!

4180
03:15:37,500 --> 03:15:38,820
Y!

4181
03:15:39,580 --> 03:15:40,700
A!

4182
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:47,900
I used deductive math.

4183
03:15:47,900 --> 03:15:48,700
I used deductive math.

4184
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:51,780
The handle!

4185
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:57,880
What are you staring at, Peter?

4186
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:02,620
When you run over there, it freaks me out.

4187
03:16:04,540 --> 03:16:06,520
The tabernacle is almost empty.

4188
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:08,500
Empty of all the things that should be there.

4189
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:11,160
Such as holy water or other ritualistic items.

4190
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:12,760
Such as holy water or other ritualistic items.

4191
03:16:13,900 --> 03:16:16,160
There's only a door handle lying on the lower shelf.

4192
03:16:16,780 --> 03:16:18,000
Take the door handle!

4193
03:16:19,180 --> 03:16:20,060
Take the door handle!

4194
03:16:20,060 --> 03:16:22,300
I'm gonna go back to the basement real quick.

4195
03:16:23,500 --> 03:16:24,140
I'm gonna go back to the basement real quick.

4196
03:16:24,140 --> 03:16:25,300
Probably like, why are you going back to the basement?

4197
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:25,700
Probably like, why are you going back to the basement?

4198
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:27,340
Cause I wanna save the game.

4199
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:42,120
Yeah, the paragon is strengthening my brain.

4200
03:16:42,240 --> 03:16:44,400
Yeah, the paragon is strengthening my brain.

4201
03:16:44,400 --> 03:16:44,780
I never would have...

4202
03:16:45,280 --> 03:16:47,160
I never would have thought of the penny.

4203
03:16:50,060 --> 03:16:51,520
Oh, it's so bright in here now.

4204
03:16:55,700 --> 03:16:56,160
Please!

4205
03:16:57,340 --> 03:16:58,920
Please stop the...

4206
03:17:00,120 --> 03:17:01,460
The bombing sounds!

4207
03:17:01,580 --> 03:17:01,980
Please!

4208
03:17:07,890 --> 03:17:08,770
Oh, what's that?

4209
03:17:10,330 --> 03:17:12,110
Is that a hole in the ground?

4210
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:15,710
What are you staring at, Peter?

4211
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:17,070
Wake up.

4212
03:17:18,190 --> 03:17:19,190
I'm in the shun.

4213
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:21,070
I'm in the shun.

4214
03:17:31,140 --> 03:17:31,700
Boar.

4215
03:17:32,860 --> 03:17:36,100
Maybe the deeper we go, the less we hear it.

4216
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:38,560
Ooh.

4217
03:17:44,580 --> 03:17:47,280
Should we be using PPPH before the spell?

4218
03:17:48,220 --> 03:17:51,320
Or before the paragon chat starts?

4219
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:54,420
Hmm...

4220
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:56,540
Umm...

4221
03:17:58,680 --> 03:17:59,620
Probably...

4222
03:17:59,620 --> 03:18:02,060
Before the paragon chat starts.

4223
03:18:03,250 --> 03:18:04,960
I think the paragon...

4224
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:06,660
Is...

4225
03:18:06,660 --> 03:18:10,220
I think paragon is used for the chorus.

4226
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:12,260
Ah!

4227
03:18:14,340 --> 03:18:15,420
What the?

4228
03:18:15,580 --> 03:18:16,660
Oh my god!

4229
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:17,900
Ah!

4230
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:20,360
Ah!

4231
03:18:22,760 --> 03:18:25,420
They break out into little bone men!

4232
03:18:33,350 --> 03:18:34,010
Oh my gosh.

4233
03:18:34,270 --> 03:18:35,210
I'm hitting the...

4234
03:18:35,730 --> 03:18:36,130
Please!

4235
03:18:36,710 --> 03:18:37,430
Oh my gosh.

4236
03:18:37,570 --> 03:18:38,570
Wait, this is so bad.

4237
03:18:38,650 --> 03:18:39,450
I was hitting the sta...

4238
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:40,470
I can't even get a...

4239
03:18:40,930 --> 03:18:43,330
Peter, this is bad.

4240
03:18:43,670 --> 03:18:44,730
Peter, this is really bad.

4241
03:18:47,170 --> 03:18:48,130
Oh my gosh.

4242
03:18:48,230 --> 03:18:49,170
I couldn't even move!

4243
03:18:49,470 --> 03:18:50,990
They just completely cornered me!

4244
03:18:55,570 --> 03:18:56,530
This is so messed up!

4245
03:18:58,210 --> 03:18:58,650
Peter!

4246
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:03,040
Wow.

4247
03:19:04,040 --> 03:19:05,480
They... They got me good.

4248
03:19:05,660 --> 03:19:07,100
They really got me good.

4249
03:19:08,820 --> 03:19:10,660
Shieldman... I couldn't have done anything though!

4250
03:19:10,800 --> 03:19:11,320
I couldn't have.

4251
03:19:11,460 --> 03:19:13,920
They would've attacked me and then I couldn't do anything.

4252
03:19:15,200 --> 03:19:16,880
I didn't know that that was gonna happen.

4253
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:20,040
Alright.

4254
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:22,260
Seven point red shield.

4255
03:19:22,400 --> 03:19:24,020
That's exactly what I was gonna do.

4256
03:19:25,640 --> 03:19:26,520
That's exactly...

4257
03:19:26,520 --> 03:19:27,660
I was gonna do that.

4258
03:19:27,680 --> 03:19:27,980
I was gonna do that.

4259
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:28,740
I was gonna enchant my sword.

4260
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:30,240
We're gonna go in.

4261
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:31,060
We're gonna be ready.

4262
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:33,820
Okay.

4263
03:19:35,960 --> 03:19:36,380
Spell.

4264
03:19:36,380 --> 03:19:37,160
Enchant item.

4265
03:19:37,400 --> 03:19:37,820
Cast.

4266
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:39,060
Red.

4267
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:39,900
Onto my sword.

4268
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:51,180
That's so loud.

4269
03:19:51,260 --> 03:19:51,600
Hold on.

4270
03:19:51,820 --> 03:19:53,160
Turn it down just a little bit more.

4271
03:19:53,280 --> 03:19:53,440
Okay.

4272
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:53,520
Okay.

4273
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:55,740
Okay.

4274
03:19:58,500 --> 03:19:58,980
Alright.

4275
03:19:59,140 --> 03:20:00,000
And now shield.

4276
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:03,740
Red shield.

4277
03:20:07,560 --> 03:20:08,040
Wait.

4278
03:20:08,120 --> 03:20:09,120
Wouldn't it be a green shield?

4279
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:12,180
No.

4280
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:12,820
You do opposite.

4281
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:13,780
Gosh.

4282
03:20:14,520 --> 03:20:15,000
Wait.

4283
03:20:15,080 --> 03:20:15,300
Right?

4284
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:21,240
Oh my god.

4285
03:20:21,280 --> 03:20:21,580
Turn around!

4286
03:20:36,970 --> 03:20:38,130
I need to take down the...

4287
03:20:38,130 --> 03:20:40,610
I need to take down the bone things before...

4288
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:42,590
before I take down the zombies.

4289
03:20:43,350 --> 03:20:44,370
Oh this guy is...

4290
03:20:44,370 --> 03:20:44,790
Oh.

4291
03:20:44,970 --> 03:20:45,490
Never mind.

4292
03:20:46,250 --> 03:20:47,130
Are you getting in him?

4293
03:20:47,310 --> 03:20:48,330
Are you getting inside that guy?

4294
03:20:48,550 --> 03:20:48,750
Ah!

4295
03:21:01,100 --> 03:21:01,460
Yeah.

4296
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:02,420
Take that!

4297
03:21:06,250 --> 03:21:06,610
Oh.

4298
03:21:06,630 --> 03:21:07,690
And I hit the stairs again.

4299
03:21:08,770 --> 03:21:09,270
Finish him!

4300
03:21:10,370 --> 03:21:10,930
Oh my god.

4301
03:21:11,030 --> 03:21:11,170
Ah!

4302
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:11,670
Ah!

4303
03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:14,850
Finish him!

4304
03:21:16,750 --> 03:21:17,110
Finish him!

4305
03:21:17,110 --> 03:21:18,430
I could have torch this guy, I guess.

4306
03:21:19,410 --> 03:21:20,130
I could have torch this guy, I guess.

4307
03:21:20,130 --> 03:21:20,850
Don't finish him, I guess.

4308
03:21:23,710 --> 03:21:24,070
Yeah.

4309
03:21:25,970 --> 03:21:26,610
Oh my gosh.

4310
03:21:26,670 --> 03:21:28,090
I keep hitting the stairs.

4311
03:21:28,450 --> 03:21:28,870
Come up here.

4312
03:21:29,930 --> 03:21:30,590
Can you not?

4313
03:21:30,690 --> 03:21:31,230
Are you too big?

4314
03:21:33,490 --> 03:21:34,510
Are you too big for this?

4315
03:21:36,650 --> 03:21:37,010
Okay.

4316
03:21:37,050 --> 03:21:37,490
We got him.

4317
03:21:38,410 --> 03:21:38,770
Whoa!

4318
03:21:38,770 --> 03:21:38,970
Whoa!

4319
03:21:44,820 --> 03:21:45,620
Whoa to mix?

4320
03:21:45,740 --> 03:21:46,040
Whoa!

4321
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:48,700
Enchanted shotguns too?

4322
03:21:49,080 --> 03:21:50,540
Oh if I like...

4323
03:21:50,540 --> 03:21:50,900
Otage?

4324
03:21:52,220 --> 03:21:53,720
Well that... Oh maybe.

4325
03:21:53,940 --> 03:21:54,960
It counts as like a mix.

4326
03:21:55,300 --> 03:21:55,600
Mmm.

4327
03:21:55,780 --> 03:21:56,420
I see.

4328
03:21:56,460 --> 03:21:56,620
I see.

4329
03:21:57,020 --> 03:21:57,640
Oh yeah.

4330
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:58,820
I didn't even need the gun.

4331
03:21:58,900 --> 03:21:59,340
It's crazy.

4332
03:21:59,740 --> 03:22:01,480
I like the sword actually a whole lot.

4333
03:22:03,520 --> 03:22:05,400
Cause I don't have to think about reloading.

4334
03:22:05,560 --> 03:22:05,860
Hahaha.

4335
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:09,360
Green shield protects from sanity drop.

4336
03:22:09,400 --> 03:22:09,980
Red protects health.

4337
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:12,020
Blue protects magic loss.

4338
03:22:12,300 --> 03:22:12,900
I don't think I have to think about reloading.

4339
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:13,980
Any normal enemy does this.

4340
03:22:14,060 --> 03:22:14,240
Purple?

4341
03:22:14,380 --> 03:22:14,500
Oh.

4342
03:22:18,420 --> 03:22:18,780
Oh.

4343
03:22:18,780 --> 03:22:19,320
My bad.

4344
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:22,880
Remember this area?

4345
03:22:24,740 --> 03:22:27,920
I hear... I can't tell if it's the ceiling or a guy that I'm hearing.

4346
03:22:28,320 --> 03:22:29,000
Is he a rat?

4347
03:22:34,960 --> 03:22:36,500
Even these guys are still here.

4348
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:36,840
Okay.

4349
03:22:36,860 --> 03:22:37,900
Maybe I do need my gun.

4350
03:22:40,320 --> 03:22:40,680
Hahaha.

4351
03:22:45,500 --> 03:22:47,500
Thank you for playing Eternal Darkness!

4352
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:48,260
It's been a fun ride!

4353
03:22:48,500 --> 03:22:49,380
It's also my birthday!

4354
03:22:49,580 --> 03:22:50,320
Deep woof!

4355
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:54,340
Can I do your song in a deep way?

4356
03:22:56,240 --> 03:22:59,100
Happy birthday to you!

4357
03:22:59,540 --> 03:23:00,140
Woof!

4358
03:23:00,540 --> 03:23:03,480
Happy birthday to you!

4359
03:23:03,860 --> 03:23:04,460
Woof!

4360
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:07,380
Happy birthday to you!

4361
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:07,640
Happy birthday dear Deep!

4362
03:23:07,860 --> 03:23:08,420
Woof!

4363
03:23:09,640 --> 03:23:12,640
Happy birthday to you!

4364
03:23:12,700 --> 03:23:12,900
Woof!

4365
03:23:14,060 --> 03:23:14,660
Woof!

4366
03:23:14,960 --> 03:23:15,340
Woof!

4367
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:17,160
Happy birthday!

4368
03:23:19,370 --> 03:23:20,830
Thank you for the super chat!

4369
03:23:22,470 --> 03:23:25,710
I'm just gonna do purple and see if it'll poison him.

4370
03:23:30,210 --> 03:23:31,230
Deep woof!

4371
03:23:31,850 --> 03:23:32,090
Deep woof!

4372
03:23:32,350 --> 03:23:33,610
Oh my god.

4373
03:23:35,090 --> 03:23:36,810
How's my sanity?

4374
03:23:37,030 --> 03:23:37,630
It's okay.

4375
03:23:38,350 --> 03:23:39,210
Let's go in.

4376
03:23:43,390 --> 03:23:44,290
Oh my god.

4377
03:23:49,770 --> 03:23:50,330
Please.

4378
03:23:50,410 --> 03:23:50,670
Please.

4379
03:23:50,770 --> 03:23:51,570
Attack him.

4380
03:23:51,750 --> 03:23:53,270
Instead of the small guys.

4381
03:24:01,580 --> 03:24:03,280
I have one bullet left.

4382
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:06,400
Oh!

4383
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:08,680
Oh my gosh.

4384
03:24:08,680 --> 03:24:08,940
Oh my gosh.

4385
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:09,320
We took him out!

4386
03:24:11,180 --> 03:24:12,100
Easy, baby!

4387
03:24:13,660 --> 03:24:14,500
Equip the sword.

4388
03:24:14,740 --> 03:24:15,680
And finish him.

4389
03:24:16,520 --> 03:24:17,200
Finish him?

4390
03:24:17,720 --> 03:24:18,280
Hiyah!

4391
03:24:19,100 --> 03:24:19,660
Hiyah!

4392
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:22,600
What?

4393
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:25,340
This is where we sacrificed that guy.

4394
03:24:27,320 --> 03:24:28,360
Sorry, monk.

4395
03:24:29,180 --> 03:24:30,380
Sorry, other monk.

4396
03:24:31,860 --> 03:24:36,280
I love having guns and swords.

4397
03:24:36,380 --> 03:24:37,300
And torches.

4398
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:42,420
And shields.

4399
03:24:46,540 --> 03:24:47,300
I

4400
03:24:58,260 --> 03:24:59,300
meant to reload.

4401
03:25:01,960 --> 03:25:03,840
I shot that guy, but I didn't die.

4402
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:08,720
Yeah, I love having everything that I need.

4403
03:25:09,440 --> 03:25:10,340
Maybe he did die.

4404
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:14,500
I'm just too good at this game.

4405
03:25:16,340 --> 03:25:17,980
He fights much better than Roberto.

4406
03:25:18,300 --> 03:25:18,700
Seriously.

4407
03:25:18,720 --> 03:25:20,200
They were like, okay, we know.

4408
03:25:20,260 --> 03:25:22,580
We gave you a really hard time that...

4409
03:25:24,160 --> 03:25:24,560
Hello?

4410
03:25:32,910 --> 03:25:33,710
Finish him!

4411
03:25:34,510 --> 03:25:36,190
They were like, we gave you such a hard time.

4412
03:25:36,270 --> 03:25:36,650
We gave you such a hard time with Roberto.

4413
03:25:36,850 --> 03:25:39,630
We're gonna give you Peter who's just a total badass.

4414
03:25:41,650 --> 03:25:43,130
He's really good at his job.

4415
03:25:45,410 --> 03:25:46,190
What is this?

4416
03:25:46,310 --> 03:25:47,290
Oh, is this a soldier's letter?

4417
03:25:48,530 --> 03:25:51,330
A tattered letter lies forgotten on the chair.

4418
03:25:53,210 --> 03:25:53,690
Okay.

4419
03:25:54,550 --> 03:25:56,530
Sometimes the wording in this game...

4420
03:25:56,530 --> 03:25:59,750
Okay, just because something is like left in a place doesn't mean it's forgotten.

4421
03:26:00,350 --> 03:26:04,170
Like otherwise, everything in my room would be forgotten.

4422
03:26:04,530 --> 03:26:05,950
Because I put it somewhere.

4423
03:26:05,950 --> 03:26:08,350
That doesn't mean it's a forgotten letter.

4424
03:26:08,630 --> 03:26:11,930
It's just a letter placed on the trunk.

4425
03:26:12,550 --> 03:26:14,150
It's like...

4426
03:26:16,230 --> 03:26:17,950
It's a forgotten sock.

4427
03:26:18,670 --> 03:26:20,530
A long forgotten sock.

4428
03:26:20,930 --> 03:26:23,370
Wait, why are you both mentioning a sock?

4429
03:26:24,290 --> 03:26:24,730
Huh?

4430
03:26:25,170 --> 03:26:26,550
Forgotten laundry pile?

4431
03:26:26,790 --> 03:26:26,970
No!

4432
03:26:27,810 --> 03:26:29,350
I do my laundry.

4433
03:26:29,650 --> 03:26:30,610
Soldier's letter.

4434
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:33,670
Let's check it out.

4435
03:26:34,230 --> 03:26:35,290
Number three.

4436
03:26:36,110 --> 03:26:37,170
Number three.

4437
03:26:38,010 --> 03:26:38,830
Soldier's letter.

4438
03:26:39,770 --> 03:26:41,030
Forgotten s'mores supplies.

4439
03:26:41,130 --> 03:26:41,530
No!

4440
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:47,830
Third letter from Private Reginald Jackson to his love Margaret.

4441
03:26:48,170 --> 03:26:51,210
It's been two weeks since Haskell went missing.

4442
03:26:51,410 --> 03:26:53,030
And I'm afraid to go to sleep.

4443
03:26:53,630 --> 03:26:56,890
More than once I saw shadows of people moving past my bed.

4444
03:26:57,070 --> 03:27:01,150
Peeking through the blinds to see a wounded soldier being taken from his bed.

4445
03:27:01,670 --> 03:27:04,010
Drugged and delirious in the dead of the night.

4446
03:27:04,170 --> 03:27:05,790
Never to be seen again.

4447
03:27:05,790 --> 03:27:07,730
Oh my gosh, we're gonna lose this war.

4448
03:27:09,010 --> 03:27:11,970
As Haskell was, perhaps as I will be.

4449
03:27:12,310 --> 03:27:14,170
What happened to them, I don't know.

4450
03:27:14,770 --> 03:27:17,410
A Metal Gear Rex figure abandoned for aeons.

4451
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:20,170
It's actually a Metal Gear Rex box.

4452
03:27:22,570 --> 03:27:24,450
Because it's not constructed yet.

4453
03:27:27,970 --> 03:27:32,850
I'm afraid to ask what happened, for I know that I would surely be the next one to be taken into the darkness.

4454
03:27:34,110 --> 03:27:37,410
We're gonna lose this war because our men keep being kidnapped.

4455
03:27:39,750 --> 03:27:42,050
The shelf appears to be recessed into the wall.

4456
03:27:42,170 --> 03:27:43,490
Not quite as flushed as the others.

4457
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:45,590
Almost as if it could slide inward.

4458
03:27:46,470 --> 03:27:47,010
Push it.

4459
03:27:47,090 --> 03:27:48,050
Yeah, in a second.

4460
03:27:51,390 --> 03:27:52,290
Let me save.

4461
03:27:54,170 --> 03:27:55,290
She does her laundry.

4462
03:27:55,370 --> 03:27:58,830
She just leaves it on the floor on $20 Amazon for...

4463
03:27:58,830 --> 03:27:59,210
What?

4464
03:27:59,270 --> 03:28:00,410
What are you talking about?

4465
03:28:06,940 --> 03:28:08,980
You've gone too far!

4466
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:16,340
Just because my dresser was $20 from Amazon means I'm being frugal.

4467
03:28:16,680 --> 03:28:18,120
And it's not even on the floor.

4468
03:28:18,240 --> 03:28:19,220
It's a dresser!

4469
03:28:22,020 --> 03:28:25,380
Yeah, even Peter is like, what's wrong?

4470
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:26,380
What are you talking about?

4471
03:28:31,450 --> 03:28:32,410
It works.

4472
03:28:32,470 --> 03:28:33,790
It's literally a dresser.

4473
03:28:33,870 --> 03:28:36,750
And also, I need to get a new one anyway because I'm out of space.

4474
03:28:37,150 --> 03:28:39,150
Because I didn't get one that's big enough.

4475
03:28:47,910 --> 03:28:50,950
What's wrong with my $20 dresser?

4476
03:28:52,090 --> 03:28:52,970
Did I save?

4477
03:28:53,370 --> 03:28:54,350
I think I did.

4478
03:28:58,030 --> 03:28:59,730
Push the shelf, Peter!

4479
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:09,200
I'm just going to shoot this little creature right there.

4480
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:14,080
Oh, that's a rat.

4481
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:16,280
I almost shot you, rat.

4482
03:29:17,380 --> 03:29:18,440
I almost shot the rat?

4483
03:29:22,650 --> 03:29:23,190
Good.

4484
03:29:23,430 --> 03:29:23,970
Onwards.

4485
03:29:29,840 --> 03:29:31,040
You think he's going to...

4486
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:31,720
Yes!

4487
03:29:34,060 --> 03:29:34,860
Oh my gosh.

4488
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:35,640
Oh my gosh.

4489
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:36,200
Oh my gosh.

4490
03:29:36,400 --> 03:29:36,940
Creature.

4491
03:29:37,860 --> 03:29:38,400
Critter.

4492
03:29:39,620 --> 03:29:41,180
Grown-up dresser funds!

4493
03:29:42,300 --> 03:29:44,920
Oh, I can finish him.

4494
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:45,780
Hold on.

4495
03:29:47,860 --> 03:29:48,520
Finish him.

4496
03:29:49,900 --> 03:29:51,780
It's a still grown-up dresser!

4497
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:54,300
It looks fun.

4498
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:55,580
It's just cheap.

4499
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:58,660
Oh, his whole body...

4500
03:30:01,320 --> 03:30:05,600
A key lies upon this accursed shrine, glinting in the soft candlelight.

4501
03:30:06,120 --> 03:30:08,080
Oh, but this is not a forgotten key.

4502
03:30:09,900 --> 03:30:11,260
Binding hall key.

4503
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:13,600
Hall?

4504
03:30:14,860 --> 03:30:15,460
Well...

4505
03:30:16,200 --> 03:30:17,360
I guess we'll...

4506
03:30:19,800 --> 03:30:22,360
If it's cheap and too small, that's a kid's dresser.

4507
03:30:22,380 --> 03:30:22,580
No!

4508
03:30:22,580 --> 03:30:25,520
I just have too many clothes!

4509
03:30:29,600 --> 03:30:35,780
I recently got like a bunch of pajamas that are like really big and fluffy, so they don't fit.

4510
03:30:36,220 --> 03:30:36,960
You know?

4511
03:30:39,460 --> 03:30:41,220
It's hard to fold them up.

4512
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:49,720
Open the door.

4513
03:30:57,970 --> 03:30:58,510
Alrighty.

4514
03:30:58,510 --> 03:31:00,090
We came through this door.

4515
03:31:00,390 --> 03:31:01,150
We probably...

4516
03:31:01,150 --> 03:31:02,190
Can we go through this one?

4517
03:31:02,390 --> 03:31:02,930
Oh.

4518
03:31:04,890 --> 03:31:05,530
Uh...

4519
03:31:06,210 --> 03:31:06,850
Okay.

4520
03:31:07,690 --> 03:31:08,870
There's a door over here, yeah.

4521
03:31:08,990 --> 03:31:10,030
Okay, let's save again.

4522
03:31:11,630 --> 03:31:13,410
The meta is just save scumming.

4523
03:31:16,950 --> 03:31:18,650
It's forgotten large pajamas.

4524
03:31:19,910 --> 03:31:20,550
Oh.

4525
03:31:21,610 --> 03:31:22,250
Uh...

4526
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:23,590
Use?

4527
03:31:23,810 --> 03:31:24,750
Can I use?

4528
03:31:25,090 --> 03:31:26,070
Use here?

4529
03:31:28,650 --> 03:31:29,810
Can use here!

4530
03:31:30,990 --> 03:31:31,630
Wait.

4531
03:31:33,310 --> 03:31:33,830
Huh?

4532
03:31:35,830 --> 03:31:36,350
Oh.

4533
03:31:36,490 --> 03:31:37,150
That was weird.

4534
03:31:37,870 --> 03:31:38,390
Yeah,

4535
03:31:41,750 --> 03:31:42,010
dummy.

4536
03:31:49,250 --> 03:31:50,690
Oh, my sanity.

4537
03:31:51,410 --> 03:31:52,410
My sanity.

4538
03:31:52,510 --> 03:31:53,990
Okay, let's get a little bit sanity back.

4539
03:31:56,330 --> 03:31:58,390
Let's get a little bit sanity back.

4540
03:31:59,910 --> 03:32:00,770
It's not...

4541
03:32:00,770 --> 03:32:01,970
They're not even that like...

4542
03:32:01,970 --> 03:32:03,790
Luckily, they're not even so like warm.

4543
03:32:03,950 --> 03:32:04,870
They're just like...

4544
03:32:04,870 --> 03:32:06,710
I don't know, they're just poofy.

4545
03:32:09,750 --> 03:32:10,310
Perfect.

4546
03:32:12,730 --> 03:32:13,290
Alright.

4547
03:32:16,030 --> 03:32:17,230
Oh, this is...

4548
03:32:17,230 --> 03:32:18,610
We're going deep, guys.

4549
03:32:18,690 --> 03:32:19,470
We're going downtown.

4550
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:20,130
What's that?

4551
03:32:21,530 --> 03:32:22,090
Oh!

4552
03:32:22,170 --> 03:32:22,730
Ammunition!

4553
03:32:23,970 --> 03:32:28,810
I know we're only reaching spooky month, but have you heard about the Christmas Metal Gear Solid game?

4554
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:30,610
I have heard about it!

4555
03:32:30,870 --> 03:32:32,650
We should play it this Christmas alone.

4556
03:32:33,890 --> 03:32:34,690
Oh my god!

4557
03:32:49,070 --> 03:32:50,970
So I'll have to miss your birthday.

4558
03:32:51,130 --> 03:32:51,350
No!

4559
03:32:52,010 --> 03:32:53,370
I'll be back in a couple of months.

4560
03:32:53,450 --> 03:32:55,830
I'll make sure to remember the basics of CQC.

4561
03:32:56,070 --> 03:32:57,650
Just like you taught me, boss!

4562
03:32:57,970 --> 03:32:58,830
Happy birthday!

4563
03:33:01,650 --> 03:33:02,890
Oh my gosh.

4564
03:33:02,890 --> 03:33:06,470
This music... is so fitting.

4565
03:33:07,570 --> 03:33:09,390
Stay loyal to the mission, yeah?

4566
03:33:10,130 --> 03:33:11,930
Remember the basics of CQC!

4567
03:33:13,670 --> 03:33:14,670
I believe in you!

4568
03:33:16,850 --> 03:33:18,350
Don't be like these guys, okay?

4569
03:33:18,390 --> 03:33:18,730
They suck.

4570
03:33:22,270 --> 03:33:26,350
Don't find any... any... bone snatchers now, you hear?

4571
03:33:27,530 --> 03:33:29,170
A scroll sits on a small...

4572
03:33:29,170 --> 03:33:29,550
Ooh!

4573
03:33:30,990 --> 03:33:32,750
Magical attack spell!

4574
03:33:34,930 --> 03:33:35,530
Whoa!

4575
03:33:38,490 --> 03:33:40,030
Did we know this one already?

4576
03:33:42,410 --> 03:33:43,010
Yeah!

4577
03:33:43,190 --> 03:33:44,130
The spell nine!

4578
03:33:44,970 --> 03:33:45,270
Oh!

4579
03:33:45,330 --> 03:33:45,790
My bad.

4580
03:33:48,270 --> 03:33:49,350
We knew this one.

4581
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:57,110
But now I can actually do it with five Paragons and seven Paragons.

4582
03:33:58,610 --> 03:33:59,450
Check it out!

4583
03:33:59,870 --> 03:34:00,750
Let's see...

4584
03:34:00,750 --> 03:34:01,530
Antorbock!

4585
03:34:01,670 --> 03:34:02,550
Red Gormor.

4586
03:34:08,100 --> 03:34:08,580
Antorbock.

4587
03:34:10,580 --> 03:34:11,060
Antorbock.

4588
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:12,800
Red Gormor.

4589
03:34:13,540 --> 03:34:14,020
Paragon!

4590
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:14,320
Paragon!

4591
03:34:14,480 --> 03:34:14,720
Oh!

4592
03:34:14,740 --> 03:34:14,960
No!

4593
03:34:15,060 --> 03:34:15,400
No!

4594
03:34:15,480 --> 03:34:15,840
Oh!

4595
03:34:15,860 --> 03:34:16,400
There we go.

4596
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:16,820
Paragon!

4597
03:34:16,920 --> 03:34:17,240
Paragon!

4598
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:20,000
Ha!

4599
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:20,220
Ha!

4600
03:34:20,220 --> 03:34:20,380
Ha!

4601
03:34:24,500 --> 03:34:25,460
New spell.

4602
03:34:28,760 --> 03:34:29,180
Paragon!

4603
03:34:29,300 --> 03:34:29,580
Paragon!

4604
03:34:29,700 --> 03:34:30,000
Paragon!

4605
03:34:30,100 --> 03:34:30,380
Paragon!

4606
03:34:32,400 --> 03:34:33,240
Red Gormor.

4607
03:34:33,980 --> 03:34:34,400
Antorbock.

4608
03:34:37,720 --> 03:34:39,300
It even comments why it's there.

4609
03:34:39,440 --> 03:34:40,220
Wait, did it actually say?

4610
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:41,420
I think I missed that part.

4611
03:34:44,320 --> 03:34:44,740
Alright.

4612
03:34:44,980 --> 03:34:45,200
Cool!

4613
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:48,440
Please save before continuing.

4614
03:34:49,080 --> 03:34:50,260
Way ahead of you, buddy.

4615
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:51,580
Uh-oh.

4616
03:34:51,720 --> 03:34:52,500
What's in there?

4617
03:34:53,820 --> 03:34:54,240
Um...

4618
03:34:55,020 --> 03:34:55,820
What's in there?

4619
03:35:01,100 --> 03:35:01,900
What's in there?

4620
03:35:02,840 --> 03:35:04,060
What should I enchant?

4621
03:35:04,340 --> 03:35:04,900
My sword?

4622
03:35:05,020 --> 03:35:05,200
My...

4623
03:35:05,200 --> 03:35:06,100
My...

4624
03:35:06,100 --> 03:35:07,920
I guess we'll go see.

4625
03:35:17,660 --> 03:35:18,220
What's here?

4626
03:35:18,740 --> 03:35:24,100
The corridor is ended by an elaborate door decorated in a manner which is much different than the others within the cathedral.

4627
03:35:24,380 --> 03:35:26,760
Peter senses an unbearable evil beyond the door.

4628
03:35:27,320 --> 03:35:33,700
When he reaches it to open it, fear creeps into his gut and begins to eat at his soul.

4629
03:35:33,980 --> 03:35:34,200
Oh!

4630
03:35:35,280 --> 03:35:37,160
Is this the boss?

4631
03:35:37,580 --> 03:35:38,920
Is this the final boss?

4632
03:35:45,220 --> 03:35:45,740
Oh!

4633
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:48,120
Oh my god!

4634
03:35:50,320 --> 03:35:50,840
Wait!

4635
03:35:51,260 --> 03:35:52,400
This is where his head exploded!

4636
03:35:52,840 --> 03:35:53,600
Oh my gosh!

4637
03:35:53,860 --> 03:35:55,400
This is where the monk's head exploded.

4638
03:35:55,400 --> 03:35:55,940
Oh!

4639
03:35:56,020 --> 03:35:56,140
Oh!

4640
03:35:56,140 --> 03:35:56,360
Wait!

4641
03:35:56,500 --> 03:35:57,920
I'm not fighting this thing yet, am I?

4642
03:35:58,100 --> 03:35:58,800
No way!

4643
03:35:59,800 --> 03:36:00,760
What if I die?

4644
03:36:01,060 --> 03:36:01,640
That's like...

4645
03:36:01,640 --> 03:36:02,540
I mean...

4646
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:03,840
No way.

4647
03:36:08,260 --> 03:36:09,900
I'm not fighting this thing yet, right?

4648
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:12,580
What is this?

4649
03:36:12,580 --> 03:36:13,320
There's fly sounds.

4650
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:14,440
Nasty.

4651
03:36:16,980 --> 03:36:17,500
Oh!

4652
03:36:17,820 --> 03:36:18,340
Pinschers!

4653
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:22,320
Yeah...

4654
03:36:23,720 --> 03:36:24,240
Hello!

4655
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:25,520
Wow!

4656
03:36:26,440 --> 03:36:26,960
Oh!

4657
03:36:27,220 --> 03:36:27,520
Oh!

4658
03:36:28,220 --> 03:36:28,840
Hi!

4659
03:36:32,280 --> 03:36:32,900
Yeah!

4660
03:36:33,160 --> 03:36:33,940
Take him!

4661
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:34,960
Get him, Peter!

4662
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:44,280
What are you doing?

4663
03:36:45,620 --> 03:36:46,240
Oh!

4664
03:36:46,260 --> 03:36:46,720
Wait!

4665
03:36:47,160 --> 03:36:48,160
Oh my god!

4666
03:36:48,900 --> 03:36:49,260
Oh!

4667
03:36:49,340 --> 03:36:49,640
Oh!

4668
03:36:50,060 --> 03:36:50,680
Wait!

4669
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:51,520
No!

4670
03:36:51,520 --> 03:36:51,980
No!

4671
03:36:52,360 --> 03:36:52,980
Oh!

4672
03:36:55,420 --> 03:36:56,040
Oh!

4673
03:36:58,520 --> 03:36:59,140
Oh!

4674
03:36:59,660 --> 03:36:59,680
Oh!

4675
03:36:59,960 --> 03:37:00,580
Oh!

4676
03:37:00,580 --> 03:37:00,820
Oh!

4677
03:37:03,630 --> 03:37:04,070
Oh!

4678
03:37:04,070 --> 03:37:04,490
Oh!

4679
03:37:04,670 --> 03:37:05,290
Oh!

4680
03:37:06,030 --> 03:37:06,350
Oh!

4681
03:37:12,270 --> 03:37:12,990
It's not...

4682
03:37:16,940 --> 03:37:18,100
I'm just going to go for it.

4683
03:37:27,260 --> 03:37:28,020
Did I do it?

4684
03:37:28,440 --> 03:37:30,480
I think I did it actually and it didn't do anything.

4685
03:37:30,920 --> 03:37:31,580
That's so funny.

4686
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:34,440
I'm going to do my rifle...

4687
03:37:34,440 --> 03:37:34,560
Wait!

4688
03:37:34,720 --> 03:37:35,820
We have my rifle equipped.

4689
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:38,620
We're going to enchant it.

4690
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:44,080
Select an item.

4691
03:37:48,740 --> 03:37:49,020
Go,

4692
03:37:53,650 --> 03:37:54,350
go, get out of there!

4693
03:37:54,450 --> 03:37:54,850
Get out of there!

4694
03:37:54,970 --> 03:37:56,710
Oh my gosh, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.

4695
03:38:14,390 --> 03:38:15,210
Oh my gosh!

4696
03:38:15,710 --> 03:38:17,250
Holy cow.

4697
03:38:21,410 --> 03:38:22,370
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4698
03:38:22,810 --> 03:38:23,570
Oh, my sanity.

4699
03:38:27,330 --> 03:38:29,710
You missed the potion that fully restores your magicka eight times.

4700
03:38:29,710 --> 03:38:30,030
Oops.

4701
03:38:31,370 --> 03:38:32,030
Oh well.

4702
03:38:33,070 --> 03:38:33,750
Oh my gosh.

4703
03:38:33,890 --> 03:38:34,550
Get out of there!

4704
03:38:34,650 --> 03:38:35,270
Get out of there!

4705
03:38:40,990 --> 03:38:46,510
I can't tell if that sound is it, like... deflecting or what?

4706
03:38:49,230 --> 03:38:50,910
Am I doing anything or what?

4707
03:38:53,030 --> 03:38:55,270
The stuck ricochet sound, right?

4708
03:38:56,170 --> 03:38:57,630
I think it's not doing anything.

4709
03:39:07,500 --> 03:39:08,740
I think it's reflecting.

4710
03:39:09,040 --> 03:39:10,100
Maybe I have to...

4711
03:39:10,120 --> 03:39:11,520
Maybe I have to enchant it with...

4712
03:39:16,460 --> 03:39:17,760
Oh my god!

4713
03:39:20,900 --> 03:39:21,900
Oh my god!

4714
03:39:22,120 --> 03:39:22,700
Our head!

4715
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:24,120
Peeta!

4716
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:32,600
Maybe I have to do it with the stronger one.

4717
03:39:33,160 --> 03:39:34,340
The spell might work.

4718
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:35,240
Or I...

4719
03:39:35,240 --> 03:39:38,600
Okay, isn't it Z for the magicka to target which one I want?

4720
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:39,880
So maybe I...

4721
03:39:39,880 --> 03:39:41,280
But it takes so long.

4722
03:39:41,480 --> 03:39:42,180
I think that's the issue.

4723
03:39:44,900 --> 03:39:46,920
When it glows, it's vulnerable to spell nine.

4724
03:39:47,160 --> 03:39:47,860
But it takes so...

4725
03:39:47,860 --> 03:39:49,320
Spell nine takes so long!

4726
03:39:49,780 --> 03:39:50,380
To do!

4727
03:39:51,040 --> 03:39:51,660
Oh, whoops.

4728
03:39:52,940 --> 03:39:53,720
It's just a load game.

4729
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:54,160
There we go.

4730
03:39:59,000 --> 03:39:59,720
This one?

4731
03:40:00,160 --> 03:40:00,520
Yeah.

4732
03:40:03,880 --> 03:40:05,080
Use only a three rune attack?

4733
03:40:05,260 --> 03:40:05,440
Okay.

4734
03:40:08,860 --> 03:40:10,460
Only need to use three... Okay, okay, okay.

4735
03:40:11,220 --> 03:40:13,140
Yeah, I feel like anything else would take too long.

4736
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:15,280
Alright, so then we'll do a...

4737
03:40:15,280 --> 03:40:15,440
Oh!

4738
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:15,740
Oh!

4739
03:40:15,820 --> 03:40:17,460
Calm down there, Peeta.

4740
03:40:18,920 --> 03:40:20,840
Calm down there, Peeta!

4741
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:24,020
We'll do the...

4742
03:40:25,400 --> 03:40:27,660
Let's bring our sanity all the way up.

4743
03:40:27,740 --> 03:40:28,920
Even though he's gonna take it...

4744
03:40:28,920 --> 03:40:30,480
He's gonna... It's fine though.

4745
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:31,640
Cast...

4746
03:40:32,460 --> 03:40:33,020
Sanitate.

4747
03:40:35,520 --> 03:40:37,160
The magic refill potion.

4748
03:40:37,360 --> 03:40:38,060
Where is it?

4749
03:40:40,980 --> 03:40:42,200
Where is it though?

4750
03:40:43,080 --> 03:40:45,810
In the hallway?

4751
03:40:47,030 --> 03:40:47,510
Let's go through here.

4752
03:40:49,810 --> 03:40:50,770
Oh, potion!

4753
03:40:52,670 --> 03:40:53,550
Oh, potion!

4754
03:40:54,630 --> 03:40:55,110
Potion.

4755
03:40:55,370 --> 03:40:57,090
Place where you found the custodian?

4756
03:40:58,910 --> 03:40:59,390
Huh?

4757
03:41:01,350 --> 03:41:01,990
Wait, what?

4758
03:41:02,670 --> 03:41:04,190
I don't remember that at all.

4759
03:41:06,550 --> 03:41:07,030
Oh?

4760
03:41:07,490 --> 03:41:08,790
Wait, I don't remember...

4761
03:41:08,790 --> 03:41:08,950
Wait.

4762
03:41:09,070 --> 03:41:10,470
The room across the way.

4763
03:41:11,230 --> 03:41:12,170
At the altar.

4764
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:21,500
The one at the altar.

4765
03:41:23,760 --> 03:41:25,260
Wait, how do we get to the altar?

4766
03:41:27,520 --> 03:41:27,960
Here?

4767
03:41:31,420 --> 03:41:31,860
Huh?

4768
03:41:32,440 --> 03:41:33,500
Wait, I'm so confused.

4769
03:41:36,620 --> 03:41:37,880
Oh wait, I never...

4770
03:41:37,880 --> 03:41:39,360
It wouldn't let me into this room before.

4771
03:41:39,920 --> 03:41:41,540
And now it decides it's okay?

4772
03:41:42,020 --> 03:41:42,680
That's weird.

4773
03:41:42,900 --> 03:41:43,300
Wait.

4774
03:41:44,240 --> 03:41:45,060
Oh my life.

4775
03:41:45,340 --> 03:41:46,620
It didn't even let me...

4776
03:41:46,620 --> 03:41:47,320
That's so... What?

4777
03:41:47,320 --> 03:41:51,020
I tried to go in here before and it didn't even let me.

4778
03:41:53,300 --> 03:41:54,680
Oh, it was a sanity effect.

4779
03:42:02,650 --> 03:42:05,130
I didn't even know that could be a sanity effect.

4780
03:42:05,630 --> 03:42:06,410
That's crazy.

4781
03:42:12,290 --> 03:42:13,070
Where is it?

4782
03:42:15,790 --> 03:42:16,590
Where are you?

4783
03:42:19,630 --> 03:42:20,610
You're pointing at something.

4784
03:42:22,710 --> 03:42:24,490
Not what I need you to be pointing at, I think.

4785
03:42:25,430 --> 03:42:26,150
Or maybe...

4786
03:42:26,150 --> 03:42:26,570
Maybe...

4787
03:42:26,570 --> 03:42:26,830
Yes.

4788
03:42:27,010 --> 03:42:27,630
I'm not sure.

4789
03:42:29,050 --> 03:42:29,950
Is it across the way?

4790
03:42:32,470 --> 03:42:33,630
This game is crazy.

4791
03:42:33,990 --> 03:42:34,350
Yeah.

4792
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:41,040
Oh, so in here.

4793
03:42:45,020 --> 03:42:46,300
I'm just so shocked.

4794
03:42:46,380 --> 03:42:47,320
Oh my gosh.

4795
03:42:47,980 --> 03:42:49,700
I was like, oh okay, I guess I can't go in.

4796
03:42:49,820 --> 03:42:50,140
Oh.

4797
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:52,060
I just believed it.

4798
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:01,720
Can I reload?

4799
03:43:02,880 --> 03:43:03,740
Can you reload?

4800
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:05,480
Can you reload?

4801
03:43:06,540 --> 03:43:07,620
Oh, there it is.

4802
03:43:08,840 --> 03:43:09,360
Minto.

4803
03:43:09,500 --> 03:43:09,920
Paragon.

4804
03:43:10,060 --> 03:43:10,360
See ya.

4805
03:43:10,460 --> 03:43:10,920
Paragon.

4806
03:43:11,060 --> 03:43:11,360
Paragon.

4807
03:43:11,440 --> 03:43:11,660
Later.

4808
03:43:11,840 --> 03:43:12,180
Paragon.

4809
03:43:12,320 --> 03:43:13,100
Thank you.

4810
03:43:16,120 --> 03:43:18,840
A milky blue bottle stands on the altar.

4811
03:43:19,820 --> 03:43:21,440
Oh, magical elixir.

4812
03:43:23,040 --> 03:43:23,560
Wow.

4813
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:25,540
Is this his insides, you think?

4814
03:43:26,440 --> 03:43:27,080
A smile.

4815
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:30,460
A small milky blue bottle is stoppered with a chipped cork.

4816
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:35,560
This magical elixir will restore all of Peter's magical energy, and we can use it five times.

4817
03:43:36,260 --> 03:43:36,680
Oh.

4818
03:43:39,880 --> 03:43:40,520
Okay.

4819
03:43:41,800 --> 03:43:42,120
Okay.

4820
03:43:44,160 --> 03:43:44,860
Let's go.

4821
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:50,280
Quit your...

4822
03:43:51,780 --> 03:43:53,000
Your heavy breathing.

4823
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:56,240
All right.

4824
03:43:56,280 --> 03:43:57,560
Now we can go through here.

4825
03:43:58,480 --> 03:43:59,120
Okay.

4826
03:44:04,830 --> 03:44:05,230
Wait.

4827
03:44:09,180 --> 03:44:10,320
I went through the right way, right?

4828
03:44:10,660 --> 03:44:11,060
Wait.

4829
03:44:11,100 --> 03:44:11,820
Am I going the right way?

4830
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:14,540
Yes.

4831
03:44:14,680 --> 03:44:14,900
Yes.

4832
03:44:16,500 --> 03:44:18,880
I didn't remember being able to see myself.

4833
03:44:21,160 --> 03:44:21,560
Okay.

4834
03:44:23,380 --> 03:44:24,180
And okay.

4835
03:44:25,600 --> 03:44:27,560
Let's do our enchantments first.

4836
03:44:31,020 --> 03:44:31,420
Wait.

4837
03:44:32,040 --> 03:44:32,580
Oh, no.

4838
03:44:32,680 --> 03:44:33,060
I wasn't...

4839
03:44:33,060 --> 03:44:33,360
Wait.

4840
03:44:33,440 --> 03:44:34,540
I don't think I should enchant myself.

4841
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:34,920
I don't think I should enchant it, though.

4842
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:37,700
I should only do this... the magical attack.

4843
03:44:39,020 --> 03:44:40,580
Let's quick spell this.

4844
03:44:41,620 --> 03:44:43,080
Let's do it to up.

4845
03:44:48,160 --> 03:44:48,840
Spell this.

4846
03:44:49,180 --> 03:44:49,940
Magical attack.

4847
03:44:50,220 --> 03:44:50,600
Cast.

4848
03:44:50,920 --> 03:44:51,200
Oh, no.

4849
03:44:51,260 --> 03:44:51,660
Assign.

4850
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:53,560
Three star.

4851
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:55,140
Red.

4852
03:44:55,760 --> 03:44:56,300
Up.

4853
03:44:56,480 --> 03:44:56,820
Okay.

4854
03:44:56,980 --> 03:44:58,140
So just press up.

4855
03:44:59,400 --> 03:45:00,500
Just press up.

4856
03:45:02,200 --> 03:45:02,740
And...

4857
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:04,020
I...

4858
03:45:04,020 --> 03:45:05,620
It was ricocheting, though.

4859
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:06,780
I really don't think it was doing anything.

4860
03:45:06,800 --> 03:45:09,700
I don't think it did any damage to enchant.

4861
03:45:11,500 --> 03:45:12,160
I think.

4862
03:45:12,420 --> 03:45:13,920
I don't think it was doing anything.

4863
03:45:17,480 --> 03:45:17,880
Okay.

4864
03:45:24,150 --> 03:45:25,470
Only when it's shining green.

4865
03:45:27,730 --> 03:45:28,890
Your gun was ricocheting.

4866
03:45:29,150 --> 03:45:29,430
Yeah.

4867
03:45:29,490 --> 03:45:29,610
Yeah.

4868
03:45:29,610 --> 03:45:29,850
I know.

4869
03:45:29,910 --> 03:45:30,410
That's what I was saying.

4870
03:45:30,530 --> 03:45:31,130
I wasn't...

4871
03:45:31,130 --> 03:45:32,370
I hadn't done any spells.

4872
03:45:34,090 --> 03:45:34,490
Yeah.

4873
03:45:34,550 --> 03:45:35,350
I didn't do any spells.

4874
03:45:35,810 --> 03:45:36,590
Because I...

4875
03:45:37,110 --> 03:45:37,510
Oh.

4876
03:45:37,750 --> 03:45:38,610
I did the one.

4877
03:45:39,810 --> 03:45:40,750
And I don't...

4878
03:45:40,750 --> 03:45:41,850
I would think I was too far away.

4879
03:45:41,990 --> 03:45:42,390
Okay.

4880
03:45:43,390 --> 03:45:43,910
Okay.

4881
03:45:43,910 --> 03:45:44,410
Okie dokie.

4882
03:45:47,230 --> 03:45:50,190
The boss may summon adds of an enchanted sword is good.

4883
03:45:50,430 --> 03:45:51,290
But it'll...

4884
03:45:51,290 --> 03:45:55,050
It'll stop being enchanted maybe by the time he summons them right?

4885
03:45:55,390 --> 03:45:57,650
I guess we can still do it and just hold it.

4886
03:45:57,930 --> 03:45:58,750
Enchant item.

4887
03:45:59,230 --> 03:45:59,750
Cast.

4888
03:46:01,270 --> 03:46:01,790
Red.

4889
03:46:02,250 --> 03:46:03,210
On my sword.

4890
03:46:10,490 --> 03:46:11,010
Okay.

4891
03:46:14,490 --> 03:46:15,010
Nice.

4892
03:46:15,990 --> 03:46:16,510
Alright.

4893
03:46:16,510 --> 03:46:18,450
I still have my shield.

4894
03:46:20,510 --> 03:46:25,680
I think I'm just gonna go in as is though.

4895
03:46:26,380 --> 03:46:28,620
And if I die, we'll reassess.

4896
03:46:30,240 --> 03:46:30,760
Alright.

4897
03:46:31,520 --> 03:46:32,760
Alright, let's go.

4898
03:46:33,700 --> 03:46:34,480
Let's go.

4899
03:46:34,620 --> 03:46:35,000
Yes.

4900
03:46:40,340 --> 03:46:41,620
I can't skip it.

4901
03:46:42,700 --> 03:46:43,100
Okay.

4902
03:46:45,500 --> 03:46:49,200
I have to press maybe Z, I think it is, for the spell magic.

4903
03:46:53,140 --> 03:46:55,320
What does the back of your skirt look like?

4904
03:46:56,660 --> 03:46:59,360
I have a reference on Twitter.

4905
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:03,260
Under my schedule, you can see my reference thingy.

4906
03:47:05,480 --> 03:47:06,860
I think it's there, isn't it?

4907
03:47:17,770 --> 03:47:23,570
Sorry, I can't really think much right now because I'm on boss mode.

4908
03:47:23,870 --> 03:47:25,750
It's boss time, baby.

4909
03:47:32,670 --> 03:47:34,210
He's trapping me here.

4910
03:47:36,690 --> 03:47:37,390
Okay.

4911
03:47:38,390 --> 03:47:39,090
Okay.

4912
03:47:39,150 --> 03:47:41,530
Why does Peter fight this thing, man?

4913
03:47:43,570 --> 03:47:44,270
Wait.

4914
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:50,460
It didn't...

4915
03:47:52,100 --> 03:47:53,000
Did it do anything?

4916
03:47:59,290 --> 03:48:00,170
Oh, shoot.

4917
03:48:01,950 --> 03:48:02,690
Oh, shoot.

4918
03:48:10,660 --> 03:48:12,140
What do you mean when she glows?

4919
03:48:17,920 --> 03:48:18,660
Oh, this part.

4920
03:48:24,520 --> 03:48:25,400
I see.

4921
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:25,560
I see.

4922
03:48:25,620 --> 03:48:25,720
I see.

4923
03:48:33,520 --> 03:48:34,400
That was close.

4924
03:48:35,080 --> 03:48:35,640
That's good.

4925
03:48:35,740 --> 03:48:37,480
We get to run around and regain our...

4926
03:48:37,480 --> 03:48:38,440
magic.

4927
03:48:46,560 --> 03:48:48,720
I wish, though, I could see the floor better.

4928
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:51,780
This camera angle is torture.

4929
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:54,940
Oh, shoot.

4930
03:48:55,500 --> 03:48:56,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4931
03:48:57,160 --> 03:48:57,760
All right.

4932
03:48:57,820 --> 03:48:58,580
Start glowing, lady.

4933
03:49:01,900 --> 03:49:02,740
Oh, my gosh.

4934
03:49:04,640 --> 03:49:05,700
I'm getting tired.

4935
03:49:09,980 --> 03:49:11,700
What is this?

4936
03:49:12,900 --> 03:49:14,240
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4937
03:49:17,560 --> 03:49:19,380
Can you do something else?

4938
03:49:19,940 --> 03:49:21,980
We need to get here, maybe.

4939
03:49:23,380 --> 03:49:24,160
Whoa.

4940
03:49:32,290 --> 03:49:33,570
I'm too close?

4941
03:49:44,710 --> 03:49:46,250
We're breaking free.

4942
03:49:48,090 --> 03:49:48,870
If

4943
03:50:00,700 --> 03:50:01,480
you held out, we can do that now.

4944
03:50:01,500 --> 03:50:02,360
We're breaking free!

4945
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:08,880
We're breaking free!

4946
03:50:13,380 --> 03:50:14,020
Is

4947
03:50:17,880 --> 03:50:20,720
she gonna... Oh no no, phase two!

4948
03:50:24,940 --> 03:50:27,280
Uh oh, I think she's summoning.

4949
03:50:30,440 --> 03:50:31,080
Actually...

4950
03:50:31,980 --> 03:50:34,700
Can I take these guys out with my...

4951
03:50:37,500 --> 03:50:39,020
with my... torch?

4952
03:50:42,060 --> 03:50:42,740
Instead...

4953
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:48,100
She's glowing!

4954
03:50:48,300 --> 03:50:49,320
I don't wanna miss this opportunity!

4955
03:50:55,830 --> 03:50:57,310
Torch too strong, baby.

4956
03:51:00,310 --> 03:51:01,610
Welcome to membership.

4957
03:51:04,790 --> 03:51:05,910
Mint phantom.

4958
03:51:06,650 --> 03:51:08,070
Please, mint phantom.

4959
03:51:10,590 --> 03:51:11,210
Oh my gosh.

4960
03:51:11,290 --> 03:51:11,510
Oh!

4961
03:51:11,530 --> 03:51:12,590
Ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch.

4962
03:51:16,350 --> 03:51:18,550
While you do that, I'm gonna...

4963
03:51:19,350 --> 03:51:21,450
I'm actually gonna recover...

4964
03:51:23,530 --> 03:51:24,250
my health.

4965
03:51:26,170 --> 03:51:28,230
You do your thing, I'll do my thing, okay?

4966
03:51:28,930 --> 03:51:29,630
Very cool.

4967
03:51:30,190 --> 03:51:31,350
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

4968
03:51:31,830 --> 03:51:33,950
You do your summon, I do my summon.

4969
03:51:34,070 --> 03:51:34,430
It's awesome.

4970
03:51:47,900 --> 03:51:49,740
Am I still too close to her?

4971
03:51:49,920 --> 03:51:51,180
When are you gonna glow again?

4972
03:51:55,960 --> 03:51:57,280
Oh my gosh, that was close.

4973
03:52:08,450 --> 03:52:09,670
My sanity, though.

4974
03:52:12,910 --> 03:52:14,170
She's not glowing anymore.

4975
03:52:17,090 --> 03:52:17,610
Oh!

4976
03:52:17,790 --> 03:52:18,430
Oh no!

4977
03:52:18,850 --> 03:52:19,730
Ah, shoot!

4978
03:52:21,090 --> 03:52:22,630
Oh, there, now she's glowing.

4979
03:52:24,190 --> 03:52:25,330
Okay, okay, okay.

4980
03:52:27,410 --> 03:52:27,930
No!

4981
03:52:29,750 --> 03:52:30,630
Oh my god.

4982
03:52:31,330 --> 03:52:32,130
Ah, shoot.

4983
03:52:34,290 --> 03:52:38,090
I don't know if I'll have enough time to do this, but...

4984
03:52:38,090 --> 03:52:43,050
Ignore the summons?

4985
03:52:43,070 --> 03:52:43,250
Okay.

4986
03:52:43,630 --> 03:52:44,150
Okay.

4987
03:52:45,130 --> 03:52:45,710
Okay, okay.

4988
03:52:46,810 --> 03:52:48,330
Okay, okay, I'll ignore the summons.

4989
03:52:52,690 --> 03:52:54,550
Oh, I'm also gonna do my thing, too.

4990
03:52:55,370 --> 03:52:55,970
I'm gonna...

4991
03:52:55,970 --> 03:52:57,430
I'm gonna do a big sanity.

4992
03:53:08,410 --> 03:53:09,270
Come here, lady.

4993
03:53:09,930 --> 03:53:10,590
I mean...

4994
03:53:10,590 --> 03:53:11,250
Come...

4995
03:53:11,250 --> 03:53:11,750
Start glowing.

4996
03:53:13,470 --> 03:53:14,270
Start glowing.

4997
03:53:14,430 --> 03:53:14,810
Oh, oh, oh.

4998
03:53:15,350 --> 03:53:15,750
Oh!

4999
03:53:15,850 --> 03:53:16,090
Ah!

5000
03:53:16,250 --> 03:53:16,510
No!

5001
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:18,050
Oh!

5002
03:53:18,110 --> 03:53:18,410
No!

5003
03:53:24,050 --> 03:53:25,610
You made me miss my chance!

5004
03:53:32,740 --> 03:53:34,440
You made me miss my chance.

5005
03:53:35,700 --> 03:53:36,260
Potion time!

5006
03:53:36,420 --> 03:53:36,720
You know what?

5007
03:53:36,720 --> 03:53:37,220
That's a good idea.

5008
03:53:37,380 --> 03:53:38,600
I forgot about it, that I had it.

5009
03:53:47,890 --> 03:53:50,650
I know that attacks basically hits everything.

5010
03:53:51,130 --> 03:53:52,390
I know how it works.

5011
03:53:52,550 --> 03:53:53,070
Okay, wait.

5012
03:53:53,150 --> 03:53:54,110
Actually, I don't...

5013
03:53:54,110 --> 03:53:56,470
But the thing is, I don't remember how to change targets.

5014
03:53:56,570 --> 03:53:56,910
That's...

5015
03:53:56,910 --> 03:53:57,770
That's my issue.

5016
03:53:59,330 --> 03:53:59,730
Um...

5017
03:54:01,130 --> 03:54:02,710
I don't know how to change targets.

5018
03:54:02,710 --> 03:54:02,750
I don't...

5019
03:54:05,410 --> 03:54:07,410
Okay, I'll try to remember.

5020
03:54:07,890 --> 03:54:09,010
Oh, you're okay.

5021
03:54:13,450 --> 03:54:14,530
You don't need to?

5022
03:54:17,650 --> 03:54:19,010
Wait, what do you mean you don't need to?

5023
03:54:21,130 --> 03:54:23,940
But I'm focusing on one thing, so wouldn't it...

5024
03:54:41,910 --> 03:54:43,650
I was too slow though.

5025
03:54:46,370 --> 03:54:47,570
Okay, I was too slow.

5026
03:54:47,850 --> 03:54:48,390
Okay.

5027
03:54:49,490 --> 03:54:51,710
Oh, that's hard though because it attacks her last!

5028
03:54:54,870 --> 03:54:56,250
See previous Super Chat.

5029
03:54:56,370 --> 03:54:59,750
Sorry, I can't scroll up because I'm playing the game.

5030
03:55:10,020 --> 03:55:11,440
Okay, got lots of sanity.

5031
03:55:16,700 --> 03:55:18,080
Oh, gosh.

5032
03:55:30,520 --> 03:55:31,960
Oh, shoot!

5033
03:55:36,220 --> 03:55:36,940
Yeah!

5034
03:55:37,260 --> 03:55:38,520
Okay, that's the timing.

5035
03:55:46,070 --> 03:55:47,230
I'm running around.

5036
03:55:47,530 --> 03:55:49,470
I'm getting more magic.

5037
03:55:52,190 --> 03:55:53,150
I'm getting more magic.

5038
03:55:54,650 --> 03:55:55,730
I'm getting more magic.

5039
03:55:57,630 --> 03:55:58,630
What's my magic at?

5040
03:56:03,010 --> 03:56:04,070
What's my sanity at?

5041
03:56:04,130 --> 03:56:05,030
Sorry, I have to keep checking.

5042
03:56:20,220 --> 03:56:20,680
Recover.

5043
03:56:20,860 --> 03:56:21,280
Cast.

5044
03:56:22,660 --> 03:56:23,880
More sanity, please.

5045
03:56:30,470 --> 03:56:31,650
More magic, please.

5046
03:56:35,890 --> 03:56:36,690
Oh, yeah.

5047
03:56:36,790 --> 03:56:38,970
I guess I can do a shield, right?

5048
03:56:39,130 --> 03:56:40,230
Yeah, this makes more sense.

5049
03:56:40,490 --> 03:56:40,770
Cast.

5050
03:56:43,890 --> 03:56:44,890
Never mind.

5051
03:56:45,150 --> 03:56:45,770
Just kidding.

5052
03:56:49,630 --> 03:56:51,070
I'll do it next time.

5053
03:57:01,950 --> 03:57:02,450
Yeah!

5054
03:57:02,550 --> 03:57:03,030
Yeah!

5055
03:57:03,070 --> 03:57:03,510
Yeah!

5056
03:57:03,510 --> 03:57:04,010
Yeah!

5057
03:57:05,550 --> 03:57:06,050
Oh!

5058
03:57:06,050 --> 03:57:06,170
Oh!

5059
03:57:09,740 --> 03:57:10,220
Oh, my God.

5060
03:57:10,280 --> 03:57:11,180
Even closer.

5061
03:57:12,480 --> 03:57:13,460
Are you okay, Peter?

5062
03:57:13,800 --> 03:57:14,420
Oh, my gosh, Peter.

5063
03:57:14,800 --> 03:57:15,660
Oh, we're right here.

5064
03:57:15,780 --> 03:57:16,060
Peter.

5065
03:57:16,820 --> 03:57:17,100
Peter.

5066
03:57:17,340 --> 03:57:18,260
We're really close to her.

5067
03:57:18,620 --> 03:57:19,180
Oh, my gosh.

5068
03:57:19,520 --> 03:57:19,800
Peter.

5069
03:57:21,000 --> 03:57:21,680
Oh, my gosh, Peter.

5070
03:57:23,180 --> 03:57:24,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, Peter.

5071
03:57:30,200 --> 03:57:31,480
Oh, Peter, I need you to run.

5072
03:57:32,140 --> 03:57:33,240
No, I don't want to die here.

5073
03:57:33,900 --> 03:57:35,120
I don't want to redo this whole thing.

5074
03:57:43,490 --> 03:57:43,790
Oh, my gosh.

5075
03:57:44,590 --> 03:57:44,950
Please.

5076
03:57:47,250 --> 03:57:48,590
How am I supposed to get her to glow?

5077
03:57:50,510 --> 03:57:51,470
Oh, like that.

5078
03:57:57,050 --> 03:57:59,570
I think I was too late.

5079
03:58:19,050 --> 03:58:19,830
Oh, I got her.

5080
03:58:20,650 --> 03:58:21,010
Nice.

5081
03:58:21,230 --> 03:58:22,350
Oh, my gosh.

5082
03:58:33,320 --> 03:58:34,300
Is she summoning stuff?

5083
03:58:48,920 --> 03:58:49,740
Okay, no.

5084
03:58:50,020 --> 03:58:51,940
Oh, my hands are really sweaty.

5085
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:16,960
First try.

5086
03:59:20,500 --> 03:59:21,180
Yippee.

5087
03:59:25,160 --> 03:59:25,840
Yippee.

5088
03:59:27,720 --> 03:59:29,080
Holy moly.

5089
03:59:30,020 --> 03:59:31,080
Okay, I...

5090
03:59:31,080 --> 03:59:31,460
I...

5091
03:59:31,460 --> 03:59:31,660
I...

5092
03:59:31,660 --> 03:59:31,780
I...

5093
03:59:31,780 --> 03:59:35,920
I know it's probably not needed, but...

5094
03:59:37,040 --> 03:59:37,520
Yippee.

5095
03:59:38,800 --> 03:59:40,020
Can I save?

5096
03:59:43,040 --> 03:59:43,520
That

5097
03:59:47,390 --> 03:59:48,930
is actually the hardest fight in the game?

5098
03:59:49,010 --> 03:59:49,370
No way.

5099
03:59:50,810 --> 03:59:52,910
I kind of feel like I cheesed it a little bit.

5100
03:59:55,350 --> 03:59:55,830
Examine.

5101
03:59:56,170 --> 03:59:59,170
But the guardian of Xelatoth vanquished.

5102
03:59:59,230 --> 04:00:01,730
And the stained glass that kept it hidden lying in pieces.

5103
04:00:01,930 --> 04:00:05,370
The essence of Chaturga is now liberated.

5104
04:00:05,370 --> 04:00:05,630
Oh, my gosh.

5105
04:00:05,630 --> 04:00:05,650
I need to see this.

5106
04:00:05,650 --> 04:00:06,170
Poor Paul.

5107
04:00:06,570 --> 04:00:07,370
Great job, Mitt.

5108
04:00:07,410 --> 04:00:09,050
See you next Eternal Darkness stream.

5109
04:00:09,110 --> 04:00:09,550
Thank you.

5110
04:00:10,330 --> 04:00:12,550
His magic beckons to Peter, calling...

5111
04:00:12,550 --> 04:00:13,790
Thanks so much for your help.

5112
04:00:13,810 --> 04:00:14,750
I appreciate it.

5113
04:00:15,470 --> 04:00:16,470
Calling to him.

5114
04:00:16,530 --> 04:00:17,570
He approaches cautiously.

5115
04:00:17,690 --> 04:00:19,530
Should Peter retrieve the essence of Chaturga?

5116
04:00:19,730 --> 04:00:20,210
Yes.

5117
04:00:20,630 --> 04:00:26,650
Peter reaches out for the artifact, but pulls away as he feels its corrosive magic close on his hand.

5118
04:00:26,930 --> 04:00:31,050
Wrapping his hands in a shred of cloth, he carefully lifts the artifact from its resting place.

5119
04:00:31,570 --> 04:00:32,570
Get Purgone.

5120
04:00:32,890 --> 04:00:33,390
Yeah.

5121
04:00:34,010 --> 04:00:34,510
Hahaha.

5122
04:00:35,630 --> 04:00:37,410
Here, I said I was only going to do one chapter.

5123
04:00:38,030 --> 04:00:39,010
And I did two.

5124
04:00:39,750 --> 04:00:40,330
Ha ha ha!

5125
04:00:40,870 --> 04:00:42,630
Sixty-nine years later!

5126
04:00:43,730 --> 04:00:46,050
And that was how I came by it.

5127
04:00:46,690 --> 04:00:50,150
I know it sounds crazy, but there you have it.

5128
04:00:50,510 --> 04:00:51,030
Nice!

5129
04:00:51,110 --> 04:00:54,010
The only proof I have is that statue.

5130
04:00:54,550 --> 04:00:56,310
Oh my gosh, he's alive!

5131
04:00:56,530 --> 04:00:57,270
It's a strange one.

5132
04:00:57,650 --> 04:00:58,770
He stayed alive!

5133
04:00:59,070 --> 04:01:00,090
I've seen one like it before.

5134
04:01:00,930 --> 04:01:01,770
You have?

5135
04:01:03,250 --> 04:01:03,770
Yes.

5136
04:01:03,770 --> 04:01:05,010
Very rare, though.

5137
04:01:05,010 --> 04:01:06,130
It's the asshole grandpa.

5138
04:01:06,430 --> 04:01:06,950
Very obscure.

5139
04:01:08,130 --> 04:01:10,490
I've had experts take a look at it.

5140
04:01:10,590 --> 04:01:10,790
Yeah.

5141
04:01:10,970 --> 04:01:12,930
And none of them know what it is.

5142
04:01:13,050 --> 04:01:14,170
And you do.

5143
04:01:14,910 --> 04:01:17,590
I'm somewhat of an expert on these things myself.

5144
04:01:17,830 --> 04:01:17,970
Oh.

5145
04:01:18,510 --> 04:01:22,050
An interest I developed a long time ago when I was a young man.

5146
04:01:22,170 --> 04:01:24,570
So that's why he's not in the world, in that...

5147
04:01:24,570 --> 04:01:27,410
Lord knows I have no interest in it.

5148
04:01:27,430 --> 04:01:29,210
He didn't die by the paragon.

5149
04:01:29,530 --> 04:01:30,870
I'm sure it's the cause of my sleeplessness.

5150
04:01:31,470 --> 04:01:33,290
I keep thinking about it.

5151
04:01:34,150 --> 04:01:34,950
As if...

5152
04:01:35,010 --> 04:01:36,670
It's calling out to me.

5153
04:01:36,970 --> 04:01:37,450
Golden.

5154
04:01:37,470 --> 04:01:38,310
Better drink, perhaps.

5155
04:01:39,250 --> 04:01:40,230
For the gift.

5156
04:01:40,390 --> 04:01:41,890
Live the rest of your life.

5157
04:01:41,890 --> 04:01:43,070
For an unusual objet d'art.

5158
04:01:43,310 --> 04:01:44,230
Objet d'art.

5159
04:01:45,050 --> 04:01:50,630
Live the rest of your life as little as you have left, Peter.

5160
04:01:52,470 --> 04:01:54,150
Wait, where does he hide it, though?

5161
04:01:54,630 --> 04:01:56,110
Aren't we supposed to go find it?

5162
04:01:56,790 --> 04:01:57,970
Objet d'art.

5163
04:02:00,970 --> 04:02:01,850
Alex, you good?

5164
04:02:02,310 --> 04:02:04,890
Having stopped reading, Alex discovers a small penny.

5165
04:02:04,890 --> 04:02:07,010
Taped to the back of Peter's chapter page!

5166
04:02:07,650 --> 04:02:08,730
How does...

5167
04:02:08,730 --> 04:02:11,670
We got the lucky penny, but...

5168
04:02:13,810 --> 04:02:14,350
How?!

5169
04:02:17,980 --> 04:02:18,860
You guys hear that?

5170
04:02:21,200 --> 04:02:22,160
Baby crying.

5171
04:02:27,780 --> 04:02:29,420
Now we have a seven.

5172
04:02:39,400 --> 04:02:40,700
Oh my gosh, he's scaring me.

5173
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:42,840
Stop it!

5174
04:02:43,100 --> 04:02:43,640
Babies!

5175
04:02:44,280 --> 04:02:44,820
Oh.

5176
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:45,540
Help me!

5177
04:02:45,540 --> 04:02:46,520
Please help me!

5178
04:02:46,640 --> 04:02:47,040
Oh my god!

5179
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:47,220
Ah!

5180
04:02:49,840 --> 04:02:51,760
Is it because I didn't protect you?

5181
04:02:52,100 --> 04:02:52,940
I'm sorry.

5182
04:02:55,720 --> 04:02:57,280
My house is haunted.

5183
04:02:58,880 --> 04:02:59,900
I can talk to her.

5184
04:03:00,140 --> 04:03:01,160
I can't get the blood out!

5185
04:03:03,630 --> 04:03:04,850
It's a ghost maid!

5186
04:03:08,170 --> 04:03:09,930
No, it's a ghost nurse.

5187
04:03:10,990 --> 04:03:12,510
It's not a ghost maid.

5188
04:03:13,790 --> 04:03:14,550
Basement key!

5189
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:21,120
Who keeps crying?

5190
04:03:23,400 --> 04:03:24,660
Do you remember?

5191
04:03:25,720 --> 04:03:28,100
21st night of park on, park on.

5192
04:03:30,720 --> 04:03:32,060
This is the basement, isn't it?

5193
04:03:32,300 --> 04:03:33,360
Oh, uh...

5194
04:03:42,730 --> 04:03:43,330
There's a...

5195
04:03:43,330 --> 04:03:47,530
Maybe going into the basement with my sanity so low is not a great idea.

5196
04:03:47,710 --> 04:03:49,010
I'm actually kind of freaked out.

5197
04:03:51,790 --> 04:03:52,710
Oh no!

5198
04:03:53,070 --> 04:03:54,210
Why do we need those?

5199
04:03:55,370 --> 04:03:56,810
Why do we need the shotgun shells?

5200
04:03:58,990 --> 04:03:59,870
Must be for later.

5201
04:04:02,110 --> 04:04:03,050
Why do we need this?

5202
04:04:03,790 --> 04:04:04,190
Save?

5203
04:04:04,330 --> 04:04:05,110
Oh yeah, let's save.

5204
04:04:07,310 --> 04:04:09,590
I did save after we beat the boss fight, but yeah.

5205
04:04:14,530 --> 04:04:15,090
What's this?

5206
04:04:15,530 --> 04:04:17,270
This safe is large and old-fashioned.

5207
04:04:17,370 --> 04:04:18,290
Made in the days...

5208
04:04:18,290 --> 04:04:19,990
My ceiling is leaking.

5209
04:04:20,430 --> 04:04:26,110
Made in the days when security was derived from the heavy metal construction, rather than secure locking mechanisms.

5210
04:04:27,390 --> 04:04:28,830
It doesn't look to be...

5211
04:04:28,830 --> 04:04:32,590
Oh, it doesn't look like it would be too difficult to break the combination.

5212
04:04:32,690 --> 04:04:36,410
If only Alex had a stethoscope to hear the tumblers more clearly.

5213
04:04:37,970 --> 04:04:38,870
Interesting, okay.

5214
04:04:40,510 --> 04:04:41,590
Our fuse box.

5215
04:04:42,150 --> 04:04:46,530
A fuse box and circuit breaker array is situated upon the wall.

5216
04:04:46,710 --> 04:04:48,270
All but one of the fuses are intact.

5217
04:04:48,630 --> 04:04:50,310
The absence of this one is suspicious.

5218
04:04:50,570 --> 04:04:53,630
And until it is replaced, the circuit connected to it is useless.

5219
04:04:53,630 --> 04:04:53,850
Oh!

5220
04:05:00,110 --> 04:05:02,330
Okay, we definitely want our house to burn down.

5221
04:05:03,710 --> 04:05:06,750
Alex jams the lucky penny in place of the missing fuse.

5222
04:05:13,690 --> 04:05:15,550
Oh, the place that we couldn't go into before!

5223
04:05:15,750 --> 04:05:16,270
It was too dark!

5224
04:05:24,600 --> 04:05:25,900
Why did all the sounds stop?

5225
04:05:26,500 --> 04:05:27,560
Okay, never mind.

5226
04:05:29,960 --> 04:05:33,380
I remember the, like, lever in here.

5227
04:05:33,860 --> 04:05:34,340
And everything.

5228
04:05:34,640 --> 04:05:35,660
What is...

5229
04:05:37,800 --> 04:05:38,240
Oh

5230
04:05:42,770 --> 04:05:43,710
boy, what is this?

5231
04:05:44,750 --> 04:05:45,770
What is all this?

5232
04:05:46,290 --> 04:05:51,170
A brass framework hangs from the ceiling, cradling the globe in the observatory above.

5233
04:05:51,470 --> 04:05:54,870
It seems to have been modified, now part of some elaborate locking mechanism.

5234
04:05:57,370 --> 04:05:59,010
Is this how we get into the underworld?

5235
04:05:59,790 --> 04:06:00,790
This must be it.

5236
04:06:01,770 --> 04:06:02,730
This must be...

5237
04:06:03,290 --> 04:06:03,510
Right?

5238
04:06:03,770 --> 04:06:04,610
It has to be.

5239
04:06:04,690 --> 04:06:05,490
It has to be!

5240
04:06:10,620 --> 04:06:11,820
Oh, I was gonna say...

5241
04:06:12,400 --> 04:06:14,540
Gosh, the game keeps out-timing me!

5242
04:06:14,780 --> 04:06:19,900
I was literally about to say, I'm going to raise my sanity unless we get something else other than baby crying.

5243
04:06:21,280 --> 04:06:22,980
And then we got a lady laughing!

5244
04:06:32,480 --> 04:06:32,960
Caprizona!

5245
04:06:33,320 --> 04:06:34,460
Welcome to my bishop bank!

5246
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:36,440
I warned you.

5247
04:06:38,160 --> 04:06:38,880
My house!

5248
04:06:40,240 --> 04:06:40,840
What the?

5249
04:06:41,060 --> 04:06:41,900
Oh my god!

5250
04:06:42,040 --> 04:06:43,400
This can't be happening!

5251
04:06:47,260 --> 04:06:50,200
It took me a second to see I was sinking into the floor.

5252
04:06:51,100 --> 04:06:52,240
Uh, this room, right?

5253
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:59,000
Oh gosh, last time we saw a bathtub, it was pretty freaky.

5254
04:07:00,140 --> 04:07:02,120
Journal of Maximilian Roivas!

5255
04:07:04,480 --> 04:07:06,920
That's not a page of the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

5256
04:07:10,940 --> 04:07:13,420
This is a page from Maximilian Roivas' journal.

5257
04:07:13,540 --> 04:07:18,560
It reads, I sought to love all, yet now love causes me pain and suffering.

5258
04:07:18,860 --> 04:07:23,220
I have learned to fear nothing, although it is nothing that I most fear.

5259
04:07:23,620 --> 04:07:28,640
All that were loyal to me now number amongst my worst enemies.

5260
04:07:36,640 --> 04:07:39,500
An antique medicine cabinet hangs on the wall.

5261
04:07:39,660 --> 04:07:43,400
Its wood stained from years of use in the ambient humidity of the room.

5262
04:07:44,140 --> 04:07:45,440
Should Alex open it?

5263
04:07:45,440 --> 04:07:45,780
Yes?

5264
04:07:50,180 --> 04:07:53,320
I also keep my pages in the bathroom.

5265
04:07:56,340 --> 04:07:58,380
We got a Legacy of Darkness!

5266
04:08:01,460 --> 04:08:07,440
You are not free to leave this plane until you complete a task for me.

5267
04:08:08,040 --> 04:08:11,720
You are to hunt and kill the master of this house.

5268
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:12,300
Oh, no, no.

5269
04:08:12,520 --> 04:08:15,420
Do this one thing and you will be free.

5270
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:16,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5271
04:08:16,360 --> 04:08:18,840
Else fear the wrath of Xelaton.

5272
04:08:19,100 --> 04:08:20,020
Wait, are you coming inside?

5273
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:21,400
No!

5274
04:08:24,200 --> 04:08:24,500
No!

5275
04:08:24,780 --> 04:08:26,420
My safe spot!

5276
04:08:30,460 --> 04:08:33,540
Everything is complete for your arrival, master.

5277
04:08:34,580 --> 04:08:35,180
No!

5278
04:08:35,360 --> 04:08:36,820
Now it is time for the planets to align.

5279
04:08:37,200 --> 04:08:40,040
And that is not too many years from now.

5280
04:08:40,680 --> 04:08:42,660
Another Roivas has crossed our path.

5281
04:08:42,660 --> 04:08:46,600
This time, we will not be so merciful.

5282
04:08:46,760 --> 04:08:49,780
Mercy has no place in this world.

5283
04:08:50,060 --> 04:08:52,060
It has only a place for me.

5284
04:08:52,480 --> 04:08:59,460
He will meet such a horrible death that the rest of the line will never set foot in his house again.

5285
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:02,420
Pray to me that they don't.

5286
04:09:02,780 --> 04:09:04,720
Pray to me anyway.

5287
04:09:07,580 --> 04:09:09,620
Yeah, pray to me anyway, guys.

5288
04:09:10,280 --> 04:09:11,060
Uh-oh.

5289
04:09:11,060 --> 04:09:12,940
So are there, like, dogs in my house now?

5290
04:09:16,020 --> 04:09:17,520
Are there dogs in my house?

5291
04:09:24,230 --> 04:09:25,710
Okay, I guess that's everything in here.

5292
04:09:36,160 --> 04:09:36,560
Okay.

5293
04:09:38,960 --> 04:09:39,920
Let's find out.

5294
04:09:40,180 --> 04:09:40,440
No!

5295
04:09:41,220 --> 04:09:42,060
Okay, I'll go out.

5296
04:09:42,160 --> 04:09:42,560
I just saved.

5297
04:09:47,450 --> 04:09:47,850
Golly.

5298
04:09:47,850 --> 04:09:50,330
The crying is just too much.

5299
04:09:50,410 --> 04:09:51,010
Please.

5300
04:09:51,250 --> 04:09:52,170
Oh my god!

5301
04:09:52,390 --> 04:09:52,850
Titties!

5302
04:09:56,900 --> 04:09:58,580
Do you remember Naomint?

5303
04:09:58,660 --> 04:09:59,560
The thrill of battle?

5304
04:09:59,620 --> 04:10:02,420
The clashing of bone in the 21st night of September?

5305
04:10:04,080 --> 04:10:05,640
Oh, what does it say?

5306
04:10:05,840 --> 04:10:07,600
A depiction of some monstrous landscape.

5307
04:10:07,820 --> 04:10:14,560
A blood-colored sky hangs over a dementedly surreal land in which flayed skin flaps in an acidic breeze.

5308
04:10:14,980 --> 04:10:16,800
What mind could have conceived this?

5309
04:10:17,900 --> 04:10:19,360
I'm gonna get demonetized.

5310
04:10:20,620 --> 04:10:21,820
I think.

5311
04:10:23,740 --> 04:10:24,680
Well, guys.

5312
04:10:24,960 --> 04:10:27,760
We have another page to read.

5313
04:10:30,040 --> 04:10:31,420
Which we shall do.

5314
04:10:32,980 --> 04:10:34,460
Or, another chapter, rather.

5315
04:10:34,580 --> 04:10:35,940
Which we shall do...

5316
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:39,200
Next week?

5317
04:10:40,020 --> 04:10:41,120
Yes, next week?

5318
04:10:42,060 --> 04:10:42,660
Wait.

5319
04:10:44,440 --> 04:10:45,040
Yes.

5320
04:10:46,000 --> 04:10:47,500
Well, I guess then...

5321
04:10:47,500 --> 04:10:48,320
What?

5322
04:10:49,660 --> 04:10:50,860
In two weeks.

5323
04:10:54,060 --> 04:10:56,300
I have to figure out my schedule from when I'm back.

5324
04:10:57,920 --> 04:11:00,320
Right after this I'll post the schedule for this week.

5325
04:11:00,380 --> 04:11:01,840
Though it really is just a stream tomorrow.

5326
04:11:02,020 --> 04:11:02,660
And that's about it.

5327
04:11:05,560 --> 04:11:08,960
Thank you guys for joining me for more Eternal Darkness today!

5328
04:11:11,100 --> 04:11:14,260
We're really unlocking our Paragon power.

5329
04:11:14,540 --> 04:11:16,700
I felt so powerful after that last fight.

5330
04:11:16,700 --> 04:11:19,420
Thank you for playing!

5331
04:11:19,580 --> 04:11:20,660
Thank you guys for watching!

5332
04:11:20,800 --> 04:11:22,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5333
04:11:24,120 --> 04:11:25,240
I'm starving.

5334
04:11:25,580 --> 04:11:26,980
That is one thing I am.

5335
04:11:27,200 --> 04:11:32,540
I think the food that my neighbors are making is coming in through the vents.

5336
04:11:33,640 --> 04:11:36,260
And it's making me so hungry.

5337
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:39,000
So!

5338
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:40,620
I'm going to go and eat.

5339
04:11:42,140 --> 04:11:44,140
I do have leftover pizza.

5340
04:11:44,680 --> 04:11:46,200
That's exactly what I was thinking.

5341
04:11:46,760 --> 04:11:48,160
Where can I go for the merch?

5342
04:11:48,400 --> 04:11:48,720
Yeah!

5343
04:11:48,760 --> 04:11:50,000
Lights.com!

5344
04:11:50,220 --> 04:11:53,420
You can pre-order my first ever Minto merch.

5345
04:11:53,680 --> 04:11:54,440
It's a Hoppy coat.

5346
04:11:55,760 --> 04:11:56,800
Great job on the boss!

5347
04:11:57,160 --> 04:11:58,500
Can't wait to see how this ends.

5348
04:11:58,600 --> 04:11:59,620
I also pre-ordered the Hoppy.

5349
04:11:59,800 --> 04:12:00,620
Thanks very much!

5350
04:12:00,840 --> 04:12:01,480
Thank you!

5351
04:12:01,920 --> 04:12:02,720
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5352
04:12:05,300 --> 04:12:06,660
I already ordered mine.

5353
04:12:06,760 --> 04:12:07,820
Thank you guys so much!

5354
04:12:07,860 --> 04:12:09,280
If you pre-ordered it.

5355
04:12:09,380 --> 04:12:09,820
Thank you!

5356
04:12:10,040 --> 04:12:11,580
I really, really appreciate it!

5357
04:12:11,580 --> 04:12:12,280
Oh my gosh, wait.

5358
04:12:12,380 --> 04:12:13,000
There we go.

5359
04:12:13,440 --> 04:12:14,120
Thank you!

5360
04:12:14,520 --> 04:12:15,300
Bye Hoppy!

5361
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:15,880
Get Hoppy!

5362
04:12:15,880 --> 04:12:16,720
Be happy for Minto!

5363
04:12:19,760 --> 04:12:20,200
Yes.

5364
04:12:20,200 --> 04:12:21,380
I'll pre-order it soon.

5365
04:12:21,640 --> 04:12:21,900
Yeah!

5366
04:12:21,940 --> 04:12:22,660
No rush.

5367
04:12:23,040 --> 04:12:24,040
Thanks for the stream, Minto!

5368
04:12:24,160 --> 04:12:24,760
I was gaming today.

5369
04:12:24,900 --> 04:12:25,180
Yeah!

5370
04:12:26,680 --> 04:12:27,520
We gamed.

5371
04:12:27,520 --> 04:12:29,520
I said I was only going to do one chapter and so we did two!

5372
04:12:31,920 --> 04:12:32,700
Hoppy, Hoppy!

5373
04:12:33,040 --> 04:12:34,580
Hoppy, Hoppy, Hoppy!

5374
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:35,900
Is that still a thing anymore?

5375
04:12:36,240 --> 04:12:38,820
Does anyone still care about the Neko meme?

5376
04:12:40,300 --> 04:12:42,280
Hoppy, Hoppy, Hoppy!

5377
04:12:44,950 --> 04:12:46,330
But, yeah.

5378
04:12:46,930 --> 04:12:48,930
Paragon, Paragon, Paragon!

5379
04:12:49,390 --> 04:12:53,580
Paragon, Paragon, Paragon!

5380
04:12:53,820 --> 04:12:54,640
Link for the merch!

5381
04:12:54,800 --> 04:12:56,680
Oh, let me do that.

5382
04:12:57,240 --> 04:12:59,260
Let me grab that.

5383
04:12:59,500 --> 04:13:00,520
Let me, hold on.

5384
04:13:00,700 --> 04:13:03,380
I have to resize my monitor.

5385
04:13:06,260 --> 04:13:10,580
Sorry, I just saw what Matara posted.

5386
04:13:11,840 --> 04:13:13,700
Girl, which one is a muffin?

5387
04:13:14,260 --> 04:13:16,700
Which one is a puppy?

5388
04:13:21,350 --> 04:13:22,410
Oh my gosh.

5389
04:13:22,530 --> 04:13:22,950
Okay.

5390
04:13:24,610 --> 04:13:25,490
Minto, Phantom.

5391
04:13:27,510 --> 04:13:28,550
Pre-order.

5392
04:13:28,950 --> 04:13:29,470
Hoppy.

5393
04:13:29,470 --> 04:13:29,850
Here.

5394
04:13:31,430 --> 04:13:31,950
Oh.

5395
04:13:31,950 --> 04:13:32,770
I did it.

5396
04:13:32,830 --> 04:13:33,330
Whoops.

5397
04:13:35,250 --> 04:13:35,770
Ah!

5398
04:13:35,890 --> 04:13:36,190
Wait!

5399
04:13:36,330 --> 04:13:36,810
Oh my gosh.

5400
04:13:36,890 --> 04:13:37,510
I think I just...

5401
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:37,990
Oh no!

5402
04:13:38,030 --> 04:13:39,530
I just put someone in timeout!

5403
04:13:39,690 --> 04:13:40,150
Rob!

5404
04:13:40,310 --> 04:13:41,310
I'm so sorry!

5405
04:13:41,870 --> 04:13:42,830
I undid it.

5406
04:13:42,930 --> 04:13:43,550
I undid it.

5407
04:13:43,670 --> 04:13:43,950
I'm sorry.

5408
04:13:49,970 --> 04:13:51,570
I'm so sorry, Rob.

5409
04:13:53,330 --> 04:13:53,970
I'm sorry.

5410
04:13:59,480 --> 04:14:00,420
I undid it though.

5411
04:14:00,600 --> 04:14:02,020
I think you should be safe.

5412
04:14:02,200 --> 04:14:02,840
Oh, I see you.

5413
04:14:02,980 --> 04:14:03,820
She hates me.

5414
04:14:03,900 --> 04:14:04,440
No, Rob!

5415
04:14:06,100 --> 04:14:06,880
You're still here.

5416
04:14:07,060 --> 04:14:07,780
You're still with us.

5417
04:14:08,580 --> 04:14:09,420
I did save.

5418
04:14:09,620 --> 04:14:11,220
So, I'm going to end here.

5419
04:14:11,480 --> 04:14:13,920
Thank you guys so much.

5420
04:14:14,260 --> 04:14:15,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5421
04:14:16,000 --> 04:14:17,540
See you guys tomorrow if I see you.

5422
04:14:17,580 --> 04:14:22,240
Tomorrow, if you're curious what it's going to be, I'm just going to be doing some silly stuff in VRChat.

5423
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:28,360
So, I'm just going to go around VRChat Explorer and, you know, do whatever.

5424
04:14:30,340 --> 04:14:31,980
Just going to be for funsies.

5425
04:14:34,660 --> 04:14:35,100
Yeah.

5426
04:14:35,380 --> 04:14:37,040
Since I have all my stuff set up.

5427
04:14:38,200 --> 04:14:41,520
For stuff that I was working on for my birthday.

5428
04:14:43,740 --> 04:14:44,220
What?

5429
04:14:44,440 --> 04:14:45,560
Oh, hint?

5430
04:14:45,920 --> 04:14:46,400
Hint?

5431
04:14:46,700 --> 04:14:47,180
Hint?

5432
04:14:49,340 --> 04:14:50,200

Thank you guys again for watching.

5435
04:14:54,820 --> 04:14:55,840
I really, really appreciate it.

5436
04:14:55,920 --> 04:14:59,640
And I hope you guys have a great rest of your day or night, whenever, whatever.

5437
04:15:00,280 --> 04:15:01,180
Otsuminto, otsuminto!

5441
04:15:06,200 --> 04:15:07,900
Bye bye!
