1
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,860
Wow.

2
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Hello.

3
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,910
Hello.

4
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,650
Hello.

5
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,990
Hello.

6
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,990
Welcome, welcome in.

7
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,990
Welcome in.

8
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,190
I'm nervous.

9
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,310
Thank you so much for the podcast.

10
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,190
Thank you.

11
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,690
Thank you.

12
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,010
Thank you.

13
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,630
I'm nervous.

14
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,670
I'm nervous.

15
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,050
Why?

16
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:33,210
Because I feel like... I've never... I've never played any of these games before.

17
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,830
We heard of the High Elves.

18
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,890
What are they, like goats?

19
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,590
They live up on a mountain?

20
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,310
Me either.

21
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,790
It's Skyrim.

22
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,190
Yeah, it's Skyrim!

23
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,370
I... Oblivion is super chill.

24
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,090
Is it?

25
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,490
Okay.

26
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,070
I was always... I never got into these games because they weren't animated.

27
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:13,270
And then... by the time I... by the time... I...

28
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,690
I don't know.

29
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,510
By the time Skyrim happened, everything...

30
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,410
I was like... oh, it's too... it's too deep.

31
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,370
I can't... I can't join in now.

32
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:29,910
So...

33
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,310
Um...

34
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,430
Now I'm... now I'm here.

35
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,950
Get mods and make it anime.

36
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,570
No!

37
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,250
Some people were wondering why... you know...

38
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,070
Remastered is more expensive.

39
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,890
But I know that the original has a lot of mods and stuff.

40
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,850
But I just want to play Vanillo.

41
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,210
Since it's my first time ever playing the games.

42
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,910
And then also...

43
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,510
I know the remaster had quality of life updates and stuff.

44
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,710
And...

45
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,870
It's because some people were like...

46
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,350
Oh, the original is so much cheaper.

47
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,310
And things like that.

48
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,970
But...

49
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,490
This is my first time ever playing.

50
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,030
So I've never... I didn't...

51
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,230
You know, I didn't spend money on the previous games.

52
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,750
So...

53
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,790
To me...

54
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm not...

55
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,950
It doesn't feel like I'm paying again for the same game.

56
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,570
I'm just...

57
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,230
I'm...

58
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,630
I'm buying a new game.

59
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,390
So...

60
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,690
I don't know.

61
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,110
We'll see.

62
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,950
We'll see.

63
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,030
Your Kamiyoshi is playing through them too.

64
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,890
It's never too late.

65
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,430
But I have seen many Eclipse from this game for some time now.

66
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,110
Of all the silliness that happens in it.

67
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,270
So even for like months, I've been like, man, I kind of want to play this game.

68
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,130
And then the...

69
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,010
Re-Monster happened.

70
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,890
And I was like...

71
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,430
Yippee!

72
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,150
You're gonna full...

73
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,910
Going full curse monstrosity character or regular pretty character?

74
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,250
Well...

75
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,670
Well...

76
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,730
Yeah, the lady that goes...

77
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,790
I think it's gonna be pretty.

78
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
I think it's gonna look good.

79
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
I think it'll look good.

80
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,060
I think.

81
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,980
Actually, I don't...

82
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,660
I know that the character creation in this is pretty extensive, but...

83
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm not super into character creation.

84
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,700
It's not like...

85
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,560
You know, I'm not somebody that sits in The Sims and like...

86
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,220
Creates a character's every minute detail for hours and hours.

87
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,760
It's never been my thing, so...

88
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,260
All sliders to the left.

89
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,760
So...

90
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,220
I just...

91
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm gonna...

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,560
We'll see.

93
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,800
I might get into it.

94
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,260
Who knows?

95
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,260
But I think...

96
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,560
I think we should just start.

97
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:10,840
No?

98
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,540
Oh my gosh.

99
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm nervous.

100
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,380
Liverp...

101
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,520
You could create snake.

102
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,400
I was born 87 years ago.

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
Oh my god, it's the Elder Scroll!

104
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,980
For 65 years, I've ruled as Tamriel's uncle.

105
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,760
It's him!

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,340
But for all these years, I've never been the ruler of my own dreams.

107
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,060
I have seen the gates of oblivion.

108
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,340
Who said it?

109
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,300
Beyond which no waking eye may see.

110
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,280
Behold, in darkness, a doom sweeps the land.

111
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,980
I should pay attention.

112
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,040
Oh, lizard!

113
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Hohohoho, cute!

114
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,900
Hi, dad!

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,060
Hi, dad!

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah!

117
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,820
Hold on, I'll read after the cutscene.

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,500
How's the audio?

119
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,320
Is it too loud?

120
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,760
Just let me know.

121
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,140
Ooh!

122
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,840
This is the 27th of last seed.

123
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,860
The year of Akatosh, 433.

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,960
Akatosh.

125
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,200
He's dead?

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,320
The closing days of the third era.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,420
And the final hour of my life.

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,280
No, Elder!

129
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,240
Elder Scroll!

130
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,820
Mr. Scroll, no!

131
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,600
No!

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
No, Mr. Scroll!

133
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,500
Wow, it's so epic!

134
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,040
Whoa!

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Is this the original soundtrack?

136
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,680
Like, the rather...

137
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,540
I think they re-dubbed the voices?

138
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,580
Maybe not?

139
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,020
What is this?

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,160
Yeah?

141
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,740
Oh!

142
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,220
Same music.

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,600
Oh!

144
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,420
Oh my god, I'm a mouse!

145
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,040
Why do I live in such a tiny home?

146
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,840
Oh, to level up...

147
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,420
Oh, never mind.

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,000
Just kidding.

149
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,900
Oh, okay.

150
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,660
20 years later, this music still gets me hyped.

151
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,340
Squeak, squeak, squeak!

152
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,960
Squeakers, squeakers, squeakers!

153
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,300
You versus 100 Wisps, would you win?

154
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:34,660
Yep.

155
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Also, was it your intention to have your schedule room die on April 30th?

156
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,020
Yep.

157
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,260
Elder Scrolls lore is convoluted and insane, but thankfully you need to know none of it to play the game.

158
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,640
Yeah, I asked people.

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,460
I was like, do I need to know about anything to play?

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,260
I could be a lizard.

161
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,540
Okay.

162
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,260
So, guys...

163
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,420
Hold on.

164
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,360
I could be Brendan.

165
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,360
A dark elf.

166
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,000
Whoa.

167
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,020
Mohawk.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:07,740
Why?

169
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,120
Wait.

170
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,260
The Mohawk...

171
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,300
Like, bald...

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,380
Bald...

173
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,960
It's kind of...

174
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Wow.

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
That's kind of insane.

176
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,460
He's got, like, the stereo...

177
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,800
Like, just get rid of the Mohawk and he's, like, a salary man.

178
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,260
I could be...

179
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,940
Oh, it's the high elf!

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,520
I could be a goat elf.

181
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,460
Imperial?

182
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,860
Is this just a guy?

183
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,980
I should be reading, huh?

184
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,640
Okay, hold on.

185
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Reptilian race, well-suited for the treacherous swamps of its homeland, has developed natural immunities to poisons.

186
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,380
They can breathe underwater and are good at picking locks.

187
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,100
You guys, I saw a tutorial on how to lockpick.

188
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,060
I forgot it, though.

189
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Argonians are genetically engineered by sentient trees.

190
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,120
Oh.

191
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
But it says they're a reptile.

192
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,100
That doesn't sound like a tree.

193
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:07,100
Brendan is, in addition to their quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, even the humblest of...

194
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, Breton!

195
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh my god.

196
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
The humblest...

197
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,700
I thought his name was Brendan!

198
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,500
The humblest of Bretons can boast a resistance to magical energies.

199
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,140
They are particularly skilled at summoning and healing magic.

200
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,640
Okay, he's just a guy.

201
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,760
Just look at this.

202
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
Just a guy.

203
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,340
Oh.

204
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,400
Oh.

205
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
A guy who's gonna get the rope.

206
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,420
Dark elf, also known as Dunmer.

207
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,400
Or, in their homeland of Morrowind.

208
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,680
The dark elves are noted for their skilled and balanced integration of the sword and bow and destruction magic.

209
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
They are resistant to fire...

210
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,220
And can summon an ancestral ghost?

211
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,960
Wait, randomize appearance?

212
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
Will that...

213
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,840
Will that make me select it?

214
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,040
Oh!

215
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, no!

216
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,620
Wait.

217
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,260
Oh!

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,740
Why are they obsessed with mohawks in this game?

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,920
The high elf, also known as Altmer.

220
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,400
In their homeland of Somerset Isle.

221
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,100
The high elves are exceptionally gifted in the arcane arts.

222
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,280
They also boast resistance to illness.

223
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,700
However, they are also somewhat vulnerable to fire for...

224
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:39,920
Okay.

225
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,060
No vulnerability allowed here.

226
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
Me to summon others.

227
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,440
He looks like one of those...

228
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,060
He looks like one of those cats with the flat faces.

229
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,780
Oh my god!

230
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:31,140
Oh my god!

231
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,940
Special skills.

232
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,420
Get this normie out of here.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
I can be a cat!

234
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh my god, so many cats.

235
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh wow, oh my god Taiga.

236
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh no, how are you balding when you're a cat?

237
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
How is that possible?

238
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Who stressed you out?

239
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,720
Khajiit?

240
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,560
Is that what it's pronounced?

241
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,380
Hailing from the province of Elsweir.

242
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
They are intelligent, quick, and agile.

243
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,720
They make excellent thieves due to their natural agility and unmatched acrobatic skills.

244
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,740
All Khajiit can see in the dark.

245
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,340
Elsewhere.

246
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,260
Oh, elsewhere.

247
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,160
No backseating suggestions for final choices, but I suggest playing around in character sliders to see some very cursed possibilities.

248
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,900
I will, thank you.

249
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,620
Hmm.

250
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,240
Bald is just the peak physique of hair growth.

251
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,260
This guy's got hair.

252
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,560
What the hell is up with the mohawks?

253
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,700
I don't understand.

254
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,660
I don't...

255
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,280
Oh, hi.

256
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,940
Oh my god.

257
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,580
Cheetah.

258
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't understand.

259
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,240
Oh my gosh.

260
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,700
Snake.

261
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,100
Um.

262
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,180
Nord.

263
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, oh.

264
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,760
By the way, this video is sponsored by Nord VPN.

265
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,740
No, just kidding.

266
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,600
Can you imagine?

267
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
He's not bald.

268
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,660
He's just slightly taller than his hairline.

269
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,980
Oh.

270
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,920
That's so positive.

271
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,920
Could you come in all forms, including little cats and big tiger forms, but we only played the bipedal ones in games.

272
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,800
Aw, man.

273
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,180
Citizens of Skyrim.

274
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,400
They are tall and fair-haired people.

275
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,800
Strong and hardy.

276
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,860
Nords are famous for their resistance to cold.

277
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,700
They are highly talented warriors.

278
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,380
Just say it's just a guy.

279
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:38,920
Wow.

280
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,700
Watching his face, like, expand like that.

281
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,580
Can't wait for her to resist arrest.

282
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,200
I won't get arrested.

283
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,060
Whoa.

284
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,160
Wow.

285
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,380
That eye shadow.

286
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,140
Balding.

287
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Oh.

288
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,700
You should transfer some of that onto the top of your head.

289
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,120
This is so wow.

290
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,540
This looks like one of the- Ah!

291
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,200
Ah!

292
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,420
It's-

293
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,610
He looked fine from the front.

294
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,610
I was gonna say, he looked like one of the Da Vinci twins.

295
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,670
And- Hahaha.

296
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,890
But, wow.

297
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,810
Wee.

298
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,070
Oh my gosh.

299
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,470
And he's got, like, hot pink eyeshadow.

300
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,170
Hahaha.

301
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,980
Wow.

302
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,640
Wow.

303
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,100
Wow.

304
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,940
Do you think he was born like that or is it like a botched surgery?

305
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,800
Orc.

306
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,620
The people of the Rothgarian and Dragontail mountains.

307
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,760
Orcish armorers are prized for their craftsmanship.

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,180
Craftsmanship.

309
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,100
Orc troops and heavy armor are among the finest in the empire and are fearsome when using their berserker rage.

310
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,680
What a... what a cutie.

311
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,260
I like the lipstick.

312
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,220
Wow, that's the flattest head I've ever seen.

313
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,960
Wow.

314
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,260
Wow.

315
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,100
What is that?

316
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,120
What's the...

317
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,040
When you wear headphones for too much and it dents your head.

318
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,080
That's what that feels like it should be.

319
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,780
The headset then.

320
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,980
Again with the mohawk.

321
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Oh, hi!

322
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,260
I used to be a lurker but since I lost my Kabuyoshi yesterday...

323
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,280
I'll participate more of my other Oshii streams and activities.

324
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,540
Hi, Neko!

325
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,980
It was a really, really nice concert though.

327
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,080
So...

328
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,980
It was so...

329
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,340
Wah.

330
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,910
But thanks for hanging out.

331
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,890
And thank you for the super chat.

332
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,770
Yeah, I saw the stream got blocked but usually...

333
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,890
the companies can fight that.

334
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,690
So...

335
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,430
I have faith that it'll come back.

336
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,130
Yeah, usually they should...

337
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,850
They take care.

338
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,390
They can handle that and take care of it.

339
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,170
Because...

340
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,090
For...

341
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,770
Those kinds of shows they have to get permission for...

342
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:31,850
For...

343
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,670
All the songs that need.

344
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,390
Well, not permission.

345
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:34,770
Oh!

346
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,670
Yes, permission!

347
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,270
But also like...

348
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,850
Um...

349
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,330
There's a site.

350
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,090
This is...

351
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,610
This is...

352
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,010
I feel...

353
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,770
Pretty common knowledge.

354
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,310
There's a site called Jazzrack.

355
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,650
That...

356
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,350
Uh...

357
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,770
You can check...

358
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,990
Song permission?

359
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,070
For...

360
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,030
Like if it's okay for...

361
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,930
Um...

362
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,050
Streaming...

363
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,090
Or...

364
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,470
Um...

365
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,450
You know...

366
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,630
Uh...

367
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,550
Using at an event.

368
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,430
Things like that.

369
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:02,970
So...

370
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,490
Um...

371
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,050
If it's...

372
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,990
If it's like streaming okay...

373
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,150
Then...

374
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,590
You know...

375
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,270
Which...

376
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,710
Usually for companies...

377
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,790
They always get the okay.

378
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,050
Um...

379
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,570
Hi Neko!

380
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,070
Welcome!

381
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,710
Thank you!

382
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,530
Uh...

383
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,670
Then...

384
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,050
You know...

385
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,850
It should be...

386
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,510
It should be back.

387
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:19,870
Hmm...

388
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Yeah...

389
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,480
Yeah...

390
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,780
Sony's copyright bot malfunctioning...

391
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,460
Happens all the time.

392
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:27,940
Yeah...

393
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Unfortunately...

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,840
Unfortunately...

395
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,920
It does suck though...

396
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,120
That it was like...

397
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,780
Immediately taken down.

398
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:36,980
Uh...

399
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,020
I hope everyone's...

400
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,800
Okay...

401
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Recently...

402
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,900
Um...

403
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,520
You know...

404
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,420
There was the...

405
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,260
Matara news...

406
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,820
This morning too...

407
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,760
Um...

408
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,540
Uh...

409
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,380
I did...

410
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,880
I didn't know about...

411
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,940
It...

412
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,800
I'm not gonna say much...

413
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,300
But...

414
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,500
I know everyone's kinda feeling a little like...

415
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,140
Antsy...

416
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,720
With...

417
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,740
Everything that's happening...

418
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:01,900
Um...

419
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,380
Matara's around to stay...

420
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,720
So...

421
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:03,900
You know...

422
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:04,860
Unfortunately...

423
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,460
Uh...

424
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,160
Um...

425
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
Obviously I...

426
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Don't wanna say anything...

427
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,620
And have her say everything that she wants to say...

428
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,240
But...

429
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,400
Um...

430
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,380
Um...

431
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,520
Um...

432
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
Didn't wanna bring up a sad topic...

433
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,840
No, no, no, no, no...

434
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,220
It's okay...

435
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,280
It's okay...

436
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,900
Uh...

437
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,860
I just wanna make...

438
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,420
I just wanna kind of like...

439
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,080
You know...

440
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,580
Uh...

441
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,440
I...

442
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,260
I feel...

443
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,180
That so many people are like...

444
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,600
Uh...

445
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,220
It's such a turbulent time to be a VTuber fan...

446
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,100
And...

447
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,000
Um...

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
But...

449
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,880
At the same time...

450
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,200
It's very easy to get bogged down by all the negative news...

451
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,760
Um...

452
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:45,800
Um...

453
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,960
There's a lot of really fun things happening too...

454
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,340
There's always fun events...

455
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,620
Going on...

456
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,490
There's things that people are planning...

457
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,120
So...

458
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,350
Try and always, you know...

459
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,280
Uh...

460
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,240
Keep...

461
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,100
Grounded...

462
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,980
Keep focusing on those sorts of things as well...

463
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,760
Because...

464
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:01,980
You know...

465
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,620
It's very easy to...

466
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,580
Get...

467
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,880
Distracted...

468
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,600
And...

469
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,380
Only see all the negative that's going on...

470
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,320
And...

471
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,360
Um...

472
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,880
Hmm...

473
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,600
So...

474
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,720
Yeah...

475
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,600
Just uh...

476
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,920
I...

477
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm trying to be...

478
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,340
Very...

479
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,820
Hopeful for the future...

480
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,280
So...

481
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,600
I think that...

482
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:26,920
You know...

483
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,760
At least for me...

484
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
I have a lot of really fun things planned...

485
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,140
So I...

486
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,180
Want to...

487
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,780
Keep...

488
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,860
Um...

489
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,620
Focusing on that...

490
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,440
And...

491
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,300
Uh...

492
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,400
You know...

493
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,720
Make...

494
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,320
Why is the music so scary?

495
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,540
Ha ha ha...

496
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,440
Ha ha ha...

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,500
And...

498
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,960
Uh...

499
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,540
I wanna keep focusing on that...

500
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,140
So that...

501
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,320
I can help...

502
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,500
Or...

503
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,120
Rather...

504
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,440
Not...

505
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,220
How do I say...

506
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,000
I can...

507
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,420
Um...

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,040

Stuff to you guys...

511
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
And...

512
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,060
Uh...

513
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,020
So...

514
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,980
Yeah...

515
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,780
Ha ha ha...

516
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,400
Sorry, my brain got distracted by the music...

517
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Spooky hunting...

518
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,660
Spooky hunting...

519
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,680
Ha ha ha...

520
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,140
Ha ha ha...

521
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,500
Ha ha ha...

522
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,840
Ha ha ha...

523
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,400
Hmm...

524
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,820
I saw your guest appearance at the call and mix panel get announced today for Ofkai...

525
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,400
Sloppy sisters reunited...

526
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh!

527
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,780
Was that announced?

528
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,580
Ha ha ha...

529
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,500

Um...

532
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,640
Well, I'm not a guest...

533
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,060
It's not a sloppy sister...

534
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,380
I don't know if a sloppy sister reunite...

535

They all got...

542
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,980
They're all on the red carpet...

543
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,080
And I'm like...

544
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,300
Behind them...

545
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,760

546
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,720

Ha ha...

548
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,600
Maybe I can get on there too...

549
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,380
Ha ha ha...

550
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,980
So...

551
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,700
But yeah...

A little bit...

555
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,980
In...

556
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,440
My own capacity...

557
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,700
And maybe...

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,480

Creepy stalker Minto...

575
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,390
I don't need a model...

576
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,600
I-he — That's just my natural form.

577
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,180
I mean, Elder's Ring.

578
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,400
Wait, Elder Scroll.

579
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:39,820
Wait.

580
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,740
No, this is the scroll.

581
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,180
Elder Ring?

582
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,100
That's when two old people get married.

583
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,980
Pyrobug, thank you so much for the time gift.

584
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,720
Thank you!

585
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,320
Elder's Ring.

586
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,080
Who's scrolling?

587
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,020
Thank you for cheering up the wispy key between me two for Halloween.

588
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,540
Plus my cat getting sick.

589
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,160
Oh, the cat's okay.

590
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,140
Gosh, my voice is really dead today.

591
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,980
Vod Watcher.

592
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,580
Hi, thanks for dropping by.

593
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,420
Okay, let's continue.

594
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,140
We got the Red Guard.

595
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,140
The most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel.

596
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:39,160
In addition to their cultural affinities for many weapons and armor styles, they also have a hearty constitution and natural resistance to disease and poison.

597
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,580
Wait, who else also was resistant to fire?

598
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,300
Someone else was resistant to poison.

599
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,140
Illness.

600
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,620
Oh!

601
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,820
Argonian.

602
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,990
Everybody has no hair and then this guy...

603
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,050
Oh wait, this guy...

604
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,830
These guys actually have a lot of hair.

605
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,670
There's always ups and downs as long as we're all there for each other.

606
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,370
Hmm.

607
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,050
Yeah, I know it's been feeling probably more like more downs than ups.

608
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,350
And I'll be honest, it's...

609
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,510
Uh...

610
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,790
It's...

611
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,870
How do I say?

612
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,390
It's not...

613
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:27,690
It's not...

614
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,130
Discouraging isn't the right word.

615
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,770
It's more like...

616
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,530
Kind of just like a...

617
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,190
Disheartening.

618
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,170
I think disheartening.

620
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,410
Because...

621
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,890
To me...

622
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,530
I feel that the VTuber...

623
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,070
Sphere thrives when we're all thriving.

624
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,910
And so...

625
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,310
When it feels like...

626
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,910
When I see comments from people saying things like...

627
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,850
Ah...

628
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,330
VTubers are dead!

629
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,510
The...

630
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,610
Everything's imploding!

631
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,270
Ah...

632
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,850
The...

633
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,110
Everything's falling apart!

634
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,810
You know...

635
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,850
To me, I'm just like...

636
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,330
Ah...

637
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,530
There's still so much...

638
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,530
So much good!

639
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,850
And so much going on!

640
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,170
And...

641
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,810
You know...

642
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,790
Ultimately...

643
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,630
VTubers are just a streaming medium.

644
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,630
It's just another different way of...

645
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,610
Not even just streaming...

646
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,310
But another entertainment medium...

647
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,570
That would be saying like...

648
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,430
Twitch streamers...

649
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,950
Are...

650
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,790
Are done!

651
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,650
You know...

652
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,870
Like it's...

653
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,510
Or...

654
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,230
Or...

655
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,070
YouTubers are done!

656
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,430
It's just a subset of that!

657
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,010
You know...

658
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,410
But...

659
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,490
Hmm...

660
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,930
I just want...

661
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,430
I just...

662
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,370
Hope that...

663
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,730
If you kind of get...

664
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,870
Uh...

665
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,190
If you kind of only see...

666
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,630
The...

667
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,150
Doomer mentality...

668
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,050
Being spread around...

669
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,590
Um...

670
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,050
It's okay to just kind of...

671
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,730
You know...

672
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:52,930
Uh...

673
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,510
Uh...

674
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,170
Oh my god...

675
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,310
I almost said it again...

676
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,750
I almost said get off...

677
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,270
But I wanted to say get off Twitter...

678
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,450
Why do I feel like I've talked about this just so recently?

679
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,530
You know what?

680
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,030
Yeah!

681
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,370
If you're feeling down...

682
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,690
If you're just like...

683
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,250
If all this bad news is bogging you down...

684
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,190
Just get off!

685
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,910
Just let loose!

686
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,230
And get off!

687
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,990
And...

688
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,110
Enjoy yourself!

689
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,990
And don't think about...

690
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,450
The things that make you sad!

691
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,430
You know what?

692
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,050
I'll tell it to you straight!

693
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:30,770
Hot tag!

694
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,590
Hot tag!

695
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,860
There we go...

696
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,030
Yeah!

697
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,510
Long-haired mean though!

698
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,830
Yeah!

699
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,970
I felt like it probably suited the game better!

700
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,430
I don't know why I thought that!

701
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,650
Speak your truth!

702
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,090
Thank you!

703
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,850
I'm getting off!

704
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,670
We're getting off together!

705
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,210
I'm logging off, actually!

706
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,010
Goodbye!

707
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:04,890
No, just kidding!

708
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:07,850
Uh...

709
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,190
I'm glad you're here haunting us!

710
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,030
Looking forward to all the big projects you're cooking!

711
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,770
Thank you!

712
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,130
Thank you!

713
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:14,630
Thank you!

714
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,050
Wood Elf!

715
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,310
Why are there so many Elves?

716
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,430
The Clan Folk of the Western Valand Wood Forest, also known as Bosmer.

717
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,590
Wood Elves are nimble and quick, making them good scouts and thieves.

718
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,270
And there are no finer archers in all of Tamriel.

719
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,470
Their ability to command simple creatures is...

720
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,390
They have to command the creature!

721
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,870
Oops!

722
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,610
They have to command the creature!

723
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,570
Thanks for the permission!

724
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,190
I got you!

725
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,310
I'm getting off!

726
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,430
Get me off this ride!

727
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,420
The noses on these characters are always so crazy!

728
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,280
Andrei goes, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

729
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,280
Thank you!

730
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,880
You look so polite!

731
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,220
Hmm...

732
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,420
Hmm...

733
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,420
Hmm...

734
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,320
Guys, I don't know.

735
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,740
I feel like I should roll a dice.

736
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,060
Hmm...

737
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,640
But this is like...

738
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,460
Good soldiers follow orders!

739
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
Swapcoast, thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

740
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,240
Thank you!

741
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,920
I...

742
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,140
I...

743
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,580
This is like the most important thing, no?

744
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:37,660
No!

745
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,760
Because it determines how you play, no?

746
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
Oh, I like the ones that dance for me.

747
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,540
This one dances.

748
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

749
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh, they all dance.

750
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,640
Oh!

751
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,810
Not really that important.

752
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,490
Oh, it's not important at all?

753
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:04,910
Oh!

754
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,310
Um...

755
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,350
Not at all.

756
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,510
Austin, Nadia!

757
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,910
Oh, thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

758
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:18,610
Thank you!

759
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,310
It's only con...

760
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,690
It determines stats.

761
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,290
Well, there was...

762
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,070
Wait, um...

763
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,010
So this one, the wood elf.

764
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,970
I want to command a simple creature.

765
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,910
I think that sounds fun.

766
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,750
But also...

767
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,370
Was it you?

768
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,550
Good at picking locks.

769
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,090
Can breathe underwater.

770
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,190
That's pretty huge.

771
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,730
And then...

772
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,530
Natural resistance to disease and poison.

773
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,210
I mean, there's probably a lot of disease here, no?

774
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,770
The wood elves are carnivores that eat people.

775
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,410
Wait, what?

776
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,760
Diseases don't do much.

777
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,260
Wait, these are cannibals?

778
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,580
They're friendly cannibals!

779
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
You spent your child...

780
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,840
Oh wait, origin.

781
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,440
You spent your childhood in Grotwood.

782
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,500
Near the region devastated by Molagbal.

783
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,780
The foul energies still linger there and your resilience grew amidst the danger.

784
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,860
The border region that saw you grow is plagued by anger and resentment after centuries of war.

785
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,400
You quickly learned how to soothe people and avoid unnecessary conflicts.

786
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
No, no.

787
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,760
I want to cause conflicts.

788
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,620
I want to cause conflicts.

789
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,260
I want to cause conflicts.

790
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,380
I don't know.

791
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm feeling wood elf.

792
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,410
I can't imagine conclusiveness.

793
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,910
Oh wait, there's stats!

794
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,600
Bad intelligence.

795
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,620
Lots of strength...

796
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:05,740
Wait.

797
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,960
Who has the best luck?

798
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,480
Wait...

799
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:11,910
Magicka...

800
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,360
Ooooooooo!

801
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,020
Oh.

802
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,820
They all have the same luck.

803
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,380
Why is your willpower so low?

804
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,280
He's just like, yeah.

805
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,720
I give in.

806
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,560
I give in.

807
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,120
Maybe.

808
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,260
Well, the strength is not very high.

809
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,060
If I get myself into trouble.

810
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,260
But I can just book it.

811
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,620
I can just leave.

812
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Hand to hand.

813
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,300
We got some CQC.

814
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,220
Acrobat.

815
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Sneak 15.

816
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,600
But who needs sneak if you just got brute strength?

817
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,000
A dice roll isn't bad if you are overwhelmed.

818
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,460
I think I am overwhelmed.

819
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,060
I think I am overwhelmed.

820
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,060
Let's see.

821
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,480
Roll.

822
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,740
Dice.

823
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,100
One.

824
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,560
Through.

825
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,540
Ten.

826
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,100
Roll.

827
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,100
One.

828
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,440
It wants me to be a lizard.

829
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,140
But.

830
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,090
I was going to make my character really anime.

831
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,250
Remember how I mentioned I never played these games before?

832
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,670
Because they weren't anime enough.

833
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,910
I was going to make them really anime.

834
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,490
I feel like you can't customize your character as a lizard.

835
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,810
No.

836
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,770
Can you?

837
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,790
Can you?

838
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:10,850
Can you?

839
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,230
You can?

840
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,250
Hold on.

841
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,090
Oh!

842
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,210
Let's see.

843
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:16,430
Oh.

844
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,490
Okay.

845
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,790
Let's see.

846
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,850
I can be kind.

847
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,490
Or stern.

848
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:22,610
Turn.

849
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,130
Oh!

850
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:24,750
Ooh!

851
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,250
Ooh!

852
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:25,710
Ooh!

853
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,050
Ooh!

854
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:26,670
Oh!

855
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,750
Ooh!

856
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,010
Ooh!

857
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,190
Ooh!

858
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,130
Ooh!

859
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,130
Ooh!

860
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,350
Ooh!

861
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,910
Oooh!!

862
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:42,150
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hh-hm-hm sing-hm-hm.

863
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,610
Round.

864
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,700
The cheekbones.

865
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,080
Whoa!

866
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,660
It's really weird watching them move through the face!

867
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,680
You!

868
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Ohh!

869
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:54,760
Oh.

870
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,480
Thin wide.

871
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,660
Thin wide.

872
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,980
Pick a body first.

873
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,180
Body type.

874
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,200
Oh, it can be old.

875
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,600
What the?

876
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,020
Oh.

877
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:15,180
I was like... Suddenly, I developed the best skincare routine known to Argonian.

878
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,860
Argonian.

879
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,660
Argonian maids are very popular in lore.

880
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,120
Oh, yeah.

881
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,660
Mogu talked about that.

882
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,580
Why?

883
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,780
It's so funny.

884
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,120
Wait, can I zoom in?

885
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:29,820
No.

886
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,700
Type 2, type 1.

887
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,940
Oh.

888
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,200
Oh.

889
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,280
Oh my god.

890
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,280
The skincare routine.

891
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,200
Drop it, queen.

892
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,840
Drop it.

893
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,600
Nothing even changes when I become old.

894
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:52,020
Just like... It's like when dogs become old and their snout is a little more white.

895
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,460
Hmm.

896
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:57,600
Hmm.

897
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,660
Hmm.

898
00:36:59,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Hmm.

899
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Hmm.

900
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,440
Hmm.

901
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,030
Hmm.

902
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,290
I still don't know, guys.

903
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,930
Wait, now we're ladies.

904
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:08,890
Oh.

905
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,790
Oh my god.

906
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,770
Female cat.

907
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,370
Hmm.

908
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:22,530
Hmm.

909
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,550
Hmm.

910
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,110
Hmm.

911
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,070
I still... I don't know.

912
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,930
Do I go with the wood elf?

913
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,090
I'm self-pulled.

914
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,910
Cat girl.

915
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,930
You guys are such freaks.

916
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,130
You guys are such freaks.

917
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,230
Did I miss a birthday?

918
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,230
Say hi and ask if I could get a quick happy birthday.

919
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,530
Zelda stuck!

920
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,030
Happy birthday!

921
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,650
Happy birthday to you!

922
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,410
Thank you so much for this every time.

923
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,470
Have a happy birthday.

924
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,360
We could be Shrek Fiona.

925
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,200
I think I'm gonna go with the wood elf, you guys.

926
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,560
Oh my god.

927
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,540
Anime haircut.

928
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,400
Okay.

929
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,480
Okay.

930
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm gonna go with the wood elf.

931
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,470
People will call you short.

932
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,910
Wait, what do you mean by that?

933
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,770
In the game?

934
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,210
Old.

935
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,070
Young.

936
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,950
We're gonna be... We're gonna be... We're gonna be a fresh-faced little elf.

937
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,090
Wood elves are short.

938
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,990
Oh my

939
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,400
god.

940
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,140
Thank you so much.

941
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,920
Thank you so much.

942
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,180
Thanks.

943
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,900
I don't know what this is in response to.

944
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,040
Because it was from 10 minutes ago.

945
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,180
But thanks, Phil!

946
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,740
You want a hag elf?

947
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,600
We can make her a little haggard.

948
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,840
Like that.

949
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,380
I kind of maybe want her a little tan.

950
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,400
She's... She's like a gyaru type.

951
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,000
Let's see.

952
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,700
All right.

953
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,520
Oh yeah, baby.

954
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,100
Oh yeah, baby.

955
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,700
Let's see.

956
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Oh.

957
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,580
We're gonna... Okay.

958
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,400
Time to make our super-duper cute anime girl.

959
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,620
Oh my gosh.

960
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,840
Look how cute she is already.

961
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh.

962
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,140
Oh.

963
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,160
She's... She's like... Oh.

964
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,020
She... This... This girl would have toast in her mouth run into school.

965
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,680
Well, she doesn't go... 10 years ago.

966
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,160
All right.

967
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,480
Hold on.

968
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,280
The eyes are the most important part, though.

969
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,660
Large.

970
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,460
Large.

971
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:52,900
That's it?

972
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,860
That's as large as they go?

973
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,100
No.

974
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,380
No.

975
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,280
No.

976
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,220
No.

977
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,260
No.

978
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,940
Larger.

979
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,180
Larger.

980
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,760
Larger.

981
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,200
Larger.

982
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,700
Larger.

983
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Larger.

984
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,040
No!

985
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,740
Why are their eyes so red?

986
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,440
It's... Ooh.

987
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,880
Why are their eyes so red?

988
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,600
It's freaky.

989
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,190
Click the number.

990
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,390
What number?

991
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,590
There is no number.

992
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,250
Click the number, you can... type... custom sizes.

993
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,750
Oh, this?!

994
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,770
Oh, maybe we change our plans then.

995
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,870
I was gonna have her be the cutest... the cutest!

996
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,630
Okay, next.

997
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:26,490
Now, I'm gonna make... E.T.

998
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,850
I need a reference photo.

999
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,650
Okay.

1000
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,850
So far, not so bad.

1001
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,530
Okay, hold on.

1002
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,910
Let's start... let's start with the brows.

1003
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,590
We'll go back to the brows.

1004
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,610
We need them... we need them wide and high, baby.

1005
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,590
Nope.

1006
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,870
Downwards is good.

1007
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,470
Is good.

1008
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,010
Okay.

1009
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:03,830
Con... not so much concave, but a little more round because we're gonna have it come down...

1010
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,030
Wait, should I change my body type?

1011
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,170
Are we gonna be sexy E.T.?

1012
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:16,200
If you made her the cutest, she'd just be you.

1013
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,700
Stop.

1014
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,540
Cheekbones... high.

1015
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,360
And... It's hard to tell.

1016
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,900
Wait, let me change her hair real quick.

1017
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,220
Head.

1018
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,660
Wait.

1019
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,280
Hair.

1020
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,060
Here, hold on.

1021
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,400
E.T.

1022
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,140
is bald.

1023
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,260
Okay, okay.

1024
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:38,640
Okay, okay.

1025
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,240
This is looking good.

1026
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,460
Ah!

1027
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Okay, okay, hold on.

1028
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,080
Back to the head.

1029
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,420
Okay.

1030
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:47,920
Brows.

1031
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,220
Okay.

1032
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,360
I wish I could... Oh!

1033
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,620
Oh, that's the tone.

1034
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,040
Never mind.

1035
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,540
Hmm... It's just a little more curved in.

1036
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Yeah.

1037
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,500
Oh, wait.

1038
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,500
This might work.

1039
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
No, I still think this looks better.

1040
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,840
E.T.s are more round.

1041
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,040
E.T.

1042
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,940
is more round.

1043
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,040
I think.

1044
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,700
Can we get bald Minto to match?

1045
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,440
You would want that, wouldn't you?

1046
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,000
You would want that.

1047
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,900
How do I make my head bigger?

1048
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,620
Hmm...

1049
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,100
I'm looking at E.T.

1050
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,140
I'm looking at E.T.

1051
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,420
It's not... I wish I could expand this part.

1052
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,480
Wide.

1053
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,280
Oh!

1054
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,900
Oh my god.

1055
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,520
Wait, then?

1056
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,180
Oh my god.

1057
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,220
Like so.

1058
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,140
Yes.

1059
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:47,880
Yes.

1060
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,020
Yes.

1061
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,840
Yes.

1062
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,540
Yes.

1063
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,100
Yes.

1064
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,100
I think it's more in the middle.

1065
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Yes.

1066
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:56,700
Yes.

1067
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,240
And E.T.

1068
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,980
has these beautiful blue eyes.

1069
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,020
E.T.

1070
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,020
is...

1071
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,680
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1072
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,460
Oh, wow.

1073
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,580
E.T.

1074
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,400
is...

1075
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,720
Um...

1076
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,340
Oh my god!

1077
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,180
I'm...

1078
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm...

1079
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm...

1080
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,320
I have...

1081
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,040
I have scurvy or something.

1082
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,040
Wait, I can be...

1083
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,660
Blue?

1084
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:22,760
Pink?

1085
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,020
Pink!

1086
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,700
Oh no.

1087
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,660
I can be mint.

1088
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,380
None of these are E.T.

1089
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,420
The eyes are so red.

1090
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:49,880
I know.

1091
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,540
Bruised?

1092
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,860
Why are they bruised?

1093
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,040
But E.T.

1094
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,740
has got some crazy wrinkles.

1095
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,220
You know what?

1096
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,620
Let's...

1097
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,440
Let's make them old.

1098
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,040
More E.T.

1099
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,380
like.

1100
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,000
Very good!

1101
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,820
Thank you for the gift.

1102
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,400
Thank you!

1103
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,380
E.T.

1104
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,140
Phone home.

1105
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,760
Flushed.

1106
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,640
Freckles!

1107
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,980
Can't even see them.

1108
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,800
I'm way too old.

1109
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,860
I'm way too old.

1110
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,920
Do you guys see the vision?

1111
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,460
Yeah, you see the vision?

1112
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,460
Do you see it?

1113
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,300
Do you see the vision?

1114
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,840
Actually, this looks more like E.T.'s eyes.

1115
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,620
E.T.

1116
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,640
doesn't have ears?

1117
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,060
Oh!

1118
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,340
There's no ear customization?

1119
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,400
E.T.

1120
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,340
also does not have a chin.

1121
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,020
But like that, I think would be...

1122
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,140
Wait.

1123
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,180
Nah, I think like that is good.

1124
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,220
Like...

1125
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,180
E.T.'s got a really long neck.

1126
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,700
Nah...

1127
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,900
And then...

1128
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,060
Like...

1129
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,960
Uh...

1130
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,760
I'll do wide.

1131
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,680
No!

1132
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,380
Not wide.

1133
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,660
I lied.

1134
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:24,920
I died.

1135
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,680
I lied.

1136
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,920
I lied.

1137
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,400
I lied.

1138
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,000
Um...

1139
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,050
Does anybody...

1140
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,090
When do you ever even get to see my character?

1141
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,070
Isn't it...

1142
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:44,950
Isn't it not...

1143
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,470
Is it not a first-person game?

1144
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,510
Why do they look so upset?

1145
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,690
Dobby!

1146
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,530
It does kind of look like Dobby.

1147
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,070
It does kind of look like Dobby.

1148
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,740
Do you guys see the vision, though?

1149
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,520
I think I'm really...

1150
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,220
I think I'm really...

1151
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,960
Actually starting to see the vision.

1152
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,040
I

1153
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,260
think I'm actually really starting...

1154
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,300
Oh gosh.

1155
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,560
I wish I didn't...

1156
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,380
I wish I didn't...

1157
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,900
Hold on...

1158
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,600
Look, look, look.

1159
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,760
Tilt it up...

1160
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,440
And thin...

1161
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:51,600
No.

1162
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,160
Wide.

1163
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,380
Oh my god.

1164
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,180
Oh my god.

1165
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,280
What's a Cellion?

1166
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,940
Oh, I've never even heard of that before.

1167
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,880
E.T.

1168
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,340
Fun home.

1169
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,980
E.T.

1170
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,120
Fun home.

1171
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,740
What does E.T.

1172
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,020
look like from the side?

1173
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,280
You know what?

1174
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:20,840
It doesn't matter.

1175
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,490
I've never played any Elder Scrolls.

1176
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,290
I'm looking forward to watching your mods.

1177
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:31,910
Because I applied for an internal promotion.

1178
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,370
So cool!

1179
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:34,590
You got this.

1180
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,410
You got this.

1181
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,050
You got this.

1182
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,150
I kind of want the eyes to be...

1183
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,940
Like, definitely down.

1184
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,260
But they look too bored.

1185
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,200
You know?

1186
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,520
Maybe if I can do the brows.

1187
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,800
More like that, maybe.

1188
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,800
More like that helps.

1189
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,500
I wish they were more...

1190
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,720
Pronounced.

1191
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,240
You know?

1192
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,400
How is this cursed?

1193
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,460
It's E.T.

1194
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Who doesn't...

1195
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,060
Do you guys know the E.T.

1196
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,480
ride?

1197
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,160
At Universal.

1198
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,940
And then you tell it...

1199
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,640
You say...

1200
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,320
I guess at the beginning you say...

1201
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,160
What your name is.

1202
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
And at the end of the ride...

1203
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,300
It will say like...

1204
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,920
Thank you.

1205
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,460
And then say...

1206
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,480
The ride...

1207
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,380
Can we get a side-by-side?

1208
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah!

1209
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,940
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1210
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,400
And so people will like...

1211
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,220
Go and say like...

1212
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:36,960
Their name is Jeff.

1213
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,320
But like the entire cart.

1214
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:38,900
And so...

1215
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,880
And so E.T.

1216
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,100
will just be like...

1217
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,860
Thank you.

1218
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,920
Jeff.

1219
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,820
Jeff.

1220
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,920
Jeff.

1221
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,020
Jeff.

1222
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,000
E.T.

1223
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,040
Oh my...

1224
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,680
Okay, this is the picture I've been basing it off of.

1225
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,260
No!

1226
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,240
I want to...

1227
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,540
I want to create this first.

1228
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,380
I want to create this first.

1229
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,760
And then I will show you.

1230
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,340
Wait, the forehead.

1231
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,660
Oh!

1232
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,740
Oh my god!

1233
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,120
It's all really coming together.

1234
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,200
Actually, strangely enough...

1235
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:20,460
E.T.

1236
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,200
does not really have that big of a head.

1237
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,120
Like a forehead.

1238
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,430
This actually looks so normal.

1239
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:33,750
What was it before?

1240
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,230
Yeah.

1241
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,390
Now it's like...

1242
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,210
It's really coming together.

1243
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,490
Okay, and then the mouth.

1244
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,470
Wait, did I do face?

1245
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:43,610
Oh!

1246
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:44,710
Oh!

1247
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:45,310
Oh!

1248
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,450
Oh my god!

1249
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,350
It's E.T!

1250
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,830
Wait, what is this forehead?

1251
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:04,760
Oh.

1252
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,100
No, E.T.'s is actually kind of concave.

1253
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,560
It seems.

1254
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:18,740
Hmm.

1255
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,500
Okay.

1256
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,340
Mouth.

1257
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,220
Purse.

1258
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,460
Happy!

1259
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,060
And we'll do lower?

1260
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,060
Oh.

1261
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,300
Protruding.

1262
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,460
It's pretty normal.

1263
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,240
It's pretty average.

1264
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,580
Happy!

1265
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,300
Happy!

1266
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:38,860
Happy!

1267
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,700
Happy!

1268
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,200
E .T!

1269
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:41,940
Happy!

1270
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:47,610
No.

1271
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,290
I wish.

1272
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,350
Mouth.

1273
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:51,730
Chin.

1274
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:52,430
Distance.

1275
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,610
Very short.

1276
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,650
No, no.

1277
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:56,490
Okay.

1278
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,730
We gotta keep it the way it is then.

1279
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,310
Lips.

1280
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,110
Deflated.

1281
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:00,970
Inflated.

1282
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,530
E.T.

1283
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:02,610
E.T.

1284
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:03,530
doesn't really have lips.

1285
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,690
So let's do...

1286
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,970
Let's do this.

1287
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,090
A bit.

1288
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,690
Don't look at the size.

1289
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:11,350
Oh.

1290
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,790
Do that.

1291
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,470
I'm not puckered for sure.

1292
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,330
You look like an apple.

1293
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,170
I left in the first...

1294
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,970
It's not me!

1295
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,330
It's E.T.

1296
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,070
It's E.T.

1297
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,090
Let's also...

1298
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,490
I'm gonna pick...

1299
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,650
Um...

1300
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,260
Oh my god.

1301
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:40,920
Wow.

1302
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,580
That actually really suits her.

1303
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,050
I want them piercing blue eyes.

1304
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,430
You know?

1305
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,130
No, not piercing enough.

1306
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,210
Like, I want people to look at E.T.

1307
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,210
and be like...

1308
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,170
Oh, you have blue eyes.

1309
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,910
Like the meme?

1310
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,170
Exactly like the meme.

1311
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,770
I want to get rid of the...

1312
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:15,670
The eyelid.

1313
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,110
The red eyelid.

1314
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,530
It's freaking me out.

1315
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,210
Yeah, this is good.

1316
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:25,870
This is good.

1317
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,190
Eyeshadow color...

1318
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,030
None.

1319
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,330
Wow!

1320
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,450
Wow.

1321
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,050
Ooh-wee!

1322
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:35,870
E.T.

1323
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,210
be styling...

1324
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,030
Sheer lipstick.

1325
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,210
Or...

1326
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,850
I guess we are doing sexy E.T.

1327
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,610
So maybe...

1328
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,170
Our eyeshadow color...

1329
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,570
What would be a sexy...

1330
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,090
Color?

1331
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,470
When you think of sexy color...

1332
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:53,350
Mint?

1333
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:53,870
Oh my gosh.

1334
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,990
You guys are so right.

1335
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,220
No, I kind of don't like it.

1336
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,020
I think I kind of want to just be regular E.T.

1337
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,260
Oh, goth E.T.

1338
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,880
Nah, I think I'll just be regular E.T.

1339
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,880
I'm not just regular.

1340
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,320
Okay, let me show you the image...

1341
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,680
That I've been basing this off of.

1342
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,060
Oh, I already have...

1343
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,800
I already saved it.

1344
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:32,780
Okay.

1345
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,200
Glup...

1346
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,240
Sheet-o?

1347
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,740
No, no.

1348
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,600
You're mistaken.

1349
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,140
You're mistaken!

1350
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,960
Okay, here we go.

1351
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,240
Ready?

1352
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,680
Three, two, one...

1353
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,590
E.T.

1354
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:03,850
Phone hub...

1355
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:03,850
E .T.

1356
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:04,610
phone hub...

1357
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,660
How did you nail this?

1358
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,740
Woohoo!

1359
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,360
E.T.

1360
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:28,080
The only thing that's bothering me are the ears.

1361
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,580
And I wish I could make the forehead like a little bit more concave.

1362
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,940
You know?

1363
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,200
Or like right here?

1364
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,800
It's not the forehead though.

1365
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,300
It's like just the head.

1366
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,660
It's not the cheeks.

1367
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,980
The face.

1368
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,740
No.

1369
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,840
Can the brows be bigger?

1370
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,320
No!

1371
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,300
I can't make the brows bigger eyes.

1372
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,040
I don't think so.

1373
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,060
Hold on.

1374
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:01,900
Bro.

1375
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,100
Yeah, no.

1376
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,920
They can't be bigger.

1377
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,780
Bigger eyes?

1378
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,600
I can't.

1379
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,040
They're as big as they can be.

1380
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,160
It's just...

1381
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,560
We're just gonna have to understand that E.T.

1382
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,760
Super bushy brow.

1383
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,000
Well, should I like restart on an orc or something?

1384
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,640
Needs white sclera.

1385
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,720
I don't have that though.

1386
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,420
Maybe red would be better.

1387
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,840
Oh, actually that looks better.

1388
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,600
That actually does look better.

1389
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,980
Than this one.

1390
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,580
Like it was...

1391
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,480
This before...

1392
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:53,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1393
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,840
We'll go with this.

1394
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,380
Wait, where'd I go?

1395
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,500
This one.

1396
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,240
I can't believe E.T.

1397
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,100
came to Earth...

1398
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,440
And they experimented on him...

1399
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,560
And cut off his ears.

1400
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,480
This is E.T.

1401
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,880
before that all happens.

1402
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,040
Done.

1403
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,670
Okay.

1404
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,050
I think I'm ready to start the game.

1405
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,460
Don't need to do hair.

1406
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,180
A little darker, maybe.

1407
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,320
E.T.

1408
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,260
No hair.

1409
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,000
No.

1410
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,980
Wait, I could...

1411
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,300
Hair tip color?

1412
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,540
Wait a second.

1413
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,320
Hold on.

1414
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,280
How does the E.T.

1415
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,140
song go again?

1416
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,540
That's...

1417
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,280
Jurassic Park.

1418
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,580
Wait a second.

1419
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Wait, isn't there a part of the movie...

1420
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,940
Where E.T.

1421
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,840
Where's a wig?

1422
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,490
Wait.

1423
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,290
Hold on.

1424
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,190
I'm gonna pull it up.

1425
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,790
I'm gonna pull up a picture.

1426
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,610
It's too...

1427
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:48,690
Too perfect.

1428
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,370
Oh.

1429
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,330
I think I have to go with...

1430
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:57,650
Wait.

1431
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,590
Which one do you guys think?

1432
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,030
I feel like the Karen cut just...

1433
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,670
It's not accurate, but it just works.

1434
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,310
I can't...

1435
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:12,810
Which one?

1436
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,630
This is one...

1437
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,590
The E.T.

1438
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,270
Phone manager.

1439
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,690
Oh, it does hide the ears.

1440
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:25,650
Oh my god.

1441
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,430
Well, they both do.

1442
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,820
It looks so good.

1443
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,720
I can't get over it for me.

1444
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,860
This is...

1445
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,560
You can make it longer.

1446
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,020
Oh.

1447
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,200
Woo.

1448
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,300
Woo.

1449
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,530
Short.

1450
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,390
Long.

1451
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:08,790
Wait.

1452
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,770
How does this get longer?

1453
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:11,590
Oh.

1454
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:12,490
That's strange.

1455
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,730
Nothing happens.

1456
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,810
No.

1457
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:19,510
I think...

1458
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:19,910
Oh my gosh.

1459
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,930
The wig was literally the final touch.

1460
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,470
Oh my gosh.

1461
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,890
It's too good.

1462
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,490
It's too good.

1463
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,010
But I wanted to see the...

1464
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:33,150
Okay.

1465
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,310
It was just...

1466
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:34,450
Okay.

1467
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,170
Remember it's this brown, you guys.

1468
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,010
Because it's already...

1469
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,210
It's already like the perfect color.

1470
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,130
I just wanted to see how...

1471
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,110
If we can make it...

1472
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,850
Like Minto, you know?

1473
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,550
Tip color.

1474
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,150
That's not the hair tip.

1475
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,430
Salt and pepper.

1476
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:53,530
What's that mean?

1477
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:57,850
Eyebrow color.

1478
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,130
Wait.

1479
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,250
There we go.

1480
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:00,670
Wait.

1481
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:01,970
Maybe we can...

1482
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,130
Do...

1483
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,930
Maybe like a little bit of shadowing, you know?

1484
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,140
Doesn't really do much.

1485
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,160
Hmm.

1486
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,100
A little graying.

1487
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,540
Oh!

1488
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,960
Oh!

1489
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:17,400
Oh!

1490
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:17,580
Oh!

1491
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:17,980
Oh!

1492
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:18,120
Oh!

1493
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,260
I get it.

1494
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,620
Gradient contrast.

1495
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,720
I don't see...

1496
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,380
Oh!

1497
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,720
I do see a difference, actually.

1498
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,100
Like, this looks more blended, I think.

1499
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,200
And this is where you can see the mint gradient amount.

1500
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,620
Whoa!

1501
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,520
Whoa, whoa.

1502
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,480
If we do...

1503
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,120
If you do like that...

1504
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,820
Minto!

1505
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,480
Oh!

1506
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,040
Mike knows many things.

1507
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,020
Mike knows many ghosts who relive their lives each day.

1508
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,380
Mike sees a ghost playing a game, wonders if she plays the same game again or new one.

1509
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:58,700
Yes.

1510
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,140
All right.

1511
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,290
All right.

1512
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:06,970
E.T.

1513
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,730
Everybody.

1514
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,210
Give it up for...

1515
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,530
Wait.

1516
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,070
Actually, maybe this color is better.

1517
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,850
No, no, no.

1518
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,550
It's a little more sandy, right?

1519
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,930
It's a little more sandy of a blonde.

1520
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,970
We'll do go darker, too.

1521
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,090
There.

1522
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:27,850
I think that's better.

1523
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,030
I think that's better.

1524
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,380
Perfect!

1525
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,480
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

1526
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,740
Salt and pepper, zero.

1527
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,020
We want to...

1528
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:45,300
Okay.

1529
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,240
All right.

1530
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,720
All right.

1531
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,840
Are we ready to...

1532
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,840
Are we ready to...

1533
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,640
To...

1534
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,100
I...

1535
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:00,360
Hold on.

1536
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:00,820
I don't want to see.

1537
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,920
No, I still think this one...

1538
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,360
E.T.

1539
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,400
phone manager.

1540
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,460
Character's name.

1541
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:12,660
E.T.

1542
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,400
E.T.

1543
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,200
E.T.

1544
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,700
Wait.

1545
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,500
How can we...

1546
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,340
How can we...

1547
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,840
How can we make...

1548
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,000
How can we make it cute?

1549
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,230
How can we make it like a cute like...

1550
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,230
Minty?

1551
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,410
No, no, no.

1552
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:34,470
E.T.

1553
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,550
That's perfect.

1554
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:37,290
E.T.

1555
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,570
E.T.

1556
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,750
E .T.

1557
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:42,970
E.T.

1558
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:43,110
E.T.

1559
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:43,210
E.T.

1560
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:43,470
E.T.

1561
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:43,550
E .T.

1562
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,170
E.T.

1563
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,890
E .T.

1564
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,710
Improved endurance.

1565
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,190
Name cannot... Oh.

1566
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:50,770
Wait.

1567
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:51,590
Oh.

1568
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:56,250
Okay, it has to be... It has to be like that.

1569
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,370
E-T-ina.

1570
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,450
E-T-ina.

1571
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,550
There we go.

1572
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,710
Yay!

1573
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,150
E-T!

1574
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,010
Are you sure?

1575
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:13,730
Yes.

1576
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,450
Where am I?

1577
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,490
Am I in jail?

1578
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,270
Press shift.

1579
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,010
Oh, to sprint, left shift.

1580
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,250
I feel like I'm already so fast.

1581
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:30,990
Oh my god.

1582
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,370
Hi.

1583
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:35,450
Not a little far from the forest, huh?

1584
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:42,010
Looks like your days of woodland frolicking have come to a tragic end.

1585
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:48,970
To go from the gladed realm of Valenwood to a rat-infested hoe like this.

1586
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,710
How very sad.

1587
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:51,690
What am I in for?

1588
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:55,530
Those walls must feel like they're closing in on you.

1589
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:57,030
Yeah.

1590
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,550
Pretty soon, you'll go mad.

1591
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:02,610
And the guards will cut your throat just to stop the ranting.

1592
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:03,930
That's right.

1593
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,570
You're going to die in here, Woodell.

1594
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:06,870
No.

1595
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:07,570
Die.

1596
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,090
E-T needs to go home.

1597
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,570
Hey, you hear that?

1598
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,130
The guards are coming.

1599
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,010
For you.

1600
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,870
Hee hee hee hee ha ha.

1601
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,030
Hee hee ha.

1602
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:17,350
Or lock that door behind us.

1603
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,070
No, I'm fine.

1604
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,090
I'm eavesdropping.

1605
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,170
The messenger only said they were attacked.

1606
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,490
No, they're dead.

1607
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:30,610
Hee hee ha.

1608
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:31,410
I know it.

1609
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,770
What's this prisoner doing here?

1610
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,850
This cell is supposed to be off limits.

1611
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,730
There's nobody in here.

1612
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,590
Usual mix up with the watch.

1613
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:39,870
I...

1614
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:40,510
Never mind.

1615
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:41,550
Get that gate open.

1616
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,350
Yes, please.

1617
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,550
Stand back, prisoner.

1618
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:43,950
Oh.

1619
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,250
We won't hesitate to kill you if you get in our way.

1620
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:46,570
Okay.

1621
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,210
No sign of pursuit, sir.

1622
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,310
Stay put, prisoner.

1623
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:52,610
Good.

1624
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,370
Let's go.

1625
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,990
We're not out of this yet.

1626
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,570
What's happening?

1627
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:57,470
You...

1628
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,350
I've seen you.

1629
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,290
Yeah, I'm from that famous movie.

1630
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:01,910
Let me see your face.

1631
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,410
You are the one from my dreams.

1632
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:04,850
Oh!

1633
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,970
Then the stars were right.

1634
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,350
And this is the day.

1635
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,490
Gods give me strength.

1636
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:13,570
Oh.

1637
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,210
What's going on?

1638
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,350
Assassins attacked my sons, and I am next.

1639
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,010
My blades are leading me out of the city along a secret escape route.

1640
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:23,930
I'm not gonna let this guy die.

1641
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,130
By chance, the entrance to that escape route leads through your cell.

1642
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:28,890
Oh.

1643
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,910
Um, why am I in jail?

1644
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:34,930
Perhaps the gods have placed you here so that we may meet.

1645
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,270
As for what you have done, it does not matter.

1646
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:38,750
Oh, okay.

1647
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,310
Cool.

1648
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,790
That is not what you will be remembered for.

1649
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,730
Everybody in my village, probably.

1650
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:51,530
I'll be remembered for my famous movie directed by Steven Spielberg, E.T.

1651
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,570
Extraterrestrial.

1652
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,130
Yeah, and I ate them.

1653
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:57,770
Who are you?

1654
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,870
I am your emperor, Uriel Septim.

1655
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:05,330
By the grace of the gods, I serve Tamriel as her ruler.

1656
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:10,690
You are a citizen of Tamriel, and you too shall serve her in your own way.

1657
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:13,010
He looks like my dad.

1658
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,370
Like, like E.T.'s dad.

1659
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,450
Like, you know, with the eyes.

1660
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,690
Not like my, my actual dad.

1661
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,090
Um, what should I do?

1662
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,630
You will find your own path.

1663
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,130
Take care.

1664
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,190
There will be blood and death before the end.

1665
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,430
Please, sire.

1666
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,550
We must keep moving.

1667
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,530
That's, that's, that's, that's, um, Jean-Luc Picard!

1668
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:37,970
Whoa.

1669
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:39,790
Better not close this one.

1670
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,850
There's no way to open it from the other side.

1671
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:42,310
Okay.

1672
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,510
This doesn't concern you, prisoner.

1673
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,610
Looks like this is your lucky day.

1674
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,470
Just stay out of our way.

1675
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:47,850
Okay.

1676
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,030
So I get to leave, or?

1677
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,950
See ya, bozo.

1678
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,150
Take a bone.

1679
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,010
Wait.

1680
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:57,990
How do I take that bone?

1681
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:00,570
Take that skull.

1682
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:01,790
Take this other bone.

1683
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:02,590
Take this other bone.

1684
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,230
Can he get way down in this game for taking too many bones, or?

1685
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,040
Holy cow!

1686
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,020
Oh, you can?

1687
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:15,520
Okay.

1688
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,000
I just won't take so many.

1689
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,280
Um, how do I get up?

1690
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,940
Wait, I think I, oh, there we go.

1691
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,420
Okay, phew.

1692
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,880
Um, okay.

1693
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:24,840
I'm on my way.

1694
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,800
Here we go.

1695
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,180
It's kind of spooky down here.

1696
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,740
How do I open my inventory?

1697
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,080
Inventory.

1698
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,060
Empty?

1699
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:35,820
What are you talking about?

1700
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,060
Oh.

1701
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,180
My gear.

1702
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,320
I gotta say, I have so many bones.

1703
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,100
I can't equip it.

1704
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,000
I think it's a weapon, no?

1705
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,560
Oh.

1706
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,680
What's over here?

1707
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,500
Nothing.

1708
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,220
Is this place booby-trapped?

1709
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,800
Is she playing E.T.?

1710
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,000
Yeah.

1711
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,200
Oh!

1712
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,200
Gosh, they're slow.

1713
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,440
Close up left.

1714
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,600
Protect the Emperor.

1715
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,480
What's happening?

1716
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,520
Protect yourself.

1717
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,340
I don't have anything.

1718
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,760
How do I protect myself?

1719
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,880
Are you alright, sire?

1720
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,980
We're clear for now.

1721
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,060
Captain Reno?

1722
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,260
She's dead.

1723
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,260
Oh my god!

1724
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:21,800
It's fine, sire.

1725
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,180
But we have to keep moving.

1726
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:23,520
Oh.

1727
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,560
Shh, shh, shh.

1728
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,380
Uh.

1729
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,220
I'll take that.

1730
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,320
How could they be waiting for us here?

1731
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:29,400
Uh.

1732
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:30,340
Yoink.

1733
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:30,980
Yoink.

1734
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:31,400
Yoink.

1735
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,200
Take off?

1736
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,900
Don't know, but it's too late to go back now.

1737
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,920
They probably don't care, right?

1738
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,260
Don't worry, sire.

1739
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,540
We will get you out of here.

1740
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,780
Her corpse and eat it?

1741
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,480
Which?

1742
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah!

1743
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:47,740
Whoa!

1744
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,980
I got a katana!

1745
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,320
They won't be the first to underestimate the blades.

1746
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,360
I'll take point.

1747
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,160
Let's move.

1748
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,300
You stay here, prisoner.

1749
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,760
Don't try to follow us.

1750
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,580
Why not?

1751
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,620
Oh.

1752
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,920
To ready your weapon, press F.

1753
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,620
To attack, press left.

1754
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,620
Okay, that's what I have.

1755
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,160
Wait.

1756
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:08,640
Oh!

1757
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,160
Oh, it's a rat!

1758
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,660
Oh, there's multiple rats!

1759
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,060
I'm blocking.

1760
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,960
I can search the rat.

1761
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:24,460
Rat meat.

1762
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,680
I'll have you know.

1763
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,940
I will take everything for now.

1764
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,080
Can I eat it?

1765
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,300
They look so fluffy.

1766
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,100
I'm, like, charming.

1767
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:38,960
Actually.

1768
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,580
So, they said don't fall.

1769
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:44,900
Oh, wait.

1770
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,000
I probably can't go this way.

1771
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,280
Yeah.

1772
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,060
I need a key.

1773
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,660
Oh, my God!

1774
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:50,520
Assassins!

1775
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,960
I didn't just notice these guys.

1776
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:53,680
Wait.

1777
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,200
If I put on their clothes, will they kill me?

1778
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,900
Will they be, like...

1779
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,300
They didn't even come with anything.

1780
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,580
How are you supposed to kill...

1781
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,720
Oh, I'll take that.

1782
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,080
What?

1783
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,260
No?

1784
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,260
They're kind of...

1785
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,320
They're kind of, like...

1786
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,780
They got fancy outfits, no?

1787
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,240
Oh!

1788
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,140
Oh, my God!

1789
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:10,580
Wait.

1790
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,480
What do you look like naked?

1791
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,820
Okay.

1792
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,420
How do I get rid of their clothes?

1793
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,720
I don't care about it.

1794
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,040
Wait.

1795
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:35,340
No!

1796
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:35,940
My wig!

1797
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:36,840
No!

1798
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:37,660
No.

1799
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,260
Wait.

1800
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:38,580
How do I...

1801
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,980
Take it off.

1802
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:39,640
E.T.

1803
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,280
Take it off.

1804
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,260
E.T.

1805
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:41,720
Remove.

1806
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:42,700
E.T.

1807
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,280
E.T.

1808
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,000
joins a cult?

1809
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,300
Shift-click.

1810
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:46,980
Oh, thank you.

1811
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,720
E.T.

1812
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:55,620
E.T.

1813
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,400
You are not decent.

1814
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,900
I kind of like the...

1815
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,260
Nah.

1816
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,460
We'll take off the...

1817
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,080
Oh, shift-click drops it.

1818
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:08,800
Oh, okay.

1819
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,080
Okay.

1820
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,440
That's fine.

1821
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:11,220
Look.

1822
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:11,800
They're just...

1823
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,380
They're just...

1824
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,340
We folded it up really neatly for them.

1825
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,960
It's nice.

1826
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,160
Don't worry about it.

1827
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:18,980
Okay.

1828
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,520
Here I go.

1829
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:21,920
What's in here?

1830
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,660
Some gold?

1831
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,820
An axe?

1832
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,200
Let's do it.

1833
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,370
A shield?

1834
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,070
A skeleton?

1835
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:39,190
Wow!

1836
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,150
He's got a lot of stuff.

1837
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,110
Holy cow.

1838
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:42,970
How many?

1839
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,010
Uh, yes.

1840
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:45,590
The boots?

1841
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:46,930
Take his clothes?

1842
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,250
I hear something.

1843
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:54,790
Now that you have arrows, pick up the bow and practice using it.

1844
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:55,970
Oh, he's coming.

1845
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:56,650
He's coming.

1846
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:57,790
I don't have time to practice!

1847
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,430
Thanks, game.

1848
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:07,450
Very easy.

1849
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:09,210
Oh!

1850
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,950
Ah!

1851
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:10,310
Hoo!

1852
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:10,590
Ha!

1853
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:13,370
If you have a lockpick, you can try to pick locks.

1854
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,750
Move the lockpick from...

1855
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,430
From...

1856
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:16,710
A...

1857
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,290
D...

1858
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,150
Press...

1859
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:18,590
Wait.

1860
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:19,550
Uh...

1861
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,070
Press W to move your mouse.

1862
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,530
Or move your mouse to move the pick upward.

1863
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,790
When the tumbler reaches the top of the lock, you will hear a metallic sound.

1864
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:28,050
Press space to secure it.

1865
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,470
When all tumblers are secured, the...

1866
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,820
Is that it?

1867
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,420
She did it.

1868
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,120
First try.

1869
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,680
Yeah?

1870
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:04,960
How many?

1871
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:05,720
Yes.

1872
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,200
Okay.

1873
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,180
Trying to see if there's any other chests in...

1874
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,180
That looks...

1875
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:18,300
New.

1876
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,000
That looks...

1877
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,020
Are you still alive, goblin shaman?

1878
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,640
Why do you have a chameleon?

1879
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,000
Is that my cousin?

1880
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:33,640
No!

1881
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,380
I'm an elf, remember?

1882
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,050
Oh, I...

1883
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,530
I...

1884
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,130
Why am I not just pressing R?

1885
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:44,090
Sorry.

1886
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,810
I'm going to...

1887
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:45,970
Oh.

1888
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:46,810
Tab.

1889
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,770
Uh...

1890
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:47,890
Oh.

1891
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:48,770
Tab is the same?

1892
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:50,710
I'm going to check my weapons.

1893
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:51,210
Let's see.

1894
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,070
We got...

1895
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,650
Oh, my katana is still the best thing we got.

1896
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,910
Oh, I'm heavy.

1897
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,090
E.T.

1898
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:02,770
E.T.

1899
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,290
is weak.

1900
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:05,750
E.T.

1901
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,170
E.T.

1902
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:07,250
E .T.

1903
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,510
Doesn't have much...

1904
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,110
Strength.

1905
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,080
You open the door.

1906
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:16,880
Okay.

1907
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,860
Oh, caps lock.

1908
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,580
Is that what...

1909
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,680
Wait, how do I...

1910
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,980
Now practice catching spells.

1911
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:27,880
Open your journal.

1912
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,600
Magic.

1913
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,360
Clairvoyance.

1914
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,980
How do I do it?

1915
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,760
Cast.

1916
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,560
Cast?

1917
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:42,840
Cast.

1918
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:44,620
See?

1919
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,940
Other tabs?

1920
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:52,820
Oh.

1921
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,640
Wait, what do you mean?

1922
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,660
Exit the inventory.

1923
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,440
Cast it by pressing C.

1924
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:06,760
Oh.

1925
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,540
Guide you towards the next step of your journey.

1926
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,420
Oh.

1927
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,760
But also, I want to...

1928
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,460
Use the...

1929
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,140
Bow and arrow.

1930
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,100
That we got.

1931
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:20,800
Where'd he go?

1932
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,100
Where'd that rack go?

1933
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,220
How do I...

1934
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:26,520
Okay.

1935
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:27,640
No.

1936
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,260
What?

1937
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,160
No, no.

1938
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:30,680
Don't see me.

1939
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
No, no, no.

1940
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,120
It's just...

1941
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,260
You have to equip the arrows.

1942
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,120
I missed.

1943
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,260
He's right in front of me.

1944
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,170
I got it.

1945
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,050
In the original Oblivion, when you got over Cumbered, you couldn't even move?

1946
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,730
No way.

1947
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:59,030
Maybe we'll get to that point.

1948
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,950
I'm so slow, though.

1949
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:05,830
We can drop some stuff.

1950
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:07,630
So, dropping...

1951
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,570
Wait.

1952
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,210
Dropping stuff is just shift-click.

1953
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,170
Should be a way to make a hotbar for spells and weapons.

1954
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:19,090
Press Caps Lock.

1955
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,290
Wait, what do you mean Caps Lock?

1956
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,270
You have trick...

1957
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,210
No, I turned...

1958
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,550
I did Caps Lock off.

1959
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:25,570
See?

1960
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,910
I am over-encumbered.

1961
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,510
You cannot carry any more items.

1962
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,010
Okay.

1963
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:37,890
My gosh.

1964
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,290
I'm working on it.

1965
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:40,730
Okay, we're gonna put on...

1966
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,550
Wow.

1967
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,050
E.T.

1968
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,930
The one thing we must never do...

1969
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:48,970
Is...

1970
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,170
The one thing we must never do is cover our face.

1971
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,370
E.T.

1972
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,210
Let's see.

1973
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,070
What do I not need?

1974
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,290
Maybe some...

1975
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:01,870
Some...

1976
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,030
Some...

1977
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,590
Rusty daggers.

1978
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,270
Um...

1979
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,030
I have three clubs!

1980
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,470
Oh, wait.

1981
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,930
I've been looking at...

1982
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:17,830
I'm stupid.

1983
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,270
I've been looking at this.

1984
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,570
Oh, this is how much they're worth, right?

1985
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,670
And then this is...

1986
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,810
How good they are?

1987
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,090
Okay, okay.

1988
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,270
Um...

1989
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:31,150
Yeah, so wait.

1990
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,910
Then why is this katana so heavy?

1991
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,370
I'm gonna get rid of one of the axes.

1992
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,910
Wait, I'm still over-encumbered!

1993
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,610
What do I have?

1994
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,430
Too much rat meat!

1995
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,090
Wait, where's my health?

1996
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:46,870
How can I...

1997
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:47,930
Is this my health down here?

1998
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,500
I got a shield.

1999
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,680
Red is health.

2000
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,360
Oh, okay.

2001
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:05,390
Diablo.

2002
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,010
Mana, health, stamina.

2003
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:10,590
Okay.

2004
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,350
The bones.

2005
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,410
Oh my gosh!

2006
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:19,650
Why are they so heavy?

2007
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,050
Oh, they're kind of heavy.

2008
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,950
Even the mugs and stuff.

2009
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:30,530
Okay!

2010
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:31,290
Oh, nope.

2011
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:32,090
Not even yet.

2012
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,490
Um...

2013
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:36,410
Uh...

2014
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,170
I don't wanna get...

2015
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:38,390
Wait.

2016
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:39,710
This is what...

2017
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:42,670
I don't wanna get rid of what I'm wearing, but...

2018
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,150
I guess it's not that much better than this, huh?

2019
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,390
It's only just by one.

2020
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,010
But it's so heavy.

2021
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,110
Drop the shield.

2022
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:54,510
Drop the clubs.

2023
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:57,030
You know what?

2024
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,030
Yeah, they are only just one.

2025
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,070
How many?

2026
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,970
Drop them.

2027
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,130
Okay.

2028
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04,190
Okay.

2029
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,110
There we go.

2030
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,090
Now we're...

2031
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,450
We're all good, baby.

2032
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:09,010
Okay.

2033
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:09,930
Maybe I should...

2034
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,930
Look, I made a mess.

2035
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,830
All my...

2036
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,970
All my litter is here.

2037
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,300
Oh!

2038
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:26,820
Oh!

2039
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:27,360
Oh!

2040
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:30,530
Oh!

2041
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:31,270
Oh, it's an army!

2042
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:32,270
Oh, it's a family!

2043
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:33,430
Oh!

2044
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:37,250
It's a zombie!

2045
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,950
Uh, they're infighting.

2046
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:40,790
Let them...

2047
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,370
Oh, never mind.

2048
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,520
There's zombies in this game!

2049
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,740
This was...

2050
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:53,760
Damage fatigue.

2051
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,060
Why are there zombies in this game?

2052
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,160
The character looks like she needs to phone home.

2053
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,340
You got it!

2054
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,200
You got it!

2055
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,220
That's my character.

2056
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:09,420
E.T.

2057
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,560
E.T.

2058
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:13,860
E.T.

2059
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,240
The Great.

2060
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,220
Why is...

2061
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,480
Why is it if I press tap?

2062
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,420
Is there like a...

2063
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:21,640
Easier way to get to inventory?

2064
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,880
I'm gonna equip my boat.

2065
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,440
Sorry.

2066
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:29,920
E.T.

2067
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,720
You guys are so right.

2068
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:33,360
E.T.

2069
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:33,640
Who?

2070
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,210
More zombies?

2071
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,040
Not on my watch.

2072
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,500
Eye for inventory.

2073
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:49,920
Okay.

2074
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,460
Thank you.

2075
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,800
You just froze there.

2076
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,020
Yeah!

2077
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:06,720
Yeah!

2078
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,460
Oh, no!

2079
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,100
Sorry.

2080
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:10,620
My bad.

2081
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,300
I wish I could pick up arrows.

2082
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,330
I wish I could pick them back up.

2083
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:19,890
Oh!

2084
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:22,710
Oh my god!

2085
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,830
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2086
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:26,230
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2087
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:27,250
Run, run, run, run, run.

2088
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:28,690
Wait.

2089
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:30,050
I shot...

2090
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,310
Not these guys.

2091
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,630
My athletics increase.

2092
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,430
Hell, yeah.

2093
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,690
Did I shoot you?

2094
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:37,130
Yeah!

2095
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,380
For now, we'll collect them.

2096
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,940
You have enough, though?

2097
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,760
Is it that 60 that I have right there?

2098
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,020
I hear something.

2099
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,740
Oh, it's a rat.

2100
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,840
What the?!

2101
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,940
I think I literally threaded the needle.

2102
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:13,030
Oops.

2103
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:16,250
I don't think it hurts to...

2104
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,110
Take it back, though, for now.

2105
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,450
You know?

2106
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,840
Oh, I'm fatigued.

2107
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,340
Take it back.

2108
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,460
Take it out!

2109
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,560
I'm fine for now, probably.

2110
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,120
Why is it so spooky?

2111
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,740
Oh, it's so spooky.

2112
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,160
There's...

2113
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,200
Now I know there's zombies here and everything.

2114
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:00,860
Uh-oh.

2115
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,580
What's going on here?

2116
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,680
It's a spooky game.

2117
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,240
Is it really?

2118
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:12,440
Ah!

2119
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:23,710
Thank you.

2120
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,830
It can get scary.

2121
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,990
Not only is that rat meat edible, you can become a master alchemist.

2122
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:34,910
By shoving everything you find down your pile.

2123
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:36,590
Really?

2124
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:38,790
I took some of it.

2125
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:40,790
I'll take it.

2126
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,490
Why not?

2127
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:43,290
Oh.

2128
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,900
Nothing gets past E.T.

2129
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,800
Nothing gets past E.T.

2130
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,400
Anything in the barrel?

2131
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,460
Nothing.

2132
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,840
Any food here?

2133
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,700
Oh, lettuce!

2134
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,600
Oh, a tomato!

2135
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,400
Not an apple!

2136
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,200
I wish I could sell the bones.

2137
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,280
What is this place?

2138
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,600
Someone's just throwing their bones and garbage down here.

2139
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,640
A rusty helmet.

2140
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,720
If I wear this...

2141
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,980
It'll cover our luscious locks.

2142
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,840
How much you carry depends on your strength.

2143
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,020
Gaining a few points...

2144
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,480
Put strength early can help the looting process.

2145
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,240
If you crouch your attacks, do bonus damage.

2146
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,030
I'm also going to switch...

2147
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,980
Back to my katana.

2148
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,790
Looking good!

2149
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:09,930
Alright.

2150
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,070
It's scary in here!

2151
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,150
My athletics increase.

2152
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:16,770
From walking?

2153
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:17,910
How...

2154
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,370
What if we started at zero?

2155
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,140
Any more zombies?

2156
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,220
Every bit helps.

2157
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,340
Eww!

2158
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,060
How many?

2159
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,060
Can I get drunk in this game?

2160
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,800
E.Tina had never walked before.

2161
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,520
Clearly!

2162
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,420
You can!

2163
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,460
What if I drink it all right now?

2164
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,190
Oh!

2165
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:06,530
Oops!

2166
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:07,050
Ouch!

2167
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,290
Oh, bad.

2168
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:11,410
I should've crouched, huh?

2169
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,690
Beer clock calls.

2170
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,450
Where is it?

2171
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:20,910
Beer?

2172
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,370
Beer?

2173
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,530
Drain intelligence on self...

2174
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,830
For 60 seconds.

2175
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:26,830
Restore fatigue!

2176
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:30,610
My willpower is being drained.

2177
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,710
My willpower is being drained.

2178
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,220
My intelligence is going down!

2179
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,900
That's a big rat!

2180
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,540
Oh!

2181
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:45,880
Oh!

2182
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:49,420
Oh!

2183
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,200
Oops!

2184
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,680
Oh, I thought my...

2185
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,900
My vision was a little...

2186
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:56,940
Oh!

2187
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,320
Oh!

2188
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,620
Skelly man!

2189
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,400
Mushrooms!

2190
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,800
Does the skelly man have anything on it?

2191
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,000
Wait!

2192
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:04,800
Why is this fresh?

2193
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,040
Who was here?

2194
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,160
The zombo?

2195
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,420
He's got some gold!

2196
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,640
He's got some gold!

2197
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,040
So happy I get to see my favorite ghost play some old school jank.

2198
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:14,880
Happy birthday!

2199
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:15,500
Happy birthday!

2200
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:16,480
Happy birthday!

2201
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,040
Aw, man.

2202
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,200
I wanna keep lick...

2203
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,640
Uh...

2204
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,420
Not licking...

2205
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,000
Pick...

2206
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:37,090
Lick...

2207
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:37,550
No.

2208
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:39,370
Pick...

2209
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:40,990
Locking!

2210
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:46,450
Taking some...

2211
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,250
Mushroom?

2212
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,330
Oh!

2213
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,810
That doesn't look good.

2214
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:50,450
Wait.

2215
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:50,870
Okay.

2216
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:51,470
Uh...

2217
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,010
We're getting into actual cult territory, I believe.

2218
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:55,250
Wait a second.

2219
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:58,390
You can shortcut items and spells.

2220
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:00,330
Yeah?

2221
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:06,030
In your journal, select an item or spell and press R to select a spot.

2222
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,570
Then use your mouse to equip your choice.

2223
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:14,110
Pressing 1 to 8 will also equip that shortcut immediately.

2224
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:19,570
The game only autosaves when you transition areas or when you open your menu every 15 minutes.

2225
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,650
Quick save with F5.

2226
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:22,650
Is that actually it?

2227
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:24,310
Oh!

2228
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:24,990
It is!

2229
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:25,530
Thank you!

2230
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:28,810
Wait.

2231
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,230
So if I...

2232
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:32,830
Do wanna...

2233
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:34,070
Mmm...

2234
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,210
Like my magic.

2235
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:39,110
What the hell is chameleon?

2236
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,770
Chameleon on self.

2237
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,490
What the hell does that do?

2238
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,970
Beast tongue.

2239
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,730
Can only be used once a day.

2240
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,030
Destruction!

2241
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:53,620
One.

2242
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,800
Flash bolt.

2243
01:29:59,380 --> 01:29:59,700
Oh no.

2244
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,380
Heal mine or wood.

2245
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,380
I guess that's important.

2246
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,620
Chameleon.

2247
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,160
Chameleon is the lesser invisible.

2248
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,080
Oh.

2249
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:15,360
Resist disease!

2250
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:17,440
Okay.

2251
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,280
What the heck is that thing?

2252
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:21,620
Uh oh.

2253
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,920
I'm going into their house.

2254
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,440
I got a stink horn.

2255
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,580
I'm going in!

2256
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,600
Put your bow and arrow...

2257
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:37,720
Oh!

2258
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,420
I can do that!

2259
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,800
I can put bow and arrow with shortcuts?

2260
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,360
That's kinda huge.

2261
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,300
Wait.

2262
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,640
I didn't even think about that.

2263
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:47,940
Uh...

2264
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:48,660
Oh!

2265
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,400
Oops.

2266
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,100
I was gonna press...

2267
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:52,840
I was gonna do four.

2268
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:55,740
Uh...

2269
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:55,940
Wait.

2270
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,260
Okay.

2271
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:57,800
Let's redo.

2272
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,720
That's two.

2273
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:00,140
Okay.

2274
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:00,560
Three.

2275
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,000
Okay.

2276
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:01,480
We'll do...

2277
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,700
From three on is our magic.

2278
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:03,500
So we got that.

2279
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,060
And then we got...

2280
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,600
Four.

2281
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,460
We'll do...

2282
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,800
And then...

2283
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,720
Actually four is our fire.

2284
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,680
And five is our fire.

2285
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,440
I'm ready.

2286
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,800
Finger on the key.

2287
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:29,920
Ready to fire?

2288
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:30,560
Oh.

2289
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,520
Okay.

2290
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,160
Some cloth.

2291
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,680
Cheese wheel.

2292
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,180
Uh...

2293
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:50,660
All of it.

2294
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:51,120
Thanks.

2295
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,660
I'm encumbered.

2296
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,640
The goblin ahead is not as...

2297
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,260
You can sneak by pressing left control.

2298
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,060
Wait.

2299
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,180
But I'm over encumbered.

2300
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,180
Cheese is heavy.

2301
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:04,940
Oh.

2302
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,260
I gotta get rid of the cheese.

2303
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:09,740
Oh.

2304
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,180
I wish I...

2305
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,220
I can't put it back.

2306
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:13,780
Oh.

2307
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,240
Eat it.

2308
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:16,940
Just eat it.

2309
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:17,280
Okay.

2310
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,580
Where is...

2311
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:18,720
Oh.

2312
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,300
My cheese.

2313
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,220
Oh my god.

2314
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:27,380
I'm full of cheese.

2315
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,540
The closed eye indicates you are undetected.

2316
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:32,700
Wait.

2317
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,560
I don't see a closed eye.

2318
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,200
There's no closed eye.

2319
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:37,340
Huh.

2320
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,800
Is it the middle?

2321
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,320
The middle.

2322
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,340
When a fight begins, I will flicker.

2323
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,460
Oh, so it's the...

2324
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,500
Like the crosshair?

2325
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:48,940
Okay.

2326
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,200
If I shoot a fireball at him...

2327
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:01,410
Where'd he go?

2328
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,580
Fireball is not sneaky.

2329
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,520
Yeah, but I would...

2330
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,440
I could do it.

2331
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,000
Where'd he go?

2332
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,630
Where'd he go?

2333
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,940
He's got...

2334
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,360
A dinosaur?

2335
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,440
Oh.

2336
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,140
Never mind.

2337
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,380
He's roasting a rat.

2338
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,820
What if

2339
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,680
he was nice?

2340
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:49,800
Nice.

2341
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,320
Dang.

2342
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,520
He probably wasn't though.

2343
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,280
He was probably really, really mean.

2344
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,240
Poison of illness.

2345
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,880
Novice mortar and pestle.

2346
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,040
What the hell is that?

2347
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,680
Go in your inventory and find it.

2348
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,080
Activate it to create potions!

2349
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:15,420
Oh!

2350
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,820
I need a break.

2351
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,280
This is my place now.

2352
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,740
Oh, man.

2353
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:28,440
Gosh.

2354
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,860
It ain't easy taking over goblin homes and...

2355
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:32,440
Wake it up.

2356
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:32,980
E.T.

2357
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:33,340
get up.

2358
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:33,940
Tina!

2359
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:34,660
Tina!

2360
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,080
Tina, get up.

2361
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:35,700
Tina!

2362
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:36,740
Tina, get up.

2363
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:37,740
Tina!

2364
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,140
Tina, get up.

2365
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:39,340
Tina!

2366
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:46,220
Tina, get up.

2367
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,800
I didn't want that.

2368
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,020
Hungry.

2369
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,480
Where's my rat?

2370
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,600
Oh, I have so much rat.

2371
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,840
Wait, shouldn't this not be cooked rat meat?

2372
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,700
So I can just eat raw rat?

2373
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:01,030
What the?

2374
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:06,590
Wait, how did... Wait, I messed it up.

2375
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:16,060
Whatever.

2376
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,200
Easy.

2377
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,060
Easy.

2378
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:27,300
What did I make my... I think it was...

2379
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,800
Okay, my bow and arrow is one.

2380
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,240
And my katana is two.

2381
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:31,580
Okay.

2382
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,780
Let's sneak.

2383
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,640
Let's sneak.

2384
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:42,020
There's probably other goblins around here.

2385
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:02,000
Oh!

2386
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,500
How?

2387
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:09,320
How the hell?

2388
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,540
Oh.

2389
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,440
Oh, good thing I didn't run.

2390
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,740
Oh, I thought it said goblin stinker.

2391
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,420
I'm over encumbered.

2392
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,040
Oh my gosh, I'm so weak.

2393
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,080
I should have become a...

2394
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:27,700
E.T.

2395
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,740
Why are you so small?

2396
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,620
Goblin stinker.

2397
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,860
Oh, bear pelt is heavy.

2398
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,500
But look how much gold we get from it.

2399
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:37,660
Hmm.

2400
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,980
Time to eat some meat.

2401
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:43,970
There we go.

2402
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,010
Easy peasy.

2403
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,430
Oh!

2404
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,050
You...

2405
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:53,330
You tried.

2406
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,890
Wait, but this is only one.

2407
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,910
Why is there whispers?

2408
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,290
Who's whispering?

2409
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:07,990
Making potions?

2410
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:08,950
Oh yeah, how do I...

2411
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:09,290
Let's see.

2412
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:11,770
It's in here?

2413
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,270
This thing?

2414
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:15,210
Oh!

2415
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:17,510
Oh, tutorial.

2416
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:18,250
Okay.

2417
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:18,990
Oh my gosh.

2418
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:21,950
Combine ingredients with similar effects to create potions and poisons.

2419
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:24,650
Your alchemy skill will make your creations more powerful.

2420
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:27,470
The more potions you create, the higher your alchemy skill will increase.

2421
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:32,110
Use additional apparatuses to improve the strength of the potions you create.

2422
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,170
So if I'm like full...

2423
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:34,590
Oh, okay.

2424
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:36,050
Lettuce...

2425
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:38,330
Tomato...

2426
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,490
That...

2427
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,430
That...

2428
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,590
How does it create...

2429
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:41,850
I...

2430
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:44,770
Okay.

2431
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:49,270
I made something.

2432
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:52,110
This doesn't make anything.

2433
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,590
Weirdest BLT ever?

2434
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:56,410
Yeah, exactly.

2435
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:58,430
What do you mean weird?

2436
01:37:58,570 --> 01:37:59,390
It's probably delicious.

2437
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:04,870
Bones.

2438
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:07,430
Ah, no bones about it.

2439
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:08,430
Alright, let's keep going.

2440
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:14,150
Oh, that's a lot of fire.

2441
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,840
What is that?

2442
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,100
Anybody around?

2443
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,660
Oh, dead rat.

2444
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,500
Rat sandwich.

2445
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,320
Okay, there you go.

2446
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,260
I kind of want my sword.

2447
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,180
Okay.

2448
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:37,760
I'm sneaky.

2449
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,340
I'm so sneaky.

2450
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:42,580
I'm sneaky.

2451
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,520
I'm also...

2452
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,000
Stealing?

2453
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:49,420
Wait.

2454
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,220
Wait, go back.

2455
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,140
What was the...

2456
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,220
Oh, there we go.

2457
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,000
Easy.

2458
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,600
Default FOV is pretty low if you ever feel motion sick.

2459
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,280
Oh, thank you.

2460
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,440
Do you guys think it's okay?

2461
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,760
I'm over encumbered.

2462
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:06,860
Arrows.

2463
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:14,210
That's okay.

2464
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:16,630
Might be time to get rid of our iron.

2465
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,810
Our armor, I mean.

2466
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:24,190
This is fine.

2467
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:30,590
We can get rid of those.

2468
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:30,830
Okay.

2469
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,600
Do you need two bows?

2470
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,240
What if one breaks?

2471
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:37,720
Yikes.

2472
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,900
Look, it's already at 91.

2473
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,200
Don't I need another bow?

2474
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:57,580
What's that?

2475
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,020
Oh, it's a guy.

2476
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,320
I could shoot him.

2477
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,250
Oops.

2478
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:08,510
He didn't notice that.

2479
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:14,600
Oh, my God.

2480
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,300
He also has arrows.

2481
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,900
But I got his ass first.

2482
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,240
Oh.

2483
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:22,580
Yeah.

2484
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,340
Take some apples.

2485
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,560
Push the logs.

2486
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,420
Wait, you can do that?

2487
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,080
Oh, there was another guy.

2488
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:40,040
He didn't even notice his first friend, though.

2489
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,400
There was a second guy.

2490
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:41,520
Why?

2491
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,020
The goblins are stupid.

2492
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,640
Can I get burnt on this?

2493
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,380
That's some rat meat.

2494
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,760
Anything else in here?

2495
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:01,640
No?

2496
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:02,620
Okay.

2497
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,920
He was oblivious.

2498
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:14,070
Did you guys hear that?

2499
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:17,090
Lockpick.

2500
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,450
Of course I'll take.

2501
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:20,290
What do you got?

2502
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:22,350
What do you got?

2503
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:24,290
I don't need your short sword.

2504
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,940
Oh, my God.

2505
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,260
I'm going to be going into their whole ass village.

2506
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,240
Oh, my God.

2507
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,400
Wait.

2508
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:41,960
No, no, no.

2509
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:42,520
I...

2510
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:42,600
Okay.

2511
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:45,980
Take.

2512
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:49,540
Goblin slayer time.

2513
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,040
Take.

2514
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,040
Who else is in here?

2515
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,220
I heard you.

2516
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:01,850
Wait, what?

2517
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:03,870
What is the footsteps that are counting down?

2518
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:05,870
Above me.

2519
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:09,370
Goblins don't have pockets on their loincloths.

2520
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,530
Where are you reaching?

2521
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,310
Oh, your objective marker.

2522
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:15,910
Oh, okay.

2523
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,150
Okay.

2524
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,420
Oh, shoot.

2525
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:33,810
Goblin berserker.

2526
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:37,790
Thank you.

2527
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,450
It does have a shield.

2528
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,810
I think I have a shield too, though.

2529
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,120
Rough leather shield.

2530
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,140
I think his is...

2531
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,020
Not as good as mine.

2532
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,750
Anybody that can sneak attack you?

2533
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:00,950
Yes, indeedy.

2534
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,360
Oh, my God.

2535
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:09,620
Wait.

2536
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,460
You can run this way.

2537
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:10,940
Ah!

2538
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:16,020
Oops.

2539
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:18,460
I thought...

2540
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,440
I thought there was a...

2541
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:24,000
I thought it was a...

2542
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,300
I thought it was like a...

2543
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,760
Like a little cliff.

2544
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:29,260
You know?

2545
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,300
You had to run around.

2546
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,200
Golly.

2547
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,420
Yeah, like a little chasm.

2548
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:36,880
Exactly.

2549
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:38,620
What is the eye?

2550
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:40,060
Why is the eye, though?

2551
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,540
Is open.

2552
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:42,700
Who sees me?

2553
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,720
Or who's around, rather?

2554
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,480
That guy over there!

2555
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,620
Whoa.

2556
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:01,310
What the?

2557
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:02,450
I

2558
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:09,840
don't know what it's up.

2559
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,980
They can also hear you.

2560
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,460
They can?

2561
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:26,100
I'm trying to see where I... Oh, here, there's a rat.

2562
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:34,480
Oh, can I not go through the... the fence?

2563
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:36,640
Oh.

2564
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:45,900
There's two of them.

2565
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,180
Sneak.

2566
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:50,420
Sneak.

2567
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,680
Alright, very good.

2568
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,660
Goblin Slayer would be proud.

2569
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:02,300
I am that Goblin Slayer.

2570
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,420
I saw a guy over there, though.

2571
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,320
I saw, I saw.

2572
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:12,320
I'm still... crouched.

2573
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,200
I'm still sneaking around.

2574
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,460
That guy's huge!

2575
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,400
There's one more rat.

2576
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,260
Oops.

2577
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,740
The drop off on this is... Yoik.

2578
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:30,400
Okay.

2579
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,100
Yoiks.

2580
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,380
Alright.

2581
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:34,760
Alright.

2582
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,260
I think I can take him.

2583
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,900
I think I can take him.

2584
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:47,500
Oh, no.

2585
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,020
My fatigue.

2586
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:57,710
We're fine.

2587
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:01,190
Oh, they're tough.

2588
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,070
I'm tougher.

2589
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,530
I'm the toughest there ever was.

2590
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:06,290
I'm the toughest there ever is.

2591
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:10,590
I'm the... I'm the... I'm the brains here.

2592
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:12,210
And the brawn.

2593
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:15,830
I'm the toughest there ever be.

2594
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:18,070
Take your drinks.

2595
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:18,970
Take your ale.

2596
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:20,010
Take your chests.

2597
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:21,210
Oh.

2598
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:23,590
Repair hammer.

2599
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:24,330
What's that?

2600
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:28,410
You found a repair hammer.

2601
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:30,130
In order to repair your weapons and armor...

2602
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:30,970
Oh.

2603
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:33,150
Good, good, good.

2604
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:36,430
Let's see.

2605
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:38,250
What other things you got around here?

2606
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:41,230
Let's go over here.

2607
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,270
The powers go into her head.

2608
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,290
I'm...

2609
01:46:48,290 --> 01:46:50,970
I'm the greatest to ever do it!

2610
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:54,630
Of course I can be cocky.

2611
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:57,730
That looks...

2612
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:58,450
Fancy!

2613
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:05,650
Whoa!

2614
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,050
Flawed sapphire.

2615
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:11,190
Gold nugget!

2616
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:15,470
Yippee!

2617
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:24,810
Your decorations are...

2618
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,050
Actually quite nice.

2619
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:28,430
What do you got?

2620
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:29,470
Ooh.

2621
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,150
I'll take your arrows...

2622
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:34,790
And your petty soul gem.

2623
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:36,370
And I'm...

2624
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:36,930
His staff?

2625
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:37,710
I can take that!

2626
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:39,690
Whoa!

2627
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:42,130
Wait.

2628
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:43,050
What is this?

2629
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,170
Can I use this?

2630
01:47:47,710 --> 01:47:48,830
Oh my god!

2631
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,460
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2632
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,100
You guys see his mouth?

2633
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,060
E.T.

2634
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,620
Phone home.

2635
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:06,040
Oh, what's that?

2636
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,500
Let's go back to my...

2637
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,580
Let's go back to my sword.

2638
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,920
Yeah, you guys are kind of in the way.

2639
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:12,640
It's okay, though.

2640
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,000
I'm sneaking.

2641
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:17,960
I'm sneaking again.

2642
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,980
Oh, uh, F5.

2643
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,360
Thank you, whoever taught me F5.

2644
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:27,980
Quick save.

2645
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:32,930
Are we out?

2646
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:33,850
Is this it?

2647
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:35,590
Wait a second!

2648
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,550
Wait a second!

2649
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:45,550
You're welcome.

2650
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,050
Yeah!

2651
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:49,390
F9 is quick load as well.

2652
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:49,750
Oh.

2653
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:50,970
Why aren't they next to...

2654
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,510
I guess...

2655
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:54,430
I guess maybe actually it's better that they're not next to each other, huh?

2656
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:58,050
So, I'm still confused about the zombie.

2657
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,550
Why it exists.

2658
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:06,390
Oh my gosh, it's so dark in here.

2659
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:10,130
Yeah, misload.

2660
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:15,110
You should find a defensible spot and protect the emperor.

2661
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,730
Oh.

2662
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:16,830
Just kidding, they're talking.

2663
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:26,760
Oh.

2664
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,280
I'll go help.

2665
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,340
Maybe.

2666
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,320
Who's the baddies?

2667
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:32,700
Hi!

2668
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,060
Hello!

2669
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

2670
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,060
I...

2671
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,800
Sire, we have to go now.

2672
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:42,360
Not yet.

2673
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,980
Let me rest a moment longer.

2674
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:46,640
I'll talk to him.

2675
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:47,220
Hello!

2676
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,720
Dammit, it's that prisoner again!

2677
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:49,440
Kill her!

2678
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:51,540
She might be working with the assassins.

2679
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:51,720
I'm not!

2680
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,420
No, she is not one of them.

2681
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:55,140
Thank you.

2682
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,300
She can help us.

2683
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,140
She must help us.

2684
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:59,040
Yeah, I'll help you.

2685
01:49:59,120 --> 01:49:59,280
Oh!

2686
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,760
They cannot understand why I trust you.

2687
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,300
They've not seen what I've seen.

2688
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,200
Your dreams.

2689
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:05,900
How can I explain?

2690
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,060
Listen.

2691
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,780
You know the nine.

2692
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,920
How they guide our fates with an invisible hand.

2693
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:14,660
Uh...

2694
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:16,120
The nine...

2695
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,120
The nine guide...

2696
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,720
Uh...

2697
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,600
I don't know.

2698
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,720
The who?

2699
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,980
I don't even know this.

2700
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,280
What is...

2701
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:27,700
What do you...

2702
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,280
The nine guide and protect...

2703
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,940
I've observed the nine all my days.

2704
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,940
And I chart my course...

2705
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:34,200
...by the cycles of the heavens.

2706
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,320
The skies are marked with numberless sparks.

2707
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,840
Each a fire.

2708
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:39,520
The guy behind here is frozen.

2709
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,000
And every one a sign.

2710
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,020
I know these stars well.

2711
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,420
And I wonder...

2712
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,760
Which sign marked your birth?

2713
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,100
Oh!

2714
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,280
Chula's my birth sign!

2715
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:52,560
Okay.

2716
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,420
The serpent!

2717
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,480
What is a steel?

2718
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:57,980
Oh!

2719
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:58,520
This is...

2720
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,180
It gives us like...

2721
01:50:59,180 --> 01:50:59,680
More...

2722
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,260
Buffs.

2723
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:02,640
We are the warrior.

2724
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:04,380
Fortify endurance.

2725
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,340
That's...

2726
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:05,980
I like that.

2727
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,740
Fortify strength.

2728
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,680
I like that too.

2729
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,300
Mage.

2730
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,760
Agility, luck, and speed.

2731
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,700
I like that.

2732
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,960
There's a lady.

2733
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,500
Oh!

2734
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:19,420
Oh my gosh!

2735
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:19,960
It's lady!

2736
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,920
Fortify willpower...

2737
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,540
And endurance.

2738
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,340
The lover.

2739
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,400
Lover's kiss.

2740
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,580
It paralyzes the target for 10 seconds.

2741
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:30,980
Wait.

2742
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,060
Wait.

2743
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,900
What's the serpent do?

2744
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,040
Serpent spell.

2745
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,180
Deal three points of damage for 20 seconds.

2746
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:58,100
It also cures poison, dispels 90 points, and damage fatigue 100 points to the caster.

2747
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,700
Oh, okay.

2748
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:01,580
Wait.

2749
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:01,900
Wait.

2750
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:02,000
What?

2751
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:02,580
To me?

2752
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,820
That sucks!

2753
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,460
Wait.

2754
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:13,230
Like...

2755
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:15,970
I take 100 point...

2756
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:19,250
I take 100 point fatigue damage, and...

2757
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:21,050
Also...

2758
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:21,690
Also...

2759
01:52:21,690 --> 01:52:22,460
90 point...

2760
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,230
90 point...

2761
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:24,250
Oh.

2762
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:27,030
It just uses stamina.

2763
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:31,390
It's bad.

2764
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:32,810
What's this guy?

2765
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:33,350
The lord?

2766
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:34,390
Shield?

2767
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:35,910
Resist magic.

2768
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:38,450
If you...

2769
01:52:38,450 --> 01:52:41,650
Pick the lover, you have to go two every time you use the ability.

2770
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,250
Yeah, but like...

2771
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:45,970
Would I remember to use it?

2772
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:48,710
Oh my gosh, it's Regirock!

2773
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:51,650
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

2774
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:58,650
Fortify Magicka, spell absorption, Stunt and Magicka.

2775
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,700
Opens locks of average difficulty.

2776
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:08,380
Can be used once per day.

2777
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:09,920
Oh.

2778
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:11,920
Um, the ritual.

2779
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,540
The shadow.

2780
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,200
Grants invisibility for 60 seconds.

2781
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:18,900
The apprentice.

2782
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:21,420
The apprentice.

2783
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:23,840
Mmm.

2784
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:30,060
The lord is super good if you don't care about casting magic.

2785
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,440
So far, I actually...

2786
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,600
I've thought about that one because I...

2787
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:38,580
Don't really care about casting magic.

2788
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,420
Everything once per day is kind of meh.

2789
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,000
Right, that's why I was like looking at something maybe like...

2790
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,440
Oh, this one.

2791
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,640
I was thinking either the warrior, the thief, the lord.

2792
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,840
Not the apprentice.

2793
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:00,900
Weakness to magic.

2794
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,560
By a hundred percent?

2795
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,960
Holy cow.

2796
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,400
Luck boosts every skill in this game?

2797
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,080
Oh!

2798
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:11,120
Really?

2799
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,820
Wait, what was the shadow?

2800
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:13,940
Oh, the invisibility.

2801
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:16,160
Wait, that's kind of huge, no?

2802
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,060
You can change star signs really easily.

2803
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:19,740
Oh, you can?

2804
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:28,060
It's good.

2805
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:29,080
Thief is good.

2806
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,320
Let's try a thief.

2807
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,020
I'm a thief.

2808
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,520
Yes.

2809
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,900
The signs I read show the end of my path.

2810
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,800
My death, a necessary end.

2811
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:41,400
He's flickering.

2812
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,700
Will come when it will come.

2813
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:43,620
You're okay, buddy.

2814
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:44,720
What about me?

2815
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,260
I'm so selfish.

2816
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:49,580
Oh, you're gonna die, but what about me, huh?

2817
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:52,120
You can't change star signs in Oblivion.

2818
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,880
Oh, I got one guide.

2819
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,800
Well, at least we picked...

2820
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,420
A good one, I guess.

2821
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,820
At least we picked a decent one.

2822
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:07,960
So, it's okay.

2823
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:09,160
I don't mind.

2824
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,600
Your stars are not mine.

2825
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:15,880
Today, the thief shall guide your steps on the road to destiny.

2826
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,340
Yes.

2827
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:19,360
Hmm, can you see my fate?

2828
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,320
My dreams grant me no opinions of success.

2829
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:29,640
Their compass ventures not beyond the doors of death, but in your face, I behold the sun's companion.

2830
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:34,380
The dawn of Akatosh's bright glory may banish the coming darkness.

2831
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:35,180
One chance to...

2832
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:37,060
One last chance to add a character I end up to a door.

2833
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:40,580
And with the promise of your aid, my heart must be satisfied.

2834
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,540
Aren't you afraid to die?

2835
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:45,860
No trophies of my triumphs precede me.

2836
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:50,540
But I have lived well, and my ghost shall rest easy.

2837
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,800
Men are but flesh and blood.

2838
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:56,360
They know their doom, but not the hour.

2839
01:55:57,020 --> 01:56:00,960
In this, I am blessed to see the hour of my death.

2840
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:03,400
To face my apportioned fate.

2841
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:05,120
Then fall.

2842
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:05,940
Okay.

2843
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:07,440
Where are we going?

2844
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:13,160
I won't spoil, but there's peak voice acting.

2845
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:13,920
Like the...

2846
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,700
I love that lady.

2847
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:18,380
She's like, oh no.

2848
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:20,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2849
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,740
I go to my grave.

2850
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:25,020
A tongue shriller than all the music calls me.

2851
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:25,640
Where are we going?

2852
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,500
You shall follow me yet for a while.

2853
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:29,440
Then we must part.

2854
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,100
Okay.

2855
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:31,640
What if I kill you first?

2856
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:33,820
Oh, my god.

2857
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:35,100
Okay.

2858
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,440
The blades.

2859
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,260
We're the emperor's bodyguards.

2860
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,480
Our job is to get him out of situations like this.

2861
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,600
Although I admit, things are not going according to plan.

2862
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:47,620
End him now.

2863
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:53,100
My job is to make sure the emperor gets out of here alive, and I intend to do it.

2864
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:53,560
Okay.

2865
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:59,080
Stick close and let us do our job, and you'll be all right.

2866
01:56:59,240 --> 01:56:59,520
Okay.

2867
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:04,260
Do I need to have the torch, or...

2868
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,900
Did you guys loot this place already?

2869
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,400
I guess...

2870
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:11,700
I guess I'll follow them.

2871
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:13,600
No.

2872
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:19,250
A little dip?

2873
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:20,610
No?

2874
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,090
Okay.

2875
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:24,290
Not much fun.

2876
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,250
This one's mine!

2877
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:25,550
Oh.

2878
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:27,190
Why are there bugs on my strings?

2879
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:27,650
Prisoner, help!

2880
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:32,370
I thought mud crabs were fearsome.

2881
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:32,650
Ah!

2882
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:33,230
Ah!

2883
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:35,390
Oh, my god.

2884
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:36,410
That guy's on fire!

2885
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:38,630
Everything good?

2886
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:40,590
This one's mine.

2887
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:42,290
Take their...

2888
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,610
Take everything that they have.

2889
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:44,850
Nothing.

2890
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:46,610
Just their clothes.

2891
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:48,790
Oblivion!

2892
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:50,070
Protect the emperor!

2893
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:51,030
Protect the emperor!

2894
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:52,510
Yeah!

2895
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:55,370
Let's go down.

2896
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:59,110
Watch your backwards.

2897
01:57:59,130 --> 01:57:59,750
That's the matter.

2898
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:02,490
They don't need me.

2899
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:04,410
They don't need me.

2900
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:05,790
Undress them.

2901
01:58:09,070 --> 01:58:11,050
Why are there so many guys down here?

2902
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:11,450
Anyway.

2903
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,650
The faceplate.

2904
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,200
What if I went?

2905
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:35,900
Everything's fine.

2906
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,320
I could have told you.

2907
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:40,940
I don't know, though.

2908
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,180
I don't know about that.

2909
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,740
This is gonna open up.

2910
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:46,080
I don't know.

2911
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:47,900
There's a door over there, too!

2912
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,920
This is about to be an ambush.

2913
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,560
Wait, you guys are going that way.

2914
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:53,360
Wait, what's over here, then?

2915
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,460
A trap!

2916
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:05,340
What's it worth a try?

2917
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:06,200
In there?

2918
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,200
It's a dead end!

2919
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,400
Oh, okay!

2920
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:22,630
There's no good options here.

2921
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:23,610
What, just open?

2922
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:24,370
They're behind us.

2923
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:25,610
Wait here, sire.

2924
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:26,610
Oh my god!

2925
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,850
Wait here with the emperor.

2926
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,390
Guard him with your life.

2927
01:59:29,610 --> 01:59:29,910
Oh, me?

2928
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:31,870
For the emperor!

2929
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:35,550
Let's get...

2930
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:36,790
They're just standing there.

2931
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:43,290
I told you to stay with the emperor.

2932
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:44,150
Oh, okay.

2933
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,510
Sorry.

2934
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:45,750
Let's get...

2935
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,250
Okay, bye-bye.

2936
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,730
I'll save it with the emperor.

2937
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:52,330
Oblivion take you!

2938
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:54,490
Yeah!

2939
01:59:58,490 --> 01:59:59,030
I...

2940
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,970
There's nobody here!

2941
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:00,810
Okay.

2942
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:01,790
Oblivion take you.

2943
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:02,970
I can go no further.

2944
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:07,610
You alone must stand against the prince of destruction and his mortal servants.

2945
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:10,390
He must not have the amulet of kings.

2946
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:11,250
Okay.

2947
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:12,190
Take the amulet.

2948
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:13,450
Give it to Joffrey.

2949
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:13,810
Joffrey.

2950
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:16,330
He alone knows where to find my last son.

2951
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:17,070
I don't know.

2952
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,450
Who's Joffrey?

2953
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:22,930
Are you about to die?

2954
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:23,330
Oh.

2955
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:24,270
Oh my god.

2956
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,210
Wait, I can't move!

2957
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:25,690
Ah!

2958
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:27,470
Stranger.

2959
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:31,830
You chose a bad day to take up the coals of the...

2960
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:32,270
Ah!

2961
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,630
I couldn't move!

2962
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,290
My sword for the dragon!

2963
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:38,450
No.

2964
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:40,410
Talos save us.

2965
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:41,610
Oh, no.

2966
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:42,970
It wasn't me.

2967
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,330
We failed.

2968
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,670
I failed.

2969
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:46,130
Are you gonna...

2970
02:00:46,130 --> 02:00:46,890
Are you gonna kill yourself?

2971
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:48,850
Blades are sworn to protect the emperor.

2972
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:51,670
Now he and all his heirs are dead.

2973
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:52,910
The amulet.

2974
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:54,130
Where's the amulet of kings?

2975
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:55,530
It wasn't on the emperor's body.

2976
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,590
Do I have it?

2977
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:57,570
The emperor gave it to me.

2978
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:58,170
Strange.

2979
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:00,290
He saw something in you.

2980
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:01,370
Trusted you.

2981
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:05,530
They say it's the dragon blood that flows through the veins of every septum.

2982
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:07,810
They see more than less of them.

2983
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:07,970
I think people...

2984
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,290
I think he thinks I'm calming.

2985
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:11,070
The amulet of kings is a sacred symbol of the empire.

2986
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:12,350
I bring a wave of nostalgia to him.

2987
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:14,210
Most people think of the red dragon crown.

2988
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:14,370
Like an old movie.

2989
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:15,410
But that's just jewelry.

2990
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,870
The amulet has power.

2991
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,890
Only a true heir of the blood can wear it, they say.

2992
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:21,670
What if I am?

2993
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:23,210
He must have given it to you for a reason.

2994
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:24,370
Did he say why?

2995
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:26,330
I'm not gonna tell you.

2996
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:28,890
What if you are the one sending in all these guys in?

2997
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:29,670
What if you...

2998
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:31,050
I must take it to Joffrey.

2999
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:31,930
Joffrey?

3000
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:33,030
He said that?

3001
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:33,450
Why?

3002
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:34,210
Why?

3003
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:36,290
There is another heir.

3004
02:01:36,290 --> 02:01:38,010
Nothing I ever heard about.

3005
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:40,030
But Joffrey would be the one to know.

3006
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,290
He's the Grand Master of my order.

3007
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:44,990
Although you may not think so to meet him.

3008
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:48,150
He lives quietly as a monk at Waynon Priory.

3009
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:49,850
Near the city of Coral.

3010
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:50,590
Coral.

3011
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:51,890
Coral.

3012
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:52,910
How do I get there?

3013
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,050
First, you need to get out of here.

3014
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:57,910
Through that door must be the entrance to the sewers.

3015
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:58,850
Past the locked gate.

3016
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:00,170
That's where we were heading.

3017
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:00,710
Okay.

3018
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:02,790
It's a secret way out of the imperial city.

3019
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:04,590
Or it was supposed to be secret.

3020
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:05,050
Yeah.

3021
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:07,770
Here, you'll need this key for the last door into the sewers.

3022
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:08,410
Oh, thank you.

3023
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:09,630
The sewers?

3024
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:11,830
There are rats and goblins down there.

3025
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:12,390
Ah, more!

3026
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:15,550
But from what I've seen of you, I'm guessing you're an experienced pilgrim.

3027
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:16,450
Am I right?

3028
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:18,890
I'm more of an alien.

3029
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:23,610
Well, you must now choose your class.

3030
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:29,730
The major skills of your class will start higher than your other skills and will be easier to increase.

3031
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:30,990
Oh my god!

3032
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:32,910
Oh!

3033
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:33,270
Oh!

3034
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:34,370
I could be a pilgrim!

3035
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:40,690
Select a class or create a custom class.

3036
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:43,030
What's a custom class?

3037
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:45,490
Oh!

3038
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:46,610
Interesting.

3039
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:49,790
Custom.

3040
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:54,550
Custom is good.

3041
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:57,090
We are Japanese goblins.

3042
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:57,190
We are Japanese goblins.

3043
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:59,510
You can even name it?

3044
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:00,310
Wait.

3045
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:06,150
Maybe stealth is good.

3046
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:08,490
I like being stealthy.

3047
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,350
Attributes.

3048
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:12,830
What?

3049
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:14,290
My personal...

3050
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,010
Oh my god!

3051
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:15,910
Nobody...

3052
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:17,970
Only my mother would love me with that face!

3053
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:19,530
Wow!

3054
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:37,180
Bare hands.

3055
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:38,860
How much you can carry.

3056
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,440
I do...

3057
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,500
I do think that's pretty good for me.

3058
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:43,740
Willpower.

3059
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,060
How much you regenerate.

3060
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:45,920
Magical.

3061
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:48,700
Greatly increases your maximum fatigue.

3062
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:49,800
Hmm?

3063
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:51,890
Hmm?

3064
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:52,650
Hmm?

3065
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,330
The agility...

3066
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:54,930
I feel...

3067
02:03:54,930 --> 02:03:55,770
Oh!

3068
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:57,730
Slightly increases your maximum fatigue.

3069
02:03:58,290 --> 02:03:58,670
Oh!

3070
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:01,030
The amount you deal with bows!

3071
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:01,730
That's me!

3072
02:04:02,110 --> 02:04:02,670
Oh my gosh!

3073
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,850
Look at the little snakey too!

3074
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:06,330
Bows!

3075
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:09,710
How fast you move.

3076
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:11,670
Increases your maximum health.

3077
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:14,290
Defines how quickly you regenerate health.

3078
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:17,470
You need some personality.

3079
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:18,390
Aye!

3080
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:21,570
Custom otage class.

3081
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:24,670
Fix all of your skills.

3082
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:25,370
Oh yes!

3083
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:25,810
Yeah!

3084
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:28,490
So...

3085
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:30,450
Hmm...

3086
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:31,910
Stealth archer, baby.

3087
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:32,870
Oh my god.

3088
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,350
ET.

3089
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:36,050
Luck is solid.

3090
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:37,770
If it does everything!

3091
02:04:38,570 --> 02:04:39,670
I mean...

3092
02:04:39,670 --> 02:04:40,410
That's pretty good, no?

3093
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:42,830
Hmm...

3094
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:44,510
Fix how much people like you.

3095
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:46,750
I kinda wanna...

3096
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:48,490
ET has a good personality.

3097
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:52,410
ET is like...

3098
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:56,350
Luck is a bait, not luck.

3099
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:57,010
Luck is bad.

3100
02:04:57,170 --> 02:04:57,630
Oh, okay.

3101
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:58,690
Okay, okay.

3102
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:02,780
Ugh!

3103
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:06,360
I think ET should have a good personality.

3104
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,840
Such a likable fellow.

3105
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:17,620
Personality for the winning smile.

3106
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:19,100
They are lying.

3107
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,640
Well...

3108
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:21,000
I...

3109
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:22,700
I wasn't gonna pick luck anyway.

3110
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:23,420
So...

3111
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:23,720
It's fine.

3112
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:27,040
Because I picked a...

3113
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,560
Wait, did I pick it earlier?

3114
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:30,040
I did the thief one.

3115
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,980
I don't remember if that had luck on it.

3116
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,280
Great personality.

3117
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:43,020
No one needs personality.

3118
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:43,360
No one needs personality.

3119
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,980
Hehehehe.

3120
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:53,340
Um...

3121
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,840
Greatly increases your max health.

3122
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:59,640
Snake has a likable personality.

3123
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,100
No, he does not.

3124
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,180
That guy is...

3125
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,660
That guy is a grump.

3126
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,540
Endurance for running and jumping?

3127
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,560
That doesn't even say though.

3128
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,020
If that's...

3129
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:13,320
Endurance does not...

3130
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:16,380
I feel like endurance would not not be like...

3131
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:19,600
I feel like endurance would affect my fatigue, no?

3132
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:20,840
But it doesn't.

3133
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:24,660
It's better to be lucky than to be skilled in all things.

3134
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,380
That's so true.

3135
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:28,080
Lucky people are the worst.

3136
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,940
I'm so jealous of lucky people.

3137
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:34,740
Endurance equals carry more weight.

3138
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,780
Wait, but why doesn't it say that then?

3139
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,300
Endurance...

3140
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,700
It just says endurance is HP.

3141
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:42,520
It does not say anything about...

3142
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:46,260
It doesn't say anything about...

3143
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:47,480
Um...

3144
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:49,200
How much you can carry or your fatigue.

3145
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,280
Strength... Yeah, strength is carry weight.

3146
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,180
He is lying.

3147
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:00,920
I'm not getting one guide.

3148
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,940
I'm correcting them.

3149
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:03,680
I don't...

3150
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:06,760
If I got one guide, I would follow what they said.

3151
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,460
But I...

3152
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,660
I'm correcting them.

3153
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:13,560
To finish the game, I recommend to look up some Oblivion memes.

3154
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,740
I've been watching some clips.

3155
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:17,680
I like the silly things that happen.

3156
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:18,360
I don't know.

3157
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:19,940
Why do I feel like the second...

3158
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,080
One is so difficult to choose?

3159
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,940
Honestly, I feel like...

3160
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:27,140
Well, I don't need the Magicka most likely.

3161
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,360
Uh...

3162
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,580
I kinda wanna just be able to...

3163
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,240
I don't know.

3164
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:39,660
Speed...

3165
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:40,640
We could go so fast.

3166
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:43,060
What weapon?

3167
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:46,000
I probably will mostly use the bow and arrow.

3168
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,260
So maybe having something with fatigue...

3169
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:51,740
Well, this increases our fatigue a little bit.

3170
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:53,800
So...

3171
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,060
Agility was a must.

3172
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:55,640
I feel.

3173
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:56,480
I feel.

3174
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,260
Hmm...

3175
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:02,080
Luck's biggest issue is it slows to improve by level ups.

3176
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:07,940
You can only do plus one luck per level, but 60 luck improves all skills by plus four.

3177
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,180
Oh, okay, okay.

3178
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,020
I get it.

3179
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:17,230
Hmm...

3180
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,430
Speed for backpedaling while shooting.

3181
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:21,010
That's good.

3182
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:21,970
That's a good point.

3183
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:23,010
That's a good point.

3184
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:25,850
That's a good point.

3185
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:32,550
Hmm...

3186
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:34,090
Agility plus willpower.

3187
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:36,730
That's what I was thinking because of the fatigue, huh?

3188
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:41,690
Hmm...

3189
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:43,490
I'm going with personality.

3190
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:47,470
E.T.

3191
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:49,070
E.T.

3192
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:50,410
is like the...

3193
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,550
Greatest guy!

3194
02:08:55,190 --> 02:08:55,790
Combat!

3195
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:56,650
Oh!

3196
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:58,070
Um...

3197
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:00,450
Uh...

3198
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:01,650
Athletics.

3199
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:02,590
Wow!

3200
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:03,890
Effects how quickly...

3201
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:06,630
Wait, these are major skills, so we can pick a couple, no?

3202
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:10,550
How quickly we can run, swim, and sprint?

3203
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:15,440
Hmm...

3204
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:15,940
Oh...

3205
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:17,380
Wait...

3206
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:26,010
You can pick seven.

3207
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:29,250
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3208
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,430
So...

3209
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:32,830
Oh!

3210
02:09:33,150 --> 02:09:33,410
I see!

3211
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:34,010
There's more!

3212
02:09:36,170 --> 02:09:36,690
Oh!

3213
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:39,430
Well, I still think athletics is good.

3214
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:41,590
Affects to jump higher and withstand falls.

3215
02:09:42,690 --> 02:09:45,170
Affects your ability to use light armor more effectively.

3216
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:46,050
Oh!

3217
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:47,630
Damage and deal with bows!

3218
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:51,150
Affects your ability to get better deals when buying or selling.

3219
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:53,850
Open locked doors and containers!

3220
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:54,910
Sneak!

3221
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:56,770
Move unseen and unheard.

3222
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:57,270
Oh!

3223
02:09:57,770 --> 02:09:57,910
Oh!

3224
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:00,170
Speechcraft.

3225
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:03,070
Affects your ability to persuade listeners to like and trust...

3226
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:04,530
I already got a good personality.

3227
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:09,410
I didn't even look at the magic.

3228
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:15,210
Oh...

3229
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:16,910
Blade.

3230
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:18,310
Blunt.

3231
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,670
Hand to hand.

3232
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:20,450
CQC.

3233
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,650
Heavy armor.

3234
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,100
Speechcraft for NPC fun?

3235
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:28,560
Oh!

3236
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:29,740
Okay, I like that.

3237
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:32,180
Light or heavy armor?

3238
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,940
Yeah, I was thinking about getting an armor one, but...

3239
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:41,000
Probably light armor would be best if I'm trying to keep things...

3240
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:45,480
I didn't get any...

3241
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:47,540
I'm not good with heavy stuff.

3242
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:48,320
You know what I mean?

3243
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,860
Light armor is for cowards?

3244
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:51,600
What do you mean?

3245
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,740
What do you mean cowards?

3246
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:01,620
What do you like the look of more?

3247
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:03,980
Probably...

3248
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:05,880
I actually don't have a preference.

3249
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,360
I like how I'm an elf, but I don't care about the magic.

3250
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:26,420
E.T.

3251
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:27,280
Wore a blanket.

3252
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,360
That's light armor.

3253
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:30,140
Good enough.

3254
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:31,380
You convinced me.

3255
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:32,660
You convinced me.

3256
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:34,220
No, and we'll do acrobatics.

3257
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,700
That's me.

3258
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:41,780
I am...

3259
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,460
I am...

3260
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,520
The E.T.T.

3261
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:47,980
floor.

3262
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:50,920
Didn't E.T.

3263
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:51,660
wield magic?

3264
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,320
It's not magic if he's...

3265
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,740
If he's an alien.

3266
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:57,960
That's just part of his...

3267
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:02,540
All he knew how to do was glow his finger.

3268
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,140
He didn't know how to do anything else.

3269
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:09,500
He's an alien.

3270
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:09,540
He was.

3271
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:09,740
He was.

3272
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:10,160
He was.

3273
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:11,580
We are...

3274
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:13,200
Katie...

3275
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:14,840
Oh...

3276
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,600
Perry.

3277
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:17,220
Wait, get it?

3278
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:18,380
Katy Perry.

3279
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,800
That's the class name.

3280
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:35,900
Yeah, I know.

3281
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,920
It's the Katy Perry, get it?

3282
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,260
You get it?

3283
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,020
You get it?

3284
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:53,650
Because we're alien and...

3285
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:55,590
Gosh, you guys...

3286
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:57,450
You guys don't understand my genius.

3287
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:01,810
You guys don't understand my genius.

3288
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:09,450
Sometimes I see comments from people that are like...

3289
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:10,950
Man, I...

3290
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:12,810
Why is Mint always laughing?

3291
02:13:12,810 --> 02:13:13,950
What is she laughing at?

3292
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:15,130
What does she find so funny?

3293
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:17,710
I just laugh a lot.

3294
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:23,710
I just laugh at everything.

3295
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:26,210
And also, I'm a nervous laugher.

3296
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:27,910
I'm an angry laugher.

3297
02:13:28,650 --> 02:13:30,090
I'm an awkward laugher.

3298
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:32,590
I'm a sad laugher.

3299
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:34,550
I just laugh at everything.

3300
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:38,630
I can't take anything seriously, maybe.

3301
02:13:41,710 --> 02:13:43,650
I'm not allowed to laugh in 2025.

3302
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:45,750
I'm just always laughing at whatever.

3303
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:47,670
Because it's always...

3304
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:51,990
I can always just see how any little tiny thing can be so funny.

3305
02:13:52,270 --> 02:13:53,430
Like the way this...

3306
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:55,650
Like the way this chameleon looks.

3307
02:13:56,630 --> 02:13:59,830
Or the way that these two guys are standing.

3308
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:08,400
You've been extra laughy today.

3309
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:10,120
Am I?

3310
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:11,980
I can't tell.

3311
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:13,460
Hmm.

3312
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:15,960
Okay.

3313
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:18,060
Um...

3314
02:14:23,230 --> 02:14:26,710
I was gonna do like E, T, E, but...

3315
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:27,070
That...

3316
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:29,010
We're not combat either.

3317
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:29,830
We're stealth.

3318
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:34,990
Don't take meds.

3319
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:35,750
Be happy.

3320
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,580
You and Doki just laugh at everything then.

3321
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:09,760
Yeah, pretty much.

3322
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,860
What's wrong with E, T?

3323
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:14,760
Sneaky T?

3324
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:23,500
Hmm.

3325
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:35,940
Hmm.

3326
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,120
Sneaky T?

3327
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:55,260
Sneaky T?

3328
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,520
Yeah!

3329
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:07,800
Create the Sneaky T class?

3330
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:08,300
Yes.

3331
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:11,240
I am Sneaky T.

3332
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:18,420
Yeah.

3333
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:20,720
I wasn't far off.

3334
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:23,860
In any case, rats and goblins won't give you any trouble.

3335
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:24,320
It's neat.

3336
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:26,720
Up to the sewers, then what?

3337
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:28,800
You must get the amulet to Joffrey.

3338
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,900
Who the hell is Joffrey?

3339
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:33,260
Take no chances, but proceed to Wayne in Priory immediately.

3340
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:33,980
Got it?

3341
02:16:34,220 --> 02:16:34,680
Got it.

3342
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:36,280
I understand.

3343
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,560
No, please explain more.

3344
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:39,380
Take it easy.

3345
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:40,440
You'll be fine.

3346
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:43,260
I know this is a lot to take in all at once.

3347
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:44,040
Yeah, you think?

3348
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:49,100
No one's more surprised than me that I'm sending an escaped prisoner off with the amulet of kings.

3349
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:49,920
What do you mean escaped?

3350
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:50,700
You let me out!

3351
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:52,360
But the emperor trusted you for a reason.

3352
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,200
And I trust the emperor.

3353
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:58,700
The amulet of kings must get to Joffrey at Wayne in Priory.

3354
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:00,620
Sneety phone hole.

3355
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:04,240
Joffrey should know how to find the heir the emperor spoke of.

3356
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:09,260
The amulet must reach Emperor Uriel's heir, so a new emperor can be crowned.

3357
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:09,960
Okay.

3358
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:11,460
What about you?

3359
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:15,560
I'll stay here to guard the emperor's body and make sure no one follows you.

3360
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:15,840
Okay.

3361
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:17,760
Can I loot the emperor or...?

3362
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:18,900
May Talos guide you.

3363
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:19,460
Okay.

3364
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:21,960
By the way, thanks for recovering Captain Renault's sword.

3365
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:25,700
I'll see that it is given a place of honor in the halls of the blades.

3366
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:26,880
Wait, are you taking my sword?

3367
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:27,760
Don't do that.

3368
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:32,320
Leave the emperor in peace.

3369
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:36,040
Did he just take my sword?

3370
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,520
He did!

3371
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:40,400
You son of a bitch.

3372
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:45,900
Well, good thing we invested everything into bow and arrow, I guess.

3373
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:48,560
Oh my god!

3374
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,780
Why did you take my thing?

3375
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:52,580
Oh no, this guy died too!

3376
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:57,660
He didn't notice.

3377
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:01,940
Take it back.

3378
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:12,800
Oh, he doesn't have it.

3379
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:15,260
Oh my god.

3380
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:17,340
What's...

3381
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:17,700
What are you doing?

3382
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:24,560
We're fine!

3383
02:18:31,610 --> 02:18:32,490
What's wrong?

3384
02:18:33,530 --> 02:18:34,390
What's wrong?

3385
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,710
I'll...

3386
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:37,450
Okay.

3387
02:18:38,250 --> 02:18:39,370
I'll go now.

3388
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:41,530
I'll go now.

3389
02:18:42,270 --> 02:18:44,270
I didn't take anything from you though.

3390
02:18:46,430 --> 02:18:47,690
Kill him and take the sword.

3391
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:48,630
He didn't have it.

3392
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:50,710
He knows what you're thinking.

3393
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:51,610
Clearly.

3394
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:52,350
All right.

3395
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,170
We're sneaky.

3396
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,030
We're sneet.

3397
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:55,210
We're sneet.

3398
02:18:57,550 --> 02:18:58,970
Take his pants.

3399
02:19:00,070 --> 02:19:02,310
By the only one who thinks Minto said...

3400
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:04,150
She can loot the...

3401
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,390
No!

3402
02:19:05,130 --> 02:19:06,250
It's not what I said at all.

3403
02:19:11,490 --> 02:19:12,370
Okay, what if I...

3404
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:17,310
Very easy.

3405
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:20,310
What if I...

3406
02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:24,310
Okay, what if I F5...

3407
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:25,730
And then I do it.

3408
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:26,750
Okay, let's try it now.

3409
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:34,480
Oh.

3410
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,680
It won't let me anymore.

3411
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:37,640
Oh, hi.

3412
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,880
Is it because I...

3413
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,060
Oh, put away the bow?

3414
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:48,620
Don't mind me.

3415
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:49,740
Okay, we'll wait.

3416
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:51,200
We'll wait him to...

3417
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,580
For him to not pay attention anymore.

3418
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,320
All right.

3419
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,960
Oh, you can only try once.

3420
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,800
Oh, Boris has already caught you!

3421
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:02,920
Oh.

3422
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:03,540
Okay.

3423
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:07,780
Fine.

3424
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:11,500
Um...

3425
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:11,780
Oh.

3426
02:20:12,060 --> 02:20:12,920
See the sewers!

3427
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,500
Already caught.

3428
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:20,560
Autosave.

3429
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:24,860
The rats and the goblins.

3430
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:27,460
The rats and the goblins!

3431
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:29,340
Okay.

3432
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:30,900
What a thrill.

3433
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:35,260
Heading in there.

3434
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:40,100
Oh gosh.

3435
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,280
We're gonna be so disgusting.

3436
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:46,600
Can't believe he wouldn't let me take stuff from the emperor's pockets.

3437
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:47,780
Who's gonna...

3438
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:48,780
He doesn't need them anymore.

3439
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:49,140
No?

3440
02:20:53,380 --> 02:20:53,980
What the?

3441
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:58,400
Who are you trying to impress?

3442
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:02,980
I hear something walking, but I don't know what it is.

3443
02:21:08,770 --> 02:21:08,910
All right.

3444
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,450
Let's get him.

3445
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:14,540
Dang!

3446
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:17,760
Let's go!

3447
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,820
One shot kill?

3448
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:24,840
Yeah.

3449
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,020
Yeah.

3450
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,340
Oh yeah, baby.

3451
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:31,600
We're too...

3452
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:32,060
Oh my god.

3453
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:32,420
Cheese!

3454
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:34,460
I'm gonna be heavy though.

3455
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:35,960
No, I'm not.

3456
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:36,860
Just kidding.

3457
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:38,240
Flattered crate.

3458
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:38,860
Flour.

3459
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:41,000
I'm gonna become a baker.

3460
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:43,120
Nevermind.

3461
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:44,220
It was too much.

3462
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,340
It was too much!

3463
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:54,110
Eat the cheese!

3464
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,020
So good.

3465
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:01,820
Oop.

3466
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:03,080
That rat just hopped.

3467
02:22:06,310 --> 02:22:08,050
Is he eating the body, I think?

3468
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:12,860
Oop.

3469
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:13,260
Dang.

3470
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,680
Uh...

3471
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:16,440
Let's see.

3472
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:17,260
Wait.

3473
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:18,420
I wanna...

3474
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:18,860
Uh-oh.

3475
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:19,360
Wasabi.

3476
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:20,640
Wasabi!

3477
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:22,380
Oh, stinking rat.

3478
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,640
Um, I forgot...

3479
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:29,460
I want to put something in our quick...

3480
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,400
You know, under number two.

3481
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:34,400
We'll just put the axe, I guess.

3482
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,020
No.

3483
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:38,360
The sword is better.

3484
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:40,500
Nah, we'll...

3485
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:41,260
Add cheese.

3486
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,000
Add cheese.

3487
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,840
More cheese.

3488
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,940
Less macaroni.

3489
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,520
The sword is better.

3490
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:56,100
I don't even know if we should keep the...

3491
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:56,400
Oh.

3492
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,540
Stupid.

3493
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:05,420
Dummy dumb.

3494
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:06,340
Idiot.

3495
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:14,530
Short sword or dagger?

3496
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:18,350
This is a short sword.

3497
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:25,020
Sneak.

3498
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,300
Up sneak.

3499
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,820
So many bugs.

3500
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:36,440
Matarikon.

3501
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:37,480
Wow, they actually...

3502
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:38,060
Scatter.

3503
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:39,220
That's kind of...

3504
02:23:39,220 --> 02:23:40,240
A fun...

3505
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,040
Detail.

3506
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,260
Is there any point in swimming in there?

3507
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:52,180
Maybe if I want to get diseased?

3508
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:57,460
If I want diseases, I should go in, huh?

3509
02:23:58,940 --> 02:23:59,880
See, you got...

3510
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,780
Garlic!

3511
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,040
Wow.

3512
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:05,560
A real...

3513
02:24:07,420 --> 02:24:09,300
A real chef over here.

3514
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:11,920
Guy was...

3515
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:14,640
He was one day away from opening his own restaurant.

3516
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:17,040
Then I killed him.

3517
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:20,420
Activate?

3518
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,800
The gate is sealed.

3519
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:24,400
Oh, okay.

3520
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:24,800
Phew.

3521
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:30,700
Uh-oh.

3522
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:31,320
Stinky.

3523
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:34,180
Garlic is like the one thing I will...

3524
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:35,680
Be like, you know what?

3525
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:36,280
Worth?

3526
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:38,280
Worth the smell.

3527
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:39,920
I'll eat garlic for...

3528
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,760
I'm a garlic girl.

3529
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:43,280
I don't care if I stink.

3530
02:24:43,460 --> 02:24:44,480
After I eat garlic.

3531
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:45,460
It's tasty.

3532
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:53,120
I keep doing right click to like...

3533
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:53,980
To like...

3534
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,100
Snipe, you know?

3535
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:01,080
Garlic gang.

3536
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:01,760
Yeah!

3537
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:04,540
Ever had pickled garlic?

3538
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:05,780
I don't think so, actually.

3539
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:14,020
Who's in here?

3540
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:16,580
This looks mighty suspicious.

3541
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,360
Like an ambush.

3542
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:22,440
No?

3543
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:23,360
Nothing?

3544
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:24,520
Wait, this gate?

3545
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,440
Click save?

3546
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,060
Okay.

3547
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,580
You can zoom in with higher bow skills.

3548
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:30,940
Ah!

3549
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:31,480
Oh, okay.

3550
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:31,800
Never mind.

3551
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:32,460
This is not a door.

3552
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:35,020
Is this gonna open?

3553
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:37,660
It's sealed.

3554
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:38,920
Okay, I guess we're safe.

3555
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:39,920
Yippee!

3556
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:43,780
Oh!

3557
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:45,300
Oh!

3558
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,900
So they're kind of just like...

3559
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:50,140
Oh, if you didn't like how you played, you can...

3560
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:52,280
So someone did say that you could edit it here.

3561
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:54,680
Last chance.

3562
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:55,460
I think we're good.

3563
02:25:55,460 --> 02:25:57,060
I think we're good, guys.

3564
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:00,840
Choose serpent.

3565
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:01,240
No!

3566
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:03,040
Don't tell me what to do!

3567
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:07,320
I like what I have.

3568
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:09,600
Good spot for a permanent save.

3569
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,400
Oh, that's true.

3570
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:11,900
Wait.

3571
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,840
I did just...

3572
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:15,240
Oh, wait.

3573
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,180
It won't let me, like, get out of this.

3574
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:20,580
Didn't I...

3575
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:21,960
Um...

3576
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:22,940
Um...

3577
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,980
I did do a quick save.

3578
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:26,040
Aw, man.

3579
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:27,860
Escape?

3580
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:28,740
Nah, it doesn't work.

3581
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:30,420
If I click this...

3582
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:30,940
Oh.

3583
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:33,980
Well...

3584
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:34,860
We're committed.

3585
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:36,380
We're committed!

3586
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:39,420
I could F9.

3587
02:26:43,850 --> 02:26:44,430
I could F9.

3588
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:45,790
E-Tina.

3589
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:46,650
Level 1.

3590
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:50,650
Yeah, I could reload the auto.

3591
02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:51,130
No?

3592
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:52,670
Wait.

3593
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:53,310
Uh...

3594
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:53,570
Hello?

3595
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:54,110
What's happening?

3596
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:55,490
Guys, I'm not moving.

3597
02:26:55,710 --> 02:26:56,710
Guys, this is not me.

3598
02:26:56,970 --> 02:26:57,450
Guys?

3599
02:26:57,670 --> 02:26:58,690
Guys, this is not me.

3600
02:26:58,690 --> 02:26:59,270
I...

3601
02:26:59,270 --> 02:27:00,370
My hand is off.

3602
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,710
Guys, my game is glitched.

3603
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:06,070
Guys, this is not me!

3604
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:07,690
Haha.

3605
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,000
Save game.

3606
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,120
New save.

3607
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,040
Oh, wait.

3608
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:28,140
It only got all...

3609
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:28,620
Look at these.

3610
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:30,920
I guess these are...

3611
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,220
These will...

3612
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:33,480
Probably...

3613
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:36,040
Be overwritten though, no?

3614
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:40,850
No way.

3615
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:42,270
We're finally playing the game.

3616
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:43,430
What are you talking about?

3617
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:44,550
This is my first time playing.

3618
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:46,210
Let me...

3619
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:47,370
Let me take my time.

3620
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:55,580
Okay.

3621
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:58,580
And I'm not glitched this time.

3622
02:27:59,060 --> 02:27:59,460
Wow.

3623
02:27:59,640 --> 02:28:00,260
The sunlight.

3624
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:01,440
Oh, my eyes.

3625
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:02,440
Wow.

3626
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:04,520
It's a beautiful day.

3627
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,080
Oh!

3628
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,320
Whose house is that?

3629
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:08,980
Oh.

3630
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:10,080
Whose house is that?

3631
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:11,820
Oh, wow.

3632
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:13,240
We're out of the...

3633
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:13,400
Oh.

3634
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:18,360
The red arrow on your compass shows the direction of Wayne and Priory.

3635
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,740
That's your house?

3636
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:24,140
No.

3637
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:26,840
Not beating the elf allegation.

3638
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:27,560
I'm E.T.

3639
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:28,380
What are you talking about?

3640
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:32,120
You can walk there by following your compass or open your world map to travel there directly.

3641
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:35,800
Or you can set off in any direction and begin exploring the world on your own.

3642
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:36,740
Good luck!

3643
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:39,980
The world on my own.

3644
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,960
I can smell the grass.

3645
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,120
And...

3646
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:44,180
Look at the butterflies.

3647
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:46,160
I can eat the butterflies!

3648
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:50,640
I can just walk!

3649
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:51,220
Wait.

3650
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:51,660
Which way?

3651
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,160
Oh, we do need to go that way.

3652
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:54,460
But what's over here?

3653
02:28:58,560 --> 02:28:59,040
Oops.

3654
02:28:59,240 --> 02:28:59,340
Oops.

3655
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:00,100
Oops.

3656
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:00,120
Oops.

3657
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,140
I did not mean to press that.

3658
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:03,560
I'm intense.

3659
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:07,820
We get the phone home?

3660
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:09,020
Is that a fish?

3661
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:11,600
What the hell is that?

3662
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:17,880
Slatter fish!

3663
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:23,340
Dang, this thing is... tough.

3664
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:26,060
Oh, it's dead.

3665
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:28,140
Scales.

3666
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:32,500
Why is it so tough?

3667
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:36,200
It didn't even do anything.

3668
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:40,020
Is he supposed to be... like, you know... spooky?

3669
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:40,400
Oh!

3670
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:51,970
Clearly, they're just... so...

3671
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:55,090
They're friends, right?

3672
02:29:55,330 --> 02:29:56,990
They're so used to getting slaughtered.

3673
02:29:57,050 --> 02:29:57,390
Oh my gosh.

3674
02:29:57,770 --> 02:29:59,950
I'm... I'm... I'm... Oh no!

3675
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:03,050
The game is too... The game is too powerful for me.

3676
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:04,350
I'm lagging!

3677
02:30:11,770 --> 02:30:12,750
Give me a second.

3678
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:16,650
I'm gonna... Change just a few settings, maybe.

3679
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:24,240
Lock frame rate.

3680
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:25,440
I already did that.

3681
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:29,220
I already did that.

3682
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:29,800
Wait.

3683
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:30,660
Yeah.

3684
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:32,760
I

3685
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:55,550
don't want to change the quality distance... or, like, quality level, but... Hmm.

3686
02:31:01,330 --> 02:31:02,250
Imagining E.T.

3687
02:31:02,290 --> 02:31:04,550
running around with balled up fists going...

3688
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:12,250
Uh... Water reflections off.

3689
02:31:12,410 --> 02:31:12,990
We could do that.

3690
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:17,610
I'll change some things to... High instead of Ultra.

3691
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:23,800
Things that, like, don't really matter.

3692
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:24,420
You know what I mean?

3693
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:29,340
Wait.

3694
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:31,500
Does V-Sync... Should that be on or off?

3695
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,420
I can't ever remember.

3696
02:31:40,210 --> 02:31:40,610
Off.

3697
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:41,450
Okay.

3698
02:31:41,570 --> 02:31:42,270
I already had it off.

3699
02:31:46,930 --> 02:31:48,570
View distance will change that, too.

3700
02:31:48,950 --> 02:31:50,150
I think that'll also help a lot.

3701
02:31:51,490 --> 02:31:52,230
Oh, wait.

3702
02:31:52,370 --> 02:31:52,730
Confirm.

3703
02:31:54,510 --> 02:31:55,090
Okay.

3704
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:55,590
Let's see.

3705
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,510
Ah, buh, buh.

3706
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:56,790
Oh.

3707
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:03,970
Hey!

3708
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:05,470
That helps him.

3709
02:32:07,850 --> 02:32:08,590
What the?

3710
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:09,110
Oh!

3711
02:32:09,130 --> 02:32:09,850
Excuse me!

3712
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,370
Excuse me!

3713
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:13,210
Oh!

3714
02:32:13,290 --> 02:32:14,130
You came after me first!

3715
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:18,580
Uh... Sorry.

3716
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:20,400
Sorry.

3717
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:25,770
You came after me first.

3718
02:32:26,030 --> 02:32:26,470
Self-defense.

3719
02:32:27,650 --> 02:32:28,070
Oh!

3720
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:30,870
I swear!

3721
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:32,270
Gosh, the game is so slow to load now.

3722
02:32:33,290 --> 02:32:34,570
You came after me first!

3723
02:32:35,230 --> 02:32:36,330
It was self-defense!

3724
02:32:36,670 --> 02:32:37,370
I swear!

3725
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:38,670
You brought her!

3726
02:32:39,050 --> 02:32:39,570
You brought her.

3727
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:41,990
Take all your arrows.

3728
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:43,130
Ooh!

3729
02:32:43,330 --> 02:32:43,690
Boots!

3730
02:32:43,890 --> 02:32:44,530
What the fur?

3731
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:45,510
What the fur?

3732
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:46,570
Got the hole.

3733
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:49,230
This is three.

3734
02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:50,130
What am I wearing?

3735
02:32:51,390 --> 02:32:53,190
Do I want to look like a bandit, though?

3736
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:56,370
The breaches.

3737
02:32:58,990 --> 02:33:01,630
You ran into their camp with no warning.

3738
02:33:01,770 --> 02:33:03,190
I was not carrying weapons.

3739
02:33:03,390 --> 02:33:04,310
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3740
02:33:04,530 --> 02:33:05,610
Don't even say that.

3741
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:08,190
I totally had my bow in air.

3742
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:09,490
I had my fists up.

3743
02:33:09,710 --> 02:33:12,350
But I had no weapons equipped.

3744
02:33:12,570 --> 02:33:13,850
You can check the VOD.

3745
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:14,890
You can.

3746
02:33:22,630 --> 02:33:23,770
And a plate.

3747
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:26,450
Wow, I can really just take everything in this game, huh?

3748
02:33:28,430 --> 02:33:30,050
This is on camera.

3749
02:33:30,940 --> 02:33:32,190
Oh, my athletics increased.

3750
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:34,470
Spooked me for a second.

3751
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:37,850
Lettuce and onion and onion.

3752
02:33:38,170 --> 02:33:38,710
What is this?

3753
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:41,010
Where am I?

3754
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:43,150
What's my FOV?

3755
02:33:43,390 --> 02:33:44,310
I have no idea.

3756
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:49,400
A dungeon?

3757
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:50,060
Wait.

3758
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:55,960
Are you a friend?

3759
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:00,160
Huh?

3760
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:02,560
That's why I'm asking you.

3761
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:03,900
Huh?

3762
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:05,180
Are you a friend?

3763
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:05,540
Hello?

3764
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:06,900
Who's there?

3765
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:07,800
Me?

3766
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,640
Should I be here?

3767
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:12,120
Where are you?

3768
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:13,400
Are you talking to me?

3769
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:19,500
How do you hear me?

3770
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:21,420
Hello?

3771
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:24,060
Hello?

3772
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:26,900
Friend?

3773
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,480
Buddy?

3774
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:30,360
Are you a pal?

3775
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:39,510
Whatever it was is gone now.

3776
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:45,640
Sorry.

3777
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:46,760
Oh, he's a bandit.

3778
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:47,140
He's not.

3779
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:47,640
He's not.

3780
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,770
Oh, whatever it is is gone now.

3781
02:34:57,970 --> 02:34:58,150
Yeah.

3782
02:34:58,750 --> 02:34:59,190
You.

3783
02:35:01,710 --> 02:35:02,630
Some torches.

3784
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:04,510
Those are easy to take.

3785
02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:06,950
Oh.

3786
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:08,270
Oh.

3787
02:35:08,530 --> 02:35:09,110
Oh.

3788
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:09,690
Oh.

3789
02:35:09,810 --> 02:35:10,190
Oh.

3790
02:35:11,550 --> 02:35:12,750
Oh my god.

3791
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:14,130
I just.

3792
02:35:14,290 --> 02:35:14,710
I just.

3793
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:15,890
I just walked into that.

3794
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:18,570
Oops.

3795
02:35:19,010 --> 02:35:19,270
Okay.

3796
02:35:19,270 --> 02:35:19,990
There's traps.

3797
02:35:20,530 --> 02:35:21,610
Got it.

3798
02:35:21,890 --> 02:35:22,210
Understood.

3799
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:27,710
Oh my gosh.

3800
02:35:29,070 --> 02:35:30,450
Anything else over here?

3801
02:35:31,170 --> 02:35:31,550
No.

3802
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,300
Friend?

3803
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:45,860
No friends.

3804
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:47,900
We could be.

3805
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,160
Everybody could be a friend.

3806
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:51,720
They just.

3807
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:53,580
Choose.

3808
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:57,200
You think?

3809
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:01,820
What do you think?

3810
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:07,990
Oh, whoops.

3811
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:10,470
Can I take that back?

3812
02:36:10,590 --> 02:36:10,810
Thank you.

3813
02:36:13,250 --> 02:36:14,630
What are you sitting there for?

3814
02:36:14,990 --> 02:36:16,090
We got a big old sack.

3815
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:17,210
Of food.

3816
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:18,510
Yummy.

3817
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:21,970
You guys see that?

3818
02:36:22,170 --> 02:36:22,330
Wait.

3819
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:23,070
How can I?

3820
02:36:24,370 --> 02:36:25,490
How can I?

3821
02:36:26,170 --> 02:36:26,690
Um.

3822
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:30,610
How can I disable the trap?

3823
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:35,870
Oh.

3824
02:36:39,330 --> 02:36:39,850
Oh.

3825
02:36:39,850 --> 02:36:40,010
Wait.

3826
02:36:40,770 --> 02:36:41,410
Activate.

3827
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:44,570
Wow.

3828
02:36:44,670 --> 02:36:47,610
That was pretty anti-climactic knoll.

3829
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:50,630
That was so anti-climactic.

3830
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:56,290
It just dropped.

3831
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:57,490
Like nothing.

3832
02:36:58,630 --> 02:36:58,890
Alright.

3833
02:36:58,990 --> 02:36:59,450
Let's keep going.

3834
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:02,850
Is that my shadow?

3835
02:37:04,130 --> 02:37:04,530
Oh.

3836
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:05,070
That's those.

3837
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:05,430
Okay.

3838
02:37:15,010 --> 02:37:16,010
How big is this?

3839
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:17,310
This place is humongous.

3840
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:19,090
What's the...

3841
02:37:19,090 --> 02:37:20,170
What am I supposed to find in here?

3842
02:37:20,210 --> 02:37:20,730
Big treasure?

3843
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:22,430
Am I gonna become rich?

3844
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,500
It's called puberty?

3845
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:29,520
The balls dropped.

3846
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,620
Junk.

3847
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:32,760
Junk.

3848
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:35,580
This is gonna be more than junk.

3849
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:37,280
It's gonna be...

3850
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,460
Good junk.

3851
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:41,320
Well, maybe good is a...

3852
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:44,840
I hear something over...

3853
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,020
Wait.

3854
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:45,900
Is that a person?

3855
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:47,520
Right there?

3856
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:50,600
I think I see a person right there.

3857
02:37:58,560 --> 02:37:59,380
Got him?

3858
02:38:07,950 --> 02:38:09,790
Didn't even notice a thing?

3859
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:11,090
Got him?

3860
02:38:15,150 --> 02:38:19,010
I think it's very funny that they don't even notice that they're friends.

3861
02:38:20,730 --> 02:38:22,650
Something's like whispering behind me.

3862
02:38:22,930 --> 02:38:23,790
Their friends are dying.

3863
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:31,440
99 plus arrows.

3864
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:35,080
I got 99 arrows and a...

3865
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:39,420
I killed a cat!

3866
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:42,040
Kill me.

3867
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:44,540
I'm so sorry!

3868
02:38:50,610 --> 02:38:51,930
Stone picture.

3869
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:53,030
Flower.

3870
02:38:59,230 --> 02:39:00,130
There you are.

3871
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:02,190
You got any gold on you?

3872
02:39:03,370 --> 02:39:04,330
Moss pick.

3873
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:08,150
More arrows.

3874
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:17,080
My sneak increase.

3875
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,520
We love that brush.

3876
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:23,780
Yeah, baby.

3877
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:25,880
I thought you liked cats.

3878
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:29,120
It's not my fault.

3879
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,440
It's not me.

3880
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:32,800
I promise.

3881
02:39:33,700 --> 02:39:40,580
It's kind of messed up that the gold costs my... It weighs you down.

3882
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:47,880
Because it's like... Because it's like... Oh, wait.

3883
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:48,480
No, it doesn't.

3884
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:49,200
Oh, I was gonna say.

3885
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,400
It discourages you from becoming rich and awesome.

3886
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:53,980
I thought I did.

3887
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:56,660
I thought I... I miss... I miss... Saw.

3888
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:58,580
Zero weight.

3889
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:01,300
No, that's my fault.

3890
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:02,900
Wait, what's this for?

3891
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:05,800
What does that do?

3892
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,560
And it rolls?

3893
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:11,600
Whoa.

3894
02:40:11,980 --> 02:40:12,660
Holy cow.

3895
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:15,740
I forgot.

3896
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:17,320
I think I got a jump buff.

3897
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:17,500
No?

3898
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:18,880
It's a puzzle.

3899
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:19,780
Is it?

3900
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:22,140
Is it actually?

3901
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:29,340
Nobody will live.

3902
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:36,780
No.

3903
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:37,260
Oh.

3904
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:41,300
You guys can't just tell me anything.

3905
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:42,440
I'm gonna believe it.

3906
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:43,360
It's my first time playing.

3907
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:44,600
I'll believe you.

3908
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:46,260
Oh, I'm over-encumbered.

3909
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:47,700
Let's eat some food.

3910
02:40:53,410 --> 02:40:54,530
Let's eat...

3911
02:40:55,270 --> 02:40:56,190
Cheese wedge.

3912
02:40:58,350 --> 02:40:58,910
And...

3913
02:40:58,910 --> 02:40:59,650
Apple.

3914
02:41:00,470 --> 02:41:00,570
Apple.

3915
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:05,080
Wait, what am I wearing?

3916
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:07,480
This.

3917
02:41:08,740 --> 02:41:10,540
That's three armor.

3918
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:13,380
Tina looking sharp, baby.

3919
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:14,000
Oh, yeah.

3920
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:17,740
Drop half my arrows.

3921
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:18,140
No!

3922
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:20,720
They are...

3923
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:22,180
0.1.

3924
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,260
What do you mean I need to drop half of them?

3925
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:25,640
It's 0.1.

3926
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:27,400
They weigh nothing.

3927
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,520
No, I could drop this axe.

3928
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:34,660
Okay.

3929
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:35,780
Bonk.

3930
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:41,160
Oh, eat?

3931
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:41,960
Oh.

3932
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:44,460
Um...

3933
02:41:44,460 --> 02:41:45,980
Well...

3934
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,640
It's... fine.

3935
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:52,000
Probably.

3936
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:54,760
Whatever.

3937
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:55,980
Wait.

3938
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,240
There's his awesome three.

3939
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:00,400
Does he use them up?

3940
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:01,080
Yeah, exactly.

3941
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:06,220
Nothing.

3942
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:11,900
Hold on.

3943
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:16,880
Oh, uh-oh.

3944
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:17,740
Uh-oh.

3945
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:18,480
I'm in trouble.

3946
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:21,180
Uh-oh.

3947
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:21,900
I'm in trouble.

3948
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:23,580
I'm in trouble.

3949
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:28,780
I got him.

3950
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,400
The ringleader.

3951
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:32,220
I got him.

3952
02:42:39,150 --> 02:42:40,710
He's got a fur helmet.

3953
02:42:44,070 --> 02:42:44,710
Easy.

3954
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:46,490
Easy peasy, baby.

3955
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:50,530
What do you got?

3956
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,250
More arrows.

3957
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:54,290
It's so hard not taking them.

3958
02:42:56,330 --> 02:42:57,770
Is anyone else down here?

3959
02:42:57,850 --> 02:42:58,670
Probably not, right?

3960
02:42:59,530 --> 02:43:01,150
What you got over here?

3961
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:06,150
Oh, is that the prize?

3962
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:08,110
A carrot.

3963
02:43:08,650 --> 02:43:09,530
I love carrots.

3964
02:43:10,670 --> 02:43:11,950
Take your sack.

3965
02:43:21,860 --> 02:43:23,300
Bane of being an archer.

3966
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:24,020
I don't know.

3967
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:25,880
I've been pretty successful so far.

3968
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,320
Brief history of the empire.

3969
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:31,100
Part four.

3970
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,460
Oh, I'm gonna... spoilers.

3971
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:34,900
Hold on.

3972
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:36,420
Trank shooting from M.G.S.

3973
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:37,000
Pit off.

3974
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,500
Nah, hold on.

3975
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:41,360
I'll come back here.

3976
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:47,840
I'll come back.

3977
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:52,120
It's another area of the dungeon?

3978
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:53,240
Wait, actually?

3979
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:56,780
No more apples.

3980
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:02,240
Hold on.

3981
02:44:02,340 --> 02:44:03,120
Let's go to the other side.

3982
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:05,840
This place is humongous.

3983
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:08,560
Wait, so if I leave, will they regenerate?

3984
02:44:08,780 --> 02:44:10,200
There's another question I have.

3985
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:13,960
I don't even... oh, wait.

3986
02:44:14,020 --> 02:44:14,560
I came from here.

3987
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:16,540
No?

3988
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:19,220
Oh, so, like, I'll have...

3989
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:20,260
conquered it?

3990
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:21,800
Or...

3991
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:24,100
There will be actually no one else?

3992
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:25,400
Nobody... no one else cares?

3993
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:43,140
Oh, they're asleep here.

3994
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:45,060
Is anybody asleep?

3995
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:47,080
Nope.

3996
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:48,240
No sleepy bandits?

3997
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:51,000
This thing is so cool.

3998
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:52,520
I want all of them.

3999
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,080
Dirty scroll.

4000
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:59,580
Some of the men were worried about these old ruins being haunted.

4001
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:02,380
But Mephala take them.

4002
02:45:02,820 --> 02:45:06,780
This spot's going to be perfect for ambush merchants along the road.

4003
02:45:07,020 --> 02:45:09,940
And all under the nose of the Imperial Legion.

4004
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:13,220
Finally got some of those big blue stones down today.

4005
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:16,540
Berenice got the idea to shoot them down with her bow.

4006
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:18,460
Got them all here with me.

4007
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:21,140
I don't know what they are, but they stink of magicka.

4008
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:23,580
Bet they'll fetch a nice price with the mages' guild.

4009
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:27,040
Two coins and that Khajiit from...

4010
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:28,560
Uh, what was it?

4011
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:29,240
War...

4012
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:30,220
Warden...

4013
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:31,380
Warden Fow...

4014
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:35,320
Set up their camps down the road.

4015
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:36,440
Fine by me.

4016
02:45:36,680 --> 02:45:38,380
Spares the rest of us the smell.

4017
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:40,720
Two coins ran up today.

4018
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:41,420
Two coins?

4019
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:44,260
That's their name?

4020
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:45,160
Two coins?

4021
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:49,480
Warden Fow...

4022
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:50,540
Oh, it's not a W.

4023
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:56,420
Oh.

4024
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:00,140
Oh, ran up today.

4025
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:01,260
The Khajiit's gone missing.

4026
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:06,920
Swore to the nine that you could hear claws scrabbling at limestone, but nothing's down there.

4027
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:10,380
I'm guessing she got tired of the smell and snuck out overnight.

4028
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:14,740
Two coins of stench could peel shells off mud crabs.

4029
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:17,040
I'm surprised she hung around that long.

4030
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:19,040
Okay.

4031
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:21,800
Ink.

4032
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:25,200
I could go to sleep?

4033
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:26,100
I could just...

4034
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:27,020
I could just sleep?

4035
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:29,120
Goodnight?

4036
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:30,820
Corn!

4037
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,760
Wow, they have so much food in here.

4038
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:37,840
Is food, like, really important in this game?

4039
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:41,140
A quick nap.

4040
02:46:43,400 --> 02:46:44,480
Wait, I have to sleep?

4041
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,940
You have to sleep to level up.

4042
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:47,800
Oh, so should I?

4043
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:54,580
Not unless you do alchemy.

4044
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:55,800
Ah, okay, okay.

4045
02:46:58,600 --> 02:46:59,680
Oh, yeah, I don't need to...

4046
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:01,520
What is it gonna tell me, like, when I need to sleep?

4047
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:02,200
Like, hey, buddy.

4048
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:04,080
You are...

4049
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:05,060
Tired.

4050
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:05,840
You need...

4051
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:07,700
Take, like...

4052
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:08,680
You need to take five.

4053
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,660
Yeah, it pops up?

4054
02:47:13,820 --> 02:47:13,940
Okay.

4055
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:17,140
Iron.

4056
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:18,540
Iron boots.

4057
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:20,620
Whoa, claymore.

4058
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:23,640
Green robe hood.

4059
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:27,080
What if it looks good on me?

4060
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:31,000
Icon in top right corner.

4061
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:32,120
When level up is ready.

4062
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:33,280
Ah, okay, okay.

4063
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:35,600
Thank you, guys.

4064
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:36,860
Thank you.

4065
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:41,220
Top left corner.

4066
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:44,420
Top corner.

4067
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:45,360
A corner.

4068
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:56,100
Sorry, but with that face, nothing looks good.

4069
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:01,410
Are you...

4070
02:48:01,410 --> 02:48:02,830
Are you saying I'm...

4071
02:48:03,390 --> 02:48:04,310
Ugly?

4072
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:10,350
Are you...

4073
02:48:10,350 --> 02:48:12,950
Are you saying I'm ugly?

4074
02:48:16,530 --> 02:48:17,310
I'm ugly.

4075
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:22,710
My mama made me like this.

4076
02:48:24,970 --> 02:48:26,770
You're insulting my mother.

4077
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:35,910
Auto save.

4078
02:48:36,510 --> 02:48:37,450
Oh my gosh.

4079
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:42,390
Where's the prize?

4080
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:47,570
Oh my god, this place really is huge.

4081
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:55,680
Holy cannoli.

4082
02:49:00,680 --> 02:49:01,200
Um...

4083
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:02,800
Death penalty.

4084
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:06,320
Two arms!

4085
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,100
Two arms!

4086
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:10,040
Two arms!

4087
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:10,880
Two arms!

4088
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:15,200
Two arms.

4089
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:15,200
Sorry.

4090
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:18,560
Two arms.

4091
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:19,220
Two arms.

4092
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:20,460
Yeah, I got two arms.

4093
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,500
I've also got two eyes.

4094
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:26,640
Weak potion of catastrophe.

4095
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:28,240
Drain luck on self.

4096
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:29,300
Why do you have that?

4097
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:32,780
Two arms.

4098
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:33,760
Two arms.

4099
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:35,180
Two legs.

4100
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:37,760
Two feet.

4101
02:49:38,600 --> 02:49:39,880
Oh, is that a person?

4102
02:49:42,380 --> 02:49:43,920
No, I think it's candles.

4103
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:46,400
Yeah, it's candles.

4104
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:48,060
I think they would have noticed, no?

4105
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,240
Okay.

4106
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:57,820
I keep hearing like a... And I can't tell if it's ambiance or something spooking me, you know?

4107
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:00,740
Sorry.

4108
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:02,320
Two arms.

4109
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:04,720
Maybe that's her name.

4110
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:05,880
Like two coins?

4111
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:07,480
We got two arms.

4112
02:50:08,260 --> 02:50:10,040
And... Um... She's like a Pokemon.

4113
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:12,520
It's just the ghosts.

4114
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:15,500
She's like a Pokemon.

4115
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Yells her name out.

4116
02:50:19,480 --> 02:50:21,460
But what if you lose an arm?

4117
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:23,080
It's like an identity crisis.

4118
02:50:29,890 --> 02:50:32,810
I love how I'm just crouch-walking this entire game.

4119
02:50:34,930 --> 02:50:36,770
That looks like a trap, no?

4120
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:46,300
Oh.

4121
02:50:49,710 --> 02:50:51,090
Maybe it was... Oh.

4122
02:50:51,390 --> 02:50:51,650
Oh.

4123
02:50:52,870 --> 02:50:53,670
Oh.

4124
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:57,790
Secret tunnel.

4125
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:00,730
Two arms.

4126
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:01,270
Oh.

4127
02:51:02,370 --> 02:51:03,830
I didn't do that.

4128
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:04,650
Uh-oh.

4129
02:51:05,970 --> 02:51:07,870
Who's taking... Who's stealing my kills?

4130
02:51:13,180 --> 02:51:15,260
That's... That's stealing my kills.

4131
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:16,060
Oh.

4132
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:16,500
Dang it.

4133
02:51:16,660 --> 02:51:16,840
Oh.

4134
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:17,980
That was... That was unfortunate.

4135
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:22,940
Where'd he go?

4136
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:26,860
Oh.

4137
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:27,580
Dang it.

4138
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:28,940
Oh.

4139
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:29,400
He's fast.

4140
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:30,400
Oh.

4141
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:30,880
He's fast.

4142
02:51:31,720 --> 02:51:32,300
Oh.

4143
02:51:35,750 --> 02:51:36,330
Oh.

4144
02:51:37,910 --> 02:51:38,690
Goodness gracious.

4145
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:41,970
I don't think you can shoot.

4146
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:43,430
Can you?

4147
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:48,000
I'll take my arrows back.

4148
02:51:50,320 --> 02:51:51,620
I'm a zombie now?

4149
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:52,120
No.

4150
02:51:55,700 --> 02:51:57,440
Crouch-walk equals lore accurate.

4151
02:51:58,360 --> 02:51:59,060
I know.

4152
02:51:59,360 --> 02:51:59,880
It's...

4153
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:00,620
Not that.

4154
02:52:01,060 --> 02:52:01,360
No.

4155
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:02,260
That's not true.

4156
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:04,080
But, um...

4157
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:04,780
It's just...

4158
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,520
They get the screen like all dark and everything.

4159
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:07,300
It's just kind of funny.

4160
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:12,020
Oh.

4161
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:13,080
These are so pretty.

4162
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:14,880
Zombo.

4163
02:52:16,580 --> 02:52:17,360
Oh, wait.

4164
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:18,560
We, like, avoided...

4165
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:19,500
A whole big area.

4166
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:21,360
Um...

4167
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:22,980
What are you doing here, anyway?

4168
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:24,540
Dead bandit?

4169
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:27,000
Okay.

4170
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:31,040
Is this, like, a secret room, or...

4171
02:52:36,570 --> 02:52:37,610
Oh, wait.

4172
02:52:38,450 --> 02:52:39,310
This one opened?

4173
02:52:39,670 --> 02:52:39,930
Wait.

4174
02:52:41,010 --> 02:52:41,930
That one opened.

4175
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:45,130
She had more arrows.

4176
02:52:45,410 --> 02:52:46,730
She had non-rusty arrows.

4177
02:52:46,730 --> 02:52:46,990
Wait.

4178
02:52:47,110 --> 02:52:47,690
Actually...

4179
02:52:47,690 --> 02:52:48,470
There's a difference?

4180
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:49,670
I haven't noticed.

4181
02:52:50,470 --> 02:52:50,690
Okay.

4182
02:52:50,730 --> 02:52:51,050
Hold on.

4183
02:52:53,710 --> 02:52:54,650
I'll go back.

4184
02:52:55,770 --> 02:52:56,770
I'll go back.

4185
02:53:03,490 --> 02:53:04,550
Iron arrow.

4186
02:53:08,150 --> 02:53:08,810
Wait, bow?

4187
02:53:09,370 --> 02:53:09,590
Oh!

4188
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:11,770
Because I have a rusty bow.

4189
02:53:12,030 --> 02:53:13,030
Oh, and she has a better bow.

4190
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:14,590
I was going to say.

4191
02:53:15,230 --> 02:53:16,170
The iron's that good.

4192
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:16,910
Or the...

4193
02:53:16,910 --> 02:53:18,130
The arrow's that good?

4194
02:53:19,970 --> 02:53:21,670
Um, and then...

4195
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:22,850
And then...

4196
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:23,610
You.

4197
02:53:24,350 --> 02:53:25,010
Okay.

4198
02:53:27,430 --> 02:53:27,890
Nice.

4199
02:53:28,410 --> 02:53:29,390
Thank you, guys.

4200
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:29,930
Good...

4201
02:53:29,930 --> 02:53:30,450
Good...

4202
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:30,950
Good notice.

4203
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:36,380
We gaming?

4204
02:53:37,020 --> 02:53:37,540
Yeah.

4205
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,720
Thanks to you guys.

4206
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:40,340
Hehe.

4207
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:42,960
I wouldn't have noticed.

4208
02:53:49,710 --> 02:53:50,530
More zombo?

4209
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:51,230
Yep.

4210
02:53:53,410 --> 02:53:55,010
Let's test out our new...

4211
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:56,790
Oh, nice.

4212
02:53:56,910 --> 02:53:57,850
That big damage.

4213
02:53:58,290 --> 02:53:58,790
Oh, sh...

4214
02:53:58,790 --> 02:53:59,470
Oh, I got him.

4215
02:54:00,770 --> 02:54:01,690
Big damage.

4216
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:08,380
Why are there zombies in here?

4217
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:15,700
They're freaking me out.

4218
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:22,360
Whoa.

4219
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:23,340
Whoa.

4220
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:25,160
Do I need to put that up there?

4221
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:26,260
Ah!

4222
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:29,400
Just kidding.

4223
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:32,300
The treasure room.

4224
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:32,920
Please.

4225
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:33,800
Please.

4226
02:54:34,220 --> 02:54:35,240
The treasure room.

4227
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:37,660
The treasure room.

4228
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:40,620
Oh, this is a chest.

4229
02:54:43,160 --> 02:54:43,960
Oh.

4230
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:46,640
Weak potion of charisma.

4231
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:48,120
What do you mean?

4232
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:49,400
I lose personality.

4233
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,280
I'm so charismatic.

4234
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,920
Is that a skelly?

4235
02:54:58,720 --> 02:54:59,720
Riz potion.

4236
02:55:10,660 --> 02:55:11,640
Oh, I see him.

4237
02:55:19,860 --> 02:55:20,940
I don't...

4238
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:22,400
Definitely don't think that was a headshot.

4239
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:24,000
The first one, at least.

4240
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:25,900
Oh, it's just water.

4241
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:27,440
Anybody else in here?

4242
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:29,620
It's so dark.

4243
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:30,380
It's so dark.

4244
02:55:32,920 --> 02:55:34,320
Oh, there's more.

4245
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:36,800
Bone meal.

4246
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:41,300
Wait.

4247
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,340
Oh my gosh.

4248
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:44,120
I can go in here.

4249
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:49,740
Dodge.

4250
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:54,580
There's...

4251
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:56,120
There's a whole passageway.

4252
02:55:58,780 --> 02:56:00,800
There's a whole passageway down there, you guys.

4253
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:02,000
I don't think we can make it, though.

4254
02:56:05,260 --> 02:56:07,520
I don't think we can make it, because...

4255
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:09,600
I don't have enough.

4256
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:13,080
You could try.

4257
02:56:13,380 --> 02:56:13,940
You can?

4258
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:14,860
I can.

4259
02:56:16,420 --> 02:56:17,200
I'll quick save.

4260
02:56:17,200 --> 02:56:18,620
All right, here we go.

4261
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:21,260
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4262
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:26,520
Oh, oh, oh.

4263
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:27,220
Oh!

4264
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:33,620
Oh, shoot.

4265
02:56:41,740 --> 02:56:42,640
We're fine.

4266
02:56:42,820 --> 02:56:43,420
Everything's fine.

4267
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:50,640
We managed to avoid drowning.

4268
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:52,960
Back to sneak.

4269
02:56:54,880 --> 02:56:56,940
I kind of miss the humans.

4270
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:58,860
Or not humans, but you know.

4271
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:01,760
Wait.

4272
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:05,020
I'm so lost in here now, you guys.

4273
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:08,340
Ow,

4274
02:57:12,110 --> 02:57:12,570
what the hell?

4275
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:14,710
What the?

4276
02:57:18,650 --> 02:57:19,590
Uh-oh.

4277
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:20,850
What

4278
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:27,360
the hell?

4279
02:57:27,620 --> 02:57:28,480
Uh-oh.

4280
02:57:52,780 --> 02:57:55,540
Maybe I don't understand how lockpicking works.

4281
02:57:56,240 --> 02:57:57,660
Maybe I don't understand.

4282
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:11,740
Oh.

4283
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:18,100
Maybe I do understand how lockpicking works.

4284
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:20,380
Is this the room we were in before?

4285
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:22,900
Yeah.

4286
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:24,340
We're through... yeah?

4287
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:26,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4288
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:26,820
Yeah, yeah.

4289
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:27,840
So we went...

4290
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:29,880
A long ways away.

4291
02:58:31,420 --> 02:58:32,400
First try?

4292
02:58:35,360 --> 02:58:36,440
First try?

4293
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:39,780
Probably?

4294
02:58:41,820 --> 02:58:42,500
Okay.

4295
02:58:43,300 --> 02:58:45,300
I know there was that other area.

4296
02:58:48,480 --> 02:58:49,720
Are these all doors?

4297
02:58:50,740 --> 02:58:52,520
Is that a skelly in there?

4298
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:53,340
Oh!

4299
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:54,800
There's a skelly in there!

4300
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:04,460
Safe?

4301
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:04,980
Yeah.

4302
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:05,800
Wait.

4303
02:59:05,960 --> 02:59:06,980
I haven't checked my map.

4304
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:09,440
And well, um... I don't have a map of this area.

4305
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:12,060
Dorigo, thank you so much for the tiny gift that I give you.

4306
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:14,770
What if I...

4307
02:59:22,140 --> 02:59:23,520
Can I get you through the hole?

4308
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:25,560
Let's try.

4309
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:28,100
Through the hole.

4310
02:59:31,930 --> 02:59:32,870
Where'd that go?

4311
02:59:39,230 --> 02:59:39,950
There's one!

4312
02:59:40,170 --> 02:59:41,330
Wait, this is a dungeon.

4313
02:59:42,090 --> 02:59:43,230
This is their prison.

4314
02:59:47,800 --> 02:59:48,700
Oh, nevermind.

4315
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:52,380
They sure are pretty.

4316
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:01,160
That really is their prison.

4317
03:00:01,940 --> 03:00:03,200
Do you have anything in there?

4318
03:00:03,340 --> 03:00:04,820
There's no point in going in, no?

4319
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:07,880
Free the sca... Oh, hi.

4320
03:00:13,560 --> 03:00:14,080
Sorry.

4321
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:18,920
Free the sca... No.

4322
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:26,140
Alright, let's go to that other room.

4323
03:00:38,920 --> 03:00:39,900
So jumpy.

4324
03:00:40,140 --> 03:00:41,140
Oh, he must be new here.

4325
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:44,100
He must be new here.

4326
03:00:50,270 --> 03:00:51,670
Could be hidden treasure.

4327
03:00:54,250 --> 03:00:55,410
I hear a guy.

4328
03:00:57,950 --> 03:00:59,170
I hear a guy.

4329
03:01:00,790 --> 03:01:01,370
Wow!

4330
03:01:01,930 --> 03:01:02,190
Wow!

4331
03:01:02,370 --> 03:01:04,650
That's like the most obvious trap I've ever seen.

4332
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:08,130
Where is he?

4333
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:09,710
I missed her.

4334
03:01:11,290 --> 03:01:13,890
Um... Which one should I not step on?

4335
03:01:17,230 --> 03:01:21,030
Uh... Which one should I... Where should I not step?

4336
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:23,450
This one?

4337
03:01:23,950 --> 03:01:24,770
This one?

4338
03:01:25,710 --> 03:01:26,490
This one?

4339
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:28,590
I hear him.

4340
03:01:28,770 --> 03:01:29,890
I hear him over there.

4341
03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:33,470
All the blue stones can be looted?

4342
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:34,570
Yeah, I didn't know that.

4343
03:01:35,070 --> 03:01:35,310
Oh.

4344
03:01:36,350 --> 03:01:37,350
I think I can... Oh.

4345
03:01:37,810 --> 03:01:38,230
Uh, wait.

4346
03:01:38,230 --> 03:01:38,250
Wait.

4347
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:50,120
I'm going.

4348
03:01:51,700 --> 03:01:52,160
Oh.

4349
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:52,520
Okay.

4350
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:56,940
Yeah, I didn't want to take so many because they're...

4351
03:01:56,940 --> 03:01:59,960
But they... They do... They do sell for a pretty penny, huh?

4352
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:03,440
I didn't want to get over encumbered, but...

4353
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:06,560
I guess... It'd be good to take more of them, huh?

4354
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:09,820
You're pretty good.

4355
03:02:10,700 --> 03:02:11,160
Thanks.

4356
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:11,700
Thanks.

4357
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:14,420
I like sniping.

4358
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:23,520
Oh.

4359
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:26,340
I say as I... You know.

4360
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:29,220
Oh, shoot.

4361
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:30,940
That wasn't as good.

4362
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:31,460
Ah!

4363
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:32,540
Crap!

4364
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:38,500
We're fine.

4365
03:02:38,660 --> 03:02:39,280
Everything's fine.

4366
03:02:39,940 --> 03:02:40,860
Take your stone.

4367
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:41,640
Take your stone.

4368
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:42,880
I take your stone.

4369
03:02:43,140 --> 03:02:44,900
Whose... Whose... Whose grave is this?

4370
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:45,380
Doesn't matter.

4371
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:46,100
I take your stone.

4372
03:02:47,240 --> 03:02:47,480
Oh!

4373
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:47,940
Oh!

4374
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:49,060
I'm too good of a jumper.

4375
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,280
Oh, God!

4376
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:51,300
I'm the best jumper ever!

4377
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:52,180
Wait!

4378
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:54,320
This is what they meant by increased?

4379
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:56,420
I'm over encumbered.

4380
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:02,400
I saw some people say that I can...

4381
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:03,180
Oh!

4382
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:04,180
I see.

4383
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:04,580
I see.

4384
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:07,840
If I zoom in...

4385
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:08,560
Let's see.

4386
03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:09,460
What do we want to get rid of?

4387
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:13,360
We love acrobatics.

4388
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:15,700
There's an amulet!

4389
03:03:15,880 --> 03:03:18,620
I could sell it for a thousand gold, though, you guys.

4390
03:03:21,320 --> 03:03:21,960
Pretty tempting!

4391
03:03:22,980 --> 03:03:23,620
Pretty tempting!

4392
03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:30,010
Oh, that looks horrible.

4393
03:03:32,990 --> 03:03:34,830
God, I can't get over how much it looks like...

4394
03:03:34,830 --> 03:03:35,210
Actually!

4395
03:03:37,470 --> 03:03:39,810
I was gonna say, I can't believe how much it looks like E.T.

4396
03:03:39,810 --> 03:03:40,730
But, you know what?

4397
03:03:42,770 --> 03:03:45,310
I think I'm kind of seeing the Crypt Keeper.

4398
03:03:47,370 --> 03:03:48,150
Drop the shield.

4399
03:03:48,650 --> 03:03:49,830
Yeah, we can get rid of the shield.

4400
03:03:50,150 --> 03:03:51,790
I think I'm seeing the Crypt Keeper.

4401
03:03:59,650 --> 03:04:01,110
Give me my arrows back.

4402
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:02,310
My arrow.

4403
03:04:05,610 --> 03:04:06,990
Oh, okay.

4404
03:04:09,470 --> 03:04:10,810
We came from here.

4405
03:04:12,150 --> 03:04:13,150
Or...

4406
03:04:13,150 --> 03:04:13,330
Yes.

4407
03:04:13,770 --> 03:04:14,270
Yes?

4408
03:04:15,550 --> 03:04:16,170
Oh.

4409
03:04:17,050 --> 03:04:18,390
Thought someone saw me.

4410
03:04:19,090 --> 03:04:19,970
Do-do-do-do.

4411
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:27,970
Ruh-ruh!

4412
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:31,350
Uh-oh.

4413
03:04:33,930 --> 03:04:34,730
Ruh-ruh!

4414
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:47,640
I'm gonna die.

4415
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:51,100
Where is he?

4416
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:51,660
Where is he?

4417
03:04:52,980 --> 03:04:54,080
I heard him.

4418
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:56,780
Ruh-roh!

4419
03:05:00,150 --> 03:05:00,730
Oh.

4420
03:05:01,270 --> 03:05:02,350
Didn't realize that was a wall.

4421
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:05,030
Where is he?

4422
03:05:05,130 --> 03:05:05,850
Is there anybody in there?

4423
03:05:07,550 --> 03:05:08,190
Hello?

4424
03:05:08,630 --> 03:05:09,030
Hello?

4425
03:05:10,430 --> 03:05:11,070
Oh.

4426
03:05:11,850 --> 03:05:12,490
Oh.

4427
03:05:13,430 --> 03:05:14,070
Oh.

4428
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:15,110
Oh.

4429
03:05:18,590 --> 03:05:20,210
Like, Zoic Scoob.

4430
03:05:21,110 --> 03:05:22,650
That don't look so good.

4431
03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:24,770
Actually, that blood is like so fresh.

4432
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:26,930
The blood is so fresh in the boat.

4433
03:05:27,230 --> 03:05:29,270
They decompose at the speed of light.

4434
03:05:33,490 --> 03:05:35,030
I'm hearing whispers.

4435
03:05:35,090 --> 03:05:36,630
I'm going crazy.

4436
03:05:37,250 --> 03:05:38,850
I'm going so crazy.

4437
03:05:39,990 --> 03:05:40,590
Hard!

4438
03:05:41,190 --> 03:05:41,750
Okay.

4439
03:05:42,090 --> 03:05:42,370
All right.

4440
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:46,790
Let's, um...

4441
03:05:46,790 --> 03:05:48,810
Figure this out, huh?

4442
03:05:50,010 --> 03:05:50,790
Wait.

4443
03:05:50,910 --> 03:05:51,010
Who?

4444
03:05:51,190 --> 03:05:51,370
Where?

4445
03:05:52,150 --> 03:05:52,750
Oh.

4446
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:53,050
Where?

4447
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:53,890
Whomst?

4448
03:05:54,030 --> 03:05:54,430
Where?

4449
03:05:55,690 --> 03:05:56,310
Uh.

4450
03:05:57,800 --> 03:05:58,190
Uh.

4451
03:05:58,890 --> 03:05:59,170
Yep.

4452
03:05:59,890 --> 03:06:00,350
Yeah!

4453
03:06:01,550 --> 03:06:02,050
Yeah!

4454
03:06:02,890 --> 03:06:03,690
Uh-uh-duh-duh.

4455
03:06:03,890 --> 03:06:04,210
Uh.

4456
03:06:04,650 --> 03:06:04,890
Uh.

4457
03:06:05,290 --> 03:06:05,470
K.

4458
03:06:06,170 --> 03:06:07,090
Somebody's here.

4459
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:08,730
They're gonna...

4460
03:06:08,730 --> 03:06:09,310
Attack.

4461
03:06:13,150 --> 03:06:13,540
Somebody's...

4462
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:16,270
Red dot.

4463
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:26,000
The red dot.

4464
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,140
Must be the wind.

4465
03:06:34,220 --> 03:06:35,460
Um, let's see.

4466
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:41,320
Oh

4467
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:52,560
my god.

4468
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:53,700
I think I messed up, you guys.

4469
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:54,660
I think I messed up.

4470
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:55,520
Ah!

4471
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:11,960
Where are you?

4472
03:07:12,160 --> 03:07:12,500
There you go.

4473
03:07:12,820 --> 03:07:13,160
Ah!

4474
03:07:18,190 --> 03:07:18,990
Take that!

4475
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:19,450
Oh.

4476
03:07:19,930 --> 03:07:20,370
Oops.

4477
03:07:20,550 --> 03:07:21,210
I'm blocked in.

4478
03:07:21,970 --> 03:07:22,770
I'm looping him.

4479
03:07:23,090 --> 03:07:23,310
Ouch.

4480
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:24,110
I didn't loop them.

4481
03:07:24,190 --> 03:07:24,910
I didn't loop them at all.

4482
03:07:25,350 --> 03:07:25,950
Where are they?

4483
03:07:26,390 --> 03:07:27,090
Oh, there they are.

4484
03:07:28,450 --> 03:07:29,130
I'm gonna die.

4485
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:30,710
Just kidding.

4486
03:07:31,170 --> 03:07:31,830
It is you.

4487
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:33,630
Why are you so strong for a skeleton?

4488
03:07:36,650 --> 03:07:36,970
Run!

4489
03:07:37,390 --> 03:07:37,710
Run!

4490
03:07:38,310 --> 03:07:38,910
Where is he?

4491
03:07:39,070 --> 03:07:39,570
Oh, there he is.

4492
03:07:40,750 --> 03:07:41,530
Just one more hit.

4493
03:07:44,710 --> 03:07:46,770
We're fine.

4494
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:51,690
I shouldn't press buttons willy-nilly.

4495
03:07:52,410 --> 03:07:53,550
I think.

4496
03:07:58,360 --> 03:07:59,300
My heal.

4497
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:04,240
What's this?

4498
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:06,780
Oh.

4499
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:11,540
I'll take them.

4500
03:08:13,580 --> 03:08:14,820
Who sees me, though?

4501
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:17,200
It must be the guys behind the walls.

4502
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:17,840
I imagine.

4503
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:20,300
I imagine.

4504
03:08:20,520 --> 03:08:21,380
I think I...

4505
03:08:21,380 --> 03:08:23,200
I can't remember...

4506
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:24,080
Uh, three.

4507
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:27,240
Three.

4508
03:08:28,060 --> 03:08:28,520
Three.

4509
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:29,400
Three.

4510
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:31,860
Just get rid of that, and then three.

4511
03:08:32,340 --> 03:08:32,660
Three?

4512
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:33,420
Oh, wait.

4513
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:34,060
Do I see?

4514
03:08:35,900 --> 03:08:36,560
Okay.

4515
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:37,780
Where...

4516
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:38,800
Did that do anything?

4517
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,940
Oh, like the tiniest amount.

4518
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:46,860
But you...

4519
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:47,740
But I think...

4520
03:08:47,740 --> 03:08:50,100
Because we're still technically in battle...

4521
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:51,380
I won't...

4522
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:52,900
Regen health, huh?

4523
03:08:56,360 --> 03:08:57,020
Is...

4524
03:08:57,020 --> 03:08:58,320
What I think is the case?

4525
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:01,740
Get stronger as you level it up.

4526
03:09:01,860 --> 03:09:02,040
Okay.

4527
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:05,920
Oh, just slowly.

4528
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:06,720
Oh, yeah.

4529
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:08,120
I can actually see it a little bit.

4530
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:08,720
Okay.

4531
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:10,520
Um...

4532
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:11,460
Do I just like...

4533
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:12,340
Get all these in?

4534
03:09:23,280 --> 03:09:25,220
Okay, I won't press all of them at once.

4535
03:09:28,420 --> 03:09:30,220
I'll press them one at a time.

4536
03:09:35,210 --> 03:09:36,830
I'll press them one at a time.

4537
03:09:37,030 --> 03:09:37,870
So that, you know...

4538
03:09:39,690 --> 03:09:40,450
Ah, damn.

4539
03:09:40,930 --> 03:09:41,730
Oh, where'd he go?

4540
03:09:48,250 --> 03:09:49,550
It's so dark in there.

4541
03:09:50,910 --> 03:09:51,350
Yeah.

4542
03:09:51,950 --> 03:09:52,170
Okay.

4543
03:09:53,150 --> 03:09:53,590
Oh!

4544
03:09:53,810 --> 03:09:54,530
Wrong block.

4545
03:09:54,950 --> 03:09:55,470
Wrong one.

4546
03:09:55,650 --> 03:09:55,910
This one.

4547
03:10:00,690 --> 03:10:02,010
See, and now...

4548
03:10:02,010 --> 03:10:03,450
They don't know I'm here.

4549
03:10:04,110 --> 03:10:04,550
Wait.

4550
03:10:04,770 --> 03:10:05,370
Where's the opening?

4551
03:10:06,990 --> 03:10:08,150
Where the hell is this guy?

4552
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:12,110
Mister?

4553
03:10:12,370 --> 03:10:13,370
What are you doing in the corner?

4554
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:18,030
Oh, yeah.

4555
03:10:18,030 --> 03:10:18,070
Oh, yeah.

4556
03:10:18,110 --> 03:10:18,790
Where is he?

4557
03:10:19,450 --> 03:10:20,650
That's the guy I killed, no?

4558
03:10:27,650 --> 03:10:29,970
Maybe I was never ever supposed to open these.

4559
03:10:31,790 --> 03:10:32,750
It's empty.

4560
03:10:36,350 --> 03:10:37,630
Who killed you?

4561
03:10:37,890 --> 03:10:38,250
Who...

4562
03:10:38,250 --> 03:10:38,750
He died...

4563
03:10:39,090 --> 03:10:39,130
He died...

4564
03:10:39,130 --> 03:10:40,470
Of boredom...

4565
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:42,390
Waiting for somebody.

4566
03:10:43,410 --> 03:10:44,890
I also saw this here.

4567
03:10:48,230 --> 03:10:49,030
A key...

4568
03:10:52,930 --> 03:10:54,530
Check the other room for coffins.

4569
03:10:55,810 --> 03:10:56,830
I guess we...

4570
03:10:58,910 --> 03:10:59,790
Oh, wait.

4571
03:10:59,970 --> 03:11:00,790
Did I get this one?

4572
03:11:00,990 --> 03:11:01,350
Yeah.

4573
03:11:04,190 --> 03:11:05,310
Oh, this one has one too.

4574
03:11:08,030 --> 03:11:08,430
Okay.

4575
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:09,230
Maybe...

4576
03:11:09,230 --> 03:11:11,070
More potion of heal...

4577
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:11,730
Oh, not bad.

4578
03:11:12,090 --> 03:11:13,730
More potion of healing will take it.

4579
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:16,490
Okey-dokey.

4580
03:11:17,930 --> 03:11:18,470
Oh!

4581
03:11:18,690 --> 03:11:20,330
Maybe this is what opened up.

4582
03:11:20,550 --> 03:11:21,150
I see.

4583
03:11:22,330 --> 03:11:23,410
Oh, so...

4584
03:11:24,550 --> 03:11:25,730
I just messed up.

4585
03:11:26,010 --> 03:11:26,790
I should have...

4586
03:11:28,150 --> 03:11:30,150
I only needed the one key.

4587
03:11:30,470 --> 03:11:30,650
Literally.

4588
03:11:31,910 --> 03:11:33,490
Is this the treasure room?

4589
03:11:33,690 --> 03:11:34,930
This is the treasure room.

4590
03:11:35,310 --> 03:11:36,550
This is the treasure room!

4591
03:11:37,010 --> 03:11:39,310
Literally, the last door that I did...

4592
03:11:39,310 --> 03:11:40,410
In the puzzle...

4593
03:11:40,410 --> 03:11:41,630
Was the one that I needed.

4594
03:11:41,930 --> 03:11:42,570
The only thing.

4595
03:11:43,790 --> 03:11:44,330
Oh, shoot.

4596
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:51,930
Okay.

4597
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:57,110
Still Skelly's guarding the place.

4598
03:11:57,950 --> 03:11:59,450
Give me the...

4599
03:11:59,450 --> 03:12:00,570
Oh, shoot.

4600
03:12:01,550 --> 03:12:02,330
Oh, shoot.

4601
03:12:03,290 --> 03:12:03,850
Woo!

4602
03:12:05,890 --> 03:12:07,110
Yeah, take that.

4603
03:12:07,390 --> 03:12:08,730
I don't know how I knocked your...

4604
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:09,870
Your feet off.

4605
03:12:10,390 --> 03:12:12,630
I knocked him off his feet!

4606
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:22,580
Varvla stone cage activate.

4607
03:12:22,980 --> 03:12:24,240
Is there anything...

4608
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:25,740
Wait, is this a tunnel way?

4609
03:12:33,850 --> 03:12:35,570
I feel like I am...

4610
03:12:36,670 --> 03:12:37,230
Playing...

4611
03:12:37,230 --> 03:12:38,690
Half-Life with how much...

4612
03:12:38,690 --> 03:12:39,410
I am quick saving.

4613
03:12:39,670 --> 03:12:40,710
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4614
03:12:46,110 --> 03:12:46,610
Ugh!

4615
03:12:51,630 --> 03:12:53,870
This cage is raised remotely.

4616
03:13:01,300 --> 03:13:01,820
This?

4617
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:03,240
No?

4618
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:05,220
Which way?

4619
03:13:06,360 --> 03:13:07,840
This is the large...

4620
03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:09,840
This is the hugest dungeon ever.

4621
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:11,640
Button upstairs.

4622
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:12,600
Okay.

4623
03:13:15,360 --> 03:13:16,500
Yeah, that's what I figured.

4624
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:17,640
I didn't know if there was like...

4625
03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:18,180
Other doorways.

4626
03:13:18,340 --> 03:13:19,540
That's just why I was looking around.

4627
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:20,900
Ah!

4628
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:22,160
Ah!

4629
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,800
But before we do that...

4630
03:13:29,820 --> 03:13:31,320
See if anybody's in here.

4631
03:13:31,600 --> 03:13:32,200
No way.

4632
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:33,080
Oh my god!

4633
03:13:33,140 --> 03:13:33,640
There's more!

4634
03:13:35,260 --> 03:13:36,380
There's more!

4635
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:41,780
Sancremati.

4636
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:41,940
Let's see.

4637
03:13:45,930 --> 03:13:47,090
Okie dokie.

4638
03:13:49,370 --> 03:13:50,250
Beep!

4639
03:13:51,610 --> 03:13:53,490
That looks valuable.

4640
03:13:59,010 --> 03:14:01,150
Did it open anything else?

4641
03:14:01,830 --> 03:14:04,270
Any other skellies behind doors?

4642
03:14:06,470 --> 03:14:07,810
The treasure!

4643
03:14:08,530 --> 03:14:16,430
I'm sorry, this is worth as much as the... the... as much as the amulet given to me by the king?!

4644
03:14:19,430 --> 03:14:20,290
Valuable, baby.

4645
03:14:20,470 --> 03:14:21,490
Money, money, money, money.

4646
03:14:21,610 --> 03:14:22,450
It pays to steal!

4647
03:14:27,650 --> 03:14:28,090
Freedom?

4648
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:57,620
Bada-boom, baby.

4649
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:00,540
Bada-bing, bada-boom, baby.

4650
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:06,300
Oh, there's a lot of whispers happening now.

4651
03:15:07,880 --> 03:15:08,580
Oh, oh, oh!

4652
03:15:09,360 --> 03:15:10,220
Did I do that?

4653
03:15:14,790 --> 03:15:16,790
We can do this easy.

4654
03:15:19,710 --> 03:15:20,590
Am I in between?

4655
03:15:23,510 --> 03:15:24,710
Actually, I can just run.

4656
03:15:25,790 --> 03:15:26,730
Oh my gosh!

4657
03:15:30,050 --> 03:15:30,590
Statue.

4658
03:15:30,590 --> 03:15:31,410
That's cool.

4659
03:15:31,650 --> 03:15:32,970
I'm over encumbered again.

4660
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:34,570
I've got too much loot.

4661
03:15:36,230 --> 03:15:36,710
Let's...

4662
03:15:36,710 --> 03:15:37,610
Gotta eat more...

4663
03:15:37,610 --> 03:15:38,550
You guys, we gotta...

4664
03:15:38,550 --> 03:15:39,010
We gotta...

4665
03:15:39,010 --> 03:15:39,870
We gotta eat stuff.

4666
03:15:41,110 --> 03:15:41,590
Cheese!

4667
03:15:41,950 --> 03:15:42,390
Corn!

4668
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:45,030
Chomp, chomp, chomp!

4669
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:45,910
The...

4670
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:47,530
This armor's not gonna fit...

4671
03:15:47,530 --> 03:15:49,090
Fit us by the end of the...

4672
03:15:49,090 --> 03:15:49,390
This...

4673
03:15:49,390 --> 03:15:50,590
The garlic weighs literally nothing.

4674
03:15:53,130 --> 03:15:53,610
Lettuce!

4675
03:15:53,710 --> 03:15:54,910
Why is the lettuce so heavy?

4676
03:16:02,630 --> 03:16:04,450
Oh my goodness, which way do I go?

4677
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:07,810
Oh, sorry.

4678
03:16:07,990 --> 03:16:08,230
My bad.

4679
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,660
Bear pelt is useless, is it?

4680
03:16:14,020 --> 03:16:14,660
I'll get rid of it.

4681
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:15,920
Well, I don't wanna get...

4682
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:16,180
Hold on.

4683
03:16:16,340 --> 03:16:17,220
I don't wanna get one guide.

4684
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:18,500
Is it useless, you guys?

4685
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:21,040
Heavy lettuce.

4686
03:16:24,040 --> 03:16:25,260
Gotta find a merchant soon.

4687
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:26,300
I know, right?

4688
03:16:27,460 --> 03:16:28,700
Sort by weight.

4689
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:31,720
My iron grieves.

4690
03:16:33,520 --> 03:16:34,540
Our grievance.

4691
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:37,380
Toss it.

4692
03:16:37,580 --> 03:16:38,860
It's worth the irony.

4693
03:16:41,780 --> 03:16:43,520
Why do you look like E.T.?

4694
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:44,720
Cuz I am E.T.

4695
03:16:45,260 --> 03:16:45,640
Hello.

4696
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:47,640
Please meet E.Tina.

4697
03:16:50,620 --> 03:16:51,300
Please...

4698
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:52,660
Meet your...

4699
03:16:52,660 --> 03:16:55,600
It's your number one extraterrestrial gal.

4700
03:16:56,020 --> 03:16:56,740
E.Tina.

4701
03:17:00,100 --> 03:17:01,880
Okay, I'll get rid of the bear pelt.

4702
03:17:04,100 --> 03:17:05,660
And we'll go...

4703
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:10,400
If you're going in a maze, go left.

4704
03:17:18,400 --> 03:17:21,420
Oh my gosh!

4705
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:22,580
I went the wrong way.

4706
03:17:25,240 --> 03:17:26,260
Look at their little...

4707
03:17:26,980 --> 03:17:27,300
caskets.

4708
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:28,720
No.

4709
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:34,200
Nothing.

4710
03:17:40,210 --> 03:17:41,610
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4711
03:17:42,350 --> 03:17:43,390
Okay, this way.

4712
03:17:44,190 --> 03:17:45,370
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4713
03:17:47,470 --> 03:17:47,790
Wait!

4714
03:17:47,990 --> 03:17:49,090
This might be an exit?

4715
03:17:49,970 --> 03:17:50,670
Actually, hold on.

4716
03:17:50,710 --> 03:17:51,950
I wanna check the other side too, though.

4717
03:17:54,230 --> 03:17:55,650
I wanna check this side too, though.

4718
03:17:58,070 --> 03:17:59,130
Oh, it's a door.

4719
03:18:00,730 --> 03:18:01,730
Easy gate.

4720
03:18:02,550 --> 03:18:03,830
We haven't been in here before.

4721
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:16,900
Oh, I should've done it there.

4722
03:18:49,500 --> 03:18:51,720
I don't think I understand it.

4723
03:18:54,060 --> 03:18:54,660
Oh!

4724
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:03,200
I got it.

4725
03:19:16,150 --> 03:19:16,990
Oh, I think...

4726
03:19:16,990 --> 03:19:18,590
Oh, what I'm hearing is the...

4727
03:19:18,590 --> 03:19:19,150
swinging.

4728
03:19:22,350 --> 03:19:24,610
I thought I was hearing something, like...

4729
03:19:26,470 --> 03:19:27,270
making noise.

4730
03:19:27,530 --> 03:19:28,430
Or like a...

4731
03:19:28,430 --> 03:19:30,090
You know, a little guy, but...

4732
03:19:31,010 --> 03:19:32,470
Okay, well there's just this in here.

4733
03:19:34,450 --> 03:19:35,910
And it's more potions.

4734
03:19:39,070 --> 03:19:41,270
But if I take them, I'll be...

4735
03:19:41,850 --> 03:19:44,110
So this one really had nothing.

4736
03:19:44,290 --> 03:19:45,490
Well, they both had nothing, I guess.

4737
03:19:46,290 --> 03:19:46,630
Okay.

4738
03:19:48,490 --> 03:19:49,630
Run, run, run.

4739
03:19:50,970 --> 03:19:51,970
And you...

4740
03:19:51,970 --> 03:19:53,610
Run, run, run.

4741
03:19:54,030 --> 03:19:55,490
And up we go.

4742
03:19:56,510 --> 03:19:57,190
All right.

4743
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:07,520
You think it's a friend?

4744
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:11,660
They're not dressed like the others.

4745
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:14,640
Hi.

4746
03:20:18,840 --> 03:20:19,300
Hi.

4747
03:20:21,200 --> 03:20:22,440
It's never a friend.

4748
03:20:23,860 --> 03:20:24,540
Guess it was nothing.

4749
03:20:26,380 --> 03:20:27,420
Guess it was nothing.

4750
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:28,220
Okay.

4751
03:20:32,080 --> 03:20:33,860
Now we have to deal with men!

4752
03:20:34,960 --> 03:20:35,420
Skellies!

4753
03:20:35,900 --> 03:20:37,540
Oh my gosh, he's got a little bed.

4754
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,380
Wait, what are you?

4755
03:20:40,060 --> 03:20:40,580
Jowbert!

4756
03:20:40,860 --> 03:20:41,240
Uh oh.

4757
03:20:42,820 --> 03:20:44,740
I think this was a real person, you guys.

4758
03:20:46,280 --> 03:20:46,800
Necromancer!

4759
03:20:48,740 --> 03:20:50,260
He's got a dark shirt.

4760
03:20:50,960 --> 03:20:52,000
Wide pants.

4761
03:20:52,140 --> 03:20:52,760
Copper ring.

4762
03:20:52,900 --> 03:20:53,180
I'll take that.

4763
03:20:58,930 --> 03:21:00,210
What are you doing here?

4764
03:21:00,350 --> 03:21:01,970
You necromancer!

4765
03:21:02,270 --> 03:21:03,190
Are you...

4766
03:21:04,730 --> 03:21:05,730
Necromancer sack?

4767
03:21:05,730 --> 03:21:06,810
What you got in there?

4768
03:21:07,290 --> 03:21:09,010
Got some flesh and bones.

4769
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:10,270
Okay.

4770
03:21:15,050 --> 03:21:15,530
Uh...

4771
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:16,150
I'll take that.

4772
03:21:16,610 --> 03:21:17,150
And that.

4773
03:21:17,370 --> 03:21:17,730
And that.

4774
03:21:19,550 --> 03:21:21,570
Necromancy may be legal in...

4775
03:21:21,570 --> 03:21:21,930
Ca...

4776
03:21:22,410 --> 03:21:22,890
Ca...

4777
03:21:22,890 --> 03:21:23,130
Ca...

4778
03:21:23,130 --> 03:21:23,310
Ca...

4779
03:21:23,310 --> 03:21:23,550
Ca...

4780
03:21:23,550 --> 03:21:23,570
Ca...

4781
03:21:23,570 --> 03:21:23,690
Caр...

4782
03:21:23,690 --> 03:21:24,030
Caro-dil.

4783
03:21:24,190 --> 03:21:28,210
But few will openly admit to practicing it now that it's been banned by the mages' guild.

4784
03:21:29,690 --> 03:21:30,950
Oh, it's been banned.

4785
03:21:33,570 --> 03:21:34,210
Manual!

4786
03:21:34,550 --> 03:21:35,410
Wait, let's see.

4787
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:39,630
The beginning spellcaster.

4788
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:43,830
The most powerful mages in Tamriel were once beginners.

4789
03:21:44,150 --> 03:21:46,370
They all had similar early experiences.

4790
03:21:46,730 --> 03:21:49,510
Don't beat yourself up on the lockpicking minigame is rough.

4791
03:21:49,650 --> 03:21:50,150
No, it's okay.

4792
03:21:50,150 --> 03:21:52,370
I'm gonna become a pro.

4793
03:21:55,310 --> 03:21:56,670
I'm gonna become a pro.

4794
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:09,840
The mages guild of Tamriel have long been the first stop on a long road to knowledge and power for many individuals, providing magical services for the general public.

4795
03:22:10,220 --> 03:22:11,620
Oh, mucho texto.

4796
03:22:14,320 --> 03:22:15,240
Guild... oh.

4797
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:20,360
The guild offers a wide variety of spells for purchase and is recommended as a first stop for any...

4798
03:22:20,360 --> 03:22:22,300
I'm not gonna be a spellcaster though.

4799
03:22:26,610 --> 03:22:27,150
Maybe.

4800
03:22:28,750 --> 03:22:29,590
Probably not.

4801
03:22:29,590 --> 03:22:33,070
What if I decide I have a change of heart like mid...

4802
03:22:34,530 --> 03:22:35,410
Mid game.

4803
03:22:35,790 --> 03:22:39,190
And I just want to start chucking fireballs at everybody.

4804
03:22:40,290 --> 03:22:40,770
I do.

4805
03:22:40,950 --> 03:22:42,570
I should have thrown those fireballs before.

4806
03:22:43,090 --> 03:22:44,850
I should have gotten a taste of it.

4807
03:22:46,390 --> 03:22:47,010
You know?

4808
03:22:50,250 --> 03:22:51,230
You can do that.

4809
03:22:51,230 --> 03:22:51,750
You can.

4810
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:52,010
Man.

4811
03:22:52,450 --> 03:22:54,750
I'm not stuck to being an archer forever.

4812
03:22:57,450 --> 03:22:58,330
The sword.

4813
03:22:58,450 --> 03:22:59,670
Yeah, but it's a long sword.

4814
03:22:59,670 --> 03:23:00,930
I don't know if I want to take it.

4815
03:23:02,350 --> 03:23:03,370
This one right here.

4816
03:23:07,470 --> 03:23:08,190
You good?

4817
03:23:12,490 --> 03:23:13,950
I can always sell it.

4818
03:23:14,010 --> 03:23:14,650
But it's heavy.

4819
03:23:14,650 --> 03:23:14,830
Sorry.

4820
03:23:15,350 --> 03:23:17,310
I will be coming cumbered.

4821
03:23:18,770 --> 03:23:19,550
It's fine.

4822
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:24,970
Heart gate.

4823
03:23:26,070 --> 03:23:26,950
Wait a second.

4824
03:23:27,750 --> 03:23:29,050
I think I know this.

4825
03:23:29,550 --> 03:23:30,290
Oh gosh.

4826
03:23:34,640 --> 03:23:35,600
Can I...

4827
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:36,680
Okay, I can get out.

4828
03:23:37,080 --> 03:23:37,540
Okay, hold on.

4829
03:23:38,680 --> 03:23:40,360
Maybe we can find a key somewhere.

4830
03:23:40,980 --> 03:23:42,040
Does he have a key?

4831
03:23:42,540 --> 03:23:43,380
Do you have a key?

4832
03:23:44,020 --> 03:23:45,140
I didn't see a key.

4833
03:23:46,280 --> 03:23:46,760
No.

4834
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:49,160
There is a key.

4835
03:23:49,460 --> 03:23:50,540
Yeah, I just gotta find it.

4836
03:23:52,360 --> 03:23:52,840
Swear.

4837
03:23:53,500 --> 03:23:54,240
Swear it.

4838
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:59,280
I imagine it's like up there.

4839
03:23:59,420 --> 03:24:00,260
Wait, can I get up here?

4840
03:24:01,660 --> 03:24:02,400
Oh my gosh.

4841
03:24:02,420 --> 03:24:03,280
I'm a master jumper.

4842
03:24:03,440 --> 03:24:04,260
Of course I can.

4843
03:24:06,340 --> 03:24:06,820
Parkour.

4844
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:08,960
Jump.

4845
03:24:09,260 --> 03:24:10,040
For the key.

4846
03:24:10,480 --> 03:24:11,240
For the beef.

4847
03:24:11,240 --> 03:24:13,400
Where the hell am I?

4848
03:24:20,180 --> 03:24:21,480
Where does this go?

4849
03:24:23,380 --> 03:24:25,920
Stone door to...

4850
03:24:25,920 --> 03:24:27,460
Vilvorin.

4851
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:30,140
Is that...

4852
03:24:30,140 --> 03:24:32,520
Is Vilvorin another word for exit?

4853
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:40,880
Look.

4854
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:41,700
Wait a second.

4855
03:24:45,720 --> 03:24:47,340
Would this just...

4856
03:24:48,260 --> 03:24:49,460
Actually, I'm kinda confused.

4857
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:51,200
What the map is showing me.

4858
03:24:51,340 --> 03:24:53,360
It looks like it's just a loop, but...

4859
03:24:54,620 --> 03:24:55,400
That's not...

4860
03:24:55,400 --> 03:24:56,700
That's not the case, right?

4861
03:25:02,780 --> 03:25:04,260
This is the door I skipped?

4862
03:25:05,280 --> 03:25:06,020
No way.

4863
03:25:06,740 --> 03:25:07,620
Oh my gosh!

4864
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:08,380
It really is!

4865
03:25:08,640 --> 03:25:09,600
I thought...

4866
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:10,820
I thought it was...

4867
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:14,660
The area where like the...

4868
03:25:14,660 --> 03:25:16,080
The bandit leader was.

4869
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:16,720
That I...

4870
03:25:16,720 --> 03:25:17,360
That I killed.

4871
03:25:17,540 --> 03:25:18,480
With the two guys.

4872
03:25:18,520 --> 03:25:19,680
I thought it was that area.

4873
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:20,780
Oh my god.

4874
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:24,100
I was like, there's no way it's a loop.

4875
03:25:24,940 --> 03:25:26,640
It was indeed a loop.

4876
03:25:30,470 --> 03:25:31,730
Oh god.

4877
03:25:33,250 --> 03:25:33,890
Someday...

4878
03:25:33,890 --> 03:25:35,450
Someday we'll see the sun again.

4879
03:25:36,310 --> 03:25:36,690
I'm...

4880
03:25:36,690 --> 03:25:37,690
I'm doomed...

4881
03:25:37,690 --> 03:25:40,570
To a life of sewers and dungeons.

4882
03:25:45,410 --> 03:25:46,550
I don't think I need...

4883
03:25:46,550 --> 03:25:48,450
How many do I have on these potions anyway?

4884
03:25:49,130 --> 03:25:50,530
I think I have quite many.

4885
03:25:50,910 --> 03:25:51,050
No?

4886
03:25:59,220 --> 03:25:59,660
Oh!

4887
03:26:00,480 --> 03:26:01,820
This is the way out!

4888
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:02,640
Wait, what's this?

4889
03:26:03,140 --> 03:26:03,480
No.

4890
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:04,280
We went there.

4891
03:26:04,440 --> 03:26:05,160
We went everywhere.

4892
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:06,460
We've been everywhere!

4893
03:26:10,530 --> 03:26:11,530
We've been everywhere!

4894
03:26:12,130 --> 03:26:12,810
Oh my gosh.

4895
03:26:12,810 --> 03:26:13,310
Is it really?

4896
03:26:14,930 --> 03:26:15,970
Oh my god!

4897
03:26:16,210 --> 03:26:17,570
That's the trap I activated!

4898
03:26:17,910 --> 03:26:19,270
And I didn't realize...

4899
03:26:19,270 --> 03:26:19,910
Oh my gosh.

4900
03:26:20,130 --> 03:26:20,470
Oh.

4901
03:26:20,610 --> 03:26:21,770
And that's the guy I killed!

4902
03:26:21,950 --> 03:26:23,570
That thought he was a friend, but he wasn't!

4903
03:26:24,670 --> 03:26:25,230
Oh!

4904
03:26:26,070 --> 03:26:26,630
The

4905
03:26:31,450 --> 03:26:31,870
freeze!

4906
03:26:32,370 --> 03:26:32,870
Sweet freedom!

4907
03:26:39,390 --> 03:26:40,710
It's purple outside.

4908
03:26:44,440 --> 03:26:45,780
It's purple outside.

4909
03:26:46,380 --> 03:26:47,960
What the hell is that?

4910
03:26:49,300 --> 03:26:51,460
Is that one of them crabs we're talking about?

4911
03:26:54,800 --> 03:26:55,440
Dang.

4912
03:26:56,640 --> 03:26:58,340
It's further than I thought it was.

4913
03:27:03,350 --> 03:27:04,350
It's dinner.

4914
03:27:04,510 --> 03:27:05,250
That's what it is.

4915
03:27:07,430 --> 03:27:08,770
Crab on me!

4916
03:27:11,270 --> 03:27:12,250
Mud crab.

4917
03:27:12,770 --> 03:27:13,670
Are these delicious?

4918
03:27:14,630 --> 03:27:16,170
Why does it have a lockpick?

4919
03:27:18,650 --> 03:27:19,450
Dinner.

4920
03:27:19,790 --> 03:27:20,190
Ah!

4921
03:27:20,870 --> 03:27:22,130
Oh my god!

4922
03:27:22,390 --> 03:27:23,010
They're violent!

4923
03:27:25,790 --> 03:27:27,270
Where the hell did you come from?

4924
03:27:31,950 --> 03:27:32,790
Sneaky crab!

4925
03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:36,470
Oh my god!

4926
03:27:41,070 --> 03:27:42,070
Seeking your roots.

4927
03:27:42,290 --> 03:27:45,370
I've recovered a sprig of Nern root.

4928
03:27:45,370 --> 03:27:45,450
What?

4929
03:27:47,090 --> 03:27:48,810
I dropped my house keys back there.

4930
03:27:49,490 --> 03:27:49,690
Oh.

4931
03:27:50,050 --> 03:27:50,710
Good luck.

4932
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:51,710
Alright.

4933
03:27:51,870 --> 03:27:52,870
Good luck for you.

4934
03:27:53,390 --> 03:27:54,170
A plant ingredient.

4935
03:27:54,170 --> 03:27:55,810
This unusual must have value.

4936
03:27:56,350 --> 03:27:57,630
Bring it to a chemist.

4937
03:27:59,070 --> 03:27:59,230
Oh.

4938
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:05,280
Nern...

4939
03:28:05,280 --> 03:28:06,240
Nern...

4940
03:28:06,240 --> 03:28:07,140
Nern...

4941
03:28:07,140 --> 03:28:08,440
Nern root quest.

4942
03:28:08,980 --> 03:28:10,080
The nerd root.

4943
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,160
Before...

4944
03:28:15,160 --> 03:28:15,300
Oh!

4945
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:17,200
The sun is coming up.

4946
03:28:17,400 --> 03:28:18,600
It's a beautiful day.

4947
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:20,300
I've escaped the dungeons.

4948
03:28:21,800 --> 03:28:22,840
A horse!

4949
03:28:23,280 --> 03:28:23,620
Wait.

4950
03:28:23,880 --> 03:28:24,780
That horse has a...

4951
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:25,220
person.

4952
03:28:25,820 --> 03:28:27,600
But what if I won it instead?

4953
03:28:28,480 --> 03:28:28,920
Um...

4954
03:28:28,920 --> 03:28:29,520
Excuse me.

4955
03:28:30,060 --> 03:28:30,780
Just kidding.

4956
03:28:31,180 --> 03:28:31,460
Uh...

4957
03:28:31,460 --> 03:28:32,560
Can I have your horse?

4958
03:28:37,600 --> 03:28:38,640
Good evening.

4959
03:28:39,300 --> 03:28:39,820
Day?

4960
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:40,920
What day is it?

4961
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:42,260
Can you tell me what day it is?

4962
03:28:43,080 --> 03:28:43,760
Hello, sir.

4963
03:28:45,140 --> 03:28:46,440
Yeah, what day is it?

4964
03:28:46,860 --> 03:28:47,380
Rumors.

4965
03:28:47,380 --> 03:28:49,920
There's been some terrible trouble at the chapel in Anvil.

4966
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:54,200
All of the Bella's priests and priestesses murdered.

4967
03:28:55,660 --> 03:28:56,420
Murdered.

4968
03:28:57,040 --> 03:28:57,920
Carry on.

4969
03:28:58,320 --> 03:28:58,560
Okay.

4970
03:28:58,960 --> 03:29:00,180
Look at this horse.

4971
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:14,120
I'll become encumbered though, no?

4972
03:29:15,060 --> 03:29:15,880
Take his horse.

4973
03:29:16,100 --> 03:29:17,240
I kinda really want it.

4974
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:21,000
I hear some...

4975
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,180
Oh, I think I hear the little root shining.

4976
03:29:23,580 --> 03:29:24,300
I hear like a...

4977
03:29:24,740 --> 03:29:24,920
Bring!

4978
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:25,660
Bring!

4979
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,240
Take his pants!

4980
03:29:29,520 --> 03:29:30,240
What if I just...

4981
03:29:30,240 --> 03:29:31,220
Take my ear, sir, sir.

4982
03:29:31,480 --> 03:29:31,760
Oh.

4983
03:29:33,740 --> 03:29:35,280
I already asked you.

4984
03:29:37,080 --> 03:29:38,380
I'm ready...

4985
03:29:38,380 --> 03:29:39,680
I'm ready to...

4986
03:29:39,680 --> 03:29:40,460
Or...

4987
03:29:40,460 --> 03:29:40,620
Rather...

4988
03:29:40,620 --> 03:29:42,500
I'm not quite ready to...

4989
03:29:42,500 --> 03:29:45,020
Become such a nuisance to the world yet.

4990
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:47,240
But soon...

4991
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:49,320
Take his life.

4992
03:29:50,900 --> 03:29:53,240
You guys are so hungry for...

4993
03:29:55,760 --> 03:29:56,980
For blood.

4994
03:29:59,020 --> 03:30:00,160
I'm just here to explore...

4995
03:30:00,640 --> 03:30:01,480
Just a little bit.

4996
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:04,160
Before I then start taking lives.

4997
03:30:04,580 --> 03:30:04,780
You know?

4998
03:30:05,540 --> 03:30:06,700
Oh, there's another guy.

4999
03:30:08,040 --> 03:30:09,060
Chained in hall.

5000
03:30:10,360 --> 03:30:11,180
Hello, sir.

5001
03:30:11,900 --> 03:30:12,820
My athletics.

5002
03:30:13,240 --> 03:30:14,240
Level 27.

5003
03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:16,180
Yeah.

5004
03:30:16,760 --> 03:30:17,200
Talk to me.

5005
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:17,940
Talk to me.

5006
03:30:18,340 --> 03:30:18,940
Talk, talk, talk.

5007
03:30:22,420 --> 03:30:23,700
You got any rumors?

5008
03:30:23,960 --> 03:30:24,540
What's the tea?

5009
03:30:26,980 --> 03:30:27,560
Find divine.

5010
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:28,760
Stay on the roads.

5011
03:30:29,240 --> 03:30:31,460
The wilderness just isn't safe anymore.

5012
03:30:32,200 --> 03:30:33,720
We've had sightings, you see.

5013
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:35,340
The Daedra.

5014
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:38,460
The Daedra?

5015
03:30:39,540 --> 03:30:40,360
Move along.

5016
03:30:40,780 --> 03:30:41,020
Okay.

5017
03:30:41,300 --> 03:30:42,420
How do I put my fists away?

5018
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:43,780
I don't think I can, you guys.

5019
03:30:46,120 --> 03:30:47,160
YouTube is acting...

5020
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:47,640
Oh, YouTube!

5021
03:30:48,060 --> 03:30:48,680
Oh my gosh.

5022
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:49,560
It's been so bad.

5023
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:52,120
Anytime I watch people's streams lately, it's just...

5024
03:30:52,120 --> 03:30:53,680
It's always buffering.

5025
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:55,380
It's not great at all.

5026
03:30:55,380 --> 03:30:56,120
I'm so sorry.

5027
03:31:01,020 --> 03:31:02,060
Fort Eurosec.

5028
03:31:02,500 --> 03:31:03,700
Yeah, but like...

5029
03:31:09,040 --> 03:31:10,080
That guy...

5030
03:31:12,600 --> 03:31:13,120
Oops.

5031
03:31:16,680 --> 03:31:18,680
Oh, F to sheath your fists.

5032
03:31:18,840 --> 03:31:19,260
Oh, okay.

5033
03:31:19,820 --> 03:31:20,320
Thank you.

5034
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,220
Nice shot.

5035
03:31:26,220 --> 03:31:26,540
Hey.

5036
03:31:27,060 --> 03:31:28,380
I don't need your sass.

5037
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:33,600
It was a nice shot if I was trying to...

5038
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:34,260
Miss.

5039
03:31:36,420 --> 03:31:38,140
If I was trying to get...

5040
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:39,720
I was just trying to scare him.

5041
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:40,520
You know?

5042
03:31:40,660 --> 03:31:42,660
I was just trying to get right in between them.

5043
03:31:46,860 --> 03:31:48,840
I gotta go find a...

5044
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:50,780
A guy to...

5045
03:31:50,780 --> 03:31:52,260
Sell all my stuff to.

5046
03:31:52,700 --> 03:31:55,020
I think that should be our priority number one.

5047
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:04,100
Why...

5048
03:32:04,100 --> 03:32:05,540
Why is everything trying to kill me?

5049
03:32:06,400 --> 03:32:07,100
What are you?

5050
03:32:07,220 --> 03:32:08,460
Oh my god, there's rats out here too!

5051
03:32:10,400 --> 03:32:12,400
I thought it was like a possum or something.

5052
03:32:13,680 --> 03:32:15,360
Okay, I'm not putting my weapon away.

5053
03:32:15,960 --> 03:32:16,960
That was a bad idea.

5054
03:32:17,540 --> 03:32:20,180
He did just tell me not to go off the roads.

5055
03:32:20,180 --> 03:32:21,420
But...

5056
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:22,500
I...

5057
03:32:23,060 --> 03:32:23,860
Uh oh.

5058
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:24,840
Something's on fire.

5059
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:26,420
Oh, that's the campsite.

5060
03:32:30,560 --> 03:32:31,480
Rats are everywhere.

5061
03:32:32,500 --> 03:32:33,160
Nice.

5062
03:32:34,420 --> 03:32:34,960
Whee!

5063
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:38,360
Um...

5064
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:40,960
If I walk around with my bow and arrow out...

5065
03:32:40,960 --> 03:32:42,320
Will people get angry at me?

5066
03:32:43,040 --> 03:32:44,420
Will they be like...

5067
03:32:44,420 --> 03:32:44,920
Hey...

5068
03:32:44,920 --> 03:32:45,580
Hey buddy.

5069
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:47,320
Why are you so aggressive?

5070
03:32:47,720 --> 03:32:48,960
Why are you coming at me like that?

5071
03:32:49,880 --> 03:32:50,560
No?

5072
03:32:52,260 --> 03:32:53,740
Aw, the little deer!

5073
03:32:57,420 --> 03:32:59,200
Oh my god, so cute.

5074
03:33:01,180 --> 03:33:01,700
Bambi.

5075
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:05,440
Yes, sorta.

5076
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:07,780
Oh my god, not a freaking crab.

5077
03:33:09,060 --> 03:33:10,040
Stay away from me!

5078
03:33:10,400 --> 03:33:11,580
Stay away from me, crab!

5079
03:33:18,200 --> 03:33:19,240
Knock him over.

5080
03:33:23,380 --> 03:33:25,300
I was just coming to see what this was.

5081
03:33:26,140 --> 03:33:26,960
Looked fancy.

5082
03:33:31,310 --> 03:33:33,450
Way shrine stendar.

5083
03:33:34,390 --> 03:33:35,450
Protect the weak.

5084
03:33:35,610 --> 03:33:37,930
Pray at my chapel altars to receive my blessings.

5085
03:33:38,890 --> 03:33:39,350
Oh!

5086
03:33:39,690 --> 03:33:40,570
What did I get?

5087
03:33:43,900 --> 03:33:44,580
Oh!

5088
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:46,120
Oh, thank you!

5089
03:33:49,890 --> 03:33:50,810
A buff?

5090
03:33:51,250 --> 03:33:51,670
Let's go.

5091
03:33:56,020 --> 03:33:58,980
Imperial city is the walls and tower to the west.

5092
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:00,140
Uh...

5093
03:34:00,140 --> 03:34:00,940
This right there, right?

5094
03:34:02,260 --> 03:34:03,680
Yeah, I did notice it.

5095
03:34:04,280 --> 03:34:05,940
I think, uh...

5096
03:34:06,740 --> 03:34:08,080
Probably would be...

5097
03:34:08,080 --> 03:34:10,040
Best to just go there, huh?

5098
03:34:11,260 --> 03:34:12,420
Cause it's so close.

5099
03:34:16,570 --> 03:34:18,110
I'm gonna go back to the...

5100
03:34:19,730 --> 03:34:20,490
This thing.

5101
03:34:20,930 --> 03:34:21,370
And...

5102
03:34:21,370 --> 03:34:23,150
Oh wait, I swam across, didn't I?

5103
03:34:23,270 --> 03:34:23,990
We can swim here!

5104
03:34:25,810 --> 03:34:27,870
Why are the deer not doing anything?

5105
03:34:28,210 --> 03:34:29,750
They're kinda freaking me out.

5106
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:32,990
Oh, I hear a quest.

5107
03:34:33,610 --> 03:34:35,050
I hear a quest!

5108
03:34:36,110 --> 03:34:37,010
Is it you?

5109
03:34:41,050 --> 03:34:41,690
Oh!

5110
03:34:41,990 --> 03:34:43,250
It's the Nern Root!

5111
03:34:52,410 --> 03:34:53,090
Hahahaha!

5112
03:34:57,260 --> 03:34:59,200
They're very tranquil, you guys.

5113
03:35:01,220 --> 03:35:02,240
They're very...

5114
03:35:08,580 --> 03:35:10,860
Don't they just kind of put you at ease?

5115
03:35:12,240 --> 03:35:12,920
Oop!

5116
03:35:18,860 --> 03:35:19,580
Trick shot!

5117
03:35:19,720 --> 03:35:20,820
I'm not gonna shoot them!

5118
03:35:21,620 --> 03:35:23,500
I only shoot...

5119
03:35:23,500 --> 03:35:23,840
Oop!

5120
03:35:24,720 --> 03:35:26,220
I shoot to kill.

5121
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:28,300
And I'm not hungry right now.

5122
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:31,220
Yeah, so serene.

5123
03:35:31,520 --> 03:35:34,140
Until a damn mud crab comes at you.

5124
03:35:35,360 --> 03:35:36,240
Ooh, it's...

5125
03:35:36,240 --> 03:35:39,840
My game's lagging just a tad sometimes, but...

5126
03:35:40,720 --> 03:35:41,960
Who's attacking me?

5127
03:35:45,430 --> 03:35:46,290
Oh my god!

5128
03:35:46,450 --> 03:35:47,690
What the hell are you?!

5129
03:35:47,690 --> 03:35:48,370
Oh!

5130
03:35:50,830 --> 03:35:52,150
That's like a real enemy!

5131
03:35:53,790 --> 03:35:55,450
I thought it was a damn crab!

5132
03:35:56,410 --> 03:35:57,350
What the hell?!

5133
03:36:01,430 --> 03:36:02,230
Is there another?

5134
03:36:02,470 --> 03:36:02,670
Ah!

5135
03:36:03,630 --> 03:36:05,150
Oh my god, it was a crab!

5136
03:36:05,370 --> 03:36:06,710
Oh my god, there are crabs here too.

5137
03:36:07,790 --> 03:36:09,350
They were working together!

5138
03:36:09,670 --> 03:36:10,530
Oh my god!

5139
03:36:11,570 --> 03:36:12,630
Leave me alone!

5140
03:36:19,320 --> 03:36:21,120
It was an ambush!

5141
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:21,340
Push!

5142
03:36:22,840 --> 03:36:24,300
I'm on the path!

5143
03:36:24,520 --> 03:36:26,080
Everybody leave me alone!

5144
03:36:27,220 --> 03:36:28,240
I am...

5145
03:36:28,240 --> 03:36:30,360
I am but a weary traveler!

5146
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:32,840
I've gone through so much!

5147
03:36:35,240 --> 03:36:36,680
They hurt you!

5148
03:36:40,260 --> 03:36:42,920
Wow, this game really is pretty though!

5149
03:36:43,900 --> 03:36:44,220
Wow!

5150
03:36:52,490 --> 03:36:55,570
By nine divines, stay on the road!

5151
03:36:56,970 --> 03:36:57,850
Yes, officer!

5152
03:36:58,550 --> 03:37:01,210
I am an elf of the law!

5153
03:37:01,850 --> 03:37:03,650
An alien elf!

5154
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:09,170
I guess this counts as the road, huh?

5155
03:37:10,570 --> 03:37:10,930
Yeah.

5156
03:37:11,590 --> 03:37:12,870
Oh, I'm at the prison.

5157
03:37:13,190 --> 03:37:16,850
I mean... They won't, like, lock me back up, will they?

5158
03:37:20,450 --> 03:37:23,310
Will they be like... Hey, we remember you.

5159
03:37:23,630 --> 03:37:24,810
Back to the cell.

5160
03:37:26,750 --> 03:37:27,710
Just visiting.

5161
03:37:28,350 --> 03:37:30,210
I like how it's the Oblivion logo.

5162
03:37:31,650 --> 03:37:33,190
They can and will!

5163
03:37:33,590 --> 03:37:33,790
No!

5164
03:37:34,390 --> 03:37:35,190
I've done no!

5165
03:37:35,370 --> 03:37:36,690
I'm... I'm E-Tina!

5166
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:37,630
I'm literally... Oh.

5167
03:37:38,610 --> 03:37:40,710
I'm a local celeb at this point.

5168
03:37:40,790 --> 03:37:42,150
Can you spare a coin?

5169
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:45,330
Oh.

5170
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:47,230
I'm lagging again.

5171
03:37:51,860 --> 03:37:53,320
Hold on.

5172
03:37:55,240 --> 03:37:56,240
Hold on.

5173
03:37:57,200 --> 03:37:57,580
Oof.

5174
03:37:59,620 --> 03:38:00,600
Let's see.

5175
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:13,600
Yeah, I might change the resolution.

5176
03:38:14,260 --> 03:38:16,740
Other... But it's, like, it's so small for me, otherwise.

5177
03:38:18,180 --> 03:38:19,160
V-Sync on?

5178
03:38:19,300 --> 03:38:20,140
Oh, you can try it.

5179
03:38:32,070 --> 03:38:33,070
I think that works.

5180
03:38:35,070 --> 03:38:35,510
Actually.

5181
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:40,410
Code of 480p.

5182
03:38:40,790 --> 03:38:41,210
Yeah, baby.

5183
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:42,610
Put a frame limit.

5184
03:38:42,750 --> 03:38:43,590
I already did that.

5185
03:38:43,750 --> 03:38:44,210
Thank you, though.

5186
03:38:46,810 --> 03:38:47,490
E-T!

5187
03:38:47,490 --> 03:38:51,930
One man's trash soon becomes another man's trash, I suppose.

5188
03:38:52,030 --> 03:38:52,210
Hello.

5189
03:38:55,130 --> 03:38:55,650
Uh...

5190
03:38:55,650 --> 03:38:56,350
Rumors?

5191
03:38:56,550 --> 03:38:58,910
There's been some terrible trouble at the chapel in Anvil.

5192
03:38:59,130 --> 03:39:03,190
All of the Bella's priests and priestesses murdered.

5193
03:39:04,010 --> 03:39:04,530
Murdered.

5194
03:39:05,970 --> 03:39:06,490
Murdered.

5195
03:39:06,810 --> 03:39:07,490
Oh, wait.

5196
03:39:07,650 --> 03:39:08,830
I forgot to... Also, there we go.

5197
03:39:10,470 --> 03:39:10,990
Noise.

5198
03:39:11,510 --> 03:39:12,810
Stop right there, criminal maid.

5199
03:39:12,990 --> 03:39:14,450
Nobody breaks the law on my watch.

5200
03:39:14,890 --> 03:39:16,350
I'm taking your stolen goods.

5201
03:39:16,490 --> 03:39:18,450
Now pay the fine or it's off to jail with you.

5202
03:39:18,970 --> 03:39:19,970
No, you can't.

5203
03:39:20,070 --> 03:39:20,970
What are you looking for?

5204
03:39:21,150 --> 03:39:21,730
You can't.

5205
03:39:21,730 --> 03:39:22,670
You can't rest me.

5206
03:39:23,130 --> 03:39:25,050
I'm already... I already quit.

5207
03:39:25,490 --> 03:39:26,630
Where can I sleep?

5208
03:39:26,790 --> 03:39:28,270
Merchants Inn in the market.

5209
03:39:28,550 --> 03:39:30,150
King and Queen in Elven Gardens.

5210
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:32,910
The Tiber Septim in Talos Plaza.

5211
03:39:33,210 --> 03:39:35,950
And All Saints in Temple District.

5212
03:39:36,910 --> 03:39:40,730
There's also the bloated float on the waterfront, but...

5213
03:39:40,730 --> 03:39:41,710
Okay.

5214
03:39:42,010 --> 03:39:42,770
Farewell, citizen.

5215
03:39:43,010 --> 03:39:44,210
I've heard others say the same.

5216
03:39:44,450 --> 03:39:45,290
Goodbye.

5217
03:39:45,610 --> 03:39:46,630
Take care.

5218
03:39:47,010 --> 03:39:48,250
Spare a coin.

5219
03:39:48,590 --> 03:39:49,830
For the infirm.

5220
03:39:50,110 --> 03:39:51,530
Are you okay, ma'am?

5221
03:39:52,730 --> 03:39:53,690
Oh, gosh.

5222
03:39:54,190 --> 03:39:55,330
She looks worse than me.

5223
03:39:57,670 --> 03:39:58,950
What is it, citizen?

5224
03:39:59,450 --> 03:40:00,550
I'm walking here.

5225
03:40:00,670 --> 03:40:00,910
Oh, wait.

5226
03:40:00,950 --> 03:40:01,330
Who's this?

5227
03:40:08,210 --> 03:40:09,230
Shut up.

5228
03:40:10,930 --> 03:40:11,990
Shut up.

5229
03:40:13,070 --> 03:40:15,190
His name is Gray Fox?

5230
03:40:16,750 --> 03:40:22,370
Wanted for theft, embezzlement, forgery, pit-pocketing, grand

5231
03:40:28,640 --> 03:40:33,780
larceny, tax evasion, slander fraud, perfidy, and impertinence.

5232
03:40:37,290 --> 03:40:37,950
No.

5233
03:40:38,290 --> 03:40:38,770
No.

5234
03:40:38,770 --> 03:40:39,130
It can't be.

5235
03:40:39,210 --> 03:40:41,550
I killed that guy in Zanzibar land.

5236
03:40:41,850 --> 03:40:42,330
No.

5237
03:40:46,910 --> 03:40:49,530
He got isekai'd after he...

5238
03:40:49,530 --> 03:40:51,270
After he died.

5239
03:40:52,270 --> 03:40:54,730
Wears a gray cloak that conceals his appearance.

5240
03:40:54,890 --> 03:40:56,950
Presumed male and colovian.

5241
03:40:57,330 --> 03:40:58,790
Height between five and six feet.

5242
03:40:58,790 --> 03:41:02,830
That's, like, really a big difference.

5243
03:41:03,890 --> 03:41:05,770
You must be that ninja.

5244
03:41:07,190 --> 03:41:09,910
Normal weight, hair and eye color unknown.

5245
03:41:10,310 --> 03:41:13,810
Any citizen with information should contact the Imperial Watch.

5246
03:41:15,750 --> 03:41:17,110
That's so funny.

5247
03:41:17,610 --> 03:41:18,290
Oh, my gosh.

5248
03:41:18,290 --> 03:41:18,950
What is it, citizen?

5249
03:41:18,950 --> 03:41:19,990
I know that guy.

5250
03:41:22,410 --> 03:41:23,210
Oh, my gosh.

5251
03:41:23,310 --> 03:41:23,770
A jester.

5252
03:41:24,410 --> 03:41:25,170
Dance for me.

5253
03:41:26,950 --> 03:41:30,190
I'm Gemilus Axios, Earl Jackman's manservant.

5254
03:41:30,210 --> 03:41:31,190
Oh, he's a manservant.

5255
03:41:31,270 --> 03:41:32,990
He did not inform me of your visit.

5256
03:41:33,350 --> 03:41:34,090
Oh, who?

5257
03:41:34,530 --> 03:41:35,310
Gray Fox.

5258
03:41:35,790 --> 03:41:35,890
Oh.

5259
03:41:36,550 --> 03:41:38,070
He's that wanted criminal.

5260
03:41:38,630 --> 03:41:40,130
Isn't he a master thief?

5261
03:41:40,410 --> 03:41:42,070
I hear he's dangerous, too.

5262
03:41:42,590 --> 03:41:44,490
I've heard that the beggars spy for him.

5263
03:41:45,350 --> 03:41:47,250
He looks really excited about it.

5264
03:41:47,350 --> 03:41:47,750
Who are you?

5265
03:41:47,750 --> 03:41:52,570
He's that Imperial Watch Captain that's always chasing after the Gray Fox in the Thieves' Guild.

5266
03:41:52,970 --> 03:41:55,250
Chasing after shadows, if you ask me.

5267
03:41:55,590 --> 03:41:58,230
The Thieves' Guild probably doesn't exist.

5268
03:41:58,490 --> 03:42:00,750
And it's a sure bet that Gray Fox doesn't either.

5269
03:42:00,950 --> 03:42:01,190
Oh?

5270
03:42:02,210 --> 03:42:03,990
This guy is probably Gray Fox.

5271
03:42:04,230 --> 03:42:05,110
How much do you want to bet?

5272
03:42:06,890 --> 03:42:07,550
Uh-oh.

5273
03:42:09,810 --> 03:42:12,310
Guys, the game is, like, breaking my computer.

5274
03:42:14,670 --> 03:42:15,190
Oh.

5275
03:42:15,190 --> 03:42:18,650
My wallpapers are turning on and off.

5276
03:42:18,810 --> 03:42:20,490
Here, I'm going to turn off wallpaper engine real quick.

5277
03:42:22,630 --> 03:42:23,210
Pause.

5278
03:42:24,270 --> 03:42:25,310
I should do it.

5279
03:42:27,110 --> 03:42:27,690
Normal.

5280
03:42:27,910 --> 03:42:28,630
Normal behavior.

5281
03:42:29,790 --> 03:42:29,970
Yeah.

5282
03:42:30,770 --> 03:42:31,030
Okay.

5283
03:42:31,490 --> 03:42:32,130
Imperial City.

5284
03:42:32,410 --> 03:42:35,050
The Isle is perhaps not well known in the city.

5285
03:42:35,290 --> 03:42:38,290
He is a private man and keeps to himself.

5286
03:42:40,330 --> 03:42:45,990
Both Thiel from the Arcane University is looking for someone to chase the bandits from Camp Ailes.

5287
03:42:46,470 --> 03:42:49,190
Probably trying to enhance her weird machine.

5288
03:42:49,770 --> 03:42:50,110
Yeah.

5289
03:42:50,490 --> 03:42:51,290
She's weird, huh?

5290
03:42:51,870 --> 03:42:52,430
Persuading.

5291
03:42:52,550 --> 03:42:53,670
What can I persuade you to do?

5292
03:42:53,950 --> 03:42:54,110
Oh.

5293
03:42:54,850 --> 03:42:58,390
In each attempt to persuade, you must admire both's joke and coerce.

5294
03:42:58,550 --> 03:43:01,430
Each of these actions raises or lowers the character's disposition.

5295
03:43:01,750 --> 03:43:04,930
Do not take too long because the character's disposition is steadily falling.

5296
03:43:05,630 --> 03:43:06,190
Oh.

5297
03:43:07,390 --> 03:43:07,910
Okay.

5298
03:43:08,310 --> 03:43:09,210
It's a dating sim?

5299
03:43:09,890 --> 03:43:14,090
When you hover each possible action, the character's face shows their reaction to it.

5300
03:43:14,330 --> 03:43:16,970
It can be love, like, dislike, or hate.

5301
03:43:17,170 --> 03:43:20,370
Their disposition increases if you select a loved or liked action.

5302
03:43:20,470 --> 03:43:20,650
Okay.

5303
03:43:21,170 --> 03:43:21,330
Oh.

5304
03:43:21,630 --> 03:43:21,950
Oh.

5305
03:43:23,050 --> 03:43:29,030
The potential gain or loss for each action is based on your speech craft and how full the wedges.

5306
03:43:29,270 --> 03:43:33,210
Try to select fuller wedges when they are aligned with actions the person likes.

5307
03:43:33,670 --> 03:43:34,010
All right.

5308
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:35,290
Oh.

5309
03:43:36,410 --> 03:43:37,850
I can just bribe them?

5310
03:43:39,870 --> 03:43:41,090
I don't even know.

5311
03:43:41,330 --> 03:43:42,890
I just want to try it.

5312
03:43:44,010 --> 03:43:44,510
I'm going to...

5313
03:43:48,340 --> 03:43:48,920
No.

5314
03:43:49,320 --> 03:43:51,060
You do me too much honor.

5315
03:43:53,820 --> 03:43:54,400
Yeah.

5316
03:43:54,680 --> 03:43:55,480
I get it.

5317
03:43:58,860 --> 03:44:00,540
He doesn't like these other ones.

5318
03:44:00,880 --> 03:44:01,340
Admire.

5319
03:44:01,880 --> 03:44:02,440
Wait.

5320
03:44:02,500 --> 03:44:03,180
I can't do these.

5321
03:44:06,920 --> 03:44:07,440
What?

5322
03:44:07,660 --> 03:44:08,700
How do I tell...

5323
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:12,740
You can't scare me.

5324
03:44:12,980 --> 03:44:14,500
I can't scare me.

5325
03:44:14,940 --> 03:44:15,740
You have to do all four.

5326
03:44:15,880 --> 03:44:16,040
Oh.

5327
03:44:16,040 --> 03:44:16,840
You're pathetic.

5328
03:44:17,240 --> 03:44:17,940
Oh my god.

5329
03:44:17,940 --> 03:44:19,360
He said it with a smile.

5330
03:44:22,060 --> 03:44:22,580
Okay.

5331
03:44:24,160 --> 03:44:26,100
What a waste of time.

5332
03:44:28,960 --> 03:44:29,980
How are you today?

5333
03:44:30,860 --> 03:44:31,620
Oh god.

5334
03:44:31,700 --> 03:44:32,420
Hello.

5335
03:44:36,280 --> 03:44:37,000
Yeah?

5336
03:44:38,120 --> 03:44:38,840
What?

5337
03:44:39,220 --> 03:44:40,740
Are you in love with me or something?

5338
03:44:41,240 --> 03:44:42,380
Love at first sight?

5339
03:44:42,380 --> 03:44:43,660
Good morning.

5340
03:44:43,860 --> 03:44:44,980
Good morning.

5341
03:44:46,460 --> 03:44:48,560
The copious coin purse.

5342
03:44:48,700 --> 03:44:49,500
Can I sell things here?

5343
03:44:51,880 --> 03:44:54,140
He definitely is a gray fox.

5344
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:00,820
The shop where your purse is just as full after you buy.

5345
03:45:01,160 --> 03:45:02,220
What does that mean?

5346
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:04,720
Welcome to the copious coin purse.

5347
03:45:05,800 --> 03:45:08,400
What kind of deal could I make for you today?

5348
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:09,420
Oh.

5349
03:45:09,760 --> 03:45:10,440
Gray fox.

5350
03:45:10,720 --> 03:45:11,920
Blasted thief.

5351
03:45:11,920 --> 03:45:14,220
I hope they string him up when they catch him.

5352
03:45:14,420 --> 03:45:15,700
He's a slippery one though.

5353
03:45:16,140 --> 03:45:17,760
The beggars are his eyes and ears.

5354
03:45:18,700 --> 03:45:19,080
Um.

5355
03:45:21,380 --> 03:45:22,420
So bartering...

5356
03:45:22,420 --> 03:45:23,160
Goodbye.

5357
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:24,320
Please come again.

5358
03:45:24,520 --> 03:45:25,000
Thanks.

5359
03:45:25,220 --> 03:45:25,400
Oh.

5360
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:26,620
I could steal these pumpkins.

5361
03:45:27,520 --> 03:45:29,220
I could steal anything in here.

5362
03:45:29,740 --> 03:45:31,280
I am the gray fox.

5363
03:45:31,940 --> 03:45:32,720
It's me.

5364
03:45:33,060 --> 03:45:33,440
Oh.

5365
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:35,240
I could go in there.

5366
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:38,060
How...

5367
03:45:39,020 --> 03:45:40,680
I can't even read...

5368
03:45:40,680 --> 03:45:42,060
A recipe.

5369
03:45:42,320 --> 03:45:43,960
I can't even read on your desk.

5370
03:45:44,360 --> 03:45:46,640
Welcome to the copious coin purse.

5371
03:45:46,880 --> 03:45:48,220
Why are you so stingy, huh?

5372
03:45:49,260 --> 03:45:50,280
Very easy.

5373
03:45:54,700 --> 03:45:55,300
Okay.

5374
03:45:56,640 --> 03:45:58,000
Bartering equals shop.

5375
03:45:58,340 --> 03:45:58,600
Okay.

5376
03:46:00,460 --> 03:46:01,860
You can read the books.

5377
03:46:01,960 --> 03:46:02,720
Just don't take them.

5378
03:46:02,960 --> 03:46:03,260
Okay.

5379
03:46:04,660 --> 03:46:05,720
First edition.

5380
03:46:06,120 --> 03:46:06,940
Oh, it's a bookstore?

5381
03:46:09,040 --> 03:46:09,640
Speed.

5382
03:46:10,160 --> 03:46:11,500
I don't want to say.

5383
03:46:14,100 --> 03:46:15,600
Oh, it's a sky again.

5384
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:17,840
Yulam Athram.

5385
03:46:18,060 --> 03:46:19,720
Or the Cragenmore Athrams.

5386
03:46:19,960 --> 03:46:21,860
Made my fortune in the Flynn trade.

5387
03:46:22,420 --> 03:46:23,520
And now I'm here in the city.

5388
03:46:23,780 --> 03:46:25,160
Living the life of ease.

5389
03:46:27,900 --> 03:46:28,460
Rumors?

5390
03:46:28,760 --> 03:46:31,780
The chestnut handy stables now offers to protect your horse.

5391
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:34,280
Seems handy enough.

5392
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:35,220
That's a rumor?

5393
03:46:35,640 --> 03:46:37,160
It's not juicy at all.

5394
03:46:37,740 --> 03:46:40,240
It's not juicy at all.

5395
03:46:40,740 --> 03:46:41,860
I could take some.

5396
03:46:43,160 --> 03:46:44,220
Is anyone in there?

5397
03:46:44,940 --> 03:46:46,340
Whose bed is this?

5398
03:46:46,880 --> 03:46:48,240
Why can't I sleep?

5399
03:46:50,600 --> 03:46:52,200
The hydrangea is so pretty.

5400
03:46:55,180 --> 03:46:55,880
Good day.

5401
03:46:56,320 --> 03:46:56,560
Good day.

5402
03:46:57,560 --> 03:46:58,300
Let's see.

5403
03:46:58,480 --> 03:47:01,260
We need to go this way.

5404
03:47:01,720 --> 03:47:02,900
I guess over that way.

5405
03:47:03,260 --> 03:47:06,460
What is it now?

5406
03:47:08,140 --> 03:47:10,060
Why are you so rude?

5407
03:47:10,540 --> 03:47:11,620
Are you talking to me?

5408
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:15,420
You talking to me?

5409
03:47:15,720 --> 03:47:16,240
How do you do?

5410
03:47:17,580 --> 03:47:19,180
I'm just exploring a little bit, guys.

5411
03:47:19,340 --> 03:47:20,320
Before I...

5412
03:47:20,320 --> 03:47:22,120
We're all talking about the Emperor's murder.

5413
03:47:22,180 --> 03:47:23,500
Discount spells.

5414
03:47:25,020 --> 03:47:26,220
Divine elegance.

5415
03:47:27,060 --> 03:47:27,660
Elegance?

5416
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:28,260
Whoa!

5417
03:47:29,220 --> 03:47:30,060
The arena.

5418
03:47:34,190 --> 03:47:35,470
Take your time.

5419
03:47:35,830 --> 03:47:36,910
Oh, Gray Fox.

5420
03:47:39,090 --> 03:47:40,310
What's this place?

5421
03:47:42,730 --> 03:47:44,010
North Watch Tower.

5422
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:51,320
Where would be a good place to sell my stuff, you guys?

5423
03:47:51,440 --> 03:47:52,180
What is it now?

5424
03:47:52,420 --> 03:47:54,160
I have not talked to you at all.

5425
03:47:54,380 --> 03:47:54,960
So I'm freaky.

5426
03:47:56,380 --> 03:47:56,980
Good news.

5427
03:47:57,420 --> 03:47:58,300
Everybody's so rude.

5428
03:48:00,400 --> 03:48:01,620
Can I go swimming in here?

5429
03:48:01,940 --> 03:48:03,740
Is anybody going to judge me for that, too?

5430
03:48:05,040 --> 03:48:07,000
An alien can't swim anymore?

5431
03:48:08,340 --> 03:48:11,940
An alien can't go fishing in the city's waters?

5432
03:48:13,960 --> 03:48:15,220
Any shop we'll buy?

5433
03:48:15,420 --> 03:48:15,920
Oh, okay.

5434
03:48:16,080 --> 03:48:16,220
Cool.

5435
03:48:19,060 --> 03:48:20,180
Then let's...

5436
03:48:20,840 --> 03:48:21,400
Sell.

5437
03:48:21,720 --> 03:48:22,500
I'm listening.

5438
03:48:22,820 --> 03:48:23,220
Go ahead.

5439
03:48:23,400 --> 03:48:25,020
The copious coin purse will buy anything?

5440
03:48:25,260 --> 03:48:25,400
Okay.

5441
03:48:26,300 --> 03:48:27,180
Let's buy...

5442
03:48:27,180 --> 03:48:27,660
Let's sell.

5443
03:48:29,520 --> 03:48:30,860
Let's sell, baby.

5444
03:48:34,700 --> 03:48:36,300
He sounds familiar.

5445
03:48:37,320 --> 03:48:38,860
Like his voice actor.

5446
03:48:40,020 --> 03:48:40,980
R to haggle.

5447
03:48:42,200 --> 03:48:43,240
Have a look around.

5448
03:48:43,720 --> 03:48:45,280
You won't find better prices in all town.

5449
03:48:45,280 --> 03:48:46,200
R to haggle.

5450
03:48:46,500 --> 03:48:46,820
Yeah.

5451
03:48:47,640 --> 03:48:48,080
All right.

5452
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:50,520
I'm just going to sell these bear pelts.

5453
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:54,080
For $2.65 gold?

5454
03:48:54,660 --> 03:48:54,980
Sure.

5455
03:48:56,180 --> 03:48:56,700
Wait, wait.

5456
03:48:56,800 --> 03:48:57,680
What do you mean I don't have enough?

5457
03:48:57,780 --> 03:48:58,620
Oh, that's not...

5458
03:48:58,620 --> 03:48:59,880
Oh, I didn't want to buy.

5459
03:49:00,620 --> 03:49:01,500
Oh, good thing.

5460
03:49:01,620 --> 03:49:02,120
Oh, my gosh.

5461
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:03,360
I'm buying.

5462
03:49:05,160 --> 03:49:07,760
I was going to say, I thought I got rid of the bear pelts before.

5463
03:49:13,140 --> 03:49:13,680
Let's see.

5464
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:18,240
Didn't it say it was worth more?

5465
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:23,320
In the dungeon?

5466
03:49:30,330 --> 03:49:31,650
Didn't it say...

5467
03:49:31,650 --> 03:49:32,490
$4.33?

5468
03:49:32,690 --> 03:49:33,550
This was worth...

5469
03:49:38,710 --> 03:49:40,050
The bottom right.

5470
03:49:40,970 --> 03:49:43,570
Yeah, but like...

5471
03:49:43,570 --> 03:49:44,550
Haggle.

5472
03:49:44,910 --> 03:49:45,050
Oh.

5473
03:49:45,470 --> 03:49:47,550
Buying items at 174% of value.

5474
03:49:48,250 --> 03:49:50,530
Selling items at 43%.

5475
03:49:50,530 --> 03:49:50,750
Wait.

5476
03:49:53,330 --> 03:49:55,930
I want to sell items at the full value.

5477
03:49:58,990 --> 03:50:00,850
Why can't I sell at the full value?

5478
03:50:01,530 --> 03:50:02,650
Make him like you?

5479
03:50:04,390 --> 03:50:05,590
I'm going to try it.

5480
03:50:06,130 --> 03:50:07,230
There's no harm, right?

5481
03:50:08,290 --> 03:50:09,030
Wait, did it work?

5482
03:50:12,820 --> 03:50:13,920
Where'd my stuff go?

5483
03:50:22,480 --> 03:50:23,360
Oh, $800.

5484
03:50:27,840 --> 03:50:28,720
That's still...

5485
03:50:28,720 --> 03:50:30,040
Try to sell?

5486
03:50:30,300 --> 03:50:32,000
Should I try to sell the Varla stone?

5487
03:50:32,140 --> 03:50:33,220
Or should I sell it some...

5488
03:50:33,220 --> 03:50:34,360
Here, I'll try to sell one of these.

5489
03:50:38,930 --> 03:50:40,310
I can't make that deal.

5490
03:50:41,310 --> 03:50:41,750
Oh!

5491
03:50:42,070 --> 03:50:42,510
Rude!

5492
03:50:42,750 --> 03:50:43,190
Rude!

5493
03:50:43,390 --> 03:50:44,070
I will take...

5494
03:50:44,070 --> 03:50:44,810
You're a satisfied customer.

5495
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:45,170
No!

5496
03:50:45,410 --> 03:50:46,130
Actually not!

5497
03:50:46,330 --> 03:50:46,950
I will take...

5498
03:50:46,950 --> 03:50:48,550
I will take my business elsewhere.

5499
03:50:51,350 --> 03:50:52,990
He only has 800 gold?

5500
03:50:53,230 --> 03:50:54,370
He owns a store!

5501
03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:55,850
Greetings, Imperium.

5502
03:50:56,310 --> 03:50:58,670
Ever bought enchanting supplies with you?

5503
03:50:59,310 --> 03:51:01,630
I'm syndicates of wizards have led a force on...

5504
03:51:01,630 --> 03:51:04,250
Everybody needs a copy of the Black Horse Courier!

5505
03:51:04,890 --> 03:51:06,070
The ultimate have power...

5506
03:51:06,070 --> 03:51:06,650
Not me.

5507
03:51:07,470 --> 03:51:09,410
It could be a dangerous...

5508
03:51:09,410 --> 03:51:10,710
An hourglass.

5509
03:51:11,110 --> 03:51:12,130
And some shoes.

5510
03:51:12,930 --> 03:51:13,610
It's a good day.

5511
03:51:14,310 --> 03:51:16,350
I gotta increase my favorability, clearly.

5512
03:51:16,350 --> 03:51:17,750
These are...

5513
03:51:17,750 --> 03:51:18,990
These are meant for stealing, right?

5514
03:51:19,210 --> 03:51:19,810
This is the...

5515
03:51:19,810 --> 03:51:21,090
This is the communal...

5516
03:51:21,090 --> 03:51:21,710
Sack?

5517
03:51:22,270 --> 03:51:23,270
Right, everybody?

5518
03:51:26,230 --> 03:51:26,750
Jewelry!

5519
03:51:26,930 --> 03:51:29,350
Maybe this guy will...

5520
03:51:36,410 --> 03:51:36,930
Whoa!

5521
03:51:38,190 --> 03:51:40,210
Oh, I could just take it if I wanted to.

5522
03:51:41,650 --> 03:51:43,470
I could take it from you.

5523
03:51:44,390 --> 03:51:44,910
Fabio.

5524
03:51:45,870 --> 03:51:46,970
But I won't.

5525
03:51:46,970 --> 03:51:49,470
Because I'm generous today.

5526
03:51:49,730 --> 03:51:52,250
And I'm just trying to figure out how to play this game.

5527
03:51:52,730 --> 03:51:56,230
So I'm not causing any trouble right now.

5528
03:51:57,690 --> 03:51:58,650
For now.

5529
03:51:59,410 --> 03:52:00,910
Why don't you even greet me, huh?

5530
03:52:01,870 --> 03:52:02,330
Yes?

5531
03:52:02,730 --> 03:52:04,150
It does look like Tommy Wiseau.

5532
03:52:04,430 --> 03:52:04,990
It does!

5533
03:52:06,170 --> 03:52:09,150
If you need money fast, try Gensine's.

5534
03:52:09,410 --> 03:52:11,290
You can sell almost anything there.

5535
03:52:11,390 --> 03:52:12,330
Who's Gensine?

5536
03:52:14,870 --> 03:52:16,730
What can I interest you in?

5537
03:52:16,950 --> 03:52:18,290
Oh, he also has 800.

5538
03:52:20,190 --> 03:52:22,090
Now I have...

5539
03:52:22,670 --> 03:52:23,870
These stones.

5540
03:52:24,690 --> 03:52:26,610
They're very rare.

5541
03:52:28,730 --> 03:52:29,840
And very...

5542
03:52:30,210 --> 03:52:31,010
Good.

5543
03:52:32,090 --> 03:52:34,150
And I would like to sell them.

5544
03:52:34,810 --> 03:52:35,550
For...

5545
03:52:35,550 --> 03:52:36,270
Um...

5546
03:52:36,270 --> 03:52:36,970
All of them.

5547
03:52:38,170 --> 03:52:39,130
For 695.

5548
03:52:43,180 --> 03:52:43,960
Wait a second.

5549
03:52:45,240 --> 03:52:45,720
Yeah.

5550
03:52:46,120 --> 03:52:46,540
That's...

5551
03:52:46,540 --> 03:52:46,660
Yeah.

5552
03:52:50,980 --> 03:52:52,020
It's a lot of gold.

5553
03:52:52,280 --> 03:52:52,760
Yeah?

5554
03:52:53,320 --> 03:52:55,460
You'll never be able to haggle to 80% like that.

5555
03:52:55,560 --> 03:52:56,200
Yes, I will.

5556
03:52:57,120 --> 03:52:58,400
You just don't believe.

5557
03:53:00,320 --> 03:53:01,460
You need those requests?

5558
03:53:01,720 --> 03:53:01,780
Oh.

5559
03:53:03,840 --> 03:53:04,800
Never mind, sir.

5560
03:53:05,780 --> 03:53:06,520
Be seeing you.

5561
03:53:07,860 --> 03:53:09,220
What should I sell, then?

5562
03:53:10,940 --> 03:53:12,040
What should I sell?

5563
03:53:15,820 --> 03:53:16,680
What do I...

5564
03:53:16,680 --> 03:53:16,980
What do I...

5565
03:53:16,980 --> 03:53:18,340
I gotta get rid of stuff, you guys.

5566
03:53:19,140 --> 03:53:20,220
I have too many things.

5567
03:53:23,540 --> 03:53:24,880
My potions of charisma.

5568
03:53:25,300 --> 03:53:27,080
Everybody needs a copy of the Black Horse Courier.

5569
03:53:27,080 --> 03:53:28,740
The feed bag.

5570
03:53:31,080 --> 03:53:31,600
Alright.

5571
03:53:31,780 --> 03:53:33,380
For now, let's just continue the...

5572
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:36,980
The main ingredient.

5573
03:53:37,260 --> 03:53:38,640
For now, I'll just continue the quest.

5574
03:53:39,860 --> 03:53:41,100
The main story.

5575
03:53:44,400 --> 03:53:45,200
In here?

5576
03:53:51,330 --> 03:53:51,850
Wait.

5577
03:53:51,970 --> 03:53:53,490
I only need one for a quest.

5578
03:53:54,650 --> 03:53:55,730
What's your story?

5579
03:53:55,990 --> 03:53:57,870
Gosh, you guys are so good at one-guying me.

5580
03:53:59,070 --> 03:54:00,190
I'm telling you.

5581
03:54:00,350 --> 03:54:00,850
If you...

5582
03:54:00,850 --> 03:54:03,150
If you tell me something, I'm gonna believe it.

5583
03:54:03,190 --> 03:54:04,770
I've never played this game before.

5584
03:54:04,770 --> 03:54:05,970
There's so much.

5585
03:54:08,930 --> 03:54:10,450
I'll just believe it.

5586
03:54:10,550 --> 03:54:10,830
Hey.

5587
03:54:11,210 --> 03:54:12,130
Greetings to you.

5588
03:54:12,290 --> 03:54:12,990
I know you.

5589
03:54:15,570 --> 03:54:18,270
You should really just sell things at bad prices.

5590
03:54:19,450 --> 03:54:21,390
Versus the alternative of dropping them later.

5591
03:54:21,390 --> 03:54:23,610
For the Imperial Palace by keeping your voice down.

5592
03:54:24,050 --> 03:54:25,250
I'm not speaking.

5593
03:54:25,730 --> 03:54:27,890
You're the one yelling at me from across the way.

5594
03:54:28,150 --> 03:54:29,050
You've got my ear.

5595
03:54:29,250 --> 03:54:29,830
Let's hear it.

5596
03:54:29,930 --> 03:54:30,710
What do you want to say?

5597
03:54:30,970 --> 03:54:31,350
I'm Jer.

5598
03:54:31,930 --> 03:54:32,730
I'm a dip.

5599
03:54:33,190 --> 03:54:34,270
A pickpocket.

5600
03:54:34,510 --> 03:54:34,770
Oh.

5601
03:54:34,830 --> 03:54:35,230
But relax.

5602
03:54:35,250 --> 03:54:36,190
You're safe from me.

5603
03:54:36,470 --> 03:54:38,370
You look like you might take offense.

5604
03:54:38,810 --> 03:54:39,330
Too risky.

5605
03:54:40,090 --> 03:54:42,890
So then he won't be offended if I pickpocket from him.

5606
03:54:44,330 --> 03:54:46,330
I saw Irene Metric recently.

5607
03:54:46,670 --> 03:54:48,730
She jumped clear over a table at the inn.

5608
03:54:51,030 --> 03:54:52,110
Something you should believe.

5609
03:54:52,210 --> 03:54:53,030
Long hair is cute.

5610
03:54:54,390 --> 03:54:55,270
Mint is cute.

5611
03:54:55,410 --> 03:54:55,790
Believe it.

5612
03:54:55,930 --> 03:54:56,110
Stop.

5613
03:54:58,730 --> 03:54:59,210
Farewell.

5614
03:54:59,850 --> 03:55:01,050
Are you gonna arrest this guy?

5615
03:55:01,170 --> 03:55:03,030
He just admitted to stealing from people.

5616
03:55:03,350 --> 03:55:03,730
Wait.

5617
03:55:03,870 --> 03:55:05,750
If you see me pickpocket from him.

5618
03:55:09,200 --> 03:55:10,980
How does the day greet you, friend?

5619
03:55:11,460 --> 03:55:14,240
A chestnut handy stables now offers to protect you.

5620
03:55:14,260 --> 03:55:17,440
But your horse seems handy enough.

5621
03:55:17,940 --> 03:55:19,520
I've heard others say the same.

5622
03:55:19,880 --> 03:55:22,140
Have you heard any word about the other provinces?

5623
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:27,700
They say syndicates of wizards have led a boycott of imperial goods in the land of the Optimus.

5624
03:55:28,060 --> 03:55:30,680
It seems Somerset Isle has become a much better.

5625
03:55:31,920 --> 03:55:32,640
Oh no.

5626
03:55:32,940 --> 03:55:33,620
It's red.

5627
03:55:33,880 --> 03:55:35,280
I don't think he'll like it.

5628
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:39,100
Excuse you?

5629
03:55:39,320 --> 03:55:41,100
What are you following me for, huh?

5630
03:55:43,080 --> 03:55:44,120
Oh, here we go.

5631
03:55:45,100 --> 03:55:45,700
Save?

5632
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:46,480
So true.

5633
03:55:47,200 --> 03:55:47,820
Okay, here we go.

5634
03:55:49,840 --> 03:55:51,360
How does he notice me?

5635
03:55:58,070 --> 03:55:58,670
Oh.

5636
03:56:01,250 --> 03:56:02,470
Oh, he doesn't.

5637
03:56:02,770 --> 03:56:02,910
Oh.

5638
03:56:04,190 --> 03:56:05,610
Red just means it's illegal.

5639
03:56:05,610 --> 03:56:08,570
Oh, I'm doing illegal activities there.

5640
03:56:08,630 --> 03:56:10,530
A coin for an old beggar.

5641
03:56:17,750 --> 03:56:18,250
Speak.

5642
03:56:21,970 --> 03:56:24,890
If he's a pickpocket, I'm gonna get him first.

5643
03:56:25,070 --> 03:56:26,670
That means he probably has some good stuff.

5644
03:56:31,400 --> 03:56:32,060
All right.

5645
03:56:32,480 --> 03:56:34,200
You have my ear, citizen.

5646
03:56:34,200 --> 03:56:36,200
I don't want to speak to you.

5647
03:56:36,340 --> 03:56:36,780
All right.

5648
03:56:43,260 --> 03:56:44,360
Three gold.

5649
03:56:52,360 --> 03:56:54,600
I got away with it!

5650
03:56:55,780 --> 03:56:56,260
Yeah!

5651
03:57:01,980 --> 03:57:04,020
Turns out he was just grooming his tail.

5652
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:09,220
Aye, it's a thankless job sometimes, but we wouldn't trade it for the world now, would we?

5653
03:57:10,000 --> 03:57:11,400
Is this the guy I need to talk to?

5654
03:57:11,600 --> 03:57:11,900
You hear that?

5655
03:57:12,580 --> 03:57:14,720
But I heard someone calling for a guard.

5656
03:57:15,260 --> 03:57:16,580
I guess that's our cue.

5657
03:57:17,080 --> 03:57:19,020
You have my ear, citizen.

5658
03:57:19,020 --> 03:57:20,740
Nobody called for a guard.

5659
03:57:22,340 --> 03:57:27,000
Guy just wants to get out of the conversation.

5660
03:57:27,720 --> 03:57:27,840
Okay.

5661
03:57:29,300 --> 03:57:30,140
This way.

5662
03:57:32,280 --> 03:57:33,260
For the quest.

5663
03:57:35,820 --> 03:57:37,580
He just wanted to leave.

5664
03:57:38,120 --> 03:57:41,320
I'm like, oh, I think I'm getting a call right now.

5665
03:57:41,700 --> 03:57:43,200
Minto is now mad with power.

5666
03:57:52,230 --> 03:57:52,810
Whoa.

5667
03:57:53,570 --> 03:57:53,990
Whoa.

5668
03:57:54,810 --> 03:57:55,690
My ear, citizen.

5669
03:57:56,150 --> 03:57:56,590
Whoa.

5670
03:57:57,850 --> 03:57:58,330
Whoa.

5671
03:57:59,570 --> 03:58:00,030
Wow.

5672
03:58:01,470 --> 03:58:03,650
Mom, give me a picture with this thing.

5673
03:58:08,800 --> 03:58:09,420
Cheese.

5674
03:58:10,840 --> 03:58:12,440
Say cheese, Ichina.

5675
03:58:14,160 --> 03:58:14,520
Cheese.

5676
03:58:16,060 --> 03:58:16,420
Cheese.

5677
03:58:17,120 --> 03:58:17,840
Cheese.

5678
03:58:18,280 --> 03:58:20,800
The arena poster is a reference to the box art of arena.

5679
03:58:21,500 --> 03:58:22,520
The very...

5680
03:58:22,520 --> 03:58:23,140
The what?

5681
03:58:23,660 --> 03:58:26,020
Did you say first scrolls game?

5682
03:58:27,880 --> 03:58:29,420
The first elder game?

5683
03:58:33,770 --> 03:58:34,390
Nice.

5684
03:58:34,750 --> 03:58:35,350
All right.

5685
03:58:35,450 --> 03:58:36,270
I need to go in here.

5686
03:58:37,090 --> 03:58:37,290
Speak.

5687
03:58:37,530 --> 03:58:38,090
Speak.

5688
03:58:38,470 --> 03:58:40,150
My athletics is growing.

5689
03:58:40,570 --> 03:58:41,250
What's how...

5690
03:58:41,250 --> 03:58:42,990
What's the highest you can get to?

5691
03:58:44,010 --> 03:58:45,090
The first game.

5692
03:58:45,290 --> 03:58:45,510
Oh.

5693
03:58:46,390 --> 03:58:47,010
Neat.

5694
03:58:48,610 --> 03:58:49,890
What is it, citizen?

5695
03:58:49,890 --> 03:58:51,670
Oh, can I have a horse?

5696
03:58:53,570 --> 03:58:54,090
Or...

5697
03:58:56,070 --> 03:58:56,930
Paint horse?

5698
03:58:57,110 --> 03:58:57,190
Oh.

5699
03:58:58,270 --> 03:58:59,010
Can I have that?

5700
03:58:59,570 --> 03:59:00,910
State your business, citizen.

5701
03:59:02,390 --> 03:59:03,130
A hundred.

5702
03:59:04,450 --> 03:59:08,030
He's that thief that the Imperial Watch are always going on about.

5703
03:59:08,310 --> 03:59:09,890
He likes to steal from rich folk.

5704
03:59:10,390 --> 03:59:10,910
Oh.

5705
03:59:11,830 --> 03:59:13,370
Yeah, I've heard of him.

5706
03:59:13,930 --> 03:59:17,130
Isn't he a soldier or a guardsman in the Imperial City?

5707
03:59:19,010 --> 03:59:19,650
Move along.

5708
03:59:24,180 --> 03:59:26,740
I think I need to go far, far away, mister.

5709
03:59:26,940 --> 03:59:27,320
And it's...

5710
03:59:27,320 --> 03:59:32,760
It's at the request of our now deceased...

5711
03:59:32,760 --> 03:59:34,520
I don't know how far of that information...

5712
03:59:34,520 --> 03:59:36,520
I've been gone for probably, like, months.

5713
03:59:36,520 --> 03:59:37,760
I was stuck in a dungeon.

5714
03:59:37,920 --> 03:59:38,980
I don't know how to get it in there.

5715
03:59:38,980 --> 03:59:46,080
But our deceased emperor told me to go on this very important mission.

5716
03:59:46,300 --> 03:59:51,980
And I require a steed to make it happen with haste.

5717
03:59:53,900 --> 03:59:55,240
So you would understand.

5718
04:00:01,130 --> 04:00:02,370
Stop, thief.

5719
04:00:02,870 --> 04:00:03,410
Stop.

5720
04:00:03,930 --> 04:00:05,270
You violated the law.

5721
04:00:05,550 --> 04:00:07,850
Since you lack the funds to pay the court...

5722
04:00:07,850 --> 04:00:08,050
No!

5723
04:00:08,210 --> 04:00:09,470
You must serve out your sentence.

5724
04:00:09,910 --> 04:00:11,850
Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

5725
04:00:13,390 --> 04:00:13,990
Um...

5726
04:00:13,990 --> 04:00:15,290
I'm resisting arrest?

5727
04:00:15,870 --> 04:00:17,690
Then pay with your blood!

5728
04:00:18,510 --> 04:00:19,110
Oh!

5729
04:00:19,250 --> 04:00:19,730
Get me off the horse!

5730
04:00:19,810 --> 04:00:19,870
Oh!

5731
04:00:21,950 --> 04:00:22,550
Run!

5732
04:00:22,770 --> 04:00:23,350
Run, horse!

5733
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:36,170
Oh, I'm frozen.

5734
04:00:36,470 --> 04:00:37,050
Oh, gosh.

5735
04:00:41,020 --> 04:00:41,360
Oops.

5736
04:00:46,020 --> 04:00:48,900
Is this how you play the game, or...

5737
04:00:51,960 --> 04:00:52,640
Oh, wait.

5738
04:00:54,380 --> 04:00:56,780
Did I actually not have to go so far?

5739
04:00:57,380 --> 04:00:58,880
As far as I thought...

5740
04:00:58,880 --> 04:01:00,100
I need to go?

5741
04:01:01,040 --> 04:01:02,420
How do I get off the horse?

5742
04:01:04,040 --> 04:01:04,800
Oh, my gosh.

5743
04:01:05,980 --> 04:01:07,160
Wish I could go faster.

5744
04:01:08,520 --> 04:01:09,520
It's pretty far?

5745
04:01:09,680 --> 04:01:10,720
Okay, it is far, then.

5746
04:01:12,840 --> 04:01:14,000
Sorry that I keep freezing.

5747
04:01:14,000 --> 04:01:15,560
I think the game is...

5748
04:01:15,560 --> 04:01:15,740
I think the game is...

5749
04:01:15,740 --> 04:01:15,920
I'm...

5750
04:01:15,920 --> 04:01:16,180
Heavy.

5751
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:17,380
A little...

5752
04:01:17,380 --> 04:01:18,200
A little heavy.

5753
04:01:19,200 --> 04:01:20,360
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

5754
04:01:21,840 --> 04:01:22,200
Um...

5755
04:01:24,400 --> 04:01:24,920
He won't...

5756
04:01:24,920 --> 04:01:25,520
He won't catch up.

5757
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:27,600
I actually don't even know where he is.

5758
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:28,180
Oh, there he is!

5759
04:01:28,360 --> 04:01:28,620
Oh!

5760
04:01:28,920 --> 04:01:29,500
Go, horse!

5761
04:01:29,620 --> 04:01:29,760
Go!

5762
04:01:35,480 --> 04:01:36,800
It's E to get off.

5763
04:01:36,920 --> 04:01:37,060
Okay.

5764
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:45,620
This is so peaceful.

5765
04:01:48,480 --> 04:01:50,680
Yeah, this is really relaxing, actually.

5766
04:01:52,160 --> 04:01:53,420
Oh, is that...

5767
04:01:53,420 --> 04:01:54,820
Little thing in the top right?

5768
04:01:54,820 --> 04:01:56,020
Wait, does that mean I need to sleep?

5769
04:01:56,260 --> 04:01:57,140
To level up?

5770
04:01:57,760 --> 04:01:59,000
Is that what you guys meant?

5771
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:03,060
It has, like, a moon and a...

5772
04:02:03,060 --> 04:02:03,800
Yeah, okay.

5773
04:02:03,940 --> 04:02:04,680
So we gotta sleep.

5774
04:02:06,300 --> 04:02:08,140
This guy will forget about me, eventually.

5775
04:02:09,140 --> 04:02:09,820
Most likely.

5776
04:02:10,980 --> 04:02:11,460
Probably.

5777
04:02:17,520 --> 04:02:18,000
Ugh.

5778
04:02:19,320 --> 04:02:20,320
This is nice.

5779
04:02:23,100 --> 04:02:24,000
This is good.

5780
04:02:25,000 --> 04:02:26,120
This is...

5781
04:02:26,120 --> 04:02:27,080
Really peaceful.

5782
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:30,140
Music's a little, you know...

5783
04:02:30,140 --> 04:02:33,120
Doesn't suit the situation, but...

5784
04:02:33,120 --> 04:02:34,080
Pretty nice.

5785
04:02:34,660 --> 04:02:35,500
It's, you know...

5786
04:02:36,440 --> 04:02:37,620
What the hell was that?

5787
04:02:40,240 --> 04:02:41,280
Is that a squirrel?

5788
04:02:42,300 --> 04:02:42,820
Oh!

5789
04:02:43,060 --> 04:02:43,340
Oh!

5790
04:02:43,640 --> 04:02:43,800
Oh!

5791
04:02:44,140 --> 04:02:44,240
Oh!

5792
04:02:44,660 --> 04:02:45,160
Keep going!

5793
04:02:45,500 --> 04:02:46,000
Go, horse!

5794
04:02:46,100 --> 04:02:46,220
Go!

5795
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:48,620
Fort Ash.

5796
04:02:50,420 --> 04:02:51,860
Hey, there's, like, some guy!

5797
04:02:52,100 --> 04:02:53,180
He's posing as a...

5798
04:02:53,180 --> 04:02:53,900
As a knight!

5799
04:02:57,220 --> 04:02:58,500
They're all after me.

5800
04:02:59,980 --> 04:03:00,520
Um...

5801
04:03:02,160 --> 04:03:03,480
Maybe I should kill them.

5802
04:03:06,730 --> 04:03:08,290
So that they forget about me.

5803
04:03:08,730 --> 04:03:11,950
You know, like, the hoglins, the piglins, and...

5804
04:03:11,950 --> 04:03:13,170
And Minecraft.

5805
04:03:13,790 --> 04:03:15,250
If you kill them...

5806
04:03:16,910 --> 04:03:17,790
They won't...

5807
04:03:17,790 --> 04:03:18,030
They won't...

5808
04:03:18,030 --> 04:03:18,290
Then...

5809
04:03:19,810 --> 04:03:20,250
You...

5810
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:28,280
Wait.

5811
04:03:28,500 --> 04:03:29,180
I need to go this way.

5812
04:03:39,700 --> 04:03:40,140
Oh!

5813
04:03:40,380 --> 04:03:41,300
Deliver the amulet!

5814
04:03:45,780 --> 04:03:47,140
I already think those guys are.

5815
04:03:49,160 --> 04:03:50,120
There he goes.

5816
04:03:51,500 --> 04:03:52,580
Slowly but surely.

5817
04:03:53,100 --> 04:03:53,220
Oh.

5818
04:03:53,400 --> 04:03:54,340
I think he's coming this way.

5819
04:03:55,660 --> 04:03:57,440
Your horse is coming back to you!

5820
04:04:02,370 --> 04:04:03,690
Try sneaking now.

5821
04:04:03,950 --> 04:04:04,830
I think he saw me.

5822
04:04:05,210 --> 04:04:05,430
Uh-oh.

5823
04:04:05,850 --> 04:04:05,970
Uh.

5824
04:04:07,030 --> 04:04:07,250
Oh.

5825
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:07,870
I didn't have mine.

5826
04:04:11,520 --> 04:04:11,960
Oh.

5827
04:04:12,080 --> 04:04:12,580
He's powerful.

5828
04:04:14,100 --> 04:04:14,540
Oh.

5829
04:04:14,640 --> 04:04:14,900
He's...

5830
04:04:14,900 --> 04:04:15,360
He's strong.

5831
04:04:15,620 --> 04:04:15,960
Oh.

5832
04:04:16,500 --> 04:04:17,240
I'm in trouble.

5833
04:04:17,660 --> 04:04:18,920
I think I'm in trouble, guys.

5834
04:04:19,280 --> 04:04:19,720
Oh.

5835
04:04:19,780 --> 04:04:20,220
I'm in trouble.

5836
04:04:20,560 --> 04:04:20,920
Oh.

5837
04:04:21,020 --> 04:04:21,440
I'm in trouble.

5838
04:04:21,740 --> 04:04:22,100
Oh.

5839
04:04:22,360 --> 04:04:22,720
Oh.

5840
04:04:22,940 --> 04:04:23,260
Wait.

5841
04:04:23,300 --> 04:04:24,100
It's for the emperor!

5842
04:04:24,960 --> 04:04:26,180
It's for the emperor!

5843
04:04:26,180 --> 04:04:27,120
No!

5844
04:04:28,300 --> 04:04:29,040
Please!

5845
04:04:31,420 --> 04:04:31,980
Please!

5846
04:04:34,660 --> 04:04:35,380
Oh, gosh.

5847
04:04:37,180 --> 04:04:37,740
Please!

5848
04:04:40,500 --> 04:04:41,900
It's for the emperor!

5849
04:04:43,080 --> 04:04:44,360
I promise you!

5850
04:04:45,700 --> 04:04:46,460
Oh, gosh.

5851
04:04:46,580 --> 04:04:46,680
Ouch.

5852
04:04:47,600 --> 04:04:51,920
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running,

5853
04:04:51,920 --> 04:05:02,460
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running,

5854
04:05:02,560 --> 04:05:07,520
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm

5855
04:05:12,150 --> 04:05:21,590
running, I'm running A few more.

5856
04:05:22,850 --> 04:05:23,810
Slowly but surely.

5857
04:05:24,530 --> 04:05:25,470
He's so fast.

5858
04:05:26,370 --> 04:05:26,690
Oh my god!

5859
04:05:26,890 --> 04:05:27,070
Ah!

5860
04:05:27,250 --> 04:05:27,810
That's a kill!

5861
04:05:27,970 --> 04:05:28,410
That's a hill!

5862
04:05:33,050 --> 04:05:33,570
Run.

5863
04:05:33,770 --> 04:05:34,410
Run, run, run.

5864
04:05:41,500 --> 04:05:42,320
So close.

5865
04:05:42,580 --> 04:05:43,260
So close.

5866
04:05:43,600 --> 04:05:44,340
So close.

5867
04:05:44,780 --> 04:05:45,580
Almost got him.

5868
04:05:45,960 --> 04:05:46,540
Almost have him.

5869
04:05:49,620 --> 04:05:52,080
Your killing has been observed by forces unknown.

5870
04:05:52,080 --> 04:05:54,640
It was a self-defense!

5871
04:05:56,910 --> 04:05:57,740
Hide the body.

5872
04:06:09,970 --> 04:06:11,550
You broke the law.

5873
04:06:12,150 --> 04:06:14,350
I needed it to get to here.

5874
04:06:16,770 --> 04:06:19,350
This was such a journey.

5875
04:06:19,850 --> 04:06:22,930
This was the hardest task I've ever done, ever.

5876
04:06:27,270 --> 04:06:27,970
Hello?

5877
04:06:29,330 --> 04:06:31,430
Oh, you didn't probably see anything that happened.

5878
04:06:31,990 --> 04:06:32,950
I'm the shepherd here.

5879
04:06:33,810 --> 04:06:34,590
Eranor's the name.

5880
04:06:34,930 --> 04:06:36,370
And this is Waynan Priory.

5881
04:06:37,250 --> 04:06:38,130
Waynan Priory.

5882
04:06:38,190 --> 04:06:39,030
What's going on?

5883
04:06:39,110 --> 04:06:40,510
I see no reason to talk to him.

5884
04:06:42,730 --> 04:06:43,030
Oh!

5885
04:06:43,390 --> 04:06:43,590
Oh!

5886
04:06:43,970 --> 04:06:44,410
Okay.

5887
04:06:46,390 --> 04:06:51,290
If he's not sleeping or eating, he'll be fussing with his books, I reckon, over in the Priory house.

5888
04:06:53,670 --> 04:06:54,670
Stop talking!

5889
04:06:55,090 --> 04:06:55,970
Oh my god!

5890
04:06:57,590 --> 04:06:59,010
They're so rude!

5891
04:07:00,690 --> 04:07:02,070
Put my feasts away.

5892
04:07:02,330 --> 04:07:02,390
Put my feasts away.

5893
04:07:03,030 --> 04:07:03,910
Well, I...

5894
04:07:03,910 --> 04:07:04,670
I needed them.

5895
04:07:04,990 --> 04:07:05,930
In the...

5896
04:07:07,110 --> 04:07:07,670
Priory?

5897
04:07:09,510 --> 04:07:10,970
Hey, you know, mister...

5898
04:07:10,970 --> 04:07:12,630
I could've really used this horse.

5899
04:07:13,550 --> 04:07:13,790
Hey.

5900
04:07:13,990 --> 04:07:14,210
Yes?

5901
04:07:15,450 --> 04:07:16,010
Um...

5902
04:07:16,010 --> 04:07:17,430
I'm gonna woo him over.

5903
04:07:17,710 --> 04:07:18,370
Make it quick.

5904
04:07:18,370 --> 04:07:19,330
Oh, okay.

5905
04:07:21,590 --> 04:07:22,150
Uh...

5906
04:07:22,150 --> 04:07:23,590
Uh, he doesn't...

5907
04:07:23,590 --> 04:07:24,010
Oh, start.

5908
04:07:24,290 --> 04:07:24,530
Yeah.

5909
04:07:29,770 --> 04:07:31,810
I don't really understand how this works.

5910
04:07:33,750 --> 04:07:34,310
So...

5911
04:07:34,970 --> 04:07:35,890
If I like...

5912
04:07:38,030 --> 04:07:39,530
You're wasting your bra...

5913
04:07:39,530 --> 04:07:40,530
You're pathetic.

5914
04:07:40,970 --> 04:07:41,110
Oh!

5915
04:07:41,530 --> 04:07:41,810
That...

5916
04:07:41,810 --> 04:07:43,130
I like you, too.

5917
04:07:43,590 --> 04:07:44,390
I think I get it.

5918
04:07:44,450 --> 04:07:45,430
Oh, so the thing that...

5919
04:07:45,430 --> 04:07:45,710
Wait.

5920
04:07:45,850 --> 04:07:47,750
So you do...

5921
04:07:48,670 --> 04:07:49,310
You do...

5922
04:07:49,310 --> 04:07:49,630
Sorry.

5923
04:07:49,790 --> 04:07:50,930
I'm, like, lagging so bad.

5924
04:07:53,570 --> 04:07:54,230
See his face.

5925
04:07:54,310 --> 04:07:54,570
No, no.

5926
04:07:54,610 --> 04:07:55,210
I get that.

5927
04:07:55,690 --> 04:07:59,110
But I don't understand which to start with first, is what I...

5928
04:07:59,110 --> 04:08:01,550
You want fewer bars when he doesn't like something.

5929
04:08:01,670 --> 04:08:02,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5930
04:08:03,350 --> 04:08:03,710
So...

5931
04:08:05,930 --> 04:08:06,530
Oh!

5932
04:08:07,070 --> 04:08:07,630
That's great!

5933
04:08:08,110 --> 04:08:09,450
That's really too much!

5934
04:08:09,750 --> 04:08:10,510
Oh, I see, too.

5935
04:08:10,810 --> 04:08:11,050
Thank you.

5936
04:08:13,070 --> 04:08:14,050
You're pathetic.

5937
04:08:14,330 --> 04:08:14,450
Oh!

5938
04:08:14,810 --> 04:08:15,050
Oh!

5939
04:08:15,270 --> 04:08:16,550
It went down so much!

5940
04:08:16,630 --> 04:08:16,850
Oh!

5941
04:08:17,010 --> 04:08:17,430
I didn't...

5942
04:08:18,790 --> 04:08:19,390
Oops.

5943
04:08:19,630 --> 04:08:20,190
I didn't...

5944
04:08:20,190 --> 04:08:20,350
Oh.

5945
04:08:21,550 --> 04:08:22,690
Are you serious?

5946
04:08:23,410 --> 04:08:23,830
Sorry.

5947
04:08:24,150 --> 04:08:24,750
Sorry.

5948
04:08:25,070 --> 04:08:25,370
Um.

5949
04:08:26,290 --> 04:08:26,710
Sorry.

5950
04:08:27,150 --> 04:08:27,630
Sorry.

5951
04:08:27,630 --> 04:08:29,050
I'm done talking to you.

5952
04:08:29,230 --> 04:08:29,690
Sorry.

5953
04:08:29,970 --> 04:08:30,530
Sorry.

5954
04:08:30,790 --> 04:08:31,150
Sorry.

5955
04:08:31,890 --> 04:08:32,490
Sorry.

5956
04:08:32,790 --> 04:08:33,370
Sorry.

5957
04:08:36,290 --> 04:08:36,970
Uh...

5958
04:08:38,070 --> 04:08:38,750
Uh...

5959
04:08:38,750 --> 04:08:41,510
You guys...

5960
04:08:43,970 --> 04:08:45,930
I'm gonna give the...

5961
04:08:47,650 --> 04:08:48,690
Negative res.

5962
04:08:48,890 --> 04:08:50,510
Oh, what happened to my personality?

5963
04:08:50,850 --> 04:08:53,010
I was supposed to have the wonderful personality.

5964
04:08:53,230 --> 04:08:54,070
ET, you're...

5965
04:08:54,450 --> 04:08:55,090
You're...

5966
04:08:55,850 --> 04:08:56,190
You're...

5967
04:08:56,190 --> 04:08:56,870
You're messing this up!

5968
04:08:57,470 --> 04:08:58,150
You're...

5969
04:08:58,150 --> 04:08:59,190
You are...

5970
04:08:59,190 --> 04:08:59,650
You...

5971
04:09:06,420 --> 04:09:06,940
Uh...

5972
04:09:07,480 --> 04:09:07,740
Ah!

5973
04:09:10,680 --> 04:09:12,100
You had one job!

5974
04:09:12,420 --> 04:09:12,820
Hahaha!

5975
04:09:13,660 --> 04:09:15,020
Okay, let's go get the amulet.

5976
04:09:15,140 --> 04:09:17,500
And then I think I'm gonna call it because the game is like...

5977
04:09:17,500 --> 04:09:18,840
Bugging my computer.

5978
04:09:19,020 --> 04:09:19,640
It's getting worse.

5979
04:09:20,140 --> 04:09:20,920
I fear.

5980
04:09:21,880 --> 04:09:22,840
Oh, wow!

5981
04:09:23,680 --> 04:09:24,740
Look at that guy!

5982
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:25,380
He's so cute!

5983
04:09:27,620 --> 04:09:28,140
Oh.

5984
04:09:28,480 --> 04:09:30,280
Can he leave or...

5985
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:31,420
That's probably fine.

5986
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:36,000
Okay, where is this guy at anyway?

5987
04:09:36,460 --> 04:09:36,940
In here?

5988
04:09:38,520 --> 04:09:39,040
Maybe?

5989
04:09:41,820 --> 04:09:42,340
Maybe?

5990
04:09:44,040 --> 04:09:44,960
Well met.

5991
04:09:45,420 --> 04:09:45,560
Yes?

5992
04:09:45,860 --> 04:09:48,260
That Honditar sure knows his way around this area.

5993
04:09:48,600 --> 04:09:50,220
Have you spoken with him recently?

5994
04:09:50,560 --> 04:09:52,040
I spoke to him recently.

5995
04:09:52,340 --> 04:09:54,140
He really knows his way around.

5996
04:09:54,280 --> 04:09:56,680
Knows every tree, rock, and cave in the area.

5997
04:09:57,440 --> 04:10:00,240
Have you heard any word about the other provinces?

5998
04:10:00,760 --> 04:10:05,680
They say syndicates of wizards have led a boycott of Imperial goods in the land of the Ultima.

5999
04:10:05,820 --> 04:10:07,020
Where's the...

6000
04:10:07,020 --> 04:10:08,460
Where's the subtitles?

6001
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:10,920
Could be a dangerous situation.

6002
04:10:11,760 --> 04:10:12,520
Joffrey's chest!

6003
04:10:12,860 --> 04:10:13,540
Wait, Joffrey.

6004
04:10:13,840 --> 04:10:15,320
Which one of you is Joffrey?

6005
04:10:15,740 --> 04:10:16,040
Hello?

6006
04:10:16,200 --> 04:10:16,380
Oh!

6007
04:10:16,880 --> 04:10:17,680
Can I help you?

6008
04:10:21,640 --> 04:10:23,360
I must speak to Joffrey!

6009
04:10:23,560 --> 04:10:24,080
He's upstairs.

6010
04:10:24,500 --> 04:10:24,960
Go ahead.

6011
04:10:25,300 --> 04:10:26,220
That's where I was...

6012
04:10:26,220 --> 04:10:27,020
Oh, thank you, sir!

6013
04:10:27,140 --> 04:10:28,140
How can I help you?

6014
04:10:31,400 --> 04:10:32,740
I don't think he is upstairs.

6015
04:10:33,080 --> 04:10:33,540
Oh, there's...

6016
04:10:33,540 --> 04:10:33,920
Yes, he is.

6017
04:10:35,700 --> 04:10:36,820
I'm brother Joffrey.

6018
04:10:36,920 --> 04:10:37,420
What do you want?

6019
04:10:37,420 --> 04:10:39,340
I almost stole from his chest right in front of him.

6020
04:10:39,380 --> 04:10:40,360
He blended in with the...

6021
04:10:40,360 --> 04:10:41,020
With the window.

6022
04:10:42,420 --> 04:10:44,060
The Emperor sent me to find you.

6023
04:10:44,180 --> 04:10:44,840
Emperor Uriel?

6024
04:10:45,500 --> 04:10:47,220
Do you know something about his death?

6025
04:10:47,300 --> 04:10:47,760
Oh, wow.

6026
04:10:47,980 --> 04:10:49,280
Word spreads really fast.

6027
04:10:49,400 --> 04:10:51,100
I was there when he died.

6028
04:10:51,480 --> 04:10:52,940
You'd better explain yourself.

6029
04:10:53,280 --> 04:10:53,720
Now.

6030
04:10:54,460 --> 04:10:56,440
He gave me the Amulet of Kings.

6031
04:10:56,760 --> 04:10:58,540
You brought me the Amulet of Kings?

6032
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:00,120
This cannot be.

6033
04:11:00,580 --> 04:11:01,660
Let me see it.

6034
04:11:02,960 --> 04:11:04,060
By the Nine!

6035
04:11:04,060 --> 04:11:06,540
This is the Amulet of Kings.

6036
04:11:07,060 --> 04:11:07,940
Who are you?

6037
04:11:08,320 --> 04:11:09,400
How did you get this?

6038
04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:11,680
What do you know of the Emperor's death?

6039
04:11:11,960 --> 04:11:12,680
I'm E.T.

6040
04:11:13,380 --> 04:11:13,980
Of...

6041
04:11:13,980 --> 04:11:14,980
Of E.T.

6042
04:11:15,180 --> 04:11:15,980
Movie fame.

6043
04:11:16,460 --> 04:11:18,040
Tell the Emperor's last words.

6044
04:11:18,280 --> 04:11:21,020
As unlikely as your story sounds, I believe you.

6045
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:26,920
Only the strange destiny of Uriel Septim could have brought you to me carrying the Amulet of Kings.

6046
04:11:29,500 --> 04:11:30,020
Um...

6047
04:11:30,020 --> 04:11:32,180
Clothes shut the jaws of Oblivion?

6048
04:11:32,480 --> 04:11:34,480
His meaning is unclear to me as well.

6049
04:11:34,680 --> 04:11:34,900
Oh.

6050
04:11:35,300 --> 04:11:39,080
The Emperor seemed to perceive some threat from the demonic world of Oblivion.

6051
04:11:39,300 --> 04:11:43,440
The Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, is one of the Lords of Oblivion.

6052
04:11:43,540 --> 04:11:43,780
Oh.

6053
04:11:44,080 --> 04:11:48,100
But the mortal world is protected from the Daedra of Oblivion by magical barriers.

6054
04:11:48,260 --> 04:11:48,700
Ah.

6055
04:11:49,800 --> 04:11:51,960
How can Oblivion threaten us then?

6056
04:11:51,960 --> 04:11:52,580
I'm not sure.

6057
04:11:53,100 --> 04:11:57,280
Only the Emperors truly understand the meaning behind the rituals of coronation.

6058
04:11:57,700 --> 04:11:59,680
The Amulet of Kings is ancient.

6059
04:12:00,120 --> 04:12:02,620
Saint Alicia herself received it from the gods.

6060
04:12:03,340 --> 04:12:05,000
It is a holy relic of great power.

6061
04:12:05,000 --> 04:12:06,300
What if they trained?

6062
04:12:06,320 --> 04:12:12,340
When an Emperor is crowned, he uses the Amulet to light the Dragonfires at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.

6063
04:12:12,800 --> 04:12:19,980
With the Emperor dead and no new heir crowned, the Dragonfires in the Temple will be dark for the first time in centuries.

6064
04:12:19,980 --> 04:12:20,800
In centuries.

6065
04:12:20,860 --> 04:12:25,040
It may be that the Dragonfires protected us from a threat that only the Emperor was aware of.

6066
04:12:25,160 --> 04:12:25,480
Oh.

6067
04:12:26,580 --> 04:12:28,880
The Emperor asked me to find his son.

6068
04:12:29,120 --> 04:12:31,180
I am one of the few who know of his existence.

6069
04:12:32,100 --> 04:12:36,300
Many years ago, I served as captain of Uriel's bodyguards, the Blades.

6070
04:12:36,520 --> 04:12:36,900
The Blades.

6071
04:12:36,960 --> 04:12:39,340
One night, Uriel called me into his private chambers.

6072
04:12:39,820 --> 04:12:42,020
A baby boy lay sleeping in a basket.

6073
04:12:43,040 --> 04:12:45,320
Uriel told me to deliver him somewhere safe.

6074
04:12:45,840 --> 04:12:49,900
He never told me anything else about the baby, but I knew it was his son.

6075
04:12:50,640 --> 04:12:53,460
From time to time, he would ask about the child's progress.

6076
04:12:53,740 --> 04:12:54,560
I hope it's...

6077
04:12:54,560 --> 04:12:57,480
Now, it seems that this illegitimate son is the heir to the septic stone.

6078
04:12:57,480 --> 04:12:58,860
It's not the guy downstairs, is it?

6079
04:12:58,880 --> 04:12:59,440
If he yet lives.

6080
04:12:59,440 --> 04:13:00,300
The stable owner?

6081
04:13:01,240 --> 04:13:03,400
Where can I find Uriel's son?

6082
04:13:03,500 --> 04:13:04,300
His name is Martin.

6083
04:13:04,500 --> 04:13:04,940
Martin?

6084
04:13:05,120 --> 04:13:08,520
He serves Akatosh in the chapel in the city of Kvatch, south of here.

6085
04:13:08,680 --> 04:13:08,920
Normal.

6086
04:13:08,920 --> 04:13:11,080
You must go to Kvatch and find him at once.

6087
04:13:11,540 --> 04:13:16,260
If the enemy is aware of his existence, as seems likely, he is in terrible danger.

6088
04:13:16,780 --> 04:13:19,580
And please, let me know if there's anything you need.

6089
04:13:20,080 --> 04:13:23,620
My resources here are limited, but I will help in any way I can.

6090
04:13:24,060 --> 04:13:25,520
Thank you, Joffrey.

6091
04:13:26,420 --> 04:13:26,900
Okay.

6092
04:13:26,900 --> 04:13:27,160
Oh, wow.

6093
04:13:27,640 --> 04:13:29,020
He has a lot of information.

6094
04:13:30,300 --> 04:13:31,180
Waste no time.

6095
04:13:31,440 --> 04:13:33,780
You must find Martin before the enemy does.

6096
04:13:34,100 --> 04:13:34,460
Okay.

6097
04:13:35,080 --> 04:13:35,640
Thank you, sir.

6098
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:38,260
Thank you, sir.

6099
04:13:39,660 --> 04:13:42,700
Guys, I want to keep playing, but I'm afraid for my computer.

6100
04:13:46,560 --> 04:13:49,160
Is it illegal to just open it?

6101
04:13:50,560 --> 04:13:52,160
What if I don't take anything?

6102
04:13:54,760 --> 04:13:56,120
Asking for free goods.

6103
04:13:57,480 --> 04:13:59,940
It's just illegal to be curious?

6104
04:14:00,380 --> 04:14:02,260
Is curiosity a crime?

6105
04:14:08,030 --> 04:14:12,170
Your first priority now should be to find Martin and bring him back here.

6106
04:14:13,750 --> 04:14:14,310
Assistant.

6107
04:14:14,770 --> 04:14:17,950
I keep a few things here in my chest to resupply traveling blades.

6108
04:14:18,230 --> 04:14:20,010
Help yourself to whatever you need.

6109
04:14:21,030 --> 04:14:22,530
Thank you, Joffrey.

6110
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:24,270
Where are you going?

6111
04:14:27,840 --> 04:14:30,060
He unlocked it for me, even.

6112
04:14:37,090 --> 04:14:37,650
Leather.

6113
04:14:40,590 --> 04:14:41,630
Steel bow!

6114
04:14:42,470 --> 04:14:43,670
Steel bow, baby.

6115
04:14:43,950 --> 04:14:44,950
Steel arrow!

6116
04:14:47,510 --> 04:14:48,590
Wow, it's garbage.

6117
04:14:48,770 --> 04:14:49,210
Not for me!

6118
04:14:49,390 --> 04:14:50,890
I only have an iron bow!

6119
04:14:53,830 --> 04:14:54,550
Good boy.

6120
04:14:58,170 --> 04:14:59,070
Steel bow.

6121
04:14:59,450 --> 04:15:00,630
It's like it's my destiny.

6122
04:15:02,210 --> 04:15:02,690
Steel.

6123
04:15:04,310 --> 04:15:04,790
Steel!

6124
04:15:08,050 --> 04:15:12,250
I could have used that against a guy out there who's being a major jerk.

6125
04:15:12,250 --> 04:15:12,690
Oh.

6126
04:15:12,930 --> 04:15:13,430
Hello.

6127
04:15:13,830 --> 04:15:14,710
Brother Piner.

6128
04:15:15,450 --> 04:15:16,710
Welcome, good citizen.

6129
04:15:17,110 --> 04:15:18,250
I'm Brother Piner.

6130
04:15:18,570 --> 04:15:19,910
And this is William Priory.

6131
04:15:20,230 --> 04:15:20,510
He said he could have it!

6132
04:15:20,510 --> 04:15:21,730
Intense to you.

6133
04:15:21,950 --> 04:15:22,830
Can I help you?

6134
04:15:24,950 --> 04:15:25,590
Um...

6135
04:15:26,090 --> 04:15:26,410
No.

6136
04:15:27,090 --> 04:15:27,730
What?

6137
04:15:28,790 --> 04:15:29,430
Anvil...

6138
04:15:30,230 --> 04:15:30,870
Sorry.

6139
04:15:31,050 --> 04:15:31,950
Anvil Chapel attack.

6140
04:15:32,310 --> 04:15:33,910
Things go from bad to worse nowadays.

6141
04:15:34,610 --> 04:15:35,250
Priests.

6142
04:15:35,470 --> 04:15:37,110
Murdered on the chapel altar.

6143
04:15:37,110 --> 04:15:37,670
Oh!

6144
04:15:38,170 --> 04:15:39,230
What next?

6145
04:15:39,430 --> 04:15:40,050
What?

6146
04:15:40,470 --> 04:15:41,010
What?

6147
04:15:41,010 --> 04:15:41,750
Good day.

6148
04:15:43,790 --> 04:15:44,970
Greetings to you.

6149
04:15:45,230 --> 04:15:45,790
Nothing.

6150
04:15:45,950 --> 04:15:46,870
You can't even look at me.

6151
04:15:47,630 --> 04:15:48,070
They're...

6152
04:15:48,070 --> 04:15:48,590
They're...

6153
04:15:48,590 --> 04:15:50,490
They hate me.

6154
04:15:52,930 --> 04:15:53,290
Gosh.

6155
04:15:53,410 --> 04:15:55,550
I really wanna just do like a...

6156
04:15:56,110 --> 04:15:56,870
Absolute...

6157
04:15:57,950 --> 04:15:58,670
Sicko mode.

6158
04:15:58,670 --> 04:15:59,990
I murder everyone.

6159
04:16:00,270 --> 04:16:01,310
I steal everywhere.

6160
04:16:01,490 --> 04:16:03,190
I just wanna go off.

6161
04:16:05,430 --> 04:16:08,170
The chest that Joffrey opened for you is marked safe too.

6162
04:16:08,290 --> 04:16:09,610
It won't respawn its contents.

6163
04:16:10,230 --> 04:16:10,370
Oh!

6164
04:16:10,790 --> 04:16:11,290
Okay, cool.

6165
04:16:11,430 --> 04:16:11,890
Good to know.

6166
04:16:18,000 --> 04:16:18,880
I'm glad...

6167
04:16:18,880 --> 04:16:20,680
You are getting to enjoy Oblivion.

6168
04:16:21,300 --> 04:16:21,860
Oh my goodness.

6169
04:16:21,980 --> 04:16:22,080
Stop.

6170
04:16:24,460 --> 04:16:28,040
I know they kept some of the more famous bugs in on purpose for nostalgia.

6171
04:16:28,420 --> 04:16:28,860
Yeah!

6172
04:16:29,440 --> 04:16:31,260
That's why I'm excited to see...

6173
04:16:32,140 --> 04:16:33,460
Wayne and Lodge.

6174
04:16:36,460 --> 04:16:37,620
It's getting night time.

6175
04:16:37,720 --> 04:16:39,640
Are there like different enemies out...

6176
04:16:39,640 --> 04:16:40,840
At night?

6177
04:16:41,140 --> 04:16:41,360
Wow.

6178
04:16:41,900 --> 04:16:43,920
The Aurora Borealis.

6179
04:16:47,260 --> 04:16:48,720
Oh, sleep and level up.

6180
04:16:48,840 --> 04:16:49,020
Yeah.

6181
04:16:53,310 --> 04:16:53,950
Yeah.

6182
04:16:55,850 --> 04:16:57,390
I could probably sleep in here.

6183
04:16:58,730 --> 04:17:00,330
At this time of year.

6184
04:17:00,630 --> 04:17:02,230
This time of day.

6185
04:17:02,850 --> 04:17:05,670
Localized entirely in this village.

6186
04:17:08,590 --> 04:17:09,230
What?

6187
04:17:09,470 --> 04:17:11,370
Why can't I eat the bread?

6188
04:17:11,890 --> 04:17:13,630
Am I not a guest here?

6189
04:17:13,890 --> 04:17:15,730
Am I not a coveted guest?

6190
04:17:18,570 --> 04:17:20,270
How long would you like to sleep?

6191
04:17:21,810 --> 04:17:22,890
24 hours.

6192
04:17:24,170 --> 04:17:25,610
We'll get a healthy...

6193
04:17:25,610 --> 04:17:26,670
Nine...

6194
04:17:26,670 --> 04:17:27,870
Eight hours in.

6195
04:17:33,930 --> 04:17:35,590
You have ascended to level two!

6196
04:17:39,780 --> 04:17:41,940
No mother, it's just the northern lies.

6197
04:17:42,700 --> 04:17:43,260
May I see?

6198
04:17:48,500 --> 04:17:49,500
I have a visitor.

6199
04:17:49,700 --> 04:17:50,440
What do you mean a visitor?

6200
04:17:50,900 --> 04:17:52,080
The air grows chill.

6201
04:17:52,880 --> 04:17:53,660
What does that mean?

6202
04:17:54,500 --> 04:17:55,460
F-S-R?

6203
04:17:56,120 --> 04:17:56,940
Go to the ground.

6204
04:17:57,480 --> 04:17:58,140
Choose F-S-R.

6205
04:17:58,280 --> 04:17:58,660
Upscaling.

6206
04:17:58,860 --> 04:17:59,600
Set it to quality.

6207
04:17:59,900 --> 04:18:00,660
Or balance.

6208
04:18:00,840 --> 04:18:01,500
Oh, thank you.

6209
04:18:01,760 --> 04:18:02,680
Actually, I didn't see that.

6210
04:18:02,760 --> 04:18:03,380
I didn't check that.

6211
04:18:03,520 --> 04:18:03,980
So I don't know.

6212
04:18:04,280 --> 04:18:04,900
Let's see.

6213
04:18:08,700 --> 04:18:10,260
I wonder if I should...

6214
04:18:10,260 --> 04:18:11,760
Do more strength.

6215
04:18:14,700 --> 04:18:16,760
I wonder if I should do more strength.

6216
04:18:18,300 --> 04:18:21,580
Because I'm so weak when I have to use a sword.

6217
04:18:22,440 --> 04:18:23,860
Strength is for the carry...

6218
04:18:23,860 --> 04:18:24,520
For the carry weight.

6219
04:18:24,620 --> 04:18:25,160
Is that...

6220
04:18:25,160 --> 04:18:26,740
I just bit my tongue.

6221
04:18:27,600 --> 04:18:29,100
Does that actually have an effect?

6222
04:18:31,880 --> 04:18:32,380
Strength.

6223
04:18:33,760 --> 04:18:34,260
Endurance.

6224
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:36,080
Intelligence.

6225
04:18:38,600 --> 04:18:39,560
F for details.

6226
04:18:40,340 --> 04:18:40,760
Oh, thank you.

6227
04:18:43,160 --> 04:18:44,500
Defines how much you can carry.

6228
04:18:44,660 --> 04:18:46,120
And slightly increases your maximum health.

6229
04:18:46,360 --> 04:18:46,700
You know what?

6230
04:18:46,760 --> 04:18:47,880
I think I will go with that.

6231
04:18:48,180 --> 04:18:48,580
And then...

6232
04:18:48,580 --> 04:18:49,900
Endurance is...

6233
04:18:49,900 --> 04:18:51,240
Regenerate health...

6234
04:18:51,560 --> 04:18:52,380
Out of combat.

6235
04:18:52,680 --> 04:18:53,940
And my maximum health.

6236
04:18:54,200 --> 04:18:54,900
Intelligence is...

6237
04:18:56,280 --> 04:18:56,800
Magicka.

6238
04:18:57,520 --> 04:18:58,560
Maybe agility.

6239
04:19:03,720 --> 04:19:05,600
My personality sucks.

6240
04:19:10,590 --> 04:19:11,350
Which one?

6241
04:19:11,530 --> 04:19:12,210
Oh, bows.

6242
04:19:12,350 --> 04:19:12,870
Yes, yes, yes.

6243
04:19:12,870 --> 04:19:13,630
I was gonna say...

6244
04:19:13,630 --> 04:19:13,850
Which one?

6245
04:19:13,970 --> 04:19:16,250
Wait, I only read daggers and short swords.

6246
04:19:22,440 --> 04:19:23,420
Oh my gosh.

6247
04:19:23,900 --> 04:19:24,660
Wait, so is...

6248
04:19:24,660 --> 04:19:25,720
Does it max at 100?

6249
04:19:34,730 --> 04:19:35,250
Yes?

6250
04:19:36,510 --> 04:19:39,030
Okay, then it's fine if I kinda keep...

6251
04:19:39,650 --> 04:19:40,170
Power...

6252
04:19:40,170 --> 04:19:41,610
Put on the...

6253
04:19:41,610 --> 04:19:43,930
Agility so we can get to 100 quickly.

6254
04:19:45,330 --> 04:19:46,870
Then you move on to a different stat.

6255
04:19:48,990 --> 04:19:49,430
Oh...

6256
04:19:50,570 --> 04:19:51,010
Ah...

6257
04:19:51,010 --> 04:19:52,850
Base maxes at 100.

6258
04:19:53,250 --> 04:19:53,690
Okay.

6259
04:19:54,810 --> 04:19:55,250
Cool.

6260
04:19:55,430 --> 04:19:56,270
I think I'll go with this one.

6261
04:19:57,910 --> 04:20:00,230
You sleep rather soundly for a murderer.

6262
04:20:00,230 --> 04:20:00,890
Oh my god!

6263
04:20:01,450 --> 04:20:02,230
That's good.

6264
04:20:02,430 --> 04:20:02,870
A murderer?

6265
04:20:03,150 --> 04:20:06,430
You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose.

6266
04:20:06,430 --> 04:20:07,210
Wait, what happened?

6267
04:20:08,230 --> 04:20:08,430
Who...

6268
04:20:08,950 --> 04:20:09,410
Who...

6269
04:20:09,410 --> 04:20:09,810
Who...

6270
04:20:09,810 --> 04:20:10,850
Who are you?

6271
04:20:11,290 --> 04:20:13,090
I am Lucian Lachance.

6272
04:20:13,270 --> 04:20:13,650
Lachance.

6273
04:20:13,670 --> 04:20:15,490
A speaker for the Dark Brotherhood and you.

6274
04:20:16,190 --> 04:20:17,250
You are a killer.

6275
04:20:17,290 --> 04:20:18,070
No, a self-defense.

6276
04:20:18,270 --> 04:20:18,790
Taker of life.

6277
04:20:18,950 --> 04:20:20,270
A harvester of souls.

6278
04:20:20,430 --> 04:20:20,790
Self-defense.

6279
04:20:20,790 --> 04:20:20,810
What?

6280
04:20:21,810 --> 04:20:22,250
Your work.

6281
04:20:22,730 --> 04:20:23,990
Your death craft.

6282
04:20:24,470 --> 04:20:26,330
Pleases the night mother.

6283
04:20:26,890 --> 04:20:27,290
The night mom.

6284
04:20:27,290 --> 04:20:27,610
And so.

6285
04:20:28,290 --> 04:20:29,130
I come to you.

6286
04:20:29,410 --> 04:20:30,950
With an authoring.

6287
04:20:31,070 --> 04:20:32,470
An opportunity.

6288
04:20:33,470 --> 04:20:34,010
To join.

6289
04:20:34,690 --> 04:20:35,190
Our rather.

6290
04:20:35,870 --> 04:20:36,050
Unique.

6291
04:20:36,490 --> 04:20:36,970
Family.

6292
04:20:37,590 --> 04:20:38,530
A family?

6293
04:20:39,430 --> 04:20:40,150
Oh.

6294
04:20:41,590 --> 04:20:43,030
I'm listening.

6295
04:20:44,270 --> 04:20:45,990
Then heed my words.

6296
04:20:46,170 --> 04:20:47,670
For I will not repeat them.

6297
04:20:47,830 --> 04:20:48,010
Oh, okay.

6298
04:20:48,130 --> 04:20:50,150
On the green road to the north of Breville.

6299
04:20:50,150 --> 04:20:51,190
Lies the inn.

6300
04:20:51,730 --> 04:20:52,770
Of ill omen.

6301
04:20:52,890 --> 04:20:53,470
Okay.

6302
04:20:53,590 --> 04:20:54,170
Very inconspicuous.

6303
04:20:54,170 --> 04:20:56,570
Then you will find a man named Rufio.

6304
04:20:57,130 --> 04:20:58,530
Kill him.

6305
04:20:58,990 --> 04:21:01,430
And your initiation into the Dark Brotherhood.

6306
04:21:02,130 --> 04:21:02,550
Will.

6307
04:21:03,190 --> 04:21:03,450
Be.

6308
04:21:03,750 --> 04:21:04,270
Complete.

6309
04:21:05,590 --> 04:21:06,270
Do this.

6310
04:21:06,550 --> 04:21:10,290
And the next time you sleep in a location I deem secure.

6311
04:21:10,830 --> 04:21:13,230
I will reveal myself once more.

6312
04:21:13,690 --> 04:21:14,110
Bearing.

6313
04:21:14,290 --> 04:21:15,130
The love.

6314
04:21:15,630 --> 04:21:16,990
Of your new family.

6315
04:21:16,990 --> 04:21:17,070
currently.

6316
04:21:20,230 --> 04:21:22,170
Rufio will die by my hand.

6317
04:21:22,970 --> 04:21:24,330
But I'm no murderer.

6318
04:21:30,610 --> 04:21:31,790
Slow welcome to membership.

6319
04:21:32,010 --> 04:21:32,470
Thank you.

6320
04:21:41,040 --> 04:21:42,560
Is this a cult?

6321
04:21:45,660 --> 04:21:47,760
Rufia will die by my hand!

6322
04:21:48,540 --> 04:21:48,600
Excellent.

6323
04:21:49,440 --> 04:21:53,840
Now please, accept this token from the Dark Brotherhood.

6324
04:21:54,100 --> 04:21:59,600
It is a virgin blade and thirsts for blood.

6325
04:22:00,180 --> 04:22:02,900
May it serve your endeavors well.

6326
04:22:02,900 --> 04:22:06,180
Now, I bid you farewell.

6327
04:22:06,660 --> 04:22:09,360
I do hope we'll meet again soon.

6328
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:10,560
Soon.

6329
04:22:11,140 --> 04:22:13,520
Oh, um, what is the Night Mother?

6330
04:22:13,960 --> 04:22:17,080
We praise our unholy matron.

6331
04:22:17,240 --> 04:22:17,600
Ryoko!

6332
04:22:18,300 --> 04:22:19,380
Welcome to membership, thank you.

6333
04:22:19,940 --> 04:22:24,280
From her breast, we suckle malice and pain.

6334
04:22:24,520 --> 04:22:24,900
Wow!

6335
04:22:25,320 --> 04:22:27,680
She loves her children, you see.

6336
04:22:27,900 --> 04:22:29,960
This guy's VA is insane too.

6337
04:22:30,260 --> 04:22:30,580
Damn!

6338
04:22:30,580 --> 04:22:31,580
Wow!

6339
04:22:31,960 --> 04:22:33,600
I'm so glad I joined the Dark Brotherhood.

6340
04:22:33,600 --> 04:22:35,040
Have you not heard of the Dark Brotherhood?

6341
04:22:35,140 --> 04:22:35,340
No.

6342
04:22:35,660 --> 04:22:38,980
Of the remorseless guild of paid assassins and homicidal cutthroats.

6343
04:22:39,600 --> 04:22:44,020
Join us, and you'll find the Dark Brotherhood to be all that and so much more.

6344
04:22:44,220 --> 04:22:48,700
We are, more than anything, a union of like-minded individuals.

6345
04:22:49,800 --> 04:22:54,800
We kill for profit, for enjoyment, and for the glory of the dread father Scythus.

6346
04:22:54,800 --> 04:22:56,040
Scythus.

6347
04:22:56,220 --> 04:23:00,620
We are family, with bonds forged in blood and death.

6348
04:23:01,320 --> 04:23:02,760
And death.

6349
04:23:04,300 --> 04:23:05,220
Speaker?

6350
04:23:05,700 --> 04:23:05,840
Yes.

6351
04:23:06,540 --> 04:23:10,580
I am a speaker, a representative of the Dark Brotherhood.

6352
04:23:11,060 --> 04:23:17,440
My voice is the voice of the Black Hand, our organization's ruling body.

6353
04:23:17,440 --> 04:23:23,940
One of my duties is to find exceptional individuals, such as yourself.

6354
04:23:23,940 --> 04:23:24,820
I killed one guy.

6355
04:23:24,840 --> 04:23:27,700
And offer a place within our family.

6356
04:23:27,940 --> 04:23:30,820
I guess it's funny because bandits...

6357
04:23:30,820 --> 04:23:32,540
Nah, those don't count as people.

6358
04:23:32,900 --> 04:23:34,740
Those don't count as murder, but...

6359
04:23:34,740 --> 04:23:35,760
But killing a...

6360
04:23:37,040 --> 04:23:38,380
But the guard?

6361
04:23:41,140 --> 04:23:41,780
Uh...

6362
04:23:41,780 --> 04:23:42,520
Any rumors?

6363
04:23:42,800 --> 04:23:45,040
Dear sister, I do not spread rumors.

6364
04:23:45,280 --> 04:23:46,460
I create them.

6365
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:49,660
How about you?

6366
04:23:49,980 --> 04:23:52,360
Know that Rufio is old and weak.

6367
04:23:52,360 --> 04:23:53,060
Oh, Rufio I mean.

6368
04:23:53,220 --> 04:23:54,680
And sleeps his days away.

6369
04:23:55,140 --> 04:23:55,540
Oh, okay.

6370
04:23:55,740 --> 04:23:58,520
You could kill him before he even has a chance to wake.

6371
04:23:58,600 --> 04:23:58,920
Cool.

6372
04:23:59,260 --> 04:24:00,600
If you so choose.

6373
04:24:00,880 --> 04:24:01,820
She's messy.

6374
04:24:02,160 --> 04:24:03,180
Yeah, he is.

6375
04:24:03,560 --> 04:24:04,140
Okay.

6376
04:24:04,380 --> 04:24:05,740
Your path is clear.

6377
04:24:06,180 --> 04:24:07,900
Send Rufio to his death.

6378
04:24:07,900 --> 04:24:11,080
And the Dark Brotherhood will embrace you...

6379
04:24:11,080 --> 04:24:12,280
As family.

6380
04:24:13,080 --> 04:24:14,240
Thank you, Lucian.

6381
04:24:14,400 --> 04:24:14,500
Oh.

6382
04:24:17,480 --> 04:24:18,680
He's got stealth camp.

6383
04:24:18,760 --> 04:24:19,540
Wait, can I follow him?

6384
04:24:21,320 --> 04:24:22,500
Those aren't people!

6385
04:24:23,880 --> 04:24:24,360
Rufio.

6386
04:24:25,040 --> 04:24:26,380
First you join the Dark Brotherhood.

6387
04:24:26,540 --> 04:24:29,500
Then later you become a vampire and become the ruler of the night.

6388
04:24:29,660 --> 04:24:30,640
I could see it happening.

6389
04:24:33,020 --> 04:24:33,500
What?

6390
04:24:33,820 --> 04:24:34,760
That'd be crazy.

6391
04:24:34,760 --> 04:24:35,060
Crazy.

6392
04:24:36,440 --> 04:24:38,920
Well, he said he was only going to repeat that once.

6393
04:24:38,940 --> 04:24:41,860
I just remembered the End of Ill Omens.

6394
04:24:42,040 --> 04:24:42,220
Oh.

6395
04:24:43,640 --> 04:24:46,620
We'll have to remember that for next time.

6396
04:24:47,300 --> 04:24:48,520
Next time, next time.

6397
04:24:48,680 --> 04:24:51,880
I don't know for this game since it's kind of like...

6398
04:24:53,720 --> 04:24:55,800
I'm trying to decide how I want to stream it.

6399
04:24:56,900 --> 04:24:58,640
It might not be like a...

6400
04:24:58,640 --> 04:25:01,560
It might kind of just be like a when I feel like it kind of game.

6401
04:25:05,400 --> 04:25:05,840
So...

6402
04:25:05,840 --> 04:25:07,020
It's in the quest log.

6403
04:25:07,160 --> 04:25:07,660
Oh, perfect.

6404
04:25:09,740 --> 04:25:10,180
Quests.

6405
04:25:11,600 --> 04:25:12,040
Perfect.

6406
04:25:12,720 --> 04:25:13,160
Pilgrimage.

6407
04:25:14,520 --> 04:25:15,340
Oh, yeah.

6408
04:25:16,360 --> 04:25:17,240
Go see Anvil.

6409
04:25:18,080 --> 04:25:19,600
A knife in the dark.

6410
04:25:21,020 --> 04:25:21,920
Seeking your roots.

6411
04:25:22,060 --> 04:25:23,400
Oh, this is the Nern root.

6412
04:25:24,220 --> 04:25:24,480
Hmm.

6413
04:25:26,760 --> 04:25:29,160
Yeah, I think just kind of whenever I...

6414
04:25:30,100 --> 04:25:31,120
Feel like playing it.

6415
04:25:31,200 --> 04:25:32,320
I'll probably just be like, you know what?

6416
04:25:32,500 --> 04:25:34,320
I'm going to have my schedule this week.

6417
04:25:34,400 --> 04:25:35,060
Or something like that.

6418
04:25:35,160 --> 04:25:35,280
You know?

6419
04:25:35,340 --> 04:25:36,480
It's a slow, comfy game.

6420
04:25:37,760 --> 04:25:40,180
I've seen VTubers take years to play through this.

6421
04:25:40,180 --> 04:25:40,760
Hot dog.

6422
04:25:40,900 --> 04:25:41,920
Hot dog.

6423
04:25:43,300 --> 04:25:45,000
You did great for a first time player.

6424
04:25:45,140 --> 04:25:46,000
I hope you had lots of fun.

6425
04:25:46,020 --> 04:25:47,680
I have a feeling you like Dark Brotherhood.

6426
04:25:47,880 --> 04:25:48,200
Yeah.

6427
04:25:48,760 --> 04:25:49,240
Yes.

6428
04:25:50,160 --> 04:25:50,640
Yes.

6429
04:25:50,880 --> 04:25:54,800
We will join the Dark Brotherhood.

6430
04:25:54,960 --> 04:25:57,120
And we will cause mischief...

6431
04:25:57,640 --> 04:25:58,660
In the night.

6432
04:26:01,940 --> 04:26:02,420
Yeah!

6433
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:07,240
So...

6434
04:26:08,280 --> 04:26:10,920
Thank you guys for helping me out with...

6435
04:26:10,920 --> 04:26:11,400
You know?

6436
04:26:11,500 --> 04:26:13,080
I did get one guide a couple times.

6437
04:26:13,360 --> 04:26:13,580
But...

6438
04:26:13,580 --> 04:26:16,380
I feel that most of you guys...

6439
04:26:16,380 --> 04:26:17,280
Um...

6440
04:26:17,280 --> 04:26:18,860
Most of you guys tried to help.

6441
04:26:18,940 --> 04:26:19,920
So I really appreciate it.

6442
04:26:20,600 --> 04:26:22,220
The ETina build is awesome.

6443
04:26:22,940 --> 04:26:23,500
Yeah!

6444
04:26:25,220 --> 04:26:26,120
Thank you.

6445
04:26:26,300 --> 04:26:28,240
Yeah, let's look at ETina one last time.

6446
04:26:29,320 --> 04:26:29,880
ETina!

6447
04:26:33,870 --> 04:26:34,430
Also...

6448
04:26:34,430 --> 04:26:37,890
Didn't we set ET as like old?

6449
04:26:38,330 --> 04:26:39,590
So she's like...

6450
04:26:40,170 --> 04:26:41,590
She's got nothing to lose.

6451
04:26:42,350 --> 04:26:44,430
She's nearing the end of her days.

6452
04:26:44,690 --> 04:26:46,650
It doesn't matter if she becomes a murderer...

6453
04:26:46,650 --> 04:26:47,710
And an assassin...

6454
04:26:48,870 --> 04:26:49,390
And...

6455
04:26:49,390 --> 04:26:50,270
Kills for fun.

6456
04:26:50,530 --> 04:26:51,190
It doesn't matter.

6457
04:26:54,030 --> 04:26:54,550
ETina...

6458
04:26:54,550 --> 04:26:57,670
ETina wants to just feel something...

6459
04:26:57,670 --> 04:26:59,850
For the little time that she's got left.

6460
04:27:00,850 --> 04:27:01,370
So...

6461
04:27:01,370 --> 04:27:03,710
Have you heard of the high elves?

6462
04:27:04,030 --> 04:27:04,550
You...

6463
04:27:04,550 --> 04:27:05,730
Didn't you ask me that earlier?

6464
04:27:05,890 --> 04:27:06,190
None!

6465
04:27:11,210 --> 04:27:11,730
Nah...

6466
04:27:11,730 --> 04:27:12,250
So what?

6467
04:27:12,350 --> 04:27:12,810
She's 30?

6468
04:27:18,510 --> 04:27:19,030
Nah...

6469
04:27:19,030 --> 04:27:19,730
ETina...

6470
04:27:19,730 --> 04:27:20,270
ET...

6471
04:27:21,570 --> 04:27:23,850
ETina saw what happened with ET...

6472
04:27:25,730 --> 04:27:26,770
And decided...

6473
04:27:26,770 --> 04:27:28,230
Enough is enough.

6474
04:27:30,070 --> 04:27:31,110
I referenced...

6475
04:27:31,110 --> 04:27:31,410
The joke.

6476
04:27:32,090 --> 04:27:32,610
Oh...

6477
04:27:32,610 --> 04:27:33,930
Is it a joke?

6478
04:27:41,590 --> 04:27:42,910
Let's see her hair again...

6479
04:27:42,910 --> 04:27:43,750
Oh yeah, so true!

6480
04:27:55,780 --> 04:27:57,020
Oh...

6481
04:27:57,020 --> 04:27:57,500
Oh...

6482
04:27:57,500 --> 04:27:58,440
ETina...

6483
04:27:58,440 --> 04:27:58,980
You...

6484
04:27:58,980 --> 04:27:59,700
You...

6485
04:27:59,700 --> 04:28:00,780
I can't believe...

6486
04:28:00,780 --> 04:28:01,900
It looks...

6487
04:28:01,900 --> 04:28:04,040
Similar to ET...

6488
04:28:06,060 --> 04:28:07,980
I can't believe we actually...

6489
04:28:07,980 --> 04:28:09,520
Made ET...

6490
04:28:09,520 --> 04:28:10,780
You can look it up on YouTube.

6491
04:28:10,960 --> 04:28:11,900
Oh, I will, I will.

6492
04:28:12,500 --> 04:28:15,060
But also I want to experience a bunch of more of the...

6493
04:28:15,980 --> 04:28:16,420
Lines...

6494
04:28:16,420 --> 04:28:17,680
And silly things too.

6495
04:28:17,960 --> 04:28:18,460
I know...

6496
04:28:18,460 --> 04:28:20,340
I've seen like the mountain lion...

6497
04:28:20,340 --> 04:28:20,720
Like...

6498
04:28:20,720 --> 04:28:22,100
Clip where you're...

6499
04:28:22,100 --> 04:28:23,780
Getting attacked by mountain lions...

6500
04:28:23,780 --> 04:28:24,820
And then the guy's like...

6501
04:28:24,820 --> 04:28:27,200
Let's see if we can go find those mountain lions.

6502
04:28:30,680 --> 04:28:31,120
So...

6503
04:28:31,120 --> 04:28:32,940
You know, there's a few things that I have seen.

6504
04:28:34,040 --> 04:28:36,680
But there's also so much more that I haven't seen!

6505
04:28:36,980 --> 04:28:38,200
So I'm excited...

6506
04:28:38,200 --> 04:28:40,400
To experience it all for the first time...

6507
04:28:40,400 --> 04:28:41,160
With you guys!

6508
04:28:43,700 --> 04:28:45,440
Thank you guys for Oblivion!

6509
04:28:45,740 --> 04:28:48,040
Have a good day, have a good night, and...

6510
04:28:49,200 --> 04:28:49,680
Wait...

6511
04:28:49,680 --> 04:28:51,040
I'm gonna save...

6512
04:28:53,800 --> 04:28:55,400
I love ETina!

6513
04:28:55,700 --> 04:28:55,940
Yeah!

6514
04:28:59,100 --> 04:28:59,580
Otsumito!

6515
04:29:00,020 --> 04:29:00,640
Thank you guys!

6516
04:29:00,940 --> 04:29:01,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6517
04:29:01,900 --> 04:29:02,880
Have a good day, have a good night!

6518
04:29:04,040 --> 04:29:04,840
Bye bye!

6519
04:29:05,260 --> 04:29:05,640
Bye bye!

6520
04:29:05,640 --> 04:29:06,000
Thank you!

6521
04:29:06,120 --> 04:29:06,980
Thank you, thank you!

6522
04:29:07,220 --> 04:29:08,380
Bye bye, bye bye!

6523
04:29:08,520 --> 04:29:09,940
We'll get more into it next time!

6524
04:29:10,220 --> 04:29:12,560
Guy was kinda slow with the tutorial, but...

6525
04:29:12,560 --> 04:29:13,380
We'll...

6526
04:29:13,380 --> 04:29:13,960
We'll...

6527
04:29:13,960 --> 04:29:15,100
We'll get into it.

6528
04:29:15,740 --> 04:29:15,980
Yeah!

6529
04:29:16,400 --> 04:29:16,980
Bye bye!

6530
04:29:17,280 --> 04:29:17,800
Bye bye!

6531
04:29:17,800 --> 04:29:18,760
Bye!!!
