1
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,890
Welcome home.

2
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,010
Welcome home.

3
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,070
Hi.

4
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,960
It is I, the great Minky.

5
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,820
It is I.

6
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh, hiyao.

7
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,340
Hello, hello.

8
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,280
It's Ghost Made Minto.

9
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,580
Yes.

10
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,220
We are back with To the Moon, part two.

11
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,760
Part two, baby.

12
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah, we'll finish the game today.

13
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,850
I don't know, maybe we'll cry.

14
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,890
Oh, hey yo, oh hey yo.

15
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,250
To the Moon.

16
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,150
To the Moon.

17
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,210
Two of them.

18
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,470
Two of the Moon.

19
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,290
We're cloning.

20
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,990
The story's going to take a wild twist.

21
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,170
rather than going to the moon, they're actually going to clone the moon.

22
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,910
It's like, it's, it's, uh...

23
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,850
You know, meteor?

24
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,630
Like that.

25
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,230
We're gonna make the dinosaurs meteor.

26
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,670
We're gonna make the dinosaurs meteor.

27
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,930
Except this, it's like we're going to the moon.

28
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,390
And...

29
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,090
And someone says, yeah, we're going to the moon.

30
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:22,190
you're like no we're going to two of them the mood what's bro on about are you getting it crazy turn or maybe I've heard that this game has sequels which I don't quite understand how but maybe that's what happens in the sequel is

31
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,810
After going to the moon, you'd see on the dark side of the moon, there's been a second moon the whole time.

32
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,730
Actually, doesn't Earth have like a small little moon, second moon right now?

33
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,990
Spoilers?

34
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,650
My bad.

35
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,750
I don't know what she's cooking, but she's cute.

36
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,030
Bravo, Kojima.

37
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,650
For a couple months.

38
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:52,950
Yeah.

39
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:24,980
little while we have a second moon I wasn't paying attention you have two moons yeah just like when I say I have four cheeks thank you so much for the five thank you thank you thank you thank you two moons too furious I was thinking they could bring the moon down if he fails.

40
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,840
The astronaut exam.

41
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,900
Cloning the moon somehow feels safer.

42
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,580
We're gonna make Legend of Zelda happen.

43
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,160
We're gonna bring the moon to me.

44
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,000
Bring it here.

45
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
We're gonna bring it down.

46
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,180
Bring her home.

47
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,760
We're gonna make a big old crater for the moon.

48
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,020
Where should we put her?

49
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,710
Oh, sorry, I was yawning.

50
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,640
You're going to trigger a time loop then?

51
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
Oh my gosh, my favorite.

52
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
Humanity is doomed.

53
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
I got this.

54
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
I can tank it.

55
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
I've got a barn you could use for the moon.

56
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,900
Okay, okay, okay.

57
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,480
Okay, okay.

58
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,020
We'll put it in Neckowulf 583's barn.

59
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,000
The moon.

60
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,520
And if anybody has a problem with that, I'm talking to you, the tides of the ocean.

61
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,960
We're just not even gonna address the problem.

62
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,640
Are we ready to complete to the moon?

63
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,640
We'll get all the jokes out of the way, I guess, because the game is about to get super sad?

64
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe.

65
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Good day, Minto.

66
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,660
It appears I survived the super typhoon.

67
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,920
Let's go!

68
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,460
Thank you for personally protecting the Philippines.

69
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,640
Santo Minto.

70
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,460
You're welcome.

71
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,180
I did that.

72
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,680
Beware the phantom moon.

73
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,980
Callistry, welcome back to Memmoonship.

74
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,620
Everything is moon today.

75
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,980
We're ready?

76
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,120
It's moon in time?

77
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,760
Actually, that got my sister expelled from school.

78
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,680
She mooned her teacher.

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,280
The moontide is tugging on our hearts right now.

80
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,340
What kind of cheese is the moon made of?

81
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,280
Everybody says swish, but...

82
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,780
What, really?

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,680
Yeah, really.

84
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,520
Yeah.

85
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,360
She didn't... I don't know if she liked the teacher or not.

86
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,240
I can't remember.

87
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,320
But she was like, hey!

88
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,540
And then mooned him.

89
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,100
And she got in big trouble.

90
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,120
Wednesday is my birthday!

91
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,140
Scuba Gator!

92
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm sorry!

93
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,620
I'll just sing, but if you don't want to, but could you maybe tell me that the age of 38 is in demand that I'm not old yet?

94
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,740
Scuba Gator!

95
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,800
The age of 38 is in demand and you are not old yet.

96
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,960
Honestly, honestly, you can subtract like five years from that because of COVID.

97
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,840
So it's like you're not that age.

98
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,360
And also, it's how you feel in your Kokoro.

99
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
If you are young-hearted, then it's fine.

100
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, thanks.

101
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,720
And it'll just keep going.

103
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Is that how COVID works?

104
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,060
Dragon Slayer, thank you so much for the gift.

105
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,220
Sort of fulfilling his dream to the moon, we'll turn it into a nightmare.

106
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,600
Good evening, Mito.

107
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,240
Has anyone told you you're extra cute today?

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
What did I do?

109
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,460
What was it, the fries I ate earlier?

110
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,700
You are strong, we'll be proud.

111
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,740
Super Tomam, welcome to Mambushab Taku!

112
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,640
Taku, Taku!

113
00:10:29,800 --> 00:11:36,200
is doomed now humanity is moaned humanity is moaned on a phantom is just as freaky as minky yeah it does i guess maybe run in the family okay so last time let's give a brief recap last time we met we're we're a pair of scientists we went to this old guy's house and he's he's dying he's he's not gonna make it he's not gonna make it he's old it happens i don't know but he signed up for this program where they go into your brain and they give you like a false memory l grams i got old ones no no don't do it don't do it don't do it i promise you don't do it no thank you so much for the take after it thank memory of you accomplishing a wish.

114
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:55,760
So they go through all your old memories and then influence your past old memory self to push them forward towards a different goal so that ultimately in your more recent memories you have accomplished that goal while you're laying on your deathbed.

115
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,140
That's sketchy.

116
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,220
It sounds so morally wrong.

117
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,820
When you, like...

118
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,460
When you really say it, it sounds like so...

119
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,080
It's like a dying wish.

120
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

121
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,280
Thank you for the gift strangers.

122
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,380
Everybody's so generous.

123
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,620
Thank you guys so much.

124
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,940
I would like to offer you one last.

125
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,140
Before you hit the road tomorrow.

126
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,080
Thank you, Grandpa!

127
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,960
I will be bringing my stuff.

128
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,980
So, I will be able to stream more than I thought I would be able to able to.

129
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,380
I also was kind of worried since a lot of flights were getting canceled and stuff.

130
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,840
I was like, if I have to stay a couple extra days, I definitely would want to stream at the hotel.

131
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,980
So, um, yes.

132
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:01,980
So uh, uh, this, this, this, like maybe Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you'll get streams.

133
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,840
That's the plan at least.

134
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:12,400
So, they might be odd times, so I apologize in advance, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,630
My advice for the day, be cool like Minto!

136
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,370
Yeah!

137
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,090
So.

138
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,170
These are odd times.

139
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,770
Yeah, they are.

140
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,870
Tomorrow's my birthday!

141
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,090
General Dank!

142
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh my gosh!

143
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,010
birthday.

144
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,670
Oh my gosh, you're still around.

145
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,590
Thank you.

146
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,690
Stuck at the airport right now.

147
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,230
Oh, geez, I hope your flight's not delayed so much.

148
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,270
So far, so far it says it's okay.

149
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,790
So I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

150
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,590
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

151
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,810
But what I was saying, so they do these things where they implant the false memory or whatever and fulfill your dying wish.

152
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:33,890
but but it's not working for some reason and we turned into little wisps and we had to do a bunch of move but connecting connecting the dots for some reason it didn't work so we're figuring that out that's where we ended hello me though hello since 15 minutes ago I'm officially another year older probably not that much wiser.

153
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,270
Thanks for being here.

154
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:43,490
You generally, genuinely, genuinely an inspiration and the community you've built is a major positive part of my everyday life.

155
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,210
Lots of love.

156
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,690
Nashi, happy birthday!

157
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,230
Happy birthday!

158
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,150
Thank you so much!

159
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,470
Well, then we shouldn't waste any more time.

160
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,210
It's not like you're getting any younger.

161
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,790
Let's do the game.

162
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,910
Let's go back in.

163
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:37,590
why is it so scary okay so we figured we don't know why it's not working we don't know why let's see to the moon darling we have planted like all these things like hey we'll go watch this movie about going to the moon and all this stuff my birthday's in like two months can I get a happy birthday too I feel Brayden,

164
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:37,970
no!

165
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,710
Don't be...

166
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,570
Don't be hasty.

167
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,070
I will see you in two months.

168
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,290
To the moon!

169
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,450
Maybe it's a bad movie, right?

170
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,150
Ooh, Henry!

171
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,930
Dear Lord, I'm way too tired and hungry to be constructing movies.

172
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,150
Guess I should go see if anything's changed with John.

173
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,510
Yeah, it's a bad movie, I think.

174
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,370
Sorry for making you sit through this, buddy.

175
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,150
Oh.

176
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,940
So it was a bad movie.

177
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,660
Need to check on John.

178
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,090
It's all the same.

179
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,430
He hasn't gone to the moon even once.

180
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,950
I'll have to try igniting it somewhere else then.

181
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,870
This is ridiculous.

182
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,110
How dare he see one movie once about...

183
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,510
Okay.

184
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,830
You know...

185
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,890
As a kid, though, you do get really easily influenced about these kinds of things.

186
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,650
You'll, like, see a movie about, like...

187
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,450
See animals and you'll be like, I'm gonna be a marine biologist.

188
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,370
You know, okay, I get it, but at the same time, 10 months of freaky ghost made.

189
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,310
Thank you!

190
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,030
My birthday's in 45 minutes.

191
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,510
Whoa, Sanga!

192
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,650
I wish you a happy birthday in 45 minutes, just tell me.

193
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,640
Lily?

194
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
Reach into your brain.

195
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,100
Oh, okay.

196
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,640
This is when he asks her out.

197
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,220
Perhaps something here could work.

198
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,620
I'll only go out with you, John, if you go to the mood.

199
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,160
That's what...

200
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,340
That's what she'll say.

201
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,180
I don't have time for her right now.

202
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,940
Okay, just kidding.

203
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,740
Implant the bees.

204
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,700
So did she throw an encyclopedia in your face?

205
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,960
Huh?

206
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,540
Did she?

207
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,780
Gotta eat dinner.

208
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,220
Okay.

209
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,480
See you after dinner.

210
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,600
Shut up, dude.

211
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,260
What are you guys doing here?

212
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,760
It's starting.

213
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,600
Let's go get a good spot.

214
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,080
What's starting?

215
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,340
Wait, I don't remember that happening.

216
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,460
Something must have changed.

217
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

218
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh, the children are going outside.

219
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,500
Hey, don't squeeze.

220
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,640
Wait, hold on.

221
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Who are these kids?

222
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Nobody.

223
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,280
We don't care about them.

224
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,580
We're going outside.

225
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,660
We've changed it.

226
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
We've changed the past.

227
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,420
Is it...

228
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,820
It's like a...

229
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,280
That's the auditorium?

230
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,480
So maybe a show?

231
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,140
Wait a minute.

232
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,460
This isn't a real change.

233
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,400
This is...

234
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,900
May I...

235
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,180
Oh, it's him!

236
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,220
Oh, gosh.

237
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,980
It's Neil.

238
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,960
May I have your attention, please?

239
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,080
As you know, I am a representative sent from NASA in all its glory.

240
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,640
Disney's actually done stuff like that.

241
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,540
Over a year before Finding Nemo, they put fun facts about fish in the bumpers on Disney Channel.

242
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,640
So that by the time the movie was being advertised, kids liked fish.

243
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,160
The subliminal advertising is crazy.

244
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,640
Hey kids, want to learn about a fish?

245
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh my gosh, though!

246
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,720
I learned about...

247
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,300
Oh gosh, what's the fish called?

248
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,500
Hold on.

249
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,340
I can look him up.

250
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
And I will remember.

251
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,280
It's a fish with a very tragic life.

252
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,480
Sad guy.

253
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,600
The tripod fish.

254
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,580
The tripod fish is so sad.

255
00:19:48,580 --> 00:20:20,600
oh my gosh someone else is also basically they're born and then they like have this like camouflage mechanism that allows them to look like a jellyfish but then they lose that for some reason and then they start sinking to the bottom of the ocean and their limbs start extending like they start growing these like spiny looking things out their fins and they lose the ability to swim.

256
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,280
And they just have to stand still at the bottom of the ocean.

257
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,780
And so that makes them really popular to like parasites too.

258
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,760
And they're already at the bottom of the ocean.

259
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,780
Unable to move much.

260
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,620
And there's not much food down there for them to eat.

261
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
And it's just horrible.

262
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,480
I don't understand why it evolved like that.

263
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,680
Like what?

264
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,080
Why?

265
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,440
Why?

266
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,020
Evolutionary...

267
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,020
Evolutionary...

268
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,400
Disinvantages.

269
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,280
Disinvantages, yes.

270
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,130
It's quite strange, but it's also very fascinating, and they're very cute, I think.

271
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,150
I would look them up, the tripod fish.

272
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,150
Greenland sharks are basically Dark Souls lore.

273
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:17,670
Oh no!

274
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,050
I'm gonna have to look that up later.

275
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,590
Okay, back to game, sorry.

276
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,490
And I'm here to tell you all about it!

277
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,030
Okay, we're learning about NASA!

278
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,710
Let's go.

279
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,970
Hit it, Timmy!

280
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,590
Oh, oh.

281
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,470
Oh, okay.

282
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,490
Wow, that was terrible.

283
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,290
But I digress.

284
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,830
Anyway.

285
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,030
Anyways, I know that many of you are wondering.

286
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:55,050
What chances do slash have of doing something as awesome as adventuring in another realm?

287
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:13,330
Venus to swim counterclockwise through the rings of Saturn or perhaps just chilling at the backside of the man Oh, that was an italicized eye

288
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:34,160
Oopsie I thought it was a timeout I

289
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,140
thought it was a typo.

290
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,340
Because what chances do...

291
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,300
What chance do slash have?

292
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:57,660
Wait, no, it was like, What chance do slash have?

293
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,850
Worst letter, do I italicize?

294
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,290
I agree, like at least make it lowercase and not an...

295
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,890
Do slash have

296
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:44,990
It does make total sense Anyway Well here at NASA we believe that enough will Everyone has the potential It could be you Or you No it's not going to be any of these kids or perhaps You But I don't want to go to the moon.

297
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,370
Then you're in love.

298
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,950
Wait, what?

299
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:52,950
Why not?

300
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,070
Why should I?

301
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
Thank you so much for that 20 get that.

302
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,900
Thank you!

303
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm trying to, like, read your name.

304
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,760
No.

305
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
No name.

306
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,780
Thank you.

307
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm happy here on Earth as it is.

308
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,940
Well, don't you want to go there even a little bit?

309
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,420
No, why?

310
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,360
Not even a tiny bit?

311
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,160
Um, no?

312
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,140
This kid's stubborn.

313
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,920
Well, as an official NASA recruiter, I shall go over some facts about the moon.

314
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay, I think if all else fails, you just kidnap him in the dream.

315
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,980
And then, he is forced to go to the moon.

316
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,180
To start off, the moon is 4.5 billion years old.

317
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
This kid kind of sucks.

318
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,660
And did you know that its surface is about as big as Africa?

319
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,260
Emissary Zero and to the moon lore has some connection?

320
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Oh, maybe.

321
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,640
It's true.

322
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,200
In fact, if you try to bike around the moon, okay, he's like giving all the boring facts.

323
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,640
Also, it takes 1.5247 seconds for light to travel to the moon from here.

324
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,400
And if you drive a flying car, it takes 130 days.

325
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,080
I knew that.

326
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,480
No, you didn't.

327
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,720
And last but not least, people who go to the moon get rich and famous!

328
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,300
Good luck!

329
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
Good luck with your exam!

330
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,800
Good luck with your exam.

331
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,140
And we all know that rich plus famous equals groupies.

332
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,800
So, that concludes my presentation.

333
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,980
Remember, NASA welcomes any of you, especially if you're a brunette.

334
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,620
Abduction to the moon.

335
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

336
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,540
That was terrible.

337
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,520
Well, what did you think?

338
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,820
NASA probably wouldn't hire you, but I suppose it was blatant enough for this.

339
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,360
Hmm, I do try pretty hard.

340
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,040
Are you gonna go see if that worked?

341
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,300
Of course.

342
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,400
Be right back.

343
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,120
Back.

344
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Report.

345
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,320
Utter failure.

346
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,500
Deuce?

347
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,820
Is that how you spell that?

348
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,180
Hey, don't get discouraged.

349
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,360
I'm sure there are still things to be done.

350
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,400
Such as...

351
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,840
Well?

352
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,180
Thank

353
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,110
you, guys.

354
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,470
I can't afford to finish building this house, Isabel.

355
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,970
They can barely afford...

356
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,070
But you can't afford the Lunar Trip Lottery!

357
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,510
If you sell this house, you sure can!

358
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,350
Oh my god.

359
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,550
This is not a horror game, though.

360
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,810
Yes, in fact, we rarely have any...

361
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,450
Did you know that NASA has excellent healthcare plans?

362
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:24,570
It's true!

363
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,430
For both you and your spouse.

364
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,210
Free pony rides in space!

365
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,550
What are they doing?

366
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,690
Oh look, a wedding!

367
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,330
Good for you!

368
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,990
But here's a riddle.

369
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,110
Guess where you should go for your honeymoon.

370
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,410
Why are they doing that?

371
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,110
doing this.

372
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,430
NASA doesn't have parties anymore because they just can't find the time to plan it.

373
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,190
Hey Kiki!

374
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,890
Oh my gosh!

375
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,450
Hi.

376
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,710
River?

377
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,650
Isn't this like the traumatizing moment where she finds all the bunnies?

378
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,330
Oh my gosh.

379
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,370
Dagnabbit.

380
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,010
Glass.

381
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,610
Slippery.

382
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,070
Johnny.

383
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:15,450
John.

384
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:15,970
John.

385
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,400
What the cucumber?

386
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,650
You know what?

387
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,050
This just isn't working.

388
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,530
It's more than just not working.

389
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,210
It's ridiculous.

390
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,570
We're freaking professionals.

391
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,890
We're freaking professionals.

392
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,390
I didn't sign up for the job to run around yelling at him like an idiot.

393
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,570
What the cucumber?

394
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,130
He didn't?

395
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,430
Look, maybe this lack of sleep's getting to us.

396
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,090
Had I known that we'd be...

397
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,690
We'd be an all-nighter.

398
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,470
I would have brought coffee.

399
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,290
I agree.

400
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,830
You should have seen the movie I constructed earlier.

401
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,390
What movie?

402
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,130
Exactly.

403
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,590
Anyway.

404
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,970
As valuable as time is here, this just isn't going anywhere like this.

405
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,070
Let's take a break till morning.

406
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,230
Hopefully Johnny can hang on till then.

407
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,890
Contagious yawns.

408
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,610
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,090
I'm the most if...

410
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,570
Oh, no, don't say yawn.

411
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,370
If someone says yawn, I yawn.

412
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,950
If someone yawns, I yawn.

413
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:39,950
I'm the worst at the... I... I literally will read the word yawn and I will yawn.

414
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,630
I'm the worst when it comes to contagious yawns.

415
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,070
I do have some calls to make.

416
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,490
I'm not gonna look at chat.

417
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,270
I see you guys.

418
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,570
I see you guys saying the word.

419
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,040
That wasn't a yawn, I was stretching my face.

420
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,630
Silently yawning?

421
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,230
When my cat...

422
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,110
When my cat yawns, I say that she's silently yelling at me.

423
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,410
She'll be like...

424
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,070
I'm like, why are you silently?

425
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,570
Don't stop yelling at me!

426
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,650
It doesn't make sense.

427
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,790
Why did the machine have no effect?

428
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,330
Johnny's registered wish to go to the moon was successfully transferred.

429
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,750
There wasn't even a trace of him wanting to go to the moon after the transfer.

430
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,330
Stop saying, Yon, please.

431
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,110
Unless...

432
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,530
Unless a secondary condition for the desire was changed in the process.

433
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,560
Only then, would the same desire produce two different outcomes at two different points in time.

434
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,210
I can't stop yawning!

435
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm gonna smack myself awake.

436
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,740
Talk about yines.

437
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,240
If I could be yon, no yon!

438
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,900
No yon!

439
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,310
Someone kept telling me to go to the moon, I'd be off to the moon.

440
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:42,990
I'm right!

441
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,070
There's no denying that River played an important role through it all.

442
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,010
If there's anything that could have caused the core to change, she would be the top suspect.

443
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,160
But out of all things, what exactly caused it?

444
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,200
Just what exactly did you do?

445
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,250
Four-letter word that rhymes with brawn?

446
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,730
Prawn!

447
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,950
That's five letters.

448
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,260
Lawn!

449
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,220
Ah, the sun's rising.

450
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,580
I thought you were supposed to sleep!

451
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,480
What are you doing awake?

452
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,600
We don't have much time left.

453
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,200
Guys, we don't have much time left!

454
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,440
I wonder if Neil came up with anything.

455
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,670
I think it all has to do with river.

456
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,810
I think, I think, I think.

457
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,150
It was her dream or something.

458
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,370
Oh,

459
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:35,480
you can smell that squirrel And Yale ran over from all the way here now No, the squirrel Squirrel Squirrel Squirrel

460
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,880
Squirrel Oh, I'm going upstairs

461
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,180
Hello?

462
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:51,940
Hello?

463
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,040
How is John doing?

464
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,060
Barely hanging on.

465
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,320
What are you two doing?

466
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,720
We just...

467
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,600
We just couldn't make any progress.

468
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,220
You'd better soon.

469
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,180
We don't have long.

470
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,780
If you're looking for your colleague...

471
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,720
I think he's in the kitchen.

472
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,420
Oh, okay.

473
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,200
Thank you.

474
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,280
The kitchen is here.

475
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,760
No, I understand that part, but...

476
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,200
Okay.

477
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
Did you confirm it in his records?

478
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,380
The bunny!

479
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:46,260

She...

489
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,500
She...

490
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:41,640
She...

491
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,200
We can talk to her?

492
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:42,760
Ask her?

493
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,140
Oh.

494
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,520
Nope.

495
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,740
Still about the phone call.

496
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,280
Anything down here?

497
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,220
No.

498
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,020
Bone o'clock!

499
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,320
Oh yeah, baby.

500
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,760
If we can go to the basement, I suppose?

501
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,060
Um.

502
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,380
Oh.

503
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,180
But ma!

504
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,200
I don't wanna go to school.

505
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,980
It's Sunday, dear.

506
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,940
Shh.

507
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,760
Let them sleep.

508
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,020
Everybody's shushing me.

509
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,580
Can't speak at all to anybody.

510
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm gonna turn the lights on.

511
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,120
Turn it off, you giant doofus.

512
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,980
No.

513
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,300
Look at them asleep!

514
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,640
It's kind of cute.

515
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,420
They're like heavy asleep.

516
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:38,770
Oh, yeah!

517
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,110
This is the Twilight book.

518
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,850
Read passage.

519
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,390
Please!

520
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:41,990
No!

521
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,950
Why won't you let me?

522
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,550
They want to silence me.

523
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,770
Is the light still on?

524
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,630
Oh my god.

525
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,860
What are you doing?

526
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,760
What are you doing?

527
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,480
I really should have watched those two last night.

528
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,480
They were up late.

529
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:11,700
Well, it's not an everyday circumstance i suppose oh was there something you wanted to ask

530
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:37,080
lily unless i guess we can ask everything so lily you know it's pretty unusual for someone like you to work here with two children and all i mean sleeping in light mode so means it will it will it's getting their eyes adjusted to the world it's really it's not that bad really there's a school bus that passes through here.

531
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,960
How did you even end up here?

532
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,060
Well, a few years ago, my husband passed away.

533
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,060
What happened?

534
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,900
Oh, don't even say that I'm sorry.

535
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,120
He was in the army.

536
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,060
They were the last batch to be deployed overseas.

537
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,640
Sorry to hear.

538
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,800
I panicked.

539
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,340
Our savings were low when the job market was grim.

540
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,940
Johnny saw my ad and offered me this job.

541
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,520
I accepted with gratitude.

542
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,640
peaceful too.

543
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,840
Help me with my grieving.

544
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,320
Doesn't the government issue grants to war widows to help them get back on their feet?

545
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,020
They do.

546
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,980
And eventually, I received aid.

547
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,600
But by then, Johnny was starting to have trouble on his own.

548
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,920
He needed my help.

549
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,760
Tommy and Sarah liked this place too, and so we stayed.

550
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,820
As for Johnny, he was glad as well.

551
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,410
We're going to miss him.

552
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,350
I think deep down, he really wanted a family.

553
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,810
Aww.

554
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,070
Johnny.

555
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,090
So what are you going to tell them about John?

556
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,410
I don't know.

557
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,610
I'll probably make something up.

558
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,750
But it's no use.

559
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,370
Kids are smart nowadays.

560
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,850
They'll figure it out.

561
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,270
Johnny.

562
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,570
I just wanted to pass down his ideas.

563
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,820
Oh.

564
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Might as well.

565
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,900
It's the nature of life.

566
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,880
There's nothing to hide.

567
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,520
Future.

568
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,240
This is your full-time job, isn't it?

569
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,080
What will you do when this is over?

570
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,740
What else is there to do?

571
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,400
Find a job in the city and live on, I suppose.

572
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,920
It's a shame, though.

573
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm going to miss Johnny in this place.

574
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Maybe I'll come back to visit every once in a while.

575
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,580
Oh, hey.

576
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:32,900
Yes.

577
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,580
Before Johnny fell unconscious, he told me that you two would probably be coming soon.

578
00:39:39,540 --> 00:40:07,140
said that he probably wouldn't get the chance at himself but but he wanted to tell you thanks for he wanted me to tell you thanks for him so thank you oh we haven't even done our done it yet though oh geez oh geez oh uh let's go down here maybe

579
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,540
into like the freaky room

580
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:31,100
so freaky broken music box anything else no Johnny what's this what do we have here?

581
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:42,180
cabinet is filled oh that's right I think we checked this already I think so I think so the music stopping makes it even freaky here, I think.

582
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,100
It suddenly feels like a horror game.

583
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,320
Maybe we check the car?

584
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,940
Better go see if Neil has any ideas.

585
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,540
Just kidding.

586
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,060
We go see if Neil has any ideas.

587
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Johnny just wanted to pass on his beans.

588
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,980
Uh-huh.

589
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,080
Oh.

590
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,960
Hmm.

591
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,040
What is it?

592
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,440
It seems like our little Johnny here has some hidden records from the old days.

593
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,960
Hidden records Hidden medical records to be exact Oh?

594
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,060
Apparently during his youth he was administered a large dose of enhanced beta blockers?

595
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,280
What is that?

596
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:53,300
The IPS And what luck they tend to have this little side effect on a curious thing called memories

597
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,160
Beta blockers Beta blockers Johnny didn't have a heart condition, did he?

598
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,700
Apparently not.

599
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,720
Which leads one to wonder.

600
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,580
If the side effects were intended to be merely just that to begin with.

601
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,200
And in such a large amount.

602
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,620
What?

603
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,180
Its impact on his memories at the time of administration must have been significant.

604
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,340
Huh?

605
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,460
You think that's what kept us out of his earliest memories?

606
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,140
Well, it's not the machine, I'll tell you that.

607
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,120
The Patriots?

608
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,040
The maintenance department yells at me for scolding them.

609
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,800
Oopsie.

610
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,660
So what now?

611
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,480
I know you use them at Project Zomboid to reduce panic.

612
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,400
I was just given the reconfiguration frequencies.

613
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,380
That should get us past the blockers.

614
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,340
And once we're in his childhood, it might finally be early enough to transfer his desire for it to work.

615
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:27,320
waiting for but just one thing what is it of course there's always that one thing in order sorry in order to activate the new frequencies we'll need a trigger bang bang bang pulled my johnny trigger something that exists strongly in the bridging inaccessible memory does anyone commented on this mgs1 background music only you rucks

616
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:38,170
And we'll need to give it to John for him to stimulate his memory internally.

617
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,310
But what do we know of that?

618
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,070
We've only gotten a glimpse of his childhood memories.

619
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,410
And even if we find a childhood photo or something, John's unconscious.

620
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:48,730
Yeah.

621
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,590
Back to square one.

622
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,870
In the soundtrack, this track is like one second long.

623
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:58,970
Bam, bam.

624
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,230
You know, this job hasn't been a pain in the earth.

625
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,750
arse for me since Nora's case last year.

626
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:07,210
Likewise.

627
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,770
What did Nora do?

628
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,010
This is killing me.

629
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,270
I'm going to get out to get some fresh air.

630
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:17,990
What did Nora do?

631
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,570
Oh!

632
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:20,970
Ahem.

633
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:21,990
Forgot my coffee.

634
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:27,970
Receive note.

635
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:28,990
Beta blocker.

636
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,390
The last paper rabbit river gave to John.

637
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:57,890
Bam bam It smells Quit barging in and out of doors Oh the roadkill Ava it smells I know it's your fault for running over it Wait Now the music is one It's like a little higher What's going on?

638
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:57,450
The children are still sleeping Wait a minute the one we were stuck at it was the same smell what are you two talking about the olfactory receptors are directly linked to the brain's limbic system Lily don't you see what this means what he means that smell is arguably the most effective sense for memory recall we can use it as the stimulant to bridge his childhood memories and the best part even though Johnny is unconscious he is still susceptible I think I'm missing some vital contextual info on this whole thing the dead squirrel is the key all right this is good this is awesome now you just need to go fetch a piece of the roadkill oh me why should I why should slash fetch

639
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,260
Why did I say slash before?

640
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,720
Oh my gosh.

641
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,880
You're the one who ran it over.

642
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,600
Exactly.

643
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,340
I've already done my part.

644
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,520
Oh, you miserable bastard.

645
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,980
Um, if it helps any, I...

646
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,720
Sorry, my throat doesn't hurt today.

647
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,300
For some reason, I have a cough, though.

648
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,020
I have a pair of gloves you can borrow.

649
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,960
Why just a piece?

650
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:52,500
would it be safer to bring the whole thing just throw it yeah grab the squirrel by the tail and throw it on his head we aren't really disposable gloves but that'll probably change after this thank you oh we've got our little gloves on that's so cute

651
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:04,260
i don't think i'm sick i think it's like uh maybe dust or something you know so no worries

652
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:20,500
la la la la oh this way i'm stuck oh oh my god the squirrels oh my god deja vu i think i've been in this place before

653
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:30,740
little squirrels little squirrels sorry i'm trying to say squirrels

654
00:47:35,320 --> 00:48:11,300
oh it's little body flattened like that I can't at least to stop smoking time to grab the kind of things this job gets me into a baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do it's not safe to just bring in a piece of germ infected roadkill like this there's a valve container in the car at least then make its odor controllable okay in there and over here right

655
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:33,950
here what's he doing staring outside were they not concerned about like landslides or anything or where are you going i i gotta go take a leak but the bathroom's right here

656
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,280
What a mess.

657
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,240
The crash shook everything up.

658
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,800
Let's see.

659
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
Is there like a dead body in the trunk?

660
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,920
Ah, here it is.

661
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,480
Valved container.

662
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,900
Now to get some of that dirty roadkill.

663
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,660
Okay.

664
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,880
Hand it over.

665
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,100
Contained roadkill odor.

666
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,480
Oh my gosh, it's just like like when they bottle up air and then they sell it.

667
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,200
What is that?

668
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,140
What do we throw?

669
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,120
What is this?

670
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,780
Pain killers?

671
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,580
What's so odd about that?

672
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,100
I carry I carry, like, my ingredients in my purse.

673
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,540
Hmm.

674
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,320
Uh-oh.

675
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,800
Is Neil sick?

676
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:52,950
I mean, it had to try and run out so that we don't see it.

677
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,630
Oh,

678
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:02,410
hey.

679
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,150
Did you get the roadkill?

680
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,570
It's ready.

681
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,630
Great!

682
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,550
Go set it up.

683
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,350
I'll be right back.

684
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:09,670
Neil.

685
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,410
These painkillers.

686
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,790
I think they are yours.

687
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:15,930
Hey!

688
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,010
May I ask why you are on them?

689
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,150
I wasn't going to tell you, but...

690
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,050
Oh, this is embarrassing.

691
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,210
What's wrong?

692
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,510
A few days ago, I walked into a concrete wall.

693
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,530
You just walked into a wall like that?

694
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,270
What can I say?

695
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,190
I was in deep thought.

696
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,430
You know how deeply I think.

697
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,510
These are some rather strong pills, Neil.

698
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,650
And it was a rather strong concrete wall.

699
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,990
For his IBS.

700
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,270
It is sus.

701
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,570
This is sus.

702
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,890
T'was a match made in heaven, I say.

703
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:03,910
Anyways.

704
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,590
You got the roadkill, right?

705
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,890
Let's hurry.

706
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,710
John's dying back there.

707
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,990
Aren't we all?

708
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,310
Neil.

709
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,150
You aren't...

710
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:13,950
Addicted?

711
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,250
Are you...

712
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,430
Are you kidding me?

713
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,270
I'd overdosed before I'd sink to that level of contrived mess.

714
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,890
I didn't even think about that.

715
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,510
Dang, just confronting him.

716
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,710
Are you an addict?

717
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,720
It's not a no.

718
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,940
Oh my gosh, you're right.

719
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,940
All right, give him this smelly squail.

720
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:46,640
Squirrel.

721
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,120
So when we get to that exact point, I will send the signal.

722
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,820
When I do, I want you to release the valve for about...

723
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,780
three seconds.

724
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,940
You might want to cover your nose, too.

725
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,580
Do-do.

726
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,440
About time you showed up.

727
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,140
Have you made sure the germs are sealed off?

728
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,320
Fully sealed and filtered.

729
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,780
Not like it mattered to a dead man.

730
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,960
He's not dead yet.

731
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,740
We don't want to give him an infection in his last days.

732
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,620
You should know that Johnny's condition is deteriorating fast.

733
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:57,680
this might be your last chance you two he hates that great flavor whatever you do in there good luck luck's the last thing we need what honestly does it do like I guess it makes them pass on peacefully but like if you fail who's gonna get mad at you Act 3 They shine their lights At the other lighthouses And at me

734
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:08,900
Welcome to act 3 Thank you Alright This was the soccer ball, right?

735
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,820
Let's go

736
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,510
Can I talk to anybody?

737
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,150
No?

738
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,390
Wait, wait, what?

739
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,010
Oh, they went?

740
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:23,350
Okay.

741
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,210
Is this the last act?

742
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,250
I'm not quite sure.

743
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,890
To think that this little thing is causing us so much trouble.

744
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,330
I just want to kick it to outer space.

745
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,610
I suppose all we can do now is to send the signal and hope.

746
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,230
Well, ready?

747
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,990
What if you turn the soccer ball into a moon?

748
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,090
Act 3 boss is tough.

749
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,130
Oh!

750
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,570
Sniffle, sniffle!

751
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:00,950
Something's happening.

752
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,470
Quick, send it again.

753
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,580
Uh-oh.

754
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,820
Uh-oh.

755
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,680
Doctor, something's wrong.

756
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,500
What?

757
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,580
Take over for me, Lily.

758
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,760
I mean, I would...

759
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,900
His condition has been destabilized.

760
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,740
Intake levels must be reconfigured.

761
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,610
What's happening to this place?

762
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,710
It's been destabilized.

763
00:54:33,750 --> 00:55:28,490
what get out of his memory now what are you talking about if the system doesn't restabilize soon the shock might permanently damage whoever's in here you've got to be kidding me why aren't you getting out then I can't Neil if both of us get out under this state all of our work will be reset there won't be enough time to redo all we've done before Johnny oh you freaking don't pull that contrived crap on me this ain't a movie and you're no hero you're just being a moron it smelled way too bad it smelled so bad he wanted to throw up but couldn't so he's throwing up in his brain then why are you being one too get the hell out of here screw that if you're gone they'll probably pair me with alistair do you know how badly he smells

764
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,990
Worse than the ruin kill!

765
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,930
Oh my god!

766
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:51,930
Damn it, Liu, this is what I get for helping you cheat through the entrance exams.

767
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,370
She's literally Dr. Watts, don't say that!

768
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,610
He's better now?

769
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:01,390
Okay, he's better now.

770
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,230
It's fine.

771
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,030
Everything's fine.

772
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,030
Poor Alistair.

773
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:04,970
I know, right?

774
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:06,590
Doctor?

775
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,290
Doctor?

776
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:16,320
I think we're okay for now Too potent

777
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:34,740
Oh Floody house But this is the same as before Oh and guess what Your carrot cake sucks Wait a minute Yeah and at the last Christmas party you

778
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:46,200
How do you mess up carrot cake Oh Oh, come on, let's go before that happens again.

779
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,280
Um, you know that I didn't mean to, you know, call you a moron, right?

780
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,840
You know that I did, right?

781
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,350
We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going, we're going.

782
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,950
Wait, so can I just walk on this now?

783
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,010
Is there a place to walk to?

784
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,200
Going down?

785
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,780
We're going down, down.

786
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,700
Then there's nothing around.

787
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,240
Maybe we go back to the ball after all.

788
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,840
I think so, perhaps.

789
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm just double-checking.

790
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,520
I think so.

791
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:33,900
Okay.

792
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:39,880
Where's the ball?

793
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,660
Oh, there it is.

794
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,560
Here goes nothing.

795
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,500
Oh!

796
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,780
Effort we ball?

797
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,840
Are we here?

798
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,260
Oh my gosh.

799
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,520
We made it!

800
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,660
Wow, I can't believe that worked.

801
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,940
So we actually made it.

802
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,160
But now I'm not sure if I'm going to like this place.

803
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,700
What do you mean?

804
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,180
Seems peaceful enough.

805
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,600
Neil, did you notice something odd in Johnny's room earlier?

806
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,540
Here we go.

807
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,440
Oh gosh, what?

808
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,160
Uh, what?

809
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,220
There was something strange in there.

810
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,740
Did you not see it?

811
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,760
Wait, I don't think I saw it.

812
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,000
I suppose not.

813
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,000
Never mind.

814
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,480
I just hope I'm wrong.

815
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,900
There was something weird?

816
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,700
Wow, that sounds fabulous.

817
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,020
I know, right?

818
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,280
You've got to take them there one day.

819
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,500
Okay.

820
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,560
The moon?

821
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,020
We've got to take them to the moon.

822
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,040
Sheesh, the time overlaps getting out of hand.

823
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,820
Look at how many of them there are.

824
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,680
It's like a zoo.

825
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,100
This is getting out of hand.

826
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,360
Now there's three of them.

827
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,760
Mm-hmm.

828
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,300
Let's check out soccer.

829
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,280
It looks like the ball is moving around on its own and he's just chasing it.

830
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,440
Oh, yeah, it is kind of...

831
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,320
Squail.

832
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,720
I just kind of like that.

833
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:40,680
Dun, dun.

834
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,640
Oh, wait, I didn't investigate.

835
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,780
Oh, geez.

836
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,640
Look at the time.

837
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,240
I'd better get going.

838
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,680
The store closes early today.

839
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,780
Oh, take care, Martha.

840
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,000
Say hello to the boys for me.

841
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,280
I will.

842
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,320
I'll see you around.

843
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,530
Well, this is the end of the road.

844
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,230
And you were saying...

845
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,270
Never mind that.

846
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,010
Maybe I was wrong after all.

847
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,270
I mean, this place.

848
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,690
It's so peaceful.

849
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:25,670
The only thing that exists in this memory that could do such a thing would be...

850
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:26,810
Shit.

851
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,390
Duh.

852
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,190
Wait, what?

853
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,310
We need to go back now.

854
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,930
Wait, what's going on now?

855
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,550
Just shut up and come!

856
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,210
Wait, what?

857
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:45,050
It's like jaws for real Don't reach out Okay I won't look anymore

858
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:55,390
I was noticing that he's playing in the street Does he get hit

859
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,510
No Oh my god he just stands there and watches it Oh my god

860
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,150
How fast did you pull out of there Lady!

861
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,150
I don't understand.

862
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:46,390
If he was unconscious.

863
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:51,050
How could we be seeing this when...

864
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,090
Seeing this here when he never did.

865
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:57,450
Still, I'm just surprised that he survived.

866
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,910
I don't think it's...

867
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,890
Okay, wait a second.

868
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,110
I think I made a comment on the bunk beds last time.

869
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:05,610
I think...

870
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,470
I think this is a...

871
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,690
Actually, he didn't.

872
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,410
Uh, what?

873
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,910
Didn't you see it in his room, Neil?

874
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,550
Johnny slept on a bug bed!

875
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,690
Oh my gosh, I called it!

876
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,110
Oh my gosh!

877
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:31,750
Joey!

878
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,050
Oh no!

879
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,100
Joey, can you hear me?

880
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,100
Joey and Joey!

881
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,990
Why did you hit Joey, ma?

882
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,510
Oh my god, this is...

883
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,930
Why did you hit him?

884
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,710
Joey, wake up, Joey.

885
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:57,790
Wake up.

886
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:06,550
Okay, I thought he was, like, self-inserting himself as the little brother, but I guess they were twins.

887
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,490
No, Joey.

888
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:14,110
How fast did she pull out of the damn driveway?

889
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,790
Even though they were young.

890
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,030
To lose a twin brother.

891
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,030
Not to mention how their mother must feel.

892
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,350
Doesn't have to be very fast.

893
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:29,770
What?

894
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,630
I guess that's true.

895
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,530
If you like just keep moving.

896
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:37,890
You know it's not like a.

897
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,230
Like it doesn't have to be like a.

898
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,250
An impact thing.

899
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,210
I guess it's like a.

900
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:46,890
Squash.

901
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,090
Maybe.

902
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:49,710
I don't know.

903
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:55,750
At least Johnny had the beta blockers erase his memories.

904
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,470
Not like he remembers it much.

905
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,340
Fuzzly unlinked.

906
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,260
Not erased.

907
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,380
Somewhere in there, the aftermath of those memories probably lingered.

908
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,340
What about their mother?

909
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,120
I don't think she took the beta blockers.

910
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,580
She seems to have gone a little cuckoo.

911
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,260
Aww.

912
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,780
Why are you saying like that?

913
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:29,650
At least I don't really think she called Johnny Joey.

914
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,270
Oh, I forgot about that.

915
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:36,390
I forgot that she was calling him Joey as a nickname.

916
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,790
And that he said it was like his great-grand- or his grandpa's name or something.

917
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,430
Oh, that's so bad.

918
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:52,110
But if she then takes Johnny for Joey, what about Johnny himself?

919
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:56,890
I don't like it here.

920
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,110
Let's move on.

921
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:01,750
Oh.

922
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:04,750
Note, Joey.

923
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,890
Seems like this wasn't the only memory unlinked.

924
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:08,570
Odd.

925
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,890
It's not putting up a barrier anymore.

926
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,950
Don't jinx it.

927
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,350
Oh, there we go.

928
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,990
Dude, you should totally give the series a try.

929
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,770
As a parent, this is my worst nightmare.

930
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,570
Trucks and SUVs keep getting taller and taller.

931
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:56,870
know i've seen like i've seen like tests where they do where they like put a child height like like figure or something in front of a truck and you can't see it you can't see it some of the trucks are so high you know we should all just drive k trucks and that'll solve the problem

932
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:10,490
true drive K trucks.

933
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,690
It's the same amount of space in the bed.

934
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,630
I think it's fine.

935
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,450
But yeah.

936
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:25,290
Yeah.

937
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:30,870
Sorry.

938
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,510
Okay, there we go.

939
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,970
I mean, really, it's just wicked awesome.

940
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,110
I've already plowed through three books straight.

941
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,310
What's it called?

942
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:42,850
Animorphs.

943
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,690
That's why he loves animorphs.

944
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:52,650
Oh my gosh, and that's why his mom gave him the animorphs as a...

945
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:55,450
As a wedding gift?

946
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:00,890
It's about this group of kids turning into animals to fight mind-controlling slugs.

947
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,210
Meh.

948
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,270
I don't like that weird alien stuff.

949
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,250
They should Minto-proof the trucks.

950
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:07,710
Yeah!

951
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,710
I seriously don't know if they would be there.

952
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,510
able to see me.

953
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,090
Why not?

954
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:14,910
It's great.

955
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,870
Instead of going to boring school, they get to turn into tigers and all big bad aliens.

956
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:26,490
They're all like, and then they pick up lasers.

957
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:30,390
And it's all pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

958
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,250
Stop that.

959
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:37,220
Just watch Johnny.

960
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,720
One day, I'm gonna be a famous rider.

961
01:07:43,100 --> 01:08:14,340
novel on the block and every kid will get my book for free beta blockers made them forget his brother but nothing could make him forget anamorphs I think Johnny sort of turned into Joey though because if he's saying he didn't like anamorphs unless he started reading it after you know his brother died I'll make us rich and buy both of you and my really big houses how would you get rich Give away the books for free.

962
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,320
Free for the kids.

963
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,660
The parents still have to pay you, of course.

964
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,080
Yeah, I'm sure the parents will be thrilled to give you money.

965
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,480
What, you're still mad about the other day?

966
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,740
Oh, come on.

967
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,200
I called first dibs on the train.

968
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:36,980
Fair and square.

969
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,440
What happened to your prize anyway?

970
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,620
I gave it away.

971
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:42,980
To a hobo?

972
01:08:43,100 --> 01:09:13,860

974
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:23,490
Listen, Johnny.

975
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,170
What difference does it make?

976
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,250
Who owns what?

977
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,030
Everything that's mine is yours, too.

978
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,870
Aw, you're a sweet little brother.

979
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,080
My...

980
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,640
Michael, happy birthday!

981
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:39,700
Happy, happy birthday!

982
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,560
I mean, we both get to play with it, right?

983
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,420
Yeah.

984
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:53,940
Right!

985
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,280
I mean, come on, you're my twin brother, dude.

986
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,320
You're like a part of me.

987
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:00,720
Oi.

988
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,680
Oh, oi.

989
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,120
Let's go confuse the neighbors.

990
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,900
Wait, in the rain?

991
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,580
Yes, in the rain.

992
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,440
Come on.

993
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:19,780
Animorphs.

994
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,000
Note.

995
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:32,940
Animorphs.

996
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,820
These two are not like Dante and Virgil at all.

997
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,620
is going to be what happened.

998
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,540
Some kind of carnival, huh?

999
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,580
What are the creepy scarecrow?

1000
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,480
Shall we look around?

1001
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,540
Oh, God, this part?

1002
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,560
Okay, I'm not looking.

1003
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,320
How about I look around and you just stand here?

1004
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,040
How about we continue speaking in the form of questions for the next hour?

1005
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,920
Quit blabbering and go already.

1006
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,120
Aw, you ruined it.

1007
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,400
Hello?

1008
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:08,260
Fruits.

1009
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,260
Fresh fruits.

1010
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,120
Bulls, oranges, and tomatoes.

1011
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,100
We got it all.

1012
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:12,940
Wait a minute.

1013
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,100
Tomatoes aren't fruits.

1014
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,720
Uh, yeah, they are.

1015
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,120
They are the ovaries of the plant and contain seeds.

1016
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,800
That's what a fruit is.

1017
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,640
But come on, tomatoes!

1018
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,120
We never ever refer to them as fruits.

1019
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,280
We who?

1020
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,180
I happen to enjoy cooking in groups, okay?

1021
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,280
Some of us take it very seriously.

1022
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,260
Whoa, what's going on here?

1023
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,420
Welcome and behold, the world's smallest ferris wheel.

1024
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,260
Can we ride it?

1025
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,760
Absolutely not.

1026
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,180
Does it even work?

1027
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,160
Absolutely not.

1028
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,240
Okay.

1029
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:56,520
Looks like someone just glued some chairs to a water wheel.

1030
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,620
Don't know, don't care.

1031
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,920
What the hell?

1032
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:06,430
I'm looking around.

1033
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,770
I saw them over there, by the way.

1034
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,650
I'm just looking around first.

1035
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,730
Ooh, barbecue!

1036
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,080
requires three bars of memory okay just kidding wow i've never seen that before

1037
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,460
ferris and twill ferris and twill

1038
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:51,220
but i don't want this stupid toy i want the train that's the only train left do you want to exchange your prize for a teddy bear instead no i just want the train now now john don't make a scene.

1039
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,860
Joey won it fair and square, didn't he?

1040
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,400
But I won, too.

1041
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,760
He just went first.

1042
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,520
It's okay.

1043
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,760
I'll let you play with it, too.

1044
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,180
See how nice your brother is, Johnny.

1045
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,200
Okay, you dumplings.

1046
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,560
Don't block the stand now.

1047
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,820
Come, let's go see what's over there.

1048
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm not a dumpling.

1049
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,480
Johnny's a bit of a downer.

1050
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,300
You know what?

1051
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,200
I'm going to call you dumpling from now on.

1052
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,680
I'm going to call you guys dumpling Dumplings, too.

1053
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,540
Dumplings.

1054
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:29,580
Dumplings.

1055
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,720
You're bluffing.

1056
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:40,340
Dumpling.

1057
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,380
Ah, yes.

1058
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,620
Fortunes of wonder are ahead of you.

1059
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,860
This one might become a lawyer, and this one a doctor.

1060
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,400
Oh, my.

1061
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,840
Come on, I'm getting both of your treats.

1062
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,880
Hey, where's my tip?

1063
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,200
Aww, she got both of them treats.

1064
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,320
Wait, where'd they go?

1065
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:05,540
Hello?

1066
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:06,860
Wait, where'd they go?

1067
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,480
Uh, I lost them?

1068
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:18,130
Uh.

1069
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,070
But I still...

1070
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,090
Play whack-a-mole.

1071
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:26,490
Wait, is it in here?

1072
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,860
I don't see whack-a-mole.

1073
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,180
Unless you're talking about that.

1074
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,560
Wait, where'd they go?

1075
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,600
Oh, here's the whack-o-oh, can I play it?

1076
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,520
Oh, here's the whack-a-mole.

1077
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,260
Hey, is that a whack-a-mole?

1078
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,540
Whack-a-wha?

1079
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,240
Whack-a-mole!

1080
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,220
You take a mallet and whack-mole's!

1081
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,180
Isn't that animal abuse?

1082
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,180
They're fake moles, butt head.

1083
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,600
That's how people blew off steam before FPS were invented.

1084
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:56,820
How primitive.

1085
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,820
Yeah, it's pretty ghetto.

1086
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,960
It's a game.

1087
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,640
Where'd you read about it?

1088
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,760
My grandpa was a fan.

1089
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:07,880
Wanna play?

1090
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,260
Just hit everything on the head?

1091
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,180
And you win!

1092
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1093
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,260
Yes, I wanna play.

1094
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,860
With my mouse.

1095
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:16,180
Okay.

1096
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,300
Oh, let's go?

1097
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,620
Oh, shoot.

1098
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:22,400
Oh, oh.

1099
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,040
They're too fast.

1100
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,540
I'm doing it?

1101
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:33,960
Oh, shit.

1102
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,160
Sometimes I...

1103
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,560
Oh, I clicked out of the game!

1104
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:37,580
Sorry, hold on.

1105
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,820
Oh, oh, no, no!

1106
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,460
My score!

1107
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:52,230
Stop!

1108
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,710
I won, though, right?

1109
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,370
Let's see now.

1110
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:04,450
Out of 42 total target appearances, you struck 47 times and made...

1111
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,390
38 successful hits.

1112
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,850
That's a 90% hit rate!

1113
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:16,210
Okay!

1114
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:18,910
Pretty good.

1115
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,870
It's your new record!

1116
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,950
Yippee!

1117
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,790
Seeds get degrees, baby!

1118
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,610
Where's my prize?

1119
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,210
Lame, I don't get to keep anything.

1120
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:38,270
Oh, whoops, here.

1121
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,060
What's going on here?

1122
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,120
So sparkly.

1123
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,880
I'm stuck on a bush.

1124
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,500
What's going on here?

1125
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:52,780
Oh.

1126
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,220
La la la la la la.

1127
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,620
This looks so fine.

1128
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,660
I want to go to a festival.

1129
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,310
Made mint March May.

1130
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:10,310
It's November.

1131
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,170
We want to go to the festival.

1132
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,330
Okay, let's go talk to them.

1133
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,980
Imagine if you went into a dying person's memories and came out with balloons and prizes.

1134
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:32,700
right?

1135
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,680
I can never understand you, Joey.

1136
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,680
How can you stand the taste of them?

1137
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,240
They're just so sour and icky.

1138
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,040
Sour and awesome is what you mean.

1139
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,560
Just try it.

1140
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,720
Nah, I don't even want to taste regular.

1141
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,680
The olives.

1142
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,200
Oh my gosh, he really did just become Joey.

1143
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,800
I don't even want to taste regular olives.

1144
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,860
You should try at least one, Johnny.

1145
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,140
Who knows, maybe I'll like it.

1146
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:05,780
Yeah!

1147
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,180
He got gaslit so hard!

1148
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,180
Nah!

1149
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,980
I'm done, though.

1150
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,080
Can I go play?

1151
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,500
Okay, but only at the playground and not an inch too far.

1152
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,420
Just leave that bag.

1153
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,320
I'll keep it for you.

1154
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:23,660
No, it's mine.

1155
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,820
I want it!

1156
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,180
Pickled olives.

1157
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,280
No stinking way!

1158
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,280
He didn't even like olives.

1159
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,040
What's he gonna give it to?

1160
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,960
What do you get, I wonder?

1161
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,340
Venom Joey.

1162
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,240
All things lead back to Metal Gear.

1163
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,600
Where's he going?

1164
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:57,990
Way to follow mom's orders, huh?

1165
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,080
Where are we going?

1166
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,980
Ooh, this looks like a date.

1167
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,720
Why does this look similar to...

1168
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:19,800
like where the what's it called is the lighthouse

1169
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:32,340
he's gonna get abducted wow don't reach out okay thank you

1170
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:53,830
birds whoa birds

1171
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,360
Wow, whoa!

1172
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,000
Well, okay, so he wandered off at the trail and found a cool place.

1173
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,740
Let's face it, he could have also been eaten by a pack of tigers.

1174
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,680
Tigers don't travel in packs, idiot.

1175
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,700
It was just an expression.

1176
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,980
You know, when I was a kid, my grandpa took me stargazing every year.

1177
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:27,880
Yeah?

1178
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,760
There was a hill outside of the city that we'd stay at.

1179
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,000
The same one every year.

1180
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,980
We'd watch the stars till daybreak.

1181
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,760
Well, I did mostly.

1182
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,180
He just carried the telescope for me.

1183
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,640
Of course.

1184
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,640
The thing was, though, Ma didn't want me to stay up late.

1185
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,040
Grandpa always...

1186
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,520
Why does everybody say ma?

1187
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:56,240
Grandpa always told her that we were just camping and hid the telescope inside the car.

1188
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,280
Well, you can't bring a telescope to the car?

1189
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,900
Or to camping?

1190
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,200
Their southerners must be the south.

1191
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:09,680
That's all good, but when we got back in the morning, I had to pretend like I'd actually slept.

1192
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,620
So in conclusion, that's the story of how I started my caffeine addiction.

1193
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,600
You're terrible.

1194
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:22,580
I know.

1195
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:24,880
It's a shame, though.

1196
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:29,700
Wow.

1197
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,900
All these nice memories lost and never found.

1198
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,560
And who knows how many more like it?

1199
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,340
Well, as you say, just take it moment for moment, right?

1200
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,620
Mm-hmm.

1201
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,480
Oh.

1202
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,380
I told you packs of tigers dwell here.

1203
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,800
What is it?

1204
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
Someone else walking.

1205
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,980
The tigers have shoes.

1206
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,300
Ah!

1207
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,460
Of course!

1208
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:02,840
River.

1209
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:14,790
Wait, don't go!

1210
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,790
Tiger, I'm Johnny.

1211
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:18,730
What's your name?

1212
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,130
They're at my spot.

1213
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:27,330
Their spot.

1214
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,170
She's mad at you.

1215
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:30,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

1216
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,430
I didn't mean to hog this place all to myself.

1217
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,890
Aw, Johnny's a little good kid.

1218
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,610
Um, you wanna join me?

1219
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,250
Watch the stars.

1220
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:42,610
Are you?

1221
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,140
Their first encounter.

1222
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:07,170
Oh.

1223
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:09,210
Oh my gosh.

1224
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:09,890
Wait, did we...

1225
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:10,970
We got a CG!

1226
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,870
Oh my gosh.

1227
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,390
Our first CG.

1228
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,070
Just look at them.

1229
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:23,490
It's a thumbnail.

1230
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,270
Did you know?

1231
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:35,510
There were so many lights in the sky Yes, oh, I did too

1232
01:23:39,950 --> 01:24:00,030
You said this was your spot right only during the carnival not a fan of the crowds Me neither you know you still haven't told me your name yet I'm not telling you everyone makes fun of it in school.

1233
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,770
No, but it's That's cute!

1234
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,010
Why?

1235
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:07,050
They say it makes them want to go to the washroom.

1236
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,470
Uh, okay then.

1237
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,690
Well, it can't be worse than John.

1238
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:20,470
I mean, everywhere in the world, nearly everyone's named John.

1239
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,410
Even in India?

1240
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,430
All those Johns in India.

1241
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,410
Probably.

1242
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:31,270
Wait, so he met her and then forgot about it, but still lied to her.

1243
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:42,010
when he met her again why didn't she ever bring it up then what's wrong with that

1244
01:24:45,090 --> 01:25:00,950
what's wrong with having a name that everyone has well it's boring i guess i mean if everyone has it then what's the point i wouldn't mind just for once to have the same name as everyone else

1245
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:06,290
It's like those lights in the sky.

1246
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,810
They all look the same from here, but that doesn't make them any less pretty.

1247
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:17,050
I suppose.

1248
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,350
River's name makes the want to go to the John.

1249
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,490
I could really use a wish right now.

1250
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:26,530
A wish right now.

1251
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:29,130
What do you think those stars up...

1252
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:31,490
Wait, what do you think those stars up there are anyway?

1253
01:25:32,850 --> 01:26:04,150
says they're giant burning spheres of gas oh I bet he's just making it up why would he lie to me because you know that's what grown-ups do they make things up Santa Easter Bunny kangaroos stuff like that I wish kangaroos were real have you ever made an Easter Bunny out of stars like a constellation Yes.

1254
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,130
Of the other things?

1255
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:09,570
Never tried a rabbit, though.

1256
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,570
Santa's not real?

1257
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:14,990
Yeah, you can't convince me that he's not real.

1258
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:19,430
Do you want to make one?

1259
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:24,370
Yeah, we'll make the fastest constellation ever.

1260
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:27,090
Let's see who makes one out first.

1261
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,750
Who makes one out first?

1262
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,030
Okay, we'll start in three.

1263
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,410
Wait, do I have to do this for real?

1264
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,150
Three, two, one.

1265
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,990
And I see it.

1266
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:43,650
Where?

1267
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:45,950
In the sky.

1268
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,870
But where in the sky?

1269
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:50,530
Think big.

1270
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:52,890
I'm trying to see the big picture.

1271
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:55,730
Bigger than all the others.

1272
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,490
Is it the bunny on the moon?

1273
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:03,610
Wait a minute.

1274
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:31,770
minute i see it tell me what you see isn't this how she would talk about the bunny the or the origami bunnies there right there's the two ears and head what else and there oh my god wait oh my gosh when she was doing that was she trying to get him to remember

1275
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:37,830
There, there's, there, it's two feet.

1276
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,710
Yes, what else?

1277
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:43,390
And the moon!

1278
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:48,850
The moon is its big round belly.

1279
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,180
So what do you think they really are?

1280
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,620
The stars, I mean.

1281
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:13,640
I...

1282
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,100
I never told anyone, but...

1283
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,580
I've always thought they were light.

1284
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:29,700
Billions of lighthouses stuck at the far end of the sky.

1285
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,680
Wow, it must be so lively up there.

1286
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,100
But it isn't.

1287
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:49,970
They can see all the other lighthouses out there, but they want to talk to them.

1288
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,370
Oh, and they want to talk to them.

1289
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:55,490
But they can't because they're all too far apart to hear what the others are saying.

1290
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:59,810
All they can do is shine their lights for them.

1291
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:46,050
a far so that's what they do they shine their lights at the other lighthouses and that me why you because one day I'm going to befriend one of them that bag what's in it oh no it's the prize I won from whack-a-mole did you get to play that game i tried but i'm too clumsy what did you get from it i got a thing i don't really know what it is it's the platypus it's

1292
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:54,530
some kind of a weird duck beaver thing may i see it

1293
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,120
It looks so strange.

1294
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,840
I wish I could win one myself.

1295
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:10,740
Eek!

1296
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,200
That's my calling.

1297
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,540
You know what?

1298
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,300
Keep it.

1299
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,000
It's yours.

1300
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:19,980
Mine?

1301
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,060
Yeah, I can always get another.

1302
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,080
I don't like to brag, but I'm totally the best at that game.

1303
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,420
Will you be here next year?

1304
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,560
Yep, will you?

1305
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,500
Same place, same time?

1306
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,300
Why did he jump like that?

1307
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,440
What if you forget or get lost?

1308
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,620
Then we can always regroup on the moon, silly!

1309
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,060
Right on the rabbit's tummy!

1310
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,720
Me, coming!

1311
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,040
Oh yeah, I forgot my hacky sack in the bag.

1312
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,760
You said you're clumsy, right?

1313
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,620
Maybe it'll help.

1314
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,280
Accusack.

1315
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:43,410
Because that was the one that she tried to like almost jump off the cliff for, right?

1316
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,690
If they ever get lost.

1317
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:58,810
Wait, does that mean?

1318
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,230
Don't tell me you didn't see that coming.

1319
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:06,830
And here I thought this was gonna be an inspirational childhood dream story.

1320
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:12,030
Maybe I should have known that some girl would come along and turn it into a cheese fest.

1321
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:19,690
I suppose now we know what we must do to send them to the moon.

1322
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:23,250
Wait, you aren't actually going to do it, are you?

1323
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,590
That's our job, Neil.

1324
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,230
It's what we are contracted to do.

1325
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:33,370
Damn it, Eva, wait!

1326
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:37,090
Eva.

1327
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:43,490
They just wouldn't be nice.

1328
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:44,610
On the moon!

1329
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,210
Uh...

1330
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:56,990
I know you are in here!

1331
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,780
Stop to it, Bladipus.

1332
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,780
This is all your fault!

1333
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,140
What?

1334
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,820
Wait, why?

1335
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,530
Scary music.

1336
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:17,070
Be-beam.

1337
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:18,610
Be-beam-beam.

1338
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:19,670
Oh, there she is.

1339
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:22,350
Turn around.

1340
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:29,230
I know what you are planning to do.

1341
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,170
I know that you know.

1342
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,010
Yeah?

1343
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,050
Well, I know that you know that.

1344
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,970
Look, our contract is to send him to the moon.

1345
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,310
And the only way for that to happen is if Johnny is motivated to do so.

1346
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,710
But if that means removing River, then what's the point?

1347
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:47,790
Yeah.

1348
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:53,110
The reason why he even wants to go to the moon in the first place is because she died.

1349
01:33:55,410 --> 01:34:27,170
bound by the contract to specifically screw the contract wait why would you i didn't take this job to make him miserable eva i don't know about you but i signed up to help the freaking geysers die happy me too and i like this job but if we directly go against our legal obligations we'd be in for court hearings we'll appeal we know that johnny'd be happier to not go to the moon There's a lot of alternate life tangents,

1350
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,510
Neal.

1351
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:29,010
Oh my gosh, wait!

1352
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:33,570
Why, why does she turn so bad?

1353
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,490
Why is Neal so good now?

1354
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:38,930
By who, who would sue?

1355
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:39,910
I know, right?

1356
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:41,530
How would they know?

1357
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,490
We're not here to play God.

1358
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:47,190
Our job is to give him what he signed for.

1359
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:50,590
Well, we happen to know what he wants better than he does.

1360
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:54,830
Look, I'm only risking losing River because I believe in her.

1361
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,490
What do you mean, risk?

1362
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,050
You're removing her!

1363
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:00,270
And besides, I will make up for it.

1364
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,350
Make up for it?

1365
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:01,650
How?

1366
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,030
Uh-oh.

1367
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,870
We're unstable.

1368
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,070
We're running out of time.

1369
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,310
Oh my god, no!

1370
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:10,890
Eva's choosing the mission.

1371
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:12,610
Just trust me.

1372
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:14,470
Oh my god.

1373
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:18,470
Says the one who pushed me off the freaking lighthouse!

1374
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,230
Already 19.

1375
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,090
Thank you!

1376
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,290
Did you just...

1377
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:25,390
Wait.

1378
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:25,890
What's happening?

1379
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:26,510
Oh my god.

1380
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:29,870
Freaking light data.

1381
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:33,630
Abusing your powers doesn't disable my controls entirely, Eva.

1382
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,990
Oh, now it's a horror game.

1383
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:38,070
Oh my god.

1384
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,710
Booby traps!

1385
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:40,550
Really, Eva?

1386
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:42,250
Just trying to buy some time.

1387
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:43,770
Gee, thanks for telling me.

1388
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:45,270
Oh my gosh.

1389
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:50,120
Oh my god.

1390
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,020
Oh my god.

1391
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:51,720
Oh my god.

1392
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,820
Those are some expensive pieces of equipment you're tossing.

1393
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,620
Seriously, just stay put.

1394
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,400
until I'm done.

1395
01:35:59,020 --> 01:35:59,960
Oh, piss off.

1396
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:00,640
Yeah.

1397
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,020
Wait.

1398
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,720
Look, don't make me exit this whole thing and unplug you.

1399
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,600
Would you really risk distorting his memories as they are?

1400
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,800
Just stop trying, please.

1401
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,820
This won't take long.

1402
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:14,780
Not again.

1403
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,360
Or come and find me at the end of the hall.

1404
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:25,050
Suddenly, oh, suddenly I'm playing like a real RPG.

1405
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,250
Baker game.

1406
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:29,850
What the?

1407
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:31,790
Oh my god.

1408
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:35,810
Did she create a zombie versions of herself?

1409
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:37,930
Is this a game to you, Eva?

1410
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,050
Zombie evas.

1411
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:45,610
Dear Lord, they aren't just zombie evas.

1412
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,010
They're zombie evas.

1413
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:50,190
Oh my god.

1414
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:52,270
Don't come any closer.

1415
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,310
I got plants.

1416
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:55,230
Wait, what do I see?

1417
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:57,910
Oh.

1418
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,990
What the heck?

1419
01:36:59,010 --> 01:36:59,730
What is happening?

1420
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,390
Oh my god, I'm subtly shooting.

1421
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:05,990
Oh, oopsie.

1422
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:06,250
Ah!

1423
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,750
How do I get up there?

1424
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,690
I go around?

1425
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,230
Oh, she's at the end of the hall, right?

1426
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:18,430
These things are good for something after all!

1427
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,610
Oh my gosh.

1428
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:22,630
Oh, oops.

1429
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:23,830
Oh.

1430
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:25,030
Oh.

1431
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:27,750
Oh my god.

1432
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:30,250
Oh, there's so many!

1433
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:30,790
Ah!

1434
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:31,510
Ah!

1435
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,730
Ah!

1436
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:34,410
Final boss!

1437
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,070
Ah!

1438
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:40,110
Why am I going through a looping hallway anyway?

1439
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,930
Oh my god, why are there boulders now?

1440
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:43,990
Oh my god.

1441
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,350
Oh my god!

1442
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:45,770
Oh my god!

1443
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,870
Oh my god.

1444
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,590
Oh gosh!

1445
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:55,870
Two steps forward, five steps back.

1446
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:12,400
Oh, screw this.

1447
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:13,620
Yeah.

1448
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:15,180
Oh.

1449
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:18,900
PT hallway.

1450
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,200
What the?

1451
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:29,260
I'm not sure if there's an actual time limit or not.

1452
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,770
So I go this way.

1453
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:36,210
Oh.

1454
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:38,070
Eva?

1455
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:38,930
What happened?

1456
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:40,510
Eva?

1457
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:45,540
I know.

1458
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,080
What character development?

1459
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:55,920
What else?

1460
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,000
Billions of light?

1461
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,460
is stuck at the far end of the sky.

1462
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,860
Now the whole construct's messed up.

1463
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:03,460
Oh my god.

1464
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,380
It did become a little bit like a horror game.

1465
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,740
Oh, what the...

1466
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,260
Oh, the bunny.

1467
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,340
It's finished, River.

1468
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,400
She won't be alone anymore.

1469
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,280
The lighthouse, Anya!

1470
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:27,240
What did they build to make her not lonely?

1471
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:33,020
I just don't want to be another typical kid and to see if typical people, Nick.

1472
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:38,630
What is it like?

1473
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:40,530
Just the responsibilities, I suppose.

1474
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:41,910
Oh yeah, after they got married.

1475
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:47,710
Is that what the home was supposed to be, the place I built?

1476
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:48,010
Oh.

1477
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,350
Oh, everything...

1478
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:53,030
It'll help you understand her condition.

1479
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:53,830
I'd rather not.

1480
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:54,730
Why is that?

1481
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:55,270
Why?

1482
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:55,670
Why?

1483
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:58,670
Everything's all freaky.

1484
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,430
Oh, gosh, it scared me.

1485
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:14,370
Oh, they're dancing together though!

1486
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:18,890
Let's jump scare.

1487
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,500
Emperor's new clouds!

1488
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:43,020
Hello!

1489
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,020
Wait, don't call!

1490
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,540
I'm Johnny, what's your name?

1491
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,460
Oh gosh, spooky.

1492
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,060
This is so spooky.

1493
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,680
Look, it was a long time ago.

1494
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,540
There's no date or time, Johnny.

1495
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:08,940
What's that mean?

1496
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,680
Oh, I'm in the dark.

1497
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,280
Oh, why is it so dark?

1498
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,520
Okay, we're fine.

1499
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:20,300
This is our game all of a sudden.

1500
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,780
Hello, Neil.

1501
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:25,860
Morpheus?

1502
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:26,980
What?

1503
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,520
It's Eva, you idiot.

1504
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:32,020
We're the only ones here.

1505
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,560
Listen, whatever you've been doing, stop it.

1506
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,520
Colonel.

1507
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:41,780
Minty is probably.

1508
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:46,880
We might not know what Johnny wants, but we know what he doesn't want.

1509
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,140
And what he doesn't want is exactly what you are accelerating.

1510
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,100
It's already done, Neil.

1511
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,380
Why don't you come out now?

1512
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:21,310
What?

1513
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:23,930
Oh, the shadow people took her away.

1514
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,410
What color are those pain pills, Neal?

1515
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:29,890
I know, right?

1516
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,130
Silent Hill F up here.

1517
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,790
What did you do to her?

1518
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,510
Relax, she's merely going somewhere else.

1519
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:51,770
You know, it's one thing to disable by control is to feed me some olives.

1520
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:54,390
But this is way out of line.

1521
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:59,270
I'm sorry, but this just won't go anywhere if you keep on resetting the memory.

1522
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:02,650
At this point, this is the only way.

1523
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:05,370
asking you to trust me.

1524
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:09,050
So please, just calm down and wait here.

1525
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:13,190
I don't understand why they couldn't...

1526
01:43:15,410 --> 01:43:17,890
They brought back his older memories.

1527
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:22,190
So, like, why couldn't they just have him remember that?

1528
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,830
And then it would make him want to go to the moon.

1529
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:35,130
Or, like, if they can alter memories at all, why don't they make it so that he remembers the...

1530
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:37,810
earlier stuff and then forgets about his brother still or something.

1531
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:38,830
I don't know.

1532
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:52,770
Does it have to be linked?

1533
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:53,530
Is that the thing?

1534
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,360
Please just calm down and wait here.

1535
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:03,280
Then just pull the trigger already.

1536
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,180
Where are you going?

1537
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,840
Yeah, let's find out!

1538
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,400
There's just one last thing I need to do.

1539
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,140
Poser.

1540
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,480
There's no need to visualize a door.

1541
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,760
What's with all this melodrama, Neil?

1542
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,640
waiting so hard for this.

1543
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,720
Forget it.

1544
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,880
There's no time.

1545
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,930
Everything will be alright, man.

1546
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:32,710
Just turn around.

1547
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:34,070
Okay.

1548
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:35,430
Okay.

1549
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:37,610
Hey, what are you?

1550
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:39,810
Oh, she's not there.

1551
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,490
Ahem, hello!

1552
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:55,990
Sorry, kid.

1553
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,000
It's already started.

1554
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:06,920
Come

1555
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:15,670
on, they're going to hog all the good tables.

1556
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:17,630
They're all the same.

1557
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:19,250
Sheesh.

1558
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:19,790
Aw.

1559
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:22,130
Aw.

1560
01:45:23,470 --> 01:45:23,770
Uh.

1561
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:26,730
Joey's right.

1562
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:28,830
The ones by the kitchen smell better.

1563
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:30,110
Totally.

1564
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:32,590
And all the refills are just steps away.

1565
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,710
Ah, olives.

1566
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,430
Saving him doesn't justify it.

1567
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:59,730
another river Neil she completely forgot the point of why he wanted to go to the moon you

1568
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:28,150
if I doing this you essentially kill another person but he'll only have one brother come on we're in the way it is not reality that's true but it's like his reality it's it's his memories and all

1569
01:46:32,800 --> 01:47:46,760
short steps whoa vocals chin up I can't step into the spotlight she said I'm sad somehow without any words I just stood there searching for an answer when this world is no more the moon is all we'll see don't say astronaut to fly away with me until the stars all fall down the sky but if you're with me then everything's all right oh my god the nasa poster

1570
01:47:56,180 --> 01:48:12,600
why do my words always lose their meaning what i feel what i say there's the one who won this time

1571
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,700
They don't even go to the carnival.

1572
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,680
I just stood there.

1573
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,620
Never know what I should do.

1574
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:41,480
When this world is no more, the moon is all we'll see.

1575
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:56,080
I'll ask you to fly away with me Until the stars all fall down Whoa!

1576
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,440
They empty from the sky He became the author!

1577
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,060
He's like he's wanted to If you're with me He's bro Animorphs!

1578
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,020
Everything's alright

1579
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,670
with me.

1580
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,380
Nanomorphs too.

1581
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:23,380
Oh.

1582
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,140
NASA!

1583
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:58,110
He actually made it, huh?

1584
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:02,010
You sound surprised.

1585
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:05,830
Whatever happened to, we always succeed because we are awesome.

1586
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,790
To the moon, I guess.

1587
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:11,830
This isn't a success.

1588
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:13,810
Oh, lighten up.

1589
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,610
We don't have much time left.

1590
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:19,610
Let's at least check this place out.

1591
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:24,950
I like how we create a memory link, but it's all fake.

1592
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:31,200
Please wait here.

1593
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,500
Someone will come and show you around shortly.

1594
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,200
Me and my NASA desk.

1595
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:38,700
To the moon.

1596
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:42,760
A story about a lame duck's attempt to become an astronaut.

1597
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:44,700
A novel by Joey Wiles.

1598
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,460
I can't believe this crap actually is.

1599
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,340
actually sold.

1600
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,620
This isn't the real world, Neil.

1601
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:55,540
How pathetic all this trouble just for some girl.

1602
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,520
That's what I thought you'd say, Neil.

1603
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:01,800
How pathetic all this trouble just for some girl.

1604
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,480
There you go.

1605
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:04,680
Good to have you back.

1606
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

1607
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,080
Wow, Nasha, this is what it looks like for real.

1608
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,240
Four bars, okay.

1609
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:37,120
Is it me or is this elevator smaller on the inside?

1610
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,580
Oh, oh, uh, two?

1611
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,720
Wait, where are we at now?

1612
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,560
We were at one, right?

1613
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,600
Soul official NASA business.

1614
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:51,460
This is the Mission Control Center.

1615
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:52,920
Wow.

1616
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,900
Not much going on now, but you'll see it live one day.

1617
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,020
Wow.

1618
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,540
Like, so he just...

1619
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,860
He just, like, mailed Nassau.

1620
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:09,840
He just kept mailing Nassau and was like, let me in?

1621
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:12,000
Is this a job?

1622
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,220
Is this an internship?

1623
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:20,080
I half expected to see Zordon on that screen.

1624
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,020
It's not here.

1625
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,640
Uh, what?

1626
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,020
Let's just go.

1627
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,420
Did he, like, program...

1628
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,000
to meet...

1629
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,680
River at NASA or something.

1630
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,200
Is that what we're doing?

1631
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:41,080
They're co-workers?

1632
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:50,710
So what do you...

1633
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:53,530
So do you think last century's moon landing was...

1634
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:54,270
Let's not, Neil.

1635
01:52:54,490 --> 01:52:54,970
Let's not.

1636
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:10,390
Your records are excellent, but we'll have to monitor your status closely in the coming sessions.

1637
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:23,600
Sorry.

1638
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,180
And here's the centrifuge.

1639
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,740
If you're lucky, you'll learn to hate it one day.

1640
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,180
Ah, yes, the spinny thingy.

1641
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,080
It's not here either.

1642
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,400
What are you talking about?

1643
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:36,320
Come on, we don't have long left.

1644
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:37,580
Okay.

1645
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:38,900
I'm looking around.

1646
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:39,840
I want to ride it.

1647
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:43,580
I yawn, sorry.

1648
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:45,780
So sorry.

1649
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:47,320
Moon.

1650
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,580
Moon, moon.

1651
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:52,560
Oh, gosh.

1652
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:54,700
Gosh, we'll try to click the thing.

1653
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,140
I hope the real NASA has bigger elevators.

1654
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:13,210
The shuttle's still under heavy maintenance.

1655
01:54:13,450 --> 01:54:15,290
We may only view it from here for now.

1656
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:17,470
Oh, this isn't good.

1657
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:19,910
Perhaps there's something, somewhere we missed.

1658
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:23,990
You need to work on your communication skills.

1659
01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:26,710
Oh, hello, hello.

1660
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:30,570
Nyaru, thank you so much for the radar act.

1661
01:54:31,410 --> 01:55:28,830
so much for that gift thank you so much thank you thank you we're kind of like at the end of this game so it might be some spoilers for to the moon if you have not played thank you ashen thank you combo thank you cc thank you thank you thank you thank you boulder bird thank you now well thank you fireball thank you thank you guys for all the gift thank you thank you thank you thank you pretty sad so Rust and glitch race thank you Whimsy thank you thank you guys thank you so much oh requires red memory length to put oh do I go look whoa wow I said it first you you you you thank you wrong for rabbit there wait no you're just wrong rabbit what happened to the four thank you

1662
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:36,510
Thank you guys so much.

1663
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:37,890
You are Neil.

1664
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:40,750
I have more Neilisms than I realize.

1665
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:43,730
It's not in the ad.

1666
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,250
No!

1667
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:47,250
You're always wrong for Rabbit to me.

1668
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:51,170
YouTube ate it.

1669
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:54,050
You know what's the best part of it?

1670
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:55,150
What?

1671
01:55:55,630 --> 01:55:57,330
The very top and bottom of the shuttle.

1672
01:55:59,170 --> 01:55:59,970
I'd have to agree.

1673
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:34,130
Oh, how I pity anyone who can't see those particular parts indeed especially its nose at the top when maintenance finishes it probably won't look the same yeah now's the only time rude they made us look at that so we could leave through the door they were like hey you have to see this really funny bit we put in it was the first floor right okay so you evil.

1674
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:36,770
Taxido can't thank you.

1675
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:41,330
Good bit.

1676
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:46,870
I wonder if the real NASA looks like this.

1677
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:48,190
Probably not.

1678
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:51,630
It's constructed in part with Johnny's beliefs after all.

1679
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:56,750
Ah yes, a wiki of existing facts tainted by personal fairy tales.

1680
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:06,750
It's odd though to hear birds and see none.

1681
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,560
Sorry, Neil.

1682
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,340
I really thought there was a good chance.

1683
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:20,140
What?

1684
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:27,280
And this is the break room.

1685
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,620
Maybe don't reach out for the next two minutes.

1686
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:33,200
I received a gift.

1687
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:37,560
Sorry, I don't control them, but maybe one day you will be one of the lucky chosen.

1688
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:39,420
I think it's all random.

1689
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:42,600
Here's David.

1690
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,560
He's a mission specialist.

1691
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,360
Nice to meet you.

1692
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:52,500
At least he got into NASA, I guess.

1693
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:54,720
You think he made it to the end?

1694
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:59,180
Even if he did, it'd take more than just a few years to become an astronaut.

1695
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,820
Let's hurry and find the last link then.

1696
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:03,980
I'd hate to miss the finale.

1697
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:05,720
Oh.

1698
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,300
What's going on?

1699
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:10,480
Are we out of time?

1700
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:12,700
I don't know.

1701
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:23,980
And here's our other new recruit!

1702
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:28,160
River, right?

1703
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,200
Good to have you on board.

1704
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,020
Hello, I'm John.

1705
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:46,560
I almost thought she was...

1706
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,160
What the?

1707
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:47,840
Viva!

1708
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,740
But you deleted her!

1709
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:52,940
No, I told you, I just moved her.

1710
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:56,740
I knew it, I knew it!

1711
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,700
I knew she'd be here.

1712
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:02,700
What she does with her life here is still up to her.

1713
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,140
But this new world is based on public data and Johnny's own beliefs.

1714
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:14,480
And since River's data as an individual is not recorded in the public domain, it all comes from Johnny.

1715
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,020
But even then, that merely increases the odds.

1716
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,700
How are you sure that it'd work?

1717
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:24,920
I wasn't.

1718
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:30,170
It could have gone very badly, you know.

1719
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:31,370
It sucks that.

1720
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:34,110
They lost all those memories together, but...

1721
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,770
I guess, you know.

1722
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:40,210
It's still nice that they meet it all.

1723
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:44,250
You were never one to take risks, Neil.

1724
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:48,170
Let's just say I won this round.

1725
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:52,090
We still have two spare helmets.

1726
01:59:52,110 --> 02:00:02,110
right I think John need to appreciate some company they

1727
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:14,690
do sell the rest of their lives after this so true the heartbeat

1728
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:50,940
he wrote it himself apparently rather repetitive if you ask me though everyone's a critic what's it called To the boon!

1729
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,780
I like that name.

1730
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,000
What it used to be for you!

1731
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,920
It's meant for you!

1732
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:15,970
Her side eye.

1733
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:23,700
Whoa.

1734
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,280
Everybody's getting in on the helmets.

1735
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:28,740
Okay.

1736
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:30,340
Crazy.

1737
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,260
Who's watching the kids?

1738
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:41,740
Oh.

1739
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:53,570
Oh, there you are.

1740
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,450
You two should go get some rest.

1741
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:56,870
Tomorrow's the big day.

1742
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:05,750
Oh, look at them.

1743
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:09,190
If I were going into space, I think I'd shave my head.

1744
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:13,550
I wouldn't want to deal with my hair.

1745
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,720
Hudson River.

1746
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:23,500
Oh my god!

1747
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:29,350
Oh.

1748
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,220
Bald Minto confirmed.

1749
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:38,880
I want to be an astronaut too, Dad!

1750
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:42,400
One day, son, you just might.

1751
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,760
Shut up fake child.

1752
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:48,460
Oh!

1753
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:50,440
Oh!

1754
02:02:52,660 --> 02:03:24,360
did you think that they would make it ha did you no the way she is I didn't think she would succeed but I I guess I was wrong all the better then isn't it yes I'm happy for them you should have seen him back when we were went to school together I swear the guy never arrested him he just kept on trying and trying It was like he only had one goal to work for.

1755
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:29,440
You know, that's my brother in that shuttle.

1756
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:30,780
Wow!

1757
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:34,140
Yep, I once wrote a book about this, too.

1758
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:37,980
Oh, good luck with your move.

1759
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:41,460
With a less optimistic ending.

1760
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:43,700
Might have to change that after all.

1761
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,660
Hey, Dr. Watts, right?

1762
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:51,120
Thank you for letting us in here.

1763
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:54,420
Yeah, Eva's the one who requested it.

1764
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:57,360
Was she?

1765
02:03:57,720 --> 02:04:00,120
I don't actually remember who brought up the two extra helmets.

1766
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:07,870
Did you find out why he wanted to go to the moon?

1767
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:09,430
Sure.

1768
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:12,310
And what all happened here?

1769
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:18,610
Let's just say it was a bunch of sappy cheese that sorted itself out.

1770
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:29,600
You know, there were quite a few times last night when I thought we lost it.

1771
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:30,100
Johnny.

1772
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:33,560
I think he consciously held on to wait for you too.

1773
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,860
He's rather patient then.

1774
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,820
I just hope it's worth the wait.

1775
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,560
Go on now, your colleagues waiting.

1776
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:47,980
Whoa!

1777
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:50,160
I thought this might be a good view.

1778
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,120
Good enough to cut off the traffic, eh?

1779
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:56,060
Sure, even if they were real.

1780
02:05:00,790 --> 02:05:01,710
Well, this is it.

1781
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:07,410
All we've worked for ready to initiate

1782
02:05:10,730 --> 02:05:24,750
initiate come up here why why not you're just gonna push me off the ledge again aren't you probably but the view is worth the odds

1783
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:28,820
come on

1784
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:39,280
oh my gosh mission control whoa we're seeing It happened!

1785
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:40,740
We're seeing it live!

1786
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:45,140
Oh my gosh, the team!

1787
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:48,720
Oh my gosh, they're in the shuttle!

1788
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:56,360
Oh!

1789
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,500
I have to

1790
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:10,540
make it first!

1791
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,930
Because one day I'm going to befriend one of them.

1792
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:29,230
Oh!

1793
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,380
Watch out birds!

1794
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:03,440
Get out of the way!

1795
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:34,420
Yeah, I didn't really ship them, so...

1796
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:17,330
So the memories come back?

1797
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:21,590
Oh, the simulation is breaking.

1798
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:24,450
Oh

1799
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:40,940
Her side eye the last side eye

1800
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:51,540
It's so bittersweet

1801
02:09:56,020 --> 02:10:01,780
I would be so pissed if someone reprogrammed my memories to just have me be studying my whole life.

1802
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,940
I would be so mad.

1803
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,280
How dare you do that to me?

1804
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:11,800
How dare you make me do science don't work?

1805
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,320
Emily was in the credits?

1806
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:36,760
I didn't see it.

1807
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:42,400
Yeah, but you'd be so smart.

1808
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:44,380
And then I wouldn't be a V-tuber.

1809
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:05,060
Here he is.

1810
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,140
Thanks.

1811
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:09,080
Off you go now.

1812
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,040
I don't want to read.

1813
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:18,440
I still can't believe Johnny just wheeled the house to Lily like that.

1814
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:19,100
Why?

1815
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:20,840
What do you mean you can't believe that?

1816
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:24,720
Who else was there to give it to?

1817
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:25,340
Us?

1818
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:30,140
Terrible place for burials, though.

1819
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,980
If there's a landslide, they'd be swimming with the fishes.

1820
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,540
Still a little too soon.

1821
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:39,640
Nah, it's never soon enough.

1822
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:43,540
Nice new ringtone.

1823
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:47,880
Wait, we never heard about his painkiller or stuff.

1824
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,720
Hello, Eva here.

1825
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,400
We're on our way.

1826
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,080
New patient, new patient.

1827
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:58,300
Let's roll.

1828
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:12,840
The ending still gets beach time.

1829
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,300
That's so good.

1830
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:17,400
What was that?

1831
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:21,300
Spooky.

1832
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:23,760
So there, that would be the...

1833
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,820
So it's a prequel and then a sequel.

1834
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:29,160
That exists.

1835
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,160
I don't know though.

1836
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:37,140
I feel like I got so invested in Johnny and River that...

1837
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,180
I don't know.

1838
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:44,180
Oh.

1839
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:16,700
It was so sweet.

1840
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:21,840
I can't believe everything was just her trying to get him to remember.

1841
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,580
Makes me so sad.

1842
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,220
Oh, took me out from the music.

1843
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,480
Thank you for being a part of this adventure.

1844
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:45,760
The story continues.

1845
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:47,760
Finding Paradise.

1846
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:49,800
Imposter Factory.

1847
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:51,240
Whoa.

1848
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:03,260
Sussy.

1849
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:07,420
When the game is sus.

1850
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:09,240
When the factory is sus.

1851
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:13,020
The other games in this franchise are good but not as hard hitting to me.

1852
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,460
Though the music in all of them is peak.

1853
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:16,520
Bird!

1854
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:19,380
Wish my life away also made me cry.

1855
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,200
I don't know that one.

1856
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,340
Congrats, I'm finishing this beautiful game.

1857
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:23,220
Thank you!

1858
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:33,200
What makes me so sad about it too though is...

1859
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:35,360
The lighthouse is still lonely.

1860
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,480
In the new memory.

1861
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,600
New game plus.

1862
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:48,000
What was the vocal song called in this game?

1863
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:54,090
Lily will be there.

1864
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:57,590
No, I meant in the... I guess in the fabricated memory.

1865
02:14:58,730 --> 02:15:00,270
That's not real.

1866
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:02,810
I don't know.

1867
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:05,110
Oh, everything's alright.

1868
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:20,660
Oh, that I gotta blow my nose.

1869
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:37,080
Don't mute.

1870
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:38,140
Sorry, too late.

1871
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:42,400
Should we add everything's alright too?

1872
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:43,640
Karaoke.

1873
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:49,520
Maybe I'll, maybe next time.

1874
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:53,220
Virtual Joey can live in the Virtual Lighthouse.

1875
02:15:56,020 --> 02:16:00,180
I guess, I guess honestly, what...

1876
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:02,680
What...

1877
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:04,560
Um...

1878
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,360
Sorry.

1879
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:16,980
What Eva constructed was maybe like the quote-unquote best possible events that could have been in his life or something, you know.

1880
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:18,480
Maybe.

1881
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:28,370
It came with a risk.

1882
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:29,770
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1883
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:36,790
I mean, it did kind of like erase his purpose for going to the moon.

1884
02:16:37,410 --> 02:16:39,430
But if he remembered in the end.

1885
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:45,330
If he remembered right before it ended anyway.

1886
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:50,450
So, um, I don't want to be that person, but he didn't actually go to the moon.

1887
02:16:59,550 --> 02:17:00,830
They didn't make it.

1888
02:17:10,730 --> 02:17:35,310
Laura Shikihara who did the music and sang in the games is the same as my plans versus zombies oh my gosh like the zombie on your lawn song thanks for the streaming tell revisiting the story always gets me i'm so glad i played it it's so pretty hope you enjoyed my favorite canadian indie game it was so nice yeah wow

1889
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:42,320
well i guess the game is called to the moon.

1890
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:45,580
It's not called on the moon, so...

1891
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,200
Technically he did.

1892
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:53,520
All the memories afterwards played up till... Oh, that's true.

1893
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:55,140
They only watched the launching.

1894
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:55,900
That's true.

1895
02:17:58,480 --> 02:17:59,380
That is true.

1896
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,320
There's something Neil would... That's something Neil would say.

1897
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:09,520
Oh, I'm so glad I played it.

1898
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:44,200
cry though i was trying to be strong what made me cry oh the whole like revelation about it made me so about her just trying to get him to remember everything it's too the kid clips in about the memories is sad i know it's so sad dargo thank you so much for that guys feeling conflicted so a Joey apparently smell like day-old roadkill right now.

1899
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,720
No, there was a squirrel, though.

1900
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,280
There was a squirrel at the bottom.

1901
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:54,960
I think he was... I think he connected that memory.

1902
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:59,740
Two, is the final paper rabbit weird for wearing clothes, or are the rest weird for being naked?

1903
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,900
That's a light-hearted question.

1904
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:13,850
The bomb probably hit that squirrel, too.

1905
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:15,850
I think she needs glasses.

1906
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:21,870
As a reminder, River and John still met when they were young children.

1907
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:24,910
That's why River had to go poo for the rest of it.

1908
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:26,870
He was looking for her.

1909
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,580
They did meet on the moon.

1910
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:49,410
You can think of a morbid answer for that.

1911
02:19:50,190 --> 02:19:54,150
Is it because when you die, you poop your pants?

1912
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:57,350
It didn't happen to me, though.

1913
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:00,270
different.

1914
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:21,540
I can't have you guys thinking about me like that.

1915
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,560
Thanks for letting us know boss, of course.

1916
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:40,060
Just trying to lighten the mood up a little bit while I have tears streaming down my face.

1917
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:44,100
All that for just some girl.

1918
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:55,510
I'm different is wild.

1919
02:20:57,090 --> 02:20:59,870
She fasted for 48 hours.

1920
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:05,060
Oh gosh.

1921
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:08,940
Her butt stays sledge.

1922
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,800
What a sweet kid.

1923
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,040
Oh.

1924
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:20,560
I was getting nachos.

1925
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,040
Say the funny thing again.

1926
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:29,200
The need for brown super jets.

1927
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:30,220
Don't say that.

1928
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:45,740
Honestly, though, if I were in this situation, I don't know which I would want.

1929
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:56,140
Like, I guess technically they fulfilled his dream and also gave his brother a life.

1930
02:21:57,140 --> 02:21:59,000
And he still met River in the end.

1931
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:02,260
But...

1932
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:05,000
All the original memories, too.

1933
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:06,720
They're all so precious, you know.

1934
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:11,100
I always wondered why there was chocolate on her leg.

1935
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:11,900
Don't say that.

1936
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,140
Don't wonder that either.

1937
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:16,140
Tissue buns for me, though.

1938
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,280
I've wasted...

1939
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,020
Thank you.

1940
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:20,680
Oh.

1941
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:24,500
All the memories of him eating olives.

1942
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:25,660
Oh, gosh.

1943
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:26,960
You know what?

1944
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:28,280
Maybe the new ones were better.

1945
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,820
He wasted years without the woman he loved, so I think the new timeline is an L.

1946
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:37,780
I agree.

1947
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:39,720
I agree.

1948
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:43,300
Your IBS kept you from pooping.

1949
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:45,600
No, I don't think that's what IBS does.

1950
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,620
It's the opposite, no?

1951
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:49,020
Such an amoe game.

1952
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,000
Thank you for the stream.

1953
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,040
Thank you!

1954
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,680
The real despair is that River died never knowing why John forgot about their first meeting.

1955
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:02,340
I didn't think about that.

1956
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:11,280
Unless...

1957
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,760
She might have known that he had a brother.

1958
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,220
She might have known that he had a brother and then the brother disappeared.

1959
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:24,740
She, but maybe, I don't know.

1960
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:26,400
I guess not, right?

1961
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:31,720
And her just trying to get him to remember just really breaks my heart.

1962
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:37,120
Because, you know, she gives him the little paper bunny.

1963
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:40,080
And she's, like, asking him what he sees.

1964
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:49,380
And if even when I was playing that part, I was feeling like a little frustrated like I don't know he's describing the bunny.

1965
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:50,500
What do you expect?

1966
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,040
Just thinking it was her being kind of quirky

1967
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:12,250
But then also What triggered that was the dead bunny that like the the bunny road kill so I wonder if she put two and two together or something

1968
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:20,220
I wonder Hmm

1969
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:37,960
It was him saying he dated her for clout.

1970
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:39,600
Oh, that's right.

1971
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:41,840
Wait, or was that what triggered it?

1972
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,360
Oh, I guess you're right, yeah.

1973
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:48,880
But then she knows that that's not...

1974
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:52,600
She like knows in her heart that's not the real reason.

1975
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,680
Yeah, it all comes back to the roadkill.

1976
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:57,800
No!

1977
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,100
I've been taking walks.

1978
02:25:02,100 --> 02:26:00,560
Like, recently on my way, walks I've been finding like dead baby snakes is it I'm like why are there so many snakes first of all it's so strange all these little snakes just saw one today oh my gosh I think it must have been so heartbreaking to watch him throw the hacky sack like it was nothing yeah everything meant something to her everything meant something to her and to him he couldn't remember why she had the platypus why why about the bunnies why about the hacky sack how much that meaning meant to her how she probably felt so seen like talking to him about everything and how it resonated with her so much i

1979
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:28,130
just i saw an interpretation of that very last scene of johnny and river as i'm meeting in heaven him giving her the platypus is a way of saying he remembered her this game always made me cry so happy you played it it made me cry too she cut her hair afterwards so that she had the same hairstyle as when they first i didn't think about that oh my gosh no no

1980
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:32,910
I choose that ending.

1981
02:26:47,870 --> 02:26:50,150
I keep almost tripping over deer.

1982
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:52,210
Oh, they're alive and kicking, though.

1983
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:53,270
Oh my gosh.

1984
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:58,470
The more one thinks the sadder the game gets.

1985
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:06,160
Terrible day for brain.

1986
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,280
She tried so hard.

1987
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:10,980
She did.

1988
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:25,860
My favorite part is that Johnny's belief in her memories place her at nasa too oh that's true

1989
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:43,510
we ever probably realized johnny didn't remember their first meeting he didn't know what the hacky sack or platypus meant so much to her that must have hurt she couldn't express it either yeah

1990
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:51,420
so sad the beta blockers

1991
02:27:55,690 --> 02:28:23,750
I wonder if That was His choice As a child You don't really have Like If If his mom sort of forced him to do that It was definitely the moms I think I think so I

1992
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:33,680
think robbing his desire of the meaning behind it makes it a bit hollow.

1993
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:35,240
Technically, that fulfilled the contract.

1994
02:28:35,460 --> 02:28:38,260
But if he didn't remember Rabbit Tummy, was it really worth it?

1995
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:41,420
Good late Tum Tum Day.

1996
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,340
Yeah.

1997
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:46,360
That's how I feel about it.

1998
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:49,300
I think that's why it's also very bittersweet of an ending.

1999
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:51,680
Because it does kind of...

2000
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,260
The meaning of going to the moon...

2001
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,120
Was a little lost.

2002
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:04,200
Mom was the villain Honestly

2003
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:23,240
Acceptance as much as resolution

2004
02:29:34,740 --> 02:29:44,340
Like the moral ambiguity of the concept of destroying a dying person's memories and replacing them with better ones Moments before they're destroyed anyway It's a very interesting concept

2005
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:53,710
Like What to be at peace What?

2006
02:29:55,150 --> 02:29:56,790
Where were you guys when I died?

2007
02:29:58,090 --> 02:29:59,890
Not you guys, but like the company.

2008
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:09,590
Both garter snakes and diamond backs have eggs that hatch internally, which mean they have a sort of live birth instead of laying eggs.

2009
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:11,770
Wait, Kinky!

2010
02:30:12,430 --> 02:30:14,770
How are, like, your bees and stuff?

2011
02:30:31,770 --> 02:30:32,330
Bees!

2012
02:30:36,350 --> 02:30:36,910
Please!

2013
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:43,880
Please.

2014
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:47,940
Maybe you being a bee tuber is them doing their job.

2015
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,860
We're in a simulation.

2016
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:56,800
You guys kinky is a beekeeper.

2017
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:02,760
And it's been a while since I've heard about it.

2018
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:09,460
So I was just asking.

2019
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:12,760
Trying to be nice.

2020
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:14,600
And I'm curious.

2021
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,760
Unfortunately, I lost both of my hives!

2022
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:20,940
This year after a family crisis when next year will be better.

2023
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,760
I'm sure thanks for asking though.

2024
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:23,200
No!

2025
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:31,580
No, it's a peace.

2026
02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:38,130
I hope everything's okay.

2027
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:06,280
All bad news all around.

2028
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,520
Knockers, stop crying, the floodgates.

2029
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:19,820
Quick!

2030
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:41,360
out uh oh my gosh i'll like i'll like watch a i'll watch tick tock later and it'll be like here's a grandpa and he's playing the violin for his for his dead wife one last time and i'll

2031
02:32:51,710 --> 02:32:55,530
And then if floodgates just, they're already open, I'll just...

2032
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:12,140
Please play the other games, they're worth it.

2033
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:13,880
Are they about the same length as this one?

2034
02:33:17,330 --> 02:33:20,560
I'm definitely interested in checking them out, so...

2035
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:24,830
Yeah, about the same?

2036
02:33:26,390 --> 02:33:27,270
Similar but longer.

2037
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:27,590
Okay,

2038
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:31,510
okay.

2039
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:33,290
Okay, okay.

2040
02:33:40,490 --> 02:33:41,810
More RPG Maker.

2041
02:33:41,970 --> 02:33:44,050
I love RPG Maker games.

2042
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:46,090
Oh, actually I love RPG Maker games.

2043
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:49,170
Like horror RPG Maker games.

2044
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:52,870
Those are kind of my jam.

2045
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:59,950
Oh, I should maybe play some of those to get out, to knock games out for me trying to be 50 games this year.

2046
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:06,190
On the bright side, my beef stew came out pretty good.

2047
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:07,850
Let's go!

2048
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:11,150
Yeah, we take those!

2049
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:15,090
Check out the mini-sodes.

2050
02:34:19,810 --> 02:34:21,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2051
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:28,070
I've played I played Witch's House more recently than not.

2052
02:34:29,410 --> 02:35:01,290
I feel like I could play eeb but I remember so I played eeb a ton so I remember so much of it still what else is there's like hanged man those are all the classics last from the past one point yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about which is house for back then so that was one of my first games I played on my channel actually which is house oh crooked man that's what I was thinking yeah thank you I said hanged man Sorry,

2053
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:02,910
thinking of the game.

2054
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:04,070
Mad Father!

2055
02:35:04,850 --> 02:35:07,090
I feel like I played that one not so long ago, too.

2056
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:09,890
Do you ever play Chrono Trigger?

2057
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:13,430
Wondering if this game got you triggered at parts like the rest of us.

2058
02:35:13,630 --> 02:35:14,450
I haven't!

2059
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:15,950
I want to, though.

2060
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:20,010
Mogeko Casual.

2061
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:20,970
I don't know that one.

2062
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:25,050
RPG Maker Horror Games can be completed quickly.

2063
02:35:25,850 --> 02:35:27,450
Could play the Black Souls series.

2064
02:35:27,570 --> 02:35:28,850
Streamer Safe editions, of course.

2065
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,970
What's the not streamer?

2066
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:38,550
I feel like Chrono Trigger is one of those games that like...

2067
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:51,180
It's like one of those RPG games that like...

2068
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:54,480
It's like quintessential.

2069
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:55,700
You know?

2070
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:57,000
It's a classic.

2071
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,080
I broke my Tetra record again this dream!

2072
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:01,200
Let's go!

2073
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:03,560
I think I play better when I'm in pain.

2074
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,840
Let's go!

2075
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:11,080
It's like 30 hours.

2076
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:12,360
Oh my gosh.

2077
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:16,460
Our JRPGs tend to be that way.

2078
02:36:17,140 --> 02:36:18,800
That's why it's really tough sometimes.

2079
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,680
I would like to try it, though.

2080
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:26,700
I would.

2081
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:28,820
But guys.

2082
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:31,100
I gotta go pack.

2083
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:34,140
I gotta go finish packing.

2084
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,980
Oh, too mean.

2085
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:40,600
Don't go to Trigger being longer, 20 hours apart.

2086
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:43,860
It's what made me learn English.

2087
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:46,220
So I would love it if it ever happened.

2088
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:47,940
Oh my gosh, Karateka!

2089
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:49,320
Wait, that's so awesome!

2090
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:53,340
That's so cool.

2091
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:58,660
Yeah, safe travels.

2092
02:36:58,920 --> 02:36:59,600
Thank you.

2093
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,700
I am a little nervous.

2094
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:01,660
I'm not gonna lie.

2095
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:03,600
Can I get a happy birthday?

2096
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:04,420
Sago!

2097
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:05,200
Oh!

2098
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:06,340
Happy birthday!

2099
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:09,340
BHD Killers!

2100
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:10,480
My birthday was yesterday.

2101
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:11,920
Can I get a Vito week?

2102
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:14,720
Happy birthday!

2103
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:17,400
Have a good trip, Minky.

2104
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:18,420
Don't overwork yourself.

2105
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:19,560
Thank you.

2106
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:21,880
Thank you.

2107
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:24,000
I'll be back Tuesday.

2108
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:25,560
Tuesday to stream.

2109
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:28,160
No, no, sorry.

2110
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:28,540
Sorry.

2111
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:30,440
I said I would stream Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

2112
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,320
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

2113
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,200
I will stream.

2114
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:37,080
Or at least one of those days.

2115
02:37:37,180 --> 02:37:38,320
If not all three.

2116
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:40,420
At least one.

2117
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:41,440
Maybe all three.

2118
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:45,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2119
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:46,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2120
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:46,780
Safe travels.

2121
02:37:47,440 --> 02:37:48,200
Take your time, boss.

2122
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:49,120
Don't leave anything important.

2123
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:49,780
Thank you.

2124
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:51,140
Bon voyage, boss.

2125
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,740
Bon voyage.

2126
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:54,400
Bon voyage.

2127
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:58,940
I will see you next when I see you next.

2128
02:37:59,540 --> 02:37:59,860
Yeah.

2129
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:06,240
And I guess maybe since I'll be on my laptop, we could play something kind of easy.

2130
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:07,060
Maybe it will be.

2131
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:09,460
end up being an RPG horror game or something.

2132
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:11,900
Otsubito!

2133
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:13,240
Thank you, everybody!

2134
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:14,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2135
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:15,660
Iterasha!

2136
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:18,220
Thank you so much for suggesting to the moon.

2137
02:38:19,380 --> 02:38:20,120
Everybody who did.

2138
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:22,020
I really, really enjoyed it.

2139
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:23,720
I'm glad we could...

2140
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:25,220
I'm glad we could play it together.

2141
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:29,500
Also, I've never heard you say moe, moe, boo!

2142
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:30,920
I say it all the time.

2143
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:31,740
What are you talking about?

2144
02:38:34,380 --> 02:38:35,140
Bye-bye!

2145
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:45,420
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, see you, see you in a couple days, see you in a couple days, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, see you in a couple days, bye, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see,

2146
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:45,420
see, see, see, see, see,
