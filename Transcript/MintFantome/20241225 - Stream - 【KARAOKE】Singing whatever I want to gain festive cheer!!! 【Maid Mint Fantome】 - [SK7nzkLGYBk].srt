1
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,140
Okay, good.

2
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,340
Oh my gosh, BobbyDev, wow.

3
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,720
Thank you for asking such a wonderful question.

4
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360
What is that BGM that is in my intro music?

5
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,540
Oh my gosh, that is such a great question.

6
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:46,760
It's my original BGM composed by Mitsukiyo that a version, a one hour version, will be uploaded to my channel this Friday.

7
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:56,260
So if you ever want to just listen over and over and over again, you can listen.

8
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,240
And this Friday, it will be uploaded.

9
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah, Mitsukiyo-san.

10
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,520
Yeah.

11
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,340
Anyway, welcome.

12
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,160
Merry Christmas.

13
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,780
Yeah.

14
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Whoa, there's so many gifted.

15
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,560
Whoa, there's so many gifted.

16
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Whoa, there's so many notifications.

17
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,640
Oh, you guys, my voice is like so dead.

18
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,420
I don't know why.

19
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,640
Great day for a karaoke, probably.

20
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Kara-kitty-kove, thanks for the five gifted.

21
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,640
I'm scrolling!

22
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm scrolling!

23
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm scrolling!

24
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm scrolling!

25
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,060
I'm scrolling!

26
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm scrolling!

27
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm scrolling!

28
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm scrolling!

29
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm scrolling!

30
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,440
Thank you for the superchats.

31
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,560
Thank you.

32
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh, invisible Moose, thanks for the 20.

33
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
Lakery, thanks for the 20.

34
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,120
Cece, thanks for the 10!

35
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,780
It wasn't my birthday today, could I get a happy birthday by any chance?

36
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,920
Oh my gosh, hold on.

37
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm gonna grab a cough drop.

38
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,910
I'm also gonna put on some BGM.

39
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,290
Since I'm just talking right now.

40
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,950
Hold on.

41
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,320
I just remembered something.

42
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh, BGM.

43
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm gonna put on something.

44
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,240
Guys, I'm not prepared at all.

45
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,820
I'm so sorry.

46
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm so little prepared.

47
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,900
So little prepared.

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,200
Little prepared.

49
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:29,600
I hope you guys are having a good Christmas Eve or Christmas or whatever whatever that you're doing.

50
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,060
Holiday time.

51
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,680
Day off work.

52
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,840
Days off work.

53
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,580
Hopefully for you, you can just relax and chill and everything.

54
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,960
Hopefully.

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,940
Do you guys...I forgot to ask.

56
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,520
Do you guys like my...my...my...my Santa?

57
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,460
Do you guys like it?

58
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm so red today.

59
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm like a cranberry.

60
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,940
I'm like a full apple.

61
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,640
It's cute?

62
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,320
Yeah?

63
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,540
Yeah?

64
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,720
OK.

65
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,980
I didn't find any BGM, but I'll still sing you Happy Birthday.

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,440
Happy birthday to you.

67
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,280
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,660
Happy birthday dear Mia.

69
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,740
Happy birthday to you.

70
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,240
Happy birthday!

71
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,340
Can I get a happy birthday to Kasumi?

72
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,220
I'm trying to surprise her.

73
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,810
One more time!

74
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,540
Happy birthday to you.

75
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,740
Happy birthday to you.

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,320
Happy birthday dear Kasumi.

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,680
Happy birthday to you.

78
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,600
Happy birthday!

79
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,700
Candy canes.

80
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,520
No.

81
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,040
No.

82
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,140
Well, maybe.

83
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,560
Maybe kind of.

84
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,740
Oh my god.

85
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,580
Candy canes are mint flavored.

86
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm like a little spiral treat.

87
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,140
Music.

88
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh, this one.

89
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't know what this sounds like.

90
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,900
What is this?

91
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,140
It's called Christmas.

92
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,950
This works.

93
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,690
Peppermint.

94
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,330
Peppermint.

95
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,590
Why is this so...

96
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:50,820
I don't remember when I ever downloaded this.

97
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,620
In 2020.

98
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,300
Four years ago I've been holding on to this music.

99
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,580
I don't think I ever used it.

100
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,820
Mint karaoke on my birthday.

101
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,980
Too much trouble to request a MGSV style birthday song.

102
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,420
Where are you?

103
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,460
Happy birthday.

104
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,500
Congratulations.

105
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,440
Happy birthday with salutations.

106
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,340
Happy birthday.

107
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,380
May your sky stay blue.

108
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,860
Happy birthday to you.

109
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh my god.

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,780
A little Christmas music.

111
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,320
Wow, guys.

112
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,500
Welcome to karaoke.

113
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
I feel like...

114
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,980
I feel like I've seen a million and one people streaming karaoke today.

115
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,820
Me included.

116
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,600
That's okay.

117
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,180
It's like a concert everywhere you go, right?

118
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,340
It's great.

119
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,960
Now it's a million and two.

120
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,080
Two?

121
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,420
Best karaoke day.

122
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,940
I just... I was like... I don't quite...

123
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,960
I don't quite know what to do, so...

124
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,180
I was like, maybe a karaoke...

125
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,080
I feel like I've been doing quite a lot of karaoke recently, so...

126
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,620
After this one, taking a break.

127
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,240
After this, taking a break of karaoke.

128
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,720
For a bit.

129
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
I do need to rest my voice.

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
Also the concert recently.

131
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Yeah, exactly.

132
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,720
Too much singing.

133
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,560
Too much singing.

134
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,560
You guys will be like, oh, it's nothing special.

135
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,540
If I don't put more breaks in.

136
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,520
But you know why also, I pay for the caravan monthly.

137
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,840
So I was like, I gotta do a karaoke at least once a month so that I can...

138
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,220
So that I can not just be not paying for it, you know what I mean?

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,540
A while ago, say about one year ago...

140
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,540
When I did the caravan, it would be like...

141
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,900
It was like $50 a month.

142
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,140
In heaven, to use it, because I was in heaven.

143
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,300
But since I'm not in heaven anymore, it's not as expensive.

144
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,960
So I would be like, oh my god, I need to really do karaoke.

145
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah, it was $50 a month to use it.

146
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,320
Mmm...

147
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,260
Merry Christmas, Mint.

148
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Thank you!

149
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,400
Yeah, there was like basically two...

150
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,340
Two, not memberships, two subscriptions you could do.

151
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,480
So...

152
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,140
But now I have it a little bit cheaper.

153
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,440
Yippee!

154
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,260
Yeah.

155
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Business subscription?

156
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,440
Oh, basically.

157
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,980
Basically, basically.

158
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
So...

159
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,400
Yeah.

160
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,770
I'm just singing whatever today.

161
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,910
I feel like you guys are probably so sick of Christmas songs.

162
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,570
And...

163
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,330
I don't have to sing any.

164
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,650
Maybe a few.

165
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,810
Just to get into the Christmas mood.

166
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,630
PS, you smell.

167
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,030
I didn't... Well, no, I did read it, but...

168
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,970
Imagine if I didn't read it and all I saw was you smell.

169
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,250
So...

170
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,850
But yeah, Merry Christmas!

171
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,090
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

172
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,870
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

173
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,630
Merry Christmas, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas.

174
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,450
You're just now getting into the spirit?

175
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,030
I feel like the Grinch this year.

176
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,970
I don't know, I haven't...

177
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,270
Even though I've been doing stuff, I've been trying to get my own self into the spirit.

178
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,610
I am a spirit.

179
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,070
I think it's because I don't go outside.

180
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,070
I went to... I went to...

181
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,350
The mall the other day.

182
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,110
And I was like, wow, Christmas.

183
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,590
Because I don't really go outside, I never feel like I'm in Christmas time.

184
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,610
I just stay home.

185
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,610
Congrats on 300k!

186
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,750
Thank you!

187
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,430
Thank you so much for a wonderful year, Minto.

188
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,210
Thank you!

189
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,350
Mall still exists?

190
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,090
Yeah!

191
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,690
I had to go to one.

192
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,510
For like a specific store I wanted to go to, sorry.

193
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,650
I'm still eating my cough drop.

194
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,930
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.

195
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,510
Thanks for the shoes!

196
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,890
Make cafes more comfortable than grass.

197
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,930
So true.

198
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,090
But that's okay.

199
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,530
I hope you guys are feeling a little bit spirited.

200
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,030
To be honest, I actually really dislike Christmas.

201
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,270
I actually don't really like it so much at all, but...

202
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,230
I think when we are able to do...

203
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,970
When we are able to do...

204
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,690
Stuff together makes it better for me.

205
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,970
I have my own reasons, but...

206
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,150
She's going full Grinch.

207
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:57,970
No!

208
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,330
But, you know.

209
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,090
I'm glad that we can at least do fun stuff and...

210
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,970
It's still fun to...

211
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,170
To do things and do festive things.

212
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,130
It's maybe a fake it till you make it kind of moment.

213
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,030
Where I'm like...

214
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,350
If I do so much festive stuff, I'll feel...

215
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,610
I'll feel the spirit.

216
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,390
Is it another birthday?

217
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,850
Wait, I missed it.

218
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,870
Can I get an early sad happy birthday song for any...

219
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,610
For my attempts at getting happy birthday songs?

220
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,370
Oh no!

221
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,710
Derpy as derp!

222
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,150
Happy birthday to you!

223
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,070
Happy birthday to you!

224
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,610
Happy birthday Derpy as derp!

225
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,530
Happy birthday to you!

226
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,530
Happy birthday!

227
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,310
So many birthdays.

228
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,030
I don't really have a set list or anything.

229
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,230
And I'll sing English and Japanese.

230
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,950
Whatever I feel like.

231
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,510
Whatever I feel like.

232
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,250
Okay, I'm sick of this emo music.

233
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,210
I'm sick of the emo music.

234
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,650
Let's sing...

235
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,190
Oh, you know what?

236
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,910
Let's get this one.

237
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,890
This song in.

238
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,690
Let's get this song in.

239
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,930
Since...

240
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,630
Since I'm the Grinch.

241
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,030
Wait, what's the...

242
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,810
Maybe this one.

243
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,900
This will be our test song.

244
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,940
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

245
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,540
You really are a heel.

246
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,060
You're as cuddly as a cactus.

247
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,320
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch.

248
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:13,320
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel.

249
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,780
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch.

250
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,360
Your heart's an empty hole.

251
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,840
Your brain is full of spiders.

252
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,780
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch.

253
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,380
I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot paw.

254
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,180
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch.

255
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,900
You have termites in your smile.

256
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,450
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch.

257
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:09,010
Given the choice between the two of you, I take the seasick crocodile.

258
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,750
Good thing I'm a garlic girl.

259
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,350
I kind of want the garlic though.

260
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,810
I think...

261
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,930
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch.

262
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,230
You're the king of sinful thoughts.

263
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,710
Your heart's a dead tomato splat with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch.

264
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,710
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce.

265
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,270
Yummy.

266
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,470
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch.

267
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,090
With a nausea super nause.

268
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:10,250
You're a crooked jerky jockey and you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch.

269
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,890
Your soul is an appalling dump.

270
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,750
Heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of rubbish imaginable.

271
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,830
Mangled up, entangled up nuts.

272
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,510
I'm talking about you.

273
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,810
It's a self-insert song.

274
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,200
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch.

275
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,830
You're a nasty, wasty skunk.

276
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,870
Your heart is full of unwashed socks.

277
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,630
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch.

278
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,010
The three words that best describe you are as follows and I quote...

279
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,290
Stink, stank, stunk.

280
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,930
Mr. Grinch.

281
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,830
Mr. Grinch.

282
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,450
Oh my god.

283
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,750
That's one thing actually I love about Christmas is...

284
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,970
When the Grinch comes at the Universal Parks.

285
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,530
Because he's so sassy.

286
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,610
I love watching videos of him.

287
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,690
He's so funny.

288
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,010
The Grunk.

289
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,570
Don't say knee surgery.

290
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,490
Don't say that.

291
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,890
That's a brain rot I don't want to ever think about.

292
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,830
He does what?

293
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,390
What do you mean he does what?

294
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,430
He goes to the parks, to the theme parks.

295
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,870
You should check out the Liquid Grinch parody.

296
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,870
I don't think I actually have ever seen that.

297
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,510
What did the Grinch do to deserve this diss track?

298
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,130
He harassed a town and then stole all their presents.

299
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,990
And was really mean for no reason.

300
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,850
He was mean because people had fun.

301
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,870
The singer of that song was the OG voice of Tony the Tiger.

302
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,550
What?

303
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,950
No way.

304
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,970
Thanks for the time gifted.

305
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,810
The Grinch is so relatable.

306
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:51,850
What?

307
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,570
Stop being Grinch.

308
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,530
Stop being Grinch.

309
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,570
Merry Christmas Minto.

310
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,330
Merry Christmas!

311
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,270
God forbid men have hobbies.

312
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,050
Wait, how long has Tony the Tiger... Wait, when was that song released?

313
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,130
Hold on.

314
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,210
I'm going to go back to the emo music so I have nothing else.

315
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,690
Grinch song.

316
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,090
Written and composed in 1966?

317
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,630
But...

318
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,690
How old is Tony the Tiger?

319
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,310
He's a doof?

320
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,270
There's awful fan art of Tony and the Grinch.

321
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,370
I'm not quite surprised about that.

322
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,810
But don't yuck someone's yum.

323
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,190
Tony appeared in 1952?

324
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,650
What?

325
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,690
That's crazy.

326
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,190
I thought... I thought...

327
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,970
What?

328
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,550
No way.

329
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,990
No way.

330
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,710
I hope this helps get Otonoke out of my head for a while.

331
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,290
Is that the Dandaran opening?

332
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,130
Recently that song has been so stuck in my head too.

333
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,890
It's so good.

334
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,870
I only know two Creepy Nuts songs, but I like that one.

335
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,690
What was the other one?

336
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,390
I don't remember.

337
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,730
I only know two, but I like that one so much.

338
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,410
It's so good.

339
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,750
It's so, so good.

340
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:12,150
I don't know that one so well, but I really like the Dandaran opening.

341
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,770
Hmm...

342
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,530
It's so good.

343
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,830
I could not sing it though.

344
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,150
I could not sing it though.

345
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,290
OP to Call of the Night is also great.

346
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,830
I don't know that one.

347
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,990
Call of the Night.

348
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,030
Yes, yes, yes.

349
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,840
It's also Creepy Nuts.

350
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,260
They are popping off.

351
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,860
They're just so dang catchy.

352
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,580
They're so dang catchy.

353
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,720
Are you planning on singing Santa Baby?

354
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Vanilla, do you want me to sing Santa Baby?

355
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,780
Granari, thanks for the five gifted.

356
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,700
Thank you.

357
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,760
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

358
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
Santa Baby.

359
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,500
Lock in.

360
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,140
Barry, what are you doing here?

361
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,740
Barry Bug.

362
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
What are you doing here?

363
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
I only know one song from Hazbin Hotel.

364
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,820
And it's a duet.

365
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,740
I don't think I could sing it.

366
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't know if I could.

367
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,740
Tell her to buzz off.

368
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
Yeah, buzz off Bug.

369
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,700
Buzz off Bug.

370
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,620
Barry sing it with her.

371
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,700
Barry, do you know?

372
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,400
I do know Hazbin Hotel songs.

373
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,380
I've never watched it either.

374
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,040
Regress, thanks for the ten gifted.

375
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,040
Any chance for Linkin Park?

376
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,540
Now you guys are just saying anything.

377
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,480
There's a chance for anything.

378
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Angry Birds Christmas song.

379
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,110
What?

380
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,910
Lips of an angel.

381
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,930
Stop it.

382
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,090
I can sing Linkin Park.

383
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,640
ViviCorn, thanks for the five gifted.

384
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,020
Sean, thanks for the ten gifted.

385
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,100
Thank you guys so much.

386
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,190
Any chance for Inception sound effects?

387
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,750
How does that even go?

388
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,910
What does that sound like?

389
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,090
What is that?

390
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,490
Was I close?

391
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,710
Hold on.

392
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,830
I don't remember how the...

393
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,190
How the...

394
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,710
How the...

395
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,970
Reverb on the sounds, but I'll do my best.

396
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:50,550
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate, say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way, no it's not alright So I'm breaking the habits I'm breaking the habits And I'm

397
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:29,750
neglecting my cure I tightly lock the door, I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more than any time No options left again I don't want to be the one the battles always choose Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate,

398
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:45,730
say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way, it'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habits I'm breaking the habits

399
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:26,380
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate, say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way, it'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habits I'm breaking

400
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,650
the habits And I...

401
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:03,710
I said that there will be Christmas songs and whatever It doesn't have to be just Christmas It doesn't have to be just Christmas.

402
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,550
Sometimes we want to sing Linkin Park on Christmas

403
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,650
I'm sorry I could not scream like...

404
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,530
I'm

405
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,070
trying not to kill my voice so so much

406
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,090
Happy Holidays Minto!

407
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,250

408
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,250
Happy Holidays!

409
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,460
Can you sing the Apple Bottom Jeans version?

410
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh my gosh, I need to ask Phoebe for that.

411
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:49,920
It was so funny hearing Apple Bottom Jeans And boots with a fur Thank you for the Aqua Soupa May I request a song if possible?

412
00:31:50,020 --> 00:32:01,500

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:23,730
Hellfire...

418
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,130
I don't know, I feel like I can't...

419
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,530
Is my computer ok?

420
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:32,710
There we go I feel like I can't sing this song so well at all though I'm like just memeing it Are you sure you like it?

421
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,210
I'm just memeing it usually Hold on

422
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:45,570
You know I'm so much purer than The common vulgar weak licentious crowd Then tell me Maria Why I see her dancing there Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul I feel her, I see her The sun caught in her raven hair Is blazing me out of all control Like fire,

423
00:33:46,290 --> 00:34:35,170
Hellfire This fire in my skin This burning desire Is turning me to sin It's not my fault I'm not to blame It is the wisps I wish to set this flame It's not my fault If in God's plan He made the devil so much stronger than a man Protect me Maria Don't let this siren cast her spell Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone Destroy all the wisps!

424
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,690
And let them taste the fires of hell!

425
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,510
Or else let's die, I don't want them to be mine.

426
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,510
Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.

427
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,790
She's nowhere in the cathedral.

428
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:51,430
Who are you?

429
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,770
How did you get into my room?

430
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:54,730

432
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,650
You idiot!

433
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,430

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,910
Choose me or your pyre.

439
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,950
Be mine or you will burn!

440
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,350
God have mercy on you.

441
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,730
God have mercy on me.

442
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:45,910

443
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,450

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,750

For Christmas.

450
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,390
Promise?

451
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,770

452
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,730

453
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,150
Oh my gosh, burn fire!

454
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,990
Quasimodo predicted this.

455
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,200
What's another Christmas song we could sing?

456
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,000
What's another Christmas song?

457
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,470
Hmm.

458
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,610
September.

459
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,250
No!

460
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:01,210
I heard of Takagaki Ayahi's cover of All I Want for Christmas.

461
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,150
Wait, no, I don't think I have!

462
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:13,590
I was, oh my gosh, at the Hololive concert in Atlanta.

463
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:19,830
I tried, it was either Nerissa or Liz.

464
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,590
I think it was Liz.

465
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,730
Did All I Want for Christmas Is You.

466
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,010
I couldn't remember at all.

467
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,810
Have you guys ever seen the silly...

468
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,590
There was like a TikTok of like a girl...

469
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,250
I have heard that one.

470
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,430
Thank you for always being awesome.

471
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,470
No, thank you!

472
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

473
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:55,090
But she's like, oh yeah, I speak English so whenever I go to karaoke in Japan during Christmas time...

474
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,470
They want me to sing All I Want for Christmas Is You so they can do these weird like not...

475
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,770
It's like, I guess it is wotagei, I don't know.

476
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,730
It's like, I only remember like a little bit.

477
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,770
It would be like...

478
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:20,170
During, when either Liz or Nerissa was singing it, I was like trying to remember it.

479
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,030
I was the only one.

480
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,350
I was the only one doing it.

481
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,270
I was like...

482
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,210
Nobody around me...

483
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,850
Nobody around me knew what I was doing.

484
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,790
I'm afraid I was so obnoxious.

485
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,030
I was true yakai during that concert maybe.

486
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,650
Razer!

487
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,790

488
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:51,470

489
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,170
Happy birthday Razer Rex.

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,390
Happy birthday to you.

491
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,890
Happy birthday!

492
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,530
It's okay, we were two.

493
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,530
Nobody around me was doing anything.

494
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,890
I was the loudest one in my area.

495
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,670
Rosie, thank you for the 10 gift.

496
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,650
Thank you.

497
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

498
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,850
What if I just look up Christmas?

499
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,810
Christmas...

500
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:21,970
What?

501
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,350
I don't know any of these.

502
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,230
What is this?

503
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,210
Baby, please come home.

504
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,450
What is that one?

505
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,810
Christmas time?

506
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,890
Oh my god, Charlie Brown.

507
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,690
Christmas time is here.

508
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,090
Do I know that one?

509
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,070
Hippopotamus song again?

510
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,570
I like that song.

511
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,990
Oh wait, someone asked for Santa Baby, right?

512
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,470
Is this the one?

513
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:32,090
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me.

514
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:41,230
Been an awful good girl, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

515
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:54,550
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue.

516
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:04,470
I'll wait up for you dear, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

517
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:19,850
Think of all the fun I've missed, think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed.

518
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:31,230
Next year I could be just as good, if you check off my Christmas list.

519
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:39,350
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot.

520
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:49,530
Been an angel all year, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

521
00:41:54,370 --> 00:42:05,530
Santa honey, one little thing I really need, the D to a platinum mine.

522
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,850
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

523
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:24,510
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with the duplex and checks.

524
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:34,010
Sign the X on the line, Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.

525
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:49,010
Come and trim my Christmas tree, with some decorations bought at Tiffany's.

526
00:42:50,270 --> 00:43:00,410
I really do believe in you, let's see if you believe in me.

527
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:09,110
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring.

528
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:18,450
I don't mean on your phone, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

529
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,970
Hurry down the chimney tonight.

530
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,770
Hurry...tonight.

531
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,190
Fine!

532
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,410
Are you happy now?

533
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,410
Are you happy?

534
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,300
Glad I got that out of the way.

535
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,570
Wishing you butaro...butaro...butaro and pies a merry Christmas.

536
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,650
Thank you!

537
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,350
They are pregnant now.

538
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,730
Meep!

539
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,510
Meep!

540
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:20,850
Thank you for the hakusupa, meep!

541
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,750
Best I got is a ring camera.

542
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:26,950
Wow, gato!

543
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,330
Thank you for the hakusupa, thank you!

544
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,430
Minto baby got me acting unwise.

545
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,570
Stop it!

546
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,310
Control yourself!

547
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:39,690
Down!

548
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,270
Sprite!

549
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,150
Down!

550
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:41,890
Down!

551
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,710
Love deterrents, could be considered Santa or Christmas.

552
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,190
I guess it could be.

553
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,490
Maybe not love deterrents, let's do another one.

554
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,350
Let's do instead the other song.

555
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:15,070
I guess it could be because in Peace Walker they talk about...they talk about...they talk about Santa.

556
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,050
I can't think of anything right now.

557
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,470
There we go.

558
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,830
OK.

559
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:27,970
OK, OK, OK.

560
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,470
Hold on.

561
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,830
Let me double check this.

562
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,290
I think this is good, but let me double check it.

563
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:36,770
OK.

564
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,490
I might have to adjust the audio while I go.

565
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,330
Once new, old and shattered now.

566
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,670
Love can kill, love will die.

567
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,430
Give me wings to fly.

568
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,850
Fleeing this world so cold.

569
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,530
I just wonder why.

570
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,450
Cold as the dark.

571
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:39,110
Now my words are frosted with every breath.

572
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,570
Still the hate burns wild.

573
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,210
Growing inside this heart.

574
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,130
When the wind changes course.

575
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,570
When the stars align.

576
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,290
I will reach out to you.

577
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,830
And leave this all behind.

578
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,890
When heavens divide.

579
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,660
I will see the choices within my hands.

580
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:47,260
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

581
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:54,500
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

582
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,720
Do you feel the storm approach?

583
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
As the end draws near.

584
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,440
When heavens divide.

585
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,680
Time will come to softly lay me down.

586
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:16,360
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

587
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,440
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

588
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:32,000
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

589
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,260
When heavens divide.

590
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,740
I'll dive into the fire.

591
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,420
Spilling the blood of my desire.

592
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:08,340
The very last time my name is scorched into the sky.

593
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,620
When heavens divide.

594
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:17,020
I will see the choices within my hands.

595
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:24,740
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

596
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,980
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

597
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,780
Do you feel the storm approach?

598
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,560
As the end draws near.

599
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,620
When heavens divide.

600
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:47,100
Time will come to softly lay me down.

601
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:54,720
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

602
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,240
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

603
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,520
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

604
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,440
When heavens divide.

605
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:40,630
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

606
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,890
When heavens divide.

607
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,750
Yay!

608
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,650
Heavens divide!

609
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,570
Yay!

610
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,110
Christmas!

611
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,090
Yay!

612
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:05,930
Christmas!

613
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,350
Yay!

614
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,010
Christmas!

615
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,210
Sound Christmas.

616
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:12,930
I'm trying to think.

617
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,450
I mean, I guess it's fine if I sing things I sang last time.

618
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,170
It's fine if I sing whatever I want.

619
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,290
Sing whatever I want.

620
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,470
Long time lurker whisperer.

621
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,590
Last year's songs really got me in the Christmas spirit.

622
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,930
I know you're feeling grinchy but your streams grew my heart three whole sizes.

623
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,710
Thank you!

624
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,570
Merry Christmas!

625
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,370
Have you listened to Mistress for Christmas by AC?

626
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,070
Wait, no.

627
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,110
I don't think I know that one.

628
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,570
Maybe I do, but I'm not sure.

629
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,850
If Die Hard is a Christmas movie, that's a Christmas song.

630
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,150
So true!

631
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,310
So true.

632
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,150
So true.

633
00:51:59,390 --> 00:51:59,950
Sorry.

634
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,050
I'm trying to think.

635
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,310
No, I'm not going to do break stuff tonight, you guys.

636
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,990
My voice, I don't think, can handle it.

637
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,390
I did break stuff literally this month.

638
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,590
Give me a break stuff.

639
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:22,990
Give me a break stuff.

640
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,710
Heaven's Divide is my most favorite MGS song.

641
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,130
I don't know, I always switch between...

642
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,770
Smash Boo, thanks for the 10 gifted.

643
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,150
I was going to say me too, but also...

644
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,510
Twice this month.

645
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:38,810
Twice this month.

646
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,810
Give me a break.

647
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:40,870
Give me a break.

648
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,690
Mellow soft break stuff.

649
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,350
I don't think I can.

650
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,570
I don't think it's in me.

651
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,170
When break stuff happens...

652
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,030
I become... I turn red.

653
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,870
I see red, you know?

654
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,770
I see red.

655
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,690
I can't, it just comes out.

656
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,030
Merry Chrysler, Merry Chrysler!

657
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,170
Merry Chrysler.

658
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,390
Are Doki songs from the concert still stuck in your head?

659
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,110
Sing them now.

660
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,260
I don't think I... wait.

661
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,020
Oh Panda, thank you for the 50 gifted.

662
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,800
Thank you!

663
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:55,510
How bad can I be?

664
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,890
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

665
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,330
How bad can I be?

666
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,450
How bad can I possibly be?

667
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:25,810
Well there's a principle of nature That almost every creature knows Called survival of the fittest And check it, this is how it goes The animal that wins gotta scratch and fight and claw and bite and punch And the animal that doesn't, well the animal that doesn't Wines up someone else's lunch I don't know this song.

668
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,870
How bad can I be?

669
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,750
I'm just doing what comes naturally How bad can I be?

670
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,670
I'm just following my destiny How bad can I be?

671
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,470
I'm just doing what comes naturally How bad can I be?

672
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,550
How bad can I possibly be?

673
00:54:46,550 --> 00:55:07,310
Well there's a principle in business That everybody knows the sound It says the people with the money Make this ever-loving world go round So I'm bigger in my company, I'm bigger in my factory I'm bigger in my corporate side Everybody out there, you take care of yours and me I'll take care of mine,

674
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:26,270
mine, mine, mine, mine Shake that bottom line Smoke Schlappity schlap Complaining all you want is never ever ever gonna stop Come on, how bad can I possibly How bad can I be?

675
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,090
I'm just building the economy How bad can I be?

676
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:36,170
Just look at me petting this puppy How bad can I be?

677
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,890
How bad can I be?

678
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,770
How bad can I possibly be?

679
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,590
Let's see How bad can I be?

680
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:50,550
All the customers are buying How bad can I be?

681
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,490
And the money is multiplying How bad can I be?

682
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,870
And the PR people are lying How bad

683
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,250
can I be?

684
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:10,180
Who cares if a few trees are dying How bad can I be?

685
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,320
This is all so gratifying How bad

686
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,770
This song is so dumb

687
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,830
Oh my god

688
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,550
Do I have to put that on my set list?

689
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:44,490
You know what, it's fine How bad can I be?

690
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:59,630
My voice is a little squeakerton today, I'm sorry I'm so squeaky today I sound like Pies when she gets mad at me Well not mad at me, she just comes up to me and she's always

691
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,410
Is that mint before a merch drop?

692
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:15,030
I have had one merch drop Mito-chan that wasn't very green vtuber coded of you, I know, I'm sorry I'm sorry

693
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,790
I'm sorry Pies is a squeaker?

694
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:27,050
Oh my god, the squeakiest She is so squeaky Hey Mito can we get a Godzilla sound?

695
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:52,150
My birthday was on the 19th but work was on so I couldn't get you to stream No!

696
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,610
Any chance I can get a brief song so I can hear your Disney song of choice?

00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:30,330
Please

719
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,910
Hold on, let me check if this is OK

720
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:58,210
I don't know the words at all to this I don't know anything of this song OK everybody, this is from the new Mufasa movie It's called

721
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:25,590
I Always Wanted a Brother I'm

722
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,020
crying I

723
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,120
have not stopped singing Thank you for another 50!

724
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,720
Thank you so much!

725
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,140
I really appreciate it!

726
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,440
OK hold on, let me get the lyrics I always wanted a brother

727
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,790
I'm sorry, I don't know how this song goes at all except the chorus

728
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,920
Disney, you put up the instrumental yourself so don't get mad at me, OK?

729
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:51,280
If this is what claims the video I might lose it When does it come in?

730
01:01:52,060 --> 01:02:13,440
When I am king, no other animal will break my stride, break my stride And my brother, my brother When I'm king, you'll always take my side, yeah right I'm totally improvising this, I don't know if you can tell When I'm king, when you are king, no other animal will break our pride,

731
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:22,700
break our pride And my brother, my brother Our pray may run away, but they can't hide Watch her hide, let's go!

732
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,140
Oh, let's go!

733
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,600
Hey, did your mama say you could be out this late?

734
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:36,320
OK, she didn't say, either way Hey, did your father say you could be out this far?

735
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:44,440
OK, we're on our way, on our way Hey, did your mama say you could be out...

736
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,820
It's coming, you guys.

737
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,060
I see it in the lyrics

738
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,380
Make a wish on a brightest star, and I say, I always...

739
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,370
Please explain the funny

740
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,710
OK OK

741
01:03:52,270 --> 01:04:09,670
It started in October When I watched the trailer for the Mufasa movie And there was a line in it that just got me Because it was just so awkward

742
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,470
And...

743
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:32,770
It's like, I always wanted a brother And then for some reason, oh gosh, now I'm explaining the joke And people are gonna be like, this is not funny at all

744
01:04:39,510 --> 01:05:10,550
And then they said it again, they're like, I always wanted a brother Oh my god, I posted it on Twitter And then literally, like, three nights ago Like, just very recently Again, this started in October and it's been stuck in my head since then Like, three days ago I discovered that the awkward line that they used in the trailer was actually part of this stupid song And it's just the way that they say,

745
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:18,190
I always wanted a brother I always wanted a brother I can't stop saying it

746
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:32,700
I can't stop saying it Oh, it's so terrible Oh, it's so terrible, it sounds so bad

747
01:05:43,290 --> 01:06:11,910
Okay, I got it out of my system Okay My tears, my shirt is wet because I've been wiping my tears I always wanted a brother Just look it up Just listen to it Obviously I can't or Disney will strike me down I always wanted a brother I always wanted a brother I always wanted a brother

748
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:22,600
I can't stop saying it Where are my background singers at?

749
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,320
Wait, wasn't that a Christmas song?

750
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,620
The background singer song?

751
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,800
Wait, where are my backup singers at?

752
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,300
What was she saying?

753
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Oh, this Christmas!

754
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,720

Okay, I'm cool, I'm calm.

The

01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:16,690
fireside is blazing bright.

768
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:22,190
We're caroling through the night.

769
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,510
And this is the second one.

770
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,730
I had something stuck in my throat.

771
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:31,870
A very special Christmas for me.

772
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:34,310
Because

773
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,360
I'm here.

774
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,020
Shake a hand for our singers.

775
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,380
Where's your brother?

776
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,510
Oh, she's saying boo.

777
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,500
Goodness gracious.

778
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,520
There were actually no backup singers in that.

779
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,360
I'm really upset about it.

780
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,960
Thank you for the five gifted.

781
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,840
My voice is so bad today.

782
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,100
I'm so sorry, you guys.

783
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,960
I'm always blown away by your singing voice.

784
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,380
Liquid, don't say that.

785
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,500
I literally... I flopped.

786
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,440
My voice is like...

787
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,480
I can't... Oh gosh.

788
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,260
When I'm in Japan, I'm not gonna talk to anybody.

789
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,300
I'm just gonna be like... I'm gonna be so silent.

790
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Hopefully my voice will recover.

791
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,240
Hopefully.

792
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,600
Hopefully, hopefully.

793
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,940
What's a song that I can actually sing?

794
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:34,980
Morita!

795
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,780
Oh my gosh, thank you!

796
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,940
Merry Christmas, Aki!

797
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,120
Thank you!

798
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,140
Merry Christmas!

799
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,840
I appreciate it.

800
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,940
Even when you're not in tip-top shape, we're still having fun.

801
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,160
Yeah, we're here for fun.

802
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,640
We're here for fun.

803
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,820
No matter how your voice comes out, it's perfect.

804
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,740
Thank you!

805
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,940
Okay, we were supposed to sing a Disney song.

806
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,560
You guys said a bunch and I got distracted by the Lion King.

807
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,560
I'm sorry.

808
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,740
Okay, I'm gonna sing a real... Hold on.

809
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,310
Beauty and the Beast.

810
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,170
Actually...

811
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:19,770
I do have a favorite Beauty and the Beast song.

812
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,660
I wonder if I can sing it though.

813
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,320
I wonder if I can sing it though with my voice.

814
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:28,920
I'll try.

815
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,740
I'll be scuffed.

816
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,620
So sorry.

817
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,160
I can't... I've been muting and clearing my throat so bad.

818
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,940
Oh wait, there is a Beauty and the Beast song too.

819
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,200
That's another... That's actually a Christmas song.

820
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:37,570
I was the one who had it all I was the master of my fate I never needed anybody in my life I learned the truth too late I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear.

821
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:48,490
Now I know she'll never leave me, Even as she runs away.

822
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:58,630
She will still torment me, Calm me, hurt me, move me, come what may.

823
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:08,230
Wasting in my lonely tower, Waning by an open door.

824
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:17,650
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in, And be with me forevermore.

825
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:28,270
I rage against the trials of love, I curse the fading of the light.

826
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:38,050
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach, She's never out of sight.

827
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:49,610
Now I know she'll never leave me, Even as she fades from view.

828
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:58,850
She will still inspire me, Be a part of everything I do.

829
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:08,670
Wasting in my lonely tower, Waning by an open door.

830
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:24,850
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in, And as the long, long nights begin, I'll think of all that might have been, Waiting here for...

831
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:44,910
Oh my goodness.

832
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,250
I think I might have to go get a... what's it called?

833
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,130
Oh my gosh, I forgot to update the setlist.

834
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,350
Just ignore the last couple of songs.

835
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,510
Just ignore the last couple of songs.

836
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:59,430
I might have to go grab a... what's it called?

837
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:03,830
I had a cough drop, but I think I'm gonna have to take some other stuff.

838
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,730
I'm so phlegmy, that's the issue.

839
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,710
I'm so phlegmy.

840
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,250
I'm in awe, thank you!

841
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,530
Thank you.

842
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,130
I'm gonna put it in my tea.

843
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,270
Some stuff in my tea that should help.

844
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,650
Some menthol-y stuff.

845
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,050
The Chinese medicine, yeah!

846
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,270
I need it.

847
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,530
I don't have it in here, I gotta leave it in my kitchen.

848
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,470
Okay, hold on.

849
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:28,410
Give me one second.

850
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,610
I'm so sorry.

851
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,490
Listen to the Christmas music.

852
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,670
Listen to the Christmas music.

853
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,150
I'm back.

854
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,490
I'm back with my medicine.

855
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,770
I'm back.

856
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:13,610
I'm back.

857
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:19,850
What's a Christmas song?

858
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:38,740
Chestnuts roasting.

859
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,240
That is a Christmas song.

860
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,460
That is a Christmas song.

861
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,640
I'm gonna do this one other Beauty and the Beast song, since I thought of it earlier.

862
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,920
Joy, thank you for the pink!

863
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,840
I think this is... wait, I need... wait.

864
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:13,620
There's something sweet and almost kind.

865
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:17,520
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined.

866
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,800
And now he's dear and so unsure.

867
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,920
I wonder why I didn't see it there before.

868
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,700
Wait, is there no Beast part?

869
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,500
Wait, there's no extra voice that can do the Beast.

870
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,360
I have to sing the Beast!

871
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,520
Myself?

872
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,500
Okay, here we go.

873
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,320
She glanced this way.

874
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,080
I thought I saw.

875
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,020
And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw.

876
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,900
No, it can't be.

877
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,620
I'll just ignore.

878
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,560
But then she's never looked at me this way before.

879
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,660
Glory!

880
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:10,120
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?

881
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:17,880
True, that he's no Prince Charming.

882
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:25,040
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see.

883
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,820
Well, who'd have thought?

884
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,820
Well, bless my soul.

885
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:29,700
Well, who'd have known?

886
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,620
Well, who indeed?

887
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:31,600
And who'd have guessed?

888
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,620
They'd come together on their own.

889
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,540
It's so peculiar.

890
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,540
Wait and see.

891
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,540
A few days more.

892
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,420
There may be something there that wasn't there before.

893
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,120
You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.

894
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,600
What is it?

895
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,840
Something there that wasn't there before.

896
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,140
What is it?

897
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,400
I'll tell you when you're older, Chip.

898
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,840
That was something there from Beauty and the Beast.

899
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,780
The paw line when she didn't shudder at my paw is so funny.

900
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,520
Mama, what's a furry?

901
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,340
Once upon a December.

902
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,800
Oh yeah, we'll do that one too.

903
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,780
Once upon a December.

904
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,340
I just woke up and got jumpscared by my R on your thumbnail.

905
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,220
My!

906
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,280
Thank you!

907
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,860
My R tag is like broken for me and I have that in my bookmarks.

908
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,480
I sometimes bookmark art that I want to use for thumbnails.

909
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:00,000
But I also bookmark a lot of other things too and I forget to scroll through.

910
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,860
So I was scrolling because I can't see it through my R tag right now.

911
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,720
And I saw it from so long ago and I was like, yeah!

912
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,980
Once upon a December.

913
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:20,130
Someone holds me safe and warm Horses dance through a silver storm Figures dancing gracefully Across my memory

914
01:23:52,080 --> 01:24:42,080
Someone holds me safe and warm Horses prance through a silver storm Figures dancing gracefully Across my memory Far away, long ago Glowing dim as an ember Things my heart used to know Things it yearns to remember And a song someone sings

915
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,340
That song's hard.

916
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,280
That song's hard to sing.

917
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,040
Thank you.

918
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,040
Thanks for singing my favorite song from my favorite movie, Rendition of the Beautiful.

919
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:23,840
Thank you!

920
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,960
I'm glad you liked it.

921
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

922
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,560
Appreciate it.

923
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,040
Thank you guys for all the donos.

924
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:41,100
Thank you for all the memberships, all the donated memberships, or gifted memberships.

925
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:42,380
I really appreciate it.

926
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:49,140
If you're, if by chance you're taking requests, I'd love to hear, perfect by smashing pumpkins.

927
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,020
I don't know if I know it.

928
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:52,880
Hold on, let me see.

929
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,980
Perfect by smashing pumpkin.

930
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,760
Hold on, I'm gonna listen to it.

931
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,140
Oh, let me listen to it.

932
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,720
I'm listening, I'm listening.

933
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:29,800
Oh, I do know this song, but I don't know if I know it well enough to sing it.

934
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,780
I'm sorry, I don't know.

935
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,700
Maybe I'll, let me add it to my list.

936
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,860
Hold on.

937
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,440
I've been, Songs to Learn.

938
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:51,580
I have a, I have a, I have my own like private discord, like personal, you know, just for like notes and stuff for myself.

939
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,920
And I, I have a, I have now a channel called Songs to Learn.

940
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:06,980
So, I add things on there when you guys request it and I don't know it.

941
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:15,040
So that I can go back and be like, oh, because I feel like I sing so many of the same songs sometimes.

942
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,360
Is it a long list?

943
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,020
Well, I only did it recently.

944
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:23,760
So, I only started it recently.

945
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,740
So it's kind of a, not the longest list.

946
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:37,620
Oh my gosh, I want to sing this song because I want to sing it.

947
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,480
I thought of it the other night and I was like, oh wait, I like this song.

948
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,870
It's not a Christmas song, so, but that's okay.

949
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:57,230
I've never sung this song, I think, before in karaoke, so that's good.

950
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:51,520
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

951
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:07,680
My arms, I just wanted to hold you in my arms,

952
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:23,610
all the souls that would die just to feel alive.

953
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:35,810
But I'll never let you go if you promise not to fade away, never.

954
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,590
Our

955
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:54,590
hopes and expectations, black holes and revelations.

956
01:29:57,050 --> 01:30:00,650
Our hopes and expectations,

957
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:08,090
black holes and revelations.

958
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:41,310
Oh, the ship is taking me far away.

959
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:09,550
Merry Christmas, thank you.

960
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:13,570
Thank you guys so much.

961
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:16,290
Oh, now I'm scrolling up, I think I saw some more, but they disappeared.

962
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:16,830
Where'd they go?

963
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,310
No, oh no, no.

964
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,330
Flora, Merry Christmas.

965
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,950
It was amazing, thank you.

966
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

967
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:33,950
Merry Christmas, Midtime Lurker, but I always love hearing your singing.

968
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,210
Thank you, Blaster.

969
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:38,730
Could we get a little dive with a smile as a treat?

970
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:41,030
I can try.

971
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:46,530
Don't be alarmed, but I think I saw a suspicious-looking gift box moving by itself outside your house.

972
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:48,230
It had legs under it.

973
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,630
It's crazy that they wrote this song and Snow Halation.

974
01:32:58,190 --> 01:32:58,570
Wait, what?

975
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:00,190
Oh, shut up.

976
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,010
I was like, what are you talking about?

977
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:12,110
Merry Christmas, Minto and the Wiz.

978
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,230
Thank you, before I go...

979
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:17,710
But I have to go, but before that, I just want to thank you for everything and help you enjoy your trip.

980
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,230
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

981
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,270
Dive with a smile.

982
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,640
Whose part should I be?

983
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:37,540
Maybe I'll do... I'll do Bruno when he's lead and I'll do Lady Gaga when she's lead.

984
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,560
So strict!

985
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:40,320
Thanks for the 10k!

986
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,840
I survived, I realized.

987
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,280
Wherever you go, though, that's where I'll follow.

988
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,540
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

989
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:18,580
So I'mma love you every night like it's the last night, like it's the last night.

990
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:25,460
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

991
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:41,400
If the party was over and our time on earth was through, I'd want to hold you just for a while.

992
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:45,900
And dive with a smile.

993
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,840
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

994
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:50,840
If the party was over and our time on earth was through, I'd want to hold you just for a while.

995
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,480
Oh my god, sudden Bruno Mars.

996
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:06,030
Lost, lost in the words that we scream.

997
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:10,850
I don't even want to do this anymore.

998
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:15,030
Cause you already know what you mean to me.

999
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:20,270
And I'm lost, the only one worth fighting for.

1000
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:24,970
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.

1001
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:29,250
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

1002
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:36,130
So I'mma love you every night like it's the last night, like it's the last night.

1003
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:43,270
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

1004
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:58,670
If the party was over and our time on earth was through, I'd want to hold you just for a while.

1005
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:02,890
And dive with a smile.

1006
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:11,970
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

1007
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:14,670
Right next to you.

1008
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:19,530
Next to you.

1009
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:24,670
Right next to you.

1010
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:51,630
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

1011
01:36:53,390 --> 01:37:07,570
If the party was over and our time on earth was through, I'd want to hold you just for a while.

1012
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:11,810
And dive with a smile.

1013
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:18,530
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

1014
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:27,690
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

1015
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:37,400
I'd want to be next to you.

1016
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:42,060
Yeah!

1017
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,960
That was...

1018
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,300
Dive with a smile.

1019
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,480
Pegasus, thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

1020
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,880
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

1021
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,400
Thank you guys so much!

1022
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1023
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,000
Oh my goodness.

1024
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,680
Merry Christmas Minto, you rock!

1025
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:02,360
You rock!

1026
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,040
Sleepy Otter, thank you!

1027
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,740
Thank you, thank you!

1028
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,920
Could you please sing Bad Applebottom Jeans?

1029
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:12,340
Wait, how is there a Bad Applebottom?

1030
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,880
Also take Snow Halation by Shawty's Like a Melody.

1031
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,920
I don't even know that one.

1032
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:18,480
Wait.

1033
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,680
Bad...

1034
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,180
How do I...

1035
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:32,260
Applebottom jeans, white boots with the fur, the whole club is looking at her.

1036
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:36,680
I don't know the rest of the song.

1037
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,040
It's fine on the outside.

1038
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,960
Maybe, I can sing that one.

1039
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,500
Marissa, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1040
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,860
Erin Copper, welcome to membership!

1041
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:46,820
Thank you!

1042
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1043
01:38:52,840 --> 01:39:01,400
Applebottom jeans, white boots with the fur, Shawty got the whole club looking at her.

1044
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,380
Is that how it goes?

1045
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,080
I don't know one.

1046
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,740
I don't know that one.

1047
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,460
My happy arrived in time for Christmas!

1048
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:21,500
I'm glad I made it!

1049
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,500
There goes Stalker.

1050
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:23,860
Toho, hi Jack.

1051
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,380
What kind of Toho song?

1052
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,180
Toho, Toho, I wonder.

1053
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,960
Wouldn't it be crazy if Carophone had Bad Apple?

1054
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,100
Oh, I'm just getting apples.

1055
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:43,540
What do elves post on social media?

1056
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:44,940
Elfies.

1057
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,220
Stop.

1058
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,900
Stop it, Eric.

1059
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,820
Throwing in my shot for Twilight.

1060
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,100
I love Twilight.

1061
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,560
I don't know if I can sing it today though, Karateko.

1062
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,780
I think my voice is not up to speed.

1063
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,360
Let me see.

1064
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,800
I wonder if it has this.

1065
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:07,520
That would be so funny.

1066
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,740
No, but I can still sing it.

1067
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:22,090
I'll try.

1068
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:24,090
Wait, no.

1069
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:28,130
No, this isn't the song that was Applebottom Jeans.

1070
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,030
I don't think.

1071
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,910
NobGoblin, thanks for the 5 gifters!

1072
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,110
Thank you!

1073
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,590
Thank you so much.

1074
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:41,050
Whatever, I can just do it properly.

1075
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:42,830
I'll just do it properly.

1076
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:37,600
初めて出会った時から予感に騒ぐ 心のメロディ 止められない止まらない

1077
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:50,100
何故届けて切なさには Annihilation

1078
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:38,760
I'm going to sing a song called, 「I'm going to run to the future right

1079
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:53,310
now.

1080
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:55,550
I want to hold you.

1081
01:42:56,850 --> 01:43:00,370
Wherever you are, wherever you are.

1082
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:05,880
Come on, before I know it.

1083
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:11,520
I've grown too big.

1084
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,260
I've grown too big.

1085
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,160
It's like I'm only dreaming.

1086
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,420
It's painful.

1087
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,260
I want to be your lover.

1088
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,800
I'm confused by your kind eyes.

1089
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:29,480
I don't like it.

1090
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:33,260
I'm going to give you all my love.

1091
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,330
Give it to me, please.

1092
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:07,140
I'm going to put my name on the pain of delivering.

1093
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:09,200
No hurry shot.

1094
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,400
Until the feelings overlap,

1095
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,800
I don't wait.

1096
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,860
It's frustrating, but it's okay to love.

1097
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,260
Don't hesitate in the heat.

1098
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:55,130
Yeah!

1099
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:57,850
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1100
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:01,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1101
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:05,190
I've sung it properly for the first time in a long time.

1102
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:07,750
I always end up singing the Flintstones.

1103
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:09,510
Merry Christmas!

1104
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:10,390
Advocate!

1105
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:11,710
Thank you for the Hakusuba!

1106
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:12,870
Merry Christmas!

1107
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,590
Nerdy Laundry, thank you so much for the tangata!

1108
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,390
Thank you!

1109
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:22,750
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.

1110
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:24,790
They're your modern stone age family.

1111
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,850
From the town of Bedrock.

1112
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:30,310
Happy Holidays everyone.

1113
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,250
Happy Holidays!

1114
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,410
Thank you Jody!

1115
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:35,910
Thank you for the tonigata!

1116
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:36,590
Thank you!

1117
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,690
It's a Christmas miracle.

1118
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:45,170
Was that not the official lyrics?

1119
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,990
It should be, right?

1120
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:51,150
It's been like poison in my brain to do the Flintstones version.

1121
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,930
Vector-san, thank you for the tonigata!

1122
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:54,910
Thank you!

1123
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:57,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1124
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,110
This Christmas...

1125
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:03,990
I did do this Christmas earlier.

1126
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:07,850
But I kind of messed it up.

1127
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:08,650
I don't want to do it again.

1128
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:09,190
I'm embarrassed.

1129
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,110
Thanks for the five gifted.

1130
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:18,990
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1131
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:19,510
Oh my gosh.

1132
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:20,050
Damnit!

1133
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:20,970
Thank you for the ten gifted.

1134
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:22,490
Oh my goodness, goodness, goodness.

1135
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:23,630
Thank you, thank you guys.

1136
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:23,970
Thank you.

1137
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:29,030
No backup singers.

1138
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,670
Ah, there are no backup singers.

1139
01:46:32,290 --> 01:46:32,770
Sad.

1140
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,150
Need to get back to family.

1141
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:38,670
But Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas Nora!

1142
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:39,890
Thanks for hanging out!

1143
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,350
Eternal snow?

1144
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,790
Yeah, we can do that one.

1145
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:48,870
Eto!

1146
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:50,070
Thanks for the ten gifted.

1147
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:51,750
You missed my super chat request.

1148
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:54,270
Still good to hear snow-holation by the way.

1149
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,490
Oh, sorry!

1150
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,250
It's like hard to see sometimes.

1151
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:58,350
I'm sorry!

1152
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:00,570
What was it?

1153
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,430
You can say it in chat.

1154
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:05,690
I still read the chat, you know, for suggestions too.

1155
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:14,130
Some of my friends got forced to stop lifting by security when Phoebe was singing that's a phantom thief's revenge even though the rules were lift at your own risk.

1156
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:18,610
Unfortunately, well, it is your own risk.

1157
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:27,330
Unfortunately, you know, security doesn't always align with our beliefs.

1158
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:30,530
John, thank you for the fifty gifted!

1159
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,570
Thank you!

1160
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:33,190
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted!

1161
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:33,870
Thank you!

1162
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:36,030
Kairu, welcome to the membership!

1163
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:36,850
Thank you!

1164
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:38,670
You read chat?

1165
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:40,110
No, I never read chat.

1166
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:45,510
A super chat is asking for another Vocaloid winter song.

1167
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:49,730
Oh, Snowman by HALO-C.

1168
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:51,450
I don't know, I don't think I know that one.

1169
01:47:55,590 --> 01:48:04,010
I can try, oh gosh, I don't want to sing, I'm going to be in, what's the word?

1170
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:14,830
In Aura's Christmas, in her Christmas, she has a big Christmas concert.

1171
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:19,110
And I don't want to sing the one I sang in that.

1172
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,850
Another Christmas Vocaloid.

1173
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:26,570
Don't ever read my chat asking for Lips of an Angel again.

1174
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:27,930
I don't want to sing Lips of an Angel!

1175
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:31,110
I don't want to sing it today!

1176
01:48:35,530 --> 01:48:36,630
When the first love ends?

1177
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,910
That's the one I was thinking of.

1178
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:41,110
So let me do Eternal Snow first and then I'll do...

1179
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:43,430
What's the Japanese?

1180
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,790
There, I got it.

1181
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:53,750
I got it.

1182
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:57,410
I got it.

1183
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:00,550
Okay, okay, let me check this real quick.

1184
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,210
I hope it's not so crunchy.

1185
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:07,420
Okay, this sounds fun.

1186
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:57,420
Oh

1187
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,500
Tears won't stop.

1188
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:07,660
I wish I didn't know about you.

1189
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:29,750
How long will I keep thinking about you?

1190
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:30,530
I wonder if it's true.

1191
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:39,230
The sigh clouded the window glass.

1192
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:58,870
With a candle that lights up my shaking heart, I wonder if I can melt it now.

1193
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:04,730
Hold me tight.

1194
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:09,930
Hold me strong enough to break.

1195
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:18,090
Even if I stumble, I hope it won't be cold.

1196
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,690
I miss you.

1197
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:26,070
Every time I think of you.

1198
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,030
This scarf that I can't knit.

1199
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:37,250
I'll hold it alone tonight.

1200
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:54,050
If there is snow that falls forever, this feeling that continues with you.

1201
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:59,910
I wonder if I can hide this feeling.

1202
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:05,270
Hold me tight.

1203
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:16,090
If it's a feeling like this, I didn't want to know the feeling of falling in love with someone.

1204
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,810
I didn't want to know.

1205
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:23,570
I love you.

1206
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:30,610
I want to shout to the winter sky that rises in my heart.

1207
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:37,270
I want to see you right now.

1208
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:26,330
She loves us.

1209
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:28,670
I don't get to twist it now, okay?

1210
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,390
Also...

1211
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:34,090
Oh no, I lost.

1212
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:35,370
I'm trying to click it.

1213
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:36,510
Oh gosh.

1214
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:43,690
Eternal snow made me cry my eyes out back in high school and changed the trajectory of my life forever.

1215
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:44,990
Oh my gosh.

1216
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,730
I kind of have a similar story though.

1217
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:50,310
Because...

1218
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:53,310
A long time ago...

1219
01:54:53,310 --> 01:55:01,310
One of the bodies I frequently possessed would get sick very often.

1220
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:03,510
And like...

1221
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:08,670
They like...

1222
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:11,170
Felt very connected.

1223
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:12,370
What's the main character's name?

1224
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:13,110
Mitsuki, I think.

1225
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:14,990
They felt so connected to her.

1226
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:17,430
They were just like, oh my god, she's so much like me.

1227
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:18,770
I'm dying.

1228
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:21,250
She's dying.

1229
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:23,610
So...

1230
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:26,810
Hopefully, that body I possess is okay.

1231
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:34,190
Mitsuki's story was so inspirational.

1232
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:34,770
I know!

1233
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:39,090
We're all dying.

1234
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:39,630
Technically.

1235
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,090
Well, I'm already dead.

1236
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,390
If you're alive, you're technically dying.

1237
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:47,690
Let's see...

1238
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,250
This song.

1239
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:50,630
Let me check it.

1240
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:53,970
Let me check it, let me check it, let me check it, check it, check it.

1241
01:55:58,110 --> 01:55:58,890
This should be good.

1242
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:02,730
This was...

1243
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:05,170
Miku's song.

1244
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,640
Nah, I'd leave.

1245
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,310
Ah...

1246
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:32,210
It's like a drama.

1247
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,330
It's like a love story.

1248
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:41,170
As if I had foreseen it, the bell of gratitude rang.

1249
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:57,840
The cold winter wind almost woke me up.

1250
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,580
I breathed out and rubbed my hands.

1251
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,760
The city was illuminated.

1252
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:08,320
I cast a spell.

1253
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:12,360
Every time, the streetlights were bare.

1254
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:16,880
I couldn't say it no matter what.

1255
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,800
I suppressed my feelings.

1256
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,420
I suppressed my feelings.

1257
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:27,440
I hadn't made up my mind.

1258
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:35,510
If

1259
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:44,160
I stop, I'll remember.

1260
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:47,040
So, thank you.

1261
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:48,280
Goodbye.

1262
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:49,280
I won't cry.

1263
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,480
That's what I thought.

1264
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,800
It's like a dream.

1265
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:58,460
That's how I felt.

1266
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:02,260
When I touched it, it melted and disappeared.

1267
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:20,450
The two of us, It's like we're having fun.

1268
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:22,870
Look, it's the first snow.

1269
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:27,770
I wanted to be like that with you.

1270
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:33,630
I made a hand-knit scarf for the first time.

1271
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:37,910
I don't know why I gave it to you.

1272
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:38,930
I'm a coward.

1273
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:42,070
I was just afraid.

1274
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:45,470
If it's a memory,

1275
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:49,640
I'll cry.

1276
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,200
I

1277
01:58:58,370 --> 01:59:07,090
should have known Thank you.

1278
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:14,880
The train is coming.

1279
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:20,640
It hurts me now.

1280
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:25,280
I want to be with you.

1281
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,280
How much do I have

1282
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:05,210
to wish?

1283
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:09,370
I know that.

1284
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:13,170
You're being nice to me.

1285
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:17,550
So let go of my hand.

1286
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:22,210
I'm glad I met you.

1287
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:25,470
I like you.

1288
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:27,090
Thank you.

1289
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:28,270
Goodbye.

1290
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:30,390
I can't say a word.

1291
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:32,530
Just for now.

1292
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:34,650
Courage to me.

1293
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:37,670
Hey, I'm just saying.

1294
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:40,810
I'm sorry.

1295
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:41,810
I don't remember how far I got.

1296
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:42,130
I'm sorry.

1297
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:45,310
It's okay to cry just for now.

1298
02:00:47,390 --> 02:00:49,570
I don't need words anymore.

1299
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:52,610
Please hold me tight.

1300
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:11,970
What kind of me is there now?

1301
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:16,590
What kind of you is there now?

1302
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,990
Sorry, I forgot that part.

1303
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:28,550
Oops.

1304
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:37,620
Oh my goodness.

1305
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,180
I missed out on some...

1306
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:41,560
Sorry, some donuts too.

1307
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,100
Thank you for the Akadono.

1308
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,620
I hope you have a happy holiday.

1309
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,200
You too.

1310
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,640
Thank you so much.

1311
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:49,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1312
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,400
A cracked apple is on your list.

1313
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,000
A cracked apple.

1314
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,340
Wait, hold on.

1315
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:57,560
That was...

1316
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,620
That was...

1317
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:03,760
The first...

1318
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:08,660
When the first love ends.

1319
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,500
The first...

1320
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:18,380
You know I may not get what I want for Christmas.

1321
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:20,180
But I won't give up.

1322
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:22,900
Perseverance.

1323
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:24,420
Perseverance.

1324
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,200
Run it from Sonic Movie 3.

1325
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:28,820
I haven't even seen Sonic 3, Jacob.

1326
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:33,180
I haven't even seen it.

1327
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,980
It's possible to do Last Christmas.

1328
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,440
My last attempt to request goodbye days.

1329
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,460
Goodbye days like...

1330
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:48,950
If P2W even works.

1331
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:50,590
Oh my god, stop.

1332
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:53,010
Don't act like that.

1333
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:54,150
Don't be like that.

1334
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:55,870
I'm sorry if I miss it.

1335
02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:56,730
I'm sorry.

1336
02:02:58,910 --> 02:02:59,830
I don't...

1337
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:02,410
I'm sorry.

1338
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:04,550
Please don't guilt me if I miss something.

1339
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:05,890
It makes me so sad.

1340
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:13,190
Especially if you're spending so much money.

1341
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:15,110
And I don't know the song.

1342
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:16,650
I'm gonna feel so bad, you know.

1343
02:03:20,290 --> 02:03:24,270
It's best to, you know, not donate song requests.

1344
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,290
Because, you know...

1345
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:28,170
I might not always know the song.

1346
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:30,210
And then you'll be like, oh, I spent the money.

1347
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:32,610
I sent the money, and she doesn't know the song.

1348
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:33,270
I'm sorry.

1349
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,230
I'm so sorry.

1350
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:40,650
But I don't... I only know the...

1351
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:42,270
Goodbye days...

1352
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:44,030
Also, it helps to send...

1353
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:45,110
This is for everybody too.

1354
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:47,950
It helps to also send who the artist is.

1355
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:51,910
Because sometimes there are lots of songs that are the same...

1356
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:54,410
The same title, you know what I mean?

1357
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:55,490
So...

1358
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:58,250
Just in general, I think that's a...

1359
02:03:58,250 --> 02:03:58,630
If you're...

1360
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:03,370
Say, if you're even with another streamer who's taking song requests too.

1361
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:04,610
Then...

1362
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:06,950
Then you can...

1363
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:10,370
Then they'll know exactly what it is.

1364
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:12,050
It doesn't need to be in Kyrofun.

1365
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:12,670
It doesn't.

1366
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:13,230
It doesn't.

1367
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:14,530
No, no, no.

1368
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:17,490
So yeah.

1369
02:04:20,330 --> 02:04:21,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1370
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:21,650
Wait.

1371
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:22,990
Oh, oh, oh.

1372
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:24,670
Dogdog, thank you for the hakusuba!

1373
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:26,290
There's now a cream bowl here!

1374
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,110
I won't really celebrate, but I wanted to give you a gift.

1375
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:29,610
Thank you!

1376
02:04:29,950 --> 02:04:30,930
Thank you for the hakusuba!

1377
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:32,790
Cold December night.

1378
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:35,590
Michael... I don't know that... Cold December night.

1379
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:37,130
I don't think I know that one.

1380
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:39,510
Thank you for the hakusuba!

1381
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:40,170
Thank you!

1382
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:42,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1383
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:45,390
Oomph and I figured out you can mix to Last Christmas.

1384
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:46,230
Oh my gosh.

1385
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:48,170
Well, that's the one by Wham, right?

1386
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:48,550
Hold on.

1387
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,890
Someone requested something earlier.

1388
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:51,130
Oh gosh, what was it?

1389
02:04:52,570 --> 02:04:54,150
I mean, there's been so many requests.

1390
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:57,310
There's been so many requests.

1391
02:04:59,110 --> 02:04:59,930
What was it?

1392
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:02,630
Oh, I know there was Chestnuts.

1393
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:05,610
Can you sing this?

1394
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:06,750
Oops, it must have gotten deleted.

1395
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:08,750
Snowman by Sia.

1396
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:11,630
Sia has a snow song?

1397
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:15,410
Thank you for the five gifts at Shadow Cross!

1398
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:18,150
Sing the minky, minky, minky, minky, minky.

1399
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:27,930
There was something I wanted to sing.

1400
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:36,230
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

1401
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:38,890
I can't ever sing that song.

1402
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:40,490
That guy does it the best way.

1403
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,690
What was it?

1404
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:49,190
This one.

1405
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:49,890
Here we go.

1406
02:06:14,290 --> 02:06:17,930
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1407
02:06:18,230 --> 02:06:22,390
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1408
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:30,330
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1409
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:35,690
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1410
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:40,310
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1411
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:48,290
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1412
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:51,990
Can you mix here?

1413
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:11,450
One's bitten and twice shy.

1414
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:16,790
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.

1415
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:20,750
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?

1416
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:25,490
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.

1417
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:34,330
I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying, I love you, I meant it.

1418
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:38,010
Now I know what a fool I've been.

1419
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:42,670
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd pull me again.

1420
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:47,030
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1421
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:51,170
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1422
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:59,450
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1423
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:04,810
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1424
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:09,050
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1425
02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:17,310
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1426
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:49,990
And your soul of ice, my God, I thought you were someone to rely on.

1427
02:08:50,250 --> 02:08:54,310
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

1428
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:58,250
Face on a lover with a fire in his heart.

1429
02:08:58,830 --> 02:09:04,090
A man undercover, but you tore me apart.

1430
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:16,070
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1431
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:20,570
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1432
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:28,410
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1433
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:33,850
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1434
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:38,990
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1435
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:46,310
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1436
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:51,450
Face on a lover with a fire in his heart.

1437
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:55,790
A man undercover, but you tore me apart.

1438
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:16,620
This year, to save me from

1439
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:44,170
tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1440
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:45,010
I already typed it, my bad.

1441
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:48,790
I like them both.

1442
02:10:49,730 --> 02:10:50,090
Honestly.

1443
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:54,150
I always try to get your stream even if I'm meaning on the background.

1444
02:10:54,270 --> 02:10:54,970
Thank you, Azura!

1445
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:56,230
Thank you!

1446
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:00,750
Can you do Angelic Angel?

1447
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:06,830
You know, I'm not good at that song.

1448
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:11,610
If this will be the last karaoke for a minute, can we get one more Snake Eater for the road?

1449
02:11:11,610 --> 02:11:13,970
Well, it's definitely gonna be the last one this year.

1450
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:19,150
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1451
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:22,270
Okay, let me do some Christmas songs.

1452
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:27,790
Ding, fries are done.

1453
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:29,630
Caesar, how old are you?

1454
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:31,910
How old are you?

1455
02:11:34,950 --> 02:11:37,730
Meowie, Chrysler, Minto, can you sing Collective Christmas?

1456
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:39,570
All I want for Christmas is collective consciousness.

1457
02:11:39,570 --> 02:11:40,550
What is that?

1458
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:41,730
What are you talking about?

1459
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:44,110
No New Year karaoke?

1460
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:45,270
I won't be here.

1461
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:48,590
I won't be here.

1462
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:52,390
Wait, this is a Frank Sinatra version?

1463
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:53,170
Let's try it.

1464
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:00,970
My ears!

1465
02:12:04,270 --> 02:12:07,630
You better watch out, you better not cry.

1466
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:11,070
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.

1467
02:12:11,970 --> 02:12:15,690
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1468
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:21,310
He's making a list and checking it twice.

1469
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:24,750
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice.

1470
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:29,210
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1471
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:34,170
He sees you when you're sleeping.

1472
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:37,230
He knows when you're awake.

1473
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:41,430
He knows if you've been bad or good.

1474
02:12:41,610 --> 02:12:44,230
So be good boy, couldn't you say?

1475
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:47,910
Oh, you better not want, oh, you better not cry.

1476
02:12:48,430 --> 02:12:51,770
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.

1477
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:56,670
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1478
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:32,610
Say, you better watch out, you better not cry.

1479
02:13:32,970 --> 02:13:36,010
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.

1480
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:40,510
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1481
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:46,150
He's making a list, he's checking it twice.

1482
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:49,690
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice.

1483
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:52,310
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1484
02:13:55,690 --> 02:13:58,890
He sees you when you're sleeping.

1485
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:02,050
He knows when you're awake.

1486
02:14:02,890 --> 02:14:06,310
He knows if you've been bad or good.

1487
02:14:06,450 --> 02:14:09,130
So be good boy, couldn't you say?

1488
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:13,310
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry.

1489
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:16,830
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.

1490
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:22,290
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1491
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,660
Sorry, I was completely sight reading that.

1492
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:39,740
I didn't know that version at all.

1493
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:40,340
Oh my god.

1494
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,620
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1495
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,980
Tonight, Noel Rad is tracking him right now.

1496
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,420
You better watch out, you better watch out.

1497
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,020
Thank you for the five gift, I appreciate it.

1498
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,060
Thank you so much.

1499
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:59,100
You better watch out, you better watch out.

1500
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:02,760
It's a pretty tough year for me, but I'm glad you came back from the afterlife to haunt us again.

1501
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:03,560
Thank you officer.

1502
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,300
Thank you for all that you do.

1503
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:08,120
Thank you so much, I appreciate it.

1504

You better watch out, you better watch out.

1508
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:38,360
Thank you for the 15 gifts.

1509
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:42,480
Can you sing us the most wonderful time of the year by Andy Williams?

1510
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,460
It's my favorite Christmas song.

1511
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:44,280
I can try!

1512
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:50,290
Andy Williams, thank you.

1513
02:15:51,130 --> 02:15:53,330
I always love the super jazzy covers of Christmas classics.

1514

Thank you!

1515
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:56,230
I do too, they are so fun to sing too.

1516
02:16:22,270 --> 02:16:28,450
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1517
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:35,090
It's the hap-happiest season of all.

1518
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:42,950
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call.

1519
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:50,850
It's the hap-happiest season of all.

1520
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:57,870
There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting, and caroling out in the snow.

1521
02:16:58,390 --> 02:17:04,810
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago.

1522
02:17:06,770 --> 02:17:13,310
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1523
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:20,830
There'll be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near.

1524
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:28,290
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1525
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:41,770
There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting, and caroling out in the snow.

02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:49,150
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago.

1527
02:17:54,410 --> 02:18:00,010
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1528
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:08,730
There'll be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near.

1529
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:12,430
It's the most wonderful time.

1530
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:15,970
It's the most wonderful time.

1531
02:18:16,070 --> 02:18:22,570
Oh, the most wonderful time of the year.

1532
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:35,610

I appreciate it.

1536
02:18:40,830 --> 02:18:43,070
Sprite, why did you guys keep saying Sprite Cranberry?

1537
02:18:44,390 --> 02:18:47,110
What does this song have to do with the Sprite Cranberry?

1538
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:48,950
UpsideDownLappy, thanks for the gifted!

1539
02:18:50,670 --> 02:18:51,650
Thank you, thank you.

1540
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:54,290
What does this have to do with the Sprite Cranberry anyway?

1541
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:58,490
Want one?

1542
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:00,010
I can't drink soda.

Ask LeBron James.

1545
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:12,530
I thought you know this one, but could you add Snoopy's Christmas to your list for next year?

1546
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:16,830
I tagged you with David K's Animal Megatron Christmas Carol.

1547
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:18,070
Merry Crimbo, Minky.

1548
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:20,550
I will check it after stream.

1549
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:21,530
Why?

1550
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:23,950
I'm not gonna remember next year.

1551
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:27,270
Cornelius, welcome to membership.

1552
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:27,990

Can you do I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas?

1559
02:19:42,430 --> 02:19:43,970
I'd like to see Gremlin Mint though.

1560
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:46,570
Otherwise, I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

1561
02:19:46,990 --> 02:19:48,390
I can do a Hippopotamus.

1562
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:50,290
I already sang Santa, baby.

1563
02:19:50,410 --> 02:19:52,530
It's one embarrassing song enough.

1564
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:56,490
Have a happy... Almost Christmas means it wasn't Christmas.

1565
02:19:56,950 --> 02:19:59,110

No crocodiles or rhinoceroses.

1580
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:31,040
I only like hippopotamuses.

1581
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:34,440
And hippopotamuses like me too.

1582
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:41,980
How does he know that hippopotamuses like him?

1583
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,580
How does he know?

1584
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:54,410
How does he know?

1585
02:22:54,890 --> 02:22:55,770
How does he know?

1586
02:22:58,110 --> 02:22:59,210
Thanks for the hippo.

1587
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:01,550
Akira, welcome.

1588
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:03,410
Welcome to my bushes.

1589
02:23:03,530 --> 02:23:04,350
Thank you.

1590
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:05,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1591
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:08,550
Hold on.

1592
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:10,810
I thought I saw something.

1593
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:15,990
Call me a hippo because I like Minto.

1594
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:16,510
Stop.

1595
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:18,210
The teacher is right.

1596
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:19,830
Hippopotamus will end this girl's career.

1597
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:21,810
She will never work in this town again.

1598
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:27,030
I just don't understand this song.

1599
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:30,030
I don't understand this song to be honest.

1600
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:31,770
A hippo is an allegory for something.

1601
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:32,690
I don't know.

1602
02:23:33,350 --> 02:23:34,870
Truly, I have no idea.

1603
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,470
There was one song.

1604
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:43,290
What was it?

1605
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:45,410
Oh, someone asked for White Christmas.

1606
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:47,050
I can sing that one.

1607
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:53,130
Is it snowing where you guys are?

1608
02:23:54,130 --> 02:23:55,870
Are you having a White Christmas?

1609
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:03,390
Only rain.

1610
02:24:03,690 --> 02:24:05,090
No, it snowed all day yesterday.

1611
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:51,970
I used to know Where the treetops glisten And children listen To hear sleigh bells in the snow

1612
02:24:57,110 --> 02:25:14,930
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, with every Christmas card I write.

1613
02:25:14,930 --> 02:25:37,160
May your days be merry and bright, and may all your Christmases be white.

1614
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:40,800
Just turn that A.C.

1615
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:42,940
down.

1616
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,660
Make it so cold.

1617
02:25:47,660 --> 02:26:06,660
Just like the ones I used to know, where the treetops glisten and children listen.

1618
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:15,480
And if you don't have snow, make the snow asbestos.

1619
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:16,560
Perfect.

1620
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:35,320
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, with every Christmas card I write.

1621
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:45,540
May your days be merry and bright,

1622
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:59,180
and may all your Christmases be white.

1623
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:31,890
Just turn that A.C.

1624
02:27:32,050 --> 02:27:32,290
down.

1625
02:27:32,470 --> 02:27:32,910
Make it so cold.

1626
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,380
No, it wasn't actually true.

1627
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:43,520
What?

1628
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:44,440
Yeah.

1629
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:47,260
It wasn't real.

1630
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:48,740
Someone's dandruff.

1631
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:52,360
What was it?

1632
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:54,100
I don't remember.

1633
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,660
I don't remember what it was.

1634
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:02,400
So was the Tin Man's makeup not deadly?

1635
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:11,460
Actually, that is also... So, to say that good things happen...

1636
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:12,560
Hold on, how do I say?

1637
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:24,220
The amount of bad things that happen on the Wizard of Oz set has been greatly dramatized and exaggerated for that movie.

1638
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:29,060
I think because of just surrounding things, especially with Judy Garland and everything like that.

1639
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:32,020
I believe the first... There was two Tin Man's actually.

1640
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:33,740
I believe it was the first Tin Man.

1641
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:37,560
His makeup was deadly.

1642
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:41,120
But the second Tin Man... And he had a bad allergic reaction.

1643
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:42,720
But he was fine.

1644
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:47,160
There were rumors that he passed away because of the makeup.

1645
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:48,960
But that's not the case.

1646
02:28:51,460 --> 02:28:51,980
So...

1647
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:58,980
He was allergic, but it's not bad for most people.

1648
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:04,420
He was dead, but fine.

1649
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:05,700
No, he didn't die!

1650
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,720
He didn't die.

1651
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,340
They said that he died, but he didn't.

1652
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:14,360
Oh!

1653
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:14,740
Santa!

1654
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:19,380
Santa's here!

1655
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:22,260
Santa, thank you for the five gifted!

1656
02:29:23,220 --> 02:29:24,460
Oh my god!

1657
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:28,280
Oh my god, he died, but he got better.

1658
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:34,500
Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, am I on the good list?

1659
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:36,660
Check Mint Phantom.

1660
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:38,740
It might be under Minky.

1661
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,700
Am I on the good list or the naughty list?

1662
02:29:42,340 --> 02:29:44,500
I think I'm on the good list.

1663
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:46,560
Hold on.

1664
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:50,440
Santa...

1665
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:55,170
I'm on the freaky list.

1666
02:30:00,190 --> 02:30:01,110
Nice!

1667
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:08,200
I'm on the nice list!

1668
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:11,580
Oh my god!

1669
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:12,860
Hold on.

1670
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:25,770
Oh my god!

1671
02:30:38,810 --> 02:30:39,330
Yeah!

1672
02:30:41,790 --> 02:30:42,310
Yeah!

1673
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:44,290
It's my trophy.

1674
02:30:46,390 --> 02:30:48,570
It's like when someone hangs up their diploma.

1675
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:56,430
Yay!

1676
02:30:58,990 --> 02:31:00,510
Wow, you didn't even like it.

1677
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:02,990
I was so excited.

1678
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:03,850
Sorry Santa.

1679
02:31:03,850 --> 02:31:06,810
Can we double check that?

1680
02:31:07,210 --> 02:31:07,490
No!

1681
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,770
It's correct.

1682
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:09,950
It came from Old Santa Nick.

1683
02:31:11,010 --> 02:31:12,990
The big man himself.

1684
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:19,630
I'm nice!

1685
02:31:27,650 --> 02:31:29,150
I don't agree.

1686
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:29,230
I don't agree.

1687
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:33,530
What do you mean you don't agree?

1688
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:37,010
Is it because I haunted you?

1689
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:40,190
What did you bribe Santa for this?

1690
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:40,410
No!

1691
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:41,450
I didn't do anything!

1692
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:43,430
I just asked right here, right now.

1693
02:31:44,890 --> 02:31:46,070
You all saw it.

1694
02:31:46,830 --> 02:31:47,770
You all saw it.

1695
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:51,170
Yeah!

1696
02:31:56,750 --> 02:31:57,270
Nice.

1697
02:31:59,150 --> 02:32:02,710
Thank you so much!

1698
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:03,510
Thank you.

1699
02:32:03,730 --> 02:32:04,710
No, not stage.

1700
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:05,390
Not rigged.

1701
02:32:06,090 --> 02:32:06,970
Merry Christmas!

1702
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:10,350
Let's do one last song you guys.

1703
02:32:11,810 --> 02:32:13,310
Maybe one last song.

1704
02:32:14,030 --> 02:32:15,730
And then I'll leave you to guys.

1705
02:32:16,150 --> 02:32:22,790
I'll have sweet Christmas dreams and wake up with many presents under your tree.

1706
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:25,010
What is your wish for...

1707
02:32:28,970 --> 02:32:30,970
I don't know if I should tell you that, Kewpie.

1708
02:32:33,090 --> 02:32:34,670
Santa's being nice to his elves.

1709
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:43,460
People forget that Scarecrow carries a revolver.

1710
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:47,100
If you're still taking requests, evening in December.

1711
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:50,000
Evening in December.

1712
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:51,860
Who's that by?

1713
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:53,820
I don't know if I know that one.

1714
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:01,020
We gotta make the last song a good one.

1715
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:10,690
Oh, I don't even see it on my thing.

1716
02:33:15,610 --> 02:33:17,250
Uncensored version of Mr. Grinch?

1717
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:19,830
There's an uncensored version?

1718
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:24,950
Snake Eater for the ending?

1719
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:29,110
Okay, I'll do two more then.

1720
02:33:29,150 --> 02:33:30,870
Because I see a bunch of people asking for...

1721
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:35,230
I don't know why you guys want me to sing this one so much, but I'll sing it.

1722
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:36,350
Okay, I'll do two more.

1723
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:44,650
In

1724
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:51,490
my mind.

1725
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:52,750
No, I will sing this, don't worry.

1726
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:54,310
Hold on, I'm gonna sing Snake Eater first.

1727
02:33:58,610 --> 02:33:59,450
Sorry for the bait.

1728
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:00,770
Sorry for the bait.

1729
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:01,730
Okay, here we go.

1730
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:51,040
What a thrill I'm searching and I'm melting to you What a fear in my heart But you're so, so free I'd give my life Not for all

1731
02:34:54,330 --> 02:35:25,910
this Snake Eater In my time There'll be no one else Crime, it's the way I fly to you Snake Eater I'm still in a dream Snake Eater

1732
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:54,170
Someday you'll go through the rain Someday you'll feed on a tree frog It's ordeal, the trial to survive For the day we see new light I'd give my life

1733
02:36:03,230 --> 02:36:31,270
But my time There'll be no one else Crime, it's the way I fly to you Snake Eater I'm still in a dream Snake Eater

1734
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:55,560
Oh shit I always do this I always pick the wrong version Thank you so much for the 50 gifts And, oh gosh And Bively, thank you so much for the 50 gifts

1735
02:36:58,590 --> 02:36:59,910
You're pretty good

1736
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:28,790
Snake Eater In my time There'll be...

1737
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:42,780
It just cut off An actual Dimetrodon Thank you!

1738
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,860
Thank you for the hot costume part.

1739
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,140

I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

1744
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:50,200
I want to wish you a minky Christmas.

1745
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:56,680
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1746
02:38:57,880 --> 02:38:59,360
Apple bottom jeans.

1747
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:02,600
And boots with the fur.

1748
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:06,440
Shawnee got the whole club.

1749
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:08,820
Looking at her.

1750
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:13,480
She had the bottom jeans.

1751
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,400
Boots with the fur.

1752
02:39:17,890 --> 02:39:20,090
Got the whole club.

1753
02:39:40,150 --> 02:39:41,830
Wish you a Merry Christmas.

1754
02:39:42,650 --> 02:39:43,010
Thank

1755
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:59,300
you for the karaoke.

1756

I don't see you guys.

1757
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:03,060
Well, I know it's Christmas for some people.

1758
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:07,420
It's really Christmas Eve for me.

1759
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:11,160
But I think it's more fun to celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve.

1760
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:12,840
Minky Christmas.

02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:31,400
I've been watching YouTube since COVID and never really got the whole issue thing.

1772
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:34,020
After watching your streams, clips of you in the community for a while now.

1773
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:35,200
And don't say I didn't help.

02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:35,760
Thank you.

I'm so sorry.

1778
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:42,640
I only said Maximo.
