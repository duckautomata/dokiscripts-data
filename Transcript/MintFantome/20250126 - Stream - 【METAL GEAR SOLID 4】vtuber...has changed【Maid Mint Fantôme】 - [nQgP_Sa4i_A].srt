1
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,560
I've just been watching the sexy ladies in the PMC commercials.

2
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,700
No...

3
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,620
No...

4
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,200
No, hearing this...

5
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,420
Hearing this intro music...

6
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Hearing Old Snake theme...

7
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,380
It kind of kills me.

8
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm already dead, but...

9
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,600
It kills me.

10
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,740
No!

11
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,880
Welcome to Metal Gear Solid 4.

12
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,260
Ah...

13
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,060
The red dot is a nice touch.

14
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,480
I know it's the wrong eye, but it's fine.

15
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,020
It's fine.

16
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,380
Old Snake...

17
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,060
Nate, happy birthday!

18
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,360
Singing a quick happy birthday.

19
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,060
Happy birthday to you.

20
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,200
Happy birthday to you.

21
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,860
Happy birthday, dear Nate.

22
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,460
Happy birthday to you.

23
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Happy birthday!

24
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,770
It is... It is time.

25
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,590
It's Orca Day?

26
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,510
Can Orca get a happy Orca Day?

27
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,190
Is it actually your birthday?

28
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,550
I finally finished MGS4 in preparation for this stream.

29
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,750
Oh my gosh.

30
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,370
It is actually.

31
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,930
Just invert the model?

32
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,850
I thought about that.

33
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,490
I did think about flipping me on the screen.

34
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,130
But it might flip me off.

35
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,870
VTuber has changed.

36
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,570
I'm VTuber who has changed.

37
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,010
Oh, Snake.

38
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,310
Snake, no!

39
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,790
Oh my gosh.

40
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,430
Full disclosure, I have played this game before.

41
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,230
You know, I've played all of Metal Gear series.

42
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,250
Metal Gear Solid series.

43
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,710
But...

44
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,270
Wait, which one are we gonna get now?

45
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
I don't know.

46
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,450
Happy birthday to you.

47
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,850
Happy birthday to you.

48
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,450
Happy birthday dear Orca.

49
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,530
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,850
Oh this one is weird.

51
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,950
This one they are just like dancing in the sky.

52
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,070
Okay.

53
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,490
It's like the most dystopian one I'd say.

54
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,270
From behind she looks like Darth Vader.

55
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,670
Oh, Nier Automata.

56
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,950
Why are they so big?

57
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,890
Oh my god.

58
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,910
What is happening?

59
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,070
I can see some death stranding in this.

60
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,410
I get what you mean.

61
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,770
No peace without war.

62
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,370
The PMC commercials are kind of wack.

63
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,150
Not kind of, they are very wack.

64
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,350
I can't believe Snake has become a hag.

65
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,050
And we'll do summer podcast with Otacon.

66
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,910
My kokoro is not so prepared for this one I think.

67
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,170
I already feel myself so...

68
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,930
But, yeah.

69
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,670
I'm excited to play through it again.

70
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,670
Don't worry Mito, MGS4 gets better with age.

71
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,130
Even those parts.

72
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,430
I love MGS4.

73
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,190
I understand why some people are kind of lukewarm on it.

74
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,790
I think it does have some parts that are just like...

75
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,590
But I love this game.

76
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,990
Those crunchy PS3 graphics.

77
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,990
Yes, I am on my PS3.

78
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,610
I am, I am.

79
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,490
In fact, when I was going to play this, I was like, where is the game?

80
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,630
It's not in the case.

81
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,490
It's actually been in...

82
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,830
It's been in my PS3 since I last played it.

83
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,150
I haven't needed my PS3 since.

84
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,090
It's been in there for like the past two years.

85
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,110
I was somehow gifted a membership despite watching a VOD.

86
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,430
It's spooky, isn't it?

87
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,390
Spooky.

88
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,050
It didn't look like any of the BNB companies.

89
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,490
No, I'm pretty sure it was.

90
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,630
It looked like the mask was like a wolf or something.

91
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,900
So, yeah, my PS3 has just been holding on to the disc.

92
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,720
Until now.

93
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,600
This game is a good starting point to the MGS series.

94
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,300
Shut up!

95
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,920
Don't even joke!

96
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't even joke!

97
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,780
You kept the disc waiting.

98
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,360
Truly.

99
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,540
But I assume that maybe we should be okay for the loading screens.

100
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,500
Probably.

101
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,240
Thank you for the superchat!

102
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,140
This is a PS3 game?

103
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,540
It looks so good for a PS3 game.

104
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Props to Kojima.

105
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,260
Yeah, this is PS3.

106
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Thank you for the superchat.

107
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,380
Can't wait to see your no kill and no alerts run.

108
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,620
Although, I do want to try and get the...

109
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,360
The solar gun.

110
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,780
Tiny people!

111
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
I hate.

112
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
I hate.

113
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,260
I hate.

114
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,880
Why does this look like an ad for a graphics card?

115
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,100
This is my favorite MGS.

116
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,160
I actually checked to see if it was on my shelf of a game store yesterday.

117
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
Oh, on the shelf of a game store yesterday.

118
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,140
It wasn't.

119
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,400
Now you're playing it the next day?

120
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,560
Have you been haunting me?

121
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,340
To be fair, this has been on my schedule all week.

122
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,720
Watching Snake smoking for 15 minutes is part of the experience.

123
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
I know, I love that part too.

124
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
Oh my gosh, you guys!

125
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,480
Speaking of...

126
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,620
I got a package in the mail today of some very important...

127
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,640
Oh no way, I don't think I'll be able to show you.

128
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,760
Okay, I'll just post it to Twitter later.

129
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,560
But I got a package in the mail of some very important Metal Gear things from my collection.

130
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,180
Why not?

131
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,640
Because my second monitor is completely taken over by...

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,580
And if I exit out, it'll be all messed up.

133
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,540
So...

134
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,420
Tumblr...

135
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,460
Did I get those yet?

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,160
Hello, Mint!

137
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
I tried to write something in the chat and I can't see my messages.

138
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,940
Am I blocked?

139
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,940
I don't even remember posting anything in the chat.

140
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,440
I... don't block people.

141
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,240
So...

142
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,040
It's probably YouTube.

143
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,540
I think, yeah, you might be Shadow Band.

144
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,140
My dad played 3 and my first one was MGS4.

145
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,460
No!

146
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,060
Why was your first one before?

147
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,600
No!

148
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,540
Oh my god.

149
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,420
Oh my god, Solidus, welcome to membership.

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,160
Thank you.

151
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Nanomachines.

152
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah, it's the Patriots that are blocking you.

153
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,860
Okay, oh gosh.

155
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,500
I see the Metal Gear stream.

156
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,720
I can finally let my brain rot be free.

157
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,400
I kind of get like overloaded on brain rot.

158
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,080
Like, I need a place to dump my thoughts and my feelings, you know?

159
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,780
And I don't.

160
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,360
Am I getting the updated version of Snake's Figma?

161
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course I am.

162
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,120
So, okay.

163
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,880
Alright.

164
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,960
Are we ready to get started?

165
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,040
If someone tells you that they became a VTuber because you inspired them to become one, would that make you feel proud?

166
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,160
I mean, I would be honored about that, yeah.

167
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,320
Okay, one last, one last, one last, one last commercial.

168
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,800
Sorry, my first Metal Gear was 5.

169
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,740
This is what I'm gonna do to you!

170
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,040
This is what I'll do to you if your first Metal Gear is 5!

171
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,840
No!

172
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,840
No!

173
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,700
Never a shot in the dark.

174
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,020
Damn.

175
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,420
That one didn't even show up.

176
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,420
You need to rehire.

177
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,500
If it isn't Saucy Minto, please watch out that you won't...

178
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,760
That you don't become saucier, otherwise you will start dripping mint sauce from you.

179
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,540
Eww, eww.

180
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,100
Okay.

181
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,860
Could be worse, it could have been survive.

182
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,520
I got, I got... Okay, so in the mail I got a couple of Metal Gear things today.

183
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,640
One of them I accidentally forgot... Oh yeah, someone mentioned the tumblers.

184
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,600
I have not received those yet.

185
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
The ones that I won from...

186
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,380
From Toreba, I haven't gotten those yet.

187
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,750
I wonder how long shipping usually takes.

188
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,480
Ah, it's been forever!

189
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
If I load game from my old game...

190
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,100
Do I get the like... There's no new game plus stuff, is there?

191
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,420
So sad.

192
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,180
I don't think I played... I didn't do like any special ranking.

193
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,520
And I'm not trying for any special ranking this time either.

194
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,420
Because I just like to enjoy the game, honestly.

195
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,560
I just like to take my time.

196
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,520
There is new game plus?

197
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,300
There is?

198
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,920
Okay.

199
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,680
Can I earn trophies?

200
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,380
You must start playing from new game.

201
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,940
Oh well.

202
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,900
Okay.

203
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,780
I forgot what I was saying.

204
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,520
I've been saying multiple things and then remembering other things.

205
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,540
My brain is a little slow today.

206
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,640
Sorry, I'm kind of sleepy.

207
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
The boss extreme.

208
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,020
No!

209
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,040
No!

210
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,220
Sunlight.

211
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah, I want to get the solar gun.

212
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,040
I think you have to...

213
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,860
I know for sure I played non-lethal with the bosses.

214
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,740
Like the boss babes.

215
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,700
The beauty boss babe.

216
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,000
I can't remember the beauty and the beasts.

217
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,480
I can't remember what they're called.

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,060
I just keep calling them boss babes.

219
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,360
The beauty and the beast.

220
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,040
But then I think you also have to be non-lethal with the PMCs.

221
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,520
And then also in the first...

222
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,240
The first two acts?

223
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,720
Or is it the second act?

224
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,360
I can't remember.

225
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,080
I looked it up.

226
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,620
And then you get all their little trophies.

227
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,040
And then you...

228
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,200
Get...

229
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,780
You get their statues and then you can get the solar gun.

230
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,700
It's kind of confusing.

231
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm sorry, Arthur.

232
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,300
I really don't know.

233
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,380
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,800
If you were...

235
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,300
If you were blocked...

236
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,280
I can't really check right now.

237
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,380
But...

238
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,480
I really... It probably was an accident.

239
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,530
If it happened, but I...

240
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,460
Usually if someone gets timed out, they're timed out.

241
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,740
But I don't usually block from chat unless it's like a spammer.

242
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,430
But lots of people get shadow banned very often on YouTube, so...

243
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,240
Yeah, people in chat have experienced it too, so...

244
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,720
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,280
Is PS3 the only way to play MGS4 nowadays?

246
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,540
Officially, yes.

247
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,320
There is like a...

248
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,800
What is it?

249
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,540
Like a 60fps version on PC that you can technically play, but...

250
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,860
But as of like an official way, yeah, it's kind of... Yeah, you can emulate it.

251
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,640
Yeah, but it's not as good.

252
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,560
Actually, didn't they fix it?

253
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,220
Or is it still not so good?

254
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,300
I don't remember.

255
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,640
I heard it's buggy.

256
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,080
I can't remember if they recently fixed it though.

257
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,760
I feel like I remember hearing it...

258
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,700
It was really, really bad and then I remember hearing that it maybe is a little more stable now.

259
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,740
But I have my PS3 so I can...

260
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,860
So I can play it.

261
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,100
Sorry, that scared the hell out of me.

262
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,810
Oh my God!

263
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,310
David Hader!

264
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,990
Accomplished actor, screenwriter, voice of a generation.

265
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,510
A citizen of the world.

266
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,270
Ripped from a comfortable childhood in Canada.

267
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,690
Thrown into the turbulent waters of Adelaide.

268
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,690
Also, the other voice actress.

269
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,250
A bit of a spoiler for later in the game.

270
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,520
Well, my dad got transferred overseas and...

271
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,240
He's Canadian?

272
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
He is!

273
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,120
I love hearing David Hader's Japanese.

274
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,580
Biggest secret...

275
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,760
Oh my God, we're going to hear it right here.

276
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
But he...

277
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,040
We'll never know!

278
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,120
After the baby I ballooned?

279
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,680
I thought she said after I was a baby.

280
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,500
My own baby.

281
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,060
My own baby.

282
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,240
My own baby.

283
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,080
Baby.

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Husband, baby.

285
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,180
Baby, baby, baby.

286
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,420
Husband, baby, baby.

287
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,020
Oh, those look like boobs.

288
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,040
Baby, baby, baby.

289
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,460
Shideo1.

290
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,920
Bogie here, welcome back to 2014.

291
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,120
Oh, it's 2014!

292
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,320
Shideo2.

293
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,580
Oh.

294
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,860
Oh my God, we love Susan.

295
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,880
Can we get the boom mic closer to her please?

296
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh, I hate this one.

297
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:56,980
I forgot.

298
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,920
Thanks for the...

299
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,860
Oh, thanks for the raid!

300
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,800
Hello, hello.

301
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,660
We're just now starting MGS4.

302
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,020
Oh, we watched this one earlier.

303
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,200
Wait, is this the sexy one?

304
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
Yeah, baby!

305
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,680
Superficier.

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,940
Say thank you to the sanguifers.

307
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,180
Snake was James Bond.

308
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Would you want to be James Bone?

309
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,020
James Bone?

310
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,160
Oh yeah.

311
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh yeah.

312
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,500
Oh, we watched this one too?

313
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,060
We saw this one too?

314
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,820
Oh, the praying man.

315
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Goodbye.

316
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,060
Aw man.

317
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,920
Thank you for all the gifts.

318
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

319
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,360
James Bond.

320
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,980
The not too distant future on a tired battlefield.

321
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,000
War has become routine.

322
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,220
Aw man.

323
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,210
I hate this font.

324
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,370
I still hate this font.

325
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,930
Oh, it's so terrible.

326
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,840
Aw, so many familiar names.

327
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,160
Such a good intro.

328
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,480
Aw man.

329
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,840
He'll say it.

330
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,160
He's old.

331
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,020
Give him a minute.

332
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,120
Catch his breath.

333
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,780
Give him a minute to catch his breath.

334
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,980
Shhh.

335
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,420
He said the thing.

336
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,880
Sorry, it's like a meme.

337
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,500
Genetic control.

338
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,120
Information control.

339
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,070
Don't say poop control.

340
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,310
No.

341
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:36,850
No.

342
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,990
Oh gosh, this opening sequence is so stressful.

343
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,910
I hate the geckos.

344
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,310
War has changed.

345
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,990
When the battlefield is under total control, war becomes routine.

346
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,480
Ooh, it's incoming.

347
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,460
I hate those trauma sounds.

348
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,880
Who let this old man on the field?

349
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,840
Who let this guy fight?

350
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,520
He should be retired.

351
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh my god.

352
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,880
Game kinda loud.

353
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah, I'm adjusting it as it goes.

354
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,550
It's hard because sometimes the voice is so low and the fighting sounds so loud.

355
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,510
But also I want you to be able to hear it.

356
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,770
Oh god.

357
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,110
Why did you break?

358
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,350
Kill that guy right there.

359
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,870
He's literally just pointing at me.

360
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,110
Oh yeah, shoot him.

361
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,950
I love auto-aim.

362
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,130
Let's see, we got a stun knife.

363
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,650
Now we got a ration.

364
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,050
Meal ready to eat, baby.

365
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,090
I forgot about the psyche.

366
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,730
I forgot about our stress level.

367
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,310
It's too dangerous to stay in one spot.

368
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,870
Get wrecked, then get out of there as soon as possible.

369
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,430
Ooh, Otacon!

370
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,490
I'm trying to remember how to control again.

371
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,150
Yeah.

372
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,130
Thanks Otacon.

373
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,510
Crouch walk is...Oh crouch walk!

374
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,230
Yes!

375
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,710
Yeah, crouch walk baby!

376
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,270
I am.

377
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,690
I gotta wiggle my way over there, OK?

378
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,610
Otacon's backseating!

379
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,990
Oh god, here it comes.

380
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,350
Oh no.

381
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,390
Hyōjishinkawa!

382
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:08,930
Yeah!

383
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,280
Do the super slow crawl.

384
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,220
You guys are sickos!

385
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,080
You guys are sickos!

386
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,100
Gotta keep the cigarette in the mouth.

387
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,540
You know what?

388
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,180
According to Peace Walker, we have vaping.

389
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,240
But Snake doesn't choose to use it and I really appreciate that honestly.

390
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,920
Just keep moving.

391
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,100
OK, hold on.

392
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,320
Here you guys go!

393
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
Exactly what you wanted!

394
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,500
Are you happy?

395
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,160
Oh, I just stepped over that guy.

396
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,080
You got anything for me to take?

397
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,880
Oh, actually yeah.

398
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,440
This is the gameplay I subscribe for.

399
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,340
Exactly.

400
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,120
I give the people what they want.

401
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,640
Vote for me though.

402
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,320
Vote for slow...for ground humping Snake.

403
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,670
It ain't gonna be me.

404
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,890
I'm not the backup here.

405
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,610
Why do you guys have such shitty aim?

406
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,650
Just be better.

407
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,470
What was that sound?

408
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,150
Welcome to membership!

409
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,030
Thank you!

410
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,050
Two steps and then a cutscene.

411
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,170
I know I love this game!

412
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,210
You got my vote.

413
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,750
I hear it.

414
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,540
Do you guys hear it?

415
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,780
Oh no!

416
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
It might be loud.

417
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,580
Incoming loud.

418
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,400
Would there be so many...

419
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,000
crickets and cicada noises if you're in like the desert?

420
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,620
I hate these guys.

421
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,500
They're fun in...they're fun in Revengeance because I can slice and dice them.

422
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,540
I love the crunchy FPS.

423
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,760
Do I have a gun?

424
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,980
I don't have anything.

425
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm just gonna leave.

426
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,840
I'm gonna get out of here.

427
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,060
I can't see the door.

428
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,960
Oh shoot.

429
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't worry about me.

430
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,440
Don't worry about me.

431
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,330
I literally have trapped myself.

432
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,930
You don't see me.

433
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,110
Actually I can't tell if he sees me.

434
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:47,870
Oh good.

435
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,250
He's killing other people.

436
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,030
We can go.

437
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,310
North!

438
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,910
North!

439
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,110
Which way is north?

440
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,710
Which way is north?

441
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,710
I'm going the wrong way.

442
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,350
Ok, we're fine.

443
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,310
Hello.

444
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,690
Oh, you're not my enemy.

445
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,290
Nevermind.

446
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,230
North is...I have a literal compass and I'm still lost.

447
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,150
Don't mind me.

448
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,700
Don't mind me.

449
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,620
Ok, you know what?

450
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,560
I can't read...I can't read compasses clearly.

451
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,340
Everyone?

452
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,480
Everyone?

453
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
This guy over here is just screaming.

454
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,020
Oh no!

455
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,200
Oh no!

456
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,680
I think it's this way.

457
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,500
I can't...yeah, it's over here.

458
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,320
I was like, I know I'm going the right way.

459
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,890
I was like, I know it's over here, but I went to the wall instead.

460
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,990
That's why I got lost.

461
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,030
That's no good.

462
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,590
Oh, that's no good.

463
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,510
Oh, that's no good.

464
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,270
Old Snake is like, I have fought helicopters.

465
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,190
You are no match for me.

466
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,310
His feet are kicking in the air.

467
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,950
He's so pathetic.

468
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh my god, he's gonna do it.

469
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,940
Old man...

470
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,200
Look up.

471
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,050
Oh my god, I have a figure of that pose.

472
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,720
These things are too good.

473
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,520
You're gonna choke on that thing, Snake.

474
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,790
Big boy.

475
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,370
I love that they're modeled after Rex.

476
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,110
They're so cute.

477
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,940
Oh my god, ye old faithful.

478
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,000
Ye old faithful, get in there.

479
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,760
My god, the feet are insane.

480
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,370
So awesome.

481
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,210
I love the camo in this game, baby.

482
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,710
No place to hide.

483
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,150
Oh my god, it's scanning my DNA.

484
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,130
Pick it up, Snake.

485
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,230
Ok, now we know this is extremely inaccurate.

486
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,590
We know this is extremely inaccurate because...

487
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,430
Because the AI was fooled by the box.

488
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,350
Not the watermelon, it's still good to eat.

489
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,340
No place for Hideo.

490
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,400
He just smashed, he just cooked it for us.

491
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,720
Or cut it for us.

492
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,400
He cooked us a good watermelon.

493
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,260
What's wrong with my brain?

494
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,360
Again.

495
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,850
Old Snake again.

496
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,570
This game is so depressing.

497
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,850
Metal Gear Solid 5!

498
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,390
Clappies.

499
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,470
Everybody clap.

500
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,770
I see something and I clap.

501
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:47,870
No.

502
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,910
Save that for later.

503
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,690
People wonder why Kojima made so many stealth games.

504
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,810
His name is literally Hide-o.

505
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,770
Hideo.

506
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,600
Cinema!

507
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,780
Cinema!

508
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,060
Ok.

509
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,520
Ok, baby.

510
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,100
God, this suit is so sexy.

511
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,480
Konami.

512
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,710
Nusef.

513
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,230
The cheeks.

514
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,350
I know!

515
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,190
My goodness gracious.

516
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,530
He may be old, but them cheeks still clapping.

517
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,130
True.

518
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,730
I don't know why...

519
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,010
Well, I don't want to say any spoilers.

520
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,430
I'm not going to say any spoilers.

521
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,110
Sorry, I almost got ahead of myself about someone crying.

522
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,290
No spoilers!

523
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:16,870
Sorry.

524
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:23,350
I didn't want to say that though, just because, you know, there are probably some people watching that don't know MGS4.

525
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,010
So let's...

526
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,210
Oh!

527
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,170
Let's keep the spoilers to a minimum.

528
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,810
Baby!

529
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,650
Baby!

530
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,510
No!

531
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,610
I know, what the hell.

532
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,030
Build the 1-100 model.

533
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,230
Rex, good luck!

534
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,870
Chat is going to dunk on you so hard if you miss any of those splash back things.

535
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,590
I'm used to chat dunking on me.

536
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:51,970
Your early aging symptoms look like classic Fairness Syndrome, but none of the tests were able to pinpoint the cause.

537
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,390
Judging by how rapidly the aging has progressed, I'd say...

538
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,810
Cringe disease.

539
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,370
No!

540
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,330
Snake, let's try another doctor.

541
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:23,990
Yeah.

542
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,740
Oh, I missed it.

543
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,140
Sorry, my vision was blurred with tears, OK?

544
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,060
Well, you would have just seen flashbacks of MGS1.

545
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,080
Oh, here we go.

546
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,840
Oh god.

547
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,320
The one time I do click it, I have to see her stupid ass face.

548
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,660
Go away, Naomi!

549
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,500
They are like, do you remember Naomi?

550
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,740
Colonel.

551
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,640
That's just a suit.

552
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,180
Do you remember Naomi?

553
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,220
I try not to.

554
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,540
Yeah, that is kind of foreshadowing, huh?

555
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,590
Use your words, Snake.

556
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,550
Use your words.

557
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,820
It's rapid aging, but rapid...

558
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,570
Rapid cavemanning too.

559
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,110
Oh, remember that guy?

560
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,350
Remember that guy?

561
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,850
Why did they only show Liquid from MGS1?

562
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,990
Brother.

563
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,750
He's got to go fight his brother.

564
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,690
He's gonna go fight his brother.

565
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,190
I know people make fun of the cutscenes in this game, how it's literally a quote-unquote interactive movie.

566
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,730
But I honestly prefer it to be just a cutscene.

567
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,130
OK.

568
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,370
OK.

569
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,590
Hear me out.

570
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,170
Hear me out, OK?

571
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,390
Hear me out a little bit.

572
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:20,050
I find that it's more offensive when a game pretends like it's gameplay for me to walk around and then view something as if it's a cutscene.

573
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,230
Rather than just having a cutscene.

574
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,510
Like, if they're just like, oh, you...

575
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,830
Like, I feel like they're making fun of me.

576
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:35,690
If they're like, oh, but it's gameplay if you get to do this and that while it's actually like a cutscene.

577
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:42,490
Like, say we were doing that cutscene and like Snake walked around and could like sit and crouch or whatever at the grave.

578
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,670
You know, things like that.

579
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,010
F to pay respects.

580
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,190
That's what I'm saying.

581
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,390
Like you have to do like a press X to shake Otacon's hand or something like that.

582
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,810
I feel like that is more offensive to me than just...

583
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,350
Because it's such a lazy way of gameplay.

584
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,950
Just have the damn cutscene.

585
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,630
Like, yeah, follow Otacon.

586
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,130
Yeah!

587
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,710
So, I know people are just like, this is my favorite interactive movie.

588
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:16,510
But, at least I don't feel like I'm being treated like a baby.

589
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,070
Okay, let's continue.

590
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,930
My very serious take.

591
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,990
Sorry, I'm so excited.

592
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,050
9, 2, 5, 9, 0, 3, 6, 0.

593
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,540
0, 5, 4, 8, 8, 2, 4, 6, 6, 5, 2.

594
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,520
Also, Speedy Fire, I will sing you happy birthday.

595
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,620
After, whenever the next cutscene ends.

596
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,960
Act 1!

597
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,800
Liquid Sun.

598
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,480
Humming.

599
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,130
Okidoki.

600
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,350
Praying Mantis.

601
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,550
Hello?

602
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,050
Lizards.

603
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,870
Yeah,

604
00:45:59,730 --> 00:45:59,970
I know.

605
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,690
They're crazy.

606
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,750
Hmm.

607
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:18,490
Fans.

608
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,370
Yeah.

609
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,890
Mark 2.

610
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:28,830
Okay.

611
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,790
Sunny!

612
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,070
Okay.

613
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,790
Got it.

614
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,330
Okay.

615
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,490
Look at his little smile.

616
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,690
I also hate how the codec looks in this game.

617
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,250
Okidoki.

618
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,370
Okay, I have a birthday song to sing to you.

619
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,990
Can I get a happy birthday from your boss?

620
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,890
Of course!

621
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,310
Happy birthday to you.

622
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,170
Happy birthday to you.

623
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,170
Happy birthday, Speedy Fire.

624
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,610
Happy birthday to you.

625
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,750
Happy birthday!

626
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,390
Are we going to watch the mission briefing?

627
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,210
Is there one in this?

628
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,210
I actually don't remember.

629
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,070
Where is Gas Snake or Plasma Snake?

630
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,730
In your heart.

631
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,550
And GS4 is a love letter to the fans.

632
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,190
It's a classic.

633
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:35,910
Yeah, I know.

634
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:36,970
I love it.

635
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,170
Main menu briefing.

636
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:39,730
Oh, I did skip it then.

637
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:40,370
My bad.

638
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,370
It's okay though.

639
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,890
I feel like...

640
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Don't they go over the briefing though?

641
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,740
I don't remember.

642
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,300
I thought that it was also a cutscene in the game.

643
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,460
I don't remember.

644
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,040
I don't remember.

645
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,200
It's my first time seeing this game.

646
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,820
All my experience with MGS has been through your streams.

647
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,380
I'll be honest, this wasn't what I expected from the E3 trailer we watched.

648
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,560
Yes, it's quite different, right?

649
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,760
And now we have Octocamo, baby!

650
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,380
Can you make Old Man Snake do the worm?

651
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,400
I already did it.

652
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,080
I'm not going to make him do it all the time.

653
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,940
Okay, hold on.

654
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,840
L1, fire with R1.

655
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,220
Okay.

656
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,980
R1, fire.

657
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,960
Open the window.

658
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,680
Switch between semi and full auto.

659
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,280
Okay.

660
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,300
Okey dokey.

661
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,180
We're going to go...

662
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,220
This way?

663
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,620
Wait.

664
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,800
Oh gosh.

665
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,800
Okay, reading the map.

666
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,120
Ew, stinky.

667
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,440
Oh, I got some ammo.

668
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,200
Okay, we got to go around though, I think.

669
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,060
Is this going to keep auto-aim on?

670
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,200
I didn't turn it on.

671
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,200
It was on automatically.

672
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,180
I don't even remember how to turn it off, so...

673
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,480
Oh, hey guys.

674
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,240
Just don't... Just ignore me.

675
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,960
Just ignore me.

676
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,480
Oh, okay.

677
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,120
They will ignore me.

678
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,820
Oh, I hope the tank also ignores me.

679
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,650
Do you think it's select?

680
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:38,630
I don't know.

681
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,250
They are ignoring me.

682
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,570
Oh, hello guys.

683
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,110
Holy moly.

684
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,770
Oh, okay.

685
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,190
Here we go.

686
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,870
Got it!

687
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,050
Who the hell saw me?

688
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,470
Are you kidding me right now?

689
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,250
I'm running.

690
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,090
Bye!

691
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,030
Bye!

692
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,870
I'm going!

693
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,190
Yeah, I'm going!

694
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,040
I forgot how dramatic the...

695
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,240
The death scene is so funny.

696
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,560
Oh my gosh.

697
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,060
Who saw me?

698
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,900
I think it was these guys.

699
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,260
Where are they?

700
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,040
Actually, where did they go?

701
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,000
Who's over here?

702
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,760
Oh, I can't go this way.

703
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,060
Okay.

704
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,260
Let's see.

705
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,500
Avoid that area.

706
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,200
Otacon, this is literally where you put the Mark 2.

707
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,940
So honestly, it's your fault that I have to go over there.

708
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,680
You're the one trying to kill me, buddy.

709
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,900
Okay.

710
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
Octocam, baby.

711
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,080
Worm crawl.

712
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,440
I'm crawling, okay?

713
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,980
It's honestly Otacon's fault.

714
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,640
So, we can blame him for all of our mistakes.

715
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,440
We're at 80% camo.

716
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,960
85%, let's go.

717
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,140
And now, not a lot.

718
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,660
80%.

719
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,200
85%.

720
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,020
Oh, what's in here?

721
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,810
Oh, are you my friend?

722
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,110
Friend or foe?

723
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:43,730
I can't remember.

724
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,390
Are you friend?

725
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:51,550
Anyway.

726
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,150
Oh my God!

727
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:00,930
Oh

728
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,530
my God!

729
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:05,990
He's dead!

730
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:06,590
He's dead!

731
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:07,090
Nevermind.

732
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:07,730
Shoot him again.

733
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,750
Oh, just kidding.

734
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:09,310
He's dead.

735
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,070
Ice cream!

736
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,640
It freaked me out.

737
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,200
Wait, hold on.

738
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,060
I have to remember how to punch and stuff.

739
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,160
Oh, that's auto-aim.

740
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,480
Okay.

741
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,040
Punch.

742
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,640
Punch.

743
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,280
Punch?

744
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,500
How do I punch?

745
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,780
Punch?

746
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,000
I can't punch?

747
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,840
Okay, weird.

748
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,020
Is it R1?

749
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,440
Oh.

750
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,000
Sorry, it's been a long while since I've...

751
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,840
Okay, cool.

752
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,760
It's been a minute since I... And let's equip instead our stun knife.

753
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,100
Let's see.

754
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,100
Ready the knife with L1.

755
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,540
Use with R1 to strike!

756
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,760
And R2 to shock attack.

757
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,180
Cool.

758
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,940
Alright, punch.

759
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,100
Punch, baby!

760
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,240
Alright.

761
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,860
That guy...

762
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,760
Went in there, so I'm gonna go...

763
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,240
I'm gonna go this way.

764
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,380
Holy moly, he's like right there.

765
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
Yeah, you can leave.

766
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,660
Where the hell is the Mark II?

767
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,200
Why'd you put it so far away, Otacon?

768
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,040
Oh my god.

769
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,720
No way.

770
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:35,820
Nothing?

771
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,520
No one?

772
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,680
Nothing?

773
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,780
Please don't see me.

774
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,140
We're camoing?

775
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,040
We're camoing?

776
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,740
Camo?

777
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,000
Is it this way?

778
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,460
I thought I saw somebody.

779
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,260
We're going?

780
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,320
We're sneaking?

781
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,760
We're being real sneaky?

782
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:00,980
Worm.

783
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,280
Okay, you guys wanna see the worm?

784
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,860
Here you go.

785
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,900
You call this nothing?

786
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,660
What's wrong with you?

787
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,260
I remember this.

788
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,480
Old Snake has camo-toe.

789
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,180
Don't call it that, please!

790
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,560
Wait, is he... He's got a wedgie for sure.

791
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,640
We can say that at the least.

792
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,840
Wait.

793
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:43,530
No, no.

794
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:43,910
Get up.

795
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:44,730
Get up, Snake.

796
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,870
How do I get up here?

797
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:46,710
I can't remember.

798
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,030
No, Snake.

799
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:58,830
No, Snake.

800
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,250
Come on!

801
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,090
Hold forward and triangle.

802
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:07,230
Oh, there it is.

803
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,610
It was only letting me...

804
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,910
Why would you grab there?

805
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,110
Snake!

806
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,570
Why?

807
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,150
What?

808
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:37,670
That's what I'll do to you if you play MGS5 first.

809
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,540
We're so sneaky.

810
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,140
Super sneaky.

811
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,300
We're so sneaky.

812
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,000
Super sneaky.

813
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't know if anybody's in here.

814
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,760
Actually, is there anything in here for us to grab?

815
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,570
A moose?

816
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:06,930
What?

817
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:08,990
Oh, what's this?

818
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,150
We got a regain?

819
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:12,930
You don't need that.

820
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,170
You have a fresh set of hair, Snake.

821
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,010
You don't need that at all.

822
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,350
What's over here?

823
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,310
I'm just exploring a bit now.

824
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,170
I played MGS5 first.

825
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,430
Is that a Russian?

826
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:33,130
Yup.

827
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:42,430
This is definitely one of the games that I... Well, I can honestly say I only played it once because...

828
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,550
It's quite a long...

829
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,750
Oh, hell no.

830
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:57,030
No!

831
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,260
What was I gonna say?

832
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,660
It's a longer game, but I've watched the cutscenes because the cutscenes are so good.

833
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,140
OK, let's just wait.

834
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,620
Our stress is going up.

835
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,780
He's not gonna look in here, right?

836
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,100
You'll see all the other lockers open and only this one shut.

837
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,120
Yeah, don't look in the only closed locker, buddy.

838
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,980
I think we're fine.

839
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,660
Damn, I didn't see that guy at all.

840
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,100
OK, don't go up there.

841
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,400
I hear him stepping.

842
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,520
Oh my god, don't do it.

843
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,900
Don't you dare.

844
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,160
Don't you dare.

845
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,100
I hate you so...

846
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,280
I stabbed him!

847
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,380
I'm old, please!

848
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,220
Oh my god, I'm just...

849
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,700
Stab!

850
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:04,980
Stab!

851
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,060
Why can't I stab them?

852
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,460
Oh my god, not the reinforcement.

853
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,340
OK, I think it's time for a gun.

854
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,060
Oh.

855
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,320
Don't go up the stairs.

856
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,100
What a bastard.

857
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,160
That guy is seeing me and then opening the locker.

858
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,600
I hate this AI.

859
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,480
It's my karma for ripping off that guy's peepee, isn't it?

860
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,160
I'm sorry.

861
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,440
I'm sorry!

862
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,590
Advanced AI.

863
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,010
Too advanced for me.

864
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,610
Wait, is it not here anymore?

865
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:55,830
Oh, OK.

866
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,650
OK, quiet steps, Snake.

867
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,530
Quiet steps.

868
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,010
Okey dokey.

869
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,870
I tried... OK.

870
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,530
Ready the knife with L1 and then I kept pressing R2?

871
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,190
Maybe I have to... I don't know.

872
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,530
Does it have to be stuck in their body for the electric shock attack?

873
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,270
Or I think they just kept hitting me and I... you know.

874
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,700
This guy, does he turn around?

875
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,600
Don't you do it.

876
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,520
Don't you turn...

877
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,400
Very...

878
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,880
Very inconspicuous, Snake.

879
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,680
We love that.

880
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,000
Dumbass.

881
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:03,870
Oh gosh.

882
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,090
I wonder if I can go up and CQC him.

883
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,070
How do I do the codec in this?

884
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:10,690
Here we go.

885
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,770
Otacon, can I attack this guy?

886
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,110
Yeah, and you put it so far away.

887
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,350
Attempt it?

888
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,050
OK, we can attempt it.

889
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:28,750
You know what?

890
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:29,930
Let's attempt it, because what?

891
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,090
He's all by him lonesome?

892
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,650
It looks like it's like... he's there.

893
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,810
If I dot...

894
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:38,950
Oh my God.

895
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:41,190
Nobody.

896
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,130
Nobody.

897
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,190
Oh my God.

898
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,830
We need to turn around now!

899
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,170
You stood there for like ten fucking minutes!

900
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,930
As soon as I start going...

901
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,410
You think he'll... Oh, I'm gonna run.

902
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,030
Nope, nobody here.

903
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,090
Exactly.

904
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,010
Isn't that great?

905
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,610
Where am I?

906
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,190
Where am I?

907
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,570
Can you... There we go.

908
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:16,730
Alright, nice.

909
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,690
I hear steps.

910
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,950
Get down, snake.

911
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,430
Snake, get down, down.

912
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,510
Like, get down on the ground, ground.

913
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,130
OK, are they gonna see me?

914
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,150
I'm at 85%.

915
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,850
I might be OK.

916
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:31,290
No.

917
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,730
I can't...

918
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,590
Don't go this way.

919
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:38,930
Please.

920
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:39,930
Yep, there you go.

921
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,830
Oh my God!

922
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,150
Holy... Thank God I was against the wall.

923
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,210
Is it in here?

924
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,330
There we go.

925
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,450
I thought so.

926
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,170
Edward, happy birthday!

927
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,470
Happy birthday to you.

928
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,510
Happy birthday to you.

929
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,590
Happy birthday to you, Edward.

930
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,590
Happy birthday to you.

931
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,530
Happy birthday!

932
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:13,150
Gosh, I heard their steps though.

933
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,030
That's why I didn't go.

934
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:14,910
Thank goodness.

935
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,310
Little Mark 2, you are so goofy looking.

936
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,050
It's me, snake.

937
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,410
Metal Gear?

938
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,650
Except he's got smooth moves.

939
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,190
Do you remember Rex?

940
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,470
And look how goofy and cute it is.

941
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,570
It's just like those dogs.

942
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:01,630
OK

943
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:15,710
Goodies What's that?

944
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:22,010
We got the solid eye baby!

945
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,110
You can't see but mine says Mito Eye System.

946
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,870
Jump!

947
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,210
Why did you have to make it the left eye though?

948
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,970
Why did you have to become Solidus?

949
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:48,290
Yeah!

950
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,310
Those are our allies.

951
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,010
Well, they will be.

952
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:53,890
Right?

953
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:59,330
I have to make friends.

954
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,990
Left eye dominant maybe?

955
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,730
You shoot out of your right eye typically.

956
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,150
Yeah, but he can still see through it.

957
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,210
Otacon, I love you.

958
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,510
You are so good to me.

959
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:32,470
Yeah

960
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,110
It's a little...

961
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:39,830
Yeah

962
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:53,110
The fact that Otacon is moving this and making it so moe...

963
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,330
I want him to be a Vtuber.

964
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:58,250
OK

965
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:14,150
OK OK Literally

966
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,870
I'm on my toes and my heels.

967
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,990
Alright!

968
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,770
We got the Mark 2 Pistol.

969
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,490
We got the Operator.

970
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,070
We got the Solid Eye.

971
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,210
Blue text represents an ally.

972
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,750
Closer color to red represents a hostile target.

973
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:40,850
OK!

974
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:42,890
Metal Gear Mark 2!

975
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,250
Equip it from the item window.

976
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,870
Yeah, we can like kind of just send him out and have him scope things for us.

977
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,830
A schlep?

978
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,990
A schlep?

979
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,950
OK That way?

980
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,450
That way.

981
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:02,610
OK.

982
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:03,210
Hold on.

983
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,210
I'm gonna send out... Here I wanna show you guys.

984
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,430
Let's try him out.

985
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,790
Sir, I release you!

986
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:09,650
No.

987
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,330
Wait.

988
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:10,550
Yeah.

989
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,530
Release you!

990
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:13,530
Mark 2!

991
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,550
It's got a lot of other functions as well.

992
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,410
Here we go!

993
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,470
Oh god!

994
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,510
Oh god!

995
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,730
Mark 2, get out of there!

996
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,570
He's gone forever.

997
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,950
Mark 2!

998
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,110
No, he's fine.

999
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,190
We got him still.

1000
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,870
We got our Solid Eye.

1001
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:12,850
He wants us to go this way cause Otacon hates us a bit.

1002
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:18,630
Let's do... I can't remember if it's this Act 1 or Act 2.

1003
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:23,570
I think it's Act 2 where we need to go completely non-lethal, but...

1004
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,330
I'll do it here anyway just in case.

1005
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,190
Rip the Mark 2.

1006
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,270
No!

1007
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:37,130
And we can get more Octocamo if we do that.

1008
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,930
Who's our buddies?

1009
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,110
Assault Rifle.

1010
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,290
Oh shoot!

1011
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,570
How do I... There we go.

1012
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:49,930
Hello?

1013
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,270
Can I move?

1014
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,790
Can I... Oh I have to... Oh my god.

1015
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,630
My hand.

1016
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,510
I took that guy out.

1017
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,350
I'll take him out too.

1018
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,640
Oh my god.

1019
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,060
It's like so many... Oh!

1020
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,240
It's so many things that I have to push to like...

1021
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,220
How do you hear that?

1022
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,840
How do you even hear that?

1023
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,700
You don't.

1024
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,880
Like don't even pretend that you hear that.

1025
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,740
Oh it's locked on.

1026
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,760
How do I stop that?

1027
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,340
Oh my god.

1028
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:32,640
Sorry.

1029
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,720
I'm still... OK.

1030
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,080
Basically, so you have... Why am I... OK there we go.

1031
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,600
You have to press triangle.

1032
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,420
Why am I like a dog?

1033
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,740
Snake what are you doing?

1034
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,120
Get a snake!

1035
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,220
Guys, I don't know how I did this.

1036
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:49,740
Oh there we go.

1037
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,180
OK.

1038
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,760
Apparently when you're lying down and you press...

1039
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,800
Those are allies?

1040
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,460
I can't tell.

1041
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,020
Oh my god.

1042
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,160
It's such craziness here.

1043
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:06,700
OK.

1044
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,140
Lock on.

1045
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,260
Ass.

1046
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,000
I'll get these guys too.

1047
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,180
Why not?

1048
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,800
That guy has a helmet on.

1049
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,480
But I think I still got him.

1050
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,360
These guys are the allies-ish.

1051
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,140
I think I have to earn their trust first.

1052
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,800
But let's just...

1053
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,800
I'm helping you guys out.

1054
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,340
Where are they shooting from anyway?

1055
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,720
There's just bullets everywhere.

1056
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,540
Shoot this way snake.

1057
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,180
Do that.

1058
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:40,900
Shoot that guy.

1059
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,600
Now I can't see him.

1060
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:43,720
Just kidding.

1061
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,780
Shoot these guys.

1062
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,420
Shoot that guy.

1063
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,920
Shoot... Oh that's not a guy.

1064
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,240
Oh now it's on fire!

1065
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:50,920
OK get that guy.

1066
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:51,880
OK I'm gonna keep going.

1067
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,200
Anyway good luck everybody else.

1068
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,470
Collect all their weapons and I can...

1069
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,310
Yeah I got your back buddy!

1070
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,910
I got your back buddy!

1071
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,470
I got your back...buddy!

1072
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,680
You got my back?

1073
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,520
I got your back.

1074
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,480
And then I left.

1075
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,320
How do I do that?

1076
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,740
Open the item.

1077
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,660
Oh there we go.

1078
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:50,640
Night vision.

1079
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,660
Suddenly it's... Oh my god.

1080
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,180
This isn't buddy though.

1081
01:10:59,320 --> 01:10:59,820
This is buddy.

1082
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,420
This is buddy.

1083
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,820
Right?

1084
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,500
It's buddy.

1085
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,520
This is buddy.

1086
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,920
I can't see anything.

1087
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,680
What is... Oh binoculars.

1088
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,740
This is buddy.

1089
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,980
I think they're buddy.

1090
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,940
Gosh he's coming.

1091
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,760
I'm buddy!

1092
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,640
I'm buddy.

1093
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:34,100
OK I'm buddy.

1094
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,540
I'm buddy.

1095
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,020
I'm buddy.

1096
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,120
See it's blue.

1097
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:37,720
It's blue.

1098
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:37,800
It's blue.

1099
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,160
It's blue.

1100
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:38,820
We're buddy.

1101
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,160
We're buddy.

1102
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:39,500
We're buddy.

1103
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:39,900
We're buddy.

1104
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,480
I'm buddy.

1105
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,320
I haven't killed anybody.

1106
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,180
I haven't killed anybody!

1107
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,460
Why are you sniffing me up and down?

1108
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,200
What do you mean again?

1109
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,100
I'm buddy!

1110
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,220
I'm buddy.

1111
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:55,880
I'm buddy.

1112
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:55,960
I'm buddy.

1113
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,720
Full on ration.

1114
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,200
I'm too good at this game.

1115
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,100
I forgot the... What's it called?

1116
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,640
The solid eye has a battery life.

1117
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,280
I think I went in through the wrong entrance, buddy.

1118
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,000
Buddy, I gotta go back from where... Oh, it's just me.

1119
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:29,740
I'm buddy.

1120
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,050
I can't see anything.

1121
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:41,530
There we go.

1122
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:43,990
That is the right way!

1123
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:46,090
How do I get through?

1124
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,590
Get the rations.

1125
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:48,970
I'm full on rations.

1126
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,470
It told me.

1127
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:51,370
Wait, hold on.

1128
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,210
It's gotta be the right way.

1129
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,790
Unless there's another entrance over here.

1130
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,190
Yeah, see?

1131
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:58,750
It's fine.

1132
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,630
I can get more stuff.

1133
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:02,150
There we go.

1134
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,170
Move the camera.

1135
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:05,610
There we go.

1136
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,230
Where are we going?

1137
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,010
This is just an adventure.

1138
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:16,810
I'm venting.

1139
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:17,470
I'm venting.

1140
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,470
This way.

1141
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,110
What's over here?

1142
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,530
I don't think I'm in the right spot.

1143
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,430
What's over here?

1144
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,310
Ammo.

1145
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,090
I think I just went in a big old circle.

1146
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:45,510
I'm going back in there.

1147
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,610
Maybe I'm silly.

1148
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:49,490
Maybe I'm silly.

1149
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,530
But we got another weapon, which is good.

1150
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,250
Because you sell those.

1151
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,510
It is in here.

1152
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,570
It's in here.

1153
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,260
A great circle, perhaps?

1154
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:06,400
Oops.

1155
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,300
You're certainly silly, but you may not be wrong.

1156
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,000
I can't remember.

1157
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:16,760
It's okay.

1158
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,200
It's just Minto.

1159
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,420
We're buddy.

1160
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,240
We are buddy.

1161
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,640
Why are you so silly?

1162
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:26,880
Militiaman.

1163
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,140
He's looking me up and down.

1164
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,920
Don't be jealous of my bod.

1165
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:33,880
Come on.

1166
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:34,660
I'm going.

1167
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,170
What is that?

1168
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,710
I got god.

1169
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:50,810
Wait.

1170
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,310
Not here.

1171
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,110
No, no, no.

1172
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:00,970
Is there a way to scroll?

1173
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,370
Come on, snake.

1174
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,150
Your butt can fit through there.

1175
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:05,670
I promise.

1176
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,910
Keep using the night vision.

1177
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:13,730
Clearly.

1178
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:18,950
They're like, you can't figure it out without the night vision, you dummy dum-dum.

1179
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,570
Oh, I'm buddy.

1180
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,110
I'm buddy, I'm buddy, I'm buddy.

1181
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:25,410
Hey!

1182
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:26,370
Oh, wait.

1183
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,490
You're...

1184
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,490
You are...

1185
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:36,870
You're yellow.

1186
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,210
He is not buddy.

1187
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:44,110
But the chicken...

1188
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,390
Do you think he'll attack me?

1189
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,170
Oh, hello.

1190
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:52,150
It's me.

1191
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,470
You're not going to attack with the chickens around.

1192
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:59,690
He's going to look me up and down and then he's going to realize buddy.

1193
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:04,750
Blue.

1194
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:06,230
Blue buddy.

1195
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,190
Why does everyone hate me?

1196
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:12,750
What have I done?

1197
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,890
Why do they all recognize me but have such a disdain for me?

1198
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,950
These poor chickens, I can't, they're so sad.

1199
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:23,150
No, I'm sorry chickens.

1200
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,690
Everybody recognizes me but they like think I suck.

1201
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,550
What if I give him... How do I give them food?

1202
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:40,230
How do I give him like something to... How do I make him like my real, real buddy?

1203
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,750
Is this the usual room?

1204
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,790
Oh no.

1205
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:49,830
Drop it, let's see.

1206
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:50,930
Items.

1207
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:56,670
Oh, sorry, I pressed circle like this is a JP game instead of X.

1208
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:04,250
It doesn't count as a ration, does it?

1209
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,450
No, all items.

1210
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,250
Noodles.

1211
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,590
Okay, bowl of instant noodles.

1212
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,400
How do I drop it?

1213
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,520
You hand it to him.

1214
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:29,960
Here we go.

1215
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,660
Hey buddy!

1216
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,340
He's in love with me now.

1217
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,440
All it takes... Everybody bonds over the noodles, you know?

1218
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,680
Everybody bonds over the noodles.

1219
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,400
Let's go!

1220
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,110
You want some noodles?

1221
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:58,330
Not the usual room.

1222
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:59,750
Don't send me back.

1223
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,290
If you win, that means you are a good chicken.

1224
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:06,830
I'm buddy.

1225
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:11,730
I'm buddy.

1226
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,310
Oh what?

1227
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:15,570
You selfish!

1228
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,770
Oh my god and then he runs off!

1229
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,790
That was not meant for you!

1230
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:24,830
Oh my god.

1231
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:28,290
It hurts.

1232
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,150
Sometimes the... Please.

1233
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:38,170
Sometimes it's so sensitive, you know?

1234
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,450
See, you can't get too close to it.

1235
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:44,370
You just gotta be enough close to it to be able to get on top of it.

1236
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,290
You know what I mean?

1237
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:51,030
You have to be walking at it.

1238
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,370
There we go.

1239
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:54,390
The pizazzamine!

1240
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,870
Hello

1241
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,960
ally buddies.

1242
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,300
I gotta get my solid eye back up.

1243
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,460
It's that way but what was over...

1244
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,940
I got a compress.

1245
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:14,960
Oh hi!

1246
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,140
I'm buddy!

1247
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,000
This guy is literally dying and I'm just like...

1248
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,060
Hello.

1249
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,580
Why do they hate me?

1250
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,680
Why do they hate me?

1251
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,720
Oh no!

1252
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,060
These are locked but we can sell them.

1253
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,900
Ew.

1254
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,280
Stinky.

1255
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,200
Everybody in here is smelly.

1256
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,300
Me too now.

1257
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,020
Is there anything in here?

1258
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,650
Just my hands.

1259
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,010
Just my hands.

1260
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:05,950
Check my weapons.

1261
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,910
Snakes feel good.

1262
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:07,970
My weapons.

1263
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:08,490
What about them?

1264
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,110
Nasty.

1265
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,830
You got anything else that I can have?

1266
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,110
Oh hell yeah.

1267
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:19,650
We got a grenade.

1268
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,150
What about you?

1269
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:25,310
If only this were MGS5 then we would actually get stinky.

1270
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,230
Oh I'm full.

1271
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,050
Bye bye.

1272
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,280
You guys okay?

1273
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,020
Yeah, you guys are okay.

1274
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,000
You guys are okay.

1275
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:41,980
Thank you.

1276
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:44,820
Are you winning?

1277
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:45,820
Yeah.

1278
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,760
I'm exploring a little bit.

1279
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,040
Oh, this one is green.

1280
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:51,300
Hello.

1281
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,140
Hi.

1282
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,920
I'm really...

1283
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,980
Oh my god.

1284
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,360
Oh my god.

1285
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,360
Just kiss already.

1286
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,780
He likes me.

1287
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,320
He likes me.

1288
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,060
He likes me.

1289
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:11,480
Oh.

1290
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,080
Okay.

1291
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,120
What is that?

1292
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,060
Oh, that's the...

1293
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,860
That's the wings that that one...

1294
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,540
You felt the rope.

1295
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,240
The other guy just noticed.

1296
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,060
He has no survival instincts.

1297
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,320
Yeah, it's the wing of one of the beauties.

1298
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,080
Why do you all hate me?

1299
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:35,960
I'm going.

1300
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:36,520
I'm going.

1301
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,480
I'm taking your stuff a little bit first.

1302
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:46,650
It's flapping.

1303
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:47,270
I know.

1304
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,370
It's so creepy.

1305
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,090
Wow.

1306
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,290
I don't...

1307
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:53,970
Maybe I just didn't notice that before.

1308
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,090
They need noodles?

1309
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,450
You're not you when you're hungry.

1310
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:01,250
Come here.

1311
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,050
You're with us?

1312
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:11,390
Why are you so surprised?

1313
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:14,330
Hold on.

1314
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,750
Wasn't there... or maybe...

1315
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,090
Oh, okay.

1316
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:18,910
I got something else.

1317
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,090
I feel like I'm gonna have to find a different spot for me to hang out in.

1318
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,070
We're almost out of noodles.

1319
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,170
Oh, this is a wall.

1320
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,070
Okay.

1321
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,250
They're green.

1322
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:36,070
They're green now.

1323
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,270
Did you notice that?

1324
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,850
Look at my footprints everywhere.

1325
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:44,130
Alright.

1326
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:46,710
It's me.

1327
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,460
Oh, okay.

1328
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,060
He doesn't care.

1329
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,560
Me?

1330
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,880
Oh, his little heart.

1331
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,560
I don't have an enemy gun.

1332
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,660
I mean, I do, but I'm gonna sell it for...

1333
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:11,520
for big money.

1334
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,300
That's what I'm gonna do.

1335
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,740
They're friends now.

1336
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,100
Yeah.

1337
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,020
That's locked.

1338
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,380
Playboy magazine!

1339
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,260
I cannot believe it's actually listed as a Playboy.

1340
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,040
That's crazy.

1341
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,460
The product placement in this game is absolutely wild.

1342
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:32,460
Bonkers.

1343
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:33,900
Bonkers wild.

1344
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,100
Oh, this guy is yellow.

1345
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,460
Hello!

1346
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,320
Maybe I'm more stealthy than I think.

1347
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,460
Like, I can just stand here.

1348
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:45,960
Hello.

1349
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:48,760
Hello.

1350
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,240
Like, if they weren't my friends, I think I'd be able to get away with it.

1351
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:55,820
You know?

1352
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,040
Hello.

1353
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:03,130
Oh, I don't think they care actually.

1354
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,270
I'm not important enough for them to even greet me.

1355
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,470
This is so sad.

1356
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,340
Our buddies!

1357
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,020
Yeah, it's me.

1358
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,680
Okay, so this is where we were on the other side.

1359
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,040
Perfect.

1360
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,680
Try and conceal his gun.

1361
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,020
No!

1362
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,820
I kicked the can.

1363
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,420
That's so messed up if I was trying to sneak through here or kick the can.

1364
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,060
Full ration.

1365
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,640
I would have...

1366
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,240
I got a petrol bomb.

1367
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,360
I would have made all sorts of noise and they would have gotten me.

1368
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,700
I would have gotten got.

1369
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,140
I missed a cardboard box?

1370
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,080
Wait, where at?

1371
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:56,880
Here?

1372
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,220
No less ration.

1373
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,100
I missed a box?

1374
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:00,640
Where at?

1375
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,260
Unless you mean all these cardboard boxes?

1376
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,320
Also a militia outfit?

1377
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,240
Wait, where?

1378
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,900
I thought I saw everything.

1379
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,040
Right over here, right?

1380
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,140
No.

1381
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:22,630
It's a box under a vent system.

1382
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:25,590
We already have them because new game plus.

1383
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,550
Wait, let me check my items.

1384
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:28,350
Are you sure?

1385
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,950
I don't think so.

1386
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:31,650
I really don't think I have much of anything.

1387
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:37,190
I have... Oh no, I do.

1388
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:38,050
I have a box.

1389
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,510
I have a drum can.

1390
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,470
But I do not have an outfit.

1391
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:48,890
I do not have an outfit.

1392
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:52,750
Arsenal.

1393
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,090
Oh, this is the compress.

1394
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:57,050
Neat.

1395
01:25:58,830 --> 01:25:59,750
Outfit is in camo.

1396
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:04,610
Cool.

1397
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,530
Outfit is in camo.

1398
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:12,890
Change costume.

1399
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,560
Check the face camo?

1400
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,440
Oh no, I might have the beauties.

1401
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,000
Oh no.

1402
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,260
Oh god.

1403
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,340
No, I'm not.

1404
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,260
Oh my god.

1405
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,720
It's so over for me.

1406
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:15,220
Oh my god, it's so...

1407
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:31,180
I look so dumb with her.

1408
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,640
I love Fem Raiden.

1409
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:39,770
Okay, this might be the worst one.

1410
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:43,430
They all look so... They all look so dumb with the neck.

1411
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:47,870
Like the neck pieces make it look so awful.

1412
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:50,370
Oh, these are spoilers?

1413
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:54,370
Yeah, kind of.

1414
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,910
I cannot equip the face camo.

1415
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,730
Oh handsome.

1416
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:02,610
Handsome lad right here.

1417
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,190
It's just spoilers on future bosses.

1418
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:07,910
Sorry guys.

1419
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,090
Oh my gosh, his...

1420
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:23,950
The pixels define his cheekbones so well.

1421
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,750
Depends on what you count as a spoiler.

1422
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,130
I think that... Oh my gosh, we can watch Sunny, I forgot.

1423
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:34,750
I consider story...

1424
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:42,330
Story spoilers more as spoilers than like what kind of... Like, you know, than boss spoilers.

1425
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,850
But I understand that.

1426
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:47,510
If someone's just like, I don't want to know about anything until it happens.

1427
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:48,490
You know.

1428
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:50,870
Sunny nanny cam.

1429
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,950
What is she looking for?

1430
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,130
She's trying to learn how to twerk.

1431
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,090
Don't do that, Sunny.

1432
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,150
You're too pure.

1433
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,910
Actually, oh, she's learning the gravure poses.

1434
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:07,290
She's reading the magazines and she's learning the poses.

1435
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:11,070
Sunny!

1436
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,330
Sunny, stop!

1437
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,490
Sunny, wait until you're older!

1438
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:20,190
Oh my god, that one is...

1439
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,190
She's the cutest ever.

1440
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,110
Oh...

1441
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,530
It's like watching a puppy.

1442
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,230
She's the cutest thing.

1443
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,670
Oh gosh.

1444
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:34,750
I love Sunny.

1445
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:37,290
Best girl, so true.

1446
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:38,750
There she goes.

1447
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:45,750
But yeah, I don't have the camouflage for the militia.

1448
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:49,210
So where can I get that?

1449
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:51,990
Oh wait, I'm such an idiot.

1450
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,890
Yes I do.

1451
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:55,070
It says ME, Middle East.

1452
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,830
I do have it.

1453
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,690
It's so messed up looking.

1454
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,190
Oh, it was this way.

1455
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Mint East one.

1456
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,060
You have other weapons.

1457
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,140
Oh my god, do I have so much?

1458
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,880
I just don't realize it.

1459
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,080
Wait, what else do I have?

1460
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,620
I forgot.

1461
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:27,420
Wait, what is she doing?

1462
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,940
She's gaming.

1463
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,180
Oh my god!

1464
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,860
Wait, some of these are locked.

1465
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,840
It kept everything.

1466
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,100
It kept everything.

1467
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:46,940
Spoiler.

1468
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,460
But I feel like I'm gonna be using...

1469
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,380
I don't have very many tranquilizing stuff.

1470
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,520
So I feel like I'm gonna be using...

1471
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,420
We'll put this in too.

1472
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,320
ID locked.

1473
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,420
I have to unlock them.

1474
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,400
I don't really need that though.

1475
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,240
I feel...

1476
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:22,050
Bleh, boy.

1477
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:26,010
The babes of the world's top PMCs.

1478
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:28,470
Hideo Kojima interviewed.

1479
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:30,790
I can't read what it says in the red part though.

1480
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,730
Something or...

1481
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:34,730
Nano...

1482
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:35,390
Beast?

1483
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,850
The truth behind...

1484
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:40,670
Something drone.

1485
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:43,890
Oh, here we go.

1486
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,110
The games and beyond.

1487
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:49,110
Hideo Kojima interviewed.

1488
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:52,070
Nano boost or nano bust.

1489
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:54,310
The truth behind nano drone.

1490
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:57,470
The best FPSs of the year.

1491
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:00,270
Can you believe we used to pay for these things?

1492
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,950
He's pirating his games.

1493
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,390
7th circle.

1494
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,470
Sadistic joke becomes prime time sensation.

1495
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,690
Entertainment for men and Minto.

1496
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:25,090
Staring at one of these in a first person view...

1497
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:27,290
Curiously raises Snake's psyche.

1498
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:30,990
Okay, we'll definitely have that on the...

1499
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:31,910
In the bar then.

1500
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,090
We'll have that.

1501
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:34,950
We'll have that out.

1502
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:35,230
Okay.

1503
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,990
Alright, let's go.

1504
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:43,960
Oh, golly.

1505
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,880
If I put it down, I can grab it back.

1506
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,740
I can pick it back up, I'm pretty sure.

1507
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,800
Raises something for sure.

1508
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,220
Don't say that.

1509
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,380
Oh, I should have changed the face.

1510
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,500
Oh, I have you.

1511
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,500
Oh no, Drebin forgot to change the face for the...

1512
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,620
Oh, monkey!

1513
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,020
It's a fucking monkey!

1514
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,660
The monkey with the caffeine addiction.

1515
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,180
Oh...

1516
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:28,500
I should have changed the face, I'm sorry.

1517
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,600
Oh, Drebin.

1518
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,280
Talking monkey.

1519
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,480
He comes in peace.

1520
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,240
Hey, hey, hey.

1521
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,280
You can't just say that.

1522
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,740
You're not him.

1523
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:53,340
You are not him.

1524
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,580
Drebin is such a silly character.

1525
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,200
The little head bob, I know.

1526
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,320
It's too good.

1527
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,180
He's like...

1528
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:24,200
I take ID guns like the PMCs use and make some mods.

1529
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,000
Then you can use them without having to match IDs.

1530
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:28,900
The music is too good.

1531
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,680
In other words, I'm a gun launderer.

1532
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,160
You can call me Drebin.

1533
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,020
Drebin!

1534
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,800
Yeah, they use that for all of us.

1535
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,440
I have you.

1536
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,720
All over the world.

1537
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,020
Not that I ever met any of them personally.

1538
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:47,040
Me, I'm Drebin number 893.

1539
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,150
You ain't a registered PMC employee.

1540
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:00,710
Are you?

1541
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:04,130
You need a guy like me.

1542
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:07,070
Judgment, guys.

1543
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:08,730
Welcome to membership.

1544
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,330
Thank you.

1545
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,550
Consider it a welcome gift.

1546
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:13,210
Truly dystopian ID locked guns.

1547
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,010
I know, right?

1548
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:14,690
It's crazy.

1549
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:23,470
I forgot how bad graphics were back then.

1550
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,370
Are you talking about Steak's face?

1551
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:33,370
Gosh, these dang PS3 graphics are horrible.

1552
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,790
The graphics are actually just so good.

1553
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:55,510
You can see the velvety-ness of Drebin.

1554
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,370
Like his tie, you know.

1555
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,270
It's crazy.

1556
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:05,810
He's nerding out.

1557
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:08,790
Noobs.

1558
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:25,170
Pew!

1559
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:47,470
I like the camo pants and the blazer top.

1560
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,990
I'm in charge of production control.

1561
01:36:55,990 --> 01:37:00,110
So I get my hands on all the ID chips before they even register.

1562
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,310
Have a sit.

1563
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:05,270
Indirect kissu.

1564
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:09,890
It's a side of AT the public don't see.

1565
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:14,690
From the looks of it, you ain't with any state army.

1566
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:19,470
But you ain't exactly green either.

1567
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:20,710
Mm-mm.

1568
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:37,190
Chill.

1569
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:48,270
Talk to me, Otacon.

1570
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,160
What's your take on him, Otacon?

1571
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:58,760
Sunny!

1572
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,580
Balkans.

1573
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,760
How's he pull it off, anyway?

1574
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,880
Brain hurts.

1575
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,240
Oh.

1576
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:46,380
Hmm.

1577
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,400
Hmm.

1578
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,120
A little weasel.

1579
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,140
Yeah.

1580
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:08,740
Yeah.

1581
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,440
I mean...

1582
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,500
I'm not asking him out on a date or anything.

1583
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,840
It's just business.

1584
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,280
No, caffeine addicted monkey!

1585
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,020
Don't let him drink another soda!

1586
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:46,200
Oh, I have already.

1587
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,780
Hell yes.

1588
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,500
Woo!

1589
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,860
No romancing, Drebin.

1590
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,060
What you got for me?

1591
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,140
What you got for me?

1592
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,700
Drebin893.

1593
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,460
Not the vending machine!

1594
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:24,360
Can I buy more sody?

1595
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:32,310
The alien.

1596
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:40,840
lol Oh no.

1597
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:42,460
Scary.

1598
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:56,780
So I have to have nanomachines after nanomachines on top of nanomachines.

1599
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:01,320
Yeah.

1600
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,040
Monkey!

1601
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,540
lol

1602
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:12,210
Tell me when it's over!

1603
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:18,470
Ok, it's not so bad since it's PS1 Snake.

1604
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:24,990
They work so fast.

1605
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,270
Noodles, welcome to membership.

1606
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,070
Thank you.

1607
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:31,090
He's got a Lakers 2009 rings?

1608
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:31,890
What the hell?

1609
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:36,470
He's a Lakers fan?

1610
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:42,530
Don't be mean to the monkey!

1611
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:49,270
He's just a monkey.

1612
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:24,230
Why are you so addicted to the soda?

1613
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:30,550
1 hexo, welcome to membership.

1614
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,350
Thank you!

1615
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:33,110
System codes are the law now.

1616
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,870
And control is essentially absolute.

1617
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:41,290
Paving the way for fat profits, if you're willing to bend the law.

1618
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:45,070
Demand keeps on growing thanks to the war economy.

1619
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:49,390
I sell ID guns to the PMCs and state armies.

1620
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:53,090
And make it guns to terrorist groups and paramilitaries.

1621
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,770
And these ID guns can't be sold on the black market.

1622
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:02,350
System's practically a license for us arms dealers to print money.

1623
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:08,110
Privatizing the military has made the PMCs big and bloated.

1624
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:15,370
The fatter the PMCs get, the line between civilian and soldier is gonna get real blurry.

1625
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,900
Sooner or later, the whole damn human race is gonna be green collars.

1626
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:30,040
More like, we're all gonna be fighting proxy wars.

1627
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:35,960
That's just a theory.

1628
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,180
A game theory.

1629
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,460
What eyes?

1630
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,300
He's got no eyes.

1631
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,900
Thank you.

1632
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,720
Bye Driven!

1633
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,960
Let's go.

1634
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Bye monkey!

1635
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,280
Tank monkey.

1636
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:43,120
Man, the war economy.

1637
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:01,420
And we're back outside, baby.

1638
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,400
I don't think I need my disguise, honestly.

1639
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:10,260
I think I'm fine with the camo.

1640
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,500
Skyline, welcome to membership!

1641
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,620
Thank you!

1642
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:18,860
Hello?

1643
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:21,380
Thank you, thank you!

1644
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:37,900
I think then you can make money in different places.

1645
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:41,240
Open a lemonade stand.

1646
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:46,900
World peace?

1647
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,560
Can you imagine?

1648
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,180
Sell ice cream.

1649
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:00,460
Yeah.

1650
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,460
Why don't we invest money into robot anime girls instead?

1651
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,580
Make love.

1652
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,600
Not war.

1653
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:27,640
The Driven menu item.

1654
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,820
The Driven menu item.

1655
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:41,380
Make the cat girls real.

1656
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,420
I see.

1657
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,020
Rat patrol.

1658
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,300
Rat patrol, you say.

1659
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:11,800
Alright.

1660
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,800
Oh my god.

1661
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:16,680
Monkey.

1662
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,960
I get that.

1663
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:34,900
Because, yeah, if you need a weapon you can literally just buy it from him.

1664
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,380
So I do get that.

1665
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:43,380
But that's also what they do in MGS5 and nobody complains about that.

1666
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,920
Holy moly!

1667
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,700
I have 200,000 DP.

1668
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:50,200
1,000,000 DP!

1669
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:55,240
We'll be able to get the big bucks, baby.

1670
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:57,580
Look at all this.

1671
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,940
5,000,000!

1672
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,520
For the bandana!

1673
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,780
Then I would have unlimited ammo.

1674
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:11,580
Ok, we're gonna save up 5,000,000 DP.

1675
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,840
What's this one?

1676
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,020
Is this just stealth camo?

1677
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:19,120
Ok, we're gonna save up 10...wait, that's...

1678
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,140
5,000,000!

1679
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,960
We're gonna save up 10,000,000 DP.

1680
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:32,040
This is the first and so far only MGS I managed to beat entirely non-lethally.

1681
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:32,860
Really?

1682
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,120
Receipt?

1683
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,880
Oh, thank you for your patronage.

1684
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,460
You're welcome.

1685
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,020
Ok, 10,000,000!

1686
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,880
What else we got?

1687
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,840
Suppressor, suppressor, suppressor, suppressor.

1688
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:55,960
Oh, wow.

1689
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,660
Oh, lights.

1690
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:58,220
Oh.

1691
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:02,160
Bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets...

1692
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,740
Not looking at those.

1693
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:08,720
Gosh.

1694
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:13,940
If you couldn't tell, yes, this is New Game Plus, so...

1695
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:16,500
I do have everything.

1696
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:18,960
Alright.

1697
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,680
I'm gonna save real quick.

1698
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,720
No, I can save over the old data.

1699
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,180
Play the iPod?

1700
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,180
What do you wanna hear?

1701
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,540
What do you wanna hear?

1702
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,460
I'll play my favorite song.

1703
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,640
Hold on, it's saving.

1704
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,040
My favorite song.

1705
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:52,440
Music.

1706
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,060
Wait, how do I?

1707
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:56,420
Scroll.

1708
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:56,940
Oh, scroll.

1709
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:58,960
I forgot it's the iPod.

1710
01:49:59,060 --> 01:49:59,580
Oh, my God.

1711
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,200
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1712
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,140
Wait, there we go.

1713
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,680
I have to hold it down.

1714
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,320
Song.

1715
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,580
We have Calling to the Night?

1716
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,260
Hold on.

1717
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:32,010
Song!

1718
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,090
Look at Sunny.

1719
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:33,870
Oh, my God, you're right.

1720
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:36,010
Eee!

1721
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:51,990
Look at her!

1722
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:54,650
This is the best game ever.

1723
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:56,450
This is the best game ever!

1724
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:58,710
It really has everything.

1725
01:50:58,890 --> 01:50:59,650
It's so great.

1726
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,720
I wish I had a full version.

1727
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,310
Find a karaoke.

1728
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:39,110
I would love to sing.

1729
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:46,290
Sorry, Minto, but my new Oshi is Sunny.

1730
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,230
I don't blame you.

1731
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,270
This is gonna become a Sunny fan channel.

1732
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,790
I'm gonna start doing just Sunny clips.

1733
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:57,150
This song is so cute.

1734
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:03,450
Okie.

1735
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:08,790
The only way across is straight through.

1736
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:10,870
Straight through.

1737
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:29,770
I wish I could still listen to it and have my... Ok, hold on.

1738
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:33,670
Oh, you can get Taiga there.

1739
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:38,870
Oh yeah, let's change from the... Let's change from this song.

1740
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:47,190
I wonder why I can't equip this.

1741
01:52:51,370 --> 01:52:52,810
Let's just do the Octocamel.

1742
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:03,070
Ok, I'll be careful.

1743
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:15,190
I hear people dropping things.

1744
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,650
Do you hear that?

1745
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,330
It's so crazy.

1746
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,360
I don't think I can.

1747
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:38,700
Ok.

1748
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:42,160
Everybody's dying.

1749
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,760
Everybody's dying and here I am.

1750
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,700
Oh, I have full ration.

1751
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,880
I'm listening to the happiest music.

1752
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,120
Nevermind, we're not going that way.

1753
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:56,140
Just kidding.

1754
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:58,980
Or maybe we can.

1755
01:53:59,200 --> 01:53:59,880
I don't know actually.

1756
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,740
I'll take your stuff.

1757
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:15,250
Ok, you guys like that?

1758
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:16,710
Alright, now I need to know where I'm going.

1759
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:27,750
I think I do go this way though actually.

1760
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:33,850
Yeah, I'm lost.

1761
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:55,460
Snake.

1762
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:56,520
Snake, go up.

1763
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,980
It's through here.

1764
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:03,440
Oh no.

1765
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,460
Oh shoot.

1766
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,380
There's more stuff.

1767
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:12,480
Oh, this is the guy that I tried to get earlier.

1768
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,100
Oh, it's just ammo.

1769
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:14,900
It's fine.

1770
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,080
It's

1771
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:21,920
fine.

1772
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,880
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

1773
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:29,530
Yeah, I don't sound Willis anymore.

1774
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:29,930
Don't worry.

1775
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,430
This is friend.

1776
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:34,970
This is friend.

1777
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,090
This is friend.

1778
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:43,790
Oh no.

1779
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:45,650
Oh no.

1780
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:54,970
I'm not going to lie you guys.

1781
01:55:56,570 --> 01:56:00,150
This is unironically what Paz sounds like when she shits.

1782
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,750
I wanted to rename Paz Johnny.

1783
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:09,530
Because this is actually what she sounds like when she's using the litter box.

1784
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:22,710
Oh, the cat.

1785
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:23,470
Yeah, my cat.

1786
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:24,650
What else did you think about?

1787
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:30,190
My cat.

1788
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:32,610
I already have these, but that's ok.

1789
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:36,530
I thought you meant Paz.

1790
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:37,710
Yeah, Paz is my cat.

1791
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:40,070
It's clean.

1792
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:42,890
Snake, I still wouldn't.

1793
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:44,530
Snake, I wouldn't.

1794
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:46,410
Snake, no.

1795
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:47,210
Snake.

1796
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:49,070
It probably reeks in there.

1797
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:50,050
Don't do it.

1798
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:50,810
No, don't.

1799
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,150
Not your head.

1800
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:53,170
Snake.

1801
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,050
Sorry I'm late.

1802
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:01,590
I didn't know they made a prequel for MGSV.

1803
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:03,030
When does Venom show up?

1804
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,410
He's my favorite boss.

1805
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:05,270
Stop it.

1806
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:08,250
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

1807
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:09,270
Thank you.

1808
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:10,710
What's over in here?

1809
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,050
Got it.

1810
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:18,170
I got it.

1811
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:18,950
Oh wait.

1812
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:19,710
Oh, here it is.

1813
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:20,430
Oh, it's the rations.

1814
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:24,130
Gosh, we're getting lots of playboy, huh?

1815
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:26,230
Lucky us.

1816
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,990
Ok.

1817
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:31,830
Rendezvous point.

1818
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,160
Who is not our friend?

1819
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:43,920
Ok, I can see them.

1820
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,260
I'm helping.

1821
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,420
Oh my gosh.

1822
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:53,140
Oh, sorry.

1823
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:54,420
Oh, I had to reload anyway.

1824
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:55,340
That was good.

1825
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,960
I think I got him.

1826
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,500
Maybe I didn't, actually.

1827
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,260
I think I got him that time.

1828
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:10,520
You're welcome.

1829
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:14,880
I am.

1830
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,080
Well, you know.

1831
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:17,340
I'm doing my best.

1832
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:18,880
I'm doing my best.

1833
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:21,340
Oh gosh, there's really big guys coming up.

1834
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:24,100
You're welcome.

1835
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,720
But like, that's a whole ass tank.

1836
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,640
I can't put that to sleep.

1837
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,660
Hey, stop pushing me out of the way.

1838
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,080
You're going to ruin my shot.

1839
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:35,700
Oh, I don't think I got that guy.

1840
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,860
You're going to ruin my shot.

1841
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,060
Where are they?

1842
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,300
Everything is sold.

1843
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,000
Everything is sold.

1844
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,260
You can try.

1845
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:49,160
True.

1846
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:49,600
True.

1847
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:52,340
Where are they shooting from anyway?

1848
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:53,200
I can't even see.

1849
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:57,910
Oh my God.

1850
01:58:58,870 --> 01:58:59,270
They

1851
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:04,290
are going sicko mode.

1852
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:05,110
Oh my God.

1853
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,890
I'm trying to help.

1854
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,390
Oh, that's not...

1855
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,190
I know.

1856
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,310
I think I got him.

1857
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,710
Then why did you send me this way, Otacon?

1858
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:26,750
You think I could grenade it?

1859
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,750
Nevermind.

1860
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:30,110
You don't need me.

1861
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:31,330
I got this.

1862
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:34,050
Me?

1863
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:36,750
Are you talking to me?

1864
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:37,550
Oh my God.

1865
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:40,010
I need to go that way.

1866
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:41,070
Like, kind of.

1867
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:42,770
Oh shoot.

1868
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:47,790
Which way?

1869
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:57,630
Is this a... Can I go through here?

1870
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:00,510
Can I crawl under this?

1871
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,470
Oh damn, I can.

1872
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:12,340
I'm kind of going the opposite way, but...

1873
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:14,500
Actually, this should help me get around, I think.

1874
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:16,580
Hello, friend.

1875
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:19,140
See?

1876
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:19,900
They love me.

1877
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,000
I'm helping you.

1878
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:21,620
Oh, shoot.

1879
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:23,020
I'm helping you guys.

1880
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:23,640
I'm helping you guys.

1881
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,080
I'm helping you guys.

1882
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:25,660
I'm helping you guys.

1883
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,000
Charge?

1884
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

1885
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1886
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,940
I mean, you can shoot them.

1887
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,520
You're welcome.

1888
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:35,500
Who?

1889
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:36,540
Who saw me?

1890
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,320
Wait, actually, who saw me?

1891
02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:50,150
Window?

1892
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:52,690
Oh, that guy up there.

1893
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:53,410
Oh my God.

1894
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:54,410
Why is this so dramatic?

1895
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:57,990
Oops.

1896
02:01:00,370 --> 02:01:01,170
You're welcome.

1897
02:01:04,430 --> 02:01:05,130
You're welcome.

1898
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:08,170
What do you mean?

1899
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:08,370
What do you mean?

1900
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:12,850
It's the... It's the, like, famous ass grab that everybody does.

1901
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:13,210
Oh, there.

1902
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:13,630
I see him.

1903
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:15,810
Sorry.

1904
02:01:16,130 --> 02:01:16,850
I'm helping you.

1905
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:17,430
I'm helping you.

1906
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:18,590
I'm helping you.

1907
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:19,130
I'm helping you.

1908
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,290
I got him.

1909
02:01:24,630 --> 02:01:25,490
Yeah, you're welcome.

1910
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:32,140
I don't know where else they're shooting from.

1911
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:36,780
I'm running with you guys.

1912
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,040
See?

1913
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:38,660
I'm such a good helper, aren't I?

1914
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:40,520
Who's shooting?

1915
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,180
Oh, that window.

1916
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:42,580
I see him.

1917
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:43,900
I got his ass.

1918
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,240
I got his ass.

1919
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:46,240
Oh, no I don't.

1920
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,180
Oh, I do?

1921
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,940
I got his ass.

1922
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,160
You're so welcome.

1923
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,340
I'm such a helper.

1924
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:00,550
One guy dropped his gun over here.

1925
02:02:02,230 --> 02:02:03,470
I hear them snoring.

1926
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:07,170
These lazy bones over here.

1927
02:02:08,050 --> 02:02:08,770
Oh, there it is.

1928
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:11,390
I watched him drop this earlier.

1929
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:15,030
It's a new gun even.

1930
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:16,430
Lucky me.

1931
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,670
Do I have to go around this way?

1932
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:20,190
I think.

1933
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:22,250
I think I go past the...

1934
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,680
Go past the tank.

1935
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:34,100
Any baddies?

1936
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,060
Where's my friends?

1937
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:40,720
Oh, shoot.

1938
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:41,500
That's not a friend.

1939
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,200
That's a foe.

1940
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:43,440
Let's see.

1941
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:44,320
How do I...

1942
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,060
Oh, shoot.

1943
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:50,980
Why does it only get upset when I'm here?

1944
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:53,000
What do you mean?

1945
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:53,760
No!

1946
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:54,720
Oh, shit.

1947
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:55,920
I'm so in trouble.

1948
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:58,380
I'm leaving.

1949
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:02,100
Maybe that is my friend.

1950
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,520
Oh my God.

1951
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:03,900
No!

1952
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:15,950
I wanted to add my drum can and my box.

1953
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:17,650
I forgot to add those earlier.

1954
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:19,590
There we go.

1955
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:22,030
Snake is getting upset.

1956
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,590
He's getting angry.

1957
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:30,570
I'm just on normal difficulty.

1958
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:33,070
I like to have fun with the game.

1959
02:03:33,970 --> 02:03:35,810
Look, we're so close to the rendezvous point.

1960
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:37,130
It's literally right there, you guys.

1961
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:39,790
I'm not toast.

1962
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:42,090
My camo index?

1963
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,010
I don't even know what it is.

1964
02:03:43,170 --> 02:03:44,210
Oh, it's negative 16.

1965
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:49,790
Okay, we're at 65.

1966
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:53,630
I don't know how we're still alert.

1967
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:55,390
I don't know how they're still seeing me.

1968
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:57,290
Oh, shoot.

1969
02:03:57,390 --> 02:03:58,130
They're still seeing me.

1970
02:03:58,370 --> 02:03:59,390
Oh, there's a guy right there.

1971
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:00,130
Oh my God.

1972
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:01,350
I can get his ass.

1973
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:05,650
There we go.

1974
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:08,290
See?

1975
02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:12,430
I don't know where anyone else is, though.

1976
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:13,990
See, we're fine.

1977
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:15,610
I just gotta keep going.

1978
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,700
Bro's staring at you, I know.

1979
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,580
I don't remember how to reload in this game.

1980
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,900
Equip, unequip doesn't work.

1981
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:34,820
Anyway.

1982
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,700
He's barely stressed.

1983
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,700
We're so fine.

1984
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:47,460
That's like me on a daily average.

1985
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,620
50% stress.

1986
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:50,700
Don't worry about it.

1987
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:56,620
I think I got him.

1988
02:04:57,460 --> 02:05:00,550
Hey friend, is he still alive?

1989
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:01,070
He's moving.

1990
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:05,610
Maybe not so much anymore.

1991
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:09,650
I got him.

1992
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:12,570
Oh, what do I do?

1993
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:14,510
Otacon, where do I go?

1994
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:15,590
Otacon!

1995
02:05:24,910 --> 02:05:25,990
Over here, maybe.

1996
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:28,050
Is that it?

1997
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:37,350
Is that another guy?

1998
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:38,710
Oh no, I don't see anyone else.

1999
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:40,750
I don't see anyone else.

2000
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:42,370
Maybe in the windows?

2001
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:44,490
There's like guns everywhere.

2002
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:45,610
There's just shooting everywhere.

2003
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,770
Hello friends, I'm coming in.

2004
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:50,670
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

2005
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:51,690
I'm here to help.

2006
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,250
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2007
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:54,250
I'm here to assist.

2008
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:55,310
I'm here to assist.

2009
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:00,290
I'm reloading.

2010
02:06:00,290 --> 02:06:01,950
I have no more bullets.

2011
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:02,910
Ok, bye.

2012
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:04,610
Good luck everybody else.

2013
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:11,540
But not before I earn more money.

2014
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:20,840
Oh, shoot the door shut.

2015
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:25,940
Anyway...

2016
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:28,600
Why am I such a big deal?

2017
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,700
There's enemies everywhere.

2018
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,660
Nice assist boss, you're welcome.

2019
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:38,260
I don't have any more ammo actually.

2020
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,720
You guys can't see it because I'm blocking it.

2021
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:43,740
I have to find a good place for my head.

2022
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,060
But no, I actually don't have any more ammo.

2023
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,000
As you can see.

2024
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:54,820
It's ok.

2025
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:00,200
Alright, where's the poop squad?

2026
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,420
Sorry, rat squad.

2027
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,300
Ranch ramp.

2028
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:06,000
Aren't there guys in here or am I crazy?

2029
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:11,120
Isn't this place crawling with people?

2030
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:13,620
Oh, it's not showing up on the...

2031
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:16,040
On the map, the mini map.

2032
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,000
Maybe we're ok.

2033
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:25,220
Locked weapon, projectile.

2034
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,320
Can I get over here?

2035
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:28,560
Come on snake.

2036
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:29,980
Jump over it.

2037
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,640
Jump over it with your hands.

2038
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:34,480
Hit circle.

2039
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:40,490
Thanks guys.

2040
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:42,910
I was trying to figure out how to reload earlier.

2041
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:48,190
Thank you.

2042
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:51,250
Ok, I don't think I can go in there.

2043
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:52,810
I give up.

2044
02:08:06,490 --> 02:08:06,930
That...

2045
02:08:06,930 --> 02:08:08,350
Wait, how do I zoom?

2046
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:09,230
Nope.

2047
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:14,290
I don't know.

2048
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:15,990
Use the mark too?

2049
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:18,810
We're just gonna sacrifice him like that?

2050
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:40,450
Gassy.

2051
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:47,610
Oh, I went in normal mode again.

2052
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:48,290
Thank you.

2053
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:54,560
Nice.

2054
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:55,920
Alright.

2055
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,020
Ok.

2056
02:08:58,680 --> 02:08:59,600
This way.

2057
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,920
So, let's go through...

2058
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,920
Let's go upstairs.

2059
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:07,040
Was it here?

2060
02:09:10,580 --> 02:09:12,180
There is a stairs.

2061
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,020
No, not downtown.

2062
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:13,880
Here we go.

2063
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:14,740
Upstairs.

2064
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:20,560
Mark too can grab those.

2065
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,260
Wait, no way.

2066
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:22,960
How so, I wonder.

2067
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,120
Still being guarded.

2068
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,740
I did not see that one.

2069
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,120
Oh, Snake are you...

2070
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,820
A triangle.

2071
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:36,140
Ok, I didn't see that one at all.

2072
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,120
I'm so sorry Snake.

2073
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:42,860
I'm so sorry.

2074
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:43,740
Sorry buddy.

2075
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:45,500
I didn't see it.

2076
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:46,620
I'm really sorry.

2077
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:48,020
Ok, here we go.

2078
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:48,280
Alright.

2079
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,440
Mark too.

2080
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:50,720
Deploy!

2081
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,320
I know, I know.

2082
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:58,220
I know, I know.

2083
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:59,080
I'm gonna get him.

2084
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:00,520
I'm not gonna use my solid eye.

2085
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:02,040
Triangle.

2086
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:04,800
Yoink!

2087
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:06,240
Ok.

2088
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:10,270
Ok.

2089
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:11,370
Nice.

2090
02:10:15,110 --> 02:10:16,830
They are recharging battery now.

2091
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:18,610
That is how it works, right?

2092
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:20,390
It recharges like when I'm not using it.

2093
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,860
I don't think there is any people in here.

2094
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:29,980
So...

2095
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:31,700
Not yet at least.

2096
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:34,460
Oh.

2097
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:35,660
Ok.

2098
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:38,590
Ok.

2099
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:41,350
Any other traps in here?

2100
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:44,270
Speaking of bathroom, I gotta go soon.

2101
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,370
To the bathroom I mean.

2102
02:10:47,050 --> 02:10:47,810
Not leave.

2103
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:49,270
Just bathroom stuff.

2104
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:51,830
Oh, can't open that.

2105
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:52,110
Alright.

2106
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:53,710
Onwards.

2107
02:10:54,690 --> 02:10:55,690
Onwards, forwards.

2108
02:10:57,610 --> 02:10:59,850
Ok, hold on.

2109
02:11:00,510 --> 02:11:01,390
Before we do that.

2110
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:03,890
God!

2111
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:05,970
I just turned the camera, please!

2112
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,570
Holy cannoli!

2113
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:10,570
Oh my gosh!

2114
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:14,790
I didn't even move!

2115
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:20,270
Alright, Otacon.

2116
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:25,150
You could have detected enemy.

2117
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:28,930
Yeah.

2118
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:31,090
Ok.

2119
02:11:34,650 --> 02:11:35,830
Fell for the ramen trap.

2120
02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:39,770
Then what do you want me to do?

2121
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:47,410
You guys keep an eye on Snake while I go to the little ghost room, ok?

2122
02:11:47,970 --> 02:11:49,410
Storm it with your face.

2123
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:50,850
Ok,

2124
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:55,620
I just gotta go pee real quick.

2125
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:56,120
I'll be fast.

2126
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,000
Ok.

2127
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:59,360
B, R, B.

2128
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:00,000
B, R, B.

2129
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,810
I'm back.

2130
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:11,210
I'm back, sorry.

2131
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:13,890
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2132
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:17,970
Thank you for the 50 Gets.

2133
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:18,750
Thank you.

2134
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:21,590
I wanted to go say hi to my cat.

2135
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:23,990
Alrighty.

2136
02:14:24,730 --> 02:14:26,330
How do I get through this again?

2137
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:27,470
Otacon, give me a hint.

2138
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,030
I don't remember.

2139
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:29,990
Tell me.

2140
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:31,430
Welcome back.

2141
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:32,190
I'm back.

2142
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:44,490
Look at that old Johnny.

2143
02:14:57,230 --> 02:14:58,190
Wait, so...

2144
02:14:58,190 --> 02:14:59,910
Yeah, see, my battery is now full.

2145
02:15:00,790 --> 02:15:01,170
Awesome.

2146
02:15:01,630 --> 02:15:05,410
I'm gonna figure out a good... Actually, let me... I think I can place myself.

2147
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:09,850
I'm gonna be a little bit of like a...

2148
02:15:10,410 --> 02:15:10,750
There.

2149
02:15:10,850 --> 02:15:18,130
I'm just gonna put myself here so that I'm not in the way of the interface and also not the subtitles.

2150
02:15:18,490 --> 02:15:19,650
There we go, that should be...

2151
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,770
Should be ok for now.

2152
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:22,490
I'll figure out something for future streams.

2153
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:25,890
Floating head Minto, yeah?

2154
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:30,270
Ok.

2155
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:33,790
So, later.

2156
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:37,770
Ok, then.

2157
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:39,630
Where do I go then, Otacon?

2158
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:42,550
I'm a little confused guy.

2159
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:45,090
I'm just a little confused man.

2160
02:15:46,610 --> 02:15:50,090
Ok, I can't run like that so much or Snake gets upset.

2161
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:52,570
His little psyche goes down because he's old.

2162
02:15:58,120 --> 02:15:59,960
Oh, we can go upstairs again.

2163
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:02,380
Yeah, let's go up.

2164
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:05,000
Senior!

2165
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:06,520
Thank you so...

2166
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:07,920
Much further!

2167
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:08,540
20?

2168
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:09,500
Thank you!

2169
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:16,000
I almost got it.

2170
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:17,800
I almost got hit.

2171
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,000
I almost got hit.

2172
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:21,400
I saw it at the last second.

2173
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,040
Look how cute he is!

2174
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,480
Oh my god, it's too cute.

2175
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,800
It's too cute the way he hops up the stairs.

2176
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:39,820
You see that?

2177
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:45,580
Too cute!

2178
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:46,940
Is there any other ones?

2179
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:48,600
Yeah!

2180
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:49,300
Yeah!

2181
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:50,180
Yeah!

2182
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:51,080
Yeah!

2183
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:51,940
Yeah!

2184
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:52,740
Yeah!

2185
02:16:56,690 --> 02:16:57,850
I'm looking.

2186
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:58,950
I'm perusing.

2187
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:01,330
I'm gathering intel.

2188
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:04,050
I'm gathering intel.

2189
02:17:09,410 --> 02:17:10,810
I'm gathering intel.

2190
02:17:11,070 --> 02:17:12,710
This thing is so freaking loud.

2191
02:17:15,490 --> 02:17:16,470
Dual flip!

2192
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:18,430
Another one!

2193
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:23,500
I'm gathering intel.

2194
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:24,480
I'm gathering intel.

2195
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:29,780
Yeah, we're...

2196
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:31,780
I never knew about that.

2197
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,700
Oh my gosh, he can knock too.

2198
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:35,540
You are so clever.

2199
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:37,980
I never used Mark 2 before.

2200
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:39,740
Honestly, like when I played before.

2201
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,600
I didn't use it much at all.

2202
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,780
So, this is all kind of new for me too.

2203
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:51,730
Anything in here?

2204
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:56,030
That I can grab and then we'll run around and let the battery recharge.

2205
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:00,310
Wait.

2206
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:01,430
Oh no, nevermind.

2207
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:01,810
Just kidding.

2208
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:07,570
I think we're mostly okay.

2209
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:10,070
Somebody is baking cookies.

2210
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,090
Where do you see that?

2211
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:20,370
Sorry, I'm going a little... I'm like zooming around with him because I'm trying to like just...

2212
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:25,430
I'm only trying to...

2213
02:18:29,090 --> 02:18:29,530
Okay.

2214
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:30,950
Okay.

2215
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,750
We'll bring him back.

2216
02:18:32,790 --> 02:18:33,450
We'll bring him back.

2217
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,850
What was I saying?

2218
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:39,430
I don't remember.

2219
02:18:45,470 --> 02:18:47,330
And now we can use him.

2220
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:49,250
Our little guy.

2221
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:53,530
I don't think I saw anything else in these rooms.

2222
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:56,490
Let's go check that back area that I...

2223
02:18:57,030 --> 02:18:58,890
Oh, we didn't get to go back here either.

2224
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:01,310
Careful.

2225
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:02,530
Easy snake.

2226
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:03,690
Easy snake.

2227
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:04,290
Wait.

2228
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:05,390
Right there!

2229
02:19:09,930 --> 02:19:11,570
This game still looks amazing.

2230
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:12,710
It's insane, right?

2231
02:19:13,310 --> 02:19:16,490
It's actually so crazy.

2232
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:21,090
I say that about honestly like all the Metal Gear games.

2233
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:21,690
Hold up.

2234
02:19:21,830 --> 02:19:24,830
I guess the only thing that you could say is...

2235
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:28,790
The only one you could argue against is MGS1, but come on.

2236
02:19:28,930 --> 02:19:34,070
I would still argue for it.

2237
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:37,350
All things considered.

2238
02:19:37,630 --> 02:19:39,310
How do I use the ration?

2239
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,690
Press OK button.

2240
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:44,230
There we go.

2241
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:50,540
I

2242
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:56,810
don't know what that was!

2243
02:19:57,230 --> 02:20:03,270
I don't know what that was!

2244
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:05,130
Windows!

2245
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:08,110
You're scaring me.

2246
02:20:08,290 --> 02:20:11,250
I wish there was a first person view.

2247
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:13,710
Sometimes in this game at least.

2248
02:20:14,710 --> 02:20:18,910
I know that there is one if I use the solid eye, but...

2249
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,010
It doesn't feel quite the same.

2250
02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:23,950
OK.

2251
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:25,210
Oh, here we go.

2252
02:20:25,530 --> 02:20:26,610
I think that's another ration.

2253
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:36,320
Okey dokey.

2254
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:37,040
Onwards.

2255
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:48,530
I hear flies.

2256
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:50,970
I hear bugs.

2257
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:53,050
Smelly stinky.

2258
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:57,250
We're outside again.

2259
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:59,790
Alright, this way.

2260
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:05,830
I see another one, so I'm going to send out Mark 2 again.

2261
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,350
Follow the rat.

2262
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:09,170
No!

2263
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:09,270
No!

2264
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:13,530
Sorry.

2265
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:14,850
What the hell?

2266
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:20,550
Slow, steady, grab.

2267
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:23,750
Nice.

2268
02:21:26,130 --> 02:21:26,690
Actually...

2269
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:33,230
Hello?

2270
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:38,970
Hello?

2271
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:42,170
This is... What?

2272
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:45,510
How far can he go though?

2273
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:47,170
I don't want him to get out of range.

2274
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,440
I got... What was that?

2275
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:04,320
I don't know what that was.

2276
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:05,900
I think it was maybe a book?

2277
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:15,540
So crazy!

2278
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:26,550
Are we going to see a girl working out?

2279
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,990
That would be so funny.

2280
02:22:31,810 --> 02:22:32,910
Alright, come back to me.

2281
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:38,590
We can't, we can't... Or can we crawl through here?

2282
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:41,190
I guess we can.

2283
02:22:41,390 --> 02:22:42,650
We are big enough for it.

2284
02:22:43,090 --> 02:22:44,150
That's fine, we went through.

2285
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:49,810
We went through, we're fine.

2286
02:22:57,230 --> 02:22:58,110
Any bombs?

2287
02:22:58,430 --> 02:22:58,670
Nope.

2288
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:02,530
I'm sneaking, but my cheek claps alert the guards.

2289
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:04,830
That's...

2290
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:08,950
Is that a bomb?

2291
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:17,090
This view makes me think of that one crawling ghost from Fatal Frame 3.

2292
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:25,880
Ok.

2293
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:31,160
God, Snake, stop being so lazy, you lazy pants.

2294
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,560
I got so much noodle.

2295
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:35,500
We're getting so much stuff.

2296
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:36,060
This is crazy.

2297
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:51,450
Here we are!

2298
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:55,730
Rat Patrol!

2299
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:19,910
No spoilers you guys.

2300
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:20,670
Come on, come on.

2301
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:21,850
Let him introduce himself.

2302
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:23,530
Let him introduce himself.

2303
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:35,430
I like the Foxhound patch.

2304
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:46,830
Ok,

2305
02:24:51,170 --> 02:24:52,090
now we know who it is.

2306
02:24:52,430 --> 02:24:52,930
Johnny!

2307
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:02,050
Holy, my ears.

2308
02:25:02,570 --> 02:25:03,190
My goodness.

2309
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:10,430
A lady!

2310
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:13,450
Bald guys!

2311
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:21,650
What are you trying to say, madam?

2312
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:26,050
Oh my god!

2313
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:28,750
Oh my god, get off of him!

2314
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:34,270
The knee is the weapon.

2315
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:38,130
I wouldn't try anything funny if I were you.

2316
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:41,890
Oh no, she's hot.

2317
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:42,670
Fox.

2318
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:54,550
Miss Meryl!

2319
02:25:57,530 --> 02:25:58,750
She lived!

2320
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:02,090
She lived after...

2321
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:04,710
After even I killed her.

2322
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:05,070
Nope.

2323
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:11,450
That's so rude.

2324
02:26:11,450 --> 02:26:11,510
Yeah.

2325
02:26:35,390 --> 02:26:37,870
Does she still wiggle while she walks?

2326
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:38,450
Absolutely.

2327
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:42,470
And why do you still have your guns up?

2328
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:47,290
Do you literally not just see us having a friendly conversation?

2329
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:14,910
You can have this back.

2330
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:21,790
Johnny, our little Himbo shitter.

2331
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:25,450
What's wrong with you?

2332
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:26,350
Go away.

2333
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:27,210
Just leave.

2334
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:33,930
Get

2335
02:27:37,410 --> 02:27:43,530
out of here Snake before...

2336
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:45,190
Before the explosion!

2337
02:27:48,470 --> 02:27:49,450
Jeez, Johnny.

2338
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:52,530
Just like my cat.

2339
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:00,870
Liquid.

2340
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:06,370
A woman?

2341
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:10,090
Who is that?

2342
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:21,250
Oh, we have bad eyesight because we're old.

2343
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:26,410
Nevermind.

2344
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:36,170
He's such a grumpy old fart now.

2345
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,090
Oh.

2346
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:03,090
That's such a stupid...

2347
02:29:05,730 --> 02:29:06,790
Oh buddy.

2348
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:08,210
Johnny.

2349
02:29:10,210 --> 02:29:12,290
Why do they call him Akiba though?

2350
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:18,930
Get this guy some Pepto.

2351
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:22,990
Okay, Akiba.

2352
02:29:24,930 --> 02:29:26,250
She's so dumb with him.

2353
02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:28,250
Oh boy.

2354
02:29:37,870 --> 02:29:37,890
No.

2355
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:06,670
Wow.

2356
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:21,830
Snake at this age, with this look, is what I feel Gen Z actually thinks 40 year olds look like.

2357
02:30:22,810 --> 02:30:23,590
Because what?

2358
02:30:23,790 --> 02:30:25,310
Meryl would be like mid-20s.

2359
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:25,910
No, sorry.

2360
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:27,430
They're about 30s now.

2361
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,830
Early 30s.

2362
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:42,570
Not wrong.

2363
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:46,610
Snake is late 30s.

2364
02:30:48,070 --> 02:30:50,830
He was about 31?

2365
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:53,690
In...

2366
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:58,030
Shadow Moses.

2367
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:07,330
Meryl is 25 years.

2368
02:31:09,370 --> 02:31:10,670
27?

2369
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:14,930
25, 27?

2370
02:31:14,930 --> 02:31:17,930
Oh my god, she was 18 in...

2371
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:23,850
Here, we'll watch the cutscene first.

2372
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:27,190
She was like 18 in Shadow Moses.

2373
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:35,730
Not dumb.

2374
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:39,270
That's crazy.

2375
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:41,050
Sweat?

2376
02:32:00,290 --> 02:32:01,690
Crazy.

2377
02:32:13,490 --> 02:32:14,890
Crazy.

2378
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:20,630
Okay.

2379
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:23,170
They're gonna know when you're dorking it.

2380
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:25,150
How much sweat do you sweat?

2381
02:32:32,770 --> 02:32:35,990
Is that Meryl at the top?

2382
02:32:37,150 --> 02:32:38,590
Why does her face look like that?

2383
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:42,530
They did her so dirty with this picture.

2384
02:32:45,270 --> 02:32:46,310
What the hell?

2385
02:32:51,450 --> 02:32:55,370
It's like some guy put a wig on and said he's Meryl.

2386
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:01,710
No way.

2387
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:10,810
Meryl was sick that day so Johnny put on a wig and said it's him.

2388
02:33:14,930 --> 02:33:15,710
A commodity.

2389
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:36,230
I think Minto and Johnny are made for each other.

2390
02:33:42,050 --> 02:33:44,010
I don't hate Johnny.

2391
02:33:46,110 --> 02:33:50,110
Johnny is proof that you can shit your pants and somebody will still love you.

2392
02:33:50,650 --> 02:33:52,030
Johnny should give us all hope.

2393
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:53,950
And finding love.

2394
02:33:58,350 --> 02:33:59,210
He's our IPS King.

2395
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:01,210
Yeah.

2396
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:19,930
SOP.

2397
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:28,930
She says la li lu le lo.

2398
02:34:28,930 --> 02:34:29,710
Really?

2399
02:34:45,890 --> 02:34:47,630
Johnny appeals me too much.

2400
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:07,310
There he is.

2401
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:08,110
There he is.

2402
02:35:12,570 --> 02:35:15,270
Army special operations.

2403
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:16,870
What was the last one?

2404
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:28,410
Command?

2405
02:35:30,090 --> 02:35:32,130
Thank you.

2406
02:35:47,470 --> 02:35:48,530
No.

2407
02:35:53,910 --> 02:35:55,950
Such a big heart.

2408
02:35:56,730 --> 02:35:58,930
Johnny looks the same.

2409
02:35:59,610 --> 02:36:01,630
I think it's Evan Obey.

2410
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:21,050
I think she was absent that day.

2411
02:36:49,290 --> 02:36:49,770
Yeah!

2412
02:36:49,950 --> 02:36:50,750
Break stuff!

2413
02:36:51,570 --> 02:36:53,070
Give me something to break!

2414
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:09,970
Some nanomachines kicking in good baby.

2415
02:37:34,050 --> 02:37:35,670
Why are you still calling him uncle?

2416
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:37,490
You're still calling him Colonel.

2417
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:38,710
He's your father.

2418
02:37:39,090 --> 02:37:41,570
As far as I'm concerned, we're still uncle and niece.

2419
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:45,210
I will never forgive that womanizing piece of shit.

2420
02:37:45,570 --> 02:37:48,530
He doesn't know.

2421
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:51,190
Yeah, Meryl is so cute in this game.

2422
02:37:51,630 --> 02:37:55,010
She looks like a young boss, you know?

2423
02:37:56,890 --> 02:37:58,750
His new wife's about my age.

2424
02:37:59,590 --> 02:38:01,310
I hear she's even got a kid.

2425
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:05,330
It's as if he's given up on making up with his own daughter.

2426
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,660
And men.

2427
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:11,600
Men!

2428
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:14,440
Selfish, egotistical pigs.

2429
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,800
You tell him!

2430
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:25,860
What is it?

2431
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,640
So good.

2432
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:27,680
Hmm.

2433
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:37,780
Uh-oh.

2434
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:39,660
Uh-oh!

2435
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:41,140
Oh no!

2436
02:38:41,300 --> 02:38:41,740
The frogs!

2437
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:45,660
These guys are serious business.

2438
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:47,380
Yeah.

2439
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:49,000
That's how I feel.

2440
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:51,020
Oh crap!

2441
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:53,620
Were you being followed?

2442
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,940
This frog is such an egotistical man.

2443
02:38:58,140 --> 02:38:58,540
True.

2444
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:04,580
Oh buddy!

2445
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:13,940
You just said so.

2446
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,400
You just claimed fault.

2447
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:17,660
Nobody thought so until you said it.

2448
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:21,340
Oh!

2449
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:22,200
Oh!

2450
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,320
No!

2451
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:26,160
It wasn't my fault!

2452
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:26,980
I swear!

2453
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:29,920
It wasn't my fault!

2454
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:31,160
Oh man!

2455
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:33,600
Look I...

2456
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:35,340
Dumbass!

2457
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:36,820
We're moving out!

2458
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:39,040
Meryl, where's Liquid?

2459
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:40,280
At a camp up ahead.

2460
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,660
He's so extreme.

2461
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:43,660
If we're still alive.

2462
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:45,220
Okay.

2463
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:46,700
Alright.

2464
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:49,980
I think I still have to be non-lethal here.

2465
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:51,000
The MacBook.

2466
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:55,990
Alright.

2467
02:39:56,930 --> 02:39:57,650
I think I do?

2468
02:39:57,830 --> 02:39:58,350
I'm not sure.

2469
02:39:59,790 --> 02:40:00,670
It does count?

2470
02:40:00,850 --> 02:40:00,930
Okay.

2471
02:40:07,930 --> 02:40:08,750
Oh gosh!

2472
02:40:08,890 --> 02:40:10,050
The frogs!

2473
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:18,940
Oh god!

2474
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:19,640
They're so cool.

2475
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:20,640
But they're so scary.

2476
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:21,720
But they're so cool.

2477
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,060
But they're so scary!

2478
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:27,480
Turning down the volume a little bit.

2479
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:35,300
Okay.

2480
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:39,660
Okay.

2481
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,300
Okay.

2482
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:44,220
Okay.

2483
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:52,560
A little anxious guy.

2484
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:53,560
Aww.

2485
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:53,760
Aww.

2486
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,000
Woman unit!

2487
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:06,560
Alright.

2488
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,340
I'm going with you guys.

2489
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:09,760
Why do I...

2490
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,340
No, no, no, no.

2491
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:10,700
Hold on.

2492
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:11,220
Hold on.

2493
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:17,280
Grenade?

2494
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:27,150
I'm not hiding at all.

2495
02:41:27,150 --> 02:41:29,450
I'm kind of like just way out in the open.

2496
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:30,730
Here they come.

2497
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:30,990
More?

2498
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:34,050
Where are they?

2499
02:41:35,230 --> 02:41:35,990
Oh, they're up here.

2500
02:41:41,390 --> 02:41:42,410
I'm putting them to sleep.

2501
02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:42,870
Don't worry.

2502
02:41:43,350 --> 02:41:44,710
They'll fall asleep in like two seconds.

2503
02:41:45,370 --> 02:41:46,630
I don't think I can...

2504
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:48,230
I don't think I can be non-lethal here.

2505
02:41:48,330 --> 02:41:48,910
God, they're good.

2506
02:41:50,050 --> 02:41:51,210
Okay, I took that one out.

2507
02:41:58,450 --> 02:41:59,110
Hell yeah.

2508
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,850
Money, money, baby.

2509
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:01,690
Money, money, baby.

2510
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:11,090
Wait, hold on.

2511
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:19,640
Because I'm trying to...

2512
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:22,460
So basically I'm trying to get the solar gun.

2513
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:25,300
And I can't remember...

2514
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:29,380
Yeah, Sunny is making eggs.

2515
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:33,300
I can't remember if I...

2516
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,900
Can do non-lethal here or not.

2517
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:44,320
I don't have it in my inventory because I never got it before.

2518
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:46,600
I don't think.

2519
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:52,840
Solar...

2520
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:55,080
Solar...

2521
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:56,580
Solar...

2522
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:57,720
Real gun.

2523
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,720
I don't have to be non-lethal the whole game.

2524
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:04,080
Yeah, I don't have it.

2525
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:06,780
I think this portion counts.

2526
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:08,720
I'm pretty sure this portion counts.

2527
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:13,740
Sorry guys, I should've read it again to confirm.

2528
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:17,960
I know it's like at least up until Meryl's...

2529
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:21,820
Up until you meet Meryl, but I'm not sure if it's this whole act or not.

2530
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:25,740
I think it's up until act 2 that I have to be non-lethal, so...

2531
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:27,920
Yeah, just letting you know.

2532
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:29,440
I'll just continue.

2533
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:34,040
I have to be at least.

2534
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:35,040
I don't think they have to.

2535
02:43:48,570 --> 02:43:50,230
Here we'll just...

2536
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:50,750
Where are they?

2537
02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:51,390
Oh, they're up there.

2538
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:53,810
Headshot!

2539
02:43:53,970 --> 02:43:54,470
Oh, damn.

2540
02:43:56,790 --> 02:43:57,530
Oh, god!

2541
02:43:58,990 --> 02:44:00,070
Scared the hell out of me.

2542
02:44:00,230 --> 02:44:01,270
I'm equipping my racket.

2543
02:44:03,870 --> 02:44:04,990
Ow, ow, stop!

2544
02:44:06,010 --> 02:44:06,790
I got you.

2545
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:07,710
I got you.

2546
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:11,710
Oh, ok, they're gone.

2547
02:44:12,830 --> 02:44:13,390
Where'd they go?

2548
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:14,250
Oh, you're over here?

2549
02:44:15,730 --> 02:44:16,530
From behind!

2550
02:44:19,170 --> 02:44:20,590
Oh, that's kind of crazy.

2551
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:22,830
I can't... I can't see.

2552
02:44:24,450 --> 02:44:26,070
When your big ass is in the way!

2553
02:44:27,690 --> 02:44:29,990
Oh, my god.

2554
02:44:30,090 --> 02:44:30,510
Oh, my god.

2555
02:44:32,130 --> 02:44:33,930
I totally hit you for sure.

2556
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:45,150
I'm going.

2557
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:46,470
I'm with you guys.

2558
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:47,150
I'm with you guys.

2559
02:44:47,510 --> 02:44:48,430
I'm with you guys.

2560
02:44:48,530 --> 02:44:49,130
I'm with you guys.

2561
02:44:49,650 --> 02:44:50,130
Move, Johnny.

2562
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:54,250
Oh, what did you give me?

2563
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:55,470
What did you give me, Johnny?

2564
02:44:55,610 --> 02:44:56,310
You're so sweet.

2565
02:44:57,270 --> 02:44:58,790
Oh, thank you.

2566
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:01,250
Excuse me.

2567
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:01,910
Excuse me.

2568
02:45:03,150 --> 02:45:03,790
Oh, my god.

2569
02:45:03,890 --> 02:45:04,350
Oh, my god.

2570
02:45:04,410 --> 02:45:04,810
Oh, my god.

2571
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:07,290
Grenade!

2572
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:13,250
I can't.

2573
02:45:13,250 --> 02:45:13,930
I can't.

2574
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:15,750
Freaking...

2575
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,950
Oh, my god.

2576
02:45:17,110 --> 02:45:18,050
Johnny, get out of the way.

2577
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:19,730
Oh, my god.

2578
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:20,050
No!

2579
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:21,670
I should have taken the shot.

2580
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:26,670
There's so many of them!

2581
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:27,570
Oh, my god.

2582
02:45:37,070 --> 02:45:37,790
Sleepy babies.

2583
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:38,610
Sleepy babies.

2584
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,620
Thanks, John.

2585
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:46,100
Can I pierce them?

2586
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:47,980
Everybody just said only do head shots.

2587
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:49,200
So that's why I figured I only can.

2588
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:51,860
I don't know if I can... Oh, shoot.

2589
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:52,520
Oh, my god.

2590
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:53,800
I can't remember how to... Oh, my god.

2591
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:55,220
Ouch.

2592
02:45:57,980 --> 02:46:00,040
Is it... Which button is it to look up?

2593
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:01,280
I don't wanna have to...

2594
02:46:04,220 --> 02:46:04,980
Body shot counts?

2595
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:05,440
Oh, okay.

2596
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:07,800
Well, he's gone now.

2597
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:10,360
I'm like doing nothing, but that's okay.

2598
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,040
Oops.

2599
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:13,860
I have to have good aim first.

2600
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:19,210
Where are you?

2601
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:20,430
Show up.

2602
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:21,610
I think I got them.

2603
02:46:24,990 --> 02:46:25,950
Oh, there they are.

2604
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:26,890
Hello.

2605
02:46:28,150 --> 02:46:28,870
I got them.

2606
02:46:29,510 --> 02:46:29,970
We're good.

2607
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:36,130
Yeah, I got them.

2608
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:36,910
We're good.

2609
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:38,630
Yeah, baby.

2610
02:46:40,190 --> 02:46:41,370
Why aren't we going forward?

2611
02:46:41,550 --> 02:46:42,450
I'm following you guys.

2612
02:46:43,150 --> 02:46:44,090
I'm following Meryl.

2613
02:46:44,530 --> 02:46:45,190
She's hotter.

2614
02:46:46,530 --> 02:46:47,050
Nevermind.

2615
02:46:47,250 --> 02:46:47,970
She went the wrong way.

2616
02:46:50,610 --> 02:46:51,290
Good job.

2617
02:46:52,630 --> 02:46:53,150
Clear.

2618
02:46:53,870 --> 02:46:54,850
Take their stuff.

2619
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:55,430
Take their stuff.

2620
02:46:55,430 --> 02:46:55,510
Take their stuff.

2621
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:57,270
Get some money.

2622
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:02,610
This is Splinter Cell.

2623
02:47:03,550 --> 02:47:04,430
Excuse me.

2624
02:47:09,810 --> 02:47:11,170
I too follow hot women.

2625
02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:12,890
Alright.

2626
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:14,570
Let's go, Meryl.

2627
02:47:15,730 --> 02:47:17,630
I know you're a stealth game fan.

2628
02:47:18,270 --> 02:47:19,370
Have you played Assassin's Creed?

2629
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:21,230
I have not played Assassin's Creed.

2630
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:23,690
I also don't like stealth games.

2631
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,750
Truthfully.

2632
02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:27,050
I'm just in the open.

2633
02:47:27,050 --> 02:47:27,550
What?

2634
02:47:27,630 --> 02:47:28,190
You want me to go?

2635
02:47:28,370 --> 02:47:28,750
Fine.

2636
02:47:29,310 --> 02:47:30,790
I'm sacrificing myself.

2637
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:37,050
She's sacrificing herself.

2638
02:47:37,530 --> 02:47:38,950
I can't see anything.

2639
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:41,810
Johnny, come on, buddy.

2640
02:47:42,330 --> 02:47:42,810
Come on.

2641
02:47:43,130 --> 02:47:44,070
Be strong, buddy.

2642
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:45,090
Be strong.

2643
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:47,370
I can't.

2644
02:47:49,170 --> 02:47:50,470
Be strong, buddy.

2645
02:47:50,970 --> 02:47:52,010
You got this.

2646
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:54,270
Why can't I see through the...

2647
02:47:54,270 --> 02:47:54,770
Oh my god.

2648
02:47:56,830 --> 02:47:57,250
Ugh.

2649
02:47:57,890 --> 02:47:58,250
Hold on.

2650
02:47:59,670 --> 02:48:00,850
I'm doing so...

2651
02:48:00,850 --> 02:48:01,990
I don't know why my...

2652
02:48:01,990 --> 02:48:02,510
There it is.

2653
02:48:02,850 --> 02:48:05,190
I think I had the auto-aim on and it was messing me up.

2654
02:48:08,130 --> 02:48:08,790
There we go.

2655
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:09,830
One down.

2656
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:18,780
They're arguing over there.

2657
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:20,700
I'm just not gonna listen to them.

2658
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:23,920
Why do I keep having auto-aim?

2659
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,620
Oh, I'm pressing square instead of circle.

2660
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:26,120
That's why.

2661
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:27,340
That's my bad.

2662
02:48:30,100 --> 02:48:30,940
Stop running!

2663
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:35,670
I think they're down.

2664
02:48:36,330 --> 02:48:37,270
And one over.

2665
02:48:38,930 --> 02:48:39,970
I got them.

2666
02:48:40,270 --> 02:48:41,210
I don't got them.

2667
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,270
Well, they'll fall asleep eventually.

2668
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:42,970
Probably.

2669
02:48:45,130 --> 02:48:46,470
Like a married couple.

2670
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:47,550
Truly.

2671
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:51,850
Where'd they go?

2672
02:48:52,470 --> 02:48:52,970
Where'd they go?

2673
02:48:54,330 --> 02:48:55,350
Oh, there they are.

2674
02:48:55,870 --> 02:48:56,350
Dang it.

2675
02:48:56,530 --> 02:48:57,050
Don't move.

2676
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:05,120
Are they shooting from down here?

2677
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,680
Oh, yes they are.

2678
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:07,540
Somewhere.

2679
02:49:08,300 --> 02:49:09,560
Don't hit me, okay?

2680
02:49:13,700 --> 02:49:14,580
They're like...

2681
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:15,080
Oh, damn.

2682
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:16,640
I thought I had them there.

2683
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:17,520
Oh, I got them.

2684
02:49:17,620 --> 02:49:18,280
I did get them.

2685
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:20,480
Slowly but surely.

2686
02:49:29,090 --> 02:49:30,530
We could just keep going.

2687
02:49:30,670 --> 02:49:31,250
I'm just saying.

2688
02:49:31,870 --> 02:49:34,990
If all we're trying to do is escape, I mean...

2689
02:49:35,630 --> 02:49:37,850
We could just keep walking...

2690
02:49:37,850 --> 02:49:39,310
It's on me!

2691
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:47,320
Did they all leave?

2692
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:49,540
Hey!

2693
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:51,140
Where'd everybody go?

2694
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:51,820
Oh my god.

2695
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:54,500
What the hell?

2696
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:57,510
You guys!

2697
02:50:04,090 --> 02:50:05,370
Oh, good job.

2698
02:50:06,390 --> 02:50:07,570
Is that Johnny?

2699
02:50:07,570 --> 02:50:07,650
Is that Johnny?

2700
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:18,050
I'm eating bullets.

2701
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:18,750
I'm eating bullets.

2702
02:50:20,090 --> 02:50:21,470
I'm eating bullets.

2703
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:29,580
Oh, that's awkward.

2704
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:30,180
Anyway.

2705
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:35,320
Anyway.

2706
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:38,940
You okay, Meryl?

2707
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:41,040
Nah, she's fine.

2708
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:44,780
You okay too?

2709
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:52,420
Everybody's hiding in corners.

2710
02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:53,340
What's going on?

2711
02:50:55,660 --> 02:50:57,340
Oh yeah, we can CQC.

2712
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:58,200
What was that again?

2713
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:00,760
Hold on, I got this.

2714
02:51:21,130 --> 02:51:21,970
Yeah, you're welcome.

2715
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:24,790
Stop pushing me!

2716
02:51:25,230 --> 02:51:26,410
Stop hitting me!

2717
02:51:29,710 --> 02:51:30,270
Yeah.

2718
02:51:30,270 --> 02:51:30,370
Yeah.

2719
02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:34,830
Holy!

2720
02:51:40,150 --> 02:51:40,790
Roll out!

2721
02:51:51,490 --> 02:51:54,130
MGSV really cleans up the hand to hand combat.

2722
02:51:58,610 --> 02:51:59,970
Oh my god.

2723
02:52:00,270 --> 02:52:00,550
Johnny.

2724
02:52:02,110 --> 02:52:03,230
Oh, Johnny.

2725
02:52:03,450 --> 02:52:04,330
Oh, Johnny.

2726
02:52:05,710 --> 02:52:06,990
Oh, Johnny.

2727
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:09,970
Oh, Johnny.

2728
02:52:11,950 --> 02:52:12,750
Oh, Johnny.

2729
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:13,510
Oh, Johnny.

2730
02:52:20,090 --> 02:52:20,730
Nice.

2731
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:34,570
Nice.

2732
02:52:35,770 --> 02:52:37,730
I'm just gonna grab some stuff real quick.

2733
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:39,370
Oh my god.

2734
02:52:42,510 --> 02:52:43,090
Okay.

2735
02:52:46,010 --> 02:52:47,190
Anything else in here?

2736
02:52:48,850 --> 02:52:49,730
Thank goodness.

2737
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:51,730
That was not a...

2738
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:54,510
Okay, this way.

2739
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:55,730
Wait, what's in here?

2740
02:52:57,010 --> 02:52:58,150
There's more stuff.

2741
02:52:58,790 --> 02:53:00,490
White phosphorus grenade?

2742
02:53:01,550 --> 02:53:02,870
Ready grenade with L1 button.

2743
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:05,110
Well, we won't need it right now.

2744
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:07,090
But, crazy.

2745
02:53:07,470 --> 02:53:08,190
And more noodles.

2746
02:53:09,310 --> 02:53:10,190
Alright, everybody good?

2747
02:53:15,270 --> 02:53:16,370
That's not really good.

2748
02:53:17,110 --> 02:53:18,350
I think we should leave.

2749
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:21,350
It's like this door over here, right?

2750
02:53:22,010 --> 02:53:22,630
Oh my god.

2751
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:23,750
All we gotta do is run.

2752
02:53:24,630 --> 02:53:26,030
All we gotta do is just go.

2753
02:53:26,690 --> 02:53:27,010
Bye!

2754
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:30,670
Everybody escape.

2755
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:32,330
Everybody leave.

2756
02:53:32,330 --> 02:53:33,310
No?

2757
02:53:33,550 --> 02:53:33,810
Okay.

2758
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,430
Just me?

2759
02:53:36,210 --> 02:53:36,450
Alright.

2760
02:53:41,390 --> 02:53:42,750
For someone who loves these...

2761
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:44,910
Emotionally charged messy drama...

2762
02:53:44,910 --> 02:53:46,390
Between men who are definitely straight...

2763
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:47,790
You may enjoy Yakuza 0.

2764
02:53:49,130 --> 02:53:49,970
I know.

2765
02:53:50,070 --> 02:53:51,510
Everybody tells me to play Yakuza.

2766
02:53:52,210 --> 02:53:54,010
Everybody telling me to play Yakuza.

2767
02:53:57,150 --> 02:53:58,410
Oh, they're down.

2768
02:53:58,970 --> 02:53:59,170
Wait.

2769
02:53:59,890 --> 02:54:00,670
I got him.

2770
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:02,210
I am.

2771
02:54:02,450 --> 02:54:02,870
I'm fine.

2772
02:54:03,830 --> 02:54:04,510
You're welcome.

2773
02:54:09,770 --> 02:54:10,890
Behind me?

2774
02:54:11,090 --> 02:54:11,470
Where?

2775
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:18,640
You are actually...

2776
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:22,180
You're actually throwing off my game.

2777
02:54:23,880 --> 02:54:24,440
Meryl!

2778
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:32,690
Oh, I just realized that my line of sight is...

2779
02:54:32,690 --> 02:54:33,670
I'm a dummy-dumb.

2780
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:34,770
I'm a dummy head.

2781
02:54:36,470 --> 02:54:37,250
Close enough.

2782
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:37,690
There we go.

2783
02:54:37,690 --> 02:54:39,470
Actually, close for real.

2784
02:54:40,390 --> 02:54:41,510
Elder abuse.

2785
02:54:44,170 --> 02:54:48,670
See, this is where I went from the beginning...

2786
02:54:48,670 --> 02:54:49,510
and nobody listened to me.

2787
02:54:50,410 --> 02:54:51,470
Oh gosh.

2788
02:54:52,830 --> 02:54:54,190
Shooting the wall for real.

2789
02:54:57,870 --> 02:54:59,690
Meryl just pushed me out of the way.

2790
02:55:01,930 --> 02:55:03,330
I wonder literally...

2791
02:55:03,330 --> 02:55:05,310
I wonder actually how many I took down...

2792
02:55:05,310 --> 02:55:07,330
compared to how many they took down.

2793
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:13,230
The frog doll.

2794
02:55:13,850 --> 02:55:14,730
Oh wait.

2795
02:55:15,830 --> 02:55:17,110
I guess not.

2796
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:20,050
I need that for the...

2797
02:55:20,410 --> 02:55:21,190
gun, don't I?

2798
02:55:21,670 --> 02:55:22,650
Did I mess up already?

2799
02:55:24,410 --> 02:55:25,770
Did I already mess up?

2800
02:55:25,950 --> 02:55:27,610
If I did...

2801
02:55:27,610 --> 02:55:29,430
I think we're about to hit...

2802
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:33,050
I think we're about to hit Act 2.

2803
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:36,450
So...

2804
02:55:36,930 --> 02:55:37,970
If I messed up...

2805
02:55:37,970 --> 02:55:39,110
I can just play it off stream.

2806
02:55:39,350 --> 02:55:40,570
Redo the mission off stream.

2807
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:49,660
If it's there in the garage...

2808
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:50,500
you did it non-lethally.

2809
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:51,480
Oh, in here.

2810
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:51,760
Wait.

2811
02:55:52,320 --> 02:55:55,720
In the garage, not...

2812
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:57,320
So, in here.

2813
02:56:00,450 --> 02:56:01,550
Because this is the garage...

2814
02:56:01,550 --> 02:56:02,050
coming up, right?

2815
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:04,630
Wait, why am I suddenly with my M4?

2816
02:56:05,490 --> 02:56:06,890
It's trying to sabotage me.

2817
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:12,080
Yeah, down the elevator...

2818
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:13,220
they go into the car garage.

2819
02:56:14,460 --> 02:56:18,260
I know what that means.

2820
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:20,400
Okay, yeah.

2821
02:56:21,540 --> 02:56:22,540
Gotta pay attention.

2822
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:23,580
Yeah.

2823
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:24,840
Okay.

2824
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:31,120
Meryl Abadie.

2825
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:31,660
I know.

2826
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:33,600
She's so cool in this game.

2827
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:40,400
Everybody becomes so cool...

2828
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:41,500
in this game, except Snake.

2829
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:43,400
But she's always cool.

2830
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,320
But you know what I mean.

2831
02:56:47,320 --> 02:56:49,740
I think you should actually check.

2832
02:56:49,980 --> 02:56:50,820
What do you mean?

2833
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:56,720
You didn't look behind any of the cars.

2834
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,400
You just took two glances around...

2835
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:01,260
and said it was fine.

2836
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:10,260
So cool.

2837
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:12,040
Snake is like...

2838
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:13,280
I'm not needed here anymore.

2839
02:57:29,830 --> 02:57:31,450
A little overkill, huh?

2840
02:57:31,710 --> 02:57:32,970
Don't you think, buddy?

2841
02:57:33,870 --> 02:57:36,290
I thought the nanomachines were supposed to calm your anger.

2842
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:47,670
Pain.

2843
02:57:55,090 --> 02:57:56,270
Lily.

2844
02:57:58,290 --> 02:57:59,990
My team kill Lily.

2845
02:58:18,490 --> 02:58:21,270
He said the line.

2846
02:58:26,490 --> 02:58:27,250
But...

2847
02:58:27,250 --> 02:58:28,490
Your body...

2848
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:30,930
Are you gonna be alright?

2849
02:58:40,610 --> 02:58:42,210
Liquid's camp is up ahead.

2850
02:58:43,150 --> 02:58:44,170
I'll mark it on your map.

2851
02:58:44,610 --> 02:58:45,030
Thanks.

2852
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:48,930
It's so painful.

2853
02:58:49,630 --> 02:58:52,130
When old Snake's theme starts playing...

2854
02:58:52,130 --> 02:58:53,710
my heart just...

2855
02:58:58,380 --> 02:58:59,280
Akiba.

2856
02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:04,120
One man's blunder...

2857
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:05,480
can compromise the whole team.

2858
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:07,460
I'm sorry, Commander.

2859
02:59:10,300 --> 02:59:11,080
That's Bozo.

2860
02:59:14,800 --> 02:59:16,600
You know...

2861
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:18,520
You know...

2862
02:59:18,520 --> 02:59:20,300
He is grinning ear to ear...

2863
02:59:20,300 --> 02:59:21,100
behind that mask.

2864
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:25,800
You know my man...

2865
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:26,880
is glowing behind...

2866
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:29,160
He is just like...

2867
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:37,800
Oh my God.

2868
02:59:41,960 --> 02:59:44,100
Yeah, he is teasing.

2869
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:46,880
He is just like...

2870
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:48,560
Otacon.

2871
02:59:50,560 --> 02:59:51,960
Otacon.

2872
02:59:58,380 --> 02:59:59,200
Okay.

2873
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:03,580
Hotter.

2874
03:00:18,560 --> 03:00:20,080
It's true.

2875
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:38,220
Thanks Big Boss.

2876
03:00:49,420 --> 03:00:50,060
Thanks.

2877
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:05,040
That geek kid.

2878
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,140
Yeah, get with the times old man.

2879
03:01:25,670 --> 03:01:26,010
Ah...

2880
03:01:26,530 --> 03:01:29,810
Get with the times old man, but...

2881
03:01:30,710 --> 03:01:32,110
Look for the doll.

2882
03:01:32,610 --> 03:01:33,430
Let's see.

2883
03:01:34,450 --> 03:01:34,970
Let's see.

2884
03:01:43,630 --> 03:01:47,290
An action figure of one of Liquid's personal frog soldiers.

2885
03:01:47,650 --> 03:01:50,010
This rare item can only be found in the Middle East.

2886
03:01:50,370 --> 03:01:52,370
This makes a great gift for Sunny.

2887
03:01:52,370 --> 03:01:53,370
Nice!

2888
03:01:53,730 --> 03:01:54,650
I got it!

2889
03:01:57,030 --> 03:01:57,590
Yippee!

2890
03:01:59,170 --> 03:02:00,950
Alright, alright, alright.

2891
03:02:01,470 --> 03:02:02,410
Nice, nice, nice.

2892
03:02:02,950 --> 03:02:05,370
Alright, so we gotta get to the...

2893
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:10,130
We got... How much DP do I have now?

2894
03:02:10,230 --> 03:02:10,870
I'm just curious.

2895
03:02:11,030 --> 03:02:12,550
Not so much.

2896
03:02:14,190 --> 03:02:15,870
Hold on, let me...

2897
03:02:15,870 --> 03:02:17,310
I think it was about here.

2898
03:02:17,450 --> 03:02:18,130
I don't remember.

2899
03:02:18,130 --> 03:02:19,730
I'll adjust.

2900
03:02:19,830 --> 03:02:21,090
I'll adjust as the stream goes.

2901
03:02:22,370 --> 03:02:22,970
Dang.

2902
03:02:23,470 --> 03:02:25,570
I think I started with...

2903
03:02:25,570 --> 03:02:26,690
200 ,000 and I barely...

2904
03:02:27,390 --> 03:02:28,590
210k to 230.

2905
03:02:30,770 --> 03:02:33,310
Guys, it's gonna take a lot to get to...

2906
03:02:34,430 --> 03:02:36,130
To 5 million!

2907
03:02:40,410 --> 03:02:42,310
That one gun is 1 million.

2908
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:44,130
Yeah, this one's 5 million!

2909
03:02:45,730 --> 03:02:48,730
I might need to do some grinding off stream.

2910
03:02:53,070 --> 03:02:55,510
I might have to do some extreme grinding.

2911
03:02:58,130 --> 03:03:01,050
What if I just play the game all over again...

2912
03:03:01,050 --> 03:03:03,650
and then catch up to where I am...

2913
03:03:03,650 --> 03:03:05,390
with the new NUGA game plus.

2914
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:09,550
And then I'll definitely have enough.

2915
03:03:10,670 --> 03:03:11,230
Probably.

2916
03:03:19,220 --> 03:03:20,180
Where is it?

2917
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:20,640
Here?

2918
03:03:22,380 --> 03:03:22,940
Here?

2919
03:03:22,940 --> 03:03:24,960
Not that way.

2920
03:03:31,330 --> 03:03:32,330
These

2921
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:39,020
are friends.

2922
03:03:44,270 --> 03:03:47,910
Now, I don't have to be non-lethal anymore.

2923
03:03:48,670 --> 03:03:50,390
Except for...

2924
03:03:50,990 --> 03:03:52,230
the...

2925
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:53,590
the bosses.

2926
03:03:54,030 --> 03:03:54,770
The boss babes.

2927
03:03:55,690 --> 03:03:56,690
And then I'll be good.

2928
03:03:58,990 --> 03:03:59,490
Actually...

2929
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:02,170
I thought I...

2930
03:04:02,170 --> 03:04:03,630
Actually...

2931
03:04:03,630 --> 03:04:06,990
I think there's only one I did non-lethally.

2932
03:04:07,230 --> 03:04:08,390
Or rather, lethally.

2933
03:04:09,590 --> 03:04:11,630
I think I did raven...

2934
03:04:13,830 --> 03:04:14,330
lethal.

2935
03:04:14,950 --> 03:04:15,610
Oh, thank you.

2936
03:04:15,690 --> 03:04:16,450
Yeah, I should save.

2937
03:04:17,650 --> 03:04:19,830
I should save since we got the frog.

2938
03:04:28,770 --> 03:04:30,870
Do the masks count as the dolls?

2939
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:31,090
Dolls?

2940
03:04:38,030 --> 03:04:38,610
No.

2941
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:42,650
You can check your figure collection in briefing.

2942
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:54,260
Special actions?

2943
03:04:56,540 --> 03:04:57,940
I don't see it in here.

2944
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:05,950
I'll look it up after...

2945
03:05:07,010 --> 03:05:08,190
after stream.

2946
03:05:10,770 --> 03:05:15,490
Now I don't have to be non-lethal.

2947
03:05:15,610 --> 03:05:16,950
I can use my operator at least.

2948
03:05:18,770 --> 03:05:20,750
Oh, in between acts.

2949
03:05:20,930 --> 03:05:21,710
OK, OK.

2950
03:05:22,110 --> 03:05:26,990
I think we are close-ish to the end of...

2951
03:05:28,790 --> 03:05:30,090
This is a cutscene.

2952
03:05:30,290 --> 03:05:30,690
Oh my god.

2953
03:05:30,690 --> 03:05:30,750
Oh my god.

2954
03:05:35,240 --> 03:05:36,080
Oh my

2955
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:47,760
friends.

2956
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,180
My friends taking over the area.

2957
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:51,040
Nevermind.

2958
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:52,820
You good?

2959
03:05:53,260 --> 03:05:54,140
Gonna take your stuff?

2960
03:05:58,650 --> 03:06:00,010
Go, go, go!

2961
03:06:00,110 --> 03:06:00,730
Taking your stuff?

2962
03:06:05,830 --> 03:06:07,050
Yeah, I got your back.

2963
03:06:08,350 --> 03:06:09,590
Where do I go though?

2964
03:06:13,130 --> 03:06:13,770
That's alright.

2965
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:25,020
I'm going to... I don't think we need it so much right now.

2966
03:06:25,900 --> 03:06:28,480
I don't wanna get caught-caught, you know what I mean?

2967
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:30,920
So I'm gonna put on this.

2968
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:32,920
I don't wanna cause an alert.

2969
03:06:33,520 --> 03:06:35,800
Because they are so dang annoying when you do that.

2970
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:37,200
Hello.

2971
03:06:37,940 --> 03:06:38,780
Hello, goodbye.

2972
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:40,800
Can I get him?

2973
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:41,340
I don't know.

2974
03:06:42,880 --> 03:06:43,680
Nice work.

2975
03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:44,040
You're welcome.

2976
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:47,780
I like that they praise me every time I...

2977
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,940
Forget the rifles, they're useless.

2978
03:06:51,540 --> 03:06:54,340
Oh my god, buddy, buddy, I almost shot you.

2979
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,080
For real.

2980
03:07:01,050 --> 03:07:01,910
You're welcome.

2981
03:07:02,890 --> 03:07:06,390
God, this guy is... This guy has no instincts at all.

2982
03:07:06,710 --> 03:07:09,770
This guy has no instincts, no survival instincts whatsoever.

2983
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,350
Holy moly.

2984
03:07:13,230 --> 03:07:15,070
He is just...

2985
03:07:15,690 --> 03:07:16,250
Yeah.

2986
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:22,320
Reload him.

2987
03:07:22,940 --> 03:07:24,860
That's how you do it.

2988
03:07:26,400 --> 03:07:27,040
You're welcome.

2989
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:33,100
Oh my god, they're right there.

2990
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:34,220
Oh my god, they're scaring me.

2991
03:07:35,500 --> 03:07:36,220
You're welcome.

2992
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:39,300
Watch your back, maybe?

2993
03:07:41,480 --> 03:07:42,800
Oh my god.

2994
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:44,440
Why did you do that?

2995
03:07:45,080 --> 03:07:46,320
Why did you do that?

2996
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:49,680
What a dumbass.

2997
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:52,260
Oh my god.

2998
03:07:52,920 --> 03:07:54,680
Oh my god, I'm trying to...

2999
03:07:55,580 --> 03:07:56,740
I swear to god.

3000
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:00,280
I swear to god.

3001
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:07,100
Where are we aiming?

3002
03:08:07,460 --> 03:08:08,040
Where are we shooting?

3003
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:14,460
This guy right there?

3004
03:08:14,460 --> 03:08:14,840
Oh.

3005
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:23,580
Oh, I only shot off his helmet.

3006
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:30,880
Yeah, I don't have to be non-lethal anymore.

3007
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:36,740
I think you're good.

3008
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:38,680
I think your guys are good.

3009
03:08:47,880 --> 03:08:48,800
Anybody back here?

3010
03:08:48,980 --> 03:08:49,000
No?

3011
03:08:55,030 --> 03:08:56,030
I'm going up, baby.

3012
03:08:59,390 --> 03:09:00,790
Sorrow is always watching.

3013
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:12,680
Thank you.

3014
03:09:14,800 --> 03:09:15,740
I'll put you to sleep.

3015
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:17,300
I didn't know.

3016
03:09:17,340 --> 03:09:18,060
I thought you were dead.

3017
03:09:19,380 --> 03:09:20,640
Anyway, good night.

3018
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:24,140
Are you asleep?

3019
03:09:24,340 --> 03:09:24,820
Oh there he is.

3020
03:09:29,750 --> 03:09:31,350
What else is around here?

3021
03:09:32,430 --> 03:09:33,210
What else can we grab?

3022
03:09:33,310 --> 03:09:34,550
A missile launcher?

3023
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:35,930
Or a javelin?

3024
03:09:38,590 --> 03:09:39,170
Good night.

3025
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:40,790
Good night.

3026
03:09:43,210 --> 03:09:47,310
We gotta stop crouch walking so much or Snake is gonna get angry at me.

3027
03:09:48,930 --> 03:09:50,550
He's gonna go...

3028
03:09:56,660 --> 03:09:57,760
Oh that's my buddy.

3029
03:09:58,680 --> 03:09:59,220
Hey buddy.

3030
03:10:01,940 --> 03:10:04,720
Good thing I said buddy or else that guy would have been donezo.

3031
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:07,420
His old, old aching back.

3032
03:10:08,140 --> 03:10:09,200
Ok, I can't go through there.

3033
03:10:14,300 --> 03:10:15,260
My goodness.

3034
03:10:18,180 --> 03:10:19,340
Hello buddies.

3035
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:24,680
Where is my operator?

3036
03:10:25,880 --> 03:10:27,040
Smooth operator.

3037
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:29,360
Smooth operator.

3038
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:36,950
You're welcome.

3039
03:10:45,770 --> 03:10:48,110
We did it!

3040
03:10:49,010 --> 03:10:52,920
Take their weapons!

3041
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:55,660
I'm helping you out.

3042
03:10:55,700 --> 03:10:56,400
What are you talking about?

3043
03:10:58,180 --> 03:10:59,940
Don't act like you don't know who I am.

3044
03:11:00,040 --> 03:11:01,880
I literally shot all these guys for you.

3045
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:03,800
We did it!

3046
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:08,800
But...

3047
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:09,900
I know something.

3048
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:11,080
I'm grabbing their money.

3049
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:15,200
I'm grabbing their money.

3050
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:16,400
I think that's it.

3051
03:11:18,080 --> 03:11:19,100
Everybody's chill now.

3052
03:11:19,320 --> 03:11:20,680
The roosters are clucking.

3053
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:22,020
Everything's good.

3054
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:30,160
Yeah, I do know I can trade food and rations and stuff with them.

3055
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:41,870
Alright, cutscene.

3056
03:11:46,450 --> 03:11:48,290
I think it's because I'm used to it now.

3057
03:11:48,350 --> 03:11:50,650
Because I had to do it all until this time.

3058
03:11:52,550 --> 03:11:54,410
It automatically sells the guns.

3059
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:55,490
I'm pretty sure.

3060
03:12:04,310 --> 03:12:04,990
Move!

3061
03:12:14,370 --> 03:12:16,270
You don't need to be so sneaky, Snake.

3062
03:12:16,330 --> 03:12:16,650
It's OK.

3063
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:19,230
They love us.

3064
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:24,410
That's weird.

3065
03:12:25,990 --> 03:12:26,670
That...

3066
03:12:27,650 --> 03:12:29,710
That's... Why is it doing that?

3067
03:12:30,670 --> 03:12:31,690
That's not good.

3068
03:12:36,690 --> 03:12:37,930
That's not good.

3069
03:12:53,350 --> 03:12:55,010
The dog is laughing.

3070
03:12:55,950 --> 03:12:56,510
Crying.

3071
03:13:12,300 --> 03:13:13,700
God

3072
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:21,050
damn, girl.

3073
03:13:23,410 --> 03:13:25,130
I would leave.

3074
03:13:25,630 --> 03:13:26,710
I wouldn't...

3075
03:13:29,130 --> 03:13:30,450
That's awesome!

3076
03:13:34,430 --> 03:13:35,630
Laughing octopus.

3077
03:13:35,630 --> 03:13:35,970
Octopus.

3078
03:13:41,450 --> 03:13:42,570
What's the other one?

3079
03:13:42,770 --> 03:13:43,110
Wolf?

3080
03:13:44,090 --> 03:13:44,970
Crying wolf?

3081
03:13:45,450 --> 03:13:46,590
Or I can't remember.

3082
03:14:02,420 --> 03:14:04,300
Oh my god.

3083
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:05,780
Can't be.

3084
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:11,460
Oh my god.

3085
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:11,920
Ah!

3086
03:14:18,370 --> 03:14:26,010
Love that laughing octopus incorporates Solidus' little tentacles.

3087
03:14:26,710 --> 03:14:28,830
And then...

3088
03:14:28,830 --> 03:14:30,790
Oh my god, they're just...

3089
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:33,810
Their designs are so good.

3090
03:14:34,130 --> 03:14:34,910
So good.

3091
03:14:36,870 --> 03:14:37,250
No!

3092
03:14:37,610 --> 03:14:38,470
My friends!

3093
03:14:50,730 --> 03:14:52,990
The framerate.

3094
03:15:09,240 --> 03:15:12,200
No, but the PS3 can...

3095
03:15:12,200 --> 03:15:16,360
Me every day.

3096
03:15:26,370 --> 03:15:28,250
So cool.

3097
03:15:29,470 --> 03:15:30,750
So cool!

3098
03:15:31,070 --> 03:15:32,690
Oh my gosh.

3099
03:15:35,490 --> 03:15:36,310
They're so cool.

3100
03:15:37,890 --> 03:15:39,010
I love the beauties.

3101
03:15:42,450 --> 03:15:44,150
I love our boss babes.

3102
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:47,670
All our friends are dead.

3103
03:15:48,910 --> 03:15:50,630
No, our friends!

3104
03:15:57,030 --> 03:15:58,530
No, no, our friends!

3105
03:16:18,720 --> 03:16:20,080
Let's take...

3106
03:16:21,020 --> 03:16:22,300
Their money.

3107
03:16:26,980 --> 03:16:28,880
Aren't there guys now wandering around?

3108
03:16:28,980 --> 03:16:29,460
I don't remember.

3109
03:16:29,580 --> 03:16:30,820
Actually, I'm pretty sure there are.

3110
03:16:32,780 --> 03:16:36,080
But I can still grab all of this.

3111
03:16:38,100 --> 03:16:40,900
Maybe make a chunk of change.

3112
03:16:44,480 --> 03:16:46,020
Okay, thanks Otacon!

3113
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:46,300
Otacon!

3114
03:16:49,560 --> 03:16:51,380
The ice cream truck is back.

3115
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:52,020
Thank goodness.

3116
03:16:52,580 --> 03:16:53,400
Oh yeah, I see them.

3117
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:54,720
Or rather...

3118
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:55,200
Okay, hold on.

3119
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:57,020
Let's put on our...

3120
03:16:59,160 --> 03:16:59,640
Disguise.

3121
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:01,920
Do auto-Octocamo.

3122
03:17:04,260 --> 03:17:06,940
Sometimes I feel like I should just do...

3123
03:17:06,940 --> 03:17:07,420
Oh, hello.

3124
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:12,320
Manual...

3125
03:17:12,320 --> 03:17:14,300
Octocamo...

3126
03:17:14,300 --> 03:17:16,500
Because sometimes it's a little slow, you know?

3127
03:17:19,490 --> 03:17:21,490
To adjust.

3128
03:17:25,930 --> 03:17:26,850
Hello?

3129
03:17:29,270 --> 03:17:29,750
Hello?

3130
03:17:33,070 --> 03:17:34,830
Yeah, there you go.

3131
03:17:36,530 --> 03:17:37,530
Hello?

3132
03:17:40,050 --> 03:17:41,810
I ate like so much.

3133
03:17:43,210 --> 03:17:44,650
The poor roosters.

3134
03:17:46,310 --> 03:17:47,330
They're a little noisy.

3135
03:17:56,960 --> 03:17:57,960
Adjust.

3136
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:03,420
I definitely

3137
03:18:09,490 --> 03:18:10,310
headshot you!

3138
03:18:10,550 --> 03:18:11,110
You bastard!

3139
03:18:14,930 --> 03:18:15,790
No, no!

3140
03:18:16,590 --> 03:18:17,670
Just kidding.

3141
03:18:25,430 --> 03:18:25,930
Nothing.

3142
03:18:25,930 --> 03:18:26,450
Nothing.

3143
03:18:28,670 --> 03:18:30,550
I hate, I hate everything.

3144
03:18:31,590 --> 03:18:32,390
I hate everything.

3145
03:18:33,210 --> 03:18:34,050
I hate everything!

3146
03:18:34,730 --> 03:18:36,950
I headshot you, you little...

3147
03:18:36,950 --> 03:18:37,870
You little piece.

3148
03:18:59,620 --> 03:19:00,220
Rage.

3149
03:19:03,820 --> 03:19:06,700
It's okay, their weapons are probably poopy numbers.

3150
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:08,400
Oh, wrong way?

3151
03:19:10,600 --> 03:19:11,820
Turn around, snake.

3152
03:19:14,840 --> 03:19:16,500
Oh my god, I thought...

3153
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:17,800
I thought...

3154
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:21,700
Who's opening the door?

3155
03:19:28,400 --> 03:19:29,100
Hey what?

3156
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:31,640
Hey is for horses.

3157
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:32,960
Come in.

3158
03:19:34,980 --> 03:19:36,180
Are they going to run into me?

3159
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:47,180
Oh my goodness.

3160
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:52,930
Uh.

3161
03:19:56,730 --> 03:19:57,690
Scared me.

3162
03:19:59,110 --> 03:19:59,690
Gosh.

3163
03:20:00,210 --> 03:20:01,430
Don't get so close.

3164
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:09,020
Are there guys in here?

3165
03:20:09,860 --> 03:20:11,520
Come on snake, get over it.

3166
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:15,680
Some good ass camo, I know.

3167
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:17,220
Alright.

3168
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:21,960
Okay, I don't think there's any guys here.

3169
03:20:23,940 --> 03:20:25,660
We were at like 80 something.

3170
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:28,000
So we were killing it.

3171
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:29,880
Baby, what's that?

3172
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:31,880
Thank you.

3173
03:20:41,110 --> 03:20:43,710
Alright, so we are heading to a camp.

3174
03:20:48,430 --> 03:20:50,630
We are heading to...

3175
03:20:50,630 --> 03:20:52,270
Let's get this guy.

3176
03:20:54,610 --> 03:20:56,070
Damn, oh my...

3177
03:20:56,070 --> 03:20:56,850
No we are not!

3178
03:20:57,510 --> 03:20:59,290
Okay, he didn't call HQ.

3179
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:00,950
Oh my gosh.

3180
03:21:01,910 --> 03:21:03,030
Stinking guy.

3181
03:21:08,050 --> 03:21:09,170
Stinking guys!

3182
03:21:14,730 --> 03:21:18,630
How many times do I have to teach you this lesson old man?

3183
03:21:31,420 --> 03:21:35,080
I think I'm hearing birds and they are freaking me out a little bit.

3184
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:37,220
I'm going to go...

3185
03:21:50,270 --> 03:21:51,450
I can't tell what I'm hearing.

3186
03:21:51,610 --> 03:21:51,890
Whatever.

3187
03:21:53,610 --> 03:21:54,390
Shut up bird.

3188
03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:56,630
Where did that other guy go?

3189
03:21:57,010 --> 03:21:57,570
Oh, here he is.

3190
03:22:00,110 --> 03:22:00,830
Give me your stuff!

3191
03:22:01,530 --> 03:22:02,810
Do you have anything?

3192
03:22:03,930 --> 03:22:04,870
He has nothing!

3193
03:22:07,310 --> 03:22:07,750
Stingy!

3194
03:22:09,010 --> 03:22:10,130
Oh, that doesn't open?

3195
03:22:10,350 --> 03:22:10,630
Okay.

3196
03:22:15,660 --> 03:22:18,800
Alright, I saw a guy up there.

3197
03:22:24,950 --> 03:22:28,360
There we go.

3198
03:22:32,320 --> 03:22:32,920
Okay.

3199
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:36,060
This place is kind of corralling.

3200
03:22:36,760 --> 03:22:38,300
Where am I going anyway?

3201
03:22:40,240 --> 03:22:41,260
What do you mean hey?

3202
03:22:43,360 --> 03:22:44,420
What did you see?

3203
03:22:44,900 --> 03:22:45,640
You didn't see anything.

3204
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:49,920
What do you mean hey?

3205
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:53,000
Scary this place.

3206
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:54,300
This place is so scary.

3207
03:22:57,920 --> 03:22:59,580
Is there anybody I can get in here?

3208
03:23:03,540 --> 03:23:04,740
Oh my gosh.

3209
03:23:05,900 --> 03:23:07,440
Am I able to get this guy's feet?

3210
03:23:08,640 --> 03:23:09,620
It's just a mosquito.

3211
03:23:10,700 --> 03:23:11,100
Probably.

3212
03:23:12,180 --> 03:23:13,060
It's just a mosquito.

3213
03:23:14,380 --> 03:23:16,080
Oh my god, he would have definitely seen me.

3214
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:25,980
I just realized I don't have a suppressor on this thing anymore or...

3215
03:23:30,890 --> 03:23:32,310
I guess it's fine.

3216
03:23:40,190 --> 03:23:40,990
Oh my gosh.

3217
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:42,270
Go down.

3218
03:23:42,510 --> 03:23:43,110
Go down, snake.

3219
03:23:45,090 --> 03:23:45,990
I'm too scared to get up.

3220
03:23:46,250 --> 03:23:47,090
I'm too scared to get up.

3221
03:23:49,730 --> 03:23:50,690
Custom parts.

3222
03:23:51,690 --> 03:23:52,290
Get in there.

3223
03:23:53,110 --> 03:23:53,590
Nevermind.

3224
03:23:56,350 --> 03:23:58,390
Her ass is too thick.

3225
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:07,180
More stuff.

3226
03:24:09,060 --> 03:24:09,860
More stuff.

3227
03:24:11,480 --> 03:24:12,420
Stand up.

3228
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:14,460
I'm trying to make sure we're safe first.

3229
03:24:16,020 --> 03:24:17,040
Maybe we're safe.

3230
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:19,020
Maybe we're safer than I thought.

3231
03:24:23,810 --> 03:24:25,570
Why does this place feel so empty?

3232
03:24:27,530 --> 03:24:28,430
Oh my god.

3233
03:24:35,380 --> 03:24:35,900
Golly.

3234
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:38,540
You're just gonna scare me like that?

3235
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:42,240
Nobody.

3236
03:24:42,240 --> 03:24:43,580
Oh please, snake.

3237
03:24:43,700 --> 03:24:44,340
Please turn around.

3238
03:24:44,660 --> 03:24:45,160
Please, snake.

3239
03:24:45,220 --> 03:24:45,560
Turn around.

3240
03:24:45,740 --> 03:24:46,020
Please.

3241
03:24:47,720 --> 03:24:48,560
Oh my god.

3242
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:50,520
Thank you.

3243
03:24:51,020 --> 03:24:51,960
Oh my gosh.

3244
03:24:56,510 --> 03:24:57,970
Who goes there?

3245
03:25:00,950 --> 03:25:03,130
Actually, I think that takes care of everybody.

3246
03:25:04,450 --> 03:25:06,350
Well, for now.

3247
03:25:06,470 --> 03:25:07,450
Until somebody wakes up.

3248
03:25:08,770 --> 03:25:10,330
Alright, sneak inside.

3249
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:20,860
Just gonna keep low for now.

3250
03:25:21,520 --> 03:25:22,600
We're gonna keep low.

3251
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:26,760
We're gonna keep, you know, low profile.

3252
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:34,920
And all the way over here.

3253
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:36,900
Actually, can we go inside these tents?

3254
03:25:42,990 --> 03:25:44,730
What's your definition of empty?

3255
03:25:45,210 --> 03:25:49,590
Well, I saw them on the map, but I couldn't see literally anybody walking around.

3256
03:25:52,110 --> 03:25:52,850
I don't know.

3257
03:25:52,850 --> 03:25:53,150
I don't know.

3258
03:26:09,790 --> 03:26:10,990
Look at him go.

3259
03:26:11,050 --> 03:26:11,630
Wait, shake.

3260
03:26:12,190 --> 03:26:12,770
There we go.

3261
03:26:13,710 --> 03:26:14,970
I remember you could do that.

3262
03:26:15,010 --> 03:26:17,470
You could shake the controller and it'll...

3263
03:26:18,430 --> 03:26:22,230
It'll get rid of the octocamel for cutscenes.

3264
03:26:27,510 --> 03:26:28,250
Oh my god.

3265
03:26:29,090 --> 03:26:30,950
Oh my god, I just remembered who's coming up.

3266
03:26:33,970 --> 03:26:34,590
Oh my god.

3267
03:26:35,150 --> 03:26:36,010
Oh my god.

3268
03:26:45,590 --> 03:26:46,910
I just remembered.

3269
03:26:47,770 --> 03:26:49,070
No, don't spoil it.

3270
03:26:49,330 --> 03:26:50,210
Don't spoil it, you guys.

3271
03:26:50,750 --> 03:26:51,350
Don't spoil it.

3272
03:26:51,430 --> 03:26:52,350
Oh my gosh, framerate.

3273
03:26:53,750 --> 03:26:58,850
I don't think I noticed the framerate so badly before the previous time I played this.

3274
03:27:00,910 --> 03:27:03,070
I think I was just so enthralled with everything.

3275
03:27:03,670 --> 03:27:04,890
Which I still am.

3276
03:27:09,110 --> 03:27:09,730
Oh my god.

3277
03:27:10,070 --> 03:27:10,510
Oh, sorry.

3278
03:27:10,750 --> 03:27:11,350
Oh my god.

3279
03:27:15,590 --> 03:27:16,810
He was up there.

3280
03:27:16,850 --> 03:27:17,510
Did you see him?

3281
03:27:18,350 --> 03:27:21,090
Oh my god.

3282
03:27:21,330 --> 03:27:21,870
Oh my god.

3283
03:27:29,010 --> 03:27:32,770
Oh my god.

3284
03:27:36,590 --> 03:27:37,510
Liquid Ocelot!

3285
03:27:40,730 --> 03:27:41,590
Oh my god.

3286
03:27:42,050 --> 03:27:42,650
Get his ass.

3287
03:27:42,710 --> 03:27:43,370
Get his ass, snake.

3288
03:27:43,430 --> 03:27:44,010
Get his ass.

3289
03:27:48,030 --> 03:27:49,550
We're working together as a team.

3290
03:27:49,890 --> 03:27:50,890
Johnny looks so chill.

3291
03:27:52,670 --> 03:27:53,610
Oh my god.

3292
03:27:53,710 --> 03:27:54,670
Oh my god.

3293
03:27:54,830 --> 03:27:55,550
Oh my god.

3294
03:27:57,170 --> 03:27:58,510
How'd you get this number?

3295
03:28:25,290 --> 03:28:25,750
Okay.

3296
03:28:26,190 --> 03:28:27,410
You're not here for the fun.

3297
03:28:29,470 --> 03:28:30,390
Oh gosh.

3298
03:28:36,970 --> 03:28:37,910
He's looking at me.

3299
03:28:38,330 --> 03:28:38,770
Never mind.

3300
03:28:45,570 --> 03:28:47,630
I thought she was a peace walker.

3301
03:28:54,200 --> 03:28:55,880
I didn't kill anything.

3302
03:28:56,080 --> 03:28:57,080
I used non-lethal.

3303
03:28:57,300 --> 03:28:58,100
He can't blame me.

3304
03:28:58,360 --> 03:29:00,100
I didn't kill any of his special units.

3305
03:29:01,240 --> 03:29:02,200
The froggies.

3306
03:29:04,700 --> 03:29:05,480
Activate it.

3307
03:29:06,140 --> 03:29:06,620
Oh my god.

3308
03:29:06,980 --> 03:29:07,840
Here it is.

3309
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:10,060
Liquid!

3310
03:29:15,530 --> 03:29:17,790
I love that nobody is noticing him.

3311
03:29:18,550 --> 03:29:19,710
Just this guy up.

3312
03:29:21,430 --> 03:29:25,910
This is how good of a... This is how good of a stealthy person I am.

3313
03:29:29,230 --> 03:29:30,190
What's going on?

3314
03:29:31,670 --> 03:29:32,490
Oh my gosh.

3315
03:29:32,550 --> 03:29:33,850
What if we all had a group?

3316
03:29:34,330 --> 03:29:36,550
What if we all had a group IBS attack?

3317
03:29:36,910 --> 03:29:37,130
Okay.

3318
03:29:37,630 --> 03:29:39,710
3, 2, 1...

3319
03:29:55,250 --> 03:29:56,050
Oh no!

3320
03:29:59,750 --> 03:30:00,450
Oh my god.

3321
03:30:00,490 --> 03:30:01,350
Watch your pants, Johnny.

3322
03:30:03,190 --> 03:30:05,210
They love showing his butt, don't they?

3323
03:30:09,610 --> 03:30:11,190
Oh my gosh.

3324
03:30:11,290 --> 03:30:12,430
Group panic attack!

3325
03:30:12,730 --> 03:30:20,330
Who could that mysterious lady be?

3326
03:30:24,630 --> 03:30:25,650
Oh my god.

3327
03:30:25,670 --> 03:30:26,530
It's mayhem!

3328
03:30:27,260 --> 03:30:28,370
Oh my god.

3329
03:30:30,140 --> 03:30:31,190
Oh god.

3330
03:30:31,790 --> 03:30:34,850
Oh my god!

3331
03:30:37,230 --> 03:30:38,170
Oh

3332
03:30:41,270 --> 03:30:42,490
my god.

3333
03:30:51,200 --> 03:30:52,990
They are turning on each other.

3334
03:30:53,730 --> 03:30:55,130
Friendly fire!

3335
03:30:55,770 --> 03:30:56,910
Oh my god.

3336
03:31:06,630 --> 03:31:07,990
Liquid, you freak.

3337
03:31:10,450 --> 03:31:11,550
Friendly bonk.

3338
03:31:13,590 --> 03:31:15,230
Get out of my way!

3339
03:31:15,790 --> 03:31:16,850
Get out of my way!

3340
03:31:17,270 --> 03:31:18,590
Get out of my way!

3341
03:31:18,730 --> 03:31:21,130
I still got... I got my senses, mostly.

3342
03:31:21,870 --> 03:31:22,710
Come on, snake.

3343
03:31:23,310 --> 03:31:25,750
God, that ass is just so wild.

3344
03:31:27,130 --> 03:31:29,030
They unironically ate lunches.

3345
03:31:30,130 --> 03:31:33,590
Was that the... What's a lunchly?

3346
03:31:36,490 --> 03:31:37,130
Lunchable?

3347
03:31:37,130 --> 03:31:38,490
I love those.

3348
03:31:44,010 --> 03:31:45,090
Oh my god.

3349
03:31:46,210 --> 03:31:46,610
Liquid!

3350
03:31:48,650 --> 03:31:50,550
Oh it's the Mr. Beast Lunchable.

3351
03:31:50,590 --> 03:31:51,970
I thought they were called the Feastables.

3352
03:32:03,590 --> 03:32:03,590
We

3353
03:32:08,990 --> 03:32:12,430
are copies of our father, after all.

3354
03:32:14,890 --> 03:32:20,290
We are free of the shackles of fate.

3355
03:32:22,030 --> 03:32:25,250
Snake, brother.

3356
03:32:27,910 --> 03:32:29,190
We are free.

3357
03:32:39,710 --> 03:32:43,890
Watch as I surpass my own orgy.

3358
03:32:46,470 --> 03:32:49,910
That's real rich, coming from a guy who's not even using his own body.

3359
03:32:50,230 --> 03:32:54,930
My favorite

3360
03:33:06,860 --> 03:33:08,300
Judy Broi.

3361
03:33:09,620 --> 03:33:11,260
Lambda, thank you for the Akasupa.

3362
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:15,200
Naomi!

3363
03:33:16,420 --> 03:33:17,600
Oh my god, thank god.

3364
03:33:18,020 --> 03:33:23,720
The notification, like... Oh sorry, I forgot to press X, but it's okay.

3365
03:33:23,780 --> 03:33:25,380
I don't want to see your face anymore than I have to.

3366
03:33:27,060 --> 03:33:29,740
The notification blocked her face for a moment.

3367
03:33:29,840 --> 03:33:30,360
It was great.

3368
03:33:47,540 --> 03:33:50,000
I hate you so much.

3369
03:33:50,300 --> 03:33:52,280
She just talks and riddles.

3370
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:58,660
Also, what were you doing standing beside Liquid?

3371
03:34:00,080 --> 03:34:01,680
You treacherous bitch.

3372
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:02,820
Get out of here.

3373
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:05,620
Imagine if Ocelot meowed in MGS4.

3374
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:08,240
It would be a beautiful thing, wouldn't it?

3375
03:34:08,900 --> 03:34:10,340
But this is Liquid Ocelot.

3376
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:20,540
Hi Liquid!

3377
03:34:28,170 --> 03:34:29,330
He's so cool.

3378
03:34:29,330 --> 03:34:31,330
You like my glasses?

3379
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:36,850
Snake!

3380
03:34:37,590 --> 03:34:38,510
Fight it!

3381
03:34:39,150 --> 03:34:39,750
Snake!

3382
03:34:47,300 --> 03:34:48,620
Get out of here.

3383
03:34:49,120 --> 03:34:50,560
I don't want to see your face anymore.

3384
03:34:51,780 --> 03:34:52,900
I'm already disgusted.

3385
03:34:53,080 --> 03:34:54,020
My day is ruined.

3386
03:34:57,780 --> 03:34:59,740
Naomi sucks so much.

3387
03:35:01,900 --> 03:35:02,600
I know.

3388
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:07,020
Horrible.

3389
03:35:08,480 --> 03:35:09,880
Bye geckos!

3390
03:35:11,240 --> 03:35:11,780
Oh Snake!

3391
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:14,300
Snake!

3392
03:35:15,920 --> 03:35:16,980
Use the little thing!

3393
03:35:17,940 --> 03:35:20,180
Oh my gosh, Johnny is out here being like...

3394
03:35:20,180 --> 03:35:20,360
Oh!

3395
03:35:20,520 --> 03:35:21,360
Anybody?

3396
03:35:27,750 --> 03:35:29,470
Bipedal cows.

3397
03:35:38,650 --> 03:35:40,630
Johnny our boy!

3398
03:35:41,150 --> 03:35:41,610
Yay!

3399
03:35:45,830 --> 03:35:50,130
We end with almost 300,000 DP.

3400
03:35:51,710 --> 03:35:52,390
Nice!

3401
03:35:53,750 --> 03:35:54,850
Yay!

3402
03:35:55,130 --> 03:35:55,330
Yay!

3403
03:35:55,570 --> 03:35:55,570
Yay!

3404
03:35:57,010 --> 03:35:58,130
Special item.

3405
03:35:58,210 --> 03:35:59,050
I should have used some more.

3406
03:36:00,790 --> 03:36:01,570
Oh my gosh!

3407
03:36:01,670 --> 03:36:03,570
You get DP from watching the flashbacks?

3408
03:36:04,070 --> 03:36:04,370
Okay.

3409
03:36:04,650 --> 03:36:05,390
Time to spam.

3410
03:36:06,250 --> 03:36:07,770
Don't be a prisoner of fate.

3411
03:36:07,990 --> 03:36:09,190
Also follow your destiny.

3412
03:36:09,310 --> 03:36:10,510
What does that even mean?

3413
03:36:10,810 --> 03:36:11,730
I know!

3414
03:36:11,870 --> 03:36:13,050
She's so horrible!

3415
03:36:13,970 --> 03:36:16,270
4.7 million to go baby!

3416
03:36:26,030 --> 03:36:27,030
Save the game.

3417
03:36:27,690 --> 03:36:29,430
And I think that's act one, right?

3418
03:36:33,550 --> 03:36:34,610
Yeah, we did everything.

3419
03:36:34,750 --> 03:36:35,130
We're fine.

3420
03:36:37,070 --> 03:36:38,090
We got the doll.

3421
03:36:39,770 --> 03:36:40,210
Yay!

3422
03:36:45,170 --> 03:36:47,290
I think going non-lethal gets you more points.

3423
03:36:47,330 --> 03:36:49,890
I think I might just stick with non-lethal then.

3424
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:52,930
I have enough that I... And especially weapons too.

3425
03:36:53,010 --> 03:36:54,470
Like I got sniper stuff and everything.

3426
03:36:54,910 --> 03:36:59,210
Since I have everything unlocked, I feel like I can do non-lethal pretty much the whole way through.

3427
03:37:00,650 --> 03:37:01,470
Maybe I will.

3428
03:37:01,530 --> 03:37:02,510
Maybe I'll be kind.

3429
03:37:03,330 --> 03:37:04,150
Oh wait!

3430
03:37:08,370 --> 03:37:09,230
Mission briefing!

3431
03:37:09,490 --> 03:37:09,730
See?

3432
03:37:09,930 --> 03:37:10,710
We didn't...

3433
03:37:11,410 --> 03:37:14,450
You can also view this mission briefing from the main menu.

3434
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:15,390
See guys?

3435
03:37:15,470 --> 03:37:17,550
I was gonna say I think it...

3436
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:21,190
I think it does it.

3437
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:23,630
Okay, now we can check the figures.

3438
03:37:37,440 --> 03:37:47,060
2.33 3.77 6.10 9.87 15 The eggs are all messed up.

3439
03:37:47,300 --> 03:37:49,220
It's okay, you'll learn how to make them.

3440
03:37:49,640 --> 03:37:51,420
84 84

3441
03:38:04,710 --> 03:38:07,550
No, she wants to make them sunny side up.

3442
03:38:09,890 --> 03:38:11,270
Oh, Olga.

3443
03:38:12,250 --> 03:38:14,170
Oh, the picture of Olga.

3444
03:38:14,390 --> 03:38:15,250
Who took that picture?

3445
03:38:16,140 --> 03:38:17,490
Where did they get that picture?

3446
03:38:19,230 --> 03:38:20,050
Sunny!

3447
03:38:21,770 --> 03:38:22,590
Sunny!

3448
03:38:24,270 --> 03:38:25,090
Sunny!

3449
03:38:26,030 --> 03:38:27,130
Oh my gosh, Sunny.

3450
03:38:27,650 --> 03:38:29,230
I can't stop saying Sunny.

3451
03:38:30,390 --> 03:38:31,710
Sweet little baby.

3452
03:38:35,860 --> 03:38:37,910
Eat the eggs, Uncle Hal.

3453
03:38:39,250 --> 03:38:40,070
Yeah.

3454
03:38:42,030 --> 03:38:43,670
Eat the eggs.

3455
03:38:45,250 --> 03:38:46,770
Oh, back from the dead?

3456
03:38:49,130 --> 03:38:50,750
Eat the eggs, Snake.

3457
03:38:53,210 --> 03:38:54,950
Oh, Sunny.

3458
03:38:55,470 --> 03:38:56,230
They're delicious.

3459
03:38:59,110 --> 03:38:59,990
Yeah.

3460
03:39:02,050 --> 03:39:02,450
Okay.

3461
03:39:07,990 --> 03:39:10,890
Oh, come on.

3462
03:39:10,890 --> 03:39:14,650
Oh, she's doing her best.

3463
03:39:44,780 --> 03:39:46,660
Are you okay?

3464
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:50,220
Make the mother of all omelettes here, Snake.

3465
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:58,760
I only have ten kills.

3466
03:40:00,340 --> 03:40:04,720
It looked like the PMC soldiers all went haywire en masse, too.

3467
03:40:05,160 --> 03:40:10,340
I thought it might be a form of ADS, but I didn't detect any aberrations in the EM field.

3468
03:40:11,300 --> 03:40:12,400
You were lucky.

3469
03:40:12,940 --> 03:40:15,400
Some of those guys' hearts simply stopped.

3470
03:40:21,240 --> 03:40:22,540
She was there.

3471
03:40:24,800 --> 03:40:26,400
Naomi was at Liquid's side.

3472
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:27,280
Yeah.

3473
03:40:32,420 --> 03:40:36,160
I hope you never see her.

3474
03:40:37,700 --> 03:40:39,240
I have a knife kill.

3475
03:40:41,020 --> 03:40:42,500
How did I get a knife kill?

3476
03:40:44,400 --> 03:40:44,960
I did?

3477
03:40:49,200 --> 03:40:50,400
CQC uses zero.

3478
03:40:50,500 --> 03:40:51,360
I tried.

3479
03:40:52,100 --> 03:40:54,840
I literally punched the frog.

3480
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:55,500
What happened?

3481
03:40:57,560 --> 03:40:59,240
I punched a frog.

3482
03:41:04,240 --> 03:41:06,680
I punched a frog.

3483
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:07,960
What do you mean zero?

3484
03:41:21,930 --> 03:41:24,350
With a cigarette is too much.

3485
03:41:28,900 --> 03:41:32,640
How do I save my pig ears?

3486
03:41:37,050 --> 03:41:38,930
Otacon, you were stopped.

3487
03:41:39,430 --> 03:41:42,190
Everybody is so mean to Sunny for no reason.

3488
03:41:48,410 --> 03:41:50,690
Time in cardboard box zero.

3489
03:41:50,910 --> 03:41:53,930
I'm really... I'm losing my roots.

3490
03:41:57,670 --> 03:41:59,930
Yeah, you tell him.

3491
03:42:11,760 --> 03:42:13,760
The eggs are fine.

3492
03:42:14,140 --> 03:42:15,180
The eggs are fine.

3493
03:42:19,940 --> 03:42:22,140
God, jump scare.

3494
03:42:30,340 --> 03:42:31,780
Deepfake Naomi.

3495
03:43:01,340 --> 03:43:02,240
How do I switch?

3496
03:43:09,620 --> 03:43:11,060
How do I switch?

3497
03:43:13,040 --> 03:43:14,080
Hold on.

3498
03:43:21,640 --> 03:43:22,860
R2 isn't doing anything.

3499
03:43:22,980 --> 03:43:23,580
Maybe, hold on.

3500
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:26,420
No, it's not working.

3501
03:43:30,960 --> 03:43:32,120
Yeah, we know.

3502
03:43:33,200 --> 03:43:34,240
I'm getting money.

3503
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:39,460
Square.

3504
03:43:44,680 --> 03:43:48,440
Where is my pig ears?

3505
03:43:49,840 --> 03:43:50,640
Where would they be?

3506
03:43:54,860 --> 03:43:56,200
This is so cool.

3507
03:43:57,360 --> 03:43:59,340
Yeah, thanks for the fox die.

3508
03:44:00,220 --> 03:44:00,800
Oh, upstairs?

3509
03:44:00,940 --> 03:44:01,040
Ok.

3510
03:44:05,160 --> 03:44:06,280
Oh my god!

3511
03:44:08,960 --> 03:44:09,720
Is

3512
03:44:15,890 --> 03:44:17,210
that a PS3?

3513
03:44:21,270 --> 03:44:22,030
Music.

3514
03:44:22,030 --> 03:44:22,130
Music.

3515
03:44:31,310 --> 03:44:32,350
Go Sunny!

3516
03:44:35,590 --> 03:44:36,710
She's playing a PSP!

3517
03:44:47,110 --> 03:44:48,150
Oh wait!

3518
03:44:49,010 --> 03:44:49,970
I just have the one.

3519
03:44:51,090 --> 03:44:52,270
Ok, we'll have to get the rest.

3520
03:44:57,490 --> 03:44:59,190
We'll have to get the rest.

3521
03:45:13,050 --> 03:45:13,890
Oh.

3522
03:45:26,210 --> 03:45:26,790
Snake.

3523
03:45:27,670 --> 03:45:34,850
As you recall, following the Shadow Moses incident nine years ago, Naomi was detained by the authorities.

3524
03:45:35,670 --> 03:45:38,210
But someone arranged for her escape.

3525
03:45:39,130 --> 03:45:42,350
Yeah, I hear they added that to my rap sheet too.

3526
03:45:44,990 --> 03:45:45,850
What is she playing?

3527
03:45:45,930 --> 03:45:46,990
I can hear it.

3528
03:45:47,550 --> 03:45:53,070
He must have taken her prisoner himself and forced her to do research in his facility in South America.

3529
03:45:55,130 --> 03:45:59,270
Actually, I still cook my eggs the way Naomi teaches Sunny.

3530
03:46:00,630 --> 03:46:02,330
I still cook my eggs that way.

3531
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:29,390
Oh yeah.

3532
03:46:44,190 --> 03:46:46,390
Oh, battery.

3533
03:46:50,010 --> 03:46:51,370
I'm stealing from ourselves.

3534
03:46:54,430 --> 03:47:03,530
The address is fake, but Sunny was able to track the message back through its proxies based on access date time stamps and data transfer bars.

3535
03:47:03,550 --> 03:47:04,510
This is so cool.

3536
03:47:05,250 --> 03:47:09,510
Apparently, the message originated from a server in South America.

3537
03:47:10,490 --> 03:47:12,270
I wouldn't exactly call it 100%...

3538
03:47:12,270 --> 03:47:13,490
Double Otacon vision.

3539
03:47:16,010 --> 03:47:17,710
Colonel, where's Meryl?

3540
03:47:18,670 --> 03:47:19,950
Come on, what did I get?

3541
03:47:19,950 --> 03:47:22,610
I know she left the Middle East in pursuit of liquid.

3542
03:47:25,010 --> 03:47:27,570
I'm sure our sock is on to us by now.

3543
03:47:28,070 --> 03:47:29,850
We can't chase that line too far.

3544
03:47:33,610 --> 03:47:35,270
Don't worry, I'll do it to everybody.

3545
03:47:36,350 --> 03:47:36,490
No!

3546
03:47:36,950 --> 03:47:37,270
Snake!

3547
03:47:37,610 --> 03:47:37,990
Stand up.

3548
03:47:38,110 --> 03:47:41,530
I secured you landing clearance at El Dorado International Airport.

3549
03:47:42,150 --> 03:47:44,270
You'll be acting as a UN inspector.

3550
03:47:46,390 --> 03:47:47,390
South America.

3551
03:47:47,830 --> 03:47:49,450
That's about 20 hours from here.

3552
03:47:49,450 --> 03:47:51,390
Am I in the movie?

3553
03:47:52,090 --> 03:47:52,850
Can you see me?

3554
03:47:54,190 --> 03:47:55,670
Can you see me in the movie?

3555
03:48:05,410 --> 03:48:06,810
I'm trying to jump!

3556
03:48:08,070 --> 03:48:09,510
Pick me up, snake!

3557
03:48:11,390 --> 03:48:12,850
Solo snaking mission.

3558
03:48:13,130 --> 03:48:14,150
Oh gosh.

3559
03:48:16,450 --> 03:48:17,370
Oh hello!

3560
03:48:17,730 --> 03:48:18,150
What a...

3561
03:48:26,040 --> 03:48:29,940
The rebels are still pitched in battle against the PMCs.

3562
03:48:30,380 --> 03:48:30,760
Uppies!

3563
03:48:31,620 --> 03:48:32,140
Uppies!

3564
03:48:32,320 --> 03:48:33,020
Uppies sake!

3565
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:37,400
20 hours until we land.

3566
03:48:37,860 --> 03:48:38,380
Got it.

3567
03:48:39,220 --> 03:48:40,700
I'll have a look at the documents.

3568
03:48:41,060 --> 03:48:41,820
Is he gonna kick me?

3569
03:48:42,420 --> 03:48:43,400
No, snake, don't kick me.

3570
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:50,020
Okay, snake.

3571
03:48:50,720 --> 03:48:52,000
Otacon is like...

3572
03:48:53,640 --> 03:48:55,140
Otacon is like, please.

3573
03:48:56,760 --> 03:49:00,800
Please, snake, I know you have accelerated aging, but it's not gonna help.

3574
03:49:01,260 --> 03:49:01,960
We got a battery.

3575
03:49:02,940 --> 03:49:04,060
Face camo!

3576
03:49:04,180 --> 03:49:06,260
Otacon face camo!

3577
03:49:08,300 --> 03:49:11,000
We got the Buckeye 2 theme!

3578
03:49:12,700 --> 03:49:16,720
Oh my gosh, bumping.

3579
03:49:16,800 --> 03:49:18,740
That's what I picked up when I bumped into him.

3580
03:49:19,520 --> 03:49:20,220
That's hilarious.

3581
03:49:22,940 --> 03:49:23,500
Ahem.

3582
03:49:30,660 --> 03:49:31,220
Saving.

3583
03:49:31,900 --> 03:49:32,900
Let's go, baby!

3584
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:35,980
Alrighty, righty!

3585
03:49:39,160 --> 03:49:40,240
Otacon playthrough.

3586
03:49:41,660 --> 03:49:43,240
Nobody would want to hurt me.

3587
03:49:43,360 --> 03:49:45,580
They'd be like, what an upstanding looking guy.

3588
03:49:48,820 --> 03:49:50,600
Oh wait, this is Act 2, right?

3589
03:49:52,660 --> 03:49:53,160
Yeah.

3590
03:49:54,660 --> 03:49:55,900
Wait a second.

3591
03:49:56,360 --> 03:49:56,700
Wait.

3592
03:49:57,260 --> 03:49:57,960
Stop it.

3593
03:49:59,220 --> 03:50:03,460
I thought I was so used to seeing smoking snake, I didn't realize that we were on Act 2.

3594
03:50:03,900 --> 03:50:04,480
Where is he?

3595
03:50:05,240 --> 03:50:05,920
No, wait.

3596
03:50:07,500 --> 03:50:10,760
I'm just gonna skip and then I'll go straight to the meat.

3597
03:50:11,820 --> 03:50:12,720
No, skip!

3598
03:50:13,520 --> 03:50:14,020
Skip!

3599
03:50:14,620 --> 03:50:15,560
Skip, skip, skip, skip!

3600
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,260
Don't read.

3601
03:50:17,780 --> 03:50:18,580
Everybody don't look.

3602
03:50:18,580 --> 03:50:19,660
Everybody.

3603
03:50:22,540 --> 03:50:23,920
Skip, skip, skip, skip.

3604
03:50:24,340 --> 03:50:26,400
Oh, this is what I first did.

3605
03:50:29,660 --> 03:50:30,940
Maybe in options.

3606
03:50:32,160 --> 03:50:33,320
Get me out of here.

3607
03:50:34,660 --> 03:50:36,360
Return to main menu.

3608
03:50:39,240 --> 03:50:41,300
I don't think I can.

3609
03:50:42,060 --> 03:50:42,960
That's okay.

3610
03:50:44,380 --> 03:50:45,120
Oh, Sunny.

3611
03:50:45,120 --> 03:50:47,420
You guys, look at Sunny.

3612
03:50:47,480 --> 03:50:48,600
Look at her down there.

3613
03:50:49,500 --> 03:50:50,140
It is options?

3614
03:50:50,280 --> 03:50:50,680
It is?

3615
03:50:51,360 --> 03:50:52,080
Did I miss it?

3616
03:50:53,380 --> 03:50:54,340
Did I miss it?

3617
03:50:57,280 --> 03:50:58,880
It's not here.

3618
03:50:59,060 --> 03:51:00,020
What are you talking about?

3619
03:51:01,960 --> 03:51:03,160
Oh, it's under save.

3620
03:51:04,600 --> 03:51:05,320
Thank you.

3621
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:08,140
There we go.

3622
03:51:09,700 --> 03:51:10,500
Okay.

3623
03:51:13,100 --> 03:51:14,900
Act 1 done.

3624
03:51:27,640 --> 03:51:30,260
I am emotional.

3625
03:51:34,100 --> 03:51:39,140
There is a mission briefing, but I guess we did miss the initial ones.

3626
03:51:41,040 --> 03:51:41,520
You know.

3627
03:51:44,180 --> 03:51:44,840
You know.

3628
03:51:44,840 --> 03:51:45,800
But maybe it's okay.

3629
03:51:47,080 --> 03:51:48,480
Metal gear is lame.

3630
03:51:48,880 --> 03:51:51,620
You know, bait used to be believable.

3631
03:52:00,340 --> 03:52:02,740
There is also the virtual range.

3632
03:52:02,840 --> 03:52:03,560
What's under extras?

3633
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:06,400
Start with save data.

3634
03:52:08,260 --> 03:52:09,780
Let's do it with...

3635
03:52:14,910 --> 03:52:15,990
We'll do this one.

3636
03:52:18,670 --> 03:52:19,950
Bing, bong.

3637
03:52:22,440 --> 03:52:24,840
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bong.

3638
03:52:25,740 --> 03:52:28,000
The bait has changed.

3639
03:52:29,840 --> 03:52:31,460
This theme is so good.

3640
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:33,560
Old Snake theme is so...

3641
03:52:34,200 --> 03:52:35,480
Makes me so...

3642
03:52:37,320 --> 03:52:39,540
I gotta get my CQC in.

3643
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:41,680
Holy cow!

3644
03:52:44,180 --> 03:52:46,480
Does this not count as CQC anymore?

3645
03:52:49,720 --> 03:52:51,920
Does this not count as CQC anymore?

3646
03:52:56,520 --> 03:52:57,640
Take him down!

3647
03:53:02,870 --> 03:53:03,930
How do I flip him?

3648
03:53:04,390 --> 03:53:05,150
Oh, just like that.

3649
03:53:05,170 --> 03:53:05,510
There we go.

3650
03:53:05,970 --> 03:53:07,110
Maybe that's what they want me to do.

3651
03:53:07,410 --> 03:53:09,210
Run towards him and...

3652
03:53:10,310 --> 03:53:11,910
Maybe that's what they want me to do.

3653
03:53:14,370 --> 03:53:14,770
Box.

3654
03:53:18,270 --> 03:53:19,070
Drum can.

3655
03:53:20,070 --> 03:53:26,490
I love when you can briefly see him sitting inside.

3656
03:53:27,730 --> 03:53:31,330
And he's got his little... He's not even prepped for action.

3657
03:53:31,790 --> 03:53:35,790
He's got his little knees pulled up to his chest.

3658
03:53:37,610 --> 03:53:39,670
Like he's like sitting in his fort.

3659
03:53:44,290 --> 03:53:44,970
Oh,

3660
03:53:48,960 --> 03:53:49,700
it won't let me go.

3661
03:53:50,300 --> 03:53:52,200
Gosh, this barrel is nasty.

3662
03:53:52,540 --> 03:53:54,440
Hold on.

3663
03:53:57,180 --> 03:53:58,040
Sorry, Snake.

3664
03:54:00,580 --> 03:54:01,360
Sorry, Snake.

3665
03:54:03,520 --> 03:54:04,480
I wanna roll.

3666
03:54:04,620 --> 03:54:05,100
Wait, hold on.

3667
03:54:07,080 --> 03:54:08,040
Wait, what is it?

3668
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:09,260
Circle or square?

3669
03:54:09,740 --> 03:54:11,760
No, it's X, right?

3670
03:54:12,040 --> 03:54:12,340
X.

3671
03:54:13,140 --> 03:54:14,360
Get on your side and roll.

3672
03:54:14,420 --> 03:54:14,780
There we go.

3673
03:54:16,180 --> 03:54:16,620
Stop!

3674
03:54:18,400 --> 03:54:19,860
It won't let me go any further.

3675
03:54:20,000 --> 03:54:20,220
No!

3676
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:21,900
I wanted to do a story.

3677
03:54:22,640 --> 03:54:23,040
Stop!

3678
03:54:24,560 --> 03:54:26,060
Oh, he's gonna throw up again.

3679
03:54:33,900 --> 03:54:34,700
Gotta head out.

3680
03:54:34,760 --> 03:54:35,300
Take care, Vinto.

3681
03:54:35,440 --> 03:54:36,100
Thank you!

3682
03:54:37,140 --> 03:54:39,240
We're just about to end too, so no worries.

3683
03:54:39,800 --> 03:54:41,880
No worries at all.

3684
03:54:41,960 --> 03:54:42,840
No worries at all.

3685
03:54:44,380 --> 03:54:45,240
What is that?

3686
03:54:46,900 --> 03:54:47,960
What is that thing?

3687
03:54:51,060 --> 03:54:51,880
What is it?

3688
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:54,040
What is that thing?

3689
03:54:55,040 --> 03:54:56,260
This is a lot of fun though.

3690
03:54:56,440 --> 03:55:01,140
It takes a second to get back into it, but we're back into it, I feel, so...

3691
03:55:04,740 --> 03:55:08,140
I will put on the other song and then we will...

3692
03:55:12,920 --> 03:55:13,560
Head out.

3693
03:55:13,680 --> 03:55:14,320
Sea Breeze.

3694
03:55:15,940 --> 03:55:17,280
Sea Breeze.

3695
03:55:17,280 --> 03:55:20,020
Wait, not Sea Breeze.

3696
03:55:20,080 --> 03:55:20,480
What's the other one?

3697
03:55:20,480 --> 03:55:20,620
Wait.

3698
03:55:23,030 --> 03:55:24,480
Someone mentioned Sea Breeze earlier.

3699
03:55:25,620 --> 03:55:26,540
Theme of Tara.

3700
03:55:45,950 --> 03:55:47,210
It's so chill.

3701
03:55:47,870 --> 03:55:53,130
I hope you guys had fun with our first act of Metal Gear.

3702
03:55:53,750 --> 03:55:55,910
We'll pick it up again next week.

3703
03:55:55,910 --> 03:55:59,010
Not Saturday though, because I do have something on Saturday.

3704
03:55:59,810 --> 03:56:01,870
So it'll be probably Metal Gear Friday.

3705
03:56:02,830 --> 03:56:03,910
Probably we'll do...

3706
03:56:05,330 --> 03:56:08,090
A little later, since it is Friday and not...

3707
03:56:09,530 --> 03:56:10,010
Saturday.

3708
03:56:12,950 --> 03:56:13,710
But yeah.

3709
03:56:14,930 --> 03:56:15,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3710
03:56:15,870 --> 03:56:16,650
Thanks for the stream.

3711
03:56:16,790 --> 03:56:17,830
Thank you guys.

3712
03:56:18,150 --> 03:56:19,370
This is so much fun.

3713
03:56:21,610 --> 03:56:23,470
Oh gosh, I love this game.

3714
03:56:23,930 --> 03:56:24,910
I love this game.

3715
03:56:24,910 --> 03:56:26,270
I love this series.

3716
03:56:26,510 --> 03:56:27,130
I love this series.

3717
03:56:27,250 --> 03:56:27,890
I love this game.

3718
03:56:28,550 --> 03:56:29,030
I love it.

3719
03:56:29,170 --> 03:56:29,910
I love it, love it, love it.

3720
03:56:32,170 --> 03:56:34,910
We'll have a fun time with this.

3721
03:56:35,870 --> 03:56:37,570
If you don't know about the game.

3722
03:56:37,710 --> 03:56:41,310
And also I'm really excited to aim for the Boktai.

3723
03:56:42,150 --> 03:56:43,910
The solar gun, so...

3724
03:56:45,530 --> 03:56:46,970
We will try for it.

3725
03:56:47,670 --> 03:56:50,070
And try for also either bandana or...

3726
03:56:51,690 --> 03:56:52,730
Or camo.

3727
03:56:52,730 --> 03:56:54,150
One of the...

3728
03:56:54,670 --> 03:56:56,010
5 million is...

3729
03:56:58,670 --> 03:57:01,110
I'm gonna look up what's the best way to get DP.

3730
03:57:02,630 --> 03:57:03,630
I'm gonna look it up.

3731
03:57:04,290 --> 03:57:06,730
Because what if I can find like a...

3732
03:57:07,690 --> 03:57:11,330
What if I can find something and then just off stream I can farm.

3733
03:57:11,910 --> 03:57:12,270
You know?

3734
03:57:12,930 --> 03:57:13,890
That'd be great.

3735
03:57:15,670 --> 03:57:17,250
Be careful with that search.

3736
03:57:19,450 --> 03:57:19,970
Why?

3737
03:57:21,070 --> 03:57:21,590
I've

3738
03:57:26,990 --> 03:57:29,510
already played the game, so I don't have any spoilers.

3739
03:57:31,050 --> 03:57:32,790
I don't have any...

3740
03:57:32,790 --> 03:57:34,330
I don't have any spoilers.

3741
03:57:34,910 --> 03:57:37,530
Because I've already played the game, so...

3742
03:57:37,530 --> 03:57:39,870
If you're concerned about that, it's no worries.

3743
03:57:42,550 --> 03:57:43,070
Wait,

3744
03:57:47,890 --> 03:57:48,110
what?

3745
03:57:48,550 --> 03:57:49,770
It's bad phrasing?

3746
03:57:50,590 --> 03:57:51,150
Oh, it is?

3747
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:52,190
Wait.

3748
03:57:52,190 --> 03:57:52,290
Wait.

3749
03:57:54,010 --> 03:57:55,210
Is this something not good?

3750
03:58:00,650 --> 03:58:02,290
It stands for something else.

3751
03:58:05,730 --> 03:58:07,130
Is this something actually bad?

3752
03:58:12,730 --> 03:58:13,530
I'm scared.

3753
03:58:13,650 --> 03:58:14,510
Did I say something bad?

3754
03:58:15,290 --> 03:58:16,190
It's not actually bad?

3755
03:58:16,290 --> 03:58:17,850
Okay, I was really scared for a second.

3756
03:58:19,970 --> 03:58:21,730
I was scared for a second.

3757
03:58:25,330 --> 03:58:26,890
You scared me.

3758
03:58:27,230 --> 03:58:28,790
It's just NSFW, okay.

3759
03:58:29,150 --> 03:58:30,850
I thought I said something...

3760
03:58:32,350 --> 03:58:33,390
Something illegal.

3761
03:58:37,830 --> 03:58:42,430
I thought I said something really scary.

3762
03:58:43,870 --> 03:58:47,350
It stands for dragon punch, so you are going to get a lot of street fighter.

3763
03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:47,710
No!

3764
03:58:50,390 --> 03:58:50,790
No!

3765
03:58:54,090 --> 03:58:54,490
Guys!

3766
03:58:58,650 --> 03:59:00,070
What the hell is this?

3767
03:59:00,270 --> 03:59:01,930
This is not the best is yet to come.

3768
03:59:03,210 --> 03:59:05,070
Actually, I don't think I can listen to this right now.

3769
03:59:05,150 --> 03:59:05,750
I think I'll cry.

3770
03:59:08,630 --> 03:59:09,550
Theme of Tara.

3771
03:59:21,250 --> 03:59:22,270
Yo, dead cell.

3772
03:59:38,390 --> 03:59:39,030
Come on!

3773
03:59:39,090 --> 03:59:39,890
Bust a move, snake!

3774
03:59:41,010 --> 03:59:42,170
Oh, sorry.

3775
03:59:42,510 --> 03:59:43,390
Collateral damage.

3776
04:00:08,670 --> 04:00:13,960
This is part of the break dancing process.

3777
04:00:15,600 --> 04:00:16,900
Oh, oh.

3778
04:00:22,720 --> 04:00:24,240
Thank you guys!

3779
04:00:24,360 --> 04:00:25,000
Otobito!

3780
04:00:25,300 --> 04:00:28,460
See you guys with more Metal Gear next week!

3781
04:00:29,060 --> 04:00:29,780
Bye bye!

3782
04:01:50,780 --> 04:01:52,300
I forgot to show.

3783
04:01:53,720 --> 04:01:54,900
I forgot to show.

3784
04:01:56,420 --> 04:01:57,260
I just remembered.

3785
04:01:57,620 --> 04:01:59,040
Oh no, I broke my computer.

3786
04:02:00,600 --> 04:02:00,940
Look.

3787
04:02:06,270 --> 04:02:07,350
Mental eye system.

3788
04:02:09,510 --> 04:02:10,230
Scanning.

3789
04:02:11,210 --> 04:02:12,510
Freak detected.

3790
04:02:14,390 --> 04:02:19,350
Executing operation 8008.
