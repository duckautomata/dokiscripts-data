1
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,660
Pop pop, ba-da, pop-ba-bra, pop-bop.

2
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,180
Welcome home, master, princess.

3
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Hello everybody!

4
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,600
Hello!

5
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,580
Welcome back to Metal Gear Saturdays!

6
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
Yippee!

7
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Hello, hello, hello, Minto.

8
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
Hello, hello.

9
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,620
Hey, big boss.

10
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,180
No.

11
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,980
Just boss.

12
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,700
Good morning, Minto!

13
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,000
I just came back from an all-night idol live.

14
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Go to sleep?

15
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,540
What are you doing?

16
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,840
The music is so creepy.

17
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
I love being called Ojousama by Minto.

18
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,080
You are my Ojousama!

19
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,420
Or Goshijinsama.

20
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
Could be both.

21
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,680
I don't know.

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,920
Pick one.

23
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,900
Thanks for the five gifted!

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,520
Thank you!

25
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Yeah!

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,720
So...

27
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,020
More Metal Gear.

28
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,640
I don't know.

29
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm kind of blocking it, but it says like...

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,880
On the bottom right, it says like W.S.

31
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,220
As if I'm not playing on a controller.

32
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,660
Day two ago, I bought the collection and played through MGS1, but couldn't beat the final.

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
Too much trolling.

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
What do you mean too much trolling?

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,760
You couldn't beat Rex?

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,060
I believe in you.

37
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,960
If I can do it, you can do it.

38
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,340
Unless you mean...

39
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,120
No.

40
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,580
What?

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,360
No.

42
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,640
Probably the chase.

43
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
I was going to say, unless you mean the chase segment.

44
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,820
No.

45
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,980
Well today...

46
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,240
So I was... initially it was just like...

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,940
I'm going to play super duper long.

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,260
If I beat the game, cool.

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,580
If I don't, we'll save it for another day.

50
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,900
But I wanted to get close.

51
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,160
But now I'm thinking...

52
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,920
I was thinking, I was like, oh man.

53
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,680
I have a concert next week.

54
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,760
I should probably...

55
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,380
Not be doing super duper duper long streams.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,460
Just so I can protect my voice a little bit.

57
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,060
Happy Canada Day.

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,280
Oh Canada.

59
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,900
So...

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,040
Not to say that I won't go long.

61
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
But I'm thinking...

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
I don't know.

63
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,180
We'll go.

64
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,600
We'll just...

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,260
We'll just go.

66
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,160
And when I feel like it's an appropriate time...

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,940
I'm thinking maybe...

68
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,000
Like before Vulcan Raven.

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,720
Because...

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,820
Then once I get to Vulcan Raven, I think...

71
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,340
That's like a decent point...

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,060
After him...

73
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,480
To be able to beat the game.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe.

75
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,540
I don't know.

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,480
Maybe going things into Five Gifted!

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,940
Thank you.

78
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,040
So we'll see.

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,920
We'll see how far I get.

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,740
How well I do on some of these...

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,580
On some of these bosses.

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,560
And...

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

84
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,820
So...

85
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,740
Uh...

86
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,700
Yeah.

87
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,720
We'll just see.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,300
I'll just...

89
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,520
I'll just play.

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,700
And have a good time.

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,240
And hopefully you guys...

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,580
Have a good time too!

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,400
Talkers!

94
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,640
Oh!

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,020
Thanks for the Five Gifted!

96
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,920
Thank you!

97
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,380
Thank you guys.

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,260
You did really well last time.

99
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,860
I hope so.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,400
I want to go through the entire Metal Gear series.

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,620
Which games do I play after the first three?

102
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,440
Four!

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,580
One, two, three...

104
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,620
Four...

105
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,880
Peace Walker...

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,260
Ground Zeroes...

107
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,820
Five.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,460
If you're starting from there.

109
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,140
Yeah!

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,580
Pyro bug!

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,740
Thanks for that time!

112
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,640
Thank you!

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,260
Thank you!

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,860
So...

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,020
Um...

116
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,420
Let's see.

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,620
Uh...

118
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,220
For those who aren't sure.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,720
We stopped right before Psycho Mantis.

120
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,040
Um...

121
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,860
So we will be starting the stream with Psycho Mantis.

122
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,120
And I am playing on Integral.

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,900
Well done!

124
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,760
Thanks for the five!

125
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,560
Ready for her to scream.

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,100
Stop it.

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,420
No.

128
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,600
No.

129
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,600
I have to protect my voice.

130
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,400
Hahaha.

131
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,100
I have to protect my voice for...

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,840
Concert next week!

133
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,240
Psycho Mantis.

134
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah.

135
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,720
Psycho Mantis.

136
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,520
Hahaha.

137
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm playing on...

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,520
Integral?

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,840
Uh...

140
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,500
But it's in English.

141
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:15,940
Don't worry.

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Oh.

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,100
Maybe I should make myself a little smaller.

144
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,680
Like that?

145
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,500
Like that?

146
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,260
There we go.

147
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,920
Hahaha.

148
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,480
My sleeve is a little large.

149
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,280
And in charge.

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,380
Oh.

151
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,260
Oh my gosh.

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,140
Thank you guys for all the...

153
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,340
Super chats!

154
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,980
I remember this coming out and using my chore money to buy it.

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,540
Hahaha.

156
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,740
Oh my gosh.

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,180
I remember having to use my chore money to buy games too.

158
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,540
Before I forget, I was surprised to see Ayame Sensei's panel at ASEN.

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah!

160
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,380
Hehe.

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,540
Hope the spicy snacks didn't cook your gut.

162
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:48,940
Hahaha.

163
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you think Ayame would be interested in playing the Metal Gear series?

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,240
No.

165
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,280
Ayame Sensei is not really...

166
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
She doesn't really play games.

167
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,360
If I tell her...

168
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,620
If I tell her to play something, she's like...

169
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,180
I don't really play video games.

170
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,060
You know what?

171
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,400
That's okay.

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,260
Dog Strings!

173
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,280
Thanks to the five gifters!

174
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,860
Maple, welcome back!

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,380
We can watch this just to...

176
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,980
Archipelago.

177
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,980
How would a Balenciaga mint Metal Gear first?

178
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,220
Balenciaga!

179
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
I don't even know what Balenciaga looks like.

180
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,420
They're demanding that the government turn over the remains of Big Boss.

181
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,960
And they say that if their demands are not met with their demands, they will not be able to do so.

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,700
That's what I'm saying.

183
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
They will not be able to do so.

184
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,780
I know, right?

185
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:30,920
And what they are saying is that if you don't do so, they will not be able to do so.

186
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,960
And I will change the subtitles.

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,900
They will be in English.

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,660
So don't you worry.

189
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,560
Foxhound.

190
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,080
DARPA.

191
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,700
Kenneth...

192
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,900
Kenneth Baker.

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,220
Kenneth Baker.

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,080
Terrorist.

195
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,860
Kenny!

196
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,340
Bye!

197
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,920
Bye!

198
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,040
Bye!

199
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,300
Bye!

200
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,800
What's the insertion method?

201
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,340
We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.

202
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,080
How's the audio?

203
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,880
We'll launch a one-man SDV.

204
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
Kenneth Baca.

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,880
After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose it.

206
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
You smell like a Baca.

207
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
Thereon, you'll have to swim.

208
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,160
Kenneth Baker.

209
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,620
Is that it?

210
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:18,920
Okay.

211
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,900
I'm inserting.

212
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,060
I take special forces unit Foxhound.

213
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,780
Foxhound.

214
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,820
Your former unit.

215
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,960
And one that I was a commander of.

216
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Oh, I also want to say...

217
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,640
So they're still around.

218
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,820
Here, I'll type it.

219
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,620
There are six members of Foxhound involved in this terrorist activity.

220
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,020
Psycho Mattis, with his powerful psychic abilities.

221
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,260
Sniper Wolf, a beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

222
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,920
No spoilers.

223
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,040
Decoy Octopus.

224
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,540
Not for me, but for anyone who may have not played the series before.

225
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,860
Thanks.

226
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,300
Thank you.

227
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,440
And Revolver Ocelot.

228
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,080
I love that guy.

229
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
And a formidable gunfighter.

230
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,300
And finally, in charge of them, Foxhound's squad leader.

231
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Giant and Shamer.

232
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,000
Do you play the OG games on stream?

233
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,220
Yeah, probably.

234
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,500
I've played them before.

235
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,620
The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.

236
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.

237
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,200
Anyone going with me?

238
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Nope.

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,240
This is a one-man infiltration mission.

240
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,540
Sneaking mission.

241
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,620
Yes.

242
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,520
This is a top-secret black op.

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,540
Don't expect any official support.

244
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,900
Aw, man.

245
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,580
I need support.

246
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,900
At least I have Master Miller.

247
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,320
NES version?

248
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,940
Sure.

249
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,780
Yay!

250
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,360
Metal Gear Solid Integra!

251
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,180
Oh my god, I'm muscle-matching!

252
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,700
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

253
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Thank you!

254
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,680
Thank you, thank you!

255
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,240
So, let me make sure the subtitles and stuff are in English.

256
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,880
Caption on.

257
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,860
Vibration on, baby.

258
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,780
On, baby.

259
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,920
Okay.

260
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,200
That should be good.

261
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Wait.

262
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,440
Did it save?

263
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,860
Hold on, sorry.

264
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,840
Okay, good, good, good, good.

265
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,380
Okay, okay, okay.

266
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,760
Alright, so...

267
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,060
We're right before...

268
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,940
Right before...

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,720
Psychobiontis.

270
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,520
The nuclear building basement 1.

271
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,240
What is this one?

272
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Oh, did I only do two saves?

273
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,440
Okay.

274
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,300
Okay.

275
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,180
Okay.

276
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,790
Read mission log?

277
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,390
No, I think we're good.

278
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,850
But I do like seeing the art.

279
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,310
I can't believe Mint isn't playing in the optimal order of four survive, one rising, three, five, and then peaceful.

280
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,130
I know, right?

281
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,150
Blasphemy.

282
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,900
Okay, let's go.

283
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,740
Okay.

284
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,920
I know this place better than you.

285
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll be point man.

286
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,200
Follow me.

287
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,040
Okay, good.

288
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
So, that left us off right here.

289
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,000
We got to do the whole cutscene.

290
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,080
Okay.

291
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,180
With Meryl.

292
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,220
That's me.

293
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,020
In the mirror.

294
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,720
Man in the mirror.

295
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,380
I don't know how that song goes.

296
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,160
Just go look at her pants one more time.

297
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,560
Oh, yeah, baby.

298
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,560
Well, they probably smell like soldier, huh?

299
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,380
That's strange.

300
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,420
There's no guard.

301
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,200
And no music.

302
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,540
What happened to the music?

303
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,440
I'll keep a lookout.

304
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,280
Make sure you're ready, okay?

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,060
Okay.

306
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,180
Why do you have to say it like that, Meryl?

307
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,800
Why do you have to say it like that, huh?

308
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,110
What?

309
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,290
What is it?

310
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,270
What if I get really close to her?

311
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,270
Oh.

312
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:17,970
Wow.

313
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,510
Every pixel is visible.

314
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,370
What are you staring at?

315
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,210
She's getting red.

316
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,910
Get red.

317
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,490
Come on, Snake.

318
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,130
Come on, Snake.

319
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,510
Get a snake.

320
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,270
Get as red as your hair.

321
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,250
Wow, them pixels.

322
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,470
Don't stare at me like that.

323
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,910
Am I making you embarrassed?

324
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,210
What are you doing?

325
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:45,830
I'm being...

326
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,930
We've got to get a move on.

327
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm being so silly.

328
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,870
Look at all those pixels.

329
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,270
Yeah.

330
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,630
What?

331
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,850
What is it?

332
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,750
Get red.

333
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,250
Become a tomato.

334
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,490
What is it?

335
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,330
What are you staring at?

336
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm just, you know, your tomato body.

337
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,690
All right.

338
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,770
Let's see now.

339
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,550
I know that there's...

340
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,230
I can't go in there.

341
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:19,170
But I can grab the diazepam and the night vision goggles.

342
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,250
And, um...

343
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,030
And, uh...

344
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,410
Man, I sure love them torpedoes.

345
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,370
So calm.

346
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,470
So calm.

347
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,490
This is a ration.

348
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,490
I'm full on ration.

349
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,330
Oh, nice.

350
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:36,850
Okay.

351
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,990
Beep.

352
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,170
Beep.

353
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,370
Beep.

354
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:39,710
Beep.

355
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,070
Beep.

356
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,270
Beep.

357
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,430
Beep.

358
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:40,730
Beep.

359
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,380
Let's get all these things.

360
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
All these goodies.

361
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,100
Stun grenade.

362
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,440
No.

363
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,870
We're good.

364
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,950
That one...

365
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,890
Oh, I can go in here.

366
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,710
Cardboard box B!

367
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,310
Nice.

368
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,650
Okay, guys.

369
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,550
We're going to go in there.

370
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,470
Oh!

371
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,860
Yes?

372
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,020
What?

373
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,440
Wait, why is she running here?

374
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Hello?

375
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,640
Why did you come in here?

376
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,780
What?

377
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,170
Look how red she is still.

378
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,090
She heard you scream.

379
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,470
Okay, let's go fight...

380
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,670
a guy.

381
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,370
Oh gosh.

382
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,750
Beryl, I have to pee first.

383
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,370
Okay.

384
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,430
You ready?

385
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,590
Okay.

386
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,510
I like the way she like...

387
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,250
Wait, did you turn un-red?

388
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,650
No, I think it's just the lighting.

389
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,050
Okay.

390
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,430
I'm nervous!

391
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,270
I'm nervous!

392
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,270
Psycho Mantis was really hard for me before.

393
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,750
So I'm nervous.

394
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,210
Oh gosh.

395
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,190
Here we go.

396
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,750
I don't remember his patterning...

397
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,950
like his patterns at all.

398
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,430
Oh, I don't have...

399
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,810
Wait, I don't have full health.

400
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,350
Maybe I should go get the rations.

401
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,950
Snake, what are you doing?

402
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,690
Let's go to the commander's room.

403
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,730
But Meryl...

404
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,750
My health!

405
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:27,970
Meryl, please.

406
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,410
Understand.

407
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,010
Meryl.

408
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,790
Meryl.

409
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,510
Meryl.

410
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,810
Oh no, I'm not at full health.

411
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,470
Meryl.

412
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,430
It's okay.

413
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,410
I could always reload.

414
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,050
Here we go.

415
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,160
Ouch!

416
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,680
Ouch!

417
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,580
It hurts.

418
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,720
What's wrong?

419
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,480
Don't come here, Snake.

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I love this part.

421
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,440
Are you okay?

422
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,700
What happened?

423
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,000
Snake is not doing any...

424
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,680
What happened?

425
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,180
You good?

426
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm fine.

427
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,640
Okay.

428
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,380
Let's go.

429
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,260
I love this part.

430
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,980
I love this part.

431
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
Say the line.

432
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,000
Come on, Mr. Foxhound.

433
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,500
The commander is waiting.

434
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,080
Yeah!

435
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,420
I love that line so much.

436
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,820
It's so cool.

437
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,340
Come on, Mr. Foxhound.

438
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,120
The commander is waiting.

439
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh, boy.

440
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, boy.

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,300
Oh, golly.

442
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,900
Oh, boy.

443
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,260
Oh, golly.

444
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,860
Don't you...

445
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,060
Snake...

446
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,860
How do you like me?

447
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,920
What the...

448
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,840
Do you like me?

449
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,840
Hold me, Snake.

450
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,520
What's wrong?

451
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
Oh, hurry, hurry.

452
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,640
Don't fight!

453
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Psycho Mantis, you freak!

454
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,180
You don't like girls!

455
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,620
Why am I okay then?

456
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,660
Okay.

457
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,820
I'll knock her out.

458
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,000
Come on, Meryl.

459
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,580
Get it together.

460
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Come on, Meryl.

461
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,780
Get it together.

462
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,240
Get it together, Meryl.

463
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,960
Get it together.

464
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,760
Get it together, Meryl.

465
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,360
Meryl.

466
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,320
Meryl, get it together.

467
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,300
Meryl, get it together.

468
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,240
Meryl!

469
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,310
I mean, this man is floating, Snake!

470
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,470
What are you talking about?

471
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,630
You doubt my power.

472
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,050
This guy is floating in thin air!

473
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:30,390
Now, I will show you why I am the most powerful practitioner of psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.

474
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,550
In the world.

475
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,650
No, there's no need for words, Snake.

476
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,470
Yeah.

477
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,570
I am Psycho Mantis!

478
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,370
Yippee!

479
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,810
That's right.

480
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,170
This is no trick.

481
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,730
It's true power.

482
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,090
I can hear the mechanics of, like, the...

483
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,450
It's useless.

484
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:46,870
I told you.

485
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,510
...wiring holding him up in the ceiling.

486
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,410
Now, let me read your mind.

487
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:54,790
Oh, my God.

488
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,130
Now, perhaps I should say your past.

489
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,830
You are a very methodical man.

490
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,230
Mm-hmm.

491
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,470
The type that always kicks his tires before he leaves.

492
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:14,610
You are a highly skilled warrior, well-suited to this...

493
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,210
Stop!

494
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,830
Are you kidding me?

495
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,270
You are a highly skilled warrior, well-suited to this...

496
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,090
I'm a highly skilled warrior!

497
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,660
Oh, I'm a coward?

498
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,460
That's okay, too.

499
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,640
Now, don't believe me.

500
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,260
Oh, my God!

501
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,980
Now, I'll read more deeply into your soul.

502
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,520
I'm a gamer.

503
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,720
Ah, I can see into your mind.

504
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,780
What games do I like?

505
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,600
So, you like Suikoden.

506
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,840
You like Castlevania, don't you?

507
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,380
I like Castlevania.

508
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,700
You enjoy role-playing games.

509
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Role-playing games.

510
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,560
So, you like adventure games.

511
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,660
Ooh, yeah.

512
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,320
I see that you enjoy Konami games.

513
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,120
You have not saved often.

514
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,920
I haven't.

515
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
You are somewhat reckless.

516
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,960
I can read you like an open book.

517
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,840
You still don't believe me?

518
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,500
I will show you...

519
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,120
You thought I was safe scumming a little bit.

520
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,780
Put your controller on the floor.

521
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,120
Okay, I put it on my desk.

522
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,520
Put it down as flat as you can.

523
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,220
Yep, hold on.

524
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,760
That's good.

525
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,320
Oh, here.

526
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll put it here.

527
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,700
Now, I will move your controller...

528
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll put it on my desk.

529
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,400
Hopefully, you guys can hear it.

530
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,440
...at the power of my will alone.

531
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Here it goes.

532
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,840
My

533
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,740
power now.

534
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,820
Oh, my God!

535
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,420
It's moving!

536
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,460
A demonstration.

537
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,820
It's over.

538
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,480
Oh, okay.

539
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,280
Time to get serious.

540
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,780
Oh, gosh!

541
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,080
Oh, God!

542
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,780
Oh, God!

543
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, God!

544
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,020
No!

545
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,560
Alright.

546
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,820
Master Miller.

547
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,980
Help me.

548
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,860
It's true.

549
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,380
Your enemy is a powerful telepath.

550
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,000
But you've got more battle experience.

551
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,720
I do?

552
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,920
You can do it, Snake.

553
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Oh, my gosh.

554
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,880
He's so nice.

555
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,720
I love Master Miller.

556
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,140
That's Psycho Mantis.

557
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,740
Former KDB psychic.

558
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,060
He has powerful telepathic abilities.

559
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,120
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job.

560
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,800
He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.

561
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,940
Five years ago, he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer.

562
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,240
He got too far into the killer's mind.

563
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,000
As a result, he became just like the killer.

564
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,600
So he was sort of infected by the serial murderer's thoughts?

565
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,880
In any case, after that, he became a sort of psychic spy.

566
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,160
Psychic spy.

567
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,820
He traveled all around the world.

568
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,660
I love how this is all kind of retconned.

569
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,020
He can read people's minds.

570
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,580
He knows every move that you're going to make.

571
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,600
What should I do?

572
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,380
I've got no chance of beating him.

573
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,040
There must be some way.

574
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,700
He's a master at controlling people, Snake.

575
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,340
Don't let him manipulate you.

576
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,200
No Streamlabs notice?

577
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,580
They're probably blocked or backed up behind a bunch of gifters.

578
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,820
I see your donation, Paul.

579
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,460
Thank you!

580
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,040
Colonel, in which slot does the credit card go?

581
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,120
Thank you so much!

582
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,620
The order you're playing seems fine.

583
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,300
Wait, what are you waiting for?

584
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,660
Okay, here we go.

585
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,480
I don't feel like I need to save.

586
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Justasha, what do you have to say?

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,420
It's like a consultant.

588
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,140
Yes.

589
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,740
Although they will not admit it, many countries have paranormal programs.

590
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,040
I can't hear you over the music.

591
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,080
Justasha...

592
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,500
Psychics and their specialists...

593
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,740
Speak up!

594
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,820
Psychics range in power from those who gain bean spoons...

595
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,380
to those who gain commercial disasters.

596
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,820
...to those who gain commercial disasters.

597
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,000
But Psycho Mantis is one of the most powerful.

598
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,080
Be careful.

599
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,140
Meryl is on the ground.

600
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,700
Deep Thrill.

601
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,660
We know he was not going to respond.

602
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay.

603
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,980
Dun dun dun dun dun.

604
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:22,900
Okay.

605
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,980
Dun dun dun dun dun dun.

606
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,780
Okay, hold on.

607
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,020
Guys, I'm so sorry.

608
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,360
But also, we're just gonna...

609
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,620
controller connection connect as P2.

610
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,880
P has come to.

611
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,980
And...

612
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,580
Yes.

613
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I'm blind.

614
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,380
I know, me too.

615
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,940
Here we go.

616
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,880
Oh, gosh, I can't see.

617
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,560
Oh, God.

618
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,120
This is worse than anything.

619
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,880
This is so bad.

620
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Oh, my gosh.

621
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,020
It's so hard to see.

622
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,880
Dun dun dun dun dun.

623
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,740
And

624
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,700
rain.

625
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, this is...

626
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,400
Okay.

627
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,720
Crouch.

628
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,640
I can't...

629
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:30,980
Oh, God.

630
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I can't do this, you guys.

631
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,600
I can't do this.

632
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,820
Oh, my God.

633
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,020
It's so impossible to see.

634
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,180
Okay.

635
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,560
Okay.

636
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,180
Oh, that was close.

637
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,660
What?

638
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,060
What just hit me?

639
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,660
Are you kidding me right now?

640
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,920
What?

641
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,480
Oh, my gosh.

642
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:48,720
Wait.

643
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,040
Okay.

644
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
So, laying down...

645
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,220
What?

646
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,860
Wait a second.

647
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,300
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

648
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,960
I don't...

649
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,360
Uh-oh.

650
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,940
This is bad.

651
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,460
Eek.

652
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,340
Eek.

653
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,440
It's not even...

654
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,400
It

655
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,610
still hits me even when I'm laying down.

656
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,550
Okay.

657
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,630
That's good to know.

658
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,270
Oh, my God.

659
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,010
The chairs are poisonous!

660
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:17,750
What?!

661
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,430
Okay.

662
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,470
Oh, my gosh.

663
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,350
Where are you?

664
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,530
Get him!

665
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:26,730
Oh!

666
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,130
Okay, you guys.

667
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:28,890
This is not good.

668
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,910
Dude.

669
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,090
But I level...

670
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,030
I thought that the chairs couldn't get me if I lay down.

671
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,450
Clearly, I'm the only one who knows this.

672
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,970
Clearly that's not the case.

673
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,350
The poisonous chairs...

674
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,710
Can I still shoot him from here?

675
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,820
Oh, I can grab that ration.

676
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,200
Ouch!

677
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh, grab that ration now?

678
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,140
I can't reach you.

679
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh, that was close.

680
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,480
Get him!

681
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,360
Get his butt!

682
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,280
Get his butt!

683
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,640
I can hear him.

684
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,300
Oh my god.

685
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,180
Nice.

686
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,980
I got him.

687
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,720
Okay, nice, nice.

688
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
I can't remember his patterns at all.

689
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
Okay, now he throws the ball, right?

690
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,240
Oh, I ran right into it.

691
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Don't laugh at me.

692
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Don't laugh at me, Psycho Mantis, please.

693
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,140
I'm embarrassed.

694
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,530
Get him!

695
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,310
Get his butt!

696
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,190
Get his butt in front of you!

697
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,290
Okay, now I hide over here.

698
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,690
I can get him from here though, right?

699
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,610
Maybe I can't.

700
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,950
Nice.

701
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,350
Okay.

702
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,190
Okay.

703
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,070
These guys.

704
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,870
These guys are the bane of my existence!

705
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,410
Wow!

706
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,290
Run away!

707
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,890
Get his butt!

708
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,190
Oh my god.

709
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,250
Oh my goodness.

710
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,450
Ouch!

711
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,350
Ouch!

712
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,650
Get him!

713
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:30,890
Get him!

714
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,810
I think he was over here.

715
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,010
He disappeared.

716
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,130
And he's gonna throw a thing at me.

717
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,130
Oh, I'm out!

718
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,570
Oh my god, I'm out of bullets.

719
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,930
I'm out of bullets.

720
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,100
Why no famas?

721
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,900
I don't know.

722
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,660
He's gonna throw a thing.

723
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,550
Okay, chairs.

724
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,410
I can't reach.

725
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,110
Can I still get him?

726
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,570
I'm just shooting into them.

727
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,730
Shooting into them.

728
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,350
Ouch!

729
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,590
You dang statue!

730
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,470
Get his ass!

731
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,990
Whoa!

732
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,590
Ouch!

733
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,950
Ouch!

734
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,190
Ouch!

735
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,370
Ouch!

736
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:42,530
Ouch!

737
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:42,690
Ouch!

738
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,190
Ouch!

739
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,270
Ouch!

740
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:43,550
Ouch!

741
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:43,790
Ouch!

742
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:43,990
Ouch!

743
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,130
Ouch!

744
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,350
Ouch!

745
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:44,510
Ouch!

746
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:44,550
Ouch!

747
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:44,650
Ouch!

748
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:44,790
Ouch!

749
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:44,790
Ouch!

750
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:44,790
Ouch!

751
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,990
Ouch!

752
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,590
Ouch!

753
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,010
Ouch!

754
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,010
Ouch!

755
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,330
Ouch!

756
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:47,790
Ouch!

757
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:47,790
Ouch!

758
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:47,810
Ouch!

759
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:49,890
Ouch!

760
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:49,890
Ouch!

761
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:49,890
Ouch!

762
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,010
Ouch!

763
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,550
Ouch!

764
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:52,550
Ouch!

765
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:52,550
Ouch!

766
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:52,550
Ouch!

767
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

768
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

769
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

770
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

771
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

772
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

773
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

774
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

775
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

776
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

777
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

778
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

779
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

780
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

781
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

782
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

783
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

784
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

785
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,230
Ouch!

786
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

787
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

788
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

789
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

790
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

791
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

792
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

793
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

794
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

795
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

796
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

797
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

798
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

799
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

800
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

801
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

802
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Ouch!

803
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

804
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

805
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

806
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

807
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

808
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

809
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

810
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Ouch!

811
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,050
Ouch!

812
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,050
Ouch!

813
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,150
Ouch!

814
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,490
Ouch!

815
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:56,530
Ouch!

816
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch!

817
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch!

818
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch!

819
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch!

820
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch!

821
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:57,790
Ouch!

822
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

823
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

824
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

825
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

826
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

827
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Ouch!

828
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

829
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

830
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

831
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

832
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

833
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

834
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

835
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,850
Ouch!

836
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:57,870
Ouch!

837
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Ouch!

838
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Ouch!

839
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Ouch!

840
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Ouch!

841
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,410
Ouch!

842
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,130
Ouch!

843
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch!

844
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch!

845
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch!

846
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch!

847
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch!

848
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Ouch

849
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,980
Stop it, Meryl!

850
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,220
You're not yourself when you're hungry!

851
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,920
Oh god!

852
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,260
Oh god!

853
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,560
Oh god!

854
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,300
Oh god!

855
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,490
Come

856
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,300
on!

857
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,340
That was so cheap!

858
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:29,280
I don't know about this!

859
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,400
Oh shit.

860
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm literally running right into them.

861
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,600
Why

862
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,340
are you shooting so slowly, Snake?

863
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,100
I gotta get him.

864
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,360
Please!

865
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,160
Snake, run!

866
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,870
Why isn't it shooting fast?

867
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:37,650
Oh,

868
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,090
that was close.

869
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,330
Ay ay ay ay!

870
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,660
Oh no!

871
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,840
You guys, this might be the first one that I have to redo.

872
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,500
This might be the first one I have to redo.

873
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,060
Turn around.

874
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,620
No!

875
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,710
The chairs!

876
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,190
Where is he?

877
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,950
I'm just gonna shoot.

878
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,650
I'm gonna shoot.

879
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,590
I'm just gonna shoot.

880
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:47,730
I'm just gonna shoot.

881
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,290
I'll get you somehow!

882
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,790
Mantis!

883
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,690
Oh my god.

884
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,050
I hate those little guys.

885
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,990
I hate them so much.

886
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,530
Oh my god!

887
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:07,670
Oh

888
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,490
my god!

889
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:18,830
Please!

890
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,670
Shut up!

891
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,540
Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.

892
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,180
Thanks, Snake.

893
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,980
I owe you one.

894
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,600
Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing should wear off.

895
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,200
Right, Naomi?

896
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,280
When it's being a dream, for real.

897
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,480
Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?

898
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
For Campbell's sake?

899
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,680
Or maybe it's because you like her?

900
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,060
I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.

901
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,120
Oh, really?

902
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,940
Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?

903
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,700
Shut up, Naomi.

904
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,760
You're so dramatic.

905
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,280
It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people.

906
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,000
Real psycho Mantis.

907
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,920
That doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart.

908
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,960
It's okay, Colonel.

909
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,680
First try easy.

910
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,140
I know!

911
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,020
She's right.

912
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,520
Actually!

913
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,920
Oh my gosh, you guys.

914
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,720
Maybe I have improved as a gamer.

915
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
First try.

916
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,640
A strong man doesn't need to read the future.

917
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,100
He makes his own.

918
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,480
Perhaps so.

919
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,360
But I will read your future.

920
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,140
Showing her skills as a soldier.

921
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,120
As a gamer.

922
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,260
That's why he said I was a skilled soldier.

923
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,400
To Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.

924
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,510
You have to go through that hidden door.

925
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,250
The hidden door behind the bookcase.

926
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,550
The overland route.

927
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,490
It's blocked by frozen glaciers.

928
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,770
Go past the communication towers.

929
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,610
And use the tower's walkway.

930
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,950
You know what fight I always forget about in this game is the hindee.

931
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,910
Why are you telling me this?

932
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,590
I always forget about it.

933
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,950
I can read people's minds.

934
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:23,950
In my lifetime, I have read the past, present, and futures of thousands upon thousands of men and women.

935
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,370
Ugh, gross.

936
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,610
Oh, gross.

937
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:35,930
And each mind that I peered into was stuffed with the same single object of obsession.

938
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:42,090
That selfish and atavistic desire to pass on one seed.

939
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,170
It was enough to make me sick.

940
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:51,090
Every living thing on this planet exists to mindlessly pass on their DNA.

941
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,330
We're designed that way.

942
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,630
And that's why there is war.

943
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,250
But you...

944
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,310
You are different.

945
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,750
I'm not like other soldiers.

946
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,190
You're the same as us.

947
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,950
We have no past, no future.

948
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,790
We live in the moment.

949
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,650
That's our only purpose.

950
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,210
Humans weren't designed to bring each other happiness.

951
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,210
From the moment we're thrown into this world...

952
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,790
we're fated to bring each other nothing but pain and misery.

953
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,630
You're wrong.

954
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,490
The first person whose mind I dove into...

955
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,970
was my father's.

956
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,790
I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me in his heart.

957
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,390
My mother died in childbirth.

958
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,350
And he despised me for it.

959
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,810
I thought my father...

960
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,410
was going to kill me.

961
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,850
That's when my future...

962
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,670
disappeared.

963
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,690
I lost my past as well.

964
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,170
Everything on fire, baby!

965
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,830
The village was engulfed in flames.

966
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:11,670
Fire!

967
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,610
Are you saying that you burned your village down to bury your past?

968
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,570
I see that you have suffered the same trauma.

969
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,010
Ewww.

970
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,330
Sounds like me when I hear the girl's laugh.

971
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,230
We are truly the same.

972
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,490
You and I.

973
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,570
The world is a more interesting place with people like you and...

974
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,190
We're not like you, Psycho Mantis.

975
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,870
I never agreed with the boss's revolution.

976
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,110
His dreams of world conquest do not interest me.

977
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,750
I just wanted an excuse to kill as many people as I could.

978
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,130
You're a weirdo.

979
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:53,930
You monster.

980
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,710
Let him talk.

981
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,930
He doesn't have much time left.

982
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,090
I've seen through evil.

983
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,830
You, Snake.

984
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,030
You're just like the boss.

985
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,130
Let him cook.

986
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,830
Now you're worse...

987
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,490
compared to you.

988
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,490
I'm not so bad.

989
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,970
This guy sucks so much.

990
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,090
Poor Snake.

991
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,470
He doesn't deserve this.

992
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,750
He doesn't deserve this.

993
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,510
I let Caroline as well.

994
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,950
Meryl's...

995
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,270
You match my freak.

996
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,350
I saw you there.

997
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,550
You have a large place in your heart.

998
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,970
A large place?

999
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,350
A large place?

1000
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,410
Yes.

1001
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,310
A large place.

1002
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,910
But I do not know if your futures lie together.

1003
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,470
I have a last chance.

1004
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:44,530
I have a last request.

1005
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,190
What is it?

1006
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,070
My mask.

1007
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,110
Put it back on.

1008
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,030
Okay.

1009
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,610
Like this, other people's thoughts force their way into my mind.

1010
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,630
Before I die, I want to be by myself.

1011
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,450
I want to be left alone in my own world.

1012
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,650
He's like, reach for it.

1013
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,030
He's like, lift your head, buddy.

1014
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:10,910
Reach for it.

1015
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,930
I know you're dying.

1016
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,350
I want to find your future.

1017
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,550
Go through that door.

1018
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,940
This is the first time I've ever used my power to help someone.

1019
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,040
It's strange.

1020
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,880
It feels...

1021
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,520
Kind of...

1022
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,940
Nice.

1023
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,440
No.

1024
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,360
No life, no bullets.

1025
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,700
You knocked the heck out of Meryl.

1026
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
Let's go, Meryl.

1027
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,440
Thank you.

1028
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,840
Bye.

1029
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,860
I'm sorry.

1030
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,580
Meryl?

1031
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,780
How could I let Mantis control my mind like that?

1032
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,360
I know.

1033
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,040
How embarrassing.

1034
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,420
If you're gonna doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.

1035
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,880
You're right.

1036
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,660
Never doubt yourself.

1037
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,300
Just let it make you stronger.

1038
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,660
Learn something from it.

1039
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,860
You're right.

1040
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,940
I'm sorry.

1041
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,680
I won't do it again.

1042
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,040
The mirror being smashed.

1043
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,620
It's so sad.

1044
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,840
Snake, can I ask you something?

1045
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,560
What?

1046
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,360
What?

1047
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,480
About what Mantis said.

1048
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,040
I was just wondering.

1049
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,460
What?

1050
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,480
What's the problem now?

1051
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,420
I think what...

1052
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,780
Oh.

1053
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,220
I think the way Snake acts here...

1054
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,660
So, tell me, Snake.

1055
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,460
What's your name?

1056
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,560
I think what Mantis said really got to him, you know?

1057
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,540
Your real name.

1058
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,820
A name means nothing on the battlefield.

1059
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,500
He's just like, yeah, I am just a...

1060
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
Old enough to know what death looks like.

1061
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,240
...weapon.

1062
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,260
Any family?

1063
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,980
No.

1064
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,740
He's a bit shook.

1065
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,620
But I was raised by many people.

1066
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:48,900
Yeah.

1067
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,900
Is there anyone you like?

1068
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,820
I've never been interested in anyone you like.

1069
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,440
I've never been interested in anyone else's life.

1070
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,620
So you are all alone.

1071
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,840
Just like Mantis said.

1072
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,440
Say it.

1073
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,960
Other people just complicate my life.

1074
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,900
Say what you're thinking, Meryl.

1075
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,720
I don't like to get involved.

1076
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,380
Be honest.

1077
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
You're a sad, lonely man.

1078
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:09,940
Dang.

1079
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,760
Not that honest.

1080
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,820
Let's go.

1081
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,680
Yay.

1082
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,800
Defeat Psycho Mantis.

1083
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,240
Oh.

1084
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,580
Oh.

1085
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,920
It's saying to put it... change it back to controller one.

1086
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,380
Oh.

1087
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,880
Okay.

1088
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,440
Thank you, game.

1089
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,540
Wait.

1090
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:29,940
Yes.

1091
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,660
It's P1.

1092
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,200
There we go.

1093
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay.

1094
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,160
There we go.

1095
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,120
Okay.

1096
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
So I've basically exhausted all of my materials here.

1097
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,620
Can I...

1098
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,260
Oh, Psycho Mantis.

1099
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,780
Oh.

1100
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,160
Kiss.

1101
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,980
Wait.

1102
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,280
How do I get that angle again?

1103
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,880
Wow.

1104
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh.

1105
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,400
Yes.

1106
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,620
I know she's a pro gamer.

1107
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,360
Thank you.

1108
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,300
Can I go back now?

1109
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,120
Oh.

1110
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,940
That's not the door.

1111
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,040
What are you doing?

1112
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,940
We've got to get a move on.

1113
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,600
Meryl.

1114
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,980
There was rations back there.

1115
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,480
Meryl.

1116
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,080
You don't understand.

1117
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,020
I have...

1118
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,260
Oh.

1119
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,540
I have 29 bullets.

1120
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,520
I have 12 bullets.

1121
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,060
This is bad.

1122
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,120
It's fine, though.

1123
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,040
We're fine.

1124
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,400
Probably.

1125
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,240
I know there's a ration in here.

1126
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,620
Isn't there?

1127
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,460
Or there's stuff.

1128
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:33,880
Yeah.

1129
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,260
Okay.

1130
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,440
We got a little bit at least.

1131
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,260
Here we go.

1132
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,080
And then more bullets.

1133
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,500
Oh.

1134
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,480
Oh.

1135
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,560
Could there be wolves in there?

1136
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,560
Wolf dogs.

1137
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,100
Wolf dogs.

1138
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,640
Half wolf.

1139
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,640
Half husky.

1140
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,160
How do you know so much?

1141
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,120
I almost said dog wolves.

1142
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,400
I'm a musher.

1143
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm a musher.

1144
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,020
I'm a musher.

1145
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,100
I love...

1146
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,640
I'll take point.

1147
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,600
Snake, you follow me.

1148
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,080
Okay.

1149
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,800
Don't leave me behind, though.

1150
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,280
Meryl.

1151
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,580
That would be really rude of you.

1152
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:06,840
Okay.

1153
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,380
Girlie.

1154
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,460
Don't...

1155
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,200
Don't leave me behind.

1156
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,660
I believe you went this way.

1157
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,760
Don't leave me behind.

1158
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,180
It would be really, really, really rude of you.

1159
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,320
Nice.

1160
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,800
Oh.

1161
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,340
Oh.

1162
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,000
You bitch.

1163
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,260
You bitch.

1164
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,720
You bitch.

1165
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,100
You bitch.

1166
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,020
You bitch.

1167
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:28,880
Oh.

1168
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,020
There's more stuff down there, too.

1169
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,640
I never realized.

1170
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,860
Thank you.

1171
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,460
I'll take all that I can get right now.

1172
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh.

1173
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,200
Hmm.

1174
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,640
I don't want to kill the dogs, but...

1175
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,840
I could stun the dogs.

1176
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,460
But I only have three.

1177
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,000
We shouldn't waste them.

1178
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,190
I don't want to kill the dogs.

1179
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,670
What's that sound?

1180
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,850
The pups?

1181
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,030
The dogs walking around?

1182
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:05,970
See?

1183
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,430
Look.

1184
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,950
It's a dog.

1185
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,450
That's a full...

1186
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,370
That's a wolf dog.

1187
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,070
That's a full wolf dog.

1188
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:15,890
They won't...

1189
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,350
Will they bother me if I'm in the box?

1190
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,170
I can't remember.

1191
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,190
Awww.

1192
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:20,950
Little pup.

1193
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,090
Mushing makes me feel good.

1194
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,230
I can't remember if they bother me in the box.

1195
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:31,570
I do.

1196
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,230
I do.

1197
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,890
It's so hard to see in here.

1198
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,830
I'm just afraid I'm going to get lost.

1199
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,110
I got to get peed on first.

1200
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:41,970
Oh no.

1201
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,410
Okay.

1202
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:45,610
Inconvenienced.

1203
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,130
What do you mean inconvenienced?

1204
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,270
It's more like death.

1205
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,970
What are you talking about?

1206
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,390
Oh, actually, let's call people.

1207
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,590
Let's see what Campbell says.

1208
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,430
Yeah.

1209
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,070
Be careful.

1210
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,330
Wolves have the advantage in the dark.

1211
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,210
Not only can they see better, but they have a keen sense of smell as well.

1212
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,510
You'd better use your night vision goggles.

1213
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:04,890
Oh.

1214
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:05,970
Okay.

1215
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:06,970
Because...

1216
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,150
I'll only use it because Campbell told me to.

1217
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,890
You know, the Colonel.

1218
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,490
Don't suddenly look into the dark.

1219
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,870
Look slowly from a light area to a darker area.

1220
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:20,850
If you do that, your eyes will gradually adjust and you'll be able to see better in the dark.

1221
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,970
Try not to play in the dark either.

1222
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,170
Don't play in the dark, everybody.

1223
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,530
Snake, you saw the turn radar.

1224
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,070
Yeah.

1225
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,210
I saw it.

1226
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:32,370
I know.

1227
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,730
I can't use it in a narrow space like this, right?

1228
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,330
Right.

1229
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,270
I'm sorry.

1230
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,670
No reason to apologize.

1231
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,230
Even the greatest masterpiece has its flaws.

1232
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:41,790
Save.

1233
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,750
I'll save.

1234
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,150
Actually, no.

1235
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,350
I'll do a new one.

1236
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,390
Even though I don't want to go back and defeat Mantis again.

1237
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,610
TrueBrainRod is casually saying, I got to get peed on first.

1238
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,730
Like, that's a natural part of game progression.

1239
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,130
But it is.

1240
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:02,190
It is.

1241
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,330
I can't believe that you're doing this.

1242
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,630
Meiling, how did you get into this line of work?

1243
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,230
The truth is I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.

1244
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,150
I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.

1245
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:14,850
She's so cool.

1246
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,250
You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.

1247
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,190
But I didn't want to kill people.

1248
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,070
That's when I heard that the U.S.

1249
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,170
Air Force needed people to do BDA's .

1250
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,110
Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.

1251
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:28,890
Yeah.

1252
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,170
So I started to do research into aerial photography and accountability.

1253
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:39,970
BBL?

1254
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,150
No!

1255
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,650
She's so smart.

1256
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,890
I love it.

1257
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,650
Just casually.

1258
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,510
Isn't she like 16 or 17?

1259
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,490
She's like, yeah, I was gonna become a fighter.

1260
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,610
Like a, you know, a pilot.

1261
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,670
I was gonna...

1262
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,930
At her age.

1263
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,450
Meryl, can you come pick me up?

1264
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,630
I hate her.

1265
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,030
Okay, anyway.

1266
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,310
Okay, night vision goggles.

1267
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,090
Okay, there's no dogs here.

1268
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,600
Oh, he's gone.

1269
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:45,270
Oh!

1270
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,370
I'm trying to fight a dog.

1271
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,170
Hold on.

1272
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:47,690
Don't!

1273
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:47,850
Don't!

1274
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,990
Don't!

1275
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,330
Don't!

1276
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:48,870
Don't eat me!

1277
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,430
Don't eat me!

1278
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,480
Is it this way?

1279
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,960
I must punch the— I must punch the dogs!

1280
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,440
I must punch the dogs!

1281
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,300
Punch the– punch the— punch, punch.

1282
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,940
Punch punch punch punch.

1283
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,480
Punch punch.

1284
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,520
Oh, shit.

1285
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,280
Where is the area?

1286
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,220
Ow!

1287
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,160
I'm gonna die here!

1288
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,840
Because of the dogs!

1289
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,880
Punch the dog!

1290
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,300
Punch the dog!

1291
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,960
Punch, punch punch.

1292
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,860
Punch, punch, punch.

1293
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,920
Punch, punch, punch Don't eat me!

1294
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay, that's what I mean.

1295
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,230
Punch punch punch punch punch punch!

1296
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,370
Punch punch!

1297
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,810
Punch punch punch punch punch punch punch!

1298
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,230
This is actually an ideal scenario.

1299
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,690
This is the ideal scenario, you guys.

1300
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,610
Punch punch punch punch punch punch!

1301
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:47,810
Are they gonna...

1302
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,070
Go and disappear!

1303
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,330
Become little pixel people!

1304
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,150
Oh, no...

1305
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,570
Punch punch punch punch punch punch!

1306
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:57,490
Punch punch!

1307
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,650
Punch punch punch punch punch punch punch punch punch- ARGH!

1308
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,270
Get out.

1309
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,510
Punch punch, punch budge budge budge.

1310
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh my god!

1311
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,350
Why do you have so much!

1312
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,430
Is it here?

1313
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,150
No it's not.

1314
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,610
Get up get up snake.

1315
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,590
Oh my god!

1316
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,770
Oh my god you guys!

1317
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,410
I'm in danger!

1318
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,630
Where is the address?!

1319
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,310
Oh by somehow- go snake, go.

1320
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,210
Oh, I'm safe.

1321
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,110
I'm safe.

1322
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,270
Oh my god.

1323
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,710
Wait, this isn't it, is it?

1324
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,410
I got a ration, though.

1325
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:34,950
Ah!

1326
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,150
I can never find this damn exit!

1327
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,330
Die, Zizzapam!

1328
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:41,950
Uh-oh.

1329
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,160
They knocked me into the cave with the wrong one!

1330
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,600
There's just a baby looking at me!

1331
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:11,860
Okay.

1332
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,580
Wait, this other guy needs to go.

1333
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:16,680
Ow!

1334
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,140
Hey, hey!

1335
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:19,800
Okay.

1336
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,860
I think we can go.

1337
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,960
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1338
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,020
Ah!

1339
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,300
Are you kidding me?

1340
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,980
I hate you.

1341
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,800
I hate you, little dog.

1342
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,600
I hate you, little dog.

1343
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,420
Go, go, go!

1344
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,920
Stay, go!

1345
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,500
Please!

1346
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,340
Please, stay, go!

1347
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,300
Okay.

1348
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,620
Okay.

1349
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,090
This is so messed up.

1350
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,110
I thought the...

1351
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,070
Yeah.

1352
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,050
I thought so, too.

1353
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,830
This is so messed up.

1354
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,530
Meryl, they took all my rations!

1355
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,370
They robbed me!

1356
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,610
They robbed me!

1357
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,790
They robbed me blind.

1358
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,500
Come on.

1359
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,500
Give me piss immunity, please.

1360
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,880
What do I do?

1361
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,640
I have to hit her, right?

1362
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,440
Yippee!

1363
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,260
I fall!

1364
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,620
Thank you for the five gifted.

1365
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,820
Thank you.

1366
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,740
What are you thinking?

1367
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,840
I'm using my brain for real.

1368
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,940
What are you thinking?

1369
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,060
Okay.

1370
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,700
Anyway.

1371
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:33,940
Okay.

1372
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,220
We're all good.

1373
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,620
Kind of.

1374
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,540
Could be better, honestly.

1375
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,980
Anyway, let's just go.

1376
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,800
It's box A.

1377
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,680
It's box A.

1378
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,520
This place is mine.

1379
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,920
I'll take point again.

1380
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,440
Uh-oh.

1381
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,220
Stay back, okay?

1382
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,780
Wait.

1383
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,820
The radar is working.

1384
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,760
And since we can't use the mind detector either...

1385
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,040
Leave it to me.

1386
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,240
My mom is calling me.

1387
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,680
Mom, stop calling me.

1388
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,700
She actually wanted me to come see her today, but...

1389
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,600
Oh, I gotta pay attention.

1390
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,440
I'm just gonna crawl.

1391
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,320
So, what do you think?

1392
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Pretty good, huh?

1393
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,560
Pretty good.

1394
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,460
How did you know where the mines were?

1395
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,620
It sounds weird, but when Mantis dove into my mind, I was able to see where the mines were placed.

1396
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,800
And I can run straight to her?

1397
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,400
Are you impressed?

1398
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,160
You can, but I always manage to mess it up anyway.

1399
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,460
Only a little?

1400
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,740
Just run straight up.

1401
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,720
I always manage to get them anyway.

1402
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,880
It's okay, though.

1403
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,040
We'll just crawl and collect them all.

1404
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,340
Is that all of them?

1405
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,320
I think that's all of them.

1406
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,220
Right?

1407
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,820
I think so.

1408
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:42,980
Probably.

1409
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,660
Spee?

1410
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,040
Whoa!

1411
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,920
Merrill, they turned me into a Beyblade!

1412
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,840
Merrill!

1413
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,800
Okay,

1414
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,380
I think we're good.

1415
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,240
Anyway, don't get shot, Merrill.

1416
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,440
Merrill, what is it?

1417
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,960
Merrill, get down!

1418
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,920
We said get down, Merrill!

1419
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,720
Oh my goodness.

1420
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:42,560
Girl.

1421
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:44,960
Snake.

1422
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,280
Leave me and run.

1423
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,500
Merrill.

1424
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,100
Merrill.

1425
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:51,360
Yes.

1426
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,720
I am a rookie after all.

1427
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,840
Don't worry, Merrill.

1428
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,600
It's me they want.

1429
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,160
Even I know that.

1430
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,120
It's the oldest trick in the book.

1431
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,440
Yeah, pretty much.

1432
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,400
Trying to lure you out.

1433
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,800
Snipers just need for bait to lure you out.

1434
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,280
Merrill.

1435
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,100
Damn.

1436
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,600
Shoot me, Snake.

1437
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,380
No.

1438
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,060
No.

1439
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:11,220
My gun.

1440
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,480
I can't reach it by myself.

1441
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,960
Don't move.

1442
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,620
I promised.

1443
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,260
I wouldn't slow you down.

1444
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:28,370
I can still help.

1445
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,470
I want to help you.

1446
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,650
Quiet down.

1447
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:32,630
Save your strength.

1448
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,010
I was a fool.

1449
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,610
I wanted to be a soldier.

1450
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,150
But war is ugly.

1451
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,610
There's nothing glamorous about it.

1452
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,410
Snake, please save yourself.

1453
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,130
Go on living and don't give up on people.

1454
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,350
Don't forget me.

1455
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:56,750
I like this part.

1456
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,450
I like this part a lot.

1457
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,080
Now get out of here.

1458
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,180
Merrill.

1459
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,480
Damn.

1460
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,060
Snake.

1461
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,180
It's a trap.

1462
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,780
I like the ring when it's like all quiet.

1463
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,880
The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Merrill.

1464
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,680
And like Snake just being like, what do I do?

1465
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,260
What do I do?

1466
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:22,880
Don't do it.

1467
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,940
Must be Sniper Wolf, Foxhound's best shooter.

1468
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,540
Snipers usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh?

1469
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,760
I know her.

1470
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,680
She can wait for hours, days, or weeks.

1471
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,260
It doesn't matter to her.

1472
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,660
She's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself.

1473
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,600
Maybe so, but Merrill can't hold out that long.

1474
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,840
Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?

1475
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,820
She wants me to expose myself?

1476
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,280
There's nowhere to hide between here and the tower.

1477
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
She must be on the second floor of the tower.

1478
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,540
If Wolf is in the communications tower, she can see you perfectly.

1479
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,700
It's the classic sniper's position.

1480
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,840
Classic.

1481
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,100
At that distance, you won't be able to hit her with a standard weapon either.

1482
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,480
You'll need a sniper rifle.

1483
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,920
Colonel, take it easy.

1484
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,680
Take it easy.

1485
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,980
I'm gonna save Merrill, no matter what it takes.

1486
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,660
Okay.

1487
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,100
Thanks.

1488
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,480
What's wrong, Nail?

1489
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,140
Nothing.

1490
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,640
I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice yourself.

1491
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,900
You've got the genes of a soldier not to save you.

1492
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,100
I'm trying to save her.

1493
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,660
I'm only interested in saving my own skin.

1494
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,880
I wouldn't go that far, but...

1495
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,280
I don't know what the hell my genes look like, and I don't care.

1496
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,660
I operate on instinct, like an animal.

1497
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,880
I'm going to save Merrill.

1498
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,100
I don't need an excuse.

1499
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,880
She's so rude!

1500
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,900
And I'm not doing it for someone else, either.

1501
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,900
I'm gonna save Merrill for myself.

1502
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,100
You're so rude, Naomi.

1503
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,820
Girl, don't worry.

1504
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,860
Snake, thanks.

1505
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,660
I understand.

1506
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,120
I'm sorry.

1507
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,600
Okay.

1508
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,440
Um...

1509
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,580
Let's leave.

1510
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:57,660
Bye!

1511
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,540
Okey-dokey.

1512
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,450
Was there any other...

1513
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,450
What's it called around here?

1514
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,270
Any other places I can...

1515
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,620
Excuse me?

1516
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,000
What was that?

1517
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,960
You can leave.

1518
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,840
You can leave now.

1519
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,460
You can leave.

1520
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:40,260
I think if I get attacked by this dog without a ration on, I will actually die, so...

1521
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:41,900
Um...

1522
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,600
What's that?

1523
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:43,660
What's that?

1524
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,360
What's that?

1525
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,060
What's that?

1526
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,560
Oh my god!

1527
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,420
Please go away!

1528
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,150
Yeah, let's go back to Merrill real quick.

1529
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,930
That was really intense.

1530
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,390
How are you so good at that?

1531
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,530
Okey-dokey.

1532
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,170
Let's go through first.

1533
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,910
Surely the dogs are gone.

1534
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,630
Okay.

1535
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:22,610
Okay.

1536
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,650
Let's go through first.

1537
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,770
Oh, shoot.

1538
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:26,210
Ugh.

1539
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:35,740
Box.

1540
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,000
Okay.

1541
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,260
Ah, stealth is optional in this game, you guys.

1542
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,420
Stealth is optional.

1543
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,080
Is it?

1544
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,640
I don't actually know where the part or the area is.

1545
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,080
Oh, we got some bulls.

1546
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,420
Bullets.

1547
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,260
I'll take that.

1548
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:56,940
Okay.

1549
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:57,860
Thank you, little puppies.

1550
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,820
Thank you.

1551
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,520
I know you love me so much.

1552
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,060
I know.

1553
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,360
I know.

1554
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:02,980
I'm so cool.

1555
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,620
I'm so kakoi.

1556
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,200
I know.

1557
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:05,720
I know.

1558
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,200
I know.

1559
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,640
I know.

1560
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,100
You just really love me.

1561
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,660
I know.

1562
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,180
I know.

1563
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,640
Okay.

1564
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:11,820
Bye.

1565
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:12,680
Okay.

1566
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,380
Cool.

1567
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,660
Okey-dokey.

1568
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,780
We have to go all the way back, baby.

1569
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,720
To go get that P.S.

1570
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:25,860
G.

1571
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,760
Which...

1572
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,300
I can't remember exactly where it was at.

1573
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,140
I know.

1574
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:34,870
It's in the second...

1575
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,900
It's in the basement.

1576
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,180
Oh, thank goodness.

1577
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:40,840
Thank you.

1578
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,680
Thank you.

1579
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,160
Game.

1580
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:42,940
You're so kind.

1581
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,660
Game.

1582
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,420
You're so...

1583
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,520
Game.

1584
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,480
Oh, game.

1585
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:47,980
Oh, game.

1586
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,260
Sometimes you're so cruel and sometimes you're so kind.

1587
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,540
Ask Otacon?

1588
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,700
You're so right.

1589
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,120
Wait.

1590
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,380
Oh, shoot.

1591
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,500
What was Otacon's frequency?

1592
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,140
We haven't even called him once.

1593
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:01,820
Wait.

1594
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,820
What was Otacon's frequency?

1595
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,580
Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper rifle.

1596
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,640
Yeah, but where can I find a sniper rifle?

1597
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,920
I can't ask Meryl.

1598
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:13,820
Is it 14112?

1599
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:14,500
Okay.

1600
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,940
He's been on the base for a while.

1601
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,540
He might know.

1602
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:23,170
Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper...

1603
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:23,430
Yeah.

1604
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:23,870
Yeah.

1605
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:24,070
Yeah.

1606
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:24,150
Yeah.

1607
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,630
Yeah.

1608
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:24,990
Yeah.

1609
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:25,150
Yeah.

1610
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:25,930
Yeah.

1611
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:27,550
Yeah.

1612
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,770
Oh, there we go.

1613
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,570
Hi, Otacon.

1614
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,670
I was thinking that I was missing someone.

1615
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,130
Otacon, have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?

1616
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,510
A sniper rifle?

1617
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:37,810
Meryl's been shot.

1618
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:38,250
It is in the...

1619
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,230
I'm an extremely good sniper.

1620
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,510
It's where I didn't have to go before, but...

1621
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,790
Sniper.

1622
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,850
A high-quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight back.

1623
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:50,390
I saw a PSG-1 in the armory in the second-floor basement of the tank hangar.

1624
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:53,210
The second-floor basement of the tank hangar?

1625
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,650
I have to go all the way back there?

1626
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:55,270
Yeah.

1627
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,290
Well, yeah.

1628
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,530
What's wrong?

1629
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,310
What's wrong with you, Otacon?

1630
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:58,970
Hmm?

1631
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:00,470
Nothing.

1632
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:01,530
Nothing, eh?

1633
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:02,730
Yeah?

1634
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,290
You want to elaborate, buddy?

1635
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:06,730
Otacon.

1636
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:08,390
Okay.

1637
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,010
Hmm.

1638
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:10,790
Master?

1639
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,950
You need to make snap decisions.

1640
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,990
In war, the difference between living and dying is counted in milliseconds.

1641
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:18,870
Milliseconds.

1642
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:20,490
Okay.

1643
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,670
I don't think there's anything else in here.

1644
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,590
Nope.

1645
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,530
I don't think there's anything else in here.

1646
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,110
Oh my gosh, I keep thinking...

1647
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,490
I keep getting the door wrong.

1648
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,020
That guy is just peeing away.

1649
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:47,970
Pew!

1650
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,650
All righty.

1651
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,850
Let's go to...

1652
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,090
All the way back.

1653
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,380
I'm also a box.

1654
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,300
So glad nobody has to use this item.

1655
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,600
I'm also a box.

1656
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,380
Yep.

1657
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,860
We'll just wait for this guy to walk on by.

1658
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,240
I'm not even going to deal with him.

1659
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,540
I'm just going to go.

1660
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,760
We're going to...

1661
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,060
Wait.

1662
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,840
Now the field has...

1663
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,040
Oh, shoot.

1664
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,280
Wait.

1665
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,440
Now the field has cameras, doesn't it?

1666
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,080
Should I take the...

1667
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,740
Should I try for the...

1668
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,300
Okay.

1669
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,780
Hold on.

1670
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,440
Mei-Ling, I'm going to save.

1671
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,140
Save?

1672
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:40,500
Save.

1673
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,780
What can I do for you, Snake?

1674
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,820
Am I going to...

1675
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,620
Maybe I'll try and take the truck.

1676
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:02,120
In China, they say, rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many.

1677
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,440
Is she telling me not to take the truck?

1678
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,260
Snake, move forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger.

1679
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,620
You'll just have to play it by ear, depending on the circumstances.

1680
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:11,740
Okay.

1681
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:12,940
Oh, gosh.

1682
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,500
Okay.

1683
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,180
Oh,

1684
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:25,300
gosh.

1685
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,100
So, where the other guy is?

1686
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,900
Oh, okay.

1687
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:29,900
That was a camera.

1688
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,860
He should be coming around any second, I feel.

1689
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,660
I'm trying to look.

1690
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,780
There we go.

1691
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,420
Where is he?

1692
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, there he is.

1693
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,360
There he is.

1694
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:43,620
Okay.

1695
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:43,940
Don't move.

1696
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,360
Don't move.

1697
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,800
Don't move.

1698
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,200
Don't move.

1699
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,260
Don't move.

1700
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,000
Don't move.

1701
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,940
He's going to notice me, but he's going to say, just a box.

1702
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,520
He's going to go, huh.

1703
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:53,820
Just a box.

1704
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,280
Oh, gosh.

1705
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,220
You didn't even notice me.

1706
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,540
What a dummy.

1707
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,020
Oh, my gosh.

1708
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,880
You're an idiot.

1709
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,420
You're a dummy for real.

1710
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,040
Okay, it's kind of tight here.

1711
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,040
Never mind.

1712
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,860
Not nearly as tight as I thought it was.

1713
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,200
Just a box.

1714
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:38,840
Okay, cool.

1715
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,380
This is the right one, right?

1716
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:41,960
Yeah.

1717
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,540
Heliport.

1718
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:46,720
Cool.

1719
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,820
Just a box.

1720
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,900
Stinky.

1721
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,360
Smelly.

1722
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:49,800
Stinky.

1723
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,240
Really smelly box.

1724
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,640
Is this all there is to load?

1725
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,520
The heliport, huh?

1726
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,240
Yep.

1727
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,480
The heliport.

1728
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,440
Thank you.

1729
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,300
Yay.

1730
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,220
I love it.

1731
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:03,820
Twin snakes.

1732
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:04,320
It's so...

1733
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,060
You can see him so clearly in the box.

1734
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,980
Oh, stinky.

1735
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,820
Oh, this box smells so bad.

1736
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,300
What is the boss putting in here?

1737
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,340
Cool.

1738
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,680
All righty.

1739
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:19,800
There we go.

1740
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,080
This guy's not asleep anymore.

1741
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:21,580
Oh.

1742
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:21,820
Oh.

1743
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,480
Oh my god.

1744
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,360
Just a box.

1745
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,900
Just a box.

1746
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,960
Just a box.

1747
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:36,800
Just a box.

1748
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,040
Yeah.

1749
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,540
Go that way.

1750
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,660
Just a box.

1751
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,150
Is there anything under here?

1752
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,410
No.

1753
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:05,500
Okay.

1754
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,120
Okay.

1755
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,320
I'm sleepy.

1756
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,600
Does this guy come back around too?

1757
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,240
I hate that I...

1758
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,820
I know I can't use it in narrow spaces.

1759
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,700
Please don't notice me.

1760
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,540
Perfect.

1761
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:23,880
Isn't there...

1762
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,360
I think there's also rations in here.

1763
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,860
I didn't grab them earlier.

1764
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,920
I don't think so.

1765
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,540
Shadow Moses is E.P.'s soldier.

1766
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,000
So E.P.

1767
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,420
E.P.

1768
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:33,560
guy.

1769
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:36,920
Okay.

1770
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,140
I feel asleep.

1771
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:40,980
Yeah.

1772
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,240
We're going to gather some supplies, everybody.

1773
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,260
Okay.

1774
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,110
Second floor basement.

1775
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,010
I hate that area though.

1776
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:06,510
I hate it because there's the trap doors and also the guys.

1777
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,090
They always get me in there.

1778
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,230
Every time.

1779
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,470
How many rations do I have now?

1780
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:11,290
Two, I think.

1781
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,370
Three.

1782
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,210
Hi.

1783
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:14,450
Dog.

1784
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,070
Let's go.

1785
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:27,470
Meryl's incredible for surviving this long after being shot three times.

1786
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:31,790
I'm convinced that as soon as you leave, she...

1787
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,090
Sniper wolf grabs her and like starts treating her, right?

1788
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,590
Because when you come back, she's gone.

1789
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,490
So...

1790
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,030
Okay.

1791
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:42,730
I'm going to go.

1792
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,530
I'm going to go.

1793
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,910
I can't leave through this one.

1794
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:02,890
Nope.

1795
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,210
Got to be this one.

1796
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,070
Spoilers?

1797
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:10,250
Oh.

1798
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:10,870
No.

1799
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,810
I'm just saying.

1800
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:13,830
I think that's what happens.

1801
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,930
That's my...

1802
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,630
That's...

1803
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,010
You know.

1804
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,570
Don't...

1805
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,830
Don't trust me.

1806
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,590
Thanks for the hot dogs.

1807
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,370
Thank you.

1808
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:30,690
See you later.

1809
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:31,730
Is he upstairs or...

1810
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:34,250
I can't tell.

1811
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,970
The guy I'm hearing.

1812
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,550
Is he upstairs or is he over here?

1813
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,090
I can't tell.

1814
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,130
I guess he's upstairs.

1815
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,370
Hmm.

1816
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:50,230
Until so much MG has brain rot, she doesn't realize when she's spoiling anymore.

1817
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,630
No!

1818
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:52,610
Don't say that!

1819
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:54,190
No!

1820
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,570
Even me being like, don't spoil stuff, guys.

1821
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,630
Box time.

1822
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:12,270
Stinky.

1823
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,320
He was looking over here.

1824
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,120
Maybe not anymore.

1825
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,370
Beep!

1826
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,900
Was it B1?

1827
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,580
Or B2?

1828
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,320
Good luck, Min!

1829
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,040
Thank you!

1830
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,940
Wait, actually this will be a good place to grab some more supplies.

1831
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,680
Wait, can I go in here?

1832
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,560
Oh no!

1833
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,080
I only have five!

1834
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,240
This is six, isn't it?

1835
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,420
Is there like supplies in here anymore?

1836
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,560
Hello?

1837
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,140
Yes!

1838
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,480
Nice!

1839
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,280
Okay, now...

1840
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,940
I think there's another ration in here.

1841
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,940
But I'm gonna use this one.

1842
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,320
Which button?

1843
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:28,780
B button.

1844
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,560
Okay, there we go.

1845
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,140
Nice, nice, nice.

1846
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,160
Who's your favorite codec channel to talk to?

1847
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,880
I don't know!

1848
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,480
There's nothing under there, yeah.

1849
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,240
Callie Master Miller.

1850
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,440
Probably Master Miller.

1851
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,220
Oh.

1852
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,000
CQB!

1853
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,800
I hate Master Miller.

1854
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:02,400
It's CQC, Master Miller, you poser!

1855
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,680
Oh!

1856
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,060
Yeah, I knew that already.

1857
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,740
Campbell, are you okay?

1858
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,260
Are you freaking out a little bit?

1859
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,320
A sniper rifle in the second-floor basement of the tank hangar?

1860
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:20,620
Maybe.

1861
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,280
Go get it!

1862
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,260
And save Meryl!

1863
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,420
Okay...sorry.

1864
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:24,100
Oh...

1865
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,560
Okay.

1866
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,360
Sorry...

1867
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,440
He's like, ahm...

1868
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,140
Can you just do your job for 2 seconds?

1869
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,660
Yeah, it's right there.

1870
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,220
Nice!

1871
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,480
Okay, with this we're basically...

1872
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,880
topped off, which is great!

1873
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,040
Alright.

1874
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:50,540
My health is not a hundred percent, but it's pretty dang close.

1875
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,980
And we have four rations, so let me grab anything that's in here as well.

1876
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,600
Oh, what?

1877
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,360
They blocked it?

1878
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,620
Rude.

1879
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,760
Never mind.

1880
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,530
Second floor.

1881
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,610
They were having rat issues.

1882
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,530
Oh, yeah, probably.

1883
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,980
Every time it gets me.

1884
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,500
I think it's to the left over there, right?

1885
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,030
I think it's this room right there.

1886
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,570
I might be wrong, though.

1887
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:45,830
I might be wrong.

1888
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,650
I'm seeing how they walk around again.

1889
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:53,210
I don't remember.

1890
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,990
It says on the door.

1891
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,530
Yeah, but we looked earlier.

1892
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,390
I just can't remember.

1893
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:05,010
This guy down here just walks past... I think it has to be this one because he is constantly walk...

1894
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:05,450
Look at this!

1895
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,310
He's camping it!

1896
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,710
It has to be this one.

1897
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:13,390
This guy down here is completely camping.

1898
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,160
Oh, there's three guys.

1899
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:18,620
Okay.

1900
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,840
Oh, he's like... Wait, turn around and walk away, please.

1901
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,280
Okay, I'm gonna have to... I think I'm gonna have to choke him out.

1902
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,660
Wait, is this guy... This guy's gonna come down, right?

1903
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,580
Yeah, he goes down.

1904
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:48,900
He goes down that way.

1905
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,480
Okay, okay, okay.

1906
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,600
It has to be this one.

1907
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,920
Oh, gosh.

1908
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:54,500
Okay.

1909
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,080
I'm waiting for him to leave a little bit more.

1910
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:03,960
Okay.

1911
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,120
I think I'll be able to get him once he turns around now.

1912
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:13,640
Oh, shit!

1913
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,800
I had my weapon equipped!

1914
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,080
Just a box!

1915
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,300
Oh, no, but they're back.

1916
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:48,860
Okay.

1917
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,240
Is this a slidey... Wait, hold on.

1918
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,660
Where's my cigarette at?

1919
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,640
Oh, it's... Oh, it's awkward.

1920
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,480
Oh, it's weird.

1921
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,320
Okay.

1922
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,460
Let's... Let's unequip this.

1923
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,500
If I mess up...

1924
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,480
Oh, well... Just kill me.

1925
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,860
Just kill me.

1926
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,140
Just kill me.

1927
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,300
Just kill me.

1928
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,230
It's okay.

1929
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,450
We can start from this floor again.

1930
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,370
Like that!

1931
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,380
Okay, once this guy goes down, though, I can leave.

1932
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,020
If I mess up, he immediately messes up.

1933
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,280
Look, okay?

1934
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,060
Look.

1935
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:42,760
Look.

1936
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,960
I don't... I don't... I don't have any excuses.

1937
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,940
Oh, the thing didn't even go off.

1938
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:50,980
Okay.

1939
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:55,540
Unequip.

1940
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,580
Oh!

1941
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1942
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1943
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:58,640
Wait!

1944
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,160
My... My right trigger is not working, you guys!

1945
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,000
My right trigger is not working!

1946
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:03,740
Hold on.

1947
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,160
Um...

1948
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,440
Uh-oh.

1949
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,480
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1950
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,440
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1951
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,600
My left trigger is working.

1952
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,480
My right trigger...

1953
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,240
is not working!

1954
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,120
I have to unequip the box first?

1955
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,040
Are you sure?

1956
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,280
Okay, hold on.

1957
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,680
I just want... I know he can't see me.

1958
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,280
But I... I don't trust it anyway.

1959
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,680
Oh, you're right.

1960
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,940
Oh my gosh, you're right.

1961
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,360
Okay, it's fine now.

1962
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:36,500
Ugh!

1963
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,900
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

1964
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,280
That scared me so bad.

1965
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,320
Whew!

1966
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,280
Go, go, go, go, go!

1967
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:51,540
Oh, dang!

1968
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,660
Um, I'm also gonna...

1969
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,160
shoot at you.

1970
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,430
Don't call me!

1971
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:10,870
You got a PSG-1!

1972
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,370
Yes, I did!

1973
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,310
You can use that against Sniper Wolf!

1974
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:13,790
I'm gonna go!

1975
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:14,910
Hurry up and save Meryl!

1976
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,170
I'm gonna... I'm hurrying!

1977
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:17,890
Oh, uh, I'm hurrying.

1978
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:18,510
Yes, I am.

1979
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,530
Run, Snake, run!

1980
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,990
Oh, I can't get out of here.

1981
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:22,190
Uh...

1982
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:22,710
Ah!

1983
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,910
Just run?

1984
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:29,910
Oh my gosh.

1985
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,620
Uh, now I have to wait for the...

1986
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,220
Elevator!

1987
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,100
Please.

1988
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:40,700
Oh my gosh.

1989
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,710
I can't use it.

1990
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,250
I can't use it until I'm good.

1991
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,070
Goodbye, rations.

1992
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,610
Bye, rations.

1993
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,690
Why is everything against me?

1994
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:25,390
Huh?

1995
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,550
Just a box!

1996
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:27,910
You don't see anything.

1997
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:28,890
Don't turn this way.

1998
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,250
Oh, my goodness.

1999
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,070
Oh, God.

2000
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:36,960
Anyway, we're out.

2001
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:47,100
If that guy hadn't yelled for no reason, all he was doing was choking him, why did he yell about it?

2002
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,620
Stupid guy!

2003
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,320
Why did he have to yell?

2004
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,000
Oh!

2005
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,000
Oh!

2006
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,760
Why did he have to yell about getting killed?

2007
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,980
What an idiot.

2008
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,840
This should have been a really quiet, peaceful death.

2009
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,400
There's still a guy in there.

2010
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,440
Huh.

2011
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:07,960
Hold on.

2012
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,740
I'm waiting for this.

2013
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,020
I think he can't see me.

2014
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,070
I'm gonna un-equip my weapon too.

2015
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:17,670
Like a glove.

2016
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,070
Ugh.

2017
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,610
Okay.

2018
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:22,830
Let's go back to the heliport.

2019
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:23,650
Oh, there's a guy.

2020
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,070
Let's go back.

2021
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:25,390
How many rations info have left?

2022
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,390
Only two!

2023
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,660
I'm feeling like I should do it over.

2024
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:43,040
If only I hadn't messed up the alarm before.

2025
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,080
It would have been fine.

2026
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,520
It's all my fault.

2027
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,040
It's all my fault.

2028
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,460
If only I hadn't messed up the alarm.

2029
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,560
But it's so hard.

2030
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,980
It's so hard getting in there.

2031
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,840
That's such a tight squeeze!

2032
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,680
Oh!

2033
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,000
There will be more rations in the future.

2034
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,020
Yeah, I know.

2035
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,040
But I like having full rations.

2036
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,140
Wait.

2037
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:24,840
Oh, there.

2038
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,720
I was like, wait a second.

2039
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,140
Here, here.

2040
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,700
Just gonna chill out right here.

2041
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,940
Wait for these guys to walk away.

2042
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,960
And then we'll get into the car.

2043
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,000
What the heck was he doing?

2044
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,840
Not gonna turn around, are you?

2045
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,740
That's what I thought.

2046
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,260
Wait.

2047
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:24,520
And to the nuclear warhead building.

2048
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,160
Is this all there is to load?

2049
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:43,200
Maybe we can go loot the area with the gas.

2050
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,200
Maybe there's stuff in there too.

2051
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,920
We can go loot the area with the gas.

2052
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,220
I think.

2053
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,920
There's bullets and stuff over there.

2054
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:04,860
I need it.

2055
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,580
Chaff grenade.

2056
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,360
Nice.

2057
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,300
I think that guy went up.

2058
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:39,810
He doesn't turn around here, right?

2059
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:41,210
Yeah.

2060
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:42,750
Beep.

2061
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,140
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

2062
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:55,940
Wait, was it one or two?

2063
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,160
I think it was two.

2064
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:58,820
It was two.

2065
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:00,880
Oopsie.

2066
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:02,800
Hold on.

2067
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,200
We're gonna go loot a little bit.

2068
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,340
My guys.

2069
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,460
My bad.

2070
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:09,780
Okay.

2071
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,140
Here we go.

2072
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,020
Cause there's no one in here.

2073
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,400
There's only...

2074
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,460
Look, look, and there's...

2075
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,980
Look!

2076
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,120
There's stuff!

2077
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,100
I need it.

2078
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,420
I can chaff in here.

2079
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,060
Probably.

2080
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:31,500
And gas mask.

2081
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,000
And...

2082
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,660
Chaff grenade.

2083
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,740
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2084
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,560
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2085
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:43,840
Chaff!

2086
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:52,750
Chaff!

2087
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:55,990
Oh, yeah, blah, blah.

2088
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,010
There we go.

2089
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:58,610
Beep, beep!

2090
01:25:58,810 --> 01:25:59,670
More chaff.

2091
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:00,430
Nice.

2092
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:03,150
Chaff.

2093
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:03,930
If

2094
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:15,470
I take off the gas mask, my O2 just goes down faster.

2095
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:16,630
But...

2096
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:17,950
I need...

2097
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,750
Actually, can I...

2098
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,290
Is there stuff...

2099
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:21,470
I can't even tell if there's stuff in here.

2100
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:22,050
You know what?

2101
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:22,470
Let's just leave.

2102
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:25,510
This is good... enough.

2103
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,890
It's good enough.

2104
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,590
I don't want to waste too many chaff grenades either.

2105
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:38,010
Okay.

2106
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:38,810
Now let's go.

2107
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,810
Only some of the text is in Japanese?

2108
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:44,330
Yeah!

2109
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:47,790
Because Integral was never released for US.

2110
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:53,930
But you can change it to the text of the cutscenes to be in English and stuff.

2111
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:54,930
And the codex.

2112
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:58,790
But...

2113
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,750
Yeah, the text for the actual items are in Japanese.

2114
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:11,990
I will!

2115
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,050
I'm gonna go!

2116
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,390
Master, what do you think?

2117
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:22,430
If you can get out of a jam using just your hands and feet, then do it.

2118
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:25,370
If you can't, then go for the gun.

2119
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,110
Thanks, Master.

2120
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,310
You're so wise.

2121
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,370
This guy's trying to kill me.

2122
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,310
Don't give me the silent treatment, mister!

2123
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,030
What can I do for you, Snake?

2124
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:49,930
Campbell is like... she's related?

2125
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,790
She's her... it's his niece!

2126
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:52,590
That is related!

2127
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:54,930
By a little bit of blood.

2128
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:56,870
Tiny blood.

2129
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:58,510
Relation.

2130
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:04,750
Whoa.

2131
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:14,430
No, I'm cautious.

2132
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:17,630
Maybe a little overly so.

2133
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:18,230
Hahaha.

2134
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,510
Was there anything with the guy peeing?

2135
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,170
Does you give me... will you give me a ration?

2136
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,590
Oh, give me some bullets.

2137
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:38,970
Okay.

2138
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:42,970
Nothing in here.

2139
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,550
Dang.

2140
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,830
Oh!

2141
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:46,210
Oh!

2142
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:46,590
Oh!

2143
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,030
Oh!

2144
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:50,890
Guy was just peeing.

2145
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:53,050
Way too loudly.

2146
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,060
I do feel bad, like, taking him out when he is on the bathroom.

2147
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,260
Like... or on the toilet, I guess.

2148
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,800
Nothing... Oh!

2149
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,100
It does respawn!

2150
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,860
This place is amazing!

2151
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,540
Yippee!

2152
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,000
Does this stuff respawn here, too?

2153
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,980
Oh, Meryl.

2154
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,780
You were right over... Oh!

2155
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:37,950
You guys were all good!

2156
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:40,410
That's where she was.

2157
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:41,570
Oh my gosh.

2158
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:42,850
That's where she was.

2159
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,410
Oh!

2160
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,300
No dogs here.

2161
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,260
None, actually.

2162
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:56,520
We're good.

2163
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,980
It was box A.

2164
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,200
5, 6, 7, 0, 9!

2165
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:04,520
Au!

2166
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,580
Oh, uh, thank you.

2167
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,520
Love you, too.

2168
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,540
Oh, you're just one of my fans, huh?

2169
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:15,620
Yeah, one of my fans, one of my fans.

2170
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,640
Is it here?

2171
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,640
Oh gosh, wait.

2172
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,480
Hold on.

2173
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,680
No, no, it's...

2174
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:27,720
It's there.

2175
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,280
Okay, I'm gonna need you guys to, like...

2176
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,100
Get back a little.

2177
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,300
Here, let's lead him over here.

2178
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:34,940
Come here, come here.

2179
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,620
Oh, I'll take that, actually.

2180
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,220
That's pretty good to have.

2181
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,580
Come over here.

2182
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:43,800
Okay.

2183
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:44,860
There we go, there we go.

2184
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,020
Oh.

2185
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:59,390
We are following Mint Robot and Off Guy.

2186
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:00,750
Stop!

2187
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:03,290
Okay, good dog.

2188
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:04,090
Sit, sit.

2189
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,550
Good boy, good boy.

2190
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,510
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

2191
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:08,790
Sit, sit, sit.

2192
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:10,430
And sit.

2193
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,410
Good boy, good boy.

2194
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:11,890
Stay.

2195
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:12,890
No, no, no.

2196
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,350
Stay.

2197
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,390
Stay.

2198
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:15,650
Stay.

2199
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:15,970
Stay.

2200
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:16,810
Stay.

2201
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:17,210
Stay.

2202
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:18,490
Okay.

2203
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:19,330
Oh, shoot.

2204
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,770
Where is it?

2205
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:20,610
Here.

2206
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:24,950
Okay.

2207
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,450
Okay, okay.

2208
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:26,790
We're good, we're good, we're good.

2209
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,630
Nice!

2210
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,510
I always... I was gonna say, I always thought there was a rash in here.

2211
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,430
And there is!

2212
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:39,110
Okay.

2213
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:39,810
Very good.

2214
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:40,430
Alright.

2215
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,370
Time for a battle.

2216
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:43,150
Oh.

2217
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:43,810
Wrong button.

2218
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,530
Mei... Well, I guess it doesn't really matter, but...

2219
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:50,250
Yeah, I'm just gonna say, if I'm being caught...

2220
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:50,910
You know...

2221
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:53,670
Psycho Mantis kinda got to me, too.

2222
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:55,370
She said I was risky.

2223
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,050
I don't feel that way.

2224
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,230
I just wanna talk to Mei Ling more.

2225
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,030
Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission.

2226
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:05,650
Okay?

2227
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:06,870
Okay.

2228
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,270
Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper rifle.

2229
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,890
Okay.

2230
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:18,830
I'm not so good at this one, I think.

2231
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:19,790
Because the...

2232
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:22,250
It's hard to...

2233
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:29,950
I just feel like it's hard when she...

2234
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:33,370
is... Okay, we got the Diza as a Pam.

2235
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:34,830
Um...

2236
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:39,530
Alright, hold on.

2237
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:40,710
PSG1.

2238
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:47,990
It's always hard for me to get an angle here.

2239
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:48,790
I mean...

2240
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:50,750
It's...

2241
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:51,510
That's my...

2242
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,110
That's the toughest part for me.

2243
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,750
Is how to get the angle here.

2244
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,050
Without getting...

2245
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:56,190
Look!

2246
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:57,430
Without getting shot by her!

2247
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:00,430
Uh...

2248
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,330
Like, what is...

2249
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:02,690
What is the good strategy here?

2250
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:04,890
Like...

2251
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:06,570
Angel or angle?

2252
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,270
Angle!

2253
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,150
Like, what's the...

2254
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:08,610
What's the...

2255
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:09,270
What's the...

2256
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,350
Just raw dog it.

2257
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:11,110
No!

2258
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:12,630
Go further back.

2259
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:13,690
But she can see me.

2260
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:15,250
Right?

2261
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:17,370
She'll be able to see me back there.

2262
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,450
What's the best way?

2263
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:26,090
Just run out and aim quick?

2264
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,170
Oh, gosh.

2265
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:31,810
Spray and pray.

2266
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,530
That's not really an option here, is it?

2267
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:37,850
Press against the wall and you can see when she's aiming.

2268
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:40,590
You can.

2269
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:42,370
Oh!

2270
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,130
Look at this!

2271
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:44,750
She knows exactly where I am!

2272
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:45,630
Oh!

2273
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,530
She gave up.

2274
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:49,450
I thought...

2275
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,630
I thought she never gives up.

2276
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:54,010
I thought she'll be here for months, for weeks, forever.

2277
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:58,010
I thought she just lives and breathes this part, you know?

2278
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:01,190
She knows exactly where I am, though.

2279
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:02,390
Maybe...

2280
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:03,370
Hold on.

2281
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,590
When she turns around...

2282
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,650
Or when she gives up...

2283
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:07,790
I'm gonna run to the other side.

2284
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:11,690
Oh!

2285
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,330
She totally saw where I went.

2286
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:18,590
She totally saw where I went.

2287
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:19,910
Didn't even matter.

2288
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:20,290
Oh, my God.

2289
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,670
Is that...

2290
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,090
Are those the little rats upstairs?

2291
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:23,630
Do you see them moving around?

2292
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,330
They're so cute.

2293
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,270
They're just little...

2294
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:29,350
Actually, one pixels of rats.

2295
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:32,430
That's so funny.

2296
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,110
Okay.

2297
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:33,350
Okay.

2298
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,510
So, where was she at?

2299
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:37,550
Where'd she go?

2300
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:40,110
Okay.

2301
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:40,910
She's behind the pillar.

2302
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:41,210
Okay.

2303
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:47,310
Oh!

2304
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,010
Whoa!

2305
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:48,790
Whoa!

2306
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:50,050
It's so slow!

2307
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,050
Why is it so slow?

2308
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:51,730
Oh, it's because of me.

2309
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:55,850
Don't hit me.

2310
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:57,250
Don't hit.

2311
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:03,500
This...

2312
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,960
This one is so annoying to me.

2313
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:05,340
Again.

2314
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,460
Because it's like...

2315
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:07,720
How the heck...

2316
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,700
How the heck do I get to her?

2317
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:10,680
I don't know.

2318
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:13,360
Okay.

2319
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,820
Maybe I take a disazepam here.

2320
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:23,560
Shoot.

2321
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,240
Oh, shoot.

2322
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:24,620
I mean...

2323
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,440
I need to shoot.

2324
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:26,720
Where are you?

2325
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,480
Oh.

2326
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:33,320
There we go.

2327
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:34,460
You know.

2328
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,440
This time is the charm.

2329
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,080
Can I get her hand?

2330
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:38,340
No.

2331
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:39,280
Oh.

2332
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:40,560
Ouch!

2333
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:41,180
Oh, my God.

2334
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,060
Oh, my God.

2335
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,340
Denver.

2336
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,440
Hey,

2337
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:08,620
November.

2338
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:09,940
December.

2339
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,080
I just changed this.

2340
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:11,760
You missed our management meeting.

2341
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,040
Take that.

2342
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:14,140
Okay.

2343
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,460
Edit this.

2344
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,680
I wasởrn't I..

2345
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,520
Shut..

2346
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,820
Wait.

2347
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:23,260
Oh, I for..

2348
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:24,480
I'm sorry about this.

2349
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:24,960
You really...

2350
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,060
Stop shooting me!

2351
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,260
I'm trying to get into position!

2352
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:31,540
Yeah!

2353
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,380
Get out!

2354
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,120
Don't do it!

2355
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:43,560
Don't do it!

2356
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,460
Even if I can just get her...

2357
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,160
She missed.

2358
01:36:59,200 --> 01:36:59,600
She missed.

2359
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,120
Oh my god!

2360
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:07,940
How did that miss?

2361
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,540
I'm sorry!

2362
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:08,960
What?

2363
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,300
How did that miss?

2364
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,980
Come on.

2365
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,860
That was one pixel off.

2366
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,080
That's crazy.

2367
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,260
She's gonna run back.

2368
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:41,590
I just... I just got back here!

2369
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:46,110
If this is the battle I have to do again, I'm gonna scream.

2370
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:47,650
Where is she even?

2371
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:52,870
That was me.

2372
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,150
That was all me.

2373
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:57,290
I can't believe I did that!

2374
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:00,710
Oh my gosh.

2375
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:02,070
Sniper wolf, please!

2376
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,340
These controls... I'm trying to get as little of movement as...

2377
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,640
There we go.

2378
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:42,430
They're so awkward, the controls.

2379
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:42,790
I know.

2380
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:44,690
I got her too, though.

2381
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:46,190
I got her too, though.

2382
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,830
I only have three bullets left!

2383
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,270
Wait.

2384
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,180
Uh-oh.

2385
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,820
I only have three bullets left.

2386
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:01,880
Uh-oh.

2387
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,180
That's no good, is it?

2388
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:11,790
Make them count.

2389
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:13,030
Yeah, for sure.

2390
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:15,470
Three bullets.

2391
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:16,770
Okay.

2392
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:20,270
And not a lot of dis-dis-a-pam left either.

2393
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,030
Oh my god.

2394
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,090
I'm so slow!

2395
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:25,990
I'm so slow at turning!

2396
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,450
I just turned!

2397
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:32,870
Please, sniper wolf, please!

2398
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,390
Wait, where is she?

2399
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:36,770
Uh-oh.

2400
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:41,550
It's okay.

2401
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,410
It's okay.

2402
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:47,230
It's okay.

2403
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:48,130
It's okay.

2404
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:48,170
Okay.

2405
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:53,490
The controls here are so awkward.

2406
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:57,010
Alrighty.

2407
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,190
We got this!

2408
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:04,730
No need to worry about bullets.

2409
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:05,330
Yeah, right?

2410
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:07,830
So true!

2411
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,010
Okay.

2412
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:14,070
Alright.

2413
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:15,530
And, uh...

2414
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:21,730
Looks like you're redoing this one.

2415
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,990
Yeah, that's okay, though.

2416
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,270
I'm not gonna get all of them.

2417
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:25,110
Oh my gosh.

2418
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:25,970
Please, though.

2419
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:31,430
If I could just get in a decent angle when I, like, initially start, it'll save me...

2420
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:33,650
so much, you know?

2421
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:35,770
There we go.

2422
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:36,130
There we go.

2423
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:36,550
That's better.

2424
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:36,910
That's better.

2425
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:39,130
Okay.

2426
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:40,290
Where is she?

2427
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:41,690
Oh!

2428
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:42,130
Shoot.

2429
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:43,750
Oh my god.

2430
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,950
Don't shoot me.

2431
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:45,930
Don't shoot me.

2432
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,010
Got

2433
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:55,760
her?

2434
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:56,420
Okay.

2435
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,660
I don't know how I managed that one, to be honest.

2436
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,280
Sometimes her hitbox is...

2437
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:00,720
Ouch!

2438
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,060
Oh, I need to put on my rations again.

2439
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,350
Oh, shoot.

2440
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,170
No, no, no.

2441
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,590
Going to this side.

2442
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:17,030
How many bullets do I have?

2443
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,910
I clicked it.

2444
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:38,630
Come on.

2445
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:39,710
Show your face.

2446
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:41,370
Show your face!

2447
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:45,980
This side?

2448
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:46,940
What the hell?

2449
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,460
Got her?

2450
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:54,520
Aiming at her just a little bit.

2451
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:58,720
Oh my god.

2452
01:41:58,860 --> 01:41:59,400
There we go.

2453
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:00,680
Come on.

2454
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:04,560
There we go.

2455
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,700
Can't get me from here.

2456
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,540
What a shooting pose.

2457
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:18,930
Okay.

2458
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,430
That was a good position.

2459
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:20,970
Oh my god.

2460
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:24,170
I'm Beyblading again.

2461
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,890
Sniper wolf won't be able to hit me if I...

2462
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,010
Fly at her like this.

2463
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:29,450
Oh my god.

2464
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:29,830
Oh my god.

2465
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:31,890
Okay.

2466
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,190
Okay.

2467
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:33,050
All right.

2468
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,030
It should be good.

2469
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:35,350
Okay.

2470
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:36,190
And...

2471
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:38,070
Guys, it's Pam.

2472
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:41,690
Come on.

2473
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:42,190
Oh my god.

2474
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,850
Oh my god.

2475
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:44,810
Please.

2476
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:49,050
Please.

2477
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:50,830
No!

2478
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:53,150
I forgot to equip my rations again.

2479
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:55,310
No!

2480
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,970
No!

2481
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:56,230
No!

2482
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:56,590
No!

2483
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:56,870
No!

2484
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:59,690
Oh, it's the switching between it.

2485
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:01,190
I had her.

2486
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:01,870
I had her.

2487
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,470
It's the switching.

2488
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:06,110
Dang it.

2489
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:07,810
I forgot to.

2490
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:09,190
Oh, I forgot to.

2491
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:12,290
Dang it.

2492
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:18,750
This is...

2493
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:21,410
It's funny that this is the one causing me the most grief right now.

2494
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:24,010
And I say grief very lightly.

2495
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:24,670
Like I'm...

2496
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,690
I don't...

2497
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:26,310
It's only...

2498
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,650
Whatever.

2499
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:27,050
Oh.

2500
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:27,930
Can you get up, Snake?

2501
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:29,870
It's only the third time.

2502
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:29,990
I'll try.

2503
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:33,310
It's just a little bit annoying.

2504
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:34,850
Oh!

2505
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:36,030
Okay.

2506
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:37,230
There we go.

2507
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:38,450
All right.

2508
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:39,310
Guys, is it...

2509
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:40,270
Russian?

2510
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:44,150
Headshot!

2511
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:45,710
Headshot!

2512
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:46,710
Oh, dang it.

2513
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:48,810
Oh.

2514
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,130
Oh, she got me too.

2515
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:51,210
Oh.

2516
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:05,800
Oh.

2517
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:06,960
Run.

2518
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:07,220
Run.

2519
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,850
Shoot.

2520
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:16,090
Shoot.

2521
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:16,310
Shoot.

2522
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:16,450
Shoot.

2523
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:16,590
Shoot.

2524
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:16,690
Shoot.

2525
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:16,750
Shoot.

2526
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:16,790
Shoot.

2527
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,970
Shoot.

2528
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:17,190
Shoot.

2529
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:17,310
Shoot.

2530
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:23,490
No, stop.

2531
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:24,770
Let me get into position, please.

2532
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:25,910
Okay.

2533
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:28,450
Don't hit.

2534
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:28,790
Don't hit.

2535
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,930
Oh.

2536
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:31,830
Oh my god.

2537
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:40,990
Where is she?

2538
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,390
I think she's behind me.

2539
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:43,630
There she is.

2540
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:47,530
Yeah.

2541
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:47,850
Yeah.

2542
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:48,110
Yeah.

2543
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,730
I got you too.

2544
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,210
Oh.

2545
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:51,310
I got you too.

2546
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,370
No.

2547
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:00,590
Yeah.

2548
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:00,670
Yeah.

2549
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:00,750
Yeah.

2550
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,150
That's right.

2551
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:02,010
That's right.

2552
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:03,970
Can I get her from here?

2553
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:06,110
Yeah.

2554
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:06,310
Oh.

2555
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:06,810
Ouch!

2556
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,470
How did you get me even?

2557
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:19,350
It's just...

2558
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:22,330
Getting into position is so hard for me.

2559
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:24,810
Oh.

2560
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:25,950
She tried.

2561
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:26,430
She tried.

2562
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:27,550
Oh my god.

2563
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:27,830
Don't.

2564
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,070
Don't.

2565
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:28,270
Don't.

2566
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:28,490
Don't.

2567
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:28,670
Don't.

2568
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:28,930
Don't shoot.

2569
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:29,310
Don't shoot.

2570
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:29,590
Don't shoot.

2571
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:30,050
Okay.

2572
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:30,310
Okay.

2573
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:30,590
Good.

2574
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:30,750
Good.

2575
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:30,870
Good.

2576
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:31,550
Okay.

2577
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:31,750
Good.

2578
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:31,890
Good.

2579
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:50,980
Nice.

2580
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:55,400
Yippee.

2581
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,960
Are the cameras here yet?

2582
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,320
I can't remember.

2583
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:13,800
Take that.

2584
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,260
There's one what?

2585
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,280
One down here, right?

2586
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,860
Maybe not.

2587
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,300
Time to take a little bit of stuff.

2588
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,680
A little bit.

2589
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,160
Yippee.

2590
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:35,720
Take some what?

2591
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,460
Some bullets.

2592
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:37,700
Please.

2593
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:38,220
Thank you.

2594
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,120
I'll take that.

2595
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:39,480
Oh.

2596
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,240
What else is around here?

2597
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,280
Over there?

2598
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:42,580
Over there?

2599
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:45,140
I'm a gamer?

2600
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,360
I'm a soldier.

2601
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,380
Call Mei Ling?

2602
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:49,760
Oh.

2603
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,080
Mei Ling, I did it.

2604
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:56,500
Snake, wouldn't now be a good time to save your mission?

2605
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,240
What's going on?

2606
01:46:58,420 --> 01:46:58,660
Oh.

2607
01:46:58,660 --> 01:46:59,720
She's got a bad feeling.

2608
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,980
I'm getting a bad feeling.

2609
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:01,360
Oh.

2610
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:02,100
Bad feeling.

2611
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,280
Like a premonition or something.

2612
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,160
A premonition.

2613
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,520
She's so smart.

2614
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:09,480
Oh.

2615
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,280
Snake, it's all up to you.

2616
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,520
I love when she says that and there's no BGM.

2617
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:19,680
You just have like the...

2618
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,240
You know, you just have the wind and stuff.

2619
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,360
It's so creepy.

2620
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,460
It's so unnerving.

2621
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,740
Good job with Wolf.

2622
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,320
Is Meryl okay?

2623
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:28,400
I don't know.

2624
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,680
I don't see her around.

2625
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:31,660
You don't think she's been captured, do you?

2626
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,360
Could be.

2627
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:33,880
Let's ask Wolf.

2628
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:36,820
If she's still alive, I'm going to get some answers.

2629
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,080
Snake.

2630
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:39,340
Snake.

2631
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:39,880
About Meryl.

2632
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,440
I'm counting on you.

2633
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:41,800
Snake.

2634
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,320
Yeah.

2635
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:46,660
Master, what do you have to say about me being a gamer?

2636
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,520
Snake, divide and conquer.

2637
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,660
Try to take your enemies on one at a time.

2638
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:53,100
Okay.

2639
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,380
I haven't talked to Nastasha in a while.

2640
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:56,220
Let's see what she says.

2641
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,000
It is so ironic.

2642
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:03,120
People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used.

2643
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,420
She's once again off topic.

2644
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:06,260
Love that for her.

2645
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:07,760
Love you, Nastasha.

2646
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,440
Oh.

2647
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:13,130
Oh.

2648
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,030
He doesn't even talk to me at all.

2649
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:18,930
Come on.

2650
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:20,710
Come on, Otacon.

2651
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,390
Oh, I like the blood drops here.

2652
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:27,950
That's like a good attention to detail.

2653
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:31,870
That's so cool.

2654
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,010
And also the ones going down the stairs, so you could tell.

2655
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:36,810
I mean, she's not there.

2656
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:37,850
She must have escaped.

2657
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:38,830
Right?

2658
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:40,390
Hmm.

2659
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,210
Okay.

2660
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:42,830
Nastasha.

2661
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:43,170
Oh.

2662
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:43,270
Oh.

2663
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,030
Oh.

2664
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,870
I don't even have a level six key.

2665
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:52,070
I wouldn't even be able to get past.

2666
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,610
It's hard to miss when you're this close.

2667
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,070
Toss your weapon over here.

2668
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:59,390
Slowly.

2669
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:02,790
No.

2670
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:07,410
Don't take my weapon.

2671
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,230
You are a fool to come back here.

2672
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:10,930
Stupid man.

2673
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:11,990
Oh.

2674
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:13,110
Ladies.

2675
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:13,890
Sniper, huh?

2676
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:14,250
Oh.

2677
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:14,470
Ladies.

2678
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:14,850
Sniper.

2679
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:18,970
Didn't you know that two-thirds of the world's greatest assassins are women?

2680
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,770
You tell him.

2681
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:21,970
Do you want to die now?

2682
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:24,410
Or after your female friend?

2683
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,070
Ooh.

2684
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:25,770
Which will it be?

2685
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:29,450
I'll die after I kill you.

2686
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:30,030
Oh.

2687
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:30,950
Is that right?

2688
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,270
Well, at least you've got spirit.

2689
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:36,390
I am Sniper Wolf.

2690
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:39,610
And I always kill what I aim at.

2691
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:40,730
She is so awesome.

2692
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:41,150
Oh.

2693
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:43,270
You are a man.

2694
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:47,030
My special prey.

2695
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:50,710
I like how my controller vibrated when she grabbed my face.

2696
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,750
Oh.

2697
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:53,650
I've left my mark on you.

2698
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:56,170
I won't forget it.

2699
01:49:57,210 --> 01:50:01,610
Until I kill you, you're all I think about.

2700
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:02,770
Oh my god.

2701
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:10,060
I got knocked out by a lady.

2702
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:10,680
Take her away.

2703
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:12,660
Yippee.

2704
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,780
Can you be as awesome as Sniper Wolf?

2705
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:15,860
No.

2706
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,760
Can you be as awesome as Sniper Wolf?

2707
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:17,580
No.

2708
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:18,660
I don't think so.

2709
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:23,160
Don't kill me yet.

2710
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,560
I'm too alive.

2711
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,680
Leave it to me.

2712
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:27,480
Oh.

2713
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:27,880
Yeah.

2714
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,660
We're gonna leave it to you?

2715
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:30,360
Oh.

2716
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:30,800
I saw that.

2717
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:32,260
Yes.

2718
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,940
He's my target.

2719
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:34,540
Mine.

2720
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,820
Her accent is so beautiful.

2721
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:41,960
Oh.

2722
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,420
Hello.

2723
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:44,820
Oh.

2724
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:45,760
Oh.

2725
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:46,720
Hello.

2726
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:47,540
Oh.

2727
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:47,680
Oh.

2728
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:48,060
Oh.

2729
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:48,540
Oh.

2730
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:48,600
Hello.

2731
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,540
Here he is...

2732
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,140
dois snake.

2733
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,440
He's tougher than I thought.

2734
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,960
Do you know who I am?

2735
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:57,340
No.

2736
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,700
I always knew that one day I would meet you.

2737
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,300
Where are you?

2738
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:05,760
The man who stole what was rightly mine.

2739
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,760
The man who stole my birthright.

2740
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,800
If you mash too fast during the torture, it'll trigger the auto-firefly.

2741
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,440
I don't think I've ever mashed that hard enough.

2742
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,440
Forget it.

2743
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,440
Wow, you kinky man!

2744
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,480
Mia, I'm the man you stole everything good from.

2745
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,560
Oh, my eyes.

2746
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:34,380
And now, after the sacrifice of our brothers, after thirty long years, finally, the two of us meet.

2747
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,240
Brothers.

2748
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:39,940
The brother of light and the brother of dark.

2749
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:41,700
Brothers.

2750
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,940
Let me out!

2751
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,840
Do you need his DNA too?

2752
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,700
Yes.

2753
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:50,380
Ooh!

2754
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,520
I want a sample while he's still alive.

2755
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:57,500
We need it to correct the Genome Soldier's mutations.

2756
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,300
Then we'll be able to cure them.

2757
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:05,340
No, we still have to get our hands on Big Boss's DNA.

2758
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:07,680
They suffer from stupid...

2759
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,720
Hey, show yourself!

2760
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,060
Come on!

2761
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,000
Have they given in to our demands yet?

2762
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,580
Not yet.

2763
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,460
They won't give in.

2764
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,160
They're all hypocrites.

2765
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,820
Every one of them.

2766
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,240
Is that your opinion has occurred?

2767
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:26,540
They always put politics first.

2768
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:27,520
That's right.

2769
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:33,220
That's why they want to avoid any leak about their precious new nuclear weapon.

2770
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:36,660
Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.

2771
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:37,640
I've been awake!

2772
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,500
Oh, thank you.

2773
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:40,880
Oh!

2774
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,340
Hi, Liquid.

2775
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:49,620
There definitely is a resemblance.

2776
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,440
Don't you think, little brother?

2777
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,260
Or should I say, big brother?

2778
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,620
I'm not sure.

2779
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,740
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

2780
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:58,940
Who came out first?

2781
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,920
You and I are both the last surviving sons of Big Boss.

2782
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,120
It's me.

2783
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:07,860
Really?

2784
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,560
Then what?

2785
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,760
Those idiots!

2786
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,660
Uh-oh.

2787
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,640
All right, Raven.

2788
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,840
I'll be right there.

2789
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,370
They're not responding to our demands.

2790
01:53:20,530 --> 01:53:21,030
Oh, my God.

2791
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:23,070
We launch the first one in ten hours as planned.

2792
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,530
Damn Americans.

2793
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:25,410
Oh, my God.

2794
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:27,910
Looks like you read them wrong.

2795
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:29,850
Something's funny.

2796
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:33,230
Normally, the Americans are the first ones to the negotiating table.

2797
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:35,770
They must think they've got something up their sleeves.

2798
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:37,850
So it's come down to it, hasn't it?

2799
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:40,010
I was about to say, they think they have an ace up their sleeves.

2800
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:42,270
Going to launch that nuke and ride it all the way into history.

2801
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:44,470
I've got to take care of some launch preparations.

2802
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:46,410
You're in charge here, Ocelot.

2803
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:47,250
What about you?

2804
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,950
Want to stay for the show?

2805
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:50,530
I'm not interested.

2806
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:53,970
It's time to feed the family.

2807
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:56,770
She's got to take her dessert as a pen.

2808
01:53:59,110 --> 01:54:02,370
So you prefer your wolves to my show, huh?

2809
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:03,310
Yeah.

2810
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:05,850
Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the Chief.

2811
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:07,190
Yes, I know.

2812
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,470
That was an accident.

2813
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:11,970
I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough.

2814
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:16,350
Well, his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy.

2815
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:18,570
Boss, what about that mink?

2816
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:20,190
He's killed twelve men.

2817
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:22,250
But he died in the cell.

2818
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:24,690
Bastard took my hand.

2819
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:26,650
How could he have gotten in here?

2820
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:29,330
Perhaps there's a spy among us.

2821
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,290
Among us?

2822
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:34,570
We've also got to find out what killed Baker and Octopus.

2823
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:39,790
We're short-handed, so make this little torture show of yours as short as possible.

2824
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:40,830
I can't wait to fight him.

2825
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:42,390
This is an interrogation.

2826
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:43,410
As you wish.

2827
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:45,990
See you later, brother.

2828
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,160
Short-handed.

2829
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,540
Your woman is still in this world.

2830
01:54:58,880 --> 01:54:59,220
Merl.

2831
01:54:59,340 --> 01:54:59,800
Merl.

2832
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,840
Catch you later, handsome.

2833
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:09,860
Once she picks a target, she doesn't think about anything else.

2834
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,580
Sometimes she even falls in love with him before she kills him.

2835
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,480
These camera angles.

2836
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,360
These camera angles.

2837
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,720
Finally, just the two of us.

2838
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:18,820
Just the two of us.

2839
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:19,540
How are you feeling?

2840
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,960
We can make it.

2841
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:21,120
Not bad.

2842
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,320
Cut a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.

2843
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:23,640
Try.

2844
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,080
Too bad I was sleeping alone.

2845
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,840
Glad to hear that.

2846
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,420
This is some bed, all right.

2847
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,880
I'm about to show you some of its nicer features.

2848
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,900
Snake, you little flirt.

2849
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,260
Flirt with anyone that moves.

2850
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:34,640
Oh, don't worry.

2851
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:34,880
They're all there.

2852
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,760
Washington was taking quite a chance sending you here.

2853
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,940
Someone must have had a lot of faith in your skill, huh, carrier boy?

2854
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:43,860
Carrier boy.

2855
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:49,900
So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh?

2856
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,780
Why don't you go ask Campbell for the full story?

2857
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:53,640
Colonel?

2858
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:54,680
The Colonel?

2859
01:55:55,460 --> 01:56:00,080
By the way, you got an optical disc from President Baker, didn't you?

2860
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,560
What if I did?

2861
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,460
Is that the only disc?

2862
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,320
There's no other data?

2863
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,200
What do you mean?

2864
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,700
There's no copy?

2865
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:09,940
If not, that's fine.

2866
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,580
Is Meryl okay?

2867
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,440
I don't even know how to turn on turbo.

2868
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,760
Wolf must have been feeling generous.

2869
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,920
Maybe he wanted to stay that way.

2870
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,580
You better start answering my questions right now.

2871
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:24,360
Okay.

2872
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:26,900
You were holding one card key.

2873
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:27,380
Yeah.

2874
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:28,300
Where are the other two?

2875
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,500
What's the trick behind that key?

2876
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:31,220
I don't know.

2877
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:31,860
Trick?

2878
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:35,760
That weasel of a president said there's some kind of trick to using the key.

2879
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:36,180
Or treat.

2880
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,300
Well, if I know...

2881
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,440
I see.

2882
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,420
No problem then.

2883
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,720
We're going to play a game, Snake.

2884
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:44,280
A game?

2885
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,940
We'll find out what kind of man you really are.

2886
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,560
When the pain becomes too great to bear.

2887
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:52,240
Just give up and your suffering will end.

2888
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:52,880
Just give up?

2889
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,460
What if you do?

2890
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,520
The girl's life is mine.

2891
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:56,500
No!

2892
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,260
Are you going to fight or submit?

2893
01:56:59,360 --> 01:56:59,880
I'm going to fight.

2894
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,300
Press the circle button repeatedly to regain your strength.

2895
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:02,340
It says B even.

2896
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:06,160
When you've had enough, press the select button to select.

2897
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:09,440
I... I said in the, uh... Carol and talk.

2898
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,060
Hell no.

2899
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:29,840
I don't even think about using auto-fire.

2900
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,800
How do you even use that?

2901
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:36,160
W.

2902
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:38,100
You're a hostage.

2903
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,240
There's no Geneva Convention.

2904
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,100
No one is coming to save you.

2905
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,320
Starting to feel a little scared?

2906
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,200
No.

2907
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:46,700
Good.

2908
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,100
You should be.

2909
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:51,260
He doesn't even say anything hostile.

2910
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:56,480
I said this in the first stream of this.

2911
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:01,560
But because I'm playing through, like, the series...

2912
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,880
I, um...

2913
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:07,760
I decided that I want to play...

2914
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:16,290
The, um... the...

2915
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:17,170
How did you like that?

2916
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,030
True ending, rather, you know?

2917
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:19,990
Shall we go again?

2918
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:21,830
So that's why I'm gonna play it.

2919
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,740
Oh, my God.

2920
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,520
Hold on.

2921
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,480
I'm gonna put it on the desk.

2922
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:41,420
We're not finished yet.

2923
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:42,020
Okay, okay, okay.

2924
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:42,940
Okay, okay.

2925
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,740
Now it's not in my lap.

2926
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:46,080
Okay.

2927
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:00,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2928
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:00,880
My fingers.

2929
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:01,900
You're a strong man.

2930
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:03,740
Well, that's enough for now, huh?

2931
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:03,940
That will help.

2932
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:06,400
Thank you guys for the breeze.

2933
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,620
You're the boss's brother, all right.

2934
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,440
Your brother, he's an amazing man.

2935
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:16,360
Who else could shoot down two F-16s with a hind helicopter?

2936
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,660
The Les Enfanterie Project was not a total failure.

2937
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:25,200
He is the one man who could make my dream into a reality.

2938
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,500
Nice suit.

2939
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:40,240
Who's dragging me away?

2940
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,800
My stuff.

2941
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,080
Give me my stuff.

2942
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:48,240
Les Enfanterie.

2943
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,700
Looks like I got a roommate.

2944
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,080
Oh, gross.

2945
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:58,240
The DARPA chief.

2946
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:59,160
The DARPA chief?

2947
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,440
Why'd they keep him in here?

2948
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,460
What a stench.

2949
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,140
Nasty.

2950
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,180
Looks like he's been dead for days.

2951
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:14,840
Damn.

2952
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:16,840
I gotta go.

2953
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:18,300
That witch.

2954
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,460
That witch.

2955
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:20,000
She took my clothes.

2956
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,360
Shut up in there, will ya?

2957
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,020
Snake.

2958
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:44,780
Snake.

2959
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,240
Are you okay?

2960
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,160
I've been better.

2961
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,460
I love that he's naked in the codec.

2962
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:51,080
Damn.

2963
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,340
Snake, the government has decided not to give in to their demands.

2964
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:57,140
Yeah, I heard.

2965
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:58,340
We're trying to buy some more time.

2966
02:00:58,620 --> 02:00:59,020
Okay.

2967
02:00:59,020 --> 02:00:59,400
Come on, Colonel.

2968
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:01,500
Why don't you stop playing dumb?

2969
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,540
I'm sorry about Meryl, but I want the lies to end now.

2970
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:05,940
What are you talking about?

2971
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:09,940
Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?

2972
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:10,420
It was.

2973
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:12,660
You knew it all along, didn't you?

2974
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:14,600
Colonel.

2975
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:15,700
I'm so disappointed in you.

2976
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:16,600
Why did you try to hide it?

2977
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

2978
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:18,700
Colonel.

2979
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:20,000
Can't tell the grunts, huh?

2980
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:21,640
You've changed a lot.

2981
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,020
Metal Gear.

2982
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:25,400
Secret advanced nuclear weapons research.

2983
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,400
Does the White House know about this?

2984
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,620
How deep does it go?

2985
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:34,540
As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex project.

2986
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,220
Need to know basis.

2987
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,100
Is that the idea?

2988
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:38,800
These are sensitive times.

2989
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:42,640
Even subcritical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.

2990
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:44,720
Plausible deniability, huh?

2991
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:45,380
Yes.

2992
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:51,340
And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the START III accord.

2993
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,660
I get it.

2994
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,440
That's the reason for the deadline.

2995
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,040
That's right, Snake.

2996
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:59,260
And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.

2997
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:03,720
We still haven't even ratified START II, or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

2998
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:04,960
TMDs?

2999
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:09,640
This has to do with the President's reputation, and America's place as the dominant superpower.

3000
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:12,620
So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing?

3001
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:15,780
Yippee, more MDS!

3002
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:16,500
Thank you!

3003
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,380
Why should I?

3004
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,160
Because you're the only one who can.

3005
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:26,000
In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead.

3006
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:29,160
I told you before, I don't know the details.

3007
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,900
I don't believe you.

3008
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:36,100
If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?

3009
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:38,140
Let them have Big Boss' remains.

3010
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:39,420
You see?

3011
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,980
Or is there some reason that you can't do that?

3012
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:42,600
Snake, I don't know.

3013
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:42,680
What?

3014
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:43,520
What?

3015
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:48,160
Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.

3016
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:48,880
Right.

3017
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,900
You don't want the existence of the Genome Army to go public.

3018
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:53,900
And that's the only reason?

3019
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:56,700
Oh, come on.

3020
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:57,440
You coward!

3021
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:58,040
Hell with you.

3022
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,420
I'm sorry.

3023
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,160
You coward!

3024
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,800
The corpse of the DARPA chief is lying right here next to me.

3025
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:03,720
Oh, man.

3026
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:05,380
But it's strange.

3027
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:08,480
He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.

3028
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:11,000
All his blood's been drained out, too.

3029
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:11,620
Whoa.

3030
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:12,280
Drained.

3031
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:12,580
I'm sorry.

3032
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:14,520
Maybe to slow down decomposition?

3033
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,200
I have no idea.

3034
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:19,160
But the chief only died a few hours ago, right?

3035
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:19,940
Uh, yeah.

3036
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:20,400
Right.

3037
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,240
But he's already started to decompose.

3038
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:22,840
Weird.

3039
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:23,820
What could it all be about?

3040
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,000
Something in his blood that they wanted?

3041
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:27,380
I doubt it.

3042
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,700
Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.

3043
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:32,340
Did the chief tell them his detonation code?

3044
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:34,020
I'm afraid so.

3045
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:34,660
Apparently, yeah.

3046
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:37,720
It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.

3047
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:38,340
Dun dun.

3048
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,660
Is there any way to prevent it?

3049
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,560
It seems that there's some type of threat.

3050
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,740
Maybe there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.

3051
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,540
It's a countermeasure that Arms Tech installed secretly.

3052
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,200
Nanomachines.

3053
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:49,440
In his blood.

3054
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,760
You have to unlock it with three special card keys.

3055
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:53,260
And where are those keys?

3056
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:54,620
I've got one of them.

3057
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,980
Maybe there's a bisexual afoot.

3058
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,640
I don't know where the other two are.

3059
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,120
Besides, I'm locked up here.

3060
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:00,600
We've got no choice.

3061
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,000
Forget about the keys.

3062
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:06,080
Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.

3063
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:06,720
Okay.

3064
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,800
Sorry to have to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.

3065
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:10,560
Lost out of there.

3066
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,420
Well, maybe you should be more honest with me.

3067
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:13,160
I'm the one who's gonna destroy the Kishin's Tower.

3068
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:14,680
Also...

3069
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,400
What?

3070
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,620
You're asking for a whole lot.

3071
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:19,860
You're asking for a whole lot.

3072
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:20,000
Yeah.

3073
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:20,300
Colonel.

3074
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,660
I'll save her.

3075
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:23,240
Thanks.

3076
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,260
Wow.

3077
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,460
Wow.

3078
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,440
How's Master doing?

3079
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:34,720
Normally, when a soldier is taken prisoner, he should only give up the big four.

3080
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:35,440
The big four?

3081
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:38,340
That's name, rank, serial number, and date of birth.

3082
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:38,780
Oh.

3083
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,140
But you're not any old soldier, Snake.

3084
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:42,060
Why those things?

3085
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:42,520
I don't want to be a prisoner.

3086
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,620
I don't want you to tell them anything.

3087
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,180
Oh, okay.

3088
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,620
Fortunately, you're strong enough to resist.

3089
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:47,080
Yeah.

3090
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:51,440
Uh...

3091
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,320
Nastasha?

3092
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:58,600
Just because you are locked up does not mean there is no chance of escape.

3093
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:00,620
Keep your eyes and ears open.

3094
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:02,840
And when you see a chance, take it.

3095
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:03,700
Take it.

3096
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,880
Otacon, come get me out of here.

3097
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,320
Otacon, are you still okay?

3098
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:11,120
Yeah.

3099
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,420
Thanks to the stealth.

3100
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:12,500
I'm fine.

3101
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:13,540
It's a stealth camouflage, that is.

3102
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:15,020
I have a favor to ask.

3103
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,540
I need your help.

3104
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,380
I was wondering when you'd ask.

3105
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,740
What should I do?

3106
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:20,980
I've been captured.

3107
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,100
I'm locked up here in this cell.

3108
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:23,980
What cell?

3109
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:26,340
There's a big torture machine nearby.

3110
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:27,400
Okay.

3111
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:28,460
I know it.

3112
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,200
It's close.

3113
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,440
I'll be there right away.

3114
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:31,260
Why do you know this?

3115
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:33,200
Why do you know the torture machine, Otacon?

3116
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:33,900
Why did you...

3117
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:36,900
Okay, first of all, you were like, I think I'm making things for good.

3118
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,420
I'm making machines to be like my Japanese animes.

3119
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:42,500
But then you see the giant torture device, and you're just like, what?

3120
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:43,600
I was like, these are the good guys.

3121
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,460
Why'd you...?

3122
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,380
What's up with that?

3123
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,080
Bless you.

3124
02:05:57,400 --> 02:06:00,220
Shut up in there, will you?

3125
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,700
Shut up in there, will you?

3126
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:05,440
Shut up.

3127
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:09,140
Shut up.

3128
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,160
Shut up.

3129
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:11,700
Shut up.

3130
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:15,680
No kink-shaming.

3131
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:16,980
Sorry, sorry.

3132
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,500
I'm not kink-shaming, I'm not kink-shaming.

3133
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,560
I have to do it another time, right?

3134
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:24,380
To get... I want to try the ketchup.

3135
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,400
Shut up in there, will ya?

3136
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:30,660
Bless you.

3137
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:36,850
Shut up.

3138
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:41,310
Look at his... he's got such range for his vision.

3139
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:49,190
Sniper wolf in him, he used the torture device.

3140
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:53,350
It's showtime!

3141
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:56,790
Okay.

3142
02:06:58,650 --> 02:06:59,410
Alright.

3143
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:04,270
My finger has been given enough time maybe to recover.

3144
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:08,670
Okay.

3145
02:07:09,590 --> 02:07:10,350
Yes.

3146
02:07:14,350 --> 02:07:16,090
I will use it repeatedly to regain your strength.

3147
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:16,410
Okay.

3148
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:20,110
When you've had enough, press the select button to submit.

3149
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:24,430
When your life reaches zero, the game is over.

3150
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:27,110
There are no continues, my friend.

3151
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:27,890
And he means it.

3152
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:33,810
I've fought wars in Afghanistan, Mozambique, Eritrea, and Chad.

3153
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:38,290
Among the mujahideen guerrillas, I was known and feared as...

3154
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:39,290
Shamashaska.

3155
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:41,990
I was trained by the Russian rules.

3156
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:42,270
Hahaha.

3157
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:45,670
I am not like one of those KGB slugs.

3158
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:47,750
To me, this isn't torture.

3159
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:49,370
It's a sport.

3160
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:51,930
You're all just a bunch of sadists.

3161
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:55,230
Don't confuse me with those uniformed fools.

3162
02:07:56,070 --> 02:07:57,950
Oh my god, you're such a freak.

3163
02:07:58,230 --> 02:07:58,850
Shall we begin?

3164
02:07:59,250 --> 02:07:59,650
Okay.

3165
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:01,430
Shamashaska.

3166
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,010
Okay, here we go.

3167
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:05,790
Shamashaska.

3168
02:08:06,570 --> 02:08:08,030
Okay, here we go, here we go, guys.

3169
02:08:11,670 --> 02:08:12,230
Shamashaska.

3170
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:12,250
Shamashaska.

3171
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,970
You know

3172
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:23,770
why I think it's more difficult for me this time?

3173
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:24,210
How did you like that?

3174
02:08:24,570 --> 02:08:25,790
The buttons are bigger.

3175
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:27,010
Shall we go again?

3176
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:30,970
When I did it on the PS1 controller last time, it was so much easier.

3177
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:33,950
Because the buttons were more shallow.

3178
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:45,170
Had enough yet?

3179
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:48,430
We're not finished yet.

3180
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:48,910
Yeah.

3181
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:50,890
Okay.

3182
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:53,590
Here we go.

3183
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:54,850
Three.

3184
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:08,950
You're a strong man.

3185
02:09:09,630 --> 02:09:11,190
Well, that's enough for now.

3186
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:11,790
Thank you.

3187
02:09:12,150 --> 02:09:13,250
Thank you, Aslan.

3188
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:15,490
We live in a sad age.

3189
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:16,370
In a society.

3190
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:20,230
Imperialism, totalitarianism, perestroika.

3191
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:23,730
20th century Russia has had its share of problems.

3192
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:25,570
But at least they had an ideology.

3193
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:27,950
Russia today has nothing.

3194
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:30,650
They're struggling between freedom and order.

3195
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:34,030
And with that struggle, a new spirit of nationalism has been born.

3196
02:09:34,430 --> 02:09:37,550
The boss has a close friend high up in the Russian government.

3197
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:40,130
He's currently the head of Spetsnaz.

3198
02:09:40,170 --> 02:09:40,910
Who could that be?

3199
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:43,690
He's agreed to purchase this new nuclear weapons system.

3200
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:46,090
The hind was just a down payment.

3201
02:09:46,590 --> 02:09:48,250
So you're in this for money?

3202
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,570
I don't need money.

3203
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:51,970
I want Russia to be reborn.

3204
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:52,750
Yeah.

3205
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:54,690
To lead a brave new world order.

3206
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:55,050
Yeah.

3207
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:56,870
That's why he's doing it.

3208
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:57,150
No.

3209
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:02,390
We got you.

3210
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:03,830
We got you, Ocelot.

3211
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:06,190
We got you, Ocelot.

3212
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,260
Bye.

3213
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,120
So do I have to do it one more time or...

3214
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:17,560
Am I good now?

3215
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:25,210
I guess we wait for him to go to the bathroom right?

3216
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:26,790
Otacon, where are you?

3217
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:27,910
Otacon...

3218
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:29,870
I'm headed your way now...

3219
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:30,770
Can't you just relax?

3220
02:10:31,170 --> 02:10:31,990
This is life or death.

3221
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:32,950
I am relaxed.

3222
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:35,210
I just don't know how to kill time here.

3223
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:36,070
Okay.

3224
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,890
I'll be there as soon as I can.

3225
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:38,790
I am relaxed.

3226
02:10:39,150 --> 02:10:40,730
I am relaxed.

3227
02:10:43,470 --> 02:10:44,770
You okay, Snake?

3228
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:46,810
Yeah.

3229
02:10:46,810 --> 02:10:47,990
Nothing new to report.

3230
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:49,810
Three equals dead.

3231
02:10:49,810 --> 02:10:50,630
Is there anything I can do?

3232
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:52,250
Yeah.

3233
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:53,330
My arm hurts.

3234
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:54,490
Poor Snake.

3235
02:10:54,770 --> 02:10:57,110
I increased the level of painkillers in your blood.

3236
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:59,650
Okay, but you can leave out the Benzedrine.

3237
02:10:59,910 --> 02:11:01,750
That stuff makes me too frisky.

3238
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:04,950
I guess you're not feeling too bad after all.

3239
02:11:05,730 --> 02:11:08,330
Snake, put the controller up against your arm.

3240
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:08,730
Okay.

3241
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:09,290
What?

3242
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:10,510
Don't worry.

3243
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:10,850
It'll feel good.

3244
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:11,770
It's up against my arm?

3245
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,410
Huh?

3246
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:13,650
Okay.

3247
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:14,530
Here I go.

3248
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:19,110
That felt good.

3249
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:20,830
How does it feel, Snake?

3250
02:11:20,910 --> 02:11:21,710
A little better?

3251
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:22,190
Yeah.

3252
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:22,890
How did you do that?

3253
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:26,670
I stimulated your muscle fibers with the nanomachine cilia.

3254
02:11:26,810 --> 02:11:27,270
Wow.

3255
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:28,870
That's about all I can do for you.

3256
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:31,730
Naomi, please talk to me.

3257
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:34,710
Say something to take my mind off the pain.

3258
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:35,910
This guy.

3259
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:36,550
What can I say?

3260
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:37,430
This guy.

3261
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:37,830
Anything.

3262
02:11:39,390 --> 02:11:41,650
I... I'm not a very good talker.

3263
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:42,750
Naomi, please.

3264
02:11:43,330 --> 02:11:44,610
Tell me about yourself.

3265
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:45,650
Myself?

3266
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:48,050
That's a tough one.

3267
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:49,370
Any family?

3268
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:53,490
That's not a happy topic for me.

3269
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:55,770
I don't have any family.

3270
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:57,030
No.

3271
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:58,070
Wait.

3272
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:00,950
There was a man who said he was my father.

3273
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:02,590
Where is he?

3274
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:03,830
Dead.

3275
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,490
By my own hand.

3276
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:07,150
Big Boss.

3277
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:08,330
Big Boss.

3278
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:09,030
What?

3279
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:09,890
Big Boss?

3280
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:11,750
I had no idea.

3281
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,370
There was no way you could.

3282
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:16,130
It happened in Zanzibar six years ago.

3283
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,390
Only six years ago?

3284
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:19,450
Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.

3285
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:21,590
He was so green back then.

3286
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,370
So, is it true?

3287
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:24,830
Was Big Boss really your father?

3288
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,670
That's what he said.

3289
02:12:27,390 --> 02:12:28,390
That's all I know.

3290
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:30,930
And you were able to kill him?

3291
02:12:30,930 --> 02:12:31,990
Knowing that?

3292
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,400
Yup.

3293
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:41,540
Besides, some people just need killing.

3294
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:43,240
That's petricide.

3295
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:45,780
Yup.

3296
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:48,060
That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.

3297
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,380
The one we share in common.

3298
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:52,880
Is that why you left Foxhound?

3299
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:56,480
Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while.

3300
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:58,400
And Alaska was the perfect place.

3301
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,180
Snake.

3302
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,260
I didn't have a real family either.

3303
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,960
Just a big brother who put me through school.

3304
02:13:06,660 --> 02:13:09,560
We weren't even blood related and he was much older than me.

3305
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:11,520
Where is he?

3306
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:13,860
He's dead.

3307
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:15,740
I'm sorry.

3308
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:18,540
Sorry, I'm messaging Matara at the same time.

3309
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:19,500
Snake.

3310
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,640
We're trying to figure out when to record.

3311
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:25,400
After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.

3312
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,200
Friends?

3313
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:28,100
Friends.

3314
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:28,720
Roy Campbell.

3315
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:32,660
You're still calling me friend?

3316
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:33,440
Barely.

3317
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:34,100
Barely.

3318
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,980
Barely.

3319
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:36,220
No.

3320
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:37,960
There was another.

3321
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,680
Frank Yeager.

3322
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:40,760
What?

3323
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,520
Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant.

3324
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,500
And the only member of Foxhound ever to receive the code name Fox.

3325
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,120
Grey Fox.

3326
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:53,460
I learned a lot from him.

3327
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:55,600
But... but... but...

3328
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,840
Didn't you try to kill each other?

3329
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,240
That's true.

3330
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,160
Grey Fox!

3331
02:13:59,180 --> 02:13:59,500
We did it.

3332
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:00,620
In Zanzibar.

3333
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:02,440
But it was nothing personal.

3334
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,300
We were just professionals on opposite sides.

3335
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:04,960
That's all.

3336
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:07,540
And you still call yourself friend?

3337
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,140
Hard to believe.

3338
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,820
War is no reason to end a friendship.

3339
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:12,400
That's crazy.

3340
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:13,220
That's insane.

3341
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,700
Oh no, it's the first time I've agreed with Naomi.

3342
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,540
He was being held a prisoner of outer heaven.

3343
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:20,600
But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.

3344
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:23,760
He was always so cool and precise.

3345
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,460
I was still green.

3346
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,960
And he showed me the ropes.

3347
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:28,540
You knew him well?

3348
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:29,920
No.

3349
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:32,480
We never talked about our personal lives.

3350
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:34,000
Sort of an unwritten rule.

3351
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,500
We just were buddies.

3352
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,620
We were war buddies.

3353
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,660
The next time I saw you on the battlefield, we were enemies.

3354
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,720
We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.

3355
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:41,340
Yeah.

3356
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:42,320
I did that once.

3357
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,900
I know it sounds strange to most people.

3358
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:46,520
But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.

3359
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:47,940
It's like a sport.

3360
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,080
You sound like Ocelot.

3361
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:52,020
We were wild animals.

3362
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,320
You're right.

3363
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:54,760
We are animals.

3364
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:55,780
Just dudes being dudes.

3365
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:59,100
So if you were friends, then how do you explain the ninja's behavior?

3366
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,240
I don't know.

3367
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:01,380
I don't know.

3368
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:03,660
It's your genes.

3369
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:06,480
They make you predispose towards violence.

3370
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:09,080
You really like talking about genes, Naomi.

3371
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:11,740
Why did you get into genetic research anyway?

3372
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,600
Gosh, you don't shut up about genes, Naomi.

3373
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:20,780
I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I am the way I am.

3374
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:22,380
Annoying?

3375
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,320
Yeah.

3376
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:28,340
I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.

3377
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:33,640
I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the brain.

3378
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:35,180
You can even find blank spots in that person's memory.

3379
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:37,360
Memory is stored in DNA.

3380
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:45,060
We're not sure, but we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.

3381
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:47,020
So what about my fate?

3382
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:49,020
You know my DNA is sequenced, don't you?

3383
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:50,360
Your fate?

3384
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,240
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

3385
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:54,840
Of course not.

3386
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,520
Of course not.

3387
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,340
You're a scientist, not a fortune teller.

3388
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,460
Why'd you say it like that, though?

3389
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:02,020
Why'd you say it like that, though?

3390
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:04,400
Can bromance bloom on the battlefield?

3391
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:05,820
Master!

3392
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,120
Don't say anything to tease or anger the person torturing you.

3393
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:12,720
If you make him mad, it'll be that much worse for you.

3394
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,660
You'll need to save your strength.

3395
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,100
I'm gonna tease him?

3396
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,620
Ooh la la.

3397
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,040
Otacon, where the hell are you?

3398
02:16:23,860 --> 02:16:25,200
I'm headed your way now.

3399
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:26,420
Can't you just relax?

3400
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:30,700
Where are you?

3401
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,240
Where are you?

3402
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:34,100
Hey.

3403
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:34,880
Hey.

3404
02:16:36,830 --> 02:16:38,160
Shut up in there, will ya?

3405
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:40,060
Shut up.

3406
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:40,940
Shut up.

3407
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:43,680
Oh no.

3408
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:48,840
Oh no.

3409
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,980
There he goes!

3410
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:56,880
There he goes!

3411
02:17:00,690 --> 02:17:01,080
Oh

3412
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:04,810
god.

3413
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:05,290
Okay.

3414
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:10,250
I'm glad this place is pretty soundproof, so...

3415
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:10,470
Oh?

3416
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:17,030
Hey.

3417
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:18,310
I'm here.

3418
02:17:18,450 --> 02:17:18,750
Hey!

3419
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:21,070
Oh.

3420
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:22,470
I can't see you.

3421
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,210
It's me.

3422
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:25,050
Otacon.

3423
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:25,930
Otacon?

3424
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:27,330
They even capture you.

3425
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:28,350
Hurry.

3426
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:29,470
Get me out of here.

3427
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:30,730
Get me out of here!

3428
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:30,950
Let me go.

3429
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:31,730
That hurts.

3430
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,710
Hurry up.

3431
02:17:32,970 --> 02:17:33,450
Yes.

3432
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:35,030
Is that how you ask a guy a favor?

3433
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:35,830
Oh my god.

3434
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:36,350
They're so close.

3435
02:17:36,690 --> 02:17:36,850
Let me go.

3436
02:17:38,090 --> 02:17:38,490
Jeez.

3437
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:40,590
It's like an animal's cage.

3438
02:17:40,670 --> 02:17:42,830
Why is everybody comparing me to an animal today?

3439
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:43,370
I don't wanna smell.

3440
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:44,830
Because of him.

3441
02:17:46,010 --> 02:17:46,410
Yeah.

3442
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:47,090
Stinker.

3443
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:48,190
Stinker over there.

3444
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,470
It's the Derpachief.

3445
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:50,890
The Derpachief?

3446
02:17:50,890 --> 02:17:51,690
You don't have enough to get me out of here.

3447
02:17:51,810 --> 02:17:53,070
I'll be laying next to him.

3448
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:54,070
The Derpachief.

3449
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:54,270
You bastard.

3450
02:17:55,890 --> 02:17:57,910
This lock won't open with a security guard.

3451
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:58,690
You killed Kennen.

3452
02:17:58,710 --> 02:17:59,950
You need a key like a soldier's cap.

3453
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:00,230
Those bastards.

3454
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:02,590
So what are you doing here, then?

3455
02:18:05,570 --> 02:18:07,230
I thought you might be hungry.

3456
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:09,650
If you need more food, I can bring some more later.

3457
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:10,290
Tiny ration.

3458
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:13,810
Also, I got you this level six card.

3459
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:15,830
It'll get you out of that torture room.

3460
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:16,150
Yes.

3461
02:18:17,570 --> 02:18:17,970
Here.

3462
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:19,090
Take this, too.

3463
02:18:20,110 --> 02:18:20,730
What's this?

3464
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:21,970
It's a handkerchief.

3465
02:18:22,330 --> 02:18:23,730
I got it from Sniper Wolf.

3466
02:18:23,970 --> 02:18:24,330
Why?

3467
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:26,870
I don't know why, but she's nice to me.

3468
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:27,630
Why are you giving it to him, though?

3469
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:29,210
Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.

3470
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:31,030
What does Otacon eat?

3471
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:32,450
I was taking care of the dogs here.

3472
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:33,970
After the terrorists...

3473
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:36,930
I guess if you're eating rations, putting ketchup on it could help, right?

3474
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:39,210
But Sniper Wolf stopped them.

3475
02:18:39,590 --> 02:18:41,650
She even let me feed them when I asked.

3476
02:18:41,910 --> 02:18:42,210
Aww.

3477
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:44,250
She likes dogs.

3478
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:46,450
She must be a good person.

3479
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:47,150
So true.

3480
02:18:47,290 --> 02:18:48,110
Please don't hurt her.

3481
02:18:48,550 --> 02:18:49,650
Wake up, you idiot.

3482
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:51,410
She's the one who shot Meryl.

3483
02:18:51,470 --> 02:18:52,170
She likes dogs.

3484
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:55,410
Well, that's all I can do.

3485
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:56,250
She likes animals.

3486
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:57,070
They're planning to launch a nuke.

3487
02:18:57,090 --> 02:18:58,210
I've got to stop them.

3488
02:18:58,550 --> 02:18:59,910
Then you have to get past the communications.

3489
02:18:59,910 --> 02:19:00,210
I'm going to have to go.

3490
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:00,670
I'm going to the communications tower.

3491
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:02,670
First, you have to get me out of here.

3492
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:03,570
Come on.

3493
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:04,470
I'm trying my best.

3494
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:06,950
That guard's got the key.

3495
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:08,330
You'll have to take him out.

3496
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:08,550
Him?

3497
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:09,490
Give me a break.

3498
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,650
I'm no soldier.

3499
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:12,510
I can't take anybody out.

3500
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:12,810
Okay.

3501
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:13,230
You have to.

3502
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:14,250
That's a lot to ask.

3503
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:14,670
I'll be killed.

3504
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:19,550
He's coming back.

3505
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:22,650
Oh, jeez.

3506
02:19:22,770 --> 02:19:23,730
He's coming back.

3507
02:19:23,970 --> 02:19:24,770
See you later.

3508
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:25,510
Bye.

3509
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:26,770
Wait.

3510
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:28,430
Okay.

3511
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:29,230
Catch up.

3512
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:30,190
Oh, jeez.

3513
02:19:30,210 --> 02:19:30,430
What?

3514
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:30,690
I don't...

3515
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:31,270
Oh, B button.

3516
02:19:31,470 --> 02:19:31,830
Okay.

3517
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,370
Here I go.

3518
02:19:50,430 --> 02:19:52,470
We're just going to not worry about this next part.

3519
02:19:52,570 --> 02:19:52,750
Okay?

3520
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:58,270
What the...

3521
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:11,390
We're just going to not worry about this next part.

3522
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:11,650
Okay?

3523
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:12,550
Oh.

3524
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:13,850
Oh my God.

3525
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:14,370
Oh.

3526
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:14,690
Come here.

3527
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:15,790
Come on.

3528
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:19,130
We're just gonna not worry about that.

3529
02:20:19,630 --> 02:20:20,650
What just happened.

3530
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:21,130
Okay?

3531
02:20:21,370 --> 02:20:22,010
Everything's good.

3532
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:23,690
We're just gonna...

3533
02:20:25,290 --> 02:20:27,810
We're just gonna not worry about that, okay?

3534
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:34,030
Everybody, it's fine.

3535
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:35,910
Everybody, it's all good.

3536
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,260
Where is my stuff at?

3537
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:49,230
Let's go get changed.

3538
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:53,070
Did you just kill Johnny?

3539
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:53,730
No, no, no.

3540
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:56,710
Hold on the bomb for a call.

3541
02:20:56,830 --> 02:20:58,590
Yes, I actually was going to mention that.

3542
02:20:58,670 --> 02:21:01,950
I actually was going to say, I know that there is a bomb in my inventory.

3543
02:21:04,830 --> 02:21:06,510
But, I'm going to hold on to it.

3544
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:11,250
For some funny cutscene, or funny codex stuff that I wanna see.

3545
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:13,290
Not funny, but some codex stuff I wanna see.

3546
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:20,370
To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the communications tower.

3547
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:22,010
On the north side of the cave.

3548
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:23,530
Okay.

3549
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:31,010
Now that you've got your stuff back, you should take a good look through it.

3550
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:35,170
If you're slow equipping an item in battle, it could mean death.

3551
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:36,090
Shush.

3552
02:21:37,750 --> 02:21:39,510
The future will be changed.

3553
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:41,090
You've created a time paradox.

3554
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:44,290
I said, everything's fine, you guys.

3555
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,150
Everything's all good.

3556
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:46,170
Everything's fine.

3557
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:48,450
So, you figured out what I had in mind, huh?

3558
02:21:48,450 --> 02:21:50,610
I can't believe it actually worked.

3559
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:52,770
He's such a genius!

3560
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:55,130
Oh, it was auto contact the whole time.

3561
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,480
Johnny has a really strong neck.

3562
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,120
Okay, um...

3563
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:08,560
What else is around here?

3564
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:09,820
I think we just gotta go through there.

3565
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,400
I gotta use, um...

3566
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:14,420
Is there anything in the bathroom?

3567
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:16,820
Besides, like...

3568
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:18,020
I hope it's clean.

3569
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:18,680
Please be clean.

3570
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:19,040
Okay.

3571
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:20,800
Okay.

3572
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:21,700
Um...

3573
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,660
Let's use a chaff.

3574
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:25,800
I only have nine, though.

3575
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:39,120
Only stinky.

3576
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:45,680
Definitely stinky.

3577
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:47,880
That was close.

3578
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:49,680
Ah!

3579
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:50,520
Okay.

3580
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:54,400
I think we got everything in here.

3581
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:55,580
Actually...

3582
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,360
Let's do that.

3583
02:22:58,280 --> 02:22:59,620
Let's take out...

3584
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:00,520
Let's grab this.

3585
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:04,680
Okay.

3586
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:05,720
Okay, let's leave.

3587
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:09,340
Alrighty.

3588
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:11,140
Okie dokie.

3589
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:15,880
Now we have to go all the way back.

3590
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:18,180
So much fun.

3591
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:19,920
It's my favourite part.

3592
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:23,380
Love, love, love backtracking, everybody.

3593
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,440
Backtracking my beloved.

3594
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:28,940
Wait.

3595
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:31,420
Is there a good way to get out?

3596
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:31,860
Do I have to get through these?

3597
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,360
It's like impossible, isn't it?

3598
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:40,980
Do I have to chaff here?

3599
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:45,780
Johnny is dead!

3600
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:46,620
Time paradox!

3601
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:54,860
It's totally possible?

3602
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:57,020
Oh!

3603
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:05,540
It doesn't see me as far as I thought it would.

3604
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:08,640
Okay, I did it.

3605
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,580
Easy peasy.

3606
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:21,130
Oh!

3607
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:28,610
I'm just gonna go, I think, through here.

3608
02:24:28,990 --> 02:24:30,870
Is it turned off now?

3609
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:35,530
At some point it gets turned off, doesn't it?

3610
02:24:35,810 --> 02:24:39,450
I think it's turned off!

3611
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:40,930
Yippee!

3612
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:51,740
I have to go to the bathroom real quick, I think.

3613
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:56,990
It's okay, it's not so bad.

3614
02:24:58,070 --> 02:25:00,170
Are the mines back, I wonder?

3615
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:00,930
I don't remember.

3616
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,450
Yes.

3617
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:06,650
This is why we always check.

3618
02:25:07,390 --> 02:25:09,710
This is why we're overly cautious.

3619
02:25:10,910 --> 02:25:13,290
It feels like there's even more than before.

3620
02:25:14,150 --> 02:25:16,850
I think they put in a ton of them.

3621
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:18,850
Oh my god.

3622
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:20,590
There's a ton and ton of them.

3623
02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:22,010
Oh my god.

3624
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:23,710
It's an absolute...

3625
02:25:25,530 --> 02:25:25,970
minefield.

3626
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:28,530
Craziness.

3627
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:31,050
Well, I can just run through it.

3628
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:37,390
Snake, there's a bomb planted in your items.

3629
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:38,890
Harry, throw it away!

3630
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:40,730
Who the hell are you?

3631
02:25:40,750 --> 02:25:41,490
One of them?

3632
02:25:41,730 --> 02:25:43,190
You'll find out soon enough.

3633
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,670
Okay!

3634
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:45,650
Oh my god!

3635
02:25:45,710 --> 02:25:48,010
What do you mean there's a bomb planted in my items?

3636
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:51,310
Colonel!

3637
02:25:54,770 --> 02:25:55,950
Oh, he doesn't care.

3638
02:25:55,970 --> 02:25:56,270
He doesn't care.

3639
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:00,530
A bomb!

3640
02:26:00,730 --> 02:26:01,150
A bomb!

3641
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,830
A bomb!

3642
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:02,310
A bomb!

3643
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:02,690
A bomb!

3644
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:06,970
Oh my god, I only have 60 seconds left on it.

3645
02:26:08,910 --> 02:26:09,950
Oh yeah, call master.

3646
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:10,790
I didn't know before.

3647
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:12,850
Let me see, if I call him after, I know there was something.

3648
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:15,030
No.

3649
02:26:15,050 --> 02:26:15,850
Cold environments.

3650
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:19,910
If you're going to use a handgun, you should equip a suppressor.

3651
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:21,110
Thank you.

3652
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:22,610
Okay, let's get rid of this bomb.

3653
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:25,290
Wait.

3654
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:25,910
Oh.

3655
02:26:26,390 --> 02:26:26,830
Wait.

3656
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:28,550
Wait, how do I get rid of it?

3657
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:30,130
Wait.

3658
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:30,870
Oh, there we go.

3659
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:31,670
Whee!

3660
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:40,990
That was a close one, Snake.

3661
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:41,910
That was a close one.

3662
02:26:42,210 --> 02:26:42,650
Ocelot.

3663
02:26:43,230 --> 02:26:44,390
You'll pay for that.

3664
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:47,090
That deep throat's a real enigma.

3665
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:49,690
He's definitely from inside their ranks.

3666
02:26:49,850 --> 02:26:51,070
Is he an informer?

3667
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:51,690
Oh.

3668
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:53,110
Maybe some kind of renegade?

3669
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:57,090
I've got the feeling there's some other force at work here.

3670
02:26:58,690 --> 02:26:59,830
Oh, wait, hold on.

3671
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:01,170
Master.

3672
02:27:02,830 --> 02:27:04,590
That was too close, Snake.

3673
02:27:04,690 --> 02:27:04,970
It was.

3674
02:27:05,350 --> 02:27:05,410
Yeah.

3675
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:07,810
That was quite a surprise, all right.

3676
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:10,350
Hiding a bomb in your items.

3677
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:12,170
That's a despicable act.

3678
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:13,630
He should never...

3679
02:27:13,630 --> 02:27:14,110
Oh!

3680
02:27:14,730 --> 02:27:15,210
Oh!

3681
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:17,530
You'd better hurry to the underground base.

3682
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:19,150
You're almost out of time.

3683
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:19,410
Oh!

3684
02:27:20,030 --> 02:27:20,510
Oh!

3685
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:21,150
Oh!

3686
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:21,670
Oh!

3687
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:22,890
He should never.

3688
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:24,910
He should never.

3689
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:26,870
Bless you.

3690
02:27:26,890 --> 02:27:27,350
Thank you.

3691
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:38,300
What do you mean by that, Master?

3692
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:39,740
He should never what?

3693
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:44,940
If you go straight down the underground passageway north of the cave, you'll arrive at the communication towers.

3694
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:45,460
Yeah.

3695
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:50,300
You should be able to go over the glacier by using the communication tower's walkway.

3696
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,740
Head for the towers.

3697
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:52,420
Okay.

3698
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:53,220
Okay.

3699
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:53,520
Okay.

3700
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:55,180
Um.

3701
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:55,960
Anyway.

3702
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,040
Mine detector.

3703
02:27:58,260 --> 02:27:59,060
Oh my God.

3704
02:27:59,120 --> 02:27:59,540
I forgot.

3705
02:27:59,720 --> 02:27:59,940
Okay.

3706
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:00,140
Yeah.

3707
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:00,320
Yeah.

3708
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:00,460
Yeah.

3709
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,100
Oh my gosh.

3710
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:02,000
There're so many mines!

3711
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:03,800
And then there's also the cameras.

3712
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,840
Let's grab this.

3713
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:11,100
This.

3714
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:13,860
Oh.

3715
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:14,480
Oh, shoot.

3716
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:15,060
Uh oh.

3717
02:28:15,180 --> 02:28:17,060
I can't keep any more of them.

3718
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:19,620
Okay.

3719
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:23,520
So now I have to avoid the camera and also avoid the bombs.

3720
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:24,900
This is very fun.

3721
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:26,260
I like this.

3722
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,160
Maybe I should have just taken the shortcut.

3723
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:28,980
Maybe...

3724
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:30,320
Let's go this way.

3725
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:36,080
What the... Oh, it scared me so bad!

3726
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:40,720
Oh my gosh!

3727
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,540
That spooked me.

3728
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,380
Like crazy.

3729
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:50,040
How did you see me?

3730
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:56,120
Am I okay?

3731
02:28:58,320 --> 02:28:59,000
Oh wait, no.

3732
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,480
I need this.

3733
02:29:00,660 --> 02:29:01,600
I need the...

3734
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,200
Wait, can I see them with the night vision?

3735
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:05,320
I can't see anything with the night vision!

3736
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:11,670
Look how many claymores there are.

3737
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:12,750
It's so crazy.

3738
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:15,570
Walks in front of camera.

3739
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:16,170
How did you see me?

3740
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:17,450
I thought I walked under it!

3741
02:29:17,510 --> 02:29:18,290
What are you talking about?

3742
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:19,710
I'm looking at my little dot.

3743
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:21,190
Okay.

3744
02:29:21,950 --> 02:29:23,130
I'm looking at my little dot.

3745
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:27,230
There we go.

3746
02:29:28,410 --> 02:29:28,930
Let me in!

3747
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:29,230
Let me in!

3748
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:29,530
Let me in!

3749
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:29,830
Let me in!

3750
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:30,110
Let me in!

3751
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:52,660
It's not so bad.

3752
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,160
But from here, I am going to go to the bathroom real quick.

3753
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:57,220
I hope you guys don't mind.

3754
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:00,220
But I'm going to go to the bathroom.

3755
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:07,480
Actually, I think he'll be able to see me.

3756
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:09,000
So we'll crawl like that.

3757
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:09,900
I'll be right back.

3758
02:30:16,090 --> 02:30:17,750
And I'm gonna get some more tea also.

3759
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:18,970
So I'll be right back.

3760
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:20,170
You guys can listen to this.

3761
02:30:20,350 --> 02:30:22,430
And just enjoy the music and the ambience.

3762
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:23,910
BRB.

3763
02:30:23,910 --> 02:30:24,830
Better wash your hands.

3764
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:25,430
I always do.

3765
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:26,590
I always do.

3766
02:30:27,870 --> 02:30:28,310
Okay.

3767
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:28,850
Be right back.

3768
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:08,660
I almost just spilled my tea.

3769
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:10,540
I'm back.

3770
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:10,860
I'm back.

3771
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:11,220
I'm back.

3772
02:34:11,980 --> 02:34:12,420
Welcome

3773
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:15,960
back.

3774
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:16,520
Thank you.

3775
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:18,300
We are no longer fishing.

3776
02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:19,300
Scatter!

3777
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:20,460
No.

3778
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:21,380
Get in here.

3779
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,140
Get in here.

3780
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:23,880
Get in here.

3781
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:24,640
Get in here.

3782
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,600
Welcome back.

3783
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:27,060
Thank you.

3784
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,860
What kind of tea is it?

3785
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:29,780
Just some green tea?

3786
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:31,900
Just some green tea.

3787
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:34,900
Okay.

3788
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:39,480
Okey dokey.

3789
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:40,120
Alright.

3790
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:41,800
This guy just left.

3791
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:43,380
So perfect timing for us.

3792
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:44,180
Let's go.

3793
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,200
And I'm gonna become a box.

3794
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:06,460
Wait.

3795
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:07,460
I think that was the...

3796
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:08,760
Was that the guy upstairs or downstairs?

3797
02:35:09,140 --> 02:35:09,620
I can't tell.

3798
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:10,320
Oh.

3799
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:10,640
Okay.

3800
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:10,920
Okay.

3801
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:11,080
Okay.

3802
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:11,260
Whoo.

3803
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:15,000
Now I know there's chaff grenades over there though.

3804
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:15,840
So I'm gonna grab them.

3805
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:17,040
Huh.

3806
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:18,520
Just a box.

3807
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:20,760
Just a box.

3808
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:21,860
Just a box.

3809
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:22,300
Just a box.

3810
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,320
Why does the category say MGS2?

3811
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:26,000
Oh.

3812
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:26,180
It does?

3813
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:27,880
That's so weird.

3814
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:30,340
What sort of sword did I put in MGS1?

3815
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:32,980
I'll change it.

3816
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:36,820
Thanks for letting me know.

3817
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:38,080
I had no idea.

3818
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:41,620
Chaff grenades.

3819
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,480
Perfect timing.

3820
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:02,540
I'm

3821
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:06,660
gonna wait for him to pass.

3822
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:07,240
I'm scared.

3823
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:12,760
This says 1 for me.

3824
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:13,840
That's so weird.

3825
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:14,400
I don't know.

3826
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:18,060
Oh my god.

3827
02:36:18,100 --> 02:36:18,580
I did it again.

3828
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:19,200
No.

3829
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:19,740
We're going to...

3830
02:36:19,740 --> 02:36:21,140
We're going to basement 1.

3831
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,620
It says MGS part 2.

3832
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:34,540
As in...

3833
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:35,500
As in...

3834
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:36,140
As in...

3835
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:37,100
It is day 2.

3836
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:37,460
Yes.

3837
02:36:37,740 --> 02:36:38,700
That is correct.

3838
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:40,060
It is the day 2.

3839
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:42,480
Or the second time of me streaming.

3840
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:48,200
Metal Gear Solid 2...

3841
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:48,920
1.

3842
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:50,800
Part 2.

3843
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:55,680
Even my brain can't understand.

3844
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:58,460
Even my brain can't handle it.

3845
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,140
Yay!

3846
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:05,100
Wait.

3847
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:07,680
My health is good.

3848
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:09,180
Life is good.

3849
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:11,820
Afterlife is good.

3850
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:13,040
So long.

3851
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:16,160
For me it says old Metal Gear 1987 game.

3852
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:16,480
What?

3853
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:19,460
What is up with MewTube?

3854
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:24,720
I swear, MewTube doesn't know anything, I think.

3855
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:29,040
Don't attack me.

3856
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:30,380
I'm just a box.

3857
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:33,700
I'm just a box that you love.

3858
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:37,380
Oh gosh, I can't see anything in here.

3859
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:42,480
Oh, I don't need those.

3860
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:42,820
Okay.

3861
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:44,380
Thank you.

3862
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:45,200
Love you too.

3863
02:37:52,650 --> 02:37:53,490
Love you too.

3864
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:54,210
Love you too.

3865
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,240
We're good.

3866
02:38:19,410 --> 02:38:21,270
Are the bombs here again?

3867
02:38:21,310 --> 02:38:21,570
Or...

3868
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:24,570
I'm just gonna crawl anyway.

3869
02:38:24,690 --> 02:38:25,370
I can't remember.

3870
02:38:26,430 --> 02:38:27,570
I don't think so.

3871
02:38:29,090 --> 02:38:30,390
I think they're gone gone.

3872
02:38:34,530 --> 02:38:35,490
My immersion?

3873
02:38:35,670 --> 02:38:36,890
I was crawling to that part?

3874
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:40,210
Ew, there's cat hair in my teeth!

3875
02:38:40,770 --> 02:38:41,250
What?!

3876
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:44,470
Sorry, Meryl.

3877
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:46,350
I'm sad about you too.

3878
02:38:46,690 --> 02:38:48,010
I'm more sad about my teeth.

3879
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:54,910
How did I get in there?

3880
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:01,970
The normal cat life.

3881
02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:08,230
I... I can still help.

3882
02:39:09,270 --> 02:39:11,150
I want to help you.

3883
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:13,270
Quiet down.

3884
02:39:13,430 --> 02:39:14,270
Save your strength.

3885
02:39:17,310 --> 02:39:18,250
I was a fool.

3886
02:39:18,910 --> 02:39:20,870
I wanted to be a soldier.

3887
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:22,570
She wanted to be a soldier, you guys.

3888
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:23,370
But war is ugly.

3889
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:26,810
There's nothing glamorous about it.

3890
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:30,050
Snake, please save yourself.

3891
02:39:30,690 --> 02:39:33,390
Go on living and don't give up on people.

3892
02:39:35,890 --> 02:39:37,210
Don't forget me.

3893
02:39:41,970 --> 02:39:43,070
It's PTSD.

3894
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:47,610
Snake, about Meryl.

3895
02:39:48,190 --> 02:39:49,810
Colonel, I'm sorry.

3896
02:39:49,810 --> 02:39:51,230
Listen to me.

3897
02:39:52,250 --> 02:39:53,990
I wasn't able to protect her.

3898
02:39:56,510 --> 02:39:57,910
Snake, she's a soldier.

3899
02:39:58,450 --> 02:40:01,070
She knows that prisoners are a part of war.

3900
02:40:02,130 --> 02:40:04,370
She joined up of her own free will.

3901
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:06,870
I'm sure she was prepared for this.

3902
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:09,670
You're very understanding now, all of a sudden.

3903
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:12,230
Meryl thought she had to become a soldier.

3904
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:14,190
Thought it was the only way.

3905
02:40:15,230 --> 02:40:17,850
She said she thought it would bring her closer to her dead father.

3906
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:18,450
I love this track.

3907
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:20,530
She said that?

3908
02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:23,030
She wasn't ready for real combat.

3909
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:25,490
I shouldn't have pushed her so hard.

3910
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:27,590
It's all my fault.

3911
02:40:28,470 --> 02:40:29,650
It's not like you, Snake.

3912
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:30,590
Master!

3913
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:31,930
What is it?

3914
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:35,510
Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just couldn't listen anymore.

3915
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:36,730
Master.

3916
02:40:37,310 --> 02:40:37,910
Master.

3917
02:40:37,910 --> 02:40:40,310
Snake, you can have regrets if you want to.

3918
02:40:40,370 --> 02:40:41,370
It's only natural.

3919
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:45,630
But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in the past.

3920
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:48,010
That road leads to madness.

3921
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:49,650
Believe me.

3922
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:50,910
He's right.

3923
02:40:51,070 --> 02:40:51,970
Don't kick yourself.

3924
02:40:52,350 --> 02:40:54,130
It doesn't suit a legend like you.

3925
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:56,490
I'm sure Meryl's just fine.

3926
02:40:57,330 --> 02:40:57,990
Mei Ling.

3927
02:40:58,370 --> 02:41:00,370
Snake, forget about Meryl.

3928
02:41:00,390 --> 02:41:01,210
Stop Liquid.

3929
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:03,070
That's what Meryl would want too.

3930
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:04,050
Meryl's still alive.

3931
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:05,190
Don't talk like she's dead.

3932
02:41:05,290 --> 02:41:06,450
Meryl would say the same thing.

3933
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:07,750
I didn't submit, okay?

3934
02:41:07,850 --> 02:41:08,290
Snake.

3935
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:08,730
What?

3936
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:10,870
Meryl.

3937
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,230
She's pretty special to you, huh?

3938
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:15,910
Don't undermine my abilities like that.

3939
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:17,290
There aren't many women like her around.

3940
02:41:17,290 --> 02:41:18,590
That's not what I meant.

3941
02:41:19,570 --> 02:41:20,870
She's the Colonel's niece.

3942
02:41:21,110 --> 02:41:22,230
And a combat buddy.

3943
02:41:22,570 --> 02:41:23,950
A combat buddy?

3944
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:24,790
Come on.

3945
02:41:25,050 --> 02:41:26,990
She's like a police interrogation.

3946
02:41:27,090 --> 02:41:28,410
No, I just...

3947
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:30,250
I guess it's in the genes.

3948
02:41:30,650 --> 02:41:32,050
What do you mean by that?

3949
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:33,810
What are you talking about, Colonel?

3950
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:34,910
No.

3951
02:41:35,230 --> 02:41:37,470
I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.

3952
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:44,150
I think Naomi said he rose as high as Assistant Secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time.

3953
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:45,630
Is that right?

3954
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:46,630
Yes.

3955
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:47,270
Yes.

3956
02:41:47,410 --> 02:41:48,650
He was Japanese.

3957
02:41:49,010 --> 02:41:52,230
And he became a special undercover investigator to nab the mafia.

3958
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:53,630
When was that?

3959
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:56,370
Sometime in the 50s, I guess.

3960
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:57,290
Where?

3961
02:41:57,750 --> 02:41:58,950
In New York, I think.

3962
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:00,010
Naomi.

3963
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:02,890
I thought you didn't have any family.

3964
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:04,330
Master clocking her?

3965
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:09,170
My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.

3966
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:10,850
I never even had the chance to meet him.

3967
02:42:13,230 --> 02:42:13,750
Snake.

3968
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:14,570
Good luck.

3969
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:16,090
Watch your back, Snake.

3970
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:18,930
Suss, suss, suss.

3971
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:19,930
Naomi, so suss.

3972
02:42:20,350 --> 02:42:21,790
Naomi, so suss.

3973
02:42:23,290 --> 02:42:26,470
I don't remember where the cameras are at.

3974
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:29,830
I know it's that middle one down there, I'm pretty sure.

3975
02:42:30,050 --> 02:42:31,130
I don't think there's any in here.

3976
02:42:34,410 --> 02:42:36,170
I can hear it eventually.

3977
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:44,040
That is a trap.

3978
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:45,620
Ah!

3979
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:50,280
Diarrhea is hereditary.

3980
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:52,000
It runs in your genes.

3981
02:42:52,300 --> 02:42:52,500
No!

3982
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,280
No, it doesn't, please.

3983
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:03,360
Someone said to shoot the rats for a special codec.

3984
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:05,500
I've never gotten that one before, but...

3985
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:13,120
I don't know if I want to waste any dice as a Pam.

3986
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:15,400
Have you played Unmetal?

3987
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:16,480
I haven't yet, actually.

3988
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:19,400
I would like to try it someday.

3989
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:22,940
The crows, too?

3990
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:25,760
I think I shot a crow in Twin Snakes.

3991
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:28,880
The rats, though.

3992
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:30,020
Shoot the rats?

3993
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:31,700
Oh, there's more up there.

3994
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,680
I'm trying to get more.

3995
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:35,700
We're going to need this.

3996
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:38,300
We're going to need it.

3997
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:40,240
Oh, this is just PSG.

3998
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:43,700
Okie dokie.

3999
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,820
If I shoot it, if I... I know where the rats were.

4000
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:50,660
I knew where they were.

4001
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:53,000
Do I... How do I get them, though?

4002
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:53,860
With the sniper?

4003
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,340
I guess I'll try it once.

4004
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:58,160
Don't see me.

4005
02:43:58,340 --> 02:43:58,880
Oh, here.

4006
02:43:58,960 --> 02:44:00,080
Actually, I can probably do it from here.

4007
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:01,240
Let's try it.

4008
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:01,740
Let's try it.

4009
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:02,880
I'm curious.

4010
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:05,340
Rat.

4011
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:07,840
Oh, I can't go any higher.

4012
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,360
Uh...

4013
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:15,200
Do I have to go far, far?

4014
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:16,240
Ok, hold on.

4015
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:29,540
I'm not going to use any dyes of him.

4016
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:31,280
I'm just going to do it.

4017
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:37,280
I'm a gamer.

4018
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:40,140
I'm a gamer!

4019
02:44:43,380 --> 02:44:45,160
I shot the rat!

4020
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:49,540
I shot the rat!

4021
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:52,180
Who do I call?

4022
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:57,520
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4023
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:00,460
Nastasha, I shot that rat.

4024
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:09,960
Oh, need three kills.

4025
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:10,280
Ok.

4026
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:12,320
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4027
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:13,740
Oh, this was really long.

4028
02:45:13,860 --> 02:45:14,460
I'm so sorry.

4029
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:15,660
I'm so sorry, Nastasha.

4030
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:17,920
I'm sorry, Nastasha.

4031
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,060
I'm sorry.

4032
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:22,040
There's another little rat.

4033
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:23,120
Oh my goodness.

4034
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:25,060
The shaky cam is crazy.

4035
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:29,340
Let me use the cigarettes instead so that...

4036
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:31,280
It's not so bad.

4037
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:33,120
I don't know if you can hear my controller.

4038
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:34,720
Oh gosh.

4039
02:45:36,740 --> 02:45:37,380
Two!

4040
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:45,840
It's giving me motion sick a little.

4041
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,500
Oh.

4042
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,000
Dang it.

4043
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:54,280
Dang it.

4044
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:57,760
Come here, rats.

4045
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,940
Come here, rats.

4046
02:45:58,940 --> 02:46:00,060
I'll shoot you all down.

4047
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:00,920
Ah!

4048
02:46:01,220 --> 02:46:02,000
You're so fast.

4049
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:04,900
Come here, little rat.

4050
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:05,600
Oh my gosh.

4051
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:07,020
The shaky cam, for real.

4052
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,160
Hello?

4053
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:13,400
Snake, we don't need a rat trap.

4054
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:16,660
We need someone to stop that goddamn nuke from getting launched.

4055
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:19,180
Sorry, Colonel.

4056
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:22,680
You seemed pretty disappointed in me, you guys.

4057
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:28,860
I think he was kind of mad, for real.

4058
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:31,920
I think he seemed really disappointed in me.

4059
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:34,000
I'm not gonna lie.

4060
02:46:34,980 --> 02:46:35,880
He's angry.

4061
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:47,020
In we go!

4062
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:05,260
There's a lot of stuff here.

4063
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:11,260
Why is the music so eerie?

4064
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:37,920
This way.

4065
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,860
I don't

4066
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:04,420
remember what to do here.

4067
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:05,020
Hold on.

4068
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:06,100
I am?

4069
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:06,580
Oh god.

4070
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:24,700
Oh, here we go.

4071
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:25,080
Here we go.

4072
02:48:25,100 --> 02:48:25,360
Here we go.

4073
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:26,940
Oh god.

4074
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:27,660
No!

4075
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:28,640
Leave me alone!

4076
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:29,880
Leave me alone!

4077
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,520
Leave me alone, you freak!

4078
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:32,840
Leave me alone!

4079
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:33,380
You leave me alone!

4080
02:48:41,050 --> 02:48:42,970
Why are you so obsessed with me?

4081
02:48:44,170 --> 02:48:45,190
Leave me alone!

4082
02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:46,850
So...

4083
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:51,470
Oh my gosh.

4084
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:53,470
God,

4085
02:49:12,910 --> 02:49:13,650
am I gonna make it?

4086
02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:14,570
Oh my god.

4087
02:49:14,650 --> 02:49:17,820
I remember this...

4088
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:18,340
Okay, hold on.

4089
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:20,600
I do remember... I remember this part now.

4090
02:49:20,860 --> 02:49:22,200
But I think I'm gonna die.

4091
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:23,700
I might have to redo it anyway.

4092
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:25,080
That's okay, though.

4093
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:27,500
I remember... I think...

4094
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:31,460
I don't have a lot of stun grenades, though.

4095
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:32,680
Ouch.

4096
02:49:38,150 --> 02:49:38,830
There we go.

4097
02:49:40,110 --> 02:49:40,730
Sorry, guys.

4098
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:42,630
You probably were, like, screaming that in the comments.

4099
02:49:42,690 --> 02:49:43,590
And I forgot.

4100
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:44,570
Oh, no!

4101
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:45,750
Throw the grenade, Snake!

4102
02:49:46,070 --> 02:49:46,470
Ouch.

4103
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:46,930
Okay, okay.

4104
02:49:47,050 --> 02:49:47,410
Hold on.

4105
02:49:48,510 --> 02:49:48,910
Why

4106
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:58,830
are there so many of you guys?

4107
02:49:59,710 --> 02:50:00,770
Just keep running, Snake.

4108
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:01,270
Just keep running.

4109
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:02,610
Just keep running, Snake.

4110
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:03,690
And next one.

4111
02:50:04,430 --> 02:50:04,830
Flashbang!

4112
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:07,490
Flashbang!

4113
02:50:12,770 --> 02:50:13,150
Flashbang!

4114
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:18,380
That was a waste.

4115
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:19,140
That's okay.

4116
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:41,820
Zero.

4117
02:50:41,900 --> 02:50:42,960
One HP and a dream, baby.

4118
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:46,160
Leave me alone!

4119
02:50:52,700 --> 02:50:53,080
Ration.

4120
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,220
Climb!

4121
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:54,500
Climb!

4122
02:50:54,580 --> 02:50:54,720
Climb!

4123
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:54,960
Climb!

4124
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:55,160
Climb!

4125
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:56,120
Climb!

4126
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:56,320
Climb!

4127
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:00,740
Climb!

4128
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,380
I just got to the ration, too.

4129
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:06,800
Even...

4130
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:07,160
Okay, okay.

4131
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:09,860
I don't have a lot of flash... or a lot of...

4132
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:10,680
Are they...

4133
02:51:10,680 --> 02:51:11,680
I don't...

4134
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:14,900
The reason I forgot about the stun grenades is because they don't give you any.

4135
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:16,200
I only have three!

4136
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:18,760
They must give you more here, right?

4137
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:22,300
Or they don't.

4138
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,160
That's fine, too.

4139
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:27,760
I think one of those...

4140
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:28,260
So, it's...

4141
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:30,480
I think they give you more stun grenades and then they give you the rope.

4142
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:34,580
You should have to avoid the other one.

4143
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:36,080
I think the alert...

4144
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:37,360
You have to do it, though, right?

4145
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:38,260
Like...

4146
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:43,260
A bunch of guys climbed up the ladder after you with MGS3?

4147
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:44,260
I would cry.

4148
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:45,580
I would cry.

4149
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:51,720
Yeah, the alert is scripted.

4150
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:53,660
Yeah, you have to go through this, unfortunately.

4151
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:57,880
But also, I don't think it would work, the chaff, because, like, it's already...

4152
02:51:57,880 --> 02:51:59,920
Our thing is already jammed, so...

4153
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:01,140
Okay, okay, okay.

4154
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:02,420
Okay, okay, okay.

4155
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:04,060
Okay.

4156
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:04,580
Okay.

4157
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:04,840
Um...

4158
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:09,260
I'm gonna stun as much as I can, and then...

4159
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:11,220
And then...

4160
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:13,240
And then...

4161
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:14,580
Fam...

4162
02:52:14,580 --> 02:52:15,000
Famas.

4163
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:17,280
Start with the famas?

4164
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:17,800
You think so?

4165
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:19,560
Start with it, and then use the stuns later?

4166
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:21,340
Mmm...

4167
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:24,720
Yeah, I wonder what the speedrunning trick...

4168
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:25,280
Probably just...

4169
02:52:25,280 --> 02:52:26,760
Just don't mess it up.

4170
02:52:29,060 --> 02:52:29,460
Yeah!

4171
02:52:38,740 --> 02:52:39,340
Oh, my God.

4172
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:39,500
Oh, my God.

4173
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:39,640
Okay.

4174
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:40,180
Never mind.

4175
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:41,000
This is so bad.

4176
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:00,930
Thank you.

4177
02:53:02,990 --> 02:53:03,310
Flash!

4178
02:53:03,470 --> 02:53:03,790
Bang!

4179
02:53:06,850 --> 02:53:07,170
Flash!

4180
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:24,480
Oh...

4181
02:53:24,480 --> 02:53:25,080
Get up!

4182
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:25,280
Get up!

4183
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:25,440
Get up!

4184
02:53:25,440 --> 02:53:25,560
Snake!

4185
02:53:25,640 --> 02:53:25,860
Get up!

4186
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:26,320
Please!

4187
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:26,920
Please!

4188
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:27,180
Please!

4189
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:27,300
Please!

4190
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:30,320
The thing about the famas is I have to, like, run, you know?

4191
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:31,600
I have to, like...

4192
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:32,460
I have to just keep going.

4193
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,980
So that's why it's easier to do the stun grenade.

4194
02:53:36,100 --> 02:53:36,740
Just flash!

4195
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:38,080
Bang!

4196
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:39,100
Ouch!

4197
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:39,300
Ouch!

4198
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:39,440
Ouch!

4199
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:39,640
Ouch!

4200
02:53:39,800 --> 02:53:39,860
Ouch!

4201
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:40,080
Ouch!

4202
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:40,200
Get up!

4203
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:40,460
Get up!

4204
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:41,760
Yeah.

4205
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:44,260
Run!

4206
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:44,620
Run!

4207
02:53:44,660 --> 02:53:44,820
Run!

4208
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:48,430
Flash!

4209
02:53:50,810 --> 02:53:51,150
Bang!

4210
02:53:57,110 --> 02:53:57,450
Ouch!

4211
02:53:57,490 --> 02:53:57,690
Ouch!

4212
02:53:58,070 --> 02:53:58,410
Flash!

4213
02:53:59,330 --> 02:53:59,670
Oh!

4214
02:53:59,710 --> 02:53:59,990
Ouch!

4215
02:54:00,110 --> 02:54:00,290
No!

4216
02:54:00,350 --> 02:54:00,430
No!

4217
02:54:00,470 --> 02:54:00,550
No!

4218
02:54:00,650 --> 02:54:00,990
Flash!

4219
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:02,890
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!

4220
02:54:05,550 --> 02:54:05,890
Okay.

4221
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:07,710
Now we can go to the famas.

4222
02:54:08,150 --> 02:54:08,490
Up.

4223
02:54:08,750 --> 02:54:09,270
This way.

4224
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:10,190
Okay.

4225
02:54:13,050 --> 02:54:13,830
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4226
02:54:14,210 --> 02:54:14,550
Ah!

4227
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:17,230
Oh, my God.

4228
02:54:17,270 --> 02:54:17,450
Run!

4229
02:54:17,550 --> 02:54:17,630
Run!

4230
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:17,910
Run!

4231
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:18,110
Run!

4232
02:54:18,170 --> 02:54:18,450
Run!

4233
02:54:18,490 --> 02:54:18,910
Run!

4234
02:54:19,010 --> 02:54:19,210
Run!

4235
02:54:19,750 --> 02:54:20,670
Why are you so fast?

4236
02:54:20,890 --> 02:54:21,230
Ah!

4237
02:54:23,150 --> 02:54:23,850
Oh, my God.

4238
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:29,690
They're all gonna come after me!

4239
02:54:30,470 --> 02:54:31,130
Get up!

4240
02:54:31,130 --> 02:54:31,450
Snake!

4241
02:54:34,500 --> 02:54:35,320
Snake, please.

4242
02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:37,820
Snake, run.

4243
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:39,060
Just run, Snake!

4244
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:39,820
Just run!

4245
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:41,220
Just run, Snake!

4246
02:54:42,300 --> 02:54:42,780
Ah!

4247
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:47,320
So much for saving my throat.

4248
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:50,620
Stop shooting at me!

4249
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:51,960
Stop shooting at me!

4250
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:52,520
Stop it!

4251
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,980
Stop it, you freak!

4252
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:54,880
You freak!

4253
02:54:55,280 --> 02:54:55,640
You freak!

4254
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:25,400
I'm gonna drink my hair.

4255
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:25,940
My hair?

4256
02:55:26,040 --> 02:55:26,740
My cat's hair.

4257
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:30,800
I'm gonna drink my tea even though it has a cat's hair in it.

4258
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:33,540
Ah!

4259
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:39,780
Ouch!

4260
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:41,840
Are we okay?

4261
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:44,160
Hmm.

4262
02:55:44,800 --> 02:55:45,140
Hmm-hmm.

4263
02:55:56,690 --> 02:55:57,130
Ugh.

4264
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:04,040
There wasn't so much cat hair.

4265
02:56:04,260 --> 02:56:05,160
There was like two pieces.

4266
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:06,580
I love my cat hair.

4267
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:08,260
Yeah, I'd probably eat my cat's hair all the time.

4268
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:11,620
Call it a minty.

4269
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:12,460
What does that mean?

4270
02:56:16,340 --> 02:56:20,360
What a thrill that was.

4271
02:56:20,580 --> 02:56:21,460
Oh, absolutely!

4272
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:29,740
I'm so cool.

4273
02:56:36,580 --> 02:56:38,580
You're out of shape from all that dog mushing.

4274
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:39,560
Oh, look at you smiling.

4275
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:41,180
Like, you could fucking do that, Colonel.

4276
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:42,800
Wow!

4277
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:48,160
Shut up, Colonel.

4278
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:49,820
You jerk.

4279
02:56:51,440 --> 02:56:52,100
Master Miller!

4280
02:56:53,620 --> 02:56:54,300
Um, Master?

4281
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:55,500
It's fine.

4282
02:56:55,540 --> 02:56:57,100
He's probably, like, going to the bathroom, you know?

4283
02:56:57,460 --> 02:56:58,120
He's fine.

4284
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:01,880
Yeah, Colonel should not be talking.

4285
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:11,740
Mother, ye rosebuds, while ye may.

4286
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:14,040
Old time is still a-flying.

4287
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:19,740
And this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying.

4288
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:22,140
Snake laughter is the best medicine.

4289
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:25,120
You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game.

4290
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:26,740
Enjoy yourself, okay?

4291
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:29,260
Thanks, Mei Ling.

4292
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:31,200
Oh, wait.

4293
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:31,900
I forgot Otacon.

4294
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:36,980
I'm up on the roof.

4295
02:57:37,620 --> 02:57:38,880
That was a pretty fast climb.

4296
02:57:40,060 --> 02:57:40,440
I can go slowly.

4297
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:42,760
But someone there forced me to move faster.

4298
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:43,540
Someone?

4299
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:44,740
Or like ten ones.

4300
02:57:44,800 --> 02:57:45,100
Well, you can relax.

4301
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:47,140
Cause there's an elevator in Tower B.

4302
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:47,720
Yippee!

4303
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:49,140
That walkway will take you to Tower B.

4304
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:51,960
And surely that will be a really easy elevator ride as well.

4305
02:57:53,580 --> 02:57:54,100
Surely.

4306
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:56,620
How

4307
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:03,060
many?

4308
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:04,520
I only have one ration left.

4309
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:13,160
You scared me so much.

4310
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:14,960
Oh my god!

4311
02:58:15,800 --> 02:58:16,320
Snaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy!

4312
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:42,040
Oh, oh no.

4313
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:47,300
Liquid.

4314
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:48,580
Liquid.

4315
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:51,400
You're not going any far.

4316
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:53,900
Die!

4317
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:54,900
No!

4318
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:01,810
Time for another fight.

4319
02:59:01,950 --> 02:59:02,490
No!

4320
02:59:03,530 --> 02:59:05,110
With a hindie.

4321
02:59:09,150 --> 02:59:10,570
Oh well, not yet, actually.

4322
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:11,630
It's a long way down.

4323
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:11,830
Yeah.

4324
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:13,510
If I had a rope...

4325
02:59:13,510 --> 02:59:13,910
You do!

4326
02:59:14,430 --> 02:59:16,670
I should be able to use that rope I got.

4327
02:59:16,830 --> 02:59:17,030
Yes.

4328
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:18,830
What are you going to do?

4329
02:59:18,910 --> 02:59:21,730
Take on a hind with your bare hands?

4330
02:59:22,090 --> 02:59:23,590
Now you're mine!

4331
02:59:24,030 --> 02:59:26,210
If I stay here, I'm finished.

4332
02:59:27,590 --> 02:59:28,470
Use the rope!

4333
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:33,070
Uh, I don't remember actually how I did this part.

4334
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:33,510
You can't actually do that.

4335
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:34,450
Here we go.

4336
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:43,100
Oh my god!

4337
02:59:43,380 --> 02:59:44,320
Oh my god, oh my god.

4338
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:50,350
Punch the chopper.

4339
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:54,930
Oh gosh.

4340
02:59:55,670 --> 02:59:57,070
Colonel, can you help me here?

4341
02:59:57,090 --> 02:59:57,210
Help

4342
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:04,860
me.

4343
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:05,620
What do I do?

4344
03:00:06,660 --> 03:00:07,540
Thank you.

4345
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:09,760
Okay.

4346
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:11,220
Okay.

4347
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:19,360
Pressing right or left on the directional button.

4348
03:00:19,460 --> 03:00:19,940
Big jump.

4349
03:00:19,980 --> 03:00:21,780
You can make a big jump in that direction.

4350
03:00:22,140 --> 03:00:22,280
Big jump.

4351
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:22,420
Okay.

4352
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:29,180
If you press and hold the circle button while using the directional button, you can walk slowly across the wall.

4353
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:35,960
If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from behind while you rappel down.

4354
03:00:36,300 --> 03:00:39,240
If anyone can do it, you can, Snake.

4355
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:41,000
Yeah, you want to make fun of me again?

4356
03:00:41,140 --> 03:00:41,540
Huh?

4357
03:00:42,320 --> 03:00:43,040
About... okay.

4358
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:43,800
Whee!

4359
03:00:45,220 --> 03:00:45,760
Whee!

4360
03:00:46,300 --> 03:00:47,000
Oh my god.

4361
03:00:47,540 --> 03:00:48,360
Oh, I got hit.

4362
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:50,720
Oh my god, I forgot the steam too.

4363
03:00:50,980 --> 03:00:51,200
Ah!

4364
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:52,460
Don't go into the steam, Snake.

4365
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:53,560
Don't go into the steam.

4366
03:00:53,800 --> 03:00:54,340
Oh my god.

4367
03:00:54,420 --> 03:00:54,600
Ouch.

4368
03:00:56,220 --> 03:00:56,580
Here.

4369
03:01:00,890 --> 03:01:01,910
Don't get... don't get...

4370
03:01:02,670 --> 03:01:03,030
Uh...

4371
03:01:03,550 --> 03:01:04,250
Oh, ouch.

4372
03:01:04,290 --> 03:01:04,930
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4373
03:01:05,250 --> 03:01:06,650
I'm trying to avoid stuff.

4374
03:01:06,770 --> 03:01:07,190
Oh my god.

4375
03:01:07,390 --> 03:01:08,290
Avoid the fire.

4376
03:01:08,490 --> 03:01:09,550
And the... and the steam.

4377
03:01:09,910 --> 03:01:10,270
Snake.

4378
03:01:10,450 --> 03:01:10,810
Snake.

4379
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:11,350
Please, Snake.

4380
03:01:11,450 --> 03:01:11,810
Snake.

4381
03:01:14,450 --> 03:01:15,610
Snake, just go down!

4382
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:15,990
Snake!

4383
03:01:16,210 --> 03:01:16,970
Snake, go down!

4384
03:01:17,710 --> 03:01:18,510
Snake, go down!

4385
03:01:18,510 --> 03:01:18,670
Go down.

4386
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:29,520
Hit every steam and fire.

4387
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:30,320
Got it.

4388
03:01:40,980 --> 03:01:42,520
Oh my gosh.

4389
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:44,820
How did I manage that?

4390
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:46,960
I don't need to know.

4391
03:01:50,380 --> 03:01:51,500
Oh, gosh.

4392
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:54,960
Oh, that's right.

4393
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:55,760
The door is frozen.

4394
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:56,200
Wait.

4395
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:57,960
Is this the one that I can blow up with the C2?

4396
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:00,720
No.

4397
03:02:00,740 --> 03:02:00,920
No.

4398
03:02:00,960 --> 03:02:01,680
Don't equip that.

4399
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:05,200
Is this the one that I can blow up... or do I have to wait for that?

4400
03:02:08,540 --> 03:02:08,820
Run.

4401
03:02:08,900 --> 03:02:09,080
Run.

4402
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:09,320
Run.

4403
03:02:11,320 --> 03:02:11,600
Oh.

4404
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:13,000
That's not what I meant to do.

4405
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:13,720
Run.

4406
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:14,100
Run.

4407
03:02:14,180 --> 03:02:14,360
Run.

4408
03:02:14,440 --> 03:02:14,620
Run.

4409
03:02:14,740 --> 03:02:15,120
Hold on.

4410
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:16,900
You guys down there, don't look at me right now.

4411
03:02:19,060 --> 03:02:19,340
Okay.

4412
03:02:21,440 --> 03:02:21,940
There we go.

4413
03:02:25,140 --> 03:02:25,420
Oh.

4414
03:02:25,780 --> 03:02:26,200
Did I...

4415
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:26,820
How do I say C2?

4416
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:28,620
I meant C4.

4417
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:35,160
Oh, gosh.

4418
03:02:35,740 --> 03:02:36,220
Sorry.

4419
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:37,240
I'm a little...

4420
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:39,700
A little...

4421
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:44,580
Shocked after all of that.

4422
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:44,980
You know?

4423
03:02:45,780 --> 03:02:47,280
A lot just happens, everybody.

4424
03:02:47,500 --> 03:02:47,700
Okay?

4425
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:48,600
A lot just happens.

4426
03:02:48,700 --> 03:02:49,320
So, again.

4427
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:52,980
Oh, gosh.

4428
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:55,680
Okay.

4429
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:05,260
I'm going to...

4430
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:05,280
I'm going to...

4431
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:05,340
I'm going to...

4432
03:03:05,740 --> 03:03:07,500
I'm just looking for more rations.

4433
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:08,880
Don't mind me.

4434
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:11,480
C2 is called Geass.

4435
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:12,440
I think you're right.

4436
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:20,940
My brain got a little steamed.

4437
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:27,960
I can't believe... I was... I don't even know what the hell I was doing there.

4438
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:31,560
Sea floor... Floor?

4439
03:03:31,640 --> 03:03:33,060
Wait, sea floor?

4440
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:36,700
Wait, that would also imply that there's a sea ceiling?

4441
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:38,140
A sea wall?

4442
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:42,640
What's wrong with me today?

4443
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:45,520
Thank you!

4444
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:54,540
Although star 2 was delayed around the time MGS was being developed, it would be going to effect 2000.

4445
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:59,160
Star 3 however will be scrapped and replaced with SORT in 2003.

4446
03:04:00,700 --> 03:04:05,390
I know I'm like... Maybe this is pointless.

4447
03:04:06,150 --> 03:04:07,610
But I'm just gonna check anyway.

4448
03:04:08,350 --> 03:04:09,710
I'm a careful person, okay?

4449
03:04:11,650 --> 03:04:12,270
Oh, see?

4450
03:04:14,430 --> 03:04:15,870
There was some stuff I could grab.

4451
03:04:15,970 --> 03:04:17,310
There might be other stuff I can grab.

4452
03:04:17,630 --> 03:04:18,330
Who knows?

4453
03:04:19,530 --> 03:04:20,410
No turrets?

4454
03:04:20,470 --> 03:04:21,670
No turrets yet, you mean.

4455
03:04:22,090 --> 03:04:24,490
Oh wait, actually it's in the other building, isn't there?

4456
03:04:24,570 --> 03:04:25,110
Wait, no.

4457
03:04:25,230 --> 03:04:26,570
The turrets are in this building.

4458
03:04:29,090 --> 03:04:29,970
I don't remember.

4459
03:04:30,170 --> 03:04:31,630
Why am I acting like I know everything?

4460
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,500
Oh, you're so cruel.

4461
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:45,000
Such a cruel mistress.

4462
03:04:45,400 --> 03:04:47,860
If I... Well, I guess I shouldn't go back up there.

4463
03:04:48,020 --> 03:04:49,640
I don't think there was anything else up there, was there?

4464
03:04:53,970 --> 03:04:55,410
Let's go down to the bo... No.

4465
03:04:57,230 --> 03:04:59,030
It's such an annoying...

4466
03:05:03,370 --> 03:05:05,210
The turrets are in the elevator one?

4467
03:05:06,670 --> 03:05:07,470
How many?

4468
03:05:08,050 --> 03:05:08,690
How many?

4469
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:09,650
There's even chaff grenades.

4470
03:05:10,050 --> 03:05:11,190
It's not so bad.

4471
03:05:19,660 --> 03:05:23,740
Make the level 15 mod if you want.

4472
03:05:25,500 --> 03:05:30,300
You gotta be strong first and then you can do this.

4473
03:05:30,300 --> 03:05:30,600
Why das school?

4474
03:05:30,860 --> 03:05:32,900
Does he know how to run?

4475
03:05:33,160 --> 03:05:43,300
He is Johnny T daqui.

4476
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:48,860
Is that the door?

4477
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:52,380
Yeah.

4478
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:01,680
Okay, I'll go.

4479
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:10,020
When's the out of breath codec?

4480
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:10,620
We just had it!

4481
03:06:12,220 --> 03:06:13,340
Let's see what they say actually.

4482
03:06:16,500 --> 03:06:18,240
No, he's scaring me.

4483
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:27,180
I need stinger missiles!

4484
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:28,480
Otacon!

4485
03:06:32,020 --> 03:06:33,300
Yeah.

4486
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:36,660
Oh.

4487
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:42,140
Okay.

4488
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:46,900
What are you talking about?

4489
03:06:47,380 --> 03:06:49,220
There's something I've got to ask you.

4490
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:50,200
Well, what is it?

4491
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:53,480
Well, you see, I...

4492
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:55,820
I'll ask you when I see you.

4493
03:06:55,960 --> 03:06:56,400
Okay!

4494
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:57,380
Bye!

4495
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:03,740
That's a death flag.

4496
03:07:04,220 --> 03:07:04,660
Master!

4497
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:06,400
Master!

4498
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:10,500
He's got stomach issues, you guys.

4499
03:07:10,520 --> 03:07:11,980
He can't pick up the phone right now.

4500
03:07:12,140 --> 03:07:12,460
Okay.

4501
03:07:16,180 --> 03:07:16,620
Hmm...

4502
03:07:24,460 --> 03:07:29,400
I mean, if I just Nikita missile them, you think they can take a missile to the face?

4503
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:31,800
Let's just snipe them.

4504
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:32,860
I think that'll be easier.

4505
03:07:41,140 --> 03:07:42,540
I only have a three.

4506
03:07:42,620 --> 03:07:43,440
It just depends though.

4507
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:47,620
Oh

4508
03:07:56,190 --> 03:07:56,390
my god.

4509
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:56,770
Oh, oh, goodness.

4510
03:07:58,330 --> 03:07:59,090
Oh my god.

4511
03:07:59,950 --> 03:08:00,470
Is

4512
03:08:15,180 --> 03:08:17,140
this the first time I've ever seen the bullets fly?

4513
03:08:19,320 --> 03:08:20,100
Inga me.

4514
03:08:21,500 --> 03:08:22,020
I

4515
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:27,620
forgot my rations.

4516
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:30,180
I forgot to equip my rations.

4517
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:36,260
Anyway...

4518
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:40,260
Anyway...

4519
03:08:40,260 --> 03:08:40,520
Anyway...

4520
03:08:41,260 --> 03:08:42,440
I know why I said C2.

4521
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:45,380
Because it was C2 of the C4s.

4522
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:46,660
You get it?

4523
03:08:47,980 --> 03:08:49,120
Soldier got aimbots.

4524
03:08:49,240 --> 03:08:49,400
Yeah!

4525
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:50,620
How the hell did he hit me?

4526
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:52,700
From so far away.

4527
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:53,700
Crazy.

4528
03:08:55,460 --> 03:08:56,200
Crazy, crazy.

4529
03:08:57,620 --> 03:08:58,060
Okay.

4530
03:08:58,060 --> 03:08:59,520
I'm gonna take out this guy.

4531
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:03,040
Then we're gonna take out the next guy.

4532
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:05,380
They should all be the same height.

4533
03:09:05,560 --> 03:09:06,040
Come out.

4534
03:09:06,460 --> 03:09:07,140
Oh, where?

4535
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:10,720
Oh, yeah.

4536
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:11,240
Come here.

4537
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:11,320
Come here.

4538
03:09:13,740 --> 03:09:14,540
Come on.

4539
03:09:17,060 --> 03:09:17,700
Lucky.

4540
03:09:19,540 --> 03:09:20,440
That's it, right?

4541
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:22,340
Yeah.

4542
03:09:24,520 --> 03:09:25,160
There's...

4543
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:27,520
Okay.

4544
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:29,820
Yippee!

4545
03:09:57,420 --> 03:10:01,000
What if I didn't have the health to survive that shot?

4546
03:10:01,300 --> 03:10:01,920
You know?

4547
03:10:02,920 --> 03:10:03,560
Oh.

4548
03:10:04,540 --> 03:10:05,880
What if I didn't have the health for it?

4549
03:10:07,700 --> 03:10:08,500
Where am I?

4550
03:10:09,060 --> 03:10:10,520
Oh, I'm in the other tower, right?

4551
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:12,180
So now...

4552
03:10:13,880 --> 03:10:15,940
We have to worry about the guy.

4553
03:10:16,100 --> 03:10:16,420
The...

4554
03:10:22,050 --> 03:10:23,650
Now we have to worry...

4555
03:10:23,650 --> 03:10:23,790
Oh!

4556
03:10:24,010 --> 03:10:24,730
There's the elevator.

4557
03:10:26,650 --> 03:10:27,070
Beep.

4558
03:10:28,150 --> 03:10:28,570
Beep.

4559
03:10:30,630 --> 03:10:31,050
Huh?

4560
03:10:35,650 --> 03:10:36,790
Watch him, daisies.

4561
03:10:36,830 --> 03:10:37,250
I'm just...

4562
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:38,270
I might have watched it already.

4563
03:10:39,670 --> 03:10:41,230
I don't maybe not remember the name.

4564
03:10:42,290 --> 03:10:43,150
Oh, sorry.

4565
03:10:44,230 --> 03:10:46,270
I instinctually go to Master Miller.

4566
03:10:49,670 --> 03:10:51,370
Snake, I'm heading your way.

4567
03:10:51,590 --> 03:10:52,770
What are you talking about?

4568
03:10:53,310 --> 03:10:55,110
There's something I've got to ask you.

4569
03:10:55,290 --> 03:10:56,190
Well, what is it?

4570
03:10:57,310 --> 03:10:59,390
Well, you see, I...

4571
03:10:59,970 --> 03:11:01,750
Oh, I'll ask you when I see you.

4572
03:11:01,850 --> 03:11:02,330
Bye.

4573
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:03,910
Wait a minute.

4574
03:11:06,010 --> 03:11:06,490
Interesting.

4575
03:11:06,490 --> 03:11:06,690
Interesting.

4576
03:11:09,090 --> 03:11:12,130
It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you.

4577
03:11:12,330 --> 03:11:14,090
I'm looking at Mei-Ling's digital...

4578
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:14,890
That's not even fair!

4579
03:11:15,250 --> 03:11:18,590
Why does he want to have a showdown in a helicopter?

4580
03:11:19,930 --> 03:11:22,290
I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast.

4581
03:11:22,690 --> 03:11:23,590
Sorry, Snake.

4582
03:11:23,690 --> 03:11:26,170
I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast.

4583
03:11:26,590 --> 03:11:27,990
Snake, I don't like it.

4584
03:11:28,130 --> 03:11:29,710
Please don't go up to the roof.

4585
03:11:29,930 --> 03:11:30,710
I have to.

4586
03:11:30,890 --> 03:11:32,430
I can't run from this one.

4587
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:41,680
I have to.

4588
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:41,680
I can't run from this one.

4589
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:42,860
I'm enjoying it.

4590
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:43,960
Yippee!

4591
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:47,160
All righty.

4592
03:11:55,240 --> 03:11:55,680
But...

4593
03:11:56,820 --> 03:11:58,040
Why am I going down?

4594
03:11:59,400 --> 03:12:00,920
I can't remember this part at all.

4595
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,480
Sorry, like I said, I always forget about the Hind D fight.

4596
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:07,780
Like, so I always forget what to do here.

4597
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:10,300
Colonel, thanks for the super chat.

4598
03:12:12,460 --> 03:12:13,960
It's only going up, I think.

4599
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:16,460
The Hind D...

4600
03:12:17,180 --> 03:12:17,860
part.

4601
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:20,000
Oh!

4602
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:23,540
Damn.

4603
03:12:27,830 --> 03:12:29,960
Time to go back up.

4604
03:12:30,540 --> 03:12:31,480
Damn.

4605
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:38,460
J-Nice.

4606
03:12:38,480 --> 03:12:39,840
Welcome to membership.

4607
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:40,860
Thank you!

4608
03:12:52,940 --> 03:12:53,880
Huh?

4609
03:12:59,270 --> 03:13:00,210
Huh?

4610
03:13:01,330 --> 03:13:02,270
Ah!

4611
03:13:02,470 --> 03:13:02,930
Ah!

4612
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:08,980
Don't shoot!

4613
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:10,100
It's me!

4614
03:13:10,220 --> 03:13:10,680
Don't shoot!

4615
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:12,160
It's me, Snake!

4616
03:13:13,360 --> 03:13:14,340
How'd you get here?

4617
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:17,060
It wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me.

4618
03:13:17,500 --> 03:13:18,680
I'm afraid of heights.

4619
03:13:19,700 --> 03:13:20,640
You were watching?

4620
03:13:21,060 --> 03:13:22,180
Yeah, I was watching.

4621
03:13:23,640 --> 03:13:25,460
I was riding in the back of their truck.

4622
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:26,700
He was watching the whole time.

4623
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:27,880
Thanks to the stealth camouflage.

4624
03:13:28,020 --> 03:13:31,540
The elevator, of course.

4625
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:33,700
Oh, that's why I couldn't take it.

4626
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:35,960
The first floor of the circular staircase was destroyed.

4627
03:13:36,300 --> 03:13:36,500
Yeah.

4628
03:13:37,740 --> 03:13:38,760
The elevator was working?

4629
03:13:39,300 --> 03:13:40,200
Yeah, that's right.

4630
03:13:40,400 --> 03:13:41,360
Yeah, that's right.

4631
03:13:44,240 --> 03:13:44,760
Okay.

4632
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:45,760
You're incredible.

4633
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:49,200
Like a movie hero or something.

4634
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:49,700
I know.

4635
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:50,100
Stop.

4636
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:51,700
No.

4637
03:13:52,440 --> 03:13:53,220
You're wrong.

4638
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:54,740
He's so obsessed with me.

4639
03:13:54,900 --> 03:13:57,000
In movies, the hero always saves the girl.

4640
03:13:57,660 --> 03:13:58,780
You mean Meryl?

4641
03:13:58,980 --> 03:13:59,780
Stop, Snake.

4642
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:00,640
It's not your fault.

4643
03:14:00,880 --> 03:14:01,140
Sorry.

4644
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:03,300
Forget I said anything.

4645
03:14:04,520 --> 03:14:05,040
Snake.

4646
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:07,440
There's something I've really got to ask you.

4647
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:10,000
It's why I followed you up this far.

4648
03:14:10,180 --> 03:14:10,600
Oh, my God.

4649
03:14:16,400 --> 03:14:19,300
Have you ever loved someone?

4650
03:14:19,800 --> 03:14:21,100
That's what you came to ask?

4651
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:21,700
No.

4652
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:24,880
I mean, I was wondering if even soldiers fall in love.

4653
03:14:25,080 --> 03:14:26,160
What are you trying to say?

4654
03:14:26,520 --> 03:14:27,440
I want to ask you.

4655
03:14:29,380 --> 03:14:32,440
Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?

4656
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:33,820
Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?

4657
03:14:33,820 --> 03:14:33,840
Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?

4658
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:34,440
He said it!

4659
03:14:34,660 --> 03:14:34,800
Thank you.

4660
03:14:34,800 --> 03:14:40,460
I think at any time, any place, people can fall in love with each other.

4661
03:14:41,740 --> 03:14:42,220
But...

4662
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:47,260
if you love someone, you have to be able to protect them.

4663
03:14:47,480 --> 03:14:49,000
I think so, too.

4664
03:14:49,820 --> 03:14:51,620
I have a favor to ask.

4665
03:14:51,900 --> 03:14:52,400
Uh-oh.

4666
03:14:52,660 --> 03:14:53,380
Don't worry.

4667
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:54,320
It'll be easy.

4668
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:57,360
I told you before, I don't want to hurt anyone.

4669
03:14:58,300 --> 03:14:59,760
I don't want you to, either.

4670
03:15:00,820 --> 03:15:01,300
Okay.

4671
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:02,980
The elevator has stopped down there.

4672
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:03,340
They're so cute.

4673
03:15:04,800 --> 03:15:05,660
I want you to get it to move.

4674
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:07,820
You see?

4675
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:09,600
That's weird.

4676
03:15:09,940 --> 03:15:12,100
It was working before, but now it isn't.

4677
03:15:12,160 --> 03:15:12,640
That is weird.

4678
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:13,860
Maybe the panel's broken.

4679
03:15:14,440 --> 03:15:15,540
Can you fix it?

4680
03:15:15,780 --> 03:15:16,900
It was working before.

4681
03:15:17,340 --> 03:15:19,340
If it's the mechanism, leave it to me.

4682
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:20,720
We're leaving it to you.

4683
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:22,900
I've got to go and swat a noisy fly.

4684
03:15:23,280 --> 03:15:24,740
Some bothersome flies.

4685
03:15:25,180 --> 03:15:26,580
I'll stay here and hold the fort.

4686
03:15:26,720 --> 03:15:27,580
Gosh, they really are brothers.

4687
03:15:28,020 --> 03:15:29,380
You really look like hell.

4688
03:15:29,580 --> 03:15:30,260
Are you okay?

4689
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:32,480
Don't worry.

4690
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:36,620
If I do this, it doesn't matter.

4691
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:38,840
I just pretend like I'm not here.

4692
03:15:39,140 --> 03:15:40,300
Then I'm not scared.

4693
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:41,060
Little baby.

4694
03:15:41,080 --> 03:15:41,840
Strange logic.

4695
03:15:42,320 --> 03:15:43,680
I'm counting on you.

4696
03:15:47,780 --> 03:15:49,920
Gosh, when he stands still, I really can't see him.

4697
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:54,660
Bye-bye.

4698
03:15:55,820 --> 03:15:56,940
Bye-bye, Otacon.

4699
03:15:57,440 --> 03:15:58,600
Sweet little baby.

4700
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:02,980
Okay.

4701
03:16:03,220 --> 03:16:04,400
Now we can go.

4702
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:07,340
Oh.

4703
03:16:11,700 --> 03:16:12,980
I remembered.

4704
03:16:13,260 --> 03:16:13,900
I remembered.

4705
03:16:14,120 --> 03:16:14,560
I remembered.

4706
03:16:16,440 --> 03:16:17,080
Haha.

4707
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:18,120
Oh.

4708
03:16:20,540 --> 03:16:21,180
Eww.

4709
03:16:21,900 --> 03:16:22,540
Eww.

4710
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:27,340
Stinger time on these?

4711
03:16:28,880 --> 03:16:29,860
Can I use...

4712
03:16:29,860 --> 03:16:30,820
I can't use the Nikita.

4713
03:16:31,180 --> 03:16:33,300
I only have six bullets, though.

4714
03:16:41,660 --> 03:16:41,860
Hmm.

4715
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:45,240
I think I might just chaff it.

4716
03:16:45,360 --> 03:16:49,180
I think maybe each chaff I can go up two staircases, I imagine.

4717
03:16:55,100 --> 03:16:57,320
I have a lot more chaffs than I have Stinger.

4718
03:16:57,500 --> 03:16:59,240
And I'm gonna need the Stinger for the next fight.

4719
03:17:00,340 --> 03:17:00,700
So...

4720
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:08,390
Run, run, run, run!

4721
03:17:08,670 --> 03:17:09,870
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4722
03:17:10,610 --> 03:17:10,970
Oh.

4723
03:17:18,350 --> 03:17:19,330
Oh my god.

4724
03:17:19,830 --> 03:17:21,410
It didn't even have any.

4725
03:17:23,550 --> 03:17:26,950
Otacon Shadow Moose's Heart of Snake Champion 2005.

4726
03:17:27,910 --> 03:17:28,770
Oh, come on!

4727
03:17:34,990 --> 03:17:35,870
Go, go, go.

4728
03:17:37,150 --> 03:17:38,730
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

4729
03:17:38,750 --> 03:17:39,130
Oh.

4730
03:17:39,250 --> 03:17:40,490
I'm just gonna do this again.

4731
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:42,310
That's fine.

4732
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:51,510
This part is so goofy.

4733
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:53,330
There's three of them.

4734
03:17:54,130 --> 03:17:54,150
...

4735
03:17:57,550 --> 03:18:00,050
We'll blow up the cameras as our last resort.

4736
03:18:00,850 --> 03:18:04,690
But I think this is better, since I have a lot of them.

4737
03:18:05,470 --> 03:18:09,190
I have a lot of, uh, chaff grenades and, uh...

4738
03:18:21,340 --> 03:18:25,340
And so, I think it's better to do it like this.

4739
03:18:28,820 --> 03:18:29,300
Chaff!

4740
03:18:31,180 --> 03:18:34,000
Oh, come on, come on snake.

4741
03:18:34,460 --> 03:18:35,520
Not that it matters.

4742
03:18:35,780 --> 03:18:38,180
Not that it matters because there won't be anymore until it's...

4743
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:41,340
They literally... Oh, wait.

4744
03:18:41,620 --> 03:18:44,920
They literally... Why is the angle like this?

4745
03:18:45,140 --> 03:18:46,440
Oh, we're good!

4746
03:18:47,880 --> 03:18:48,360
See?

4747
03:18:49,300 --> 03:18:51,000
Why is it so tight?

4748
03:18:51,400 --> 03:18:52,140
My goodness.

4749
03:18:57,140 --> 03:18:57,880
We did it!

4750
03:18:59,620 --> 03:19:01,140
And we got more chaff grenades.

4751
03:19:01,300 --> 03:19:01,880
Thank you.

4752
03:19:06,750 --> 03:19:07,410
Perfect!

4753
03:19:11,580 --> 03:19:13,040
That's what she said.

4754
03:19:13,220 --> 03:19:14,140
Oh my god.

4755
03:19:14,980 --> 03:19:17,980
She said also that we got more chaff grenades?

4756
03:19:20,680 --> 03:19:21,580
There we go.

4757
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:25,380
What a thrill.

4758
03:19:25,820 --> 03:19:26,880
Wrong game.

4759
03:19:35,080 --> 03:19:36,780
There's nothing over here, right?

4760
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:37,020
Yeah.

4761
03:19:39,860 --> 03:19:41,080
Oh, wrong button.

4762
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:52,000
The security advisor for this building takes a puff of the cigarette and on the third floor there will be three cameras.

4763
03:19:54,040 --> 03:19:55,100
It's true!

4764
03:19:59,840 --> 03:20:05,120
In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote, Solitude sometimes is best society.

4765
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:08,200
And short retirement urges sweet return.

4766
03:20:08,620 --> 03:20:10,160
Is that why you came back, Snake?

4767
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:13,260
You got tired of your short retirement in Alaska, huh?

4768
03:20:13,440 --> 03:20:14,620
I don't know about that.

4769
03:20:14,700 --> 03:20:17,480
I was forcefully... I was kidnapped, Mei Ling.

4770
03:20:17,740 --> 03:20:19,580
I was forcibly brought here.

4771
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:21,780
They didn't give me a choice.

4772
03:20:22,500 --> 03:20:25,300
Liquid is still hovering around the roof of Tower B.

4773
03:20:25,560 --> 03:20:26,820
He's waiting for you.

4774
03:20:27,320 --> 03:20:30,100
Snake, it's time for you to take him on.

4775
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:32,720
Take him on and take him out.

4776
03:20:33,860 --> 03:20:36,780
Master, do you have any wisdom for me before I fight?

4777
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:37,680
No?

4778
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:38,220
Okay.

4779
03:20:39,340 --> 03:20:40,320
Meryl, how about you?

4780
03:20:41,340 --> 03:20:41,780
None?

4781
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:42,320
Okay.

4782
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:45,060
How did Kanye work on that elevator?

4783
03:20:45,480 --> 03:20:46,880
You're gonna go after that hind now?

4784
03:20:47,220 --> 03:20:47,580
Yeah.

4785
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:50,040
I can still hear the sound of its rotors.

4786
03:20:50,300 --> 03:20:52,100
It's just circling the tower.

4787
03:20:52,340 --> 03:20:53,020
Man-napped.

4788
03:20:53,020 --> 03:20:53,960
He must be waiting for you.

4789
03:20:54,180 --> 03:20:56,940
Yeah, well, you won't hear it for much longer.

4790
03:20:57,180 --> 03:20:57,620
Good.

4791
03:20:57,980 --> 03:21:01,000
In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.

4792
03:21:01,560 --> 03:21:02,240
Thank you.

4793
03:21:02,340 --> 03:21:03,800
Let's hear what Nastasha has to say.

4794
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:06,380
She's gonna be like, In the fifties.

4795
03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:10,660
You have stinger missiles.

4796
03:21:11,080 --> 03:21:11,500
Oh, okay.

4797
03:21:11,660 --> 03:21:12,120
Missiles.

4798
03:21:12,320 --> 03:21:13,740
Now you have a chance against the hind.

4799
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:15,580
Only a chance?

4800
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:18,270
Well, you are not exactly evenly armed.

4801
03:21:18,800 --> 03:21:19,280
That's true.

4802
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:20,260
That hind is a monster.

4803
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:24,660
You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance.

4804
03:21:25,140 --> 03:21:25,700
No chance.

4805
03:21:25,720 --> 03:21:27,100
That's a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.

4806
03:21:27,320 --> 03:21:30,880
To shoot down that hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.

4807
03:21:31,240 --> 03:21:31,540
Good.

4808
03:21:31,560 --> 03:21:33,620
Do not try to fight him in that walkway.

4809
03:21:33,880 --> 03:21:36,840
Get upon that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.

4810
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:37,320
Okay.

4811
03:21:39,540 --> 03:21:40,200
All right.

4812
03:21:40,480 --> 03:21:44,880
I don't know how this fight's gonna go, but we shall see.

4813
03:21:48,200 --> 03:21:52,300
We got four rations, but our life is a little not so good.

4814
03:21:52,400 --> 03:21:53,680
If I think in one hit, we'll be...

4815
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:54,560
Oh, wait.

4816
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:56,280
We'll be dead in one hit.

4817
03:21:56,400 --> 03:21:57,360
But, you know.

4818
03:21:58,820 --> 03:22:01,620
So, the snake's finally come out of his hole.

4819
03:22:01,800 --> 03:22:02,420
His hole.

4820
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:04,400
Are you ready now, my brother?

4821
03:22:04,900 --> 03:22:05,740
Why are you calling me brother?

4822
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:07,000
Don't call me brother.

4823
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:07,580
What the hell are you?

4824
03:22:08,060 --> 03:22:08,780
I'm you.

4825
03:22:09,460 --> 03:22:10,400
But better.

4826
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:12,180
What?

4827
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:13,080
What?

4828
03:22:13,280 --> 03:22:15,020
Ask the father that you killed.

4829
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:17,840
I'll send you to hell to feed him.

4830
03:22:23,670 --> 03:22:24,390
All right.

4831
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:26,570
Gosh.

4832
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:29,860
That was a close one.

4833
03:22:34,620 --> 03:22:35,240
Oh, wait.

4834
03:22:35,300 --> 03:22:35,660
How do I...

4835
03:22:35,660 --> 03:22:35,900
Wait.

4836
03:22:35,960 --> 03:22:36,360
Oh, my gosh.

4837
03:22:38,440 --> 03:22:39,320
X button?

4838
03:22:42,260 --> 03:22:42,740
Okay.

4839
03:22:44,680 --> 03:22:46,320
Oh, there are rations over here, though.

4840
03:22:46,540 --> 03:22:47,020
Okay.

4841
03:22:47,020 --> 03:22:47,320
I'll save that.

4842
03:22:47,320 --> 03:22:47,760
I'll save those for later.

4843
03:22:58,740 --> 03:22:59,500
X button?

4844
03:23:09,500 --> 03:23:11,180
You guys, I was thinking like X.

4845
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:11,800
Okay.

4846
03:23:11,840 --> 03:23:12,660
I'm using like a...

4847
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:13,520
What's it called?

4848
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:13,840
Controller.

4849
03:23:14,080 --> 03:23:14,320
AM.

4850
03:23:17,220 --> 03:23:17,700
Oh.

4851
03:23:31,460 --> 03:23:32,300
I can't grab him.

4852
03:23:32,620 --> 03:23:33,220
Come here.

4853
03:23:34,940 --> 03:23:35,520
Come here.

4854
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:36,680
Stop being so sneaky.

4855
03:23:39,380 --> 03:23:40,340
Come here.

4856
03:23:40,920 --> 03:23:42,160
Face me like a man.

4857
03:23:43,160 --> 03:23:43,640
Oh.

4858
03:23:43,720 --> 03:23:43,920
Oh.

4859
03:23:43,980 --> 03:23:44,300
Oh.

4860
03:23:44,300 --> 03:23:44,600
Oh.

4861
03:23:44,680 --> 03:23:45,160
Ouch.

4862
03:23:47,300 --> 03:23:47,520
Ouch.

4863
03:23:47,540 --> 03:23:47,840
Ouch.

4864
03:23:51,690 --> 03:23:52,170
Ouch.

4865
03:23:55,010 --> 03:23:55,330
X.

4866
03:23:56,470 --> 03:23:56,790
X.

4867
03:23:58,910 --> 03:23:59,230
Oh.

4868
03:23:59,290 --> 03:23:59,710
This one.

4869
03:24:04,710 --> 03:24:05,430
Oh, my gosh.

4870
03:24:06,370 --> 03:24:07,410
He hit so hard.

4871
03:24:15,150 --> 03:24:15,470
Oh.

4872
03:24:15,470 --> 03:24:15,750
Oh.

4873
03:24:15,770 --> 03:24:16,730
He went the wrong way.

4874
03:24:17,490 --> 03:24:17,810
Oh.

4875
03:24:17,870 --> 03:24:18,950
I thought he was going to go the other way.

4876
03:24:19,790 --> 03:24:20,110
X.

4877
03:24:33,940 --> 03:24:35,620
I might need to go grab...

4878
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:36,560
Oh.

4879
03:24:36,600 --> 03:24:37,260
How do I get up here?

4880
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:38,000
Wait.

4881
03:24:38,060 --> 03:24:38,080
How do I get up here?

4882
03:24:38,100 --> 03:24:38,640
How many do I have?

4883
03:24:39,360 --> 03:24:39,760
Yeah.

4884
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:40,620
Let's just grab these.

4885
03:24:42,740 --> 03:24:44,080
So we can fill up.

4886
03:24:45,220 --> 03:24:45,620
How

4887
03:24:50,160 --> 03:24:51,020
did I manage that?

4888
03:24:51,100 --> 03:24:51,500
I don't know.

4889
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:52,540
That's crazy.

4890
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:54,100
Oh.

4891
03:24:54,180 --> 03:24:54,500
No.

4892
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:55,420
Let's go over here.

4893
03:24:57,560 --> 03:24:57,960
Ouch.

4894
03:25:03,300 --> 03:25:04,440
Actually, I'm going to go...

4895
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:07,960
Oh, my gosh.

4896
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:10,080
Okay.

4897
03:25:18,650 --> 03:25:19,350
I don't know.

4898
03:25:20,550 --> 03:25:20,950
Okay.

4899
03:25:21,530 --> 03:25:22,670
He's on this side.

4900
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:27,800
Oh.

4901
03:25:27,880 --> 03:25:28,160
Oh.

4902
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:29,940
I got him still.

4903
03:25:30,660 --> 03:25:31,060
Yipee.

4904
03:25:33,160 --> 03:25:33,560
Oh.

4905
03:25:33,660 --> 03:25:33,740
Oh.

4906
03:25:33,760 --> 03:25:33,840
Shoot.

4907
03:25:33,940 --> 03:25:34,140
Shoot.

4908
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:34,360
Shoot.

4909
03:25:34,360 --> 03:25:34,600
Shoot.

4910
03:25:38,300 --> 03:25:39,180
Don't keep shooting.

4911
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:40,280
Stop shooting.

4912
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:42,060
Oh, my gosh.

4913
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:44,200
Unfair.

4914
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:44,860
Oh, my gosh.

4915
03:25:44,920 --> 03:25:45,180
Oh, my gosh.

4916
03:25:45,240 --> 03:25:45,560
Blah...

4917
03:25:45,560 --> 03:25:45,820
Blah...

4918
03:25:48,240 --> 03:25:49,900
You can't just keep shooting at me.

4919
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:53,280
Uh.

4920
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:53,960
Hello?

4921
03:25:54,380 --> 03:25:54,780
Aim.

4922
03:25:55,180 --> 03:25:55,580
Hello?

4923
03:25:55,920 --> 03:25:56,320
Hello?

4924
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:57,120
Stinger missile?

4925
03:25:57,120 --> 03:25:57,240
Stinger Missile?

4926
03:25:57,320 --> 03:25:57,720
Hello?

4927
03:25:57,820 --> 03:25:58,340
Stinger Missile?

4928
03:25:58,680 --> 03:25:59,920
Oh, okay, that's why.

4929
03:26:13,300 --> 03:26:14,800
He's gonna blow this thing up eventually.

4930
03:26:21,530 --> 03:26:22,330
Stop, stop, stop.

4931
03:26:23,530 --> 03:26:24,390
Stop, stop, stop.

4932
03:26:26,970 --> 03:26:27,370
What?

4933
03:26:27,370 --> 03:26:31,110
It did such a little damage even though it was like so in his face.

4934
03:26:32,910 --> 03:26:33,650
What just happened?

4935
03:26:38,490 --> 03:26:39,770
Oh, he's doing that below.

4936
03:26:39,810 --> 03:26:40,750
Are we in phase two?

4937
03:26:41,630 --> 03:26:42,110
Hahaha.

4938
03:26:48,050 --> 03:26:48,530
Ouchie!

4939
03:26:49,730 --> 03:26:50,210
Ouchie!

4940
03:26:56,990 --> 03:26:58,670
I can't... see!

4941
03:27:03,570 --> 03:27:04,050
Ow!

4942
03:27:04,250 --> 03:27:05,590
Oh my gosh, no way.

4943
03:27:06,410 --> 03:27:07,910
Yeah, this one's gonna...

4944
03:27:08,430 --> 03:27:11,170
This one's gonna... this one's gonna take a while, you guys.

4945
03:27:11,350 --> 03:27:12,530
Unfortunately, I think.

4946
03:27:12,670 --> 03:27:14,990
Or rather, a couple tries, I'd say.

4947
03:27:15,350 --> 03:27:16,630
I have no more rations.

4948
03:27:16,950 --> 03:27:18,350
I don't think there's any over here, are there?

4949
03:27:24,370 --> 03:27:24,770
Oi!

4950
03:27:25,750 --> 03:27:26,150
Ah!

4951
03:27:42,270 --> 03:27:43,170
That's so unfair!

4952
03:27:43,410 --> 03:27:44,430
How am I supposed to dodge that?

4953
03:27:48,620 --> 03:27:48,920
Oh my god.

4954
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:51,500
She's gonna hit the walls again.

4955
03:27:51,760 --> 03:27:52,860
This part is so annoying.

4956
03:27:58,020 --> 03:27:58,540
Parry it.

4957
03:28:01,980 --> 03:28:02,980
Yeah, you're right.

4958
03:28:03,440 --> 03:28:04,120
What am I...

4959
03:28:08,660 --> 03:28:10,700
I have to like guess where he's gonna be at.

4960
03:28:12,440 --> 03:28:12,840
Hmm?

4961
03:28:18,940 --> 03:28:20,280
He used the sword.

4962
03:28:23,500 --> 03:28:28,620
So he'll probably, like, come up around... around over here, right?

4963
03:28:37,550 --> 03:28:38,290
He's gone.

4964
03:28:40,970 --> 03:28:41,450
Ah!

4965
03:28:41,590 --> 03:28:41,950
Oh!

4966
03:28:41,950 --> 03:28:43,750
Oh gosh.

4967
03:28:45,090 --> 03:28:48,970
Yeah, I don't think this is... I don't think this is the... this is not the run, but that's okay!

4968
03:28:50,190 --> 03:28:50,670
Ah!

4969
03:28:58,280 --> 03:29:00,600
Can the box counter the Heinz missiles?

4970
03:29:03,020 --> 03:29:03,640
My box?

4971
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:06,400
Like, my cardboard box?

4972
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:07,220
Ah!

4973
03:29:22,880 --> 03:29:23,600
It's okay.

4974
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:27,740
Like I said, I knew this one would be...

4975
03:29:32,420 --> 03:29:34,100
Still annoying, though.

4976
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:35,420
Oh, whoops.

4977
03:29:36,020 --> 03:29:36,800
There we go.

4978
03:29:37,520 --> 03:29:39,020
Still annoying, though!

4979
03:29:40,060 --> 03:29:42,900
So, the snakes finally come out of this hole!

4980
03:29:59,950 --> 03:30:01,010
How did I dodge that?

4981
03:30:22,290 --> 03:30:24,250
Are you frustrated, brother?

4982
03:30:25,290 --> 03:30:26,710
Are you frustrated, brother?

4983
03:30:27,790 --> 03:30:28,770
Which way is he going?

4984
03:30:29,290 --> 03:30:29,910
This way?

4985
03:30:37,620 --> 03:30:38,140
Thought

4986
03:30:51,420 --> 03:30:52,760
he was gonna go the other way.

4987
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:31,960
Okay.

4988
03:31:32,860 --> 03:31:33,740
Goodness gracious.

4989
03:31:33,740 --> 03:31:34,240
Whoa!

4990
03:31:34,740 --> 03:31:35,180
Whoa!

4991
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:39,140
How fast do I need to be...

4992
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:42,500
with the second phase?

4993
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:43,200
This part.

4994
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:44,500
Oh gosh, here it comes.

4995
03:31:46,280 --> 03:31:46,720
Yeah!

4996
03:31:47,240 --> 03:31:50,280
How fast do I need to be when he comes up is my thing.

4997
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:51,280
You know?

4998
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:53,440
No body armor?

4999
03:31:53,600 --> 03:31:54,240
I don't have any.

5000
03:31:54,620 --> 03:31:56,640
I don't have any bo... I never picked it up.

5001
03:32:00,220 --> 03:32:01,960
I don't even remember where it's at.

5002
03:32:02,680 --> 03:32:03,180
It's okay.

5003
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:03,260
It's okay.

5004
03:32:22,270 --> 03:32:23,310
Oh, wait, he's here.

5005
03:32:24,410 --> 03:32:25,390
Oh, this is that way.

5006
03:32:26,990 --> 03:32:27,310
Ah!

5007
03:32:28,490 --> 03:32:28,810
Oh

5008
03:32:38,050 --> 03:32:38,270
my gosh.

5009
03:32:38,350 --> 03:32:39,450
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5010
03:32:47,950 --> 03:32:51,250
So, shoot once he comes up, but after he shoots.

5011
03:32:58,330 --> 03:32:58,990
Oh, come on.

5012
03:32:59,070 --> 03:32:59,550
That's so unfair.

5013
03:33:03,710 --> 03:33:04,330
Yeah, boo-boo!

5014
03:33:10,930 --> 03:33:11,250
Okay.

5015
03:33:11,650 --> 03:33:13,010
So, like, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5016
03:33:13,010 --> 03:33:14,930
Oh, I wasn't fast enough.

5017
03:33:15,030 --> 03:33:15,090
Oh, I wasn't fast enough.

5018
03:33:15,090 --> 03:33:15,470
Oh, my God.

5019
03:33:15,570 --> 03:33:15,810
Oh, my God.

5020
03:33:17,650 --> 03:33:18,790
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, sir.

5021
03:33:18,970 --> 03:33:19,570
Sir, sir, sir.

5022
03:33:19,790 --> 03:33:20,430
Please, please.

5023
03:33:22,350 --> 03:33:23,250
Oh, there we go.

5024
03:33:25,670 --> 03:33:27,030
Oh, I'm not fast enough.

5025
03:33:27,670 --> 03:33:28,390
I don't think.

5026
03:33:30,130 --> 03:33:30,850
Wait, how many?

5027
03:33:31,110 --> 03:33:31,790
I have 10.

5028
03:33:32,350 --> 03:33:34,090
Let's grab this while we're here.

5029
03:33:34,910 --> 03:33:35,670
This is so unfair.

5030
03:33:37,470 --> 03:33:37,790
No!

5031
03:33:39,430 --> 03:33:39,930
Oh, my God.

5032
03:33:39,990 --> 03:33:40,970
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

5033
03:33:41,190 --> 03:33:41,510
Snake.

5034
03:33:41,850 --> 03:33:41,870
Snake.

5035
03:33:42,670 --> 03:33:42,990
Snake.

5036
03:33:42,990 --> 03:33:44,570
You scared me sometimes, Snake.

5037
03:33:44,750 --> 03:33:46,310
You scare me sometimes, man.

5038
03:33:46,450 --> 03:33:47,310
You scare me alot.

5039
03:33:48,190 --> 03:33:48,810
Oh, my God.

5040
03:33:53,650 --> 03:33:54,730
Okay, okay, okay.

5041
03:33:56,430 --> 03:34:00,070
And he's back below.

5042
03:34:17,030 --> 03:34:17,470
He's...

5043
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:18,830
I hate when he's over there.

5044
03:34:18,930 --> 03:34:20,130
It's really hard to shoot him from there.

5045
03:34:26,980 --> 03:34:29,400
Nice and nice of...

5046
03:34:36,830 --> 03:34:37,990
Ha ha ha ha!

5047
03:34:39,170 --> 03:34:40,710
Slow and steady I suppose.

5048
03:34:40,710 --> 03:34:40,790
A little pause.

5049
03:34:44,690 --> 03:34:46,550
What was that?

5050
03:34:50,050 --> 03:34:50,650
Like

5051
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:03,100
I shot him, but I didn't.

5052
03:35:03,480 --> 03:35:04,860
He's just yelling.

5053
03:35:05,880 --> 03:35:07,460
He's just yelling into the void.

5054
03:35:09,400 --> 03:35:10,880
Liquid, you're so silly.

5055
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:12,840
Silly guy.

5056
03:35:24,820 --> 03:35:26,680
He's gonna come up any second now.

5057
03:35:30,260 --> 03:35:30,820
No?

5058
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:31,300
Okay.

5059
03:35:31,440 --> 03:35:32,060
Just kidding.

5060
03:35:48,120 --> 03:35:49,120
Wait, where did he go?

5061
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:50,300
Oh, shoot.

5062
03:35:50,580 --> 03:35:51,300
Wait, where did he go?

5063
03:35:51,420 --> 03:35:51,980
Nice.

5064
03:35:56,400 --> 03:35:58,080
Using that radar.

5065
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:03,480
Oh my gosh, that was fast.

5066
03:36:06,080 --> 03:36:08,540
That's me fighting you, bozo.

5067
03:36:27,090 --> 03:36:28,350
That was my bad.

5068
03:36:28,750 --> 03:36:31,670
I instinctually pressed it.

5069
03:36:31,730 --> 03:36:32,770
I knew I shouldn't have though.

5070
03:36:33,490 --> 03:36:34,350
Oh my goodness.

5071
03:36:35,950 --> 03:36:37,330
Come on, come on out.

5072
03:36:37,410 --> 03:36:39,110
I wonder what the speedrun strat for this is.

5073
03:36:39,190 --> 03:36:41,870
Because there's no way that you're just supposed to stand here and wait for him, right?

5074
03:36:45,190 --> 03:36:46,210
That feels crazy.

5075
03:36:57,790 --> 03:36:58,810
Did they skip it?

5076
03:36:59,990 --> 03:37:01,330
Strat has to punch the chopper.

5077
03:37:01,970 --> 03:37:02,370
Obviously.

5078
03:37:08,710 --> 03:37:10,630
You can shoot him from the edge of the rails.

5079
03:37:10,690 --> 03:37:10,950
You can?

5080
03:37:12,770 --> 03:37:16,450
I'm too afraid of it blowing up in my face though, so I will not do that.

5081
03:37:17,970 --> 03:37:21,670
I'm too afraid of it literally exploding on top of me.

5082
03:37:23,030 --> 03:37:25,150
Knowing me, I'll miss somehow, you know?

5083
03:37:26,110 --> 03:37:27,330
That's just how it is.

5084
03:37:29,390 --> 03:37:30,050
Minto gaming.

5085
03:37:38,700 --> 03:37:40,480
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5086
03:37:41,860 --> 03:37:43,400
I did not mean to get hit there.

5087
03:37:45,400 --> 03:37:46,540
Can I hit you now?

5088
03:37:46,680 --> 03:37:47,500
Can I get you now?

5089
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:50,200
Dang it.

5090
03:37:51,020 --> 03:37:51,500
Dang it.

5091
03:37:51,580 --> 03:37:52,620
I missed my chance.

5092
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:54,220
I missed my chance.

5093
03:37:54,540 --> 03:37:55,500
Well, that's frustrating.

5094
03:37:58,140 --> 03:37:58,480
Run,

5095
03:38:13,100 --> 03:38:13,600
run, run, run.

5096
03:38:13,660 --> 03:38:14,340
Don't miss your chance.

5097
03:38:15,140 --> 03:38:15,980
Mr. FonTown.

5098
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:17,720
Oh, why did I...

5099
03:38:17,720 --> 03:38:19,240
I, I, I, I...

5100
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:20,800
How many missiles?

5101
03:38:20,980 --> 03:38:21,940
Okay, I only have six.

5102
03:38:22,220 --> 03:38:24,060
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

5103
03:38:29,440 --> 03:38:30,460
I'm starting to throw.

5104
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:31,400
I'm starting to throw.

5105
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:34,780
I'm starting to throw, you guys.

5106
03:38:43,500 --> 03:38:44,260
Oh my gosh.

5107
03:38:52,820 --> 03:38:54,460
Do I have enough to beat him?

5108
03:38:55,340 --> 03:38:56,960
More missiles will spawn, right?

5109
03:38:56,960 --> 03:38:58,580
Oh, if I can't beat him with the...

5110
03:38:58,580 --> 03:39:00,760
these, I'll have to use like Nikita or something.

5111
03:39:02,100 --> 03:39:03,040
Wouldn't that be something?

5112
03:39:17,930 --> 03:39:18,810
Let's get more quick.

5113
03:39:20,370 --> 03:39:21,690
I only have five left.

5114
03:39:21,810 --> 03:39:22,530
Then I'll have six.

5115
03:39:27,630 --> 03:39:28,890
You'll get more once you run out?

5116
03:39:29,070 --> 03:39:29,110
Okay.

5117
03:40:11,510 --> 03:40:13,070
He went back under too fast.

5118
03:40:13,110 --> 03:40:13,670
I was too slow.

5119
03:40:14,590 --> 03:40:15,230
Skill issue.

5120
03:40:15,410 --> 03:40:16,010
Something, something.

5121
03:40:19,630 --> 03:40:19,990
Ew,

5122
03:40:27,680 --> 03:40:28,580
for being such a coward.

5123
03:40:28,660 --> 03:40:29,560
You're the one in the helicopter.

5124
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:31,040
Why do you keep having to go under?

5125
03:40:31,880 --> 03:40:32,240
Huh?

5126
03:40:32,480 --> 03:40:33,740
Why do you keep hiding yourself?

5127
03:40:35,540 --> 03:40:36,140
Where are you?

5128
03:40:36,280 --> 03:40:37,340
Oh, there you are!

5129
03:40:40,480 --> 03:40:41,500
Wait a second.

5130
03:40:41,740 --> 03:40:42,740
Wait, do I need one more?

5131
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:47,020
Oh, his, his, his propellers are really slow.

5132
03:40:51,420 --> 03:40:51,780
Yippee!

5133
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:15,640
It's exploding, Liquid!

5134
03:41:18,500 --> 03:41:19,640
It's on fire!

5135
03:41:26,320 --> 03:41:27,580
Wow, he's so cool.

5136
03:41:27,680 --> 03:41:28,800
He's just like an action hero.

5137
03:41:29,580 --> 03:41:31,040
Otacon's watching from the door.

5138
03:41:33,840 --> 03:41:35,200
He's like peeking from the door.

5139
03:41:35,220 --> 03:41:35,740
He's like, wow.

5140
03:41:36,920 --> 03:41:38,800
That takes care of the cremation.

5141
03:41:42,360 --> 03:41:43,320
What a loser.

5142
03:41:44,340 --> 03:41:46,160
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

5143
03:41:46,280 --> 03:41:46,720
Thank you.

5144
03:41:47,140 --> 03:41:47,620
Yay!

5145
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:49,400
The behind the...

5146
03:41:53,220 --> 03:41:54,980
Snake, the elevator's working.

5147
03:41:55,140 --> 03:41:55,540
Yay!

5148
03:41:55,540 --> 03:41:55,960
Fixed it?

5149
03:41:56,420 --> 03:41:58,040
No, that's the weird thing.

5150
03:41:58,180 --> 03:41:58,440
Oh.

5151
03:41:58,440 --> 03:41:59,660
It just moved by itself.

5152
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:00,260
Okay.

5153
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:01,520
It's headed your way now.

5154
03:42:01,800 --> 03:42:02,640
Is that so?

5155
03:42:03,060 --> 03:42:03,540
Okay.

5156
03:42:04,040 --> 03:42:06,100
That explosion before, what was it?

5157
03:42:06,740 --> 03:42:09,000
Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.

5158
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:10,900
Helicopter?

5159
03:42:11,440 --> 03:42:12,780
That's incredible, Snake.

5160
03:42:13,060 --> 03:42:13,300
No, it's not.

5161
03:42:13,300 --> 03:42:14,060
That's nothing.

5162
03:42:14,180 --> 03:42:15,220
I just want to make sure again.

5163
03:42:15,420 --> 03:42:18,080
This is the way to get to where Metal Gear is being stored?

5164
03:42:18,360 --> 03:42:18,800
Yeah.

5165
03:42:19,280 --> 03:42:23,580
The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snow field ahead.

5166
03:42:23,880 --> 03:42:24,280
Okay.

5167
03:42:24,720 --> 03:42:26,740
Find a safe place to hide out for a while.

5168
03:42:26,980 --> 03:42:28,040
I'm going under power.

5169
03:42:28,040 --> 03:42:30,840
I just want to say your arigatou, arigatou too is the absolute cutest thing ever.

5170
03:42:31,900 --> 03:42:34,700
Might be the best alert stream of all time.

5171
03:42:35,300 --> 03:42:36,160
You think so?

5172
03:42:36,300 --> 03:42:37,200
Tell me if you need to.

5173
03:42:37,540 --> 03:42:37,980
Thanks.

5174
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:41,260
I mean, arigatou, arigatou too.

5175
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:47,900
I should make some new ones.

5176
03:42:48,100 --> 03:42:49,020
Those are old ones.

5177
03:42:49,720 --> 03:42:51,180
I should make some new ones, right?

5178
03:42:53,080 --> 03:42:53,560
Okay.

5179
03:42:54,300 --> 03:42:54,780
Nice.

5180
03:42:55,960 --> 03:42:57,060
We did it.

5181
03:42:57,060 --> 03:42:58,200
It only took two tries.

5182
03:43:01,300 --> 03:43:04,780
It only took two tries, and we have three rations left.

5183
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:07,380
And Otacon said I'm incredible.

5184
03:43:07,920 --> 03:43:08,400
So.

5185
03:43:08,400 --> 03:43:16,100
So, I believe in, you know, Psycho Mantis.

5186
03:43:16,100 --> 03:43:17,920
He said that I was a gamer.

5187
03:43:18,540 --> 03:43:21,640
So, he said I was a gamer.

5188
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:24,440
I do wonder what I'll get this time.

5189
03:43:24,520 --> 03:43:29,020
Probably, I think before I got Elephant, I'll probably get Elephant again.

5190
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:30,580
If I had to guess.

5191
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:33,400
If I had to guess, I'll probably get it again.

5192
03:43:34,100 --> 03:43:35,320
Wait, where do I go?

5193
03:43:35,540 --> 03:43:36,260
I just go downstairs?

5194
03:43:37,080 --> 03:43:38,240
Why is it in Japanese?

5195
03:43:38,420 --> 03:43:39,580
Because I'm playing Integral.

5196
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:42,980
So, yeah.

5197
03:43:47,910 --> 03:43:50,190
It's all worth it to hear Otacon compliment you.

5198
03:43:50,310 --> 03:43:51,150
I know that's what I'm saying.

5199
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:56,860
Do I have to use my chaffs again?

5200
03:44:01,060 --> 03:44:03,080
I guess we'll get our answer in a second.

5201
03:44:06,220 --> 03:44:07,340
Oh, yes I do.

5202
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:19,320
Or I could use my Stinger Missiles because...

5203
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:23,060
But it only shoots... look at both.

5204
03:44:29,060 --> 03:44:29,820
Yay!

5205
03:44:30,500 --> 03:44:33,620
I only have one ammo left.

5206
03:44:35,560 --> 03:44:37,220
It'll show me the camera.

5207
03:44:38,180 --> 03:44:39,200
Splash damage.

5208
03:44:47,220 --> 03:44:47,740
Nikita.

5209
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:50,100
I think from here, Nikita would be okay.

5210
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:52,040
In fact...

5211
03:44:53,080 --> 03:44:58,400
I mean, I know I'll get Stinger Missile ammo later on again, but...

5212
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:00,300
Oh, I can't use the Nikita.

5213
03:45:01,540 --> 03:45:03,940
Oh, I think because the radar doesn't work, right?

5214
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:06,060
It's all blocked, so...

5215
03:45:06,060 --> 03:45:07,800
I'll just chaff.

5216
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:08,680
I got more.

5217
03:45:09,820 --> 03:45:10,180
Wait!

5218
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:16,120
Oh,

5219
03:45:24,950 --> 03:45:25,570
dang it.

5220
03:45:25,590 --> 03:45:26,010
So close.

5221
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:27,610
Wait!

5222
03:45:54,110 --> 03:45:56,250
I think that's the last one because it's only one, right?

5223
03:45:57,810 --> 03:45:59,430
Yes, that's the last one.

5224
03:45:59,710 --> 03:46:01,390
I guess we could have shot that one, actually.

5225
03:46:02,870 --> 03:46:03,110
Oh!

5226
03:46:05,370 --> 03:46:06,130
Aww, Arakan!

5227
03:46:06,350 --> 03:46:07,950
You left me a bunch of presents!

5228
03:46:08,190 --> 03:46:10,550
How did you know that bullets were my favorite food?

5229
03:46:12,410 --> 03:46:13,230
Um, okay.

5230
03:46:14,670 --> 03:46:15,630
Let's... call?

5231
03:46:19,350 --> 03:46:23,150
I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again.

5232
03:46:23,370 --> 03:46:28,370
If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the snowfield.

5233
03:46:28,630 --> 03:46:28,930
Yes.

5234
03:46:29,270 --> 03:46:33,130
The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the snowfield.

5235
03:46:33,390 --> 03:46:36,570
Oh, she sounds a little... Why do you sound a little nervous about that?

5236
03:46:38,970 --> 03:46:39,970
You did it, Snake!

5237
03:46:40,250 --> 03:46:41,470
You shot down the hind!

5238
03:46:41,470 --> 03:46:42,850
I'm so worried!

5239
03:46:42,950 --> 03:46:47,150
One stinger missile is worth, like, 200k USD and you just have to destroy Walmart now.

5240
03:46:47,510 --> 03:46:50,150
But even so, just because we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up.

5241
03:46:50,330 --> 03:46:52,490
They're still going to try to launch that nuke.

5242
03:46:52,870 --> 03:46:53,690
You're right.

5243
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:55,010
There's no time to waste.

5244
03:46:55,690 --> 03:46:56,210
Hurry!

5245
03:46:56,410 --> 03:46:59,350
The underground base is past the communications tower.

5246
03:46:59,630 --> 03:47:01,470
The elevator's working again, isn't it?

5247
03:47:01,590 --> 03:47:01,990
Yeah?

5248
03:47:02,650 --> 03:47:03,070
Oh...

5249
03:47:03,070 --> 03:47:04,030
Yeah?

5250
03:47:04,890 --> 03:47:05,410
Master?

5251
03:47:07,110 --> 03:47:08,030
No response.

5252
03:47:08,030 --> 03:47:08,330
No response.

5253
03:47:09,850 --> 03:47:10,890
Nastasha?

5254
03:47:16,630 --> 03:47:17,790
I know!

5255
03:47:23,250 --> 03:47:24,290
Easy.

5256
03:47:29,650 --> 03:47:31,550
I'm not just one man.

5257
03:47:32,910 --> 03:47:35,790
I'm... a superman.

5258
03:47:35,990 --> 03:47:37,430
Not copyright.

5259
03:47:39,110 --> 03:47:40,270
Yeah, I'm so great.

5260
03:47:40,570 --> 03:47:41,970
I'm, like, kind of awesome.

5261
03:47:42,550 --> 03:47:42,930
Oh.

5262
03:47:43,630 --> 03:47:44,010
Okay.

5263
03:47:44,630 --> 03:47:45,590
Let's go in here.

5264
03:47:47,490 --> 03:47:49,210
I'm going to equip my gun just in case.

5265
03:47:49,410 --> 03:47:50,810
I don't think anything's going to happen.

5266
03:47:50,930 --> 03:47:52,030
I'm just, you know...

5267
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:00,980
I just, you know...

5268
03:48:09,650 --> 03:48:10,030
Huh?

5269
03:48:10,370 --> 03:48:10,430
Huh?

5270
03:48:10,430 --> 03:48:10,530
Huh?

5271
03:48:11,210 --> 03:48:11,610
Huh?

5272
03:48:13,270 --> 03:48:15,350
Body armor is in the blast furnace.

5273
03:48:17,250 --> 03:48:18,010
Wait, it's where?

5274
03:48:18,350 --> 03:48:19,730
Because I do want it, eventually.

5275
03:48:19,970 --> 03:48:23,050
It's in the blast furnace or back of the gas-filled rooms.

5276
03:48:23,270 --> 03:48:23,710
Oh!

5277
03:48:23,970 --> 03:48:24,630
Okay, okay, okay.

5278
03:48:26,010 --> 03:48:26,450
Cool.

5279
03:48:26,730 --> 03:48:27,670
I will go back there.

5280
03:48:28,710 --> 03:48:29,150
Huh?

5281
03:48:29,950 --> 03:48:31,250
Otacon, you said it was working.

5282
03:48:34,050 --> 03:48:36,410
I don't know why, but the elevator...

5283
03:48:36,410 --> 03:48:36,910
No, it's not!

5284
03:48:37,070 --> 03:48:37,770
It's not working!

5285
03:48:42,570 --> 03:48:42,970
Oh!

5286
03:48:43,090 --> 03:48:43,650
It's working!

5287
03:48:45,090 --> 03:48:45,770
Just kidding.

5288
03:48:46,230 --> 03:48:46,910
I lied.

5289
03:48:47,490 --> 03:48:48,290
I'm a liar.

5290
03:48:48,930 --> 03:48:49,330
Yes?

5291
03:48:50,910 --> 03:48:53,150
Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.

5292
03:48:53,390 --> 03:48:53,670
What's that?

5293
03:48:53,890 --> 03:48:54,030
What?

5294
03:48:54,510 --> 03:48:57,690
There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.

5295
03:48:57,690 --> 03:48:58,830
And one of them should have been mine.

5296
03:48:59,070 --> 03:48:59,210
Yeah?

5297
03:48:59,210 --> 03:49:02,170
So, if you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.

5298
03:49:02,410 --> 03:49:02,790
Yeah?

5299
03:49:03,070 --> 03:49:04,650
Hey, this isn't first grade math class.

5300
03:49:04,910 --> 03:49:05,170
Uh-huh.

5301
03:49:05,210 --> 03:49:06,370
I thought I'd get one for you.

5302
03:49:06,610 --> 03:49:07,750
So, I went back to the lab.

5303
03:49:07,750 --> 03:49:08,510
And...

5304
03:49:08,510 --> 03:49:09,270
Spit it out already!

5305
03:49:10,310 --> 03:49:11,770
The four suits were missing.

5306
03:49:12,030 --> 03:49:12,610
Uh-huh.

5307
03:49:13,050 --> 03:49:15,690
Also, about the elevator that I checked out.

5308
03:49:15,790 --> 03:49:16,230
Uh-huh.

5309
03:49:16,270 --> 03:49:17,130
It's really strange.

5310
03:49:17,490 --> 03:49:20,450
It was like someone was intentionally holding it.

5311
03:49:20,690 --> 03:49:23,570
When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?

5312
03:49:23,890 --> 03:49:25,510
That's another thing that bothered me about it.

5313
03:49:25,510 --> 03:49:26,590
Look how oomph it!

5314
03:49:26,750 --> 03:49:29,510
The warning went off, and I know I couldn't be over the limit.

5315
03:49:29,570 --> 03:49:30,750
How much do you weigh?

5316
03:49:31,210 --> 03:49:32,590
About 135.

5317
03:49:32,770 --> 03:49:33,450
Skinny legend!

5318
03:49:33,770 --> 03:49:36,470
But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.

5319
03:49:36,770 --> 03:49:37,730
It would take it to the next level.

5320
03:49:37,730 --> 03:49:37,850
The elevator was full of people!

5321
03:49:37,850 --> 03:49:38,370
Like, at least five people.

5322
03:49:38,370 --> 03:49:39,250
Five people!

5323
03:49:40,490 --> 03:49:41,610
Look out, Snake!

5324
03:49:42,250 --> 03:49:45,550
The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are in there with you!

5325
03:49:45,690 --> 03:49:46,610
Oh my god!

5326
03:49:50,590 --> 03:49:51,670
Oh, wait.

5327
03:49:51,830 --> 03:49:52,250
Hold on.

5328
03:49:52,350 --> 03:49:52,610
There we go.

5329
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:13,980
Oh, ouchie ouchie.

5330
03:50:13,980 --> 03:50:14,660
Who's hitting me?

5331
03:50:14,980 --> 03:50:15,640
Oh my god.

5332
03:50:18,380 --> 03:50:19,160
Oh, there we go.

5333
03:50:19,460 --> 03:50:20,140
Oh my god.

5334
03:50:20,280 --> 03:50:21,460
One of them gave me a ration.

5335
03:50:21,760 --> 03:50:22,160
Nice.

5336
03:50:23,280 --> 03:50:23,680
Oh.

5337
03:50:24,740 --> 03:50:28,190
Are you... oh, still?

5338
03:50:28,370 --> 03:50:29,230
Still alive?

5339
03:50:31,850 --> 03:50:32,990
How are you still alive?

5340
03:50:35,070 --> 03:50:35,470
Are

5341
03:50:39,330 --> 03:50:39,890
you dead now?

5342
03:50:40,210 --> 03:50:40,610
Finally.

5343
03:50:43,970 --> 03:50:44,970
Oh, chokehold's better.

5344
03:50:45,170 --> 03:50:45,850
You know, it's fine.

5345
03:50:46,670 --> 03:50:47,970
Then I got all these bullets.

5346
03:50:48,190 --> 03:50:48,990
I gotta use them.

5347
03:50:57,120 --> 03:50:58,540
I only used, like, half.

5348
03:50:59,340 --> 03:51:00,960
Then we got a free ration out of it.

5349
03:51:02,180 --> 03:51:04,180
Well, that was exciting, wasn't it?

5350
03:51:07,900 --> 03:51:10,960
More chaff, more chaff, more chaff.

5351
03:51:13,100 --> 03:51:17,860
Why does it feel like if this was MGS3, there would be a little frog in there for me to shoot?

5352
03:51:18,480 --> 03:51:19,380
You know what I mean.

5353
03:51:20,320 --> 03:51:20,680
Oh.

5354
03:51:21,000 --> 03:51:22,200
Another ration.

5355
03:51:23,680 --> 03:51:24,400
Itadakimasu.

5356
03:51:27,440 --> 03:51:27,800
Nice.

5357
03:51:28,880 --> 03:51:30,280
Yeah, a little keroutan.

5358
03:51:34,460 --> 03:51:35,180
Okay.

5359
03:51:38,400 --> 03:51:39,960
I almost just died.

5360
03:51:40,100 --> 03:51:41,620
I almost just died for real.

5361
03:51:41,700 --> 03:51:43,980
I almost just died.

5362
03:51:44,760 --> 03:51:45,360
Oh, no.

5363
03:51:48,760 --> 03:51:49,920
Holy cow.

5364
03:51:56,620 --> 03:51:58,340
This is so unfair.

5365
03:51:59,720 --> 03:52:01,360
Oh, you scared the shit out of me.

5366
03:52:01,360 --> 03:52:02,140
I'm sorry.

5367
03:52:03,380 --> 03:52:05,260
If only we can aim like twin snakes.

5368
03:52:05,380 --> 03:52:06,160
I know, right?

5369
03:52:06,540 --> 03:52:07,460
I wish.

5370
03:52:08,200 --> 03:52:09,260
Okay, I chaff.

5371
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:16,040
I wonder why they're giving me so much sniper ammo.

5372
03:52:16,400 --> 03:52:16,400
Oh!

5373
03:52:17,440 --> 03:52:18,460
Run, run, run, run, snake!

5374
03:52:18,900 --> 03:52:21,740
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, snake, go, snake, go, snake, go, snake!

5375
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:24,240
Oh God!

5376
03:52:26,720 --> 03:52:27,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5377
03:52:29,140 --> 03:52:30,340
Wait, oh my God, there's more!

5378
03:52:31,780 --> 03:52:32,580
Just go, just go.

5379
03:52:34,980 --> 03:52:35,540
We're fine.

5380
03:52:37,480 --> 03:52:37,760
Hehehe.

5381
03:52:43,990 --> 03:52:46,270
Woah, it's pitch darkness.

5382
03:52:58,770 --> 03:53:00,870
Can I see anything if I use the sniper?

5383
03:53:02,490 --> 03:53:03,370
Oh, I can.

5384
03:53:04,430 --> 03:53:05,530
That's actually pretty cool.

5385
03:53:07,110 --> 03:53:11,810
I don't remember if I Nikita Missiled this last time or if I properly did the fight, but...

5386
03:53:12,710 --> 03:53:14,490
I might just Nikita Missile.

5387
03:53:14,710 --> 03:53:15,050
I don't know.

5388
03:53:15,170 --> 03:53:15,690
We'll see.

5389
03:53:15,710 --> 03:53:16,550
We might do a mix of both.

5390
03:53:16,650 --> 03:53:17,030
Who knows.

5391
03:53:23,010 --> 03:53:24,950
Codec 140.66

5392
03:53:48,190 --> 03:53:49,490
Yay, music channel!

5393
03:54:04,100 --> 03:54:05,940
We got the other one in the first stream.

5394
03:54:08,820 --> 03:54:10,500
Thank you guys for telling me about these.

5395
03:54:10,580 --> 03:54:11,100
They're so cool.

5396
03:54:17,660 --> 03:54:18,180
Nice.

5397
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:20,200
Okay.

5398
03:54:22,860 --> 03:54:24,800
It looks like the weather is getting worse.

5399
03:54:25,080 --> 03:54:26,440
Try using your binoculars.

5400
03:54:26,620 --> 03:54:26,980
Oh yeah!

5401
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:28,080
What about the satellite data?

5402
03:54:28,380 --> 03:54:29,460
I'm sorry, Snake.

5403
03:54:29,680 --> 03:54:32,020
I can't see the entrance in the satellite photos either.

5404
03:54:32,280 --> 03:54:33,460
What about a heat source?

5405
03:54:33,720 --> 03:54:34,980
An exhaust pipe or something?

5406
03:54:35,340 --> 03:54:36,640
I can't confirm anything.

5407
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:40,440
Only that there are multiple heat sources to the southeast of your position.

5408
03:54:40,640 --> 03:54:43,120
That's probably just the burning wreckage from the Hind.

5409
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:46,480
Snake, you're in a big open space surrounded by water.

5410
03:54:46,500 --> 03:54:49,560
The entrance to the underground base should be somewhere in there.

5411
03:54:49,600 --> 03:54:50,160
Somewhere in there.

5412
03:54:50,160 --> 03:54:52,100
Stay close to the walls and you won't get lost.

5413
03:54:52,460 --> 03:54:52,980
Okay.

5414
03:54:53,200 --> 03:54:54,980
Snake, you're our only hope.

5415
03:54:55,200 --> 03:54:57,320
Please stop them from launching that nuke.

5416
03:54:58,000 --> 03:54:58,520
Okay.

5417
03:54:58,780 --> 03:55:00,480
Snake just stares at the music.

5418
03:55:00,480 --> 03:55:01,260
I know it's so funny.

5419
03:55:02,460 --> 03:55:05,140
Otacon, which direction is the underground base?

5420
03:55:05,560 --> 03:55:08,260
It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B.

5421
03:55:08,580 --> 03:55:10,620
The door is security level six.

5422
03:55:10,700 --> 03:55:11,000
Six.

5423
03:55:11,300 --> 03:55:12,660
The weather's terrible.

5424
03:55:12,840 --> 03:55:14,860
Make sure you don't get lost out there.

5425
03:55:15,260 --> 03:55:15,780
Snake?

5426
03:55:15,780 --> 03:55:16,420
I hear dogs.

5427
03:55:16,420 --> 03:55:18,540
I don't have to tell you, but it's bitter cold out there.

5428
03:55:18,540 --> 03:55:18,760
I hear dogs.

5429
03:55:19,080 --> 03:55:21,600
It'd be dangerous to stay out in the snowfield too long.

5430
03:55:27,800 --> 03:55:28,580
He's back!

5431
03:55:33,400 --> 03:55:33,920
Master!

5432
03:55:33,920 --> 03:55:36,080
You've recovered from your RBS!

5433
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:41,280
It may look pretty at first, but it'll severely limit your visibility.

5434
03:55:41,280 --> 03:55:41,640
Master's back!

5435
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:42,840
Be careful.

5436
03:55:45,780 --> 03:55:46,660
I'll be right back.

5437
03:55:47,560 --> 03:55:48,400
All right.

5438
03:55:48,520 --> 03:55:49,700
Let's get this over with.

5439
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:54,500
But also, is there anything around here?

5440
03:55:55,060 --> 03:55:57,740
I went through a couple of reactions, so...

5441
03:56:00,900 --> 03:56:02,020
Lucky me!

5442
03:56:16,780 --> 03:56:18,680
Snake, are you okay?

5443
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:19,480
I'm fine.

5444
03:56:19,680 --> 03:56:22,000
Otacon, were there any other stealth prototypes?

5445
03:56:22,540 --> 03:56:23,940
No, there were only five.

5446
03:56:24,360 --> 03:56:27,020
So, this isn't stealth camouflage, then?

5447
03:56:27,040 --> 03:56:27,760
Sniper.

5448
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:28,760
What are you talking about?

5449
03:56:29,020 --> 03:56:30,160
Someone's aiming at me.

5450
03:56:30,240 --> 03:56:31,620
In the middle of this blizzard.

5451
03:56:32,540 --> 03:56:33,200
It's her!

5452
03:56:34,360 --> 03:56:34,880
Wolf?

5453
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:36,500
Sniper Wolf?

5454
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:37,280
Sniper Wolf?

5455
03:56:37,480 --> 03:56:37,960
Yes, it's her.

5456
03:56:38,100 --> 03:56:39,280
It's definitely her.

5457
03:56:39,880 --> 03:56:42,320
Otacon, you sound like you're happy.

5458
03:56:42,320 --> 03:56:42,840
He's smiling.

5459
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:44,020
He's cheesing.

5460
03:56:44,260 --> 03:56:44,320
No, I'm not.

5461
03:56:44,780 --> 03:56:45,980
So, then what is it?

5462
03:56:46,580 --> 03:56:47,920
Oh, his glasses.

5463
03:56:48,380 --> 03:56:49,500
Snake, please don't kill her.

5464
03:56:49,780 --> 03:56:50,900
Are you insane?

5465
03:56:51,380 --> 03:56:51,900
Please!

5466
03:56:51,940 --> 03:56:52,460
She's a good person.

5467
03:56:52,460 --> 03:56:54,880
Master, we're back after a funny first life, not the toilet.

5468
03:56:55,460 --> 03:56:56,620
Listen to me, kid.

5469
03:56:56,780 --> 03:56:57,020
I'm going to get you out of here.

5470
03:56:57,020 --> 03:56:58,260
She's a merciless killer.

5471
03:56:58,800 --> 03:57:01,320
I can see you perfectly from up here.

5472
03:57:01,360 --> 03:57:02,440
She's so hot.

5473
03:57:02,560 --> 03:57:02,960
Look at her.

5474
03:57:03,900 --> 03:57:07,580
I told you, I never quit the hunt.

5475
03:57:08,100 --> 03:57:09,400
Now you're mine.

5476
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:10,440
Now you're mine.

5477
03:57:10,600 --> 03:57:12,040
Wolf, no, you can't.

5478
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:12,680
She's got that vocal fry.

5479
03:57:12,680 --> 03:57:14,460
Don't get between a wolf and his prey.

5480
03:57:14,880 --> 03:57:17,460
You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.

5481
03:57:17,960 --> 03:57:21,560
You see, women naturally make better soldiers.

5482
03:57:22,320 --> 03:57:23,940
Wolf, don't do this.

5483
03:57:25,300 --> 03:57:26,860
Snake, I'm near.

5484
03:57:26,880 --> 03:57:27,000
I'm near.

5485
03:57:31,280 --> 03:57:33,880
Why is her vocal fry so sexy, though?

5486
03:57:34,280 --> 03:57:35,060
Is that right?

5487
03:57:36,240 --> 03:57:39,020
Well, I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.

5488
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:41,420
Do you know what that is?

5489
03:57:42,320 --> 03:57:46,300
It's a bullet straight from my gun to your heart.

5490
03:57:46,600 --> 03:57:47,400
Please, Wolf.

5491
03:57:47,700 --> 03:57:48,780
Snake, no.

5492
03:57:49,200 --> 03:57:49,760
Quiet.

5493
03:57:50,000 --> 03:57:50,460
Snake.

5494
03:57:50,460 --> 03:57:51,540
Don't get in our way.

5495
03:57:51,980 --> 03:57:52,540
Snake, no.

5496
03:57:52,540 --> 03:57:54,340
Now I'm going to pay you back for Meryl.

5497
03:57:54,660 --> 03:57:55,220
Meryl.

5498
03:57:55,220 --> 03:57:56,760
You men are so weak.

5499
03:57:56,800 --> 03:57:56,980
Meryl.

5500
03:57:57,360 --> 03:57:57,700
You're weak.

5501
03:57:57,700 --> 03:57:59,860
You could never finish what you start.

5502
03:58:00,220 --> 03:58:01,200
That's what I'm about to do.

5503
03:58:01,340 --> 03:58:02,820
That's literally what I just said I was going to do.

5504
03:58:04,280 --> 03:58:04,620
Okay.

5505
03:58:04,720 --> 03:58:06,300
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

5506
03:58:06,420 --> 03:58:07,100
Run, run, run.

5507
03:58:07,320 --> 03:58:08,200
Oh, gosh.

5508
03:58:09,240 --> 03:58:09,580
Okay.

5509
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:12,560
There's, like, this truck up here.

5510
03:58:12,880 --> 03:58:13,520
Oh, shoot.

5511
03:58:16,260 --> 03:58:16,820
Oh, my God.

5512
03:58:16,980 --> 03:58:17,560
Oh, my God.

5513
03:58:17,700 --> 03:58:18,900
This maybe is a bad idea.

5514
03:58:20,600 --> 03:58:20,940
Oh.

5515
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:21,860
Okay.

5516
03:58:22,260 --> 03:58:22,780
Never mind.

5517
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:23,780
Anyway.

5518
03:58:25,840 --> 03:58:26,860
Let's just leave.

5519
03:58:26,920 --> 03:58:26,980
Oh, my God.

5520
03:58:26,980 --> 03:58:30,080
Let's just leave over here and get down.

5521
03:58:33,840 --> 03:58:35,880
If I just...

5522
03:58:35,880 --> 03:58:36,540
Okay.

5523
03:58:36,580 --> 03:58:38,900
First, I'm going to find her.

5524
03:58:40,540 --> 03:58:42,600
I'm going to find her.

5525
03:58:43,260 --> 03:58:44,240
Where is she at?

5526
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:46,340
Where are you at, girl?

5527
03:58:46,480 --> 03:58:47,120
Oh, there you are.

5528
03:58:47,240 --> 03:58:47,420
Okay.

5529
03:58:53,960 --> 03:58:54,380
That

5530
03:58:58,430 --> 03:58:59,770
one doesn't count, you guys.

5531
03:58:59,830 --> 03:59:01,010
That one doesn't count.

5532
03:59:01,010 --> 03:59:01,170
That doesn't count.

5533
03:59:06,910 --> 03:59:08,230
That's so silly.

5534
03:59:09,350 --> 03:59:10,750
Oh my goodness gracious.

5535
03:59:11,810 --> 03:59:12,870
That one doesn't count.

5536
03:59:17,140 --> 03:59:19,240
I don't actually remember how I did this before.

5537
03:59:19,320 --> 03:59:20,640
I think I hid behind...

5538
03:59:20,640 --> 03:59:22,220
here or something.

5539
03:59:22,680 --> 03:59:27,120
It even looks different, which is so cool.

5540
03:59:27,660 --> 03:59:29,160
Depending on where I'm at.

5541
03:59:29,480 --> 03:59:30,340
That's so awesome!

5542
03:59:33,820 --> 03:59:34,400
I'm going to hit all of this.

5543
03:59:45,430 --> 03:59:48,210
I can see you where you are.

5544
03:59:49,970 --> 03:59:50,930
I'm near.

5545
03:59:52,690 --> 03:59:53,730
I'm near.

5546
04:00:01,940 --> 04:00:03,500
Oh shoot, man!

5547
04:00:04,740 --> 04:00:06,320
I mean, don't shoot, man!

5548
04:00:14,200 --> 04:00:15,980
I never even got...

5549
04:00:15,980 --> 04:00:17,440
Wait, did this spawn a new ration?

5550
04:00:17,840 --> 04:00:18,300
Yippee!

5551
04:00:20,540 --> 04:00:21,500
Okay, alright.

5552
04:00:21,720 --> 04:00:23,080
I'm going to shoot Nikita.

5553
04:00:24,040 --> 04:00:25,200
What if I shoot it from here?

5554
04:00:26,800 --> 04:00:27,980
Can I not shoot it?

5555
04:00:28,620 --> 04:00:29,000
Oh.

5556
04:00:37,320 --> 04:00:38,060
Is that her?

5557
04:00:38,240 --> 04:00:38,580
Yep.

5558
04:00:45,120 --> 04:00:46,280
Okay, I have to find a way.

5559
04:00:52,790 --> 04:00:53,410
Explode into me!

5560
04:00:53,470 --> 04:00:55,030
Oh, because I un-equipped it.

5561
04:00:55,170 --> 04:00:58,700
Let's find a way around.

5562
04:01:02,480 --> 04:01:02,860
Maybe...

5563
04:01:05,460 --> 04:01:07,180
Wait, so she can't hit me.

5564
04:01:07,340 --> 04:01:08,640
Oh, there is no way around.

5565
04:01:09,580 --> 04:01:09,960
Interesting.

5566
04:01:09,960 --> 04:01:12,560
Okay, but she can't hit me while this is going.

5567
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:13,440
So...

5568
04:01:13,760 --> 04:01:15,860
If I just get up here...

5569
04:01:15,860 --> 04:01:16,260
Ouch.

5570
04:01:16,560 --> 04:01:17,480
If I even can.

5571
04:01:17,700 --> 04:01:18,320
Oh my god.

5572
04:01:18,820 --> 04:01:19,520
Oh my god.

5573
04:01:19,820 --> 04:01:22,240
Oh god.

5574
04:01:23,080 --> 04:01:23,840
Don't hit me.

5575
04:01:23,880 --> 04:01:24,280
Don't hit me.

5576
04:01:24,340 --> 04:01:24,660
Don't hit me.

5577
04:01:24,780 --> 04:01:31,740
You can go uphill if you've got speed.

5578
04:01:33,700 --> 04:01:34,140
I

5579
04:01:41,370 --> 04:01:49,230
don't know why the sniper missions are giving me so much trouble when literally, those were the easiest for me before.

5580
04:01:50,370 --> 04:01:51,790
I can't even climb...

5581
04:01:51,790 --> 04:01:52,830
crawl up this.

5582
04:01:54,630 --> 04:02:00,700
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

5583
04:02:00,700 --> 04:02:02,280
But I gotta be, like, super speed.

5584
04:02:02,380 --> 04:02:04,220
I gotta be, like, the speediest ever.

5585
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:06,240
Snake, come on.

5586
04:02:11,300 --> 04:02:13,120
I don't think I have a lot of dizisapan.

5587
04:02:13,360 --> 04:02:14,520
Yeah, I don't have a lot.

5588
04:02:15,940 --> 04:02:16,560
Uh-oh.

5589
04:02:16,880 --> 04:02:17,240
Gosh.

5590
04:02:17,680 --> 04:02:18,420
I don't even know where to go.

5591
04:02:18,440 --> 04:02:20,100
This is such a terrible location.

5592
04:02:21,520 --> 04:02:22,300
I don't even...

5593
04:02:22,300 --> 04:02:22,400
Oh.

5594
04:02:22,580 --> 04:02:22,700
Oh.

5595
04:02:32,320 --> 04:02:32,840
Stinger her.

5596
04:02:32,920 --> 04:02:33,480
It won't let you.

5597
04:02:33,520 --> 04:02:34,760
It even says...

5598
04:02:35,100 --> 04:02:35,300
Ha!

5599
04:02:35,860 --> 04:02:36,260
Cigarettes?

5600
04:02:36,260 --> 04:02:37,740
They don't work as well, though.

5601
04:02:37,780 --> 04:02:39,780
They work, but they don't work as well.

5602
04:02:47,260 --> 04:02:47,660
Hmm.

5603
04:02:47,660 --> 04:02:50,860
Maybe I just, like, stick around back here and kinda...

5604
04:02:52,780 --> 04:02:53,380
Oh, no.

5605
04:02:53,520 --> 04:02:54,900
Can't see anything from back here.

5606
04:02:56,380 --> 04:02:57,300
Oh, a little bit.

5607
04:02:57,400 --> 04:02:57,920
A little bit.

5608
04:02:58,980 --> 04:03:00,320
Actually, a lot of it.

5609
04:03:00,780 --> 04:03:02,240
I might be able to do it from over here.

5610
04:03:02,720 --> 04:03:03,660
If I run it.

5611
04:03:04,100 --> 04:03:05,020
Or if I...

5612
04:03:05,020 --> 04:03:06,460
How fast do I have to be?

5613
04:03:08,480 --> 04:03:10,500
Then Akira can go up from the sides.

5614
04:03:14,100 --> 04:03:14,660
I can?

5615
04:03:14,940 --> 04:03:15,620
I don't believe you.

5616
04:03:21,020 --> 04:03:22,720
From the right little mountain?

5617
04:03:25,480 --> 04:03:25,880
These?

5618
04:03:26,140 --> 04:03:27,300
Like, this?

5619
04:03:27,300 --> 04:03:30,660
Like, if I shoot it right here, it'll go up.

5620
04:03:30,740 --> 04:03:31,460
The mountain.

5621
04:03:31,860 --> 04:03:32,700
Try it out.

5622
04:03:32,800 --> 04:03:33,080
You know what?

5623
04:03:33,080 --> 04:03:33,620
I will try.

5624
04:03:33,780 --> 04:03:34,280
I will try.

5625
04:03:45,900 --> 04:03:46,420
Sorry.

5626
04:03:48,520 --> 04:03:49,040
Sorry.

5627
04:03:56,370 --> 04:03:57,790
I accidentally unequipped it.

5628
04:03:57,910 --> 04:04:04,770
I've been having that problem all day where I keep pressing R1 to view in first person instead of triangle.

5629
04:04:08,630 --> 04:04:09,150
Okay.

5630
04:04:09,150 --> 04:04:10,550
I won't unequip it.

5631
04:04:11,250 --> 04:04:11,770
Oh.

5632
04:04:11,810 --> 04:04:12,230
Shit.

5633
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:22,720
Not that way.

5634
04:04:22,800 --> 04:04:23,160
What are you...

5635
04:04:23,160 --> 04:04:23,500
Wait.

5636
04:04:23,600 --> 04:04:24,600
What are we talking about then?

5637
04:04:24,780 --> 04:04:25,160
Okay.

5638
04:04:25,300 --> 04:04:25,840
Hold on.

5639
04:04:28,140 --> 04:04:28,580
Oh.

5640
04:04:28,580 --> 04:04:29,440
It went over.

5641
04:04:31,760 --> 04:04:32,200
Okay.

5642
04:04:32,340 --> 04:04:32,560
Okay.

5643
04:04:32,620 --> 04:04:32,840
Okay.

5644
04:04:34,600 --> 04:04:35,780
We can do it from here.

5645
04:04:38,000 --> 04:04:38,580
It worked.

5646
04:04:39,520 --> 04:04:39,960
Oh.

5647
04:04:39,960 --> 04:04:41,120
Can I get it right now?

5648
04:04:41,320 --> 04:04:41,540
Wait.

5649
04:04:41,580 --> 04:04:42,860
She's waiting for me.

5650
04:04:43,220 --> 04:04:44,040
You bitch.

5651
04:04:48,260 --> 04:04:49,120
She's a monster.

5652
04:04:49,420 --> 04:04:49,800
She's a monster.

5653
04:04:49,800 --> 04:04:49,960
She's a monster.

5654
04:04:50,860 --> 04:04:51,900
How did she live?

5655
04:04:54,560 --> 04:04:59,300
Well, I just wasted one, but we can maybe get her with the amount.

5656
04:04:59,740 --> 04:05:03,380
Actually, I think I can start the cutscene.

5657
04:05:03,580 --> 04:05:03,860
There we go.

5658
04:05:12,440 --> 04:05:13,800
Snake, are you okay?

5659
04:05:14,080 --> 04:05:15,500
I'm not okay, actually.

5660
04:05:15,540 --> 04:05:17,580
I'm really scared at how she...

5661
04:05:18,420 --> 04:05:20,260
she didn't die to that.

5662
04:05:21,220 --> 04:05:22,560
I'm actually quite scared.

5663
04:05:26,200 --> 04:05:26,680
Okay.

5664
04:05:26,680 --> 04:05:27,160
Sorry.

5665
04:05:27,320 --> 04:05:29,440
This is an annoying one to skip, isn't it?

5666
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:32,080
I think I, like, literally first tried her last time.

5667
04:05:32,180 --> 04:05:33,720
So, another thought.

5668
04:05:33,800 --> 04:05:33,980
Okay.

5669
04:05:35,440 --> 04:05:35,920
Oh.

5670
04:05:36,140 --> 04:05:36,620
Shit.

5671
04:05:39,260 --> 04:05:39,740
There

5672
04:05:43,500 --> 04:05:44,080
we go.

5673
04:05:44,180 --> 04:05:44,620
Nice.

5674
04:05:57,430 --> 04:05:57,870
Enemy.

5675
04:05:58,710 --> 04:05:59,470
That's so cute.

5676
04:06:01,970 --> 04:06:03,450
You don't see it coming, do you?

5677
04:06:12,530 --> 04:06:13,210
She's running.

5678
04:06:19,590 --> 04:06:20,030
You!

5679
04:06:20,890 --> 04:06:21,670
Ah, you!

5680
04:06:23,630 --> 04:06:24,830
She got me, you guys.

5681
04:06:24,950 --> 04:06:25,990
Oh, I can use the stinger.

5682
04:06:26,610 --> 04:06:27,870
I don't know why I wouldn't...

5683
04:06:27,870 --> 04:06:28,090
Go

5684
04:06:40,300 --> 04:06:41,520
up the side.

5685
04:06:42,020 --> 04:06:43,140
Go up the side.

5686
04:06:43,360 --> 04:06:43,740
Adjust.

5687
04:06:44,160 --> 04:06:45,940
Oh, this is so... this is so... no.

5688
04:06:45,940 --> 04:06:47,780
You guys, this is not... this is not gonna work.

5689
04:06:48,880 --> 04:06:50,480
This is not gonna work for me.

5690
04:06:50,860 --> 04:06:51,780
Oh, man.

5691
04:06:51,920 --> 04:06:52,980
This is not gonna work for me.

5692
04:06:56,660 --> 04:06:57,400
Where is she?

5693
04:06:58,340 --> 04:06:59,320
Where is she at?

5694
04:07:00,320 --> 04:07:01,180
Where is she at?

5695
04:07:06,340 --> 04:07:07,220
Where are you?

5696
04:07:07,900 --> 04:07:08,300
Please!

5697
04:07:22,860 --> 04:07:24,240
You're gonna waste my medicine.

5698
04:07:27,100 --> 04:07:27,500
Where?

5699
04:07:27,560 --> 04:07:28,400
Where the hell?

5700
04:07:31,460 --> 04:07:33,080
Sniper wolf, stop being a coward!

5701
04:07:34,920 --> 04:07:35,400
What the?

5702
04:07:35,500 --> 04:07:35,780
Oh.

5703
04:07:43,620 --> 04:07:44,300
Oh my god.

5704
04:07:44,400 --> 04:07:44,800
Oh my god.

5705
04:07:45,060 --> 04:07:45,700
Oh my god.

5706
04:07:45,740 --> 04:07:46,020
Oh my god.

5707
04:07:49,920 --> 04:07:51,320
I can't move.

5708
04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:52,120
I can't move.

5709
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:55,440
I saw her aiming at me, though.

5710
04:07:56,980 --> 04:07:57,620
From where?

5711
04:07:57,860 --> 04:07:58,600
Maybe she's over...

5712
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:03,820
Hello?

5713
04:08:04,020 --> 04:08:05,780
Wouldn't you move if you can't see me?

5714
04:08:07,540 --> 04:08:08,200
Oh my god.

5715
04:08:08,240 --> 04:08:09,060
I'm so shaky.

5716
04:08:09,560 --> 04:08:10,280
I'm nervous.

5717
04:08:10,920 --> 04:08:11,320
Oh!

5718
04:08:11,340 --> 04:08:11,640
Ah!

5719
04:08:13,700 --> 04:08:14,240
I know!

5720
04:08:14,580 --> 04:08:15,420
I wasted my whole disappearance!

5721
04:08:17,400 --> 04:08:18,120
Because of you.

5722
04:08:21,800 --> 04:08:22,300
Get her!

5723
04:08:22,400 --> 04:08:23,020
Get her face!

5724
04:08:23,140 --> 04:08:23,540
Get her face!

5725
04:08:33,800 --> 04:08:34,840
I'm gonna get her arm.

5726
04:08:36,500 --> 04:08:37,540
Okay, that doesn't work.

5727
04:08:39,560 --> 04:08:40,000
Sure.

5728
04:08:40,200 --> 04:08:40,580
Sure.

5729
04:08:40,680 --> 04:08:41,280
Sniper wolf.

5730
04:08:41,420 --> 04:08:41,600
Sure.

5731
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:42,640
Oh my god.

5732
04:08:44,160 --> 04:08:44,600
Finally!

5733
04:08:44,880 --> 04:08:45,680
Good lord.

5734
04:08:46,400 --> 04:08:47,420
Wasting so much...

5735
04:08:50,560 --> 04:08:51,700
Wasting so much ammo.

5736
04:09:03,360 --> 04:09:04,120
Cigarettes, please.

5737
04:09:04,440 --> 04:09:05,100
Save me.

5738
04:09:06,060 --> 04:09:06,900
Oh no, wait.

5739
04:09:07,260 --> 04:09:08,600
What if I get hit again?

5740
04:09:08,660 --> 04:09:09,040
I'll die.

5741
04:09:09,280 --> 04:09:09,820
Oh gosh.

5742
04:09:09,980 --> 04:09:10,460
Okay, hold on.

5743
04:09:11,000 --> 04:09:11,920
This is not good.

5744
04:09:12,040 --> 04:09:12,540
This is not good.

5745
04:09:13,440 --> 04:09:13,840
Stop!

5746
04:09:13,840 --> 04:09:14,460
Stop running!

5747
04:09:14,920 --> 04:09:15,320
Stop!

5748
04:09:15,560 --> 04:09:16,160
Stop running!

5749
04:09:16,580 --> 04:09:17,180
There we go.

5750
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:18,420
I can still hit her.

5751
04:09:18,640 --> 04:09:19,660
I'm just a little shaky.

5752
04:09:19,840 --> 04:09:21,100
I'm just a little rusty, you guys.

5753
04:09:21,140 --> 04:09:22,880
I'm just a little... I'm looking...

5754
04:09:22,880 --> 04:09:24,640
I'm looking directly at a beautiful woman.

5755
04:09:24,700 --> 04:09:25,900
Of course I would be so...

5756
04:09:26,340 --> 04:09:27,480
I would be so nervous.

5757
04:09:27,800 --> 04:09:28,440
Of course.

5758
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:30,200
Not even a Dezipam can help me.

5759
04:09:30,200 --> 04:09:31,560
Here, you guys, I'm...

5760
04:09:32,460 --> 04:09:33,260
I'm... I'm...

5761
04:09:34,580 --> 04:09:35,540
Yeah, that's right.

5762
04:09:36,480 --> 04:09:37,340
I'm... I'm hopeless.

5763
04:09:39,060 --> 04:09:39,740
I'm hopeless.

5764
04:09:41,380 --> 04:09:42,200
I'm just a...

5765
04:09:42,200 --> 04:09:43,240
I'm just a snake in love.

5766
04:09:43,860 --> 04:09:45,900
Snakes don't even have hands, so, you know what?

5767
04:09:46,860 --> 04:09:47,660
Give me credit.

5768
04:09:48,220 --> 04:09:49,300
Just screw these, okay?

5769
04:09:50,920 --> 04:09:51,320
Oh!

5770
04:09:51,700 --> 04:09:52,600
Oh, I almost got her.

5771
04:09:54,300 --> 04:09:57,260
I only have three bullets left and then I'm gonna have to run and grab more.

5772
04:09:57,920 --> 04:09:58,640
I only have three bullets left and then I'm gonna have to run and grab more.

5773
04:09:58,640 --> 04:09:58,980
Come on, wolf!

5774
04:09:59,200 --> 04:09:59,680
Come here!

5775
04:10:01,080 --> 04:10:02,160
I mean...

5776
04:10:02,900 --> 04:10:03,440
Wolf!

5777
04:10:03,440 --> 04:10:04,080
Wolfy wolf!

5778
04:10:05,020 --> 04:10:05,560
Yeah!

5779
04:10:06,860 --> 04:10:08,020
I'm a-gaming!

5780
04:10:08,120 --> 04:10:08,720
I'm gaming!

5781
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:09,980
Oh god.

5782
04:10:11,060 --> 04:10:13,140
We're gaming without the Dezipam!

5783
04:10:13,960 --> 04:10:15,040
Oh, sheesh.

5784
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:16,780
Oh my god.

5785
04:10:16,900 --> 04:10:17,340
Oh my god.

5786
04:10:17,480 --> 04:10:18,180
Oh my god.

5787
04:10:18,920 --> 04:10:19,460
Okay.

5788
04:10:20,460 --> 04:10:22,640
I think it's time for me to...

5789
04:10:22,640 --> 04:10:23,620
run.

5790
04:10:24,760 --> 04:10:28,820
We'll go back to that spot in a second after I grab some ammo.

5791
04:10:29,380 --> 04:10:29,920
Ammo!

5792
04:10:30,200 --> 04:10:30,540
Oh!

5793
04:10:31,760 --> 04:10:32,200
Okay.

5794
04:10:32,300 --> 04:10:32,980
Only five.

5795
04:10:33,360 --> 04:10:33,960
That's fine.

5796
04:10:35,160 --> 04:10:35,860
I don't mind.

5797
04:10:36,920 --> 04:10:38,240
I think there was some more up here.

5798
04:10:39,220 --> 04:10:39,660
Yep.

5799
04:10:39,660 --> 04:10:40,100
Okay.

5800
04:10:40,200 --> 04:10:40,800
Thank you.

5801
04:10:41,340 --> 04:10:42,920
I'm back in position now.

5802
04:10:43,660 --> 04:10:44,100
Okay.

5803
04:10:44,160 --> 04:10:44,560
Where'd you go?

5804
04:10:44,660 --> 04:10:45,160
Where'd you go?

5805
04:10:45,340 --> 04:10:46,300
Where'd you go, pretty lady?

5806
04:10:47,500 --> 04:10:48,820
Don't shoot at me.

5807
04:10:48,900 --> 04:10:49,200
Okay.

5808
04:10:52,300 --> 04:10:53,180
Oh, shoot.

5809
04:10:56,180 --> 04:10:56,900
No, no.

5810
04:10:57,060 --> 04:10:57,880
Controller this way.

5811
04:10:57,960 --> 04:10:58,860
Controller this way.

5812
04:10:59,120 --> 04:11:00,020
Controller this way.

5813
04:11:02,440 --> 04:11:03,080
Oh, gosh.

5814
04:11:03,200 --> 04:11:03,580
You know what?

5815
04:11:03,620 --> 04:11:07,840
I'm gonna use the rations and then I'm gonna go to the cigarettes.

5816
04:11:07,980 --> 04:11:08,420
There we go.

5817
04:11:08,540 --> 04:11:08,800
Okay.

5818
04:11:10,560 --> 04:11:11,020
Come here.

5819
04:11:11,220 --> 04:11:12,100
Come here, pretty lady.

5820
04:11:13,120 --> 04:11:13,520
Come here.

5821
04:11:15,780 --> 04:11:16,520
I'm kind of a genius.

5822
04:11:17,100 --> 04:11:17,940
I'm kind of a genius.

5823
04:11:20,440 --> 04:11:21,160
Oh, gosh.

5824
04:11:21,340 --> 04:11:23,440
The cigarettes don't help very much, you guys.

5825
04:11:26,180 --> 04:11:26,780
So close.

5826
04:11:27,280 --> 04:11:27,800
So close.

5827
04:11:27,820 --> 04:11:28,120
So close.

5828
04:11:28,160 --> 04:11:28,560
Oh my god.

5829
04:11:28,580 --> 04:11:29,560
They don't help very much at all.

5830
04:11:29,560 --> 04:11:32,780
Anybody who says that they help so much is a liar.

5831
04:11:32,980 --> 04:11:34,440
Oh, I was right in position.

5832
04:11:34,500 --> 04:11:34,800
Please.

5833
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:37,080
I got...

5834
04:11:39,410 --> 04:11:41,170
Look at me and my smokes.

5835
04:11:42,670 --> 04:11:44,890
Prevail in the rematch against Sniperwolf.

5836
04:11:47,270 --> 04:11:47,790
Yippee.

5837
04:11:49,650 --> 04:11:50,170
Yippee.

5838
04:11:52,150 --> 04:11:56,410
No, the first one didn't count, you guys.

5839
04:11:56,730 --> 04:11:58,270
The first one didn't count.

5840
04:11:58,510 --> 04:11:59,390
I don't remember even...

5841
04:11:59,390 --> 04:12:00,490
Oh, how did I die?

5842
04:12:00,570 --> 04:12:01,170
I don't even remember.

5843
04:12:03,590 --> 04:12:04,790
Oh, we go straight to her.

5844
04:12:05,130 --> 04:12:05,670
Cutscene time.

5845
04:12:05,750 --> 04:12:06,670
I wanna explore a little.

5846
04:12:07,950 --> 04:12:08,490
Oh, no.

5847
04:12:09,290 --> 04:12:10,410
I'm gonna be so sad.

5848
04:12:30,030 --> 04:12:30,570
Concentrating.

5849
04:12:38,130 --> 04:12:39,530
I am longshot.

5850
04:12:41,470 --> 04:12:43,270
You cannot save me.

5851
04:12:43,310 --> 04:12:43,850
I did that.

5852
04:12:44,290 --> 04:12:44,830
Gosh.

5853
04:12:45,010 --> 04:12:45,550
I'm sorry.

5854
04:12:45,690 --> 04:12:45,970
Please.

5855
04:12:49,530 --> 04:12:51,170
Just finish me quick.

5856
04:12:54,730 --> 04:12:56,050
I am a Gurd.

5857
04:12:57,830 --> 04:13:01,750
I have always dreamed of a peaceful place like this.

5858
04:13:02,050 --> 04:13:03,210
This is a nice place to die.

5859
04:13:03,230 --> 04:13:03,450
A Gurd.

5860
04:13:04,910 --> 04:13:05,890
That's why you're called Wolf.

5861
04:13:07,410 --> 04:13:09,650
I was born on a battlefield.

5862
04:13:11,270 --> 04:13:12,810
Raised on a battlefield.

5863
04:13:13,270 --> 04:13:16,270
I saw gunfire, sirens, and screams.

5864
04:13:17,670 --> 04:13:19,630
They were my lullabies.

5865
04:13:22,070 --> 04:13:24,890
Hunted like dogs, day after day.

5866
04:13:26,490 --> 04:13:28,690
Driven from our ragged shelters.

5867
04:13:30,680 --> 04:13:33,150
That was my life.

5868
04:13:36,390 --> 04:13:44,330
Each morning I'd wake up and find a few more of my family or friends still beside me.

5869
04:13:46,630 --> 04:13:53,310
I'd stare at the morning sun and pray to make it through the day.

5870
04:13:54,990 --> 04:13:59,390
The governments of the world turned a blind eye to our misery.

5871
04:14:00,950 --> 04:14:04,450
But then he appeared.

5872
04:14:04,910 --> 04:14:05,930
Big Boss.

5873
04:14:06,210 --> 04:14:07,430
My hero.

5874
04:14:11,010 --> 04:14:11,690
Saladin.

5875
04:14:11,690 --> 04:14:12,370
Saladin.

5876
04:14:13,510 --> 04:14:15,670
He took me away from all that.

5877
04:14:17,170 --> 04:14:17,850
Saladin?

5878
04:14:17,850 --> 04:14:19,330
You mean Big Boss?

5879
04:14:19,930 --> 04:14:21,530
I became a sniper.

5880
04:14:23,410 --> 04:14:24,090
Hidden.

5881
04:14:24,530 --> 04:14:25,210
Saladman.

5882
04:14:25,450 --> 04:14:28,130
Watching everything through a rifle scope.

5883
04:14:29,770 --> 04:14:31,470
Now I could see war.

5884
04:14:31,790 --> 04:14:35,250
Not from the inside, but from the outside.

5885
04:14:35,870 --> 04:14:40,790
As an observer, I watched the brutality.

5886
04:14:41,150 --> 04:14:41,590
Caesar Saladin.

5887
04:14:42,610 --> 04:14:44,050
The stupidity.

5888
04:14:44,050 --> 04:14:44,570
Stop.

5889
04:14:44,570 --> 04:14:45,490
Stop ruining the scene.

5890
04:14:45,750 --> 04:14:47,950
Of mankind through the scope of my rifle.

5891
04:14:50,010 --> 04:14:53,610
I joined this group of revolutionaries.

5892
04:14:55,590 --> 04:14:58,570
To take my revenge on the world.

5893
04:15:02,110 --> 04:15:02,670
But...

5894
04:15:04,910 --> 04:15:07,910
I have shamed myself and my people.

5895
04:15:08,510 --> 04:15:11,070
Big Boss really likes snipers, doesn't he?

5896
04:15:11,210 --> 04:15:13,370
I am no longer the wolf I was born to be.

5897
04:15:14,610 --> 04:15:18,750
In the name of vengeance, I sought my body and my soul.

5898
04:15:28,400 --> 04:15:29,840
Wolves are noble animals.

5899
04:15:31,500 --> 04:15:32,680
They're not like dogs.

5900
04:15:35,380 --> 04:15:38,660
On Yupik, the word for wolf is keglynek.

5901
04:15:38,840 --> 04:15:41,220
The Aleuts revere them as honorable cousins.

5902
04:15:41,660 --> 04:15:45,360
They call mercenaries like us dogs of war.

5903
04:15:46,540 --> 04:15:47,340
It's true.

5904
04:15:47,800 --> 04:15:50,100
We're all for sale at some price or another.

5905
04:15:50,400 --> 04:15:51,660
But you're different.

5906
04:15:53,360 --> 04:15:53,960
Untamed.

5907
04:15:53,960 --> 04:15:54,560
Solitary.

5908
04:15:54,880 --> 04:15:56,040
You're no dog.

5909
04:15:56,620 --> 04:15:57,620
You're a wolf.

5910
04:15:58,080 --> 04:15:59,780
Who are you?

5911
04:15:59,980 --> 04:16:01,120
He takes such like...

5912
04:16:02,980 --> 04:16:06,260
He's so compassionate, even for the other team, you know?

5913
04:16:06,380 --> 04:16:07,660
You spared Meryl's life.

5914
04:16:09,660 --> 04:16:10,260
She...

5915
04:16:10,260 --> 04:16:12,300
She was never my real target.

5916
04:16:12,640 --> 04:16:14,580
I don't kill for sport.

5917
04:16:15,380 --> 04:16:16,220
Rest easy.

5918
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:20,060
You'll die as the proud wolf you are.

5919
04:16:23,340 --> 04:16:24,760
I finally understand.

5920
04:16:26,260 --> 04:16:28,360
I wasn't waiting to kill people.

5921
04:16:32,070 --> 04:16:34,430
I was waiting for someone to kill me.

5922
04:16:36,990 --> 04:16:38,550
A man like you.

5923
04:16:39,710 --> 04:16:41,290
A man like you.

5924
04:16:41,290 --> 04:16:42,230
You're a hero.

5925
04:16:42,770 --> 04:16:43,910
You're a hero.

5926
04:16:43,910 --> 04:16:46,870
Please, set me free.

5927
04:16:48,770 --> 04:16:50,450
Please, set me free.

5928
04:16:51,090 --> 04:16:54,330
I love you.

5929
04:17:06,490 --> 04:17:07,530
What is it?

5930
04:17:09,750 --> 04:17:10,710
My gun.

5931
04:17:11,490 --> 04:17:12,610
Give it to me.

5932
04:17:14,870 --> 04:17:15,710
Don't trip.

5933
04:17:15,910 --> 04:17:16,970
She's part of me.

5934
04:17:27,890 --> 04:17:28,990
Everyone's here now.

5935
04:17:33,060 --> 04:17:36,480
It's probably best that she doesn't care about Otakon, you know?

5936
04:17:37,620 --> 04:17:38,180
Just...

5937
04:17:38,180 --> 04:17:40,300
Just be more painful for him.

5938
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:40,560
Set me free.

5939
04:17:42,640 --> 04:17:43,200
No!

5940
04:18:00,620 --> 04:18:01,180
Snake.

5941
04:18:01,180 --> 04:18:01,320
Think.

5942
04:18:02,380 --> 04:18:04,740
You said that love could bloom on the battlefield.

5943
04:18:07,260 --> 04:18:08,960
But I couldn't save her.

5944
04:18:11,560 --> 04:18:12,620
What are you doing?

5945
04:18:14,700 --> 04:18:15,220
No.

5946
04:18:15,520 --> 04:18:17,020
We're turning it to its owner.

5947
04:18:17,220 --> 04:18:18,780
I don't need a handkerchief.

5948
04:18:20,040 --> 04:18:20,560
Why?

5949
04:18:21,000 --> 04:18:23,020
I don't have any more tears to shed.

5950
04:18:27,400 --> 04:18:29,020
I'm going to the underground base.

5951
04:18:29,020 --> 04:18:30,340
We're out of time.

5952
04:18:31,440 --> 04:18:32,200
I know.

5953
04:18:32,560 --> 04:18:34,200
You'll have to protect yourself now.

5954
04:18:34,380 --> 04:18:35,560
Don't trust anyone.

5955
04:18:36,020 --> 04:18:40,380
If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whole place will probably be bombed to hell.

5956
04:18:41,740 --> 04:18:42,260
Yeah.

5957
04:18:42,540 --> 04:18:44,000
We might not meet again.

5958
04:18:47,060 --> 04:18:48,720
I'll hang on to my codec.

5959
04:18:48,820 --> 04:18:50,220
I want to keep helping.

5960
04:18:51,220 --> 04:18:52,480
You can leave anytime.

5961
04:18:53,500 --> 04:18:54,740
Get a head start.

5962
04:18:54,960 --> 04:18:56,540
A head start on your new life.

5963
04:18:57,640 --> 04:18:58,920
How is he supposed to leave?

5964
04:18:59,480 --> 04:19:01,260
How is he supposed to leave?

5965
04:19:01,260 --> 04:19:02,580
This part is so good.

5966
04:19:06,860 --> 04:19:07,420
Snake!

5967
04:19:09,260 --> 04:19:10,940
What was she fighting for?

5968
04:19:12,100 --> 04:19:12,720
What was she fighting for?

5969
04:19:12,740 --> 04:19:14,380
What am I fighting for?

5970
04:19:14,880 --> 04:19:16,660
What are you fighting for?

5971
04:19:19,580 --> 04:19:22,260
If we make it through this, I'll tell you.

5972
04:19:22,540 --> 04:19:22,580
I'll tell you.

5973
04:19:24,140 --> 04:19:24,700
Okay.

5974
04:19:24,700 --> 04:19:24,880
Okay.

5975
04:19:29,180 --> 04:19:29,860
Okay.

5976
04:19:30,160 --> 04:19:30,600
Okay.

5977
04:19:30,620 --> 04:19:32,180
I'll be searching too.

5978
04:19:34,640 --> 04:19:36,080
You have to ruin it.

5979
04:19:36,080 --> 04:19:37,440
All the cards are just stupid.

5980
04:19:37,780 --> 04:19:38,400
Okay.

5981
04:19:45,980 --> 04:19:48,960
That scene gets me every time, you guys.

5982
04:19:51,700 --> 04:19:52,380
Man.

5983
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:53,060
Man.

5984
04:19:55,520 --> 04:19:56,200
It's so bad.

5985
04:19:56,280 --> 04:19:59,820
If I say I was reminded of the barking noises every time everyone...

5986
04:19:59,820 --> 04:20:00,140
Wait.

5987
04:20:00,200 --> 04:20:02,760
Barking noises everyone made at Off-Clyde when hearing the wolves howl.

5988
04:20:02,760 --> 04:20:03,920
Shut up!

5989
04:20:03,960 --> 04:20:04,260
No!

5990
04:20:06,140 --> 04:20:06,580
No!

5991
04:20:08,400 --> 04:20:08,840
Okay.

5992
04:20:09,000 --> 04:20:10,460
I have no more tears to shed.

5993
04:20:10,500 --> 04:20:11,120
I'm just like Snake.

5994
04:20:11,800 --> 04:20:12,600
I'm not crying.

5995
04:20:12,780 --> 04:20:13,340
I'm fine.

5996
04:20:14,840 --> 04:20:15,780
I'm not crying.

5997
04:20:15,980 --> 04:20:16,800
You're crying.

5998
04:20:18,580 --> 04:20:19,020
Wait.

5999
04:20:19,020 --> 04:20:19,720
What is it?

6000
04:20:19,760 --> 04:20:19,880
Oh.

6001
04:20:19,900 --> 04:20:20,160
Seven.

6002
04:20:20,780 --> 04:20:21,500
Oh gosh.

6003
04:20:21,560 --> 04:20:22,140
She scared me.

6004
04:20:28,850 --> 04:20:29,810
It's kind of like...

6005
04:20:29,810 --> 04:20:30,370
It's...

6006
04:20:30,370 --> 04:20:34,850
I think with her face covered, it's even scarier.

6007
04:20:35,110 --> 04:20:35,250
You know?

6008
04:20:35,470 --> 04:20:37,130
How many tissues did it take?

6009
04:20:38,950 --> 04:20:39,450
So...

6010
04:20:39,450 --> 04:20:41,890
Only that angle right there?

6011
04:20:46,540 --> 04:20:47,220
This one?

6012
04:20:49,100 --> 04:20:51,260
I like that we can't see Snake's face though.

6013
04:20:52,660 --> 04:20:54,100
A little dramatic, you know?

6014
04:20:58,370 --> 04:20:58,870
Yeah.

6015
04:20:58,910 --> 04:20:59,170
Aye!

6016
04:20:59,250 --> 04:20:59,710
Aye!

6017
04:20:59,770 --> 04:21:00,250
Aye!

6018
04:21:01,190 --> 04:21:01,690
Yep.

6019
04:21:04,490 --> 04:21:05,090
I...

6020
04:21:05,830 --> 04:21:07,010
I remember you.

6021
04:21:08,290 --> 04:21:09,670
I remember you.

6022
04:21:10,530 --> 04:21:11,130
Okay.

6023
04:21:11,150 --> 04:21:11,410
Hold on.

6024
04:21:11,990 --> 04:21:12,590
Oh.

6025
04:21:12,690 --> 04:21:13,830
I need to have my key.

6026
04:21:13,950 --> 04:21:14,570
To open it.

6027
04:21:16,530 --> 04:21:17,130
Okay.

6028
04:21:17,590 --> 04:21:18,550
Slip inside.

6029
04:21:19,430 --> 04:21:20,310
Slip inside.

6030
04:21:21,430 --> 04:21:22,170
Oh wait.

6031
04:21:22,210 --> 04:21:22,650
It doesn't matter.

6032
04:21:22,750 --> 04:21:23,410
I'm crouched.

6033
04:21:24,490 --> 04:21:25,090
Yeah.

6034
04:21:25,090 --> 04:21:25,690
Yeah.

6035
04:21:25,790 --> 04:21:26,170
Yeah.

6036
04:21:28,690 --> 04:21:29,590
Oh no.

6037
04:21:31,130 --> 04:21:32,330
More disabowm.

6038
04:21:32,790 --> 04:21:33,630
Stun grenade.

6039
04:21:33,890 --> 04:21:34,130
And ration.

6040
04:21:34,670 --> 04:21:35,390
Oh look.

6041
04:21:35,470 --> 04:21:36,110
You can see them.

6042
04:21:36,370 --> 04:21:37,130
That's so cool.

6043
04:21:37,230 --> 04:21:39,530
I never noticed you were able to...

6044
04:21:39,530 --> 04:21:40,210
Oh gosh.

6045
04:21:44,890 --> 04:21:45,710
Snake out.

6046
04:21:46,950 --> 04:21:47,910
I thought...

6047
04:21:50,800 --> 04:21:51,280
Wait.

6048
04:21:51,360 --> 04:21:52,800
I thought I wasn't full.

6049
04:21:53,000 --> 04:21:53,740
I just looked.

6050
04:21:55,300 --> 04:21:56,040
Oh wait.

6051
04:21:56,120 --> 04:21:56,900
Those are the claymores.

6052
04:21:57,000 --> 04:21:57,920
I was looking at the C4.

6053
04:21:58,020 --> 04:21:58,300
My bad.

6054
04:21:58,680 --> 04:21:59,160
Okay.

6055
04:22:09,300 --> 04:22:10,700
I can't trust anything.

6056
04:22:19,400 --> 04:22:20,580
Lots of bullets.

6057
04:22:21,460 --> 04:22:22,540
Lots of bullets.

6058
04:22:23,080 --> 04:22:23,180
Lots of bullets.

6059
04:22:23,740 --> 04:22:25,620
We have these old graphics in the room.

6060
04:22:26,000 --> 04:22:27,360
Where do we see...

6061
04:22:28,140 --> 04:22:28,960
Behind D?

6062
04:22:31,380 --> 04:22:31,860
Oop.

6063
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:34,820
What's in there though?

6064
04:22:40,180 --> 04:22:41,180
Go to the bottom one?

6065
04:22:41,320 --> 04:22:41,480
Okay.

6066
04:22:41,580 --> 04:22:42,220
Bottom corner.

6067
04:22:49,650 --> 04:22:50,130
Oh!

6068
04:22:50,150 --> 04:22:50,630
There's a ration.

6069
04:23:00,650 --> 04:23:01,690
Do I go up here?

6070
04:23:01,990 --> 04:23:02,470
Oh.

6071
04:23:02,510 --> 04:23:02,790
Oh.

6072
04:23:03,670 --> 04:23:04,910
Can I see it from...

6073
04:23:05,630 --> 04:23:06,350
Oh my god.

6074
04:23:06,390 --> 04:23:06,630
Snake.

6075
04:23:07,450 --> 04:23:08,250
Just climb.

6076
04:23:10,270 --> 04:23:11,070
Like from here?

6077
04:23:16,670 --> 04:23:17,150
Yeah.

6078
04:23:17,310 --> 04:23:17,630
I'm checking.

6079
04:23:17,870 --> 04:23:18,790
Press against the wall?

6080
04:23:23,510 --> 04:23:24,710
With the tree in view.

6081
04:23:28,050 --> 04:23:28,770
This tree?

6082
04:23:34,860 --> 04:23:36,380
It's so specific, right?

6083
04:23:37,960 --> 04:23:38,440
Ah!

6084
04:23:38,440 --> 04:23:39,400
There it is!

6085
04:23:40,720 --> 04:23:41,200
Huh?

6086
04:23:44,340 --> 04:23:45,840
Colonel, listen to me.

6087
04:23:45,960 --> 04:23:48,100
I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.

6088
04:23:48,220 --> 04:23:48,580
Dun dun!

6089
04:23:49,040 --> 04:23:49,740
A parachute?

6090
04:23:50,260 --> 04:23:52,180
You don't think that Liquid survived?

6091
04:23:53,140 --> 04:23:53,620
Impossible.

6092
04:23:53,900 --> 04:23:58,540
As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion on an infomercial.

6093
04:23:58,760 --> 04:23:58,820
That's true.

6094
04:23:58,820 --> 04:23:59,340
That is true.

6095
04:23:59,500 --> 04:24:01,180
So what's that parachute doing there then?

6096
04:24:01,420 --> 04:24:02,260
I have no idea.

6097
04:24:02,580 --> 04:24:03,400
A trap.

6098
04:24:03,760 --> 04:24:05,680
Either that, or a message.

6099
04:24:05,920 --> 04:24:06,580
To me.

6100
04:24:07,280 --> 04:24:09,360
Meaning I'm not dead, I suppose.

6101
04:24:09,860 --> 04:24:10,280
Scary.

6102
04:24:10,340 --> 04:24:10,560
Maybe.

6103
04:24:10,720 --> 04:24:13,540
But I think it's more like, I'll string you up.

6104
04:24:13,660 --> 04:24:16,720
Well, in any case, don't let your car down.

6105
04:24:16,720 --> 04:24:18,380
Naomi had nothing to say about that.

6106
04:24:18,500 --> 04:24:18,980
I won't.

6107
04:24:20,040 --> 04:24:22,880
Naomi was just like, no comment, Snake.

6108
04:24:23,520 --> 04:24:25,240
Why did you say it like that?

6109
04:24:28,860 --> 04:24:29,940
No comment.

6110
04:24:31,240 --> 04:24:31,780
Okay.

6111
04:24:33,900 --> 04:24:34,440
Nothing

6112
04:24:40,990 --> 04:24:41,310
here.

6113
04:24:41,470 --> 04:24:42,430
Nothing here.

6114
04:24:43,550 --> 04:24:45,150
Is this a fast travel truck?

6115
04:24:46,990 --> 04:24:51,070
Okay, before we go in here, there's the one with the camera room.

6116
04:24:52,130 --> 04:24:53,970
I think this is also a camera room.

6117
04:24:55,690 --> 04:24:56,170
Yep.

6118
04:24:56,630 --> 04:24:57,630
What's in here though?

6119
04:25:02,830 --> 04:25:04,050
What are those?

6120
04:25:05,410 --> 04:25:06,690
I can't tell...

6121
04:25:06,690 --> 04:25:08,850
Oh gosh, I still don't know what type of bullet stuff is.

6122
04:25:17,730 --> 04:25:20,450
Okay, there's like a slight window of opportunity.

6123
04:25:22,870 --> 04:25:23,810
Oh my gosh.

6124
04:25:25,470 --> 04:25:27,010
Don't scare me like that.

6125
04:25:29,190 --> 04:25:30,050
Oh, Nikita.

6126
04:25:30,510 --> 04:25:31,310
Nikita missile.

6127
04:25:31,850 --> 04:25:33,990
Oh, I should probably have mine, just in case.

6128
04:25:37,070 --> 04:25:38,170
It's so quiet.

6129
04:25:40,530 --> 04:25:42,730
Wait, but before it looked out...

6130
04:25:42,730 --> 04:25:44,550
the room, you see that?

6131
04:25:44,870 --> 04:25:46,430
Like... it like...

6132
04:25:46,710 --> 04:25:48,090
had the whole thing open.

6133
04:25:49,630 --> 04:25:50,690
Oh, there we go.

6134
04:25:52,710 --> 04:25:53,330
Oh my gosh.

6135
04:26:09,620 --> 04:26:10,420
We're fine.

6136
04:26:11,620 --> 04:26:12,760
I didn't go in here, right?

6137
04:26:14,860 --> 04:26:15,260
Oh!

6138
04:26:15,320 --> 04:26:16,120
This is where we're supposed to go.

6139
04:26:17,060 --> 04:26:18,600
Then what was this one down here?

6140
04:26:22,040 --> 04:26:23,280
Is this one we...

6141
04:26:23,280 --> 04:26:24,240
can go into?

6142
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:26,620
Rations...

6143
04:26:27,320 --> 04:26:28,040
and... something.

6144
04:26:29,260 --> 04:26:30,060
I'm just gonna chat.

6145
04:26:31,740 --> 04:26:32,440
I give up.

6146
04:26:34,000 --> 04:26:34,700
I give up.

6147
04:26:35,540 --> 04:26:36,360
I give up.

6148
04:26:41,460 --> 04:26:43,560
I don't care what rank I get.

6149
04:26:43,860 --> 04:26:43,980
I don't care what rank I get.

6150
04:26:43,980 --> 04:26:44,160
Oh, wait.

6151
04:26:45,240 --> 04:26:46,200
So, it's okay.

6152
04:26:46,320 --> 04:26:47,400
You don't have to keep commenting.

6153
04:26:47,560 --> 04:26:49,000
She's gonna get blah blah blah rank.

6154
04:26:49,140 --> 04:26:50,040
It's totally fine.

6155
04:26:50,200 --> 04:26:50,860
I don't really care.

6156
04:26:50,860 --> 04:26:52,820
I don't care about stuff like that.

6157
04:26:54,460 --> 04:26:56,060
But thanks for your concern.

6158
04:26:58,020 --> 04:26:58,900
But thanks for your concern.

6159
04:26:59,800 --> 04:27:01,400
We got the next box!

6160
04:27:01,520 --> 04:27:01,960
We got the next box!

6161
04:27:02,100 --> 04:27:03,000
And this one.

6162
04:27:03,500 --> 04:27:04,000
Oh, nope.

6163
04:27:10,400 --> 04:27:10,840
Chaffs!

6164
04:27:11,180 --> 04:27:11,620
Chaff!

6165
04:27:11,700 --> 04:27:12,040
Chaff!

6166
04:27:12,780 --> 04:27:13,220
Grenade!

6167
04:27:13,220 --> 04:27:13,560
Grenade!

6168
04:27:13,560 --> 04:27:13,920
Grenade!

6169
04:27:14,320 --> 04:27:15,300
Okay, we got it all.

6170
04:27:15,580 --> 04:27:16,800
Let's get the heck out of here.

6171
04:27:16,920 --> 04:27:18,060
Okay, now we can go though.

6172
04:27:20,860 --> 04:27:21,000
Beep!

6173
04:27:21,100 --> 04:27:21,440
Beep!

6174
04:27:21,440 --> 04:27:22,860
We care a lot.

6175
04:27:23,700 --> 04:27:26,640
Well, then you can discuss it amongst yourselves.

6176
04:27:27,260 --> 04:27:28,880
Not in my chat!

6177
04:27:30,220 --> 04:27:33,580
Here we go.

6178
04:27:39,740 --> 04:27:40,600
Oh, yeah.

6179
04:27:41,080 --> 04:27:41,800
Chaff.

6180
04:27:42,160 --> 04:27:42,880
Oh.

6181
04:28:03,660 --> 04:28:05,100
Toxic streamer.

6182
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:06,160
Disc 2!

6183
04:28:06,780 --> 04:28:07,140
Oh!

6184
04:28:09,340 --> 04:28:09,480
Wow!

6185
04:28:15,650 --> 04:28:17,650
Press the 3 thingy.

6186
04:28:17,850 --> 04:28:18,350
Oh.

6187
04:28:19,890 --> 04:28:21,090
I'm checking right now.

6188
04:28:25,090 --> 04:28:25,590
Okay.

6189
04:28:27,430 --> 04:28:28,850
That was all Disc 1?

6190
04:28:29,070 --> 04:28:29,350
Yeah.

6191
04:28:29,750 --> 04:28:31,370
But Disc 2 is shorter, you know.

6192
04:28:43,830 --> 04:28:45,430
I wish I could headshot people.

6193
04:28:50,450 --> 04:28:50,950
Okay.

6194
04:28:51,590 --> 04:28:53,250
From here, I gotta go down.

6195
04:28:55,870 --> 04:28:57,770
I wonder if I can knock and get him over.

6196
04:28:59,590 --> 04:28:59,790
Here.

6197
04:29:03,410 --> 04:29:04,790
I wonder if I can choke him.

6198
04:29:05,830 --> 04:29:06,530
Come here.

6199
04:29:06,930 --> 04:29:07,670
Oh my god.

6200
04:29:16,580 --> 04:29:17,380
Oh, thanks.

6201
04:29:18,020 --> 04:29:19,200
I don't need that though.

6202
04:29:20,980 --> 04:29:21,540
Okay.

6203
04:29:22,320 --> 04:29:23,140
I'm gonna...

6204
04:29:23,640 --> 04:29:24,760
I'm gonna save real quick.

6205
04:29:25,940 --> 04:29:26,500
And...

6206
04:29:27,360 --> 04:29:32,080
In China, they say it's better to live ugly than to die beautiful.

6207
04:29:32,080 --> 04:29:33,460
I think it's true.

6208
04:29:33,760 --> 04:29:36,780
Once you're dead, you'll never have another chance to be happy.

6209
04:29:37,240 --> 04:29:40,660
I can't understand people who want to die before their time.

6210
04:29:41,200 --> 04:29:43,700
Please, Snake, promise me that you'll come back alive.

6211
04:29:44,100 --> 04:29:44,240
Aww.

6212
04:29:45,740 --> 04:29:46,780
I promise.

6213
04:29:47,200 --> 04:29:48,800
I promise, you girly.

6214
04:29:53,030 --> 04:29:54,390
Where is the body armor?

6215
04:29:56,130 --> 04:29:56,650
Oh.

6216
04:29:57,130 --> 04:29:57,650
Nothing?

6217
04:29:58,830 --> 04:29:59,350
Yikes.

6218
04:30:00,510 --> 04:30:01,350
Alright, Campbell.

6219
04:30:02,990 --> 04:30:04,390
Snake, that's a blast furnace.

6220
04:30:04,390 --> 04:30:06,210
I'm already dead though, so what am I supposed to do?

6221
04:30:06,510 --> 04:30:07,530
What do they use that for?

6222
04:30:07,830 --> 04:30:10,890
There's no airport on the base, so it's hard to bring in supplies.

6223
04:30:11,370 --> 04:30:15,350
They must have built a blast furnace so they could make building materials and such.

6224
04:30:15,570 --> 04:30:16,490
That makes sense.

6225
04:30:17,950 --> 04:30:19,030
I'm starting to sweat.

6226
04:30:19,290 --> 04:30:20,370
It's getting kind of warm.

6227
04:30:21,050 --> 04:30:23,790
My OG MGS1 disk was damaged by an earthquake.

6228
04:30:23,930 --> 04:30:24,370
Oh no!

6229
04:30:26,330 --> 04:30:27,910
Insurance covered by the replacement?

6230
04:30:28,230 --> 04:30:28,730
That's so awesome.

6231
04:30:28,990 --> 04:30:29,850
Wait, what did he say?

6232
04:30:29,890 --> 04:30:30,490
Tried to find what?

6233
04:30:31,850 --> 04:30:32,670
Uh oh.

6234
04:30:33,590 --> 04:30:38,210
Master, you and I, we're nothing more than dogs, are we?

6235
04:30:38,590 --> 04:30:40,070
That's not like you, Snake.

6236
04:30:40,870 --> 04:30:43,750
Don't let what Sniper Wolf said bother you.

6237
04:30:45,110 --> 04:30:48,770
Listen, there's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself.

6238
04:30:49,130 --> 04:30:52,570
And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.

6239
04:30:52,750 --> 04:31:01,510
But someone like Wolf, a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death, is no good to anyone either.

6240
04:31:02,010 --> 04:31:05,830
Once she started to look for death, it was all over.

6241
04:31:06,610 --> 04:31:08,410
That's how you'll end up too, Snake.

6242
04:31:09,690 --> 04:31:10,130
Whoa.

6243
04:31:13,730 --> 04:31:17,170
There's a cargo elevator in the northeast part of the bottom floor.

6244
04:31:17,170 --> 04:31:17,390
I know!

6245
04:31:17,770 --> 04:31:20,050
You can take that to Metal Gear's underground base.

6246
04:31:20,290 --> 04:31:21,510
You'll spot it right away.

6247
04:31:21,670 --> 04:31:24,250
It's got a big patrol light attached to it.

6248
04:31:24,410 --> 04:31:24,610
Okay!

6249
04:31:25,850 --> 04:31:26,670
Thanks, Otacon!

6250
04:31:27,210 --> 04:31:29,330
Oh, wait, no, that's not what I meant to do, Nastasha.

6251
04:31:29,330 --> 04:31:30,230
What's up, Snake?

6252
04:31:30,790 --> 04:31:32,570
Do not say... Talk to you later, Snake!

6253
04:31:33,090 --> 04:31:33,910
Talk to you later!

6254
04:31:36,770 --> 04:31:40,050
You have a good view, though your movement is limited.

6255
04:31:40,410 --> 04:31:44,350
It might be a good place to take out your enemy with your PSG-1.

6256
04:31:44,990 --> 04:31:46,250
Won't that be too loud?

6257
04:31:47,110 --> 04:31:50,530
Or is it because it's so loud in here that it would be fine to take them out?

6258
04:31:50,670 --> 04:31:51,890
Wait, is she a genius?

6259
04:31:53,790 --> 04:31:54,790
Wait, is she serious?

6260
04:31:55,530 --> 04:31:56,950
Wouldn't it be too loud, though?

6261
04:31:59,970 --> 04:32:00,370
Seriously?

6262
04:32:06,560 --> 04:32:08,120
Where are all the guys, though?

6263
04:32:09,240 --> 04:32:10,480
Okay, there's a camera there.

6264
04:32:10,940 --> 04:32:11,500
Oh my god.

6265
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:12,720
It's like...

6266
04:32:14,400 --> 04:32:15,540
Nastasha, I can't see anything.

6267
04:32:16,100 --> 04:32:16,500
Nastasha.

6268
04:32:16,620 --> 04:32:17,580
Okay, there's two cameras.

6269
04:32:18,120 --> 04:32:20,000
I know there's guys on the other side, though.

6270
04:32:22,180 --> 04:32:23,000
Let's just get out.

6271
04:32:24,180 --> 04:32:24,580
Huh?

6272
04:32:24,640 --> 04:32:25,460
What was that noise?

6273
04:32:26,440 --> 04:32:26,840
Huh?

6274
04:32:27,220 --> 04:32:28,120
What was that noise?

6275
04:32:29,300 --> 04:32:30,940
Can I even see them from here?

6276
04:32:32,800 --> 04:32:33,200
Nastasha?

6277
04:32:33,480 --> 04:32:35,720
I don't know what you're talking about, girl.

6278
04:32:39,240 --> 04:32:40,440
I hope you like my advice.

6279
04:32:40,480 --> 04:32:42,180
After this mission, you'll never hear from me again.

6280
04:32:42,300 --> 04:32:42,700
It's true!

6281
04:32:43,380 --> 04:32:45,160
She writes her book in dips.

6282
04:32:48,240 --> 04:32:48,640
Huh?

6283
04:32:48,800 --> 04:32:49,600
What was that noise?

6284
04:32:50,600 --> 04:32:51,700
Wait, maybe from over here.

6285
04:32:53,820 --> 04:32:54,620
Maybe from here.

6286
04:33:00,810 --> 04:33:02,010
Nastasha, girl, what?

6287
04:33:02,490 --> 04:33:04,270
Are we playing the same game?

6288
04:33:07,010 --> 04:33:10,810
Where do you want me to shoot these guys from?

6289
04:33:13,810 --> 04:33:14,410
What?

6290
04:33:15,930 --> 04:33:17,930
I'm eating floor right now.

6291
04:33:17,930 --> 04:33:18,790
Nastasha, please.

6292
04:33:19,750 --> 04:33:20,910
Okay, whatever.

6293
04:33:22,390 --> 04:33:23,890
I thought she was cooking.

6294
04:33:24,130 --> 04:33:25,130
I really thought.

6295
04:33:27,010 --> 04:33:27,610
Okay.

6296
04:33:28,230 --> 04:33:29,890
This guy right here.

6297
04:33:30,430 --> 04:33:31,670
Where are they anyway?

6298
04:33:32,090 --> 04:33:33,930
I don't even see the other guys here.

6299
04:33:34,110 --> 04:33:36,050
Actually, now that I think about it.

6300
04:33:36,070 --> 04:33:38,590
There's a guy walking around over there, isn't there?

6301
04:33:39,270 --> 04:33:40,330
Look at the little rats.

6302
04:33:42,450 --> 04:33:44,630
Does she mean the cameras?

6303
04:33:48,010 --> 04:33:50,810
Everyone's allowed to give a little bad advice as a treat.

6304
04:33:53,730 --> 04:33:55,570
Okay, I'm nervous about this one.

6305
04:33:55,670 --> 04:33:56,610
Oh, there he is!

6306
04:33:56,650 --> 04:33:57,110
There he is!

6307
04:34:01,610 --> 04:34:03,510
I thought there were three guys, though.

6308
04:34:12,050 --> 04:34:17,290
Okay, I'm nervous about this because, you know, sometimes the wall and I don't really get along.

6309
04:34:17,490 --> 04:34:17,970
Oh, God.

6310
04:34:18,050 --> 04:34:18,310
Oh, God.

6311
04:34:18,330 --> 04:34:18,610
Oh, God.

6312
04:34:19,310 --> 04:34:21,290
Sometimes the wall and I don't really get along.

6313
04:34:22,830 --> 04:34:23,410
Oh, my God.

6314
04:34:23,450 --> 04:34:23,910
There he is.

6315
04:34:26,190 --> 04:34:28,330
He doesn't show up on my radar, which is...

6316
04:34:28,330 --> 04:34:28,850
Oh, yes, he does.

6317
04:34:28,910 --> 04:34:29,210
Just kidding.

6318
04:34:34,540 --> 04:34:35,660
Is this where I should...

6319
04:34:35,660 --> 04:34:35,920
Yes.

6320
04:34:43,020 --> 04:34:43,380
Yippee!

6321
04:34:44,680 --> 04:34:45,900
Maybe I can do it from here.

6322
04:34:46,620 --> 04:34:49,720
I just want to know what her thought process is, truly.

6323
04:34:51,900 --> 04:34:53,620
Maybe from here I can do it.

6324
04:34:55,560 --> 04:34:56,080
Nastasha!

6325
04:34:59,200 --> 04:35:00,960
Nastasha, there's no way!

6326
04:35:02,300 --> 04:35:02,820
Nastasha!

6327
04:35:03,500 --> 04:35:04,420
From the staircase?

6328
04:35:20,580 --> 04:35:21,100
Sorry.

6329
04:35:21,240 --> 04:35:22,300
I know I keep trying this.

6330
04:35:22,380 --> 04:35:22,840
I'm just...

6331
04:35:22,840 --> 04:35:24,760
I can't even... I can't even...

6332
04:35:24,760 --> 04:35:25,820
I can't even reach him.

6333
04:35:35,340 --> 04:35:35,920
Oh, my God.

6334
04:35:38,800 --> 04:35:40,240
He doesn't come up the stairs, does he?

6335
04:35:40,620 --> 04:35:41,780
Does he even look up the stairs?

6336
04:36:03,590 --> 04:36:04,950
I don't know where he... Oh, there he is.

6337
04:36:09,210 --> 04:36:10,910
I need to be on the stairs.

6338
04:36:11,270 --> 04:36:12,050
He's gonna see me, though.

6339
04:36:12,630 --> 04:36:13,950
He's gonna see me in my box.

6340
04:36:15,330 --> 04:36:17,290
He's about to see me in my box.

6341
04:36:17,890 --> 04:36:18,730
He's gonna go, huh?

6342
04:36:18,850 --> 04:36:19,530
Just a box.

6343
04:36:21,850 --> 04:36:22,190
See?

6344
04:36:24,690 --> 04:36:25,510
Just a box.

6345
04:36:28,850 --> 04:36:29,750
Just a box.

6346
04:36:31,450 --> 04:36:31,850
Oh,

6347
04:36:43,990 --> 04:36:44,130
God.

6348
04:36:44,310 --> 04:36:44,990
Don't see me.

6349
04:36:45,750 --> 04:36:46,590
Don't come this way.

6350
04:36:48,830 --> 04:36:49,230
C4.

6351
04:36:51,010 --> 04:36:53,250
If he comes this way, we're taking him out.

6352
04:36:53,970 --> 04:36:54,890
Is he okay?

6353
04:36:54,970 --> 04:36:55,770
What is he doing?

6354
04:36:58,930 --> 04:36:59,970
Are you okay, buddy?

6355
04:37:00,370 --> 04:37:01,950
Did you get a little spooked by something?

6356
04:37:03,390 --> 04:37:06,270
We have to go inside this elevator to...

6357
04:37:08,030 --> 04:37:08,770
Sorry, hold on.

6358
04:37:08,790 --> 04:37:09,450
I'm just getting my bearings.

6359
04:37:09,970 --> 04:37:11,730
To... for later.

6360
04:37:11,890 --> 04:37:12,550
I believe.

6361
04:37:13,250 --> 04:37:14,990
Is he good?

6362
04:37:15,230 --> 04:37:16,190
What is happening?

6363
04:37:19,130 --> 04:37:20,650
What's wrong with you?

6364
04:37:22,430 --> 04:37:23,410
Oh, shit.

6365
04:37:23,670 --> 04:37:24,530
Oh, shit.

6366
04:37:24,670 --> 04:37:26,170
I was gonna go for it.

6367
04:37:26,210 --> 04:37:26,650
But he...

6368
04:37:26,650 --> 04:37:28,090
He came back.

6369
04:37:28,690 --> 04:37:29,910
Don't come this way.

6370
04:37:32,050 --> 04:37:34,090
What is he doing?

6371
04:37:34,090 --> 04:37:34,130
What is he doing?

6372
04:37:45,320 --> 04:37:47,300
We'll just leave him to his devices.

6373
04:37:47,860 --> 04:37:48,940
He's got demons.

6374
04:37:49,220 --> 04:37:52,060
He's dealing with something, you guys.

6375
04:37:52,160 --> 04:37:53,460
I don't know what to tell you.

6376
04:37:54,480 --> 04:37:56,360
He's going through it a little bit.

6377
04:37:56,480 --> 04:37:56,780
Or something.

6378
04:38:00,760 --> 04:38:02,460
Here comes the elevator.

6379
04:38:04,540 --> 04:38:05,720
Here it comes.

6380
04:38:06,040 --> 04:38:06,680
Here it comes.

6381
04:38:06,740 --> 04:38:07,220
Here it comes.

6382
04:38:07,220 --> 04:38:08,420
They're giving me lots of bullets.

6383
04:38:09,060 --> 04:38:11,800
I sure hope that this elevator will be...

6384
04:38:12,420 --> 04:38:13,200
I sure hope that this elevator will be...

6385
04:38:13,200 --> 04:38:15,180
a calm, nice, collected little ride.

6386
04:38:15,300 --> 04:38:16,440
a calm, nice, collected little ride.

6387
04:38:16,440 --> 04:38:19,720
Surely this one will be the calm elevator ride.

6388
04:38:19,980 --> 04:38:20,100
Surely this one will be the calm elevator ride.

6389
04:38:20,320 --> 04:38:21,580
Oh, the body armor!

6390
04:38:22,660 --> 04:38:24,120
Should I get it now or later?

6391
04:38:27,790 --> 04:38:28,910
Where is it at?

6392
04:38:29,410 --> 04:38:30,750
Because I have to come back here.

6393
04:38:33,810 --> 04:38:34,830
I think I could...

6394
04:38:34,830 --> 04:38:36,870
Well, I'll want it before...

6395
04:38:37,950 --> 04:38:38,650
Vulcan Raven.

6396
04:38:39,490 --> 04:38:39,950
Probably.

6397
04:38:45,980 --> 04:38:47,100
You can get it now.

6398
04:38:47,240 --> 04:38:47,700
Get it now.

6399
04:38:54,120 --> 04:38:55,040
Where is it at?

6400
04:38:55,160 --> 04:38:56,640
Can you guys backseat for me?

6401
04:39:13,480 --> 04:39:13,940
Huh?

6402
04:39:36,090 --> 04:39:36,910
Got a vent?

6403
04:39:37,090 --> 04:39:38,030
Inside that vent.

6404
04:39:38,570 --> 04:39:39,190
That's a vent.

6405
04:39:39,790 --> 04:39:40,330
There's a vent.

6406
04:39:40,350 --> 04:39:40,570
Is there a vent here?

6407
04:39:42,270 --> 04:39:43,110
Am I crazy?

6408
04:39:43,690 --> 04:39:44,950
There's no vent in this.

6409
04:39:46,470 --> 04:39:47,230
Oh my goodness.

6410
04:39:47,390 --> 04:39:47,930
In here?

6411
04:39:48,570 --> 04:39:48,950
Oh.

6412
04:39:53,980 --> 04:39:54,500
Ouch!

6413
04:39:54,700 --> 04:39:55,500
I forgot.

6414
04:39:58,240 --> 04:39:59,320
Is that it?

6415
04:40:02,540 --> 04:40:04,120
I believe they mean the door.

6416
04:40:04,440 --> 04:40:06,720
Yeah, this is not really a vent, you guys.

6417
04:40:08,160 --> 04:40:08,680
PSG.

6418
04:40:11,440 --> 04:40:13,020
Unless there's a vent inside here.

6419
04:40:13,660 --> 04:40:14,560
Is that it?

6420
04:40:14,720 --> 04:40:16,240
That looks like more bullets.

6421
04:40:17,900 --> 04:40:18,360
In

6422
04:40:26,540 --> 04:40:26,820
here?

6423
04:40:26,960 --> 04:40:27,300
Somewhere.

6424
04:40:28,440 --> 04:40:30,020
Somewhere around here, perhaps?

6425
04:40:32,360 --> 04:40:32,820
Ouch!

6426
04:40:32,840 --> 04:40:33,080
Ouch!

6427
04:40:33,120 --> 04:40:33,340
Ouch!

6428
04:40:33,340 --> 04:40:33,480
Ouch!

6429
04:40:35,400 --> 04:40:35,860
Oh?

6430
04:40:40,170 --> 04:40:41,530
There's stuff to crawl under?

6431
04:40:41,690 --> 04:40:42,270
Okay, hold on.

6432
04:40:42,310 --> 04:40:42,770
I'll go back.

6433
04:40:51,230 --> 04:40:52,150
Wait, under...

6434
04:40:55,090 --> 04:40:57,010
There's a marked entrance on the radar.

6435
04:40:57,510 --> 04:40:58,550
When he came in.

6436
04:40:59,450 --> 04:41:01,790
Crawl under the pipes on the left side of the room.

6437
04:41:01,790 --> 04:41:03,030
Okay, thanks, mod!

6438
04:41:03,570 --> 04:41:04,170
Ouch!

6439
04:41:05,610 --> 04:41:06,210
Okay.

6440
04:41:09,350 --> 04:41:09,950
Wait.

6441
04:41:11,390 --> 04:41:14,250
Crawl under the pipes on the left side of the room.

6442
04:41:18,360 --> 04:41:20,000
Not the ghost ration, right?

6443
04:41:24,310 --> 04:41:25,070
Stun grenade.

6444
04:41:25,310 --> 04:41:25,810
Take that.

6445
04:41:26,950 --> 04:41:27,550
Wait.

6446
04:41:27,670 --> 04:41:27,790
Oh!

6447
04:41:29,010 --> 04:41:29,610
Oh!

6448
04:41:29,950 --> 04:41:31,230
Okay, inside here.

6449
04:41:34,190 --> 04:41:34,510
Oh!

6450
04:41:34,770 --> 04:41:35,490
I see it!

6451
04:41:35,530 --> 04:41:35,830
I see it!

6452
04:41:35,890 --> 04:41:36,550
I see it!

6453
04:41:38,290 --> 04:41:39,070
Oh, my God.

6454
04:41:39,290 --> 04:41:41,510
Sorry, I'm a little slow.

6455
04:41:42,110 --> 04:41:42,430
Again.

6456
04:41:43,530 --> 04:41:44,050
There we go.

6457
04:41:44,430 --> 04:41:44,750
Here!

6458
04:41:47,550 --> 04:41:48,150
I see it.

6459
04:41:48,250 --> 04:41:48,370
I see it.

6460
04:41:53,670 --> 04:41:53,990
Oh...

6461
04:41:54,770 --> 04:41:55,090
Okay,

6462
04:42:09,150 --> 04:42:09,450
hold on.

6463
04:42:09,510 --> 04:42:11,250
I gotta scoot out a little bit to stand up.

6464
04:42:11,610 --> 04:42:11,930
And...

6465
04:42:11,930 --> 04:42:12,690
Thrill.

6466
04:42:17,790 --> 04:42:18,750
Bunny armor!

6467
04:42:19,410 --> 04:42:20,770
Anything else around here?

6468
04:42:21,670 --> 04:42:23,230
Ooh, that's a stove, actually.

6469
04:42:23,490 --> 04:42:24,690
More chopper in it, I'll take it.

6470
04:42:25,710 --> 04:42:26,190
Okay.

6471
04:42:26,810 --> 04:42:27,390
Beep beep!

6472
04:42:29,490 --> 04:42:30,110
There we go.

6473
04:42:31,250 --> 04:42:31,730
Nice.

6474
04:42:31,910 --> 04:42:32,690
Okay, thanks guys!

6475
04:42:33,650 --> 04:42:34,130
Sorry.

6476
04:42:34,130 --> 04:42:35,090
A little slow.

6477
04:42:35,750 --> 04:42:36,190
Oh!

6478
04:42:36,210 --> 04:42:36,810
How did I?

6479
04:42:36,930 --> 04:42:37,330
How did I?

6480
04:42:37,470 --> 04:42:38,070
How did I?

6481
04:42:38,130 --> 04:42:39,050
Oh my god!

6482
04:42:39,130 --> 04:42:40,070
It's always this one!

6483
04:42:41,370 --> 04:42:45,370
It's faster than I anticipate it being, which is why it gets me every time.

6484
04:42:45,910 --> 04:42:46,750
But we're fine.

6485
04:42:47,150 --> 04:42:47,770
We're okay.

6486
04:42:48,190 --> 04:42:48,990
We're heading back.

6487
04:42:49,490 --> 04:42:50,050
We're leaving.

6488
04:42:50,410 --> 04:42:51,770
We don't care about those guys.

6489
04:42:54,190 --> 04:42:54,590
Okay.

6490
04:42:56,470 --> 04:42:57,230
Thank you guys.

6491
04:42:57,370 --> 04:42:57,890
Thank you, thank you.

6492
04:43:00,090 --> 04:43:00,890
Okey dokey!

6493
04:43:01,170 --> 04:43:02,270
What else is around here?

6494
04:43:02,310 --> 04:43:02,830
Anything else?

6495
04:43:04,730 --> 04:43:05,590
Don't think so.

6496
04:43:05,910 --> 04:43:06,310
Oh!

6497
04:43:06,390 --> 04:43:06,990
Just kidding.

6498
04:43:07,130 --> 04:43:07,930
Can I fall here?

6499
04:43:08,190 --> 04:43:09,250
Can I fall and die?

6500
04:43:10,070 --> 04:43:12,110
That would really be unfortunate, wouldn't it?

6501
04:43:14,830 --> 04:43:16,110
No more SOCOM.

6502
04:43:18,130 --> 04:43:18,730
SOCOM.

6503
04:43:18,730 --> 04:43:19,330
SOCOM.

6504
04:43:20,810 --> 04:43:22,430
Get outta here, orb!

6505
04:43:24,450 --> 04:43:26,890
Actually, thanks for being here and doing your job.

6506
04:43:27,270 --> 04:43:29,370
That I totally pay you.

6507
04:43:29,630 --> 04:43:30,470
To do.

6508
04:43:35,910 --> 04:43:37,110
Okey dokey!

6509
04:43:37,870 --> 04:43:38,350
Let's go.

6510
04:43:41,210 --> 04:43:41,670
Beep!

6511
04:43:44,690 --> 04:43:45,370
Beep, beep, beep.

6512
04:43:45,790 --> 04:43:46,250
Beep.

6513
04:43:46,890 --> 04:43:48,090
Maybe a card?

6514
04:43:48,930 --> 04:43:49,770
Card six.

6515
04:43:50,490 --> 04:43:51,090
There we go.

6516
04:44:02,000 --> 04:44:02,760
Oh my god!

6517
04:44:02,820 --> 04:44:03,000
No!

6518
04:44:03,060 --> 04:44:05,240
This was supposed to be a peaceful elevator ride!

6519
04:44:06,960 --> 04:44:07,420
No!

6520
04:44:16,860 --> 04:44:18,380
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

6521
04:44:19,120 --> 04:44:20,760
Actually, um, actually...

6522
04:44:30,660 --> 04:44:31,260
I'm sorry.

6523
04:44:31,340 --> 04:44:32,540
How did you live my choke?

6524
04:44:33,120 --> 04:44:34,500
How did you live my choke?

6525
04:44:35,200 --> 04:44:36,720
How did you live...

6526
04:44:36,720 --> 04:44:37,560
How did you...

6527
04:44:37,560 --> 04:44:38,620
How did you survive?

6528
04:44:39,640 --> 04:44:40,080
Scripted!

6529
04:44:40,420 --> 04:44:41,600
It's so scripted!

6530
04:44:42,720 --> 04:44:43,340
Oh my god.

6531
04:44:43,540 --> 04:44:44,120
Ouchie ouch.

6532
04:44:54,450 --> 04:44:54,890
Please.

6533
04:44:55,830 --> 04:44:56,890
Please let me get up.

6534
04:44:57,770 --> 04:45:00,050
Oh my god.

6535
04:45:00,090 --> 04:45:01,170
I'm trying to shoot it!

6536
04:45:01,830 --> 04:45:03,010
I'm just holding down.

6537
04:45:06,550 --> 04:45:08,370
This is... This is ridiculous.

6538
04:45:10,310 --> 04:45:11,790
This is ridiculousness.

6539
04:45:13,310 --> 04:45:13,650
Oh!

6540
04:45:15,730 --> 04:45:17,150
They live... They die.

6541
04:45:17,270 --> 04:45:17,630
I live.

6542
04:45:18,310 --> 04:45:19,930
Skill issue something something.

6543
04:45:36,200 --> 04:45:37,480
I hear them.

6544
04:45:38,060 --> 04:45:38,360
Ah!

6545
04:45:45,000 --> 04:45:46,540
Aren't there also...

6546
04:45:47,380 --> 04:45:47,860
Um...

6547
04:45:47,860 --> 04:45:49,040
Oh, wait.

6548
04:45:49,120 --> 04:45:50,560
It won't let me use the mine detector.

6549
04:45:51,520 --> 04:45:53,240
But aren't there also mines in there?

6550
04:45:55,880 --> 04:45:56,680
I think so.

6551
04:45:58,840 --> 04:45:59,320
Oi!

6552
04:46:08,110 --> 04:46:09,090
Just avoid them.

6553
04:46:11,310 --> 04:46:12,710
Just avoid them.

6554
04:46:13,370 --> 04:46:14,650
Um... um... card.

6555
04:46:15,850 --> 04:46:16,250
Beep!

6556
04:46:32,570 --> 04:46:34,070
Okay, this is the calm one.

6557
04:46:38,630 --> 04:46:40,570
Unless... I wanna have a little fun.

6558
04:46:41,930 --> 04:46:43,810
Unless I'm a little bit of a freak.

6559
04:46:43,990 --> 04:46:44,950
Actually, I can't see anything.

6560
04:46:45,290 --> 04:46:46,330
Can I even snipe them?

6561
04:46:46,470 --> 04:46:46,830
You know what?

6562
04:46:47,870 --> 04:46:48,470
It's fine.

6563
04:46:49,170 --> 04:46:50,270
It's probably for the best.

6564
04:46:52,630 --> 04:46:53,750
Brr... brr...

6565
04:46:54,270 --> 04:46:57,910
Brr... brr... brr... brr... brr... bird... bird...

6566
04:47:00,190 --> 04:47:01,810
I punched the bird!

6567
04:47:02,170 --> 04:47:03,890
I punched the bird, you guys!

6568
04:47:04,070 --> 04:47:04,530
Oh.

6569
04:47:04,810 --> 04:47:05,370
Yeah?

6570
04:47:06,890 --> 04:47:08,030
Sorry, Master Miller.

6571
04:47:08,130 --> 04:47:08,910
I punched a bird.

6572
04:47:09,990 --> 04:47:10,550
Oh.

6573
04:47:10,590 --> 04:47:11,110
Okay.

6574
04:47:11,170 --> 04:47:11,970
Not about the bird.

6575
04:47:14,310 --> 04:47:14,870
Yes.

6576
04:47:16,110 --> 04:47:16,670
Okay.

6577
04:47:20,810 --> 04:47:21,290
Yeah?

6578
04:47:23,510 --> 04:47:24,930
Why are you so rude to your master?

6579
04:47:26,590 --> 04:47:32,030
What are you saying?

6580
04:47:36,270 --> 04:47:37,010
Yeah, yeah.

6581
04:47:37,130 --> 04:47:38,230
Yeah, yeah.

6582
04:47:38,550 --> 04:47:38,870
What?

6583
04:47:57,590 --> 04:47:58,990
Oh!

6584
04:48:01,450 --> 04:48:02,850
Oh!

6585
04:48:06,010 --> 04:48:07,490
Why would he have...

6586
04:48:07,490 --> 04:48:10,110
Oh!

6587
04:48:15,450 --> 04:48:15,650
Oh!

6588
04:48:15,650 --> 04:48:17,950
They first started in 1960.

6589
04:48:18,430 --> 04:48:19,250
In Chicago.

6590
04:48:19,830 --> 04:48:21,030
Not New York.

6591
04:48:21,150 --> 04:48:21,970
Dun dun dun!

6592
04:48:22,570 --> 04:48:24,090
You better check it out.

6593
04:48:24,250 --> 04:48:26,930
The chief and the president mysteriously dying.

6594
04:48:27,090 --> 04:48:28,010
And that ninja.

6595
04:48:28,210 --> 04:48:30,210
Too many strange things are happening.

6596
04:48:30,210 --> 04:48:31,910
There are a lot of strange things happening.

6597
04:48:31,910 --> 04:48:34,110
Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?

6598
04:48:34,410 --> 04:48:35,470
I don't know.

6599
04:48:35,890 --> 04:48:39,250
Either that, or she's working with the terrorists.

6600
04:48:39,930 --> 04:48:40,930
Could it be?

6601
04:48:41,450 --> 04:48:43,950
If I find out anything, I'll call.

6602
04:48:44,290 --> 04:48:46,970
In the meantime, be careful.

6603
04:48:47,290 --> 04:48:48,310
Master, I'm scared.

6604
04:48:48,690 --> 04:48:49,690
I can't trust anybody.

6605
04:48:50,090 --> 04:48:51,010
Wait, let's, uh...

6606
04:48:51,010 --> 04:48:51,350
Oh.

6607
04:48:51,410 --> 04:48:52,630
Oh, I wanted to punch that bird.

6608
04:48:52,870 --> 04:48:53,410
Dang it.

6609
04:48:54,970 --> 04:48:56,490
Ooh, it's chilly here.

6610
04:48:56,730 --> 04:48:57,590
It's really blue.

6611
04:49:08,370 --> 04:49:08,970
Campbell?

6612
04:49:10,650 --> 04:49:12,210
Colonel, where's Naomi?

6613
04:49:12,570 --> 04:49:13,490
I'm right here, Snake.

6614
04:49:13,710 --> 04:49:14,370
What is it?

6615
04:49:14,510 --> 04:49:15,230
Oh, nothing.

6616
04:49:15,570 --> 04:49:16,970
I wasn't asking.

6617
04:49:17,110 --> 04:49:19,910
I wasn't... I wasn't asking for it.

6618
04:49:19,910 --> 04:49:22,350
By now, those terrorists have finished their launch preparations.

6619
04:49:22,670 --> 04:49:24,130
Stop wasting time.

6620
04:49:24,770 --> 04:49:27,070
Metal Gear's base is up ahead.

6621
04:49:27,530 --> 04:49:30,130
Snake, it's over 30 below outside.

6622
04:49:31,710 --> 04:49:32,190
What's wrong?

6623
04:49:32,750 --> 04:49:33,230
Nothing.

6624
04:49:33,730 --> 04:49:34,310
Snake,

6625
04:49:37,630 --> 04:49:38,550
don't be so obvious.

6626
04:49:38,810 --> 04:49:39,630
Snake, come on.

6627
04:49:39,950 --> 04:49:42,030
Stop lollygagging around.

6628
04:49:42,510 --> 04:49:45,910
Snake, stop being so obvious.

6629
04:49:47,250 --> 04:49:48,550
Master Miller, I'm scared.

6630
04:49:49,030 --> 04:49:50,570
I want to ask you about Naomi.

6631
04:49:50,870 --> 04:49:51,010
Yeah.

6632
04:49:51,270 --> 04:49:52,970
I'm looking into the details now.

6633
04:49:53,150 --> 04:49:54,550
But it doesn't look good.

6634
04:49:54,950 --> 04:49:57,450
Weren't you ever suspicious about her, Snake?

6635
04:49:57,690 --> 04:49:57,710
A lot.

6636
04:49:57,710 --> 04:49:58,610
I was a lot, yeah.

6637
04:49:58,950 --> 04:50:01,430
Snake, keep your guard up.

6638
04:50:02,810 --> 04:50:03,330
Master!

6639
04:50:03,670 --> 04:50:05,330
Master, you're the only one I can trust!

6640
04:50:10,490 --> 04:50:13,390
What the hell are all these crows doing around here?

6641
04:50:14,390 --> 04:50:14,910
Crows?

6642
04:50:15,910 --> 04:50:16,330
You got me?

6643
04:50:17,090 --> 04:50:19,070
There were crows around from before.

6644
04:50:19,490 --> 04:50:25,130
But for some reason, they started to really increase in number around the same time that Foxhound came to the base.

6645
04:50:25,230 --> 04:50:25,590
Creepy.

6646
04:50:25,810 --> 04:50:26,630
It's really weird.

6647
04:50:26,890 --> 04:50:28,130
I wonder what it could mean.

6648
04:50:28,910 --> 04:50:30,690
Did that just say rally weird?

6649
04:50:31,190 --> 04:50:33,830
Did I... Did I...

6650
04:50:35,050 --> 04:50:36,530
It's rally weird.

6651
04:50:42,070 --> 04:50:43,730
Stasha, bring us off topic.

6652
04:50:43,730 --> 04:50:51,390
As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.

6653
04:50:51,870 --> 04:50:56,530
If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination.

6654
04:50:56,570 --> 04:51:01,110
There she goes.

6655
04:51:01,510 --> 04:51:08,670
I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.

6656
04:51:08,950 --> 04:51:11,330
Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.

6657
04:51:11,330 --> 04:51:12,570
Rally weird.

6658
04:51:13,010 --> 04:51:15,970
The victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see.

6659
04:51:16,130 --> 04:51:18,270
And I have seen a lot of it.

6660
04:51:18,370 --> 04:51:20,290
This is such a serious topic, too.

6661
04:51:20,450 --> 04:51:21,150
I have seen more than enough of it.

6662
04:51:22,610 --> 04:51:23,790
What do you mean?

6663
04:51:23,850 --> 04:51:26,250
I was born and raised in Pripyat, Ukraine.

6664
04:51:26,830 --> 04:51:29,750
I was ten years old on that day.

6665
04:51:30,010 --> 04:51:32,330
April 26, 1986.

6666
04:51:33,150 --> 04:51:34,590
You don't mean...

6667
04:51:34,590 --> 04:51:35,330
Yes.

6668
04:51:35,850 --> 04:51:36,450
Chernobyl.

6669
04:51:36,650 --> 04:51:37,130
Chernobyl.

6670
04:51:37,410 --> 04:51:40,630
That is the day that changed my life Didn't we watch this one?

6671
04:51:40,810 --> 04:51:40,850
Or...

6672
04:51:41,330 --> 04:51:42,710
I feel like we listened to this one.

6673
04:51:42,830 --> 04:51:44,770
I live just three kilometers north of there.

6674
04:51:46,510 --> 04:51:50,770
600,000 to 700,000 people were evacuated.

6675
04:51:51,030 --> 04:51:56,390
Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.

6676
04:51:57,070 --> 04:52:03,370
Between 1986 and 1993 12,000 children died.

6677
04:52:03,690 --> 04:52:04,250
Oh my god.

6678
04:52:04,570 --> 04:52:10,870
My parents and many others like them who helped in the cleanup died a few years later.

6679
04:52:11,330 --> 04:52:12,370
From radiation sickness.

6680
04:52:13,210 --> 04:52:18,090
We must read this world of all nuclear weapons.

6681
04:52:18,990 --> 04:52:20,370
Before they cause more...

6682
04:52:20,370 --> 04:52:22,950
This is a good chance to get into the stalker series.

6683
04:52:23,390 --> 04:52:25,870
Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.

6684
04:52:27,090 --> 04:52:32,850
I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.

6685
04:52:33,690 --> 04:52:35,770
Wow, she sounded so serious there.

6686
04:52:36,190 --> 04:52:36,950
Mei Ling.

6687
04:52:38,210 --> 04:52:39,110
Mei Ling.

6688
04:52:39,310 --> 04:52:40,130
How's Naomi?

6689
04:52:40,470 --> 04:52:40,670
Huh?

6690
04:52:40,670 --> 04:52:41,310
It wasn't about nuclear weapons.

6691
04:52:41,330 --> 04:52:42,330
She's fine, I guess.

6692
04:52:42,410 --> 04:52:43,110
I think it's just...

6693
04:52:43,910 --> 04:52:44,710
nuclear technology.

6694
04:52:44,710 --> 04:52:45,410
What do you want, Snake?

6695
04:52:45,570 --> 04:52:47,530
If you want to talk to Naomi, why don't you call her?

6696
04:52:47,830 --> 04:52:48,510
Oh no, it's fine.

6697
04:52:49,330 --> 04:52:50,190
Don't worry about it.

6698
04:52:51,290 --> 04:52:52,990
Why is everybody calling me strange?

6699
04:53:02,090 --> 04:53:03,150
Good luck, Snake.

6700
04:53:03,750 --> 04:53:04,350
Thank you.

6701
04:53:06,030 --> 04:53:06,430
Alrighty.

6702
04:53:07,350 --> 04:53:08,770
We got all these crows.

6703
04:53:10,630 --> 04:53:11,430
We got...

6704
04:53:12,710 --> 04:53:13,910
all of this...

6705
04:53:14,830 --> 04:53:15,230
stuff.

6706
04:53:16,350 --> 04:53:17,930
Oh, giving me the C4, eh?

6707
04:53:18,030 --> 04:53:19,130
And the Nikita missiles.

6708
04:53:19,270 --> 04:53:19,990
Look at my life.

6709
04:53:21,110 --> 04:53:22,830
I only have two out of...

6710
04:53:22,830 --> 04:53:23,990
I only...

6711
04:53:23,990 --> 04:53:25,110
Oh, now I have three rations.

6712
04:53:25,510 --> 04:53:28,030
Three rations against Vulcan Raven?

6713
04:53:28,370 --> 04:53:29,150
With my...

6714
04:53:29,150 --> 04:53:33,010
Really, it's gonna feel like only two rations against Vulcan Raven.

6715
04:53:37,830 --> 04:53:38,350
Um...

6716
04:53:38,990 --> 04:53:41,930
I guess we'll see how we do next week.

6717
04:53:42,790 --> 04:53:43,310
Probably.

6718
04:53:43,970 --> 04:53:44,770
I think.

6719
04:53:46,350 --> 04:53:46,690
Boss fight?

6720
04:53:46,930 --> 04:53:47,890
We have a boss fight?

6721
04:53:48,750 --> 04:53:49,850
The next...

6722
04:53:51,390 --> 04:53:51,950
Actually...

6723
04:53:51,950 --> 04:53:52,570
Um...

6724
04:53:55,310 --> 04:53:56,330
Let's see...

6725
04:53:56,330 --> 04:53:57,270
Um...

6726
04:53:59,050 --> 04:54:00,090
We have...

6727
04:54:00,090 --> 04:54:01,730
Vulcan Raven...

6728
04:54:02,790 --> 04:54:03,910
We have...

6729
04:54:05,610 --> 04:54:07,050
I figured if I...

6730
04:54:07,050 --> 04:54:09,290
I initially was going to Endurance this.

6731
04:54:09,550 --> 04:54:12,010
I think if I Endurance'd it, I think I would've finished.

6732
04:54:12,550 --> 04:54:15,690
Because all I have is Vulcan Raven, and then...

6733
04:54:16,770 --> 04:54:17,770
and then...

6734
04:54:17,770 --> 04:54:20,050
the keys, and then...

6735
04:54:20,050 --> 04:54:20,710
Rex!

6736
04:54:21,470 --> 04:54:23,470
And the ending sequence.

6737
04:54:23,890 --> 04:54:29,530
So I think I would've actually been able to beat it if I had actually followed through with, um...

6738
04:54:30,250 --> 04:54:30,790
Endurancing it.

6739
04:54:32,070 --> 04:54:33,330
But I think...

6740
04:54:33,330 --> 04:54:34,150
Um...

6741
04:54:35,290 --> 04:54:37,130
Yeah, if I went for a few more hours...

6742
04:54:37,130 --> 04:54:37,770
Yeah, I think so.

6743
04:54:38,430 --> 04:54:40,490
But I think I'm gonna stop it here.

6744
04:54:40,650 --> 04:54:42,530
And then we'll just finish up next week.

6745
04:54:43,170 --> 04:54:44,290
Before I...

6746
04:54:47,250 --> 04:54:47,930
California!

6747
04:54:50,130 --> 04:54:52,330
So, I've been breaking her own spoiler rules.

6748
04:54:52,470 --> 04:54:52,910
Hey, hey!

6749
04:54:53,090 --> 04:54:55,310
I mean, lore spoilers, okay?

6750
04:54:55,470 --> 04:54:58,330
Not game... I've already played the Twin Snakes.

6751
04:54:58,530 --> 04:54:59,990
And so...

6752
04:54:59,990 --> 04:55:01,830
It's the same, okay?

6753
04:55:03,510 --> 04:55:04,210
But yeah!

6754
04:55:04,950 --> 04:55:06,690
Thank you always!

6755
04:55:07,130 --> 04:55:08,090
Here you are!

6756
04:55:10,750 --> 04:55:11,830
Thanks for the stream!

6757
04:55:11,910 --> 04:55:12,490
Thank you guys!

6758
04:55:12,490 --> 04:55:14,290
Yeah, actually I have some...

6759
04:55:14,290 --> 04:55:16,970
I have actually quite a bit of stuff I need to take care of.

6760
04:55:17,130 --> 04:55:18,590
Um, I have a lot of recording.

6761
04:55:18,750 --> 04:55:20,570
We have to record the podcast since...

6762
04:55:20,570 --> 04:55:26,390
Matara forgot about a collab she had this morning even though I woke up on time to...

6763
04:55:26,390 --> 04:55:27,230
to record.

6764
04:55:27,710 --> 04:55:29,190
But she completely forgot.

6765
04:55:29,830 --> 04:55:31,670
And so we couldn't record this morning!

6766
04:55:33,090 --> 04:55:34,570
André goes thanks for the 10 gifted!

6767
04:55:37,750 --> 04:55:38,190
And...

6768
04:55:39,170 --> 04:55:39,610
Um...

6769
04:55:40,350 --> 04:55:42,470
So, yeah, right after this I'm doing...

6770
04:55:42,490 --> 04:55:43,190
more talking.

6771
04:55:44,690 --> 04:55:48,510
And, uh... I have some other stuff I gotta do to prepare for next week.

6772
04:55:48,570 --> 04:55:49,710
And... stuff.

6773
04:55:49,850 --> 04:55:50,230
So...

6774
04:55:50,230 --> 04:55:51,990
Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

6775
04:55:52,690 --> 04:55:54,150
Thank you for the stream!

6776
04:55:54,570 --> 04:55:55,350
You're welcome!

6777
04:55:57,050 --> 04:55:58,730
And then next week...

6778
04:55:58,730 --> 04:56:00,850
Maybe before I go fight him...

6779
04:56:00,850 --> 04:56:02,270
I might go and like...

6780
04:56:02,270 --> 04:56:03,130
grab some rations.

6781
04:56:04,510 --> 04:56:06,430
Um, but I will do that off stream.

6782
04:56:06,870 --> 04:56:08,550
Thanks as always for MGS Brain Rock!

6783
04:56:08,610 --> 04:56:09,750
Good luck with Raven next week!

6784
04:56:09,830 --> 04:56:10,210
Thank you!

6785
04:56:10,790 --> 04:56:11,790
Thank you, thank you guys!

6786
04:56:12,490 --> 04:56:14,570
I made lots and lots of progress today, so...

6787
04:56:14,570 --> 04:56:16,610
Um, and basically...

6788
04:56:16,610 --> 04:56:17,890
Almost...

6789
04:56:18,440 --> 04:56:20,290
Every boss...

6790
04:56:20,290 --> 04:56:21,890
Well, um...

6791
04:56:22,180 --> 04:56:24,110
Most fights in...

6792
04:56:24,110 --> 04:56:26,130
1, 2, 3...

6793
04:56:26,930 --> 04:56:27,630
Tries.

6794
04:56:30,330 --> 04:56:32,150
Most bosses in...

6795
04:56:32,150 --> 04:56:33,790
1, 2, 3 tries.

6796
04:56:38,510 --> 04:56:40,130
Psycho Mantis first try.

6797
04:56:40,270 --> 04:56:40,690
I know!

6798
04:56:40,950 --> 04:56:41,790
I know, right?

6799
04:56:44,070 --> 04:56:45,650
1 HP in a dream, baby.

6800
04:56:46,870 --> 04:56:47,350
Yeah.

6801
04:56:49,030 --> 04:56:49,510
Anyway.

6802
04:56:49,690 --> 04:56:50,530
3 or less!

6803
04:56:50,730 --> 04:56:51,470
3 or less!

6804
04:56:52,650 --> 04:56:53,130
Spank!

6805
04:56:53,130 --> 04:56:53,950
Thank you for the 10 gift!

6806
04:56:54,010 --> 04:56:54,770
Thank you!

6807
04:56:55,010 --> 04:56:56,010
Um, tomorrow...

6808
04:56:56,010 --> 04:56:58,290
Actually, I will be finishing...

6809
04:56:58,290 --> 04:56:59,450
Doom 64.

6810
04:56:59,870 --> 04:57:02,470
But also, I didn't put something on the stream.

6811
04:57:02,710 --> 04:57:03,890
Or on the schedule.

6812
04:57:04,230 --> 04:57:06,030
Of what kind of stream I will be doing.

6813
04:57:06,290 --> 04:57:08,930
But, I will actually be deb- Debuting...

6814
04:57:08,930 --> 04:57:12,150
A new chibi model that I have!

6815
04:57:12,150 --> 04:57:13,530
Ba-ba-da-ba!

6816
04:57:14,710 --> 04:57:15,630
So, um...

6817
04:57:15,630 --> 04:57:17,130
I just kind of got it for fun.

6818
04:57:17,290 --> 04:57:18,670
Because I thought it was pretty cute.

6819
04:57:19,030 --> 04:57:21,430
Um, so I will be debuting that tomorrow!

6820
04:57:23,630 --> 04:57:24,590
And, um...

6821
04:57:25,190 --> 04:57:26,250
Showing you guys...

6822
04:57:26,250 --> 04:57:26,990
That.

6823
04:57:27,530 --> 04:57:28,890
And maybe I'll...

6824
04:57:29,770 --> 04:57:31,550
Use it for streams and stuff.

6825
04:57:31,830 --> 04:57:33,530
So, um...

6826
04:57:34,100 --> 04:57:36,430
Yeah, so after the Doom 64 stream...

6827
04:57:36,430 --> 04:57:37,590
I'll have...

6828
04:57:37,590 --> 04:57:39,690
I'll have that stream as well.

6829
04:57:39,750 --> 04:57:40,410
Thanks for the stream!

6830
04:57:40,510 --> 04:57:41,450
Always a pleasure to share.

6831
04:57:42,150 --> 04:57:42,890
And rock with you, Minto!

6832
04:57:43,610 --> 04:57:44,450
Thank you!

6833
04:57:46,170 --> 04:57:47,010
Appreciate it.

6834
04:57:47,010 --> 04:57:48,290
Thank you guys so much...

6835
04:57:48,290 --> 04:57:49,170
For hanging out with me!

6836
04:57:49,310 --> 04:57:51,030
I appreciate you guys so much.

6837
04:57:51,310 --> 04:57:53,370
You're always, you know...

6838
04:57:53,370 --> 04:57:56,290
Even though it's not me playing for the first time...

6839
04:57:56,290 --> 04:57:57,030
And everything...

6840
04:57:57,030 --> 04:58:00,090
But you guys all still, you know, hang out...

6841
04:58:00,090 --> 04:58:02,090
And still...

6842
04:58:02,090 --> 04:58:03,550
Um, you know...

6843
04:58:04,000 --> 04:58:06,250
Still take the time to watch me.

6844
04:58:07,900 --> 04:58:09,070
And I'm really appreciative.

6845
04:58:09,830 --> 04:58:10,550
Thank you.

6846
04:58:12,150 --> 04:58:12,910
Thank you so much.

6847
04:58:13,150 --> 04:58:15,970
I'm really happy that I can play this again...

6848
04:58:15,970 --> 04:58:16,870
And have so much fun.

6849
04:58:17,770 --> 04:58:19,130
So, thank you!

6850
04:58:21,370 --> 04:58:22,330
And, um...

6851
04:58:22,330 --> 04:58:24,530
There was one other thing I was gonna say...

6852
04:58:25,150 --> 04:58:26,070
I don't remember.

6853
04:58:27,290 --> 04:58:28,270
I don't remember.

6854
04:58:28,710 --> 04:58:29,610
It's fine, though.

6855
04:58:31,830 --> 04:58:32,310
Um...

6856
04:58:33,850 --> 04:58:34,330
Hilbert!

6857
04:58:34,510 --> 04:58:35,450
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

6858
04:58:35,690 --> 04:58:36,310
Thank you!

6859
04:58:36,530 --> 04:58:37,370
Thank you, thank you!

6860
04:58:38,730 --> 04:58:39,690
Okay, um...

6861
04:58:39,690 --> 04:58:40,090
Cool!

6862
04:58:40,230 --> 04:58:41,650
Then I'm gonna go...

6863
04:58:43,010 --> 04:58:44,830
Metal Gear next week will...

6864
04:58:44,830 --> 04:58:46,770
The continuation will actually be on Wednesday.

6865
04:58:47,790 --> 04:58:48,830
Because, um...

6866
04:58:50,130 --> 04:58:50,650
Uh...

6867
04:58:50,650 --> 04:58:52,570
Because I have to...

6868
04:58:52,570 --> 04:58:55,350
Be ready for the concert...

6869
04:58:55,350 --> 04:58:56,430
On Friday.

6870
04:58:57,490 --> 04:58:58,010
Um...

6871
04:58:58,010 --> 04:59:00,170
And I will still be at AX on Saturday.

6872
04:59:01,010 --> 04:59:01,530
Um...

6873
04:59:01,530 --> 04:59:04,290
I might do a stream when I get back on Sunday.

6874
04:59:04,350 --> 04:59:04,850
We'll see.

6875
04:59:06,390 --> 04:59:07,730
Not quite sure yet.

6876
04:59:07,910 --> 04:59:09,630
I don't remember what time I get back.

6877
04:59:09,930 --> 04:59:11,430
I might have gotten a red eye.

6878
04:59:12,390 --> 04:59:13,930
I don't quite remember.

6879
04:59:14,790 --> 04:59:15,390
So...

6880
04:59:16,090 --> 04:59:17,570
How far did you get again?

6881
04:59:17,690 --> 04:59:20,930
Oh, we're just about to fight Vulcan Raven.

6882
04:59:21,270 --> 04:59:21,870
So...

6883
04:59:22,530 --> 04:59:24,510
I only follow one person.

6884
04:59:24,550 --> 04:59:25,010
The boss.

6885
04:59:25,190 --> 04:59:25,730
Big boss.

6886
04:59:25,930 --> 04:59:26,390
You!

6887
04:59:26,690 --> 04:59:27,210
Me!

6888
04:59:29,250 --> 04:59:30,270
Oh my gosh.

6889
04:59:30,370 --> 04:59:32,030
I'm so excited for Delta.

6890
04:59:32,110 --> 04:59:33,330
I can't wait.

6891
04:59:34,170 --> 04:59:38,130
Yeah, we're really close to...

6892
04:59:38,910 --> 04:59:40,550
I'm turning these birds down.

6893
04:59:40,910 --> 04:59:41,750
I'm really...

6894
04:59:42,150 --> 04:59:43,030
I'm really close to beating this.

6895
04:59:43,190 --> 04:59:45,030
So I think on Wednesday we'll definitely be able to.

6896
04:59:45,090 --> 04:59:46,830
So sorry that it's not a Metal Gear Saturday.

6897
04:59:47,410 --> 04:59:50,110
But I didn't want to skip a whole week.

6898
04:59:50,690 --> 04:59:51,110
So...

6899
04:59:52,310 --> 04:59:52,730
Then...

6900
04:59:52,730 --> 04:59:55,330
The following weekend we'll start MGS2!

6901
04:59:56,370 --> 04:59:56,790
Yippee!

6902
04:59:59,210 --> 05:00:00,130
Yay, yay, yay!

6903
05:00:01,150 --> 05:00:02,570
I'm so hyped for Delta.

6904
05:00:02,750 --> 05:00:05,050
The more I hear about it, the more I'm hyped.

6905
05:00:05,150 --> 05:00:05,690
I know, right?

6906
05:00:06,530 --> 05:00:06,950
Yeah.

6907
05:00:08,330 --> 05:00:09,410
Me too, honestly.

6908
05:00:10,110 --> 05:00:10,850
Okie dokie!

6909
05:00:12,310 --> 05:00:12,870
Lalilulelo!

6910
05:00:14,890 --> 05:00:15,450
Ok!

6911
05:00:15,630 --> 05:00:16,490
Thank you guys!

6912
05:00:17,870 --> 05:00:19,310
I did save, right?

6913
05:00:19,910 --> 05:00:20,870
I did save.

6914
05:00:21,350 --> 05:00:22,650
Ok, I think so.

6915
05:00:24,130 --> 05:00:24,690
Alright!

6916
05:00:25,550 --> 05:00:26,110
Otzuminto!

6917
05:00:27,690 --> 05:00:28,250
Otzuminto!

6918
05:00:28,390 --> 05:00:28,930
Otzuminto!

6919
05:00:29,230 --> 05:00:30,810
I will see you guys...

6920
05:00:31,390 --> 05:00:31,950
Tomorrow?

6921
05:00:33,710 --> 05:00:34,830
And... yeah!

6922
05:00:36,950 --> 05:00:38,110
Schedule for next week.

6923
05:00:38,290 --> 05:00:39,530
I'm almost done making it.

6924
05:00:41,470 --> 05:00:42,570
I have another collab.

6925
05:00:43,170 --> 05:00:44,350
With a certain bird.

6926
05:00:46,830 --> 05:00:47,910
Actually, I asked her.

6927
05:00:48,210 --> 05:00:50,270
Because I've always wanted to play this game with someone.

6928
05:00:50,650 --> 05:00:52,610
And so I asked her if she would play it with me.

6929
05:00:53,030 --> 05:00:54,470
I thought it would be a fun game.

6930
05:00:54,610 --> 05:00:56,110
That she and I can kind of...

6931
05:00:56,990 --> 05:00:58,310
Be really dumb with.

6932
05:00:59,090 --> 05:00:59,930
So, actually...

6933
05:01:01,590 --> 05:01:03,170
Doki and I will be playing...

6934
05:01:03,810 --> 05:01:04,710
Man of Medan.

6935
05:01:06,570 --> 05:01:08,330
Because I thought that we could make...

6936
05:01:08,330 --> 05:01:09,470
Really dumb choices.

6937
05:01:09,470 --> 05:01:09,510
And...

6938
05:01:09,510 --> 05:01:11,570
To kind of troll each other.

6939
05:01:11,810 --> 05:01:13,110
On each...

6940
05:01:13,110 --> 05:01:14,350
On each...

6941
05:01:15,150 --> 05:01:16,630
Side, so...

6942
05:01:20,070 --> 05:01:21,670
But yeah...

6943
05:01:21,670 --> 05:01:24,170
This is MGS number 2.

6944
05:01:24,210 --> 05:01:25,530
It's MGS part 2!

6945
05:01:25,830 --> 05:01:27,350
Should I change the...

6946
05:01:27,350 --> 05:01:29,410
Should I change the...

6947
05:01:29,410 --> 05:01:30,370
Stream title?

6948
05:01:30,470 --> 05:01:32,090
People are getting so confused.

6949
05:01:34,750 --> 05:01:35,870
But yeah...

6950
05:01:35,870 --> 05:01:36,990
So...

6951
05:01:37,510 --> 05:01:38,110
Um...

6952
05:01:39,510 --> 05:01:40,990
I thought that would be kind of fun.

6953
05:01:42,430 --> 05:01:43,310
Okie dokie!

6954
05:01:44,510 --> 05:01:45,350
It's clear.

6955
05:01:45,490 --> 05:01:45,870
IMO.

6956
05:01:46,050 --> 05:01:46,750
Nowhere dumb.

6957
05:01:46,870 --> 05:01:47,830
The title is clear.

6958
05:01:50,830 --> 05:01:52,790
Metal Gear Solid...

6959
05:01:54,410 --> 05:01:54,990
Mmm...

6960
05:01:55,830 --> 05:01:57,770
I never have had this issue before.

6961
05:01:58,130 --> 05:01:58,850
Maybe I...

6962
05:01:58,850 --> 05:02:00,330
I used to always put that like...

6963
05:02:00,330 --> 05:02:01,210
Hashtag.

6964
05:02:01,210 --> 05:02:01,550
Like...

6965
05:02:01,550 --> 05:02:02,930
Hashtag 02.

6966
05:02:03,550 --> 05:02:05,410
So maybe I should put...

6967
05:02:05,410 --> 05:02:08,110
Metal Gear Solid number 02.

6968
05:02:09,510 --> 05:02:09,670
But...

6969
05:02:09,670 --> 05:02:11,330
I thought having the part...

6970
05:02:11,330 --> 05:02:12,990
Just made it obvious, right?

6971
05:02:13,790 --> 05:02:14,270
Utano!

6972
05:02:16,450 --> 05:02:17,790
Thank you for membership!

6973
05:02:18,430 --> 05:02:19,250
Oh my gosh!

6974
05:02:19,330 --> 05:02:19,610
Wait!

6975
05:02:19,690 --> 05:02:20,930
I'm so excited for Friday!

6976
05:02:22,210 --> 05:02:24,230
Utano will also be at the concert with me!

6977
05:02:24,390 --> 05:02:24,930
You guys!

6978
05:02:25,430 --> 05:02:27,230
And she sings so beautifully!

6979
05:02:28,550 --> 05:02:30,430
So we're gonna have a lot of fun!

6980
05:02:32,150 --> 05:02:32,990
Oh my gosh!

6981
05:02:33,110 --> 05:02:33,990
I can't wait to meet you!

6982
05:02:33,990 --> 05:02:34,070
PT too!

6983
05:02:37,710 --> 05:02:38,470
Yippie yippie!

6984
05:02:39,630 --> 05:02:40,150
Ok.

6985
05:02:40,230 --> 05:02:41,750
Maybe I won't write PT too.

6986
05:02:41,830 --> 05:02:43,050
I'll write part 2.

6987
05:02:43,590 --> 05:02:44,850
I'll just write it out.

6988
05:02:44,970 --> 05:02:45,250
Anyways.

6989
05:02:45,790 --> 05:02:47,830
I've blabbered on enough.

6990
05:02:48,010 --> 05:02:48,690
Thank you guys!

6991
05:02:49,010 --> 05:02:49,990
See you guys tomorrow!

6992
05:02:50,790 --> 05:02:51,750
And... yeah!

6993
05:02:52,730 --> 05:02:53,250
Otsumito!

6994
05:02:54,190 --> 05:02:55,230
Bye bye!

6995
05:02:56,330 --> 05:02:58,010
See you guys later!

6996
05:02:58,690 --> 05:02:59,550
Bye bye!
