1
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,910
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,330
Hello, everybody.

3
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,890
Hold on.

4
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,290
Wait.

5
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,990
There we go.

6
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,310
Wait.

7
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,590
Actually, hold on.

8
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,330
Let me remove some stuff around.

9
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,130
That's better.

10
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,590
Yippee!

11
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,270
Welcome.

12
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,430
Welcome.

13
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,550
Oh, I forgot to say.

14
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,450
Welcome.

15
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,050
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

16
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,950
Welcome back to Oblivion.

17
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,570
Oh, gosh.

18
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,130
It's been so long since I played.

19
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,490
It's been so long.

20
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,910
Well, now I remember how to kill people.

21
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
Wow, it's your first time playing Oblivion?

22
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,010
It is.

23
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,110
Yeah.

24
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,590
So, uh, yeah.

25
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,990
Hope you're feeling good today.

26
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,690
I am.

27
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,690
I'm feeling pretty good.

28
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm feeling, I'm feeling okay.

29
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,170
Um, yeah.

30
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm feeling okay.

31
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,750
And, uh, I'm ready to, to play.

32
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,670
What was I gonna say?

33
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,350
Sorry.

34
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,110
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,330
I feel like... I feel so out of it.

36
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,910
I feel so, like...

37
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,550
Hold on.

38
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,870
I feel so, like...

39
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,950
When I don't stream consistently...

40
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,810
My brain forgets how...

41
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,450
To stream...

42
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,690
Just watch the new MGS Delta video.

43
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,810
Oh, my God.

44
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,430
Me too.

45
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,430
I watched it earlier.

46
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,610
If you guys haven't seen it.

47
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,170
They had...

48
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,150
They had...

49
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,530
My Oshi, actually.

50
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,070
They had my Oshi in the video.

51
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,910
So, Konami put out a thing for Delta.

52
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,950
And they got, like, some people that were involved in Delta.

53
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,450
To...

54
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,470
To...

55
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,090
Like, talk about it and stuff.

56
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,550
Of...

57
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,450
And...

58
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,370
My Oshi.

59
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,070
Her name is Ruby Taki.

60
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,190
And she's...

61
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,490
She's, like...

62
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,490
The best ever...

63
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,250
Metal Gear...

64
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,090
Cosplayer...

65
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,210
Ever.

66
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,050
She's so...

67
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,930
Oh, my gosh.

68
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,650
If you never...

69
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,470
Just Google Ruby Taki.

70
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,650
And...

71
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,050
If you see...

72
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,630
A Metal Gear Rex.

73
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,630
She made that.

74
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,050
She made that.

75
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,790
Mental health fun.

76
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,550
Thank you.

77
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,670
Thank you.

78
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,310
Thank you.

79
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,310
Yeah.

80
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,250
She's crazy.

81
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,150
She's so awesome.

82
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,970
I love her.

83
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,510
I have her pictures...

84
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,890
On my fridge.

85
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,950
I love her stuff so much.

86
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,830
Yeah.

87
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,710
So, I'm...

88
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm a...

89
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm a...

90
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,130
I'm a Minimal fan.

91
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,370
And when I saw her, I was like...

92
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,070
She's there.

93
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,650
If anybody deserves it, she does.

94
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,850
I will miss Deer Stage.

95
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,450
I also miss the milk shop at the Akiba Station platform.

96
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,050
Wait, stop.

97
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,750
I don't...

98
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,370
I don't...

99
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,790
I haven't seen new Akiba Station yet.

100
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,910
No spoilers.

101
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,230
I haven't seen it yet.

102
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,910
You're one of her fans.

103
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,450
Yeah, I'm a big fan.

104
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,750
I'm a big fan.

105
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,730
I'm excited.

106
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,230
For Delta.

107
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,530
I was...

108
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,170
I was...

109
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,870
So...

110
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,930
I...

111
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,630
Um...

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,950
I...

113
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,850
Um...

114
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,950
What was it?

115
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,470
The...

116
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,410
The...

117
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,630
Oh, the people...

118
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,330
So...

119
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,290
Konami has been sending out...

120
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,890
PR boxes to people...

121
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,010
For Metal Gear.

122
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,150
And...

123
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,950
Um...

124
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,670
I saw...

125
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,750
I saw Maddie.

126
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,890
My friend Maddie.

127
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,070
She was like...

128
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,470
Oh, I'm kind of jealous of people getting those boxes.

129
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,730
And I've been like...

130
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,530
Kind of trying not to...

131
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,350
To look at any of them.

132
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,030
Because I was like...

133
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,610
Oh, I don't know...

134
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,530
Fingers crossed, maybe.

135
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,850
Maybe I'll just...

136
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,010
I'll just check my...

137
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,810
I'll be a little more diligent checking my email or something.

138
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,270
And then I saw a post...

139
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,070
Today.

140
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,730
And I was like...

141
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,070
Oh...

142
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,410
Maddie commented on it.

143
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,390
I saw...

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,830
Also...

145
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,570
Someone else...

146
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,010
A couple other people were just like...

147
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,910
Oh, I kind of want one.

148
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,290
And then they sent them to...

149
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:35,870
To them.

150
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,790
But I'm a little few days late.

151
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,170
So I was like...

152
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,070
Well, you know what?

153
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,510
Let me just shoot my shot.

154
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,350
And that was like...

155
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,670
There were so many people that responded.

156
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,310
There were so many people that responded.

157
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,450
Being like...

158
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,750
Meant to get a box.

159
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,610
I was like crying about it.

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,590
I'm going to cry about it again.

161
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,090
Because I was like...

162
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,070
You guys didn't have to do that.

163
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,330
So...

164
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,830
I was like...

165
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:13,910
I was like...

166
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,470
Oh...

167
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,540
So...

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
If I get one...

169
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Thank you guys.

170
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,640
If I get one...

171
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,660
Of course I will...

172
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,200
Show it off for you guys.

173
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,660
And everything.

174
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,170
I'll offer my Kamiyoshi...

175
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,970
My vocal cords.

176
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,110
No...

177
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,590
Ender!

178
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,090
Dude!

179
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,910
I saw you notice...

180
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,610
My handiwork...

181
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,470
At the PAX East...

182
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,250
Info booth.

183
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,550
Oh!

184
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,230
The plushie.

185
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,650
I've been working there...

186
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,290
For 10 years now.

187
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:48,910
And I always...

188
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,310
Try to have a little mascot...

189
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,010
There to entertain...

190
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,010
The attendees one year.

191
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,970
It was some...

192
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,730
Weirdo elf...

193
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,070
That I strapped to a toy...

194
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,470
Horse.

195
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,690
Horse.

196
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,450
Oh!

197
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,650
Was she...

198
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,250
A cowboy?

199
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,830
They're actually just gonna send you...

200
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,830
Snake in a box.

201
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,550
I hope...

202
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,890
They send me...

203
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,010
A live snake.

204
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,910
And they say...

205
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,290
Prove your loyalty.

206
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,150
Eat the snake.

207
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,910
If you love snakes so much...

208
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,210
Why don't you eat it?

209
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,590
Then I'll be like...

210
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:25,970
Okay...

211
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,170
Thank you for the re...

212
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,690
Thank you for the redirect...

213
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,150
Thank you!

214
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,570
Thank you so much.

215
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,910
Hello, hello.

216
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,010
Sorry, I'm talking about eating snakes.

217
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,170
But yeah...

218
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,950
So that happened this morning...

219
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,270
And I was just like...

220
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,170
Oh, you guys...

221
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,630
Maybe they'll notice me.

222
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
Maybe they'll be like...

223
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,670
Oh, man.

224
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,650
This girl's...

225
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,130
Got some really loud fans.

226
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,550
Can't say goodbye to yesterday...

227
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,510
It's over 100k views.

228
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,630
Thank you!

229
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,890
Guys for...

230
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,090
Thank you so much...

231
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,930
For watching it.

232
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,850
I know it's not like the...

233
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,290
You know...

234
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,050
It's not like a...

235
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,110
Like a...

236
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,330
A song that is so popular...

237
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,490
That people would always...

238
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,410
Click and listen to.

239
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,670
So I really appreciate...

240
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,890
That it's at...

241
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,850
100k views.

242
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,550
Thank you!

243
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,390
And...

244
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,370
Um...

245
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,230
I also released a cover yesterday...

246
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,910
That...

247
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,430
Is at 50k views.

248
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,230
So thank you!

249
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,490
Thank you.

250
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,750
I just kind of put out...

251
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,870
I actually was supposed to schedule it...

252
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,930
Earlier and then...

253
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,170
I forgot...

254
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,550
Eat that snake.

255
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,010
Yeah!

256
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,330
I'll eat it.

257
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,050
Bones and all.

258
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,070
Yesterday's was a jump scare.

259
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,250
Well, I gotta keep you guys on your toes.

260
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,570
I only...

261
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,890
Have one more cover planned.

262
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,030
Oh, I still have to record it though.

263
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,650
So...

264
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,850
So it might be a little bit more time.

265
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,430
Plus the music video is not...

266
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,810
Finished for it either.

267
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,250
But all the animation and stuff is finished for it.

268
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,910
That one will probably also be a jump scare.

269
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,010
That one will probably also be a jump scare.

270
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,450
Hmm.

271
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,550
Whenever I get to record it.

272
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,110
Right now I have too many other things to record.

273
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,470
And my voice is still kind of...

274
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,030
So I will wait for a little bit longer before...

275
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,430
I can record it.

276
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,610
Nah.

277
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,650
Hehehe.

278
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,460
I want you guys to know though...

279
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Half...

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,740
Part of me resting is also so that...

281
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,620
I can...

282
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,780
Do things...

283
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,300
Like...

284
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,900
So...

285
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm not like putting a pause on all...

286
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
The activities I have going on.

287
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,900
Like part of the resting is so that...

288
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,260
I don't burn my voice out...

289
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,500
All day...

290
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,760
Hehehe.

291
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,400
From streaming.

292
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,880
And then I can't record other things.

293
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,300
So...

294
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,000
Do the do.

295
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,660
Hehehe.

296
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,480
So...

297
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,020
Um...

298
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,220
Yeah.

299
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,420
That's kind of part of it.

300
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:22,980
So...

301
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,360
There will be other things that will...

302
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,760
Um...

303
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,680
Be happening.

304
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,140
Something's me...

305
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,020
I don't want to say any more.

306
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,520
Hahaha.

307
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
I don't want to say anything...

308
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,280
More...

309
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,020
Actually...

310
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,460
I should start playing the game, huh?

311
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,080
Because...

312
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,140
I have some meetings tonight...

313
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,040
That I...

314
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,980
I...

315
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,480
I...

316
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,720
Okay.

317
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,760
I'm so stupid.

318
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,680
They were like...

319
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,060
They were like...

320
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,840
Let's meet at...

321
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,580
6 p.m...

322
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,220
PST.

323
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,620
And I was like...

324
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay.

325
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,080
3 p.m...

326
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,000
E.S.T.

327
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,060
Hahaha.

328
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,910
Hahaha.

329
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,610
Hahaha.

330
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,490
Oopsy.

331
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,230
Oopsie.

332
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,370
Oopsy.

333
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,010
So...

334
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,630
Hahaha.

335
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,650
So...

336
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,450
So...

337
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,750
I...

338
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,610
That's why I had to move the stream a little bit.

339
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,090
Because I was like...

340
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,170
Hehehehe.

341
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,210
Hehehehe.

342
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,550
3 p.m.

343
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,370
EST.

344
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,850
And then it became 3 p.m.

345
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,030
And I was like, where are they?

346
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,690
I think they're late.

347
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,730
I hope they're not watching right now, because this would be so bad.

348
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,650
If they're like, oh, we heard that you wait.

349
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,960
But yeah.

350
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,260
And then, later this week, I leave for Japan.

351
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,920
I'll be gone for a little bit.

352
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,320
But you will see me on Coyote's 3D Graduation Live.

353
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Concert?

354
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,340
And so, you'll see me then.

355
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,760
And I'll try to do some Twitter spaces.

356
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,420
While I'm gone.

357
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I just wail.

358
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,620
And probably a 24-hour stream thingy.

359
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

360
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,360
Still have a collab with Coyote this week?

362
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,240
Yes.

363
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,960
Tomorrow morning, my time.

364
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
10 a.m.

365
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,680
EST.

366
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,800
Well, I don't know what we're playing yet.

367
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
Minto Health No.

368
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,480
1.

369
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,760
Opportunities Projects No.

370
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,100
2.

371
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,220
Stream No.

372
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,560
3.

373
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,260
Opportunities and Projects No.

374
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,660
1.

375
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,020
Oh my gosh.

376
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Thank you for the Augustine, but thank you.

377
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,680
After 5 months of absent interviews, I finally have a new job.

378
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,860
Let's go!

379
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,140
Oh my gosh.

380
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,680
Congratulations!

381
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,260
Congrats!

382
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,220
Wait.

383
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,920
Discard Capitor.

384
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,580
So gross!

385
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,440
Wait, that's such a clever name.

386
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,100
Congratulations!

387
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,020
Sorry.

388
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,760
I can't...

389
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,860
I can't hear my voice.

390
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,840
It's kind of...

391
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,180
Not so great today.

392
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,360
So let's just...

393
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,180
Continue.

394
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:31,860
Oh wait.

395
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,580
Load?

396
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,560
E-Tina.

397
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,500
Uy.

398
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,520
Safe travels, Minky.

399
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,120
Thank you!

400
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,780
Thank you, thank you.

401
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
So tomorrow will just be me and...

402
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,420
I will just have the stream...

403
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,980
I don't know if I actually will stream.

404
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,800
It will depend on what game we play.

405
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,260
But uh...

406
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,380
This might be streamed for this week.

407
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,660
I'm so sorry, you guys.

408
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,460
I will win for Minky.

409
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,340
I will win for all of us.

410
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,220
Cease those...

411
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,940
Cease?

412
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,500
Cease?

413
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,840
Cease?

414
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,040
Thank you, Tuna.

415
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,940
Stop those activities.

416
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,320
Cease.

417
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,220
Cease.

418
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Okay.

419
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,420
We're here.

420
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,860
We just joined the...

421
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,640
The...

422
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,020
The...

423
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,500
The sisterhood...

424
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,020
Brotherhood.

425
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,580
Of darkness.

426
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,620
Cease.

427
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,600
Cease.

428
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh yeah, I stopped right on this view.

429
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah, this is the town that I want to live in.

430
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,980
But...

431
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,820
People were telling me...

432
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,500
That there is...

433
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,320
A haunted house.

434
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
In Anvil?

435
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,620
Was it?

436
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,800
Anvil.

437
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,020
The sisterhood of a brotherhood.

438
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah.

439
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,860
Yes.

440
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,360
Okay.

441
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,440
I want a haunted house.

442
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
But we also have to go kill some pirates.

443
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,020
Maybe I'll go do that now.

444
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,760
Right?

445
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,540
Wait, quests.

446
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,420
Oh my gosh, you guys.

447
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,140
I got fantasy life.

448
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
Sorry I'm not streaming it.

449
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,140
I kind of wanted to just have a game...

450
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,860
That I can play at my own pace.

451
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,340
And...

452
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm a fisher.

453
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm a fisher.

454
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,610
Go to the waterfront...

455
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,830
And gain access to the pirate ship.

456
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,370
Oh, we gotta kill the captain.

457
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,110
Yeah, I might have to be in one of the crates.

458
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:04,410
Okay.

459
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,030
Okay.

460
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,870
Wait, I'm gonna fast travel to there.

461
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,450
Can I?

462
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,030
Yes.

463
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,610
So, I got it.

464
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,750
But I got it for the Switch.

465
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,290
But people were telling me...

466
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,590
That you can...

467
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,130
Okay, so I got it for the Switch.

468
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,510
Because obviously the original fantasy life was the...

469
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,470
Was the 3DS, right?

470
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,050
And I got it.

471
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,990
Because I was like...

472
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,170
Because I was like...

473
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,410
Oh man...

474
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,630
I...

475
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,750
Just...

476
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,070
It just felt right.

477
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,930
I don't know.

478
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,790
The haunted house is cheap too.

479
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,450
It's the only house I could ever afford in a...

480
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,270
I mean...

481
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,950
Dang.

482
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,370
Wait, I kind of want to hear them sing.

483
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,390
Good morning.

484
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,430
No, no, no.

485
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,750
This guy always sings for us.

486
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,710
Oh, hey, sweet lady of Wayrest.

487
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,150
Oh, hey, sweet lady of mine.

488
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,010
I'll see you again.

489
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,010
Yes, I'll see you again.

490
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,650
Sweet lady of Wayrest.

491
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,230
So fun.

492
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:02,730
Fuck.

493
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,590
Want to show off my new profile picture by Tuna?

494
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,070
It looks great, Liam.

495
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,590
Oh, wait.

496
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,330
You believe you could effectively hide in this crate...

497
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,530
And then be transported to the pirate ship.

498
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,430
Marie Alina, do you wish to hide in the crate?

499
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,310
Or try to find your own way aboard the ship?

500
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,690
I could hide in the crate.

501
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,050
Fantasy life would be cool for swimming...

502
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,230
But a few months are going to be weird.

503
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah.

504
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,990
I just wanted...

505
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,570
Also, I'm going to play the heck out of it on the plane.

506
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,450
Congrats on the cover.

507
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,450
Thank you.

508
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:37,410
Yeah.

509
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,510
I'm sorry to jump scare you guys.

510
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,810
But thank you for listening to it.

511
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,850
And please keep listening to it.

512
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,670
Hide in the crate.

514
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,570
Just a crate.

515
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,290
Just a crate.

516
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,150
Gaston.

517
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,230
Oh my gosh, we have to kill Gaston.

518
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,890
Oh, shoot.

519
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,290
Wait, how do I get my weapon out?

520
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,750
Oh, shoot.

521
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,970
Wait, how do I get my...

522
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,350
Wait.

523
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,850
How do I get my weapon out?

524
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,150
What's the...

525
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,930
What's the key?

526
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,430
Oh, I thought it was one.

527
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,050
What is it?

528
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,210
Oh no.

529
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,210
Wait, I have a...

530
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,930
Am I fine?

531
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,610
Wait.

532
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,570
Which one's better?

533
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,290
Oh, they're both the same.

534
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,230
Iron arrow.

535
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:29,730
Wait, no.

536
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,370
Steel arrow.

537
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,870
Okay.

538
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,690
F.

539
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,110
Okay.

540
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,150
Quick save.

541
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,270
Thank you, guys.

542
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,250
Okay.

543
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,290
I'm here.

544
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,390
And I'm sneaking.

545
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,250
Why is the music...

546
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,770
The music is way too calm for what I'm about to do.

547
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,110
The music is way too like...

548
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,790
Lala.

549
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,330
You are in a journey.

550
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,710
What is this?

551
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,750
What's the point of this room?

552
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,920
Where's your Capitan?

553
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,820
I think I know what's full in that sack.

554
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,720
There's just...

555
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,560
There's peanuts.

556
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,300
15th was my birthday.

557
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Happy birthday, KC.

558
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,700
Sorry for it being delayed.

559
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,620
Happy, happy birthday.

560
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,020
Hold on.

561
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,320
I don't want to open more stuff.

562
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,640
Fur...

563
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,780
Gauntlet.

564
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,540
This is where I was at.

565
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,660
Oh, gosh.

566
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,480
That probably stank.

567
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,420
They have nothing in here.

568
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,240
Alright.

569
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,600
I quicksaved.

570
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,120
Wait.

571
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,240
Let me quicksave again.

572
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,420
For my fursuit.

573
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,800
Yeah.

574
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,600
Wait.

575
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,380
There's a lockpick?

576
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,860
Did I miss it?

577
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,980
Oh.

578
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Good eye.

579
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,240
More beans.

580
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:06,900
Wait.

581
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,120
Gosh, they got a lot of sacks in the end.

582
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,760
Okay.

583
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,440
Thank you, guys.

584
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,590
Wait.

585
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,410
Mid deck.

586
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,710
Okay.

587
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,690
I'm scared.

588
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,410
Oh.

589
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,570
Oh, it autosaved.

590
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,590
Why'd it do that?

591
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,770
Wooden door.

592
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,130
Someone's diary.

593
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,870
Oh, it's about Morrowind.

594
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,430
Okay.

595
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,150
I'm telling you, lad.

596
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,430
It's bad luck.

597
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,530
A woman on board a pirate vessel.

598
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,050
Back in my day, it never would have happened.

599
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,620
Uh-oh.

600
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,580
Captain Tussaud keeps her on for...

601
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,900
Hold there, laddie!

602
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,940
Are they upstairs?

603
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,000
That guy sounded like right next to us.

604
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,620
She may be tougher than me.

605
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,500
And Mina, too.

606
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,040
No girls allowed.

607
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,960
That's not even possible.

608
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,160
All right.

609
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,390
I told you a million times it wasn't my fault.

610
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,970
The wheel was covered with gull droppings.

611
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,950
I can't tell if they're here.

612
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,610
Okay, let's go try...

613
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,090
I don't...

614
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,730
Okay, we're looking for Gaston, everybody.

615
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,040
Someone's bed.

616
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,780
Ah, dang.

617
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,800
We could take their food.

618
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Have them starve.

619
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,880
This place is...

620
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,100
This place is barnacles!

621
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,880
I could sleep in their bed.

622
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,860
What if I just kill the whole crew, though, you know?

623
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,320
The door's open!

624
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,140
Who opened it?

625
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,640
Behind me?

626
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,700
No?

627
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm so scared.

628
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,420
I'm so scared right now.

629
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,440
Wait.

630
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
I see somebody there on the bed.

631
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,380
I think that's our man.

632
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,500
There we go.

633
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,800
Oops.

634
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,400
One moment.

635
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,900
One moment.

636
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,720
Oh, shoot.

637
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,400
It was just a pirate.

638
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,820
Oh, here they come.

639
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,360
I'll get their hand.

640
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:13,820
Oh!

641
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,440
Oh!

642
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,660
Oh!

643
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,380
Oh!

644
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,040
Oh!

645
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,680
Oh!

646
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,440
Oh, shoot.

647
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,060
Oh, God.

648
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,480
I'm so dead.

649
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,040
Kill him!

650
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:21,940
Ow!

651
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,560
I can't move!

652
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,120
Oh, gosh.

653
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,420
Yeah!

654
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:24,780
Die!

655
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,400
Die, pirate!

656
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,240
This ends here!

657
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,860
Gosh.

658
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,700
Take all my arrows back.

659
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,220
I thought you were the captain!

660
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,420
Oh, golly.

661
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,860
Okay, well, so much for that.

662
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Take his fancy cutlass.

663
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,980
It's heavy.

664
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,860
It's heavy, though.

665
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,140
She's got a pickaxe.

666
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,620
What are you?

667
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,580
Steve?

668
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,660
Capitan!

669
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,700
Capitan!

670
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,900
This music is really...

671
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,440
Just not the mood here.

672
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,780
Where the hell is the captain?

673
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,040
And where's all your money?

674
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,860
Worst pirates of the seven seas.

675
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,420
This ends here.

676
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,320
Instantly dies.

677
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,720
Oh.

678
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,840
Oh.

679
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,300
Oh.

680
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,940
See?

681
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,400
I was looking at the marker.

682
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
And it said...

683
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,980
Like, five steps here.

684
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,300
So I assumed...

685
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,040
It...

686
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,460
Here we go.

687
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,410
I must now kill Gaston Toussaint.

688
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,120
I hear a worm...

689
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,580
Oh, what was that?

690
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,280
What was that?

691
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,560
Is that him on the table?

692
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,680
Oh, I think that is.

693
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,880
No kidding?

694
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,320
What if he wants to talk?

695
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,390
Yeah, the book moved by itself.

696
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,830
Green arrow means it's him.

697
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,690
Ah, I see.

698
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,990
I don't think he does.

699
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,490
You can talk to him.

700
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,090
You're not in the Brotherhood of Yapping.

701
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,930
But like...

702
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,030
His booty is very hard.

703
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,110
Fall of the Snow Prince is a literature man.

704
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,490
Oh, he sees me.

705
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,610
100%.

706
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,850
Oh.

707
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,690
Oh, shoot.

708
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,470
Oh, okay.

709
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,470
Never mind.

710
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,530
Wait.

711
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,370
What?

712
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,330
Um...

713
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,850
Oh, I don't want to pick your pockets.

714
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,310
Sorry.

715
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,210
Or in blazes.

716
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,850
You ain't one of me crew.

717
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,550
You best start explaining yourself, mate.

718
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,250
If you want to get off this ship alive.

719
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,550
This is the captain.

720
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,690
He barely looks like a pirate.

721
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,170
Say nothing.

722
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,670
Justice is at hand, pirate.

723
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,310
The Dread Father summons you.

724
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,390
Thank you.

725
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,710
Ah, what are you?

726
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,210
Some kind of preacher or something?

727
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,610
One of them crazies from the church?

728
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,490
I ain't got time for this.

729
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,790
Oh, shoot.

730
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,510
Let me get my thing out.

731
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,990
Oh, shoot.

732
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,190
Oh, my God.

733
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,990
Oh, my God.

734
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,470
He's fast.

735
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,730
Oh, shoot.

736
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,850
I need to actually hit him.

737
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,530
Oh, my God.

738
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,790
Yeah.

739
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,430
Take that.

740
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,670
It does.

741
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,470
With you.

742
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,490
You'll never take...

743
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,150
Well, that'll never take away.

744
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,290
Gaston is now dead.

745
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,430
I must now return to the sanctuary and speak with V-Vincent Valtteri to receive my reward.

746
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,630
Oh, hi, dog, baby.

747
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,170
He has it!

748
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,590
The Lusty Arc Guardian made!

749
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,450
The book!

750
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,100
The fu- Wait.

751
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,600
Wait.

752
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:33,900
Wait.

753
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,520
Oh, wait.

754
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,060
Where is it?

755
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,500
I love so many things.

756
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,200
Oh, here we go.

757
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,280
What is the warp in the west?

758
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,460
When did I grab that?

759
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
What do you mean it's only three pages?

760
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,920
Act...

761
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,180
Four...

762
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,760
Scene three...

763
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,680
Continued.

764
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,700
Lifts her tail.

765
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,440
Is that her name?

766
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

767
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:11,830
ha ha!

768
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:12,870
Golly.

769
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,830
Lifts her tail.

770
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,070
Certainly not kind, sir.

771
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,890
I am here but to clean your chambers.

772
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,060
Crantius Cullto.

773
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,610
Is that all you have come here for, little one?

774
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,190
My chambers?

775
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,710
Lifts her tail.

776
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,090
I have no idea what it is you imply, master.

777
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,250
I am but a poor Argonian maid.

778
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,750
So you are my dumpling.

779
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,850
And a good one at that.

780
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,290
Such strong legs and shapely tail.

781
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,050
You embarrass me, sir.

782
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,090
Fear not.

783
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,050
You are safe here with me.

784
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,870
I must finish my cleaning, sir.

785
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,810
The mistress will have my head if I do not.

786
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,610
Cleaning, eh?

787
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,410
I have something for you.

788
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,770
Here, polish my spear.

789
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,630
But it's huge!

790
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,310
It could take me all night.

791
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,810
Plenty of time, my sweet.

792
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,710
Plenty of time.

793
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,010
That's it!

794
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,920
Wait, is there more?

795
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,140
Or...

796
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,380
How does this rate against the other monster romance books?

797
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,440
Pretty...

798
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
Pretty average.

799
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,240
This is typical.

800
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,840
This is standard, you know?

801
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,340
I'll keep this on me.

802
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,280
Uh oh.

803
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,260
Wait, is that a door?

804
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,280
Wait, where are they?

805
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,460
Oh my god.

806
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,400
Oh my god.

807
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,780
Oh my god.

808
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:12,800
Oh my god.

809
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,320
Oh shoot.

810
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,320
No, no, no.

811
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,280
I'm just a... I'm just a lusty maid.

812
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,020
Please.

813
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,960
Please.

814
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Please.

815
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,780
Oh my gosh.

816
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,780
Where's your lady friend?

817
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,740
Is she gonna come down too?

818
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,340
I'm scared.

819
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,220
Okay.

820
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,360
Whew.

821
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,940
Take this damn route.

822
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,480
Nice.

823
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,120
Yay.

824
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,600
Guys, I was... I'm not being serious.

825
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,280
It's because of the book.

826
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,920
I was trying to be like... Oh, some grapes.

827
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,680
I was trying to... make them be like...

828
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,520
I'm supposed to be here, you know?

829
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,740
Why did they sound like they were coming from over here?

830
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,640
Is this a door?

831
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,720
Oh, it is.

832
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
It's a city aisle.

833
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:58,840
Oh.

834
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,400
Okay.

835
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,100
Hold on.

836
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,580
Before we do that though...

837
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,860
Let's try this... very hard...

838
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh!

839
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,300
I don't need to try it at all.

840
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,740
I have a key.

841
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh!

842
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh yeah.

843
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,640
Take it all.

844
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,180
Take it all.

845
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,050
Remove the top first.

846
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,290
Reach inside and take out all the parts.

847
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,850
Being careful to note their order.

848
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,310
Put the carving onto the rod.

849
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,670
Reinsert the rod into the cavity.

850
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,410
Replace the parts in the order you remove them.

851
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,750
Seal the top with pine tar.

852
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,990
I got his booty!

853
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,010
I be plundering.

854
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,830
Stop!

855
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,570
You viol...

856
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,730
I didn't violate the law, they're pirates!

857
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,730
Whatever you say.

858
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,810
Miss lifts her frills!

859
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,910
Sounds like part two of the book.

860
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,330
What is this?

861
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,990
What is it?

862
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,250
I feel like it's important.

863
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,010
He's peacefully sleeping.

864
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,630
Maybe he has the rest of the book.

865
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,440
This is the other one that's pretty sleazy, right?

866
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,880
The real Bear and Zarya.

867
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,020
Okay.

868
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,720
His drawers...

869
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,420
I think I can leave now.

870
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,120
Maybe he rode it?

871
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,500
Okay.

872
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,880
I...

873
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,920
Was there another...

874
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,660
Way out?

875
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,260
Or...

876
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,460
Oh!

877
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,520
Wait, why don't I go to that one and...

878
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,640
Oh, it's a sword.

879
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,500
Instead of this one.

880
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,580
What's the difference?

881
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,400
Actually, where did I come...

882
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,180
Oh, I came from here.

883
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,520
Okay.

884
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,860
You could have made a stealthy exit.

885
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,940
Yeah, but then I couldn't kill him.

886
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,240
You have the key.

887
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,120
Oh, so true.

888
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,960
Okay, you're right.

889
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,310
Okay.

890
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,550
We're gonna be stealthy.

891
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,290
And leave.

892
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,630
Nobody's gonna spot us.

893
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,630
Is that my horse?

894
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,330
No, my horse is fancy.

895
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:34,850
I remember.

896
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,950
Those...

897
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,230
Poor, stupid pirates up there.

898
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,330
Ew!

899
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,150
What's in here?

900
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,050
That's why you should always search through the trash.

901
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,340
We did it!

902
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
Stupid pirates.

903
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,840
Stupid.

904
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,460
Did you know that I'm your captain now?

905
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,900
They don't even know.

906
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,380
They don't even know.

907
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,540
Oh, I think the other door would have led right there.

908
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,940
Oh, that would have been so bad.

909
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,820
That would have been...

910
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,740
Not ideal.

911
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,200
Medieval dumpster diving.

912
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,920
Yeah.

913
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,660
Where is my horse?

914
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,100
Hmm...

915
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,460
13 is a spooky number.

916
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,760
That's not my horse.

917
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Yeah, I would have been greeted by that guy.

918
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,800
Do you think they know who I am?

919
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,360
Let's see.

920
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,200
Let's see.

921
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,100
They left it by some gate?

922
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,620
Probably.

923
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,790
Wait, they're not talking at all.

924
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,980
Hello?

925
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,940
Am I interrupting?

926
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,580
Are you a pirate?

927
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, where it?

928
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,680
Oh, where is...

929
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:29,860
Where is...

930
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,520
Oh, hey sweet lady of mine?

931
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,220
Oh, hey sweet lady of mine, I'll see you again, yes I'll see you again.

932
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,320
Sweet lady of way rest so fine.

933
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,440
They're still at it.

934
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,820
Oh, hey, sweet lady of my rest.

935
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,540
Oh, hey, sweet lady of mine.

936
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, I'll see you again.

937
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,200
Yes, I'll see you again.

938
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,260
Sweet lady of my rest so fine.

939
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,810
Can you spare a coin?

940
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,530
Oh, my God.

941
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,870
Oh, it's Pewdie!

942
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,770
Red god of courage and honor was he.

943
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,050
Say lo, my Cyrus, say lo.

944
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,610
Colovia is a land of rugged wastes and highland forest.

945
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,350
Why do they speak like that with their hands?

946
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,830
They say syndicates of wizards have led a boycott of imperial goods in the land of the Altma.

947
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,690
It seems Somerset Isle has become a much more dangerous place.

948
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,050
Why do they both talk like that?

949
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,050
Safe travels.

950
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,030
Safe travels.

951
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,350
Oh, hey, sweet lady of my rest.

952
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,470
I like how he sings it.

953
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,510
Sweet lady of mine.

954
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,490
I'll see you again.

955
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,650
I'll also see you again.

956
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,670
Oh, sweet lady of my rest so fine.

957
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,830
Everybody's talking.

958
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,910
I'm getting overwhelmed.

959
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,970
I need to leave.

960
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,250
Everybody's talking.

961
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,070
All right.

962
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,550
So now we just got to go back to our home.

963
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,490
And then I'm going to go to Anvil.

964
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,510
And see how much we need.

965
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,180
The voices.

966
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,320
Puny.

967
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,440
Why would you name your kid that?

968
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,460
Did he just say make your kills be quick?

969
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,820
Wait, am I in the right place?

970
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,340
Yeah.

971
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,560
It's just really orange.

972
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh, I thought he was pantsless for a second.

973
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,620
Just orc things.

974
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah.

975
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,100
Um.

976
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,540
We need to go.

977
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,460
Abandoned.

978
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,840
Abandoned home.

979
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, shoot.

980
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,820
Which one was it?

981
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,940
Stand clear.

982
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,960
What's wrong?

983
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,060
Whose house is this?

984
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,360
Alders.

985
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,540
Is this it?

986
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,820
Is this it?

987
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,380
Um.

988
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,200
Bye.

989
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,500
Be seeing you.

990
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,240
Oh.

991
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,280
Hello.

992
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,320
Hello.

993
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,660
I'm Magician Orateur of the Mages Guild.

994
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,780
I divide my time between the Chadenhall Guild and my own private studies at Willowback.

995
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,960
Learn pickpocketing and you can pants the whole town.

996
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,040
I don't know how to pickpocket.

997
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,640
Not only has necromancy been banned from practice in the Mages Guild, but the guild won't deal with anyone who openly uses it.

998
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,640
Is your tongue okay?

999
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,280
I wanna learn necromancy.

1000
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Farewell.

1001
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,300
Oh, he's looking at me?

1002
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:32,680
Sorry.

1003
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,340
What if I pickpocket that lady?

1004
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,960
Go away.

1005
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,460
Go away, Orateur.

1006
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,400
Okay, here we go.

1007
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,710
I think he will notice.

1008
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,050
You think they'll notice?

1009
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,310
Pickpocket!

1010
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,030
Oops.

1011
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,940
Um.

1012
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,580
I've been suspended from the Mages Guild.

1013
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,970
What does that mean?

1014
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,050
What quest is this?

1015
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,170
Make this my act...

1016
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,110
It's like that lady...

1017
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,430
Oh, hello.

1018
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,930
That lady that was in, like, Italy that would be like...

1019
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,630
Pickpocket!

1020
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,270
Pickpocket!

1021
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,870
Based on your skill and the value of item you try to...

1022
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,170
I don't think he cared very much.

1023
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,230
I think I got the money, you know?

1024
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,630
Pickpocket!

1025
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,030
What's my quest now?

1026
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:47,850
Oh.

1027
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:48,930
Oh.

1028
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,310
Well, what's my quest?

1029
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,050
To go beg for forgiveness?

1030
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,690
Or...

1031
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,610
Did I take the bank key?

1032
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,150
Actually, I don't know which one I took.

1033
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:05,470
Hello.

1034
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,030
You are suspended is the quest.

1035
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,130
A Mages Guild.

1036
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,250
Wait, hold on.

1037
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,530
Which is the Mages Guild.

1038
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,810
I don't have an arrow, so...

1039
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,890
Mages Guild.

1040
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:21,810
Are you?

1041
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,730
Fighters Guild.

1042
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,700
Magrum's House.

1043
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,100
The March Rider.

1044
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,370
An M.

1045
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,110
Lodge.

1046
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,140
I give up.

1047
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,180
Oh.

1048
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,280
Ah!

1049
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,980
You violated the law.

1050
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,620
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.

1051
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,320
Your stolen goods are now forfeited.

1052
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,200
I don't wanna...

1053
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,220
Oh, it's only 25.

1054
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,280
Stop!

1055
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,480
You have violated the law!

1056
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:07,560
Ah!

1057
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,160
I didn't think he was running at me.

1058
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,500
I thought nobody cared.

1059
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,480
You lose any stolen items.

1060
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,380
Wait, what do I have?

1061
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,720
If I resist arrest...

1062
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,620
I could always reload.

1063
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,580
I think it's an autosave, probably.

1064
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,880
You'll die.

1065
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,860
I will...

1066
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,080
Trust.

1067
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,340
Trust!

1068
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,760
Then pay with your blood!

1069
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,920
Just.

1070
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,840
But...

1071
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,120
Who has another bow and arrow?

1072
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,840
Oh, this is on fire.

1073
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,700
I think I should leave.

1074
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,060
Oh,

1075
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,460
they totally... she sees me.

1076
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
You can't hit me.

1077
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,560
Ouch.

1078
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,160
You hit me.

1079
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,620
I'm running.

1080
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,060
Go, you did a go.

1081
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,340
The bell tolls for thee.

1082
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,780
Sorry.

1083
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,880
Oh my gosh.

1084
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,000
Where's my horse?

1085
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,540
You guys stole my horse.

1086
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,340
I think that is even more...

1087
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,840
Okay.

1088
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,680
I think I'm in trouble for real, you guys.

1089
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,300
Last time, it was just one guy.

1090
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:00,840
So...

1091
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,200
I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna load my last...

1092
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,280
Here.

1093
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,340
Um...

1095
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,500
Wait, which is this autosave?

1096
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,880
You think this is when I attack or after I thieved?

1097
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,660
Load.

1098
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,680
Let's see.

1099
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,220
Okay.

1100
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,820
I think we're okay.

1101
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,320
Yeah, I think we're okay.

1102
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,860
Okay.

1103
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,240
Good.

1104
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,620
Good.

1105
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,620
Good.

1106
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,180
Have mercy.

1107
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,020
Just one...

1108
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,760
We're free!

1109
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,320
Wait, is this an entrance?

1110
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,580
Let me in!

1111
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,060
Is that the hero of Kvatch racing down the highway in a white bronco?

1112
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,740
I am the hero of Kvatch.

1113
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,320
I should be... I should be known as such.

1114
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,060
I'm not getting the recognition I deserve.

1115
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,060
You.

1116
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,900
It's all your fault.

1117
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,860
Oh.

1118
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,560
I wasn't going to steal.

1119
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,720
There's a bridge.

1120
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,700
If you're just going to...

1121
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,180
Who sees me?

1122
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,020
Wait, what's that fire over there?

1123
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:06,600
Oh.

1124
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,420
I almost just didn't take my own advice.

1125
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,280
Uh-oh.

1126
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:12,780
Um...

1127
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,960
It's on fire, the city.

1128
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,140
Why can't... Why is it illegal to sit?

1129
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,400
We see you.

1130
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,360
This is why you quicksave before committing crimes.

1131
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,500
Okay, I'm learning.

1132
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,460
Stop!

1133
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,360
You violated the law.

1134
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,260
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.

1135
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:45,340
What is it?

1136
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,040
F7?

1137
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,740
Your stolen goods are now forfeited.

1138
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,050
Thanks for streaming while I pack my separate upcoming trip going to Anime North.

1139
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,310
Ooh, have fun.

1140
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,870
The eye was open.

1141
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,850
It was closed.

1142
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:06,110
F9.

1143
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,730
Oh, okay.

1144
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,570
That's too bad.

1145
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,370
Okay.

1146
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,590
F9.

1147
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,820
I did quicksave, didn't I?

1148
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,100
Oh yeah, I quicksaved right in front of you.

1149
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,720
It's always...

1150
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,560
It's your fault.

1151
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,200
See?

1152
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:26,640
See?

1153
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,500
It's not...

1154
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,880
It's not open.

1155
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,780
So I could grab anything I please.

1156
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,040
Like his...

1157
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,400
Key.

1158
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,420
Flying...

1159
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,360
Flying in the sky...

1160
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,380
Cliff racer flies so high...

1161
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,500
Flying...

1162
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:11,290
What's wrong with him?

1163
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,970
I used the key door.

1164
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,690
Oh, he's drunk.

1165
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,430
Stupid.

1166
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:25,950
I'm trespassing.

1167
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,850
Technically.

1168
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,030
But...

1169
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,150
I have a key.

1170
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,450
So that means...

1171
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,310
I must belong here.

1172
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:35,770
Clearly.

1173
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,590
I don't think there's anybody...

1174
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,890
Wow, this place is...

1175
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,490
Well!

1176
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,870
They just keep their meat on the table.

1177
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,630
Next to the strawberries.

1178
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,110
Where's all their gold?

1179
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,090
One measly gold.

1180
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,290
Incident and necrom.

1181
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,690
Ooh!

1182
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,210
Artista!

1183
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,790
Boar meat.

1184
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,770
No!

1185
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,560
Why doesn't anybody cook their meat in this game?

1186
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,480
I hope the guy doesn't come home.

1187
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,400
That would be really unfortunate.

1188
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,280
Mage's Guild Char...

1189
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,080
Oh yeah, this guy is part of the Mage's Guild.

1190
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,640
That doesn't matter.

1191
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,560
Unless I get caught.

1192
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,740
Basement.

1193
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,790
I still got it, baby.

1194
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,090
Nyo-kun, thank you for your funds.

1195
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,850
I love your profile picture.

1196
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,110
Hope things get better for you.

1197
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,560
Why doesn't anyone keep...

1198
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,540
Big gold?

1199
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,000
At all?

1200
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,720
So disappointing, all these...

1201
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,040
Richie rich folks.

1202
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,100
With no riches.

1203
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,420
Miu cute.

1204
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,280
Yeah.

1205
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,920
I prefer Saki, but I respect your opinion.

1206
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,300
Because Miu is my second...

1207
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,940
Well...

1208
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,220
Oh my gosh, what's her name?

1209
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,600
Glasses Girl in...

1210
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,120
Sorry, I'm talking Blue Archive, you guys.

1211
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,340
There's a Glasses Girl in...

1212
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,720
Um...

1213
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,060
In...

1214
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,420
The Bunny Squad.

1215
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,420
Oh boy!

1216
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1217
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,120
She was...

1218
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,440
I didn't like her so much.

1219
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,240
Oh wait, is this...

1220
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,640
No.

1221
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,400
I'm still trying to find her...

1222
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,960
Our home.

1223
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,180
I didn't like her so much until she got the...

1224
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,340
Bathing suit outfit.

1225
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,480
And then I was like, okay.

1226
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,700
I think it's because her initial art was just kind of like...

1227
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,260
Something's off about it to me.

1228
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,480
How can I help you today, friend?

1229
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,800
But then I saw her...

1230
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,680
With the bathing suit art.

1231
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,260
And I was like, she's so cute.

1232
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,820
Swear a coin for the infound.

1233
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,320
Hail.

1234
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:11,880
Hello.

1235
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,260
What?

1236
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,400
Everybody's gotta have...

1237
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,200
To say something.

1238
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,540
It's like those scenes in anime where...

1239
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,710
Something happens and each person goes...

1240
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,910
And they like change the...

1241
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,860
To each person.

1242
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,680
You know what I mean?

1243
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,000
Okay.

1244
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,040
Let's just go to the quests and figure it out.

1245
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,340
Which one was it?

1246
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:43,930
Killing field?

1247
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:44,770
No.

1248
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,790
Oh, a watery grave.

1249
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,190
There we go.

1250
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:47,550
Inspect.

1251
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,410
Open a map.

1252
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,750
I'm like too...

1253
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,510
Oh, it's right there.

1254
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:55,770
Okay.

1255
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:56,870
I'm right in front of it.

1256
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,580
I see.

1257
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,520
What are you watching?

1258
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,240
You know those scenes in anime.

1259
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,680
Something will happen.

1260
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,700
Like something dramatic.

1261
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,980
And then it'll like...

1262
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,620
Each character when it zooms in on their face.

1263
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,260
They'll go like...

1264
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,260
Each time.

1265
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,060
You'll notice it now that I've mentioned it.

1266
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,260
You'll know.

1267
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,680
They do that all the time.

1268
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,200
It's a staple.

1269
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,840
It is.

1270
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,320
What are you talking about?

1271
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,100
It's real.

1272
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,660
It's real.

1273
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,220
I promise.

1274
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:46,720
Okay.

1275
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,080
Make a bet, everybody.

1276
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,500
Will he have hair?

1277
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,200
Excuse me, brother.

1278
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,220
Can you spare a moment?

1279
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,900
Will he wear wigs?

1280
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,400
What is it?

1281
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,200
Aw, man.

1282
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
So, is it true about your latest contract?

1283
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,120
The girl's nanny was actually a fighter's guild bodyguard?

1284
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,640
Word certainly gets around fast, doesn't it?

1285
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,980
Kyle, I think you're in the wrong place.

1286
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,480
Antraneta has been running her mouth off again.

1287
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,580
Anyway, nothing I couldn't handle.

1288
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,840
Sometimes I wonder how you survive it all without me being there to watch your back.

1289
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,220
Well, I should return to my duties.

1290
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,140
Till next time, then.

1291
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,300
Walk always in the shadow of Sittis.

1292
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,600
Why do they do this?

1293
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,540
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary, my newest sister.

1294
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,940
Oh, okay, hold on.

1295
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:30,940
Nice.

1296
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,400
I don't play Blue Archive anymore, but my fave was Shiroko.

1297
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,280
Shiroko, I love so much because she's voiced by my seiyuuoshi.

1298
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,640
Hello, my sister.

1299
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,120
Hello, my brother.

1300
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,360
Brother.

1301
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,740
So, the pirate has been eliminated.

1302
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,200
I hate his hair.

1303
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,080
I hate it.

1304
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,540
No one will mourn his passing.

1305
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,880
And Sittis has been appeased.

1306
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,040
Please accept this black band as your reward.

1307
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,880
It is a ring whose powers are quite useful to those who value discretion.

1308
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,840
Cool.

1309
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:02,960
Woo!

1310
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,460
What did I get?

1311
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,040
I've been meaning to speak with you.

1312
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,180
But of course, what trouble?

1313
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,320
Oh, black band.

1314
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Wait, what is it?

1315
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,760
Is it like a ring?

1316
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,800
Oh, it looks like a ring.

1317
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,100
I can put on multiple rings.

1318
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,640
I'm styling.

1319
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,560
Nice.

1320
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,820
I've been meaning to ask you about your last contract.

1321
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,900
I heard there were some complications.

1322
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,040
What's happening?

1323
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,600
Wait, what's going on?

1324
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
It certainly gets around fast, doesn't it?

1325
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,560
Whoa!

1326
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,360
Don't tell me.

1327
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,080
Antoinette has been running her mouth off again.

1328
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,400
Whoa!

1329
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,920
Anyway, nothing I could unhandle.

1330
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,560
You are truly an asset to this sanctuary.

1331
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,520
I'm buffed.

1332
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,040
Here's hoping all of our contracts work out that well.

1333
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,480
Well, I should return to my duties.

1334
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,420
Till next time, then.

1335
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,740
Walk with darkness, child of the night mother.

1336
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,580
Hello, my sister.

1337
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,140
Oh, what just happened?

1338
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,420
Are you okay?

1339
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,180
I think you got...

1340
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,880
I think you were collateral damage there.

1341
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,480
Get away from me.

1342
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,060
Oh, sorry.

1343
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,140
RTX wisp.

1344
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:18,880
Yeah.

1345
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,000
Yeah, actually.

1346
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,260
Wait, is this guy gonna follow me all the time now?

1347
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,600
That's so cute.

1348
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,100
Woohoo!

1349
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,140
Okay, wait.

1350
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,700
Can I get a new quest?

1351
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:32,840
Or...

1352
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,540
Guys, I really wanna kill those people.

1353
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,570
I still wanna kill the paranoia people.

1354
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,350
But I don't think I'm strong enough anymore.

1355
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,730
I don't think I'm strong enough.

1356
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,700
Clippers, please.

1357
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,140
What?

1358
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,800
What did I say?

1359
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,280
Uh-oh.

1360
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,140
What did I say?

1361
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:07,920
Oh, hello.

1362
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,480
Oh, Chiva.

1363
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,400
I remember you.

1364
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:17,810
Try poison.

1365
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:18,610
Oh, yes.

1366
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:19,710
Yes.

1367
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,230
We can try...

1368
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,150
We can try, like, better...

1369
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,110
Wait, I'm trying to look for...

1370
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:26,530
Vampire Man.

1371
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,390
Is that you?

1372
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,070
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary.

1373
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:33,750
Thank you.

1374
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,410
My newest sister.

1375
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,710
My newest sister.

1376
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:38,070
Uh...

1377
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,310
Someone here should sell some.

1378
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:40,710
Okay.

1379
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,630
Yeah, if we try poison arrows, it might be okay.

1380
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:48,910
Did you?

1381
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:52,070
No, that guy uses his fists.

1382
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,910
That guy is not relying on...

1383
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:56,410
Arrows.

1384
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,190
That guy uses brute strength.

1385
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,550
Let's see.

1386
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:11,290
Where'd he go?

1387
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,230
I think he hangs out down here.

1388
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:14,450
No?

1389
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,930
I can't believe he sleeps on a slab.

1390
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,140
Look at the following.

1391
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,500
Well, people will think I'm possessed or...

1392
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,900
Oh, gosh.

1393
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,080
Oh, he's here.

1394
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,180
Hello, my sister.

1395
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,660
Hello.

1396
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,920
I'm glad you've returned.

1397
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,860
The contract is waiting, if you're ready.

1398
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:46,400
Okay.

1399
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,120
Contract.

1400
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,120
What we got?

1401
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,560
We need you to stage an accident.

1402
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,580
Kill the target in the mana specified, and you'll receive a considerable bonus.

1403
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,060
Ooh.

1404
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,860
Do you accept this contract?

1405
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,200
Um, yes.

1406
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,340
As I expected.

1407
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,400
Good.

1408
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,620
The target is a wood elf named Banelin.

1409
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,120
You will find him at his home in Bruma.

1410
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,040
Enter secretly and avoid his manservant, Grom.

1411
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,100
On the second floor is a secret door leading to a crawl space.

1412
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,400
Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Banelin's favorite chair.

1413
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,140
Loosen those fastenings any night between 8 p.m.

1414
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,140
and 11 p.m., and the head will surely fall on Banelin as he relaxes in his chair, as is his custom.

1415
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,060
Wait, what do you mean?

1416
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,500
If Banelin is eliminated in any other manner, or if the manservant bomb is killed, you will forfeit the bonus.

1417
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,060
Now go, and may Scythus be with you.

1418
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:43,520
Oh, wait.

1419
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,320
What'd you say?

1420
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,160
Sorry, I was...

1421
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,420
Excuse me, brother.

1422
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,360
I was too concerned with your hair.

1423
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:51,540
She's so cool.

1424
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,960
Wait, hold on.

1425
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,220
Okay, I gotta read this again.

1426
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,840
Stage a tragic accident.

1427
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,400
Oh, shoot.

1428
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,580
It's not telling me anything.

1429
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,700
I...

1430
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,500
Okay, so I can't kill Grom.

1431
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,460
How am I supposed to kill him?

1432
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:11,920
Okay.

1433
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,160
Oh, you must mean the orphanage contract.

1434
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,420
Uh-oh.

1435
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,760
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary.

1436
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,660
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1437
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,280
My newest sister.

1438
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,200
Thank you.

1439
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,300
Oh, I can't go out the key.

1440
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:25,940
Yeah, that's right.

1441
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,720
Ask again?

1442
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:30,480
Okay.

1443
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1444
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,160
Luckily, I have lots of stealth.

1445
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,640
Yeah, yeah, through the holes.

1446
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,940
Hello, my sister.

1447
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,700
Brother, if I may have a word.

1448
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,760
Yes, brother.

1449
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,540
I've been meaning to ask you about...

1450
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,360
Every moment that Bainlin draws breath is an affront to Scythus and the Night Mother.

1451
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,540
Fulfill the contract and honor the Brotherhood as you should.

1452
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,820
We saw it flickering.

1453
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:04,980
Okay.

1454
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,580
You are to travel to Bruma.

1455
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:07,880
Oh.

1456
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,320
Into the house of the Wood Elf Bainlin.

1457
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,280
Wait, wait, I have to pay attention.

1458
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,220
I have to pay attention.

1459
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,340
It should look like an accident.

1460
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,740
I'm sure you can handle it.

1461
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,580
Wait.

1462
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,040
He didn't explain anymore.

1463
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,500
Make it look like an accident.

1464
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,740
Surely.

1465
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:28,780
Farewell, sister.

1466
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,140
Surely they will.

1467
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,360
They will.

1468
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,480
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary.

1469
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,460
I welcome you to our family.

1470
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,600
And this sanctuary.

1471
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,000
To others?

1472
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:42,720
Oh, okay, okay.

1473
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,380
May you find yourself at home here.

1474
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,880
In the loving embrace of our lady, the Night Mother.

1475
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,700
What if we plant a...

1476
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,120
A...

1477
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,240
Um...

1478
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,280
A bow and arrow in her arm?

1479
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't know.

1480
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:02,600
If the target is old and weak, as you say, then his manservant is sure to be quite the opposite.

1481
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,020
Oh.

1482
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,600
Best stay out of his way.

1483
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,020
Dude's quantum hair.

1484
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,220
May Scythus be with you.

1485
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,600
Yeah, that's true.

1486
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,760
How could I make it look like an accident?

1487
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,100
Mentioned a crawlspace.

1488
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:15,760
Yes, he did.

1489
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,180
He said on the second story.

1490
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,900
Help me.

1491
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,280
Yes, sister.

1492
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,700
What can old Gogron do for you?

1493
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,720
Gogron, give me some advice.

1494
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,040
The manservant's name is Grom, you say.

1495
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,680
Sounds like a Nord.

1496
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,280
Probably a big one.

1497
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,280
If he catches you, get ready for a serious fight.

1498
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,240
Yeah.

1499
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:37,400
Yeah.

1500
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:37,780
Later then.

1501
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,340
Mm-hmm.

1502
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,920
Is she still...

1503
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,820
Greetings, sister.

1504
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,540
I do hope you are well.

1505
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,780
Otiva, help me.

1506
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:02,280
If things go badly, forgo the plan and simply kill the mark any way you can.

1507
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,960
You'll lose the bonus.

1508
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,560
But at least the contract will be fulfilled.

1509
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,300
Ah, okay.

1510
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,980
She's like, just murder.

1511
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,300
Go now, dear family member, and may the night mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace.

1512
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,140
Thank you.

1513
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,800
Is this little guy gonna get in the way of my stealth?

1514
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,520
My little ghost pal?

1515
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,920
Wise otiva.

1516
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,540
Yes.

1517
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:27,880
It will!

1518
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,580
Welcome dear sister, so good to finally meet you.

1519
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,120
Oh my gosh.

1520
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,640
I hope you're getting along all right.

1521
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,840
If you need anything, anything at all, you need only ask.

1522
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,000
Yes, it's a bright light.

1523
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:39,480
Shoot.

1524
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,280
How do you plan on entering this man's house?

1525
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,660
Through the front door?

1526
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,960
Be smart and look for a more inconspicuous way in.

1527
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,600
Like a cellar entrance.

1528
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,360
She's got crazy eyes.

1529
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,340
I'll be seeing you then.

1530
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,280
Wow, she's...

1531
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:53,920
Oh my gosh.

1532
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,380
Get out of the way.

1533
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:56,860
Can I?

1534
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,460
You again?

1535
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,100
I thought I'd made it clear.

1536
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,280
They're like, bad codec.

1537
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,500
If you're here to buy or sell something, get on with it already.

1538
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,440
Oh, I can buy from you.

1539
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:06,960
That's right.

1540
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:08,880
Um...

1541
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,780
I see this I don't have all day.

1542
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,600
Hurry up.

1543
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,160
Do you have any poison arrows?

1544
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,620
Steel arrows.

1545
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,940
Arrow of cowardice.

1546
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:21,600
No.

1547
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,600
Bow of infernal frost.

1548
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:27,960
Neat.

1549
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,960
I can fix her.

1550
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,460
Foul smelling ape.

1551
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,540
Excuse me, brother.

1552
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,320
Can you spare a moment?

1553
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,380
Yes, brother.

1554
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,980
I've been meaning to ask you about your last contract.

1555
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,360
I heard there was some complication.

1556
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
I can't believe...

1557
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,740
World certainly gets around fast, doesn't it?

1558
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,200
I can't believe he's bald again.

1559
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,140
Alrighty.

1560
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,360
Okay.

1561
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,740
Let's go try this contract, I guess.

1562
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,180
I think they're in the city, so we don't have to go so far.

1563
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,340
Make sure to get the bonus.

1564
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:15,900
I'll try.

1565
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,580
I would like to get the bonus, yes.

1566
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:26,850
Let's...

1567
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:27,290
Oh, yeah.

1568
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:28,790
Let's take off my ring.

1569
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:36,850
And then it's...

1570
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,950
Black water-sized stables.

1571
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,590
If that guy can do it, so can I.

1572
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:56,070
It's not illegal to go in the water, is it?

1573
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,810
How goes it?

1574
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:57,450
Hello.

1575
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,150
Is this a fighter's guild?

1576
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,030
The stables.

1577
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:05,650
How are you?

1578
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,790
Outside?

1579
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,600
Okay.

1580
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,660
Austin, Nadia.

1581
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,680
Thank you so much for the Valkryptor.

1582
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,220
Thank you.

1583
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:17,780
All right.

1584
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,060
It's in another city.

1585
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,140
Oh, it is?

1586
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,920
No kidding.

1587
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,480
Reading the number helps.

1588
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,400
Um, the number said 60 steps.

1589
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,700
What are you talking about?

1590
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:33,420
Huh?

1591
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,820
It 100% said 60 steps.

1592
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,400
Well.

1593
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,520
Hmm.

1594
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,730
Where is it then?

1595
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,690
60 to get out of the city.

1596
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,010
Yeah.

1597
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,890
Yeah, I discovered that now.

1598
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,930
What's awaited quests.

1599
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:00,910
City of Bruma.

1600
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,670
Bruma.

1601
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:05,910
Oh, my bad.

1602
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:07,550
Bruma.

1603
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,880
Bruma.

1604
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,400
Bruma.

1605
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,420
Oh, there it is.

1606
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,200
I was like...

1607
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,460
Isn't there supposed to be an arrow?

1608
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,140
So if I travel to the stables, maybe my horse will join.

1609
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,860
Thank you for the soup?

1610
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,020
You're welcome.

1611
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,540
Okay, it's 3 a.m.

1612
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,260
Perfect time.

1613
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,800
Probably they go into this guy's house and murder him.

1614
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,790
What if I do want to enter through the front door?

1615
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,370
All right.

1616
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,290
I save.

1617
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,260
I think that was the sound of my pickpocketing level up.

1618
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:19,640
Oops.

1619
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,900
Okay, time to sneak.

1620
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,740
I have entered Bane Lin's house.

1621
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,500
If I can access the second floor crawl space and loosen the fastenings on the mounted head between 8 p.m.

1622
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,260
and 11 p.m.

1623
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,960
It will fall on Bane Lin as he rests in his chair.

1624
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,780
Do I need to come back?

1625
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:49,940
Wait.

1626
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:52,960
Oh.

1627
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,440
Wait, so I have to be there at 8 to 11?

1628
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,420
Where's the door?

1629
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,300
You can just wait on the second floor.

1630
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,020
But like that...

1631
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,660
I think I might get caught, no?

1632
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,740
Hide in the crawl space.

1633
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,900
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1634
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,980
I quick save.

1635
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,040
Oh, I saved.

1636
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,300
So if we die here, we'll be right outside.

1637
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:45,720
It's okay.

1638
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:02,230
Okay.

1639
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,110
Either...

1640
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,150
Okay, Grom is asleep.

1641
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,630
Okay, actually, this is perfect.

1642
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:09,910
No?

1643
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,370
They're both asleep.

1644
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,570
They're both asleep.

1645
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,090
Now, where was the crawl space?

1646
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:18,270
Nice.

1647
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,370
And also, what?

1648
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:24,610
This one, maybe?

1649
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,090
Um...

1650
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,970
In Grom's room.

1651
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,920
Close the door?

1652
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,860
Uh-huh.

1653
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,800
Uh-huh.

1654
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,120
Okay.

1655
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,440
All right.

1656
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,060
Okay, nice.

1657
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,420
Totally fine that we're here.

1658
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,580
Now, we wait...

1659
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:03,980
Okay.

1660
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,220
It's 5 a.m.

1661
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:06,840
6...

1662
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,060
Wait.

1663
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,140
Oh, wait.

1664
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:16,360
This will be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

1665
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:16,940
Wait.

1666
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,910
Wait.

1667
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,710
8...

1668
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,650
10...

1669
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:23,850
Wait.

1670
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:24,750
Oh.

1671
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,490
Wait.

1672
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:32,290
Wait.

1673
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,450
You need 20.

1674
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,990
Well, 20 o'clock is 8 o'clock.

1675
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,630
But that's starting from 12, no?

1676
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,530
I didn't start from 12.

1677
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:44,570
I started from 5.

1678
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,460
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1679
01:12:50,020 --> 01:13:09,660
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1680
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:14,440
Okay.

1681
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,860
So, it was...

1682
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,340
8 to 11.

1683
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,520
So, this should be fine.

1684
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,920
We're waiting all day and waiting all night.

1685
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,380
Waiting to murder.

1686
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,920
Okay, we just wait a couple minutes.

1687
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,730
8-0-1.

1688
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:57,730
Activate.

1689
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:02,570
These appear to be the fastenings of the mounted minotaur head.

1690
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,310
As expected, they have been loosened over time.

1691
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:11,010
You could easily remove the fastenings causing the mounted head to crash in the floor below.

1692
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,790
Do you wish to remove the fastenings?

1693
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:15,650
Yes.

1694
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,840
The mounted head has fallen on Bain Lin, killing him as expected.

1695
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:34,440
I must return to the sanctuary and speak with Vincent Baltieri to receive my reward.

1696
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,460
Nice.

1697
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,480
Good job, team.

1698
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,760
Wait, so, uh...

1699
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,200
Question.

1700
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,880
Can I fast travel from here or do I have to leave?

1701
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:49,480
Tsundurathos.

1702
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,440
Thank you so much for the 20th gift.

1703
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:50,980
Thank you!

1704
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,550
Gotta sneak out.

1705
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:57,850
Wait, we can try?

1706
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:58,510
Let's see.

1707
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,390
You cannot fast travel from this location.

1708
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:03,070
Okay.

1709
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,690
All right, well, I just saved, so...

1710
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,860
Surely he's gonna be all, like...

1711
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,990
Concerned with this...

1712
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,070
Oh.

1713
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,380
Uh-oh.

1714
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,460
He's totally gonna see me.

1715
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,200
You guys are already saved.

1716
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,830
Oh, my sneak increased.

1717
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,250
Actually, perfect timing.

1718
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:51,610
Okay.

1719
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:03,930
Okay.

1720
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:04,250
Ikimasu!

1721
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,190
The eyeball opened for a tad second.

1722
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,070
Where's the door?

1723
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,550
Get me out of here!

1724
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:21,050
Yeah!

1725
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,790
I am the Brotherhood's best...

1726
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,790
Bestest.

1727
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,410
Sithis loves me the mostest.

1728
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:28,990
How are you?

1729
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,810
Oh, I just killed the guy in there.

1730
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:31,530
What?

1731
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:33,430
Oh.

1732
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,510
You gotta make up your mind.

1733
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,250
Hi there.

1734
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:37,970
Hello.

1735
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,880
Let's go home.

1736
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,900
And then after this one, I'm gonna go to Anvil.

1737
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,640
And we're gonna see...

1738
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,360
Maybe after this, I will have enough money.

1739
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,260
We'll see.

1740
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,840
We'll see, we'll see.

1741
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,840
But after this, we'll...

1742
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,620
Um, go to Anvil and see if I can...

1743
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,300
Buy a house.

1744
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,820
Tell everybody of your work.

1745
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,940
I'm quite proud of it, so...

1746
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,620
I think everybody should...

1747
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,280
Be proud of their work, no?

1748
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:20,570
I have a feeling I'm going the wrong way.

1749
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,450
That was really smooth.

1750
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,210
Thank you!

1751
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,410
It's like I was born...

1752
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:31,450
To be...

1753
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,610
To be like this.

1754
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:36,630
I was born to be evil.

1755
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:40,410
Um...

1756
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,370
Greetings to you.

1757
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,910
Greetings to you.

1758
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:43,090
Cool.

1759
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:48,990
Evil.

1760
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:50,870
Evil.

1761
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:52,970
All right.

1762
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:53,950
Let's go, guys.

1763
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,930
Good stuff.

1764
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,990
Born to live in the walls.

1765
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,550
Call me.

1766
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,270
Who lives in the walls?

1767
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,390
Excuse me, brother.

1768
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,790
Can you spare a...

1769
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,690
Hello, top of the morning.

1770
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:16,110
How are you?

1771
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,890
Great, Mr. Guard.

1772
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:17,910
I just murdered a guy.

1773
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,730
I didn't even ask you about the last contract.

1774
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:20,670
Oh, greeting.

1775
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:21,830
Termites.

1776
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,110
Call me.

1777
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,010
Mintomite.

1778
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,450
Well, it's true.

1779
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:30,150
The children actually tried to defend themselves.

1780
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,290
Poor dears.

1781
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,310
Wait, I thought the other guy had the contract.

1782
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,510
So, the accident has been staged and Banelin lies dead.

1783
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,930
Well done.

1784
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,910
You have more than earned your reward and bonus.

1785
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,230
I present to you this dagger.

1786
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:49,510
It's an enchanted blade known as Suffathorn.

1787
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,570
Its prick is deadly, I assure you.

1788
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,330
Yes, you are quite an asset to this sanctuary.

1789
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:58,190
In fact, I believe you are ready for advancement.

1790
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,070
Oh God, what's happening?

1791
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,970
I hereby appoint you slayer.

1792
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:01,710
Big boss.

1793
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:02,170
Well done.

1794
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:04,150
I'm the doom slayer.

1795
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:04,730
Now go, sound of Sithis.

1796
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,910
Go and rest.

1797
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,110
You'll need it.

1798
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,050
Thank you.

1799
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,590
Hail, my sister.

1800
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,050
I'm a slayer.

1801
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:12,230
I've been meaning to speak with you.

1802
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,330
I'm the doom slayer.

1803
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,990
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1804
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,970
I want to play the new doom so bad.

1805
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:20,050
I want to play the new doom so bad.

1806
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,290
It looks so fun.

1807
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,290
Have you played it yet?

1808
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:32,210
It's funny because my two moods right now are fantasy life and doom.

1809
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,390
It's awesome.

1810
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:40,470
Waiting on a sail.

1811
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:42,370
I think I'll wait for it to go on sail too.

1812
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:43,090
I'm not gonna lie.

1813
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,150
I might wait for it to go on sail too.

1814
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,530
But it looks so fun.

1815
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,150
My PC can't run it.

1816
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,110
Oh, but your PC could run fantasy life.

1817
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:03,350
And it's not the same, but it's pretty darn great.

1818
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,030
It's free on game pass.

1819
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,230
No kidding.

1820
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:21,780
I love how we say that free on game pass when game pass is literally paid.

1821
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,040
I must accept a contract.

1822
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:24,940
No, no, no, no.

1823
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:34,080
We're going to go to Anvil, but I kind of want to travel the roads, but it's like the furthest.

1824
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,940
So it will travel from Kvatch, you know?

1825
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,920
We'll travel from Kvatch since it's our first time.

1826
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,360
First time in Japan, finally playing MGS.

1827
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,380
What a great establishing cuts in.

1828
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,700
For real, while watching sneaky ghost stealth in a closet.

1829
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,500
Welcome to Japan.

1830
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,380
Welcome, welcome.

1831
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,320
I think it's this pathway up here.

1832
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,220
Freemium.

1833
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1834
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,040
We're like, it's free on blank, but blank requires a subscription.

1835
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:20,840
Not that I am, I, I do appreciate game pass quite a bit though, because Sometimes I'm not sure what to play.

1836
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,460
And I'll just see what's, what's available on it, you know?

1837
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,060
It's free with a star.

1838
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1839
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,300
Okay, we're going the right way.

1840
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,800
We're going to lag a little bit since we're entering new territory.

1841
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,700
Is that a guard?

1842
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,940
Or a bandit?

1843
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,440
Oops.

1844
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,340
Damn, I got his toes.

1845
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,500
I think that's a bandit.

1846
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,320
Oh, come on.

1847
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,500
Bandit Bowman.

1848
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,010
Wow, he's got a lot of steel arrows.

1849
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,050
Let's go.

1850
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,990
Can I take that one back or...

1851
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,330
Wait, how do you pick people up again?

1852
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:32,270
Oh...

1853
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:33,690
Uh...

1854
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,970
Bro just stood there and took it.

1855
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,310
Yeah.

1856
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:38,570
Hold E.

1857
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,790
Oh, that's...

1858
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,170
There we go.

1859
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:41,890
Okay.

1860
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:42,930
Move your body.

1861
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:43,930
No, no.

1862
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:45,330
It's like...

1863
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:46,750
Oh, come on.

1864
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:56,150
So I did hit that!

1865
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,310
I did hit him!

1866
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,850
I think it just didn't register.

1867
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,410
Lame.

1868
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:04,250
Oh, no!

1869
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,630
There's an oblivion portal here, too!

1870
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:11,770
Okay, let's get my bow and arrow out just in case.

1871
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:12,810
I'm gonna sneak.

1872
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,210
Just in case there's some...

1873
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:16,690
Freakish dudes around.

1874
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:17,930
I mean, this is pretty fre...

1875
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,090
This is pretty freakish.

1876
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:21,230
I noticed this...

1877
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:21,810
Oh, the bandit!

1878
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:22,550
What were you doing?

1879
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,080
Hmm.

1880
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,260
Go be another hero.

1881
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,620
After I get my house, maybe we will do oblivion portal again.

1882
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,320
Gottshaw Inn.

1883
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,140
Maybe we will do another portal.

1884
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:52,070
Where is my horse?

1885
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,960
I'll never know.

1886
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,000
Portals are optional, but they have good loot.

1887
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,480
Oh.

1888
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:07,140
Hello?

1889
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,360
Imperial Legion soldier?

1890
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:10,880
Hello.

1891
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:12,480
Hi!

1892
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,160
Hi!

1893
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,880
Did you know that there's a portal, like, right out there?

1894
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,580
What do you need?

1895
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,860
I'm asking you.

1896
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:17,520
Do you know?

1897
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,060
Gray Fox.

1898
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:19,980
That's my boss.

1899
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:20,900
Carry on.

1900
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,980
Oblivion portal in Elder Scrolls Oblivion?

1901
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,700
Bravo Kojima!

1902
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,060
He does it again.

1903
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:32,300
In order to pick people up first, you gotta have some riz.

1904
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,180
I think I have...

1905
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:35,700
Riz.

1906
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,000
Oh, this is about the...

1907
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,220
Yeah, he was assassinated.

1908
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:42,820
Yeah.

1909
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,140
How do you do?

1910
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,200
Is this...

1911
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,600
Is this where you sleep?

1912
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,540
No, sir.

1913
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,870
It's not saying that I can't go into these rooms.

1914
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:59,390
It's just saying that it's hard to.

1915
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:01,730
I think...

1916
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:04,730
I think I could probably do it.

1917
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,150
I've got the riz.

1918
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:09,670
I've got the riz.

1919
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,810
I've got the riz.

1920
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,610
I've got the riz.

1921
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:20,010
Guys, we must continue onward to Anvil.

1922
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:20,990
We're on a journey.

1923
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,670
Why is it Kvatch...

1924
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,190
Oh, I thought that was an imp.

1925
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:27,790
Oh my gosh.

1926
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,710
Why is it Kvatch the third?

1927
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,730
No, I don't want to fast travel.

1928
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:38,670
Imagine being a thief who can't pickpocket.

1929
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,370
Surely you're not talking about me.

1930
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,690
Some scratch mark.

1931
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:52,990
Is it supposed to be...

1932
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,610
Wow, it's so dusty in here.

1933
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:55,950
It's supposed to...

1934
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,270
Is it...

1935
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:00,510
Is it supposed to be like a...

1936
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,190
They got...

1937
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,190
They got...

1938
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,270
Burnt down, so...

1939
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:07,830
What was that?

1940
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,390
What's that?

1941
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:16,850
Nothing?

1942
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,610
Does he got gold?

1943
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:20,270
No.

1944
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,980
I am talking about you and don't call me Charlie.

1945
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,860
I pickpocketed that guy.

1946
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:30,920
What are you talking about?

1947
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,160
Am I getting attacked or something?

1948
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,360
I hear like something...

1949
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,300
Sounds like...

1950
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh.

1951
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,280
No.

1952
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,360
Sounds like something's like blowing fire at me.

1953
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:43,780
Oh.

1954
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,360
Hmm.

1955
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,030
Must have been the wind, yeah.

1956
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,130
Okay.

1957
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,270
You are guards.

1958
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,950
You know, I once had a horse like that.

1959
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:01,050
Oh ho.

1960
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,650
Why did you take down the horse too?

1961
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:09,930
Oh, maybe they took down the scamp.

1962
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:10,810
Oh, he's empty.

1963
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:14,650
You're...

1964
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,150
They took down your horse?

1965
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:19,630
Look at him.

1966
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:20,250
He...

1967
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,650
He wants to end it all.

1968
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,110
He misses his horse so much.

1969
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,650
It's my birthday today.

1970
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,050
May I have a minto birthday song?

1971
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:30,070
Ho ho.

1972
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:30,670
I'm sorry.

1973
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,110
I can't sing right now.

1974
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,150
Actually, especially today.

1975
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,350
I think my voice is too bad.

1976
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,570
Wait, there's a second portal.

1977
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,370
Wait, hold on.

1978
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:43,350
No.

1979
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,010
I'm so sorry.

1980
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,490
I want to sing for you.

1981
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:50,130
Happy birthday though.

1982
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:51,830
Happy, happy birthday.

1983
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:57,690
Happy birthday.

1984
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:03,090
Portals everywhere, yeah.

1985
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:04,790
Is that anvil?

1986
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,350
Oh, sure.

1987
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:07,010
Looks like it.

1988
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,590
I wish I could mark where the portals are.

1989
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,530
This is so sad.

1990
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,770
This must be what I was hearing.

1991
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,330
Are you okay?

1992
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,610
Ma'am?

1993
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:19,730
Ma 'am?

1994
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,310
You got any rumors?

1995
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:24,570
The Kvatch Oblivion Gate has been closed.

1996
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,490
Don't you understand what that means?

1997
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,490
We can beat the bastards.

1998
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:30,610
Oh, you can get close to a market.

1999
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:32,150
Carry on.

2000
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:36,330
Help, there's no other s...

2001
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:37,030
Dang it.

2002
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:39,250
Dang it.

2003
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,180
I killed him.

2004
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:46,700
Oh.

2005
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,300
There's three of them?

2006
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:51,820
Three more?

2007
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:53,940
Oh, shoot.

2008
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,900
You saw me?

2009
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:57,080
So much for being stealthy.

2010
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:57,760
Where is he?

2011
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,240
Oh, shoot.

2012
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:11,210
The twang of the bow and scraping of arrow fletchings are quite familiar to you.

2013
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:16,730
As a new journeyman marksman, you can now focus your vision to aim more precisely by holding...

2014
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:18,590
Right click?

2015
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,820
Wait, where?

2016
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,260
Wait, where'd the other guys go?

2017
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:31,130
Shoot.

2018
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:33,410
Oh!

2019
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,730
Oh my gosh!

2020
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:39,290
Wait, oh.

2021
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:40,110
I have to aim?

2022
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,030
Damn it.

2023
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:47,330
That killed him though?

2024
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,090
I think that should be all of them.

2025
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:53,410
They're rolling.

2026
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:54,850
They're rolling.

2027
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:58,730
And hands.

2028
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:00,910
Sorry, I mean, I hope your voice gets on soon.

2029
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,630
This will be my birthday wish.

2030
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:03,350
Thank you!

2031
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:07,530
I will sing you a happy birthday.

2032
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,170
Another day.

2033
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:11,550
Promise.

2034
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:13,330
Even if it's delayed.

2035
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,350
I'll sing you a happy birthday.

2036
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:17,330
Okay.

2037
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:18,290
Oh, my eyes.

2038
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:24,150
Get my arrows back.

2039
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,770
That one probably was eaten by the rocks.

2040
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,090
Let's go to the other one and mark it too.

2041
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh, wait!

2042
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:42,890
If I sleep...

2043
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:45,540
I can...

2044
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,300
get the upgrade.

2045
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,340
Nice.

2046
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,440
Let's sleep.

2047
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:50,920
Let's sleep.

2048
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,540
Wow, it's so...

2049
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,700
Okay, we get it.

2050
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,460
You're a portal.

2051
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,300
Oh my god.

2052
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:56,460
So much thunder.

2053
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,000
We got the level up, baby.

2054
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,840
Okay, so there's another portal over here.

2055
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,620
I can now zoom.

2056
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,260
This is huge!

2057
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,990
I don't see no scamps.

2058
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:27,050
I guess I was like so concerned about the sounds before.

2059
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:30,250
Itina has learned the power of leading forward.

2060
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:31,370
I was...

2061
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:35,490
Those sounds I was hearing before that I thought someone was attacking me, they were attacking them.

2062
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:39,610
If I had been quicker, I could have, uh...

2063
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,910
I could have helped them.

2064
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:44,350
Oh well.

2065
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,070
Okay, I think that marked it.

2066
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,310
Did it?

2067
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,090
I think we marked it.

2068
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:51,510
It's on the thing.

2069
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,850
No, it's still not on the map.

2070
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,630
Oh, it's gone now.

2071
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:58,470
The portal is still there.

2072
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:06,000
Oh my gosh.

2073
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,500
Maybe if I try the other side.

2074
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,950
Oh, there we go.

2075
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:16,850
Okay, we got it.

2076
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,450
Meet the zoomer.

2077
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:24,930
I'm zooming.

2078
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,340
Okay.

2079
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:35,120
Nice.

2080
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,500
What's over here?

2081
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,740
Is this, uh...

2082
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,280
This looks like...

2083
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:39,940
Oh, this looks like...

2084
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,140
A gar-las-a-gea.

2085
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,100
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

2086
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,060
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

2087
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:52,960
Yeah, yeah.

2088
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:58,340
Oh.

2089
01:32:59,060 --> 01:32:59,820
Oh my god, dog.

2090
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:01,760
No.

2091
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,520
No.

2092
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,260
Oh shoot.

2093
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:04,860
Come on, don't...

2094
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:05,300
Don't run.

2095
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,640
Don't run.

2096
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:12,580
Okay.

2097
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,440
Very good.

2098
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,660
Very good.

2099
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,900
He's got moves.

2100
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,500
Oh, where am I?

2101
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,880
Okay, I'm trying to get up back to the path.

2102
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,680
And here we go.

2103
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:27,940
Oh.

2104
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,400
Oh yeah, that's right.

2105
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:30,420
Yeah.

2106
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:31,860
Sorry, buddy.

2107
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,720
He looks so...

2108
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,020
There's no way I'm going in there.

2109
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,940
He looks so lost.

2110
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:39,540
Like he doesn't know what to do.

2111
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,180
He has no purpose now.

2112
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:42,680
Oh.

2113
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:43,640
Who are you?

2114
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:46,220
Is it necessary that you speak with me?

2115
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,440
Sorry.

2116
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:47,960
Oh.

2117
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,140
Wait, who are you?

2118
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,020
Are you allowed to be on this horse?

2119
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,440
Wait, what are you doing?

2120
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,880
Sorry, no time to talk.

2121
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,340
I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier.

2122
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,180
Have you heard of the Blackwood Company?

2123
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,460
Read all about them.

2124
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:03,900
Oh.

2125
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:04,980
Okay.

2126
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,480
Golly.

2127
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:09,100
She's busy being a little lady over here.

2128
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,760
Okay, we get it.

2129
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:11,400
The portal.

2130
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,340
We get it.

2131
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:18,620
Oh, our beautiful town is like so ugly right now.

2132
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,800
Read all about it.

2133
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,900
Okay, I think we are far enough from the...

2134
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,180
From the portal's influence.

2135
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:36,720
Everyone's so rude in this game.

2136
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,060
You know, I would be too.

2137
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,300
If I wasn't sure if...

2138
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,920
Who's friend or foe, you know?

2139
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,380
Yeah, let's...

2140
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:48,980
Maybe...

2141
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,960
Well, I don't want to sleep here because it won't be free.

2142
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,440
Takanashi Kiara?

2143
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:57,640
What's wrong?

2144
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:58,900
Welcome to the end.

2145
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,860
A whole live English's myth?

2146
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,740
If you ruin your answer, speak with Kristoff.

2147
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,500
No way.

2148
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,660
Where does our food come from?

2149
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,980
The heartlands.

2150
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,680
And the Nebunian Valley.

2151
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,180
And Skingrad?

2152
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,820
Great wines, cheeses, and tomatoes.

2153
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:15,400
Tomatoes.

2154
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,300
You too.

2155
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,360
You too.

2156
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,260
I didn't say anything.

2157
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:25,640
I could open one of these doors and sleep without paying for it.

2158
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:26,600
In fact, that's what I'll do.

2159
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,360
I'm the hero of Kvatch.

2160
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,940
I deserve this.

2161
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,320
In my bed now...

2162
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,260
Will they notice, or...

2163
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,960
Just shut the door.

2164
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:53,660
It's fine.

2165
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,070
Waste of my time and my resources.

2166
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:07,870
You've got my ear.

2167
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:08,730
Let's hear it.

2168
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:09,810
Have you heard about Kvatch?

2169
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:13,990
They say that Daedra came from Oblivion and burned the whole city to the ground.

2170
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:15,310
Oh no.

2171
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:16,790
Without question.

2172
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:17,630
Oh no.

2173
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:19,330
What's the news from the other parts of Tamriel?

2174
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,230
Nothing I'd like to talk about.

2175
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:22,890
Using that reason a lot, hero.

2176
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:25,390
What is it now?

2177
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:27,930
I don't even know you, Ariel.

2178
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,330
Good afternoon.

2179
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:31,270
Ariel.

2180
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,050
Dry.

2181
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:36,630
Wait.

2182
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,990
The ocean is where it's all at.

2183
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,110
Do do do do.

2184
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:40,630
Boop.

2185
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:41,150
Boop.

2186
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:41,690
Boop.

2187
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:41,990
Boop.

2188
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:42,390
Boop.

2189
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:44,550
Go ahead.

2190
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:45,190
I'm listening.

2191
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:51,590
On Cyrodiil's northern border is the sparsely populated mountain wilderness called the Valeus Mountains.

2192
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:52,250
What is it now?

2193
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:53,870
So I've heard.

2194
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55,590
Can I sleep in this bed?

2195
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:56,970
Damn.

2196
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:02,510
I don't want to pay for a bed.

2197
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,890
I'd rather just like find another bed.

2198
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,130
We'll go to one of our guilds here.

2199
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:12,150
I think.

2200
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,230
We'll go to a guild.

2201
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:16,770
Who died?

2202
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:18,490
Oh my god.

2203
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,190
Horse?

2204
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:27,220
You dream about going up there.

2205
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,340
Now that is a big mistake.

2206
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,060
Just look at the world around you.

2207
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,400
Right here on the ocean floor.

2208
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,200
Oh.

2209
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:41,820
Oh.

2210
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:42,380
Oh shoot.

2211
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:42,860
Oh.

2212
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,880
I just saw you.

2213
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:44,340
Sorry.

2214
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,780
Oh shoot.

2215
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,780
I didn't see you highwayman.

2216
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,120
I'm the highwayman.

2217
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:07,580
Sorry.

2218
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,600
I really didn't see you there.

2219
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:11,300
I don't...

2220
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:12,660
I saw the uh...

2221
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,880
I saw the chest and that's it.

2222
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,080
I only thought about stealing.

2223
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,380
And not about you doing.

2224
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,140
An average chest.

2225
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,380
Little mermaid watch along.

2226
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:30,460
Do we need that?

2227
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:35,310
Dog?

2228
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:37,750
Is that a dog?

2229
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,730
That's fine.

2230
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,050
We're going to the haunted house.

2231
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:44,350
Live action.

2232
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:47,470
I watched the live action little mermaid on the plane.

2233
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:51,950
I think you guys when I come back so...

2234
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:55,650
So they typically update the um...

2235
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,790
The...

2236
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:59,330
The movie list monthly.

2237
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:08,610
And I know because sometimes I'll go to Japan and when I come back it'll be a different month.

2238
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,270
Like I'll...

2239
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:11,110
You know, I'll go like towards the end of the month.

2240
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:12,830
Like what's happening this time.

2241
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:14,650
And I come back and it's a different month.

2242
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:19,830
And the movie that I was watching on the way there is not on the plane anymore.

2243
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,610
Did you ever get that?

2244
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:22,810
Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.

2245
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:25,210
Who are you?

2246
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,750
Oh my god.

2247
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:26,730
I think I'm in trouble.

2248
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:28,090
What's happening?

2249
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,290
Make the liar?

2250
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,030
Who is this guy?

2251
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,420
But um...

2252
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:42,220
I think next month the Minecraft movie will be on it for sure.

2253
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,400
Wait, who is this guy?

2254
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,760
No, no, no, I'm busy.

2255
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,140
Oh my god, he's so fast.

2256
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,760
I can't run anymore.

2257
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,240
The man himself...

2258
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,240
Oh, put down your...

2259
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,400
My weapon, okay.

2260
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,020
Why...

2261
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:05,820
Where is he going?

2262
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,440
Oh my god.

2263
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,860
Oh my god.

2264
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:19,760
I'm almost there.

2265
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,940
He has a mission.

2266
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,120
Good golly, man.

2267
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,260
I'm trying to catch up to him.

2268
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:30,940
I really am.

2269
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,360
He's just really stinking fast.

2270
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:41,850
What the hell?

2271
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:42,670
Okay.

2272
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,970
I'm almost there.

2273
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:46,370
Oh my gosh.

2274
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:47,230
We're going to catch up to him.

2275
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:50,930
Please!

2276
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:52,830
Slow down!

2277
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:01,250
I'm trying.

2278
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,290
Oh my gosh.

2279
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:02,830
I'm almost there.

2280
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:03,490
I'm almost there.

2281
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,770
I can...

2282
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:05,210
I can...

2283
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:05,310
Oh!

2284
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,410
Myik knows much.

2285
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:08,810
Tells some.

2286
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:12,850
Myik knows many things others do not.

2287
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,250
Why were you running?

2288
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,930
Myik thinks his people are beautiful.

2289
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:23,590
The Argonian people are beautiful as well.

2290
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:26,550
They look better than ever before.

2291
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,510
That's the rumors?

2292
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,630
Why are you running?

2293
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,150
But he's a liar.

2294
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,550
Myik the liar.

2295
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:36,410
You too.

2296
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,690
And then he's going to take off again.

2297
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:40,110
Where is he going?

2298
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,140
You know what?

2299
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,740
I think he's the main character of this story.

2300
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:00,820
Myik provides different dev commentary every time.

2301
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:01,840
What?

2302
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:07,250
He's the best NPC.

2303
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:09,470
You guys, I'm afraid we'll never see him again.

2304
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,190
He's, he's gone.

2305
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:14,050
He's gone for good.

2306
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,560
I have to run all the way back.

2307
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,120
He pops in here and there.

2308
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,340
I see.

2309
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:30,800
Myik.

2310
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,940
Okay, I'll look forward to seeing him again.

2311
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,800
He hangs out at different places.

2312
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,600
Well, good thing we caught him when we did.

2313
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,480
Oh, Myik.

2314
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,160
I wish I had a horse.

2315
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,580
I wish...

2316
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:57,010
You got this.

2317
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,650
Good job.

2318
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:02,430
There he goes.

2319
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,350
Oh, it's one of the lizards.

2320
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:09,290
One of the lizards got through.

2321
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:11,090
Wait, where are you?

2322
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:11,690
Oh, there you are.

2323
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:13,290
Yes.

2324
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:16,610
Rumors?

2325
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:18,710
The Kvatch Oblivion Gate has been closed.

2326
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:20,550
Don't you understand what that means?

2327
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,090
Liquidos, thank you.

2328
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:23,430
Farewell, citizen.

2329
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:27,490
She's programmed to seek out the nearest pair of calipers.

2330
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,250
Wherever they may be.

2331
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:31,810
What?

2332
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:34,710
Speak.

2333
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:35,790
Speak.

2334
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,840
Did you finish delivering your thing, lady?

2335
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,400
All right, let's go get a haunted house, you guys.

2336
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:51,990
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

2337
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:54,230
Almost fast.

2338
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:56,530
Oh, now you want to talk to me, huh?

2339
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:57,630
Wait, wait.

2340
01:43:58,570 --> 01:43:59,470
Just please.

2341
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:00,770
Wait, hold on.

2342
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:05,410
He's in other games as well.

2343
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:07,190
It's really cool to see you got him.

2344
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:07,870
Oh, neat.

2345
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:08,970
Sorry, no time to talk.

2346
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:11,330
I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier.

2347
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:12,770
Oh, she gave me another one.

2348
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:15,190
Read all about it.

2349
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:18,770
All right.

2350
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,770
Haunted house.

2351
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:24,910
Guys, will I see a ghost or...

2352
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:25,990
What?

2353
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,570
Oh gosh, I'm so excited.

2354
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:29,910
I'm so excited.

2355
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,620
I'm gonna walk in there and be like, Hey there, demons.

2356
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,100
It's me.

2357
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:40,380
Ya boi.

2358
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,940
I see a ghost.

2359
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,660
I see a ghost right now.

2360
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:57,700
Gang.

2361
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,320
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang.

2362
01:44:59,320 --> 01:44:59,540
Darling.

2363
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,620
An all-female gang of thieves has been recently plaguing Anvil with a very unique method of robbing.

2364
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:08,980
They pick on only the men.

2365
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:13,660
If you want to help us do something about it, go talk to Gogan and Melona.

2366
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:18,280
Let's just say Gogan is intimately involved and leave it at that.

2367
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,400
Ha ha.

2368
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,750
It's unbelievable.

2369
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,290
Oh, that's right.

2370
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:30,830
There was a...

2371
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:33,590
Right in the center of the city, nobody saw anything.

2372
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:37,110
Makes you wonder about the competence of the guard, if you ask me.

2373
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:37,770
There was the attack.

2374
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,310
Everyone's been talking about it.

2375
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:39,970
Any rumors?

2376
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:41,990
Arvina Thelis is an odd one.

2377
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:45,570
I've heard some strange noises coming from her basement.

2378
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,990
What?

2379
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,390
Wait.

2380
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,650
Oh wait, it's an occupied place?

2381
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:50,110
I see a ghost in the bottom right corner.

2382
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:52,510
Goodbye.

2383
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:55,470
You guys have such good sixth sense.

2384
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:58,390
If you can see me all the time.

2385
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:04,930
Or maybe I've just sucked so much life force from you guys that...

2386
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:07,470
I'm all-powerful.

2387
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:08,690
You know.

2388
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:17,310
It's quiet here.

2389
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:18,330
Oh, never mind.

2390
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:19,190
Where did you come from?

2391
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:19,590
The bushes?

2392
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:21,910
Penniless...

2393
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:22,670
Ovis?

2394
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:26,290
We'll see about that.

2395
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:27,770
Are you really penniless?

2396
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:30,930
Yeah, he is.

2397
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:33,890
I've been out of work since November.

2398
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:35,490
Finally landed an interview today!

2399
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:36,110
Cody!

2400
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:38,230
Cody!

2401
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:42,350
It's amazing you got an interview, but...

2402
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:43,490
Don't send me super chat them.

2403
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:47,510
Is this the house?

2404
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,610
No way.

2405
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,150
Is this it?

2406
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,630
Can I buy this?

2407
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,290
Good luck, Cody!

2408
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,130
You got this!

2409
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:57,850
You got this.

2410
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:01,650
Oh, whoa.

2411
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,050
No-oh!

2412
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:06,070
It's not an abandoned house!

2413
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:07,270
A stranger.

2414
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:09,830
You wear the shadows well, fellow thief.

2415
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:11,550
You're my brother?

2416
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:13,710
Who are you?

2417
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,830
I...

2418
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:15,810
Am the stranger.

2419
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:16,670
Oh, that's your name!

2420
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,150
That is all you need to know, that.

2421
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,330
And I am no one to be trifled with.

2422
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:22,710
Okay, stranger.

2423
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:23,830
Sure.

2424
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:26,650
Go down to the chapel and you can't miss him.

2425
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:29,950
He'll be the one outside, ranting at passers-by.

2426
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:32,290
About the thieves' guild.

2427
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:35,110
I don't have time to gossip about the guild right now.

2428
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:36,850
Okay.

2429
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:38,790
I'm listening.

2430
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:40,710
Leave me with a little persuading, alright?

2431
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:42,630
Let's try.

2432
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:44,510
Wait.

2433
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:48,850
Why can't I... Why can't... It won't let me, actually.

2434
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,190
No way.

2435
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:53,490
It won't let me.

2436
01:47:54,410 --> 01:47:55,050
Aw, man.

2437
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,110
Shadow hide you.

2438
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,930
Myth or menace.

2439
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,570
Oh, so this is all your stuff.

2440
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:02,950
Okay.

2441
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:03,890
Goodbye.

2442
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:07,790
There's nothing else in here.

2443
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,170
Your house is...

2444
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:11,830
Disgusting.

2445
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:15,110
Myth or menace.

2446
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:21,580
Okay.

2447
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,280
Well, clearly he's not part of that.

2448
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,920
He's the stranger.

2449
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:29,520
Arvina!

2450
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:31,100
She said that lady was strange.

2451
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:32,980
Alright, guys.

2452
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,060
You're gonna have to point me to the direction of our new home.

2453
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:40,880
You're gonna have to say...

2454
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,160
Newheim the portly.

2455
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,120
The inn behind you.

2456
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,360
Go towards the inn?

2457
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:51,700
Okay.

2458
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:54,560
I wanna see...

2459
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:55,680
Oh.

2460
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,220
Is there anybody home?

2461
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:04,030
I'm not trespassing.

2462
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:08,310
I'm actually doing right.

2463
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:09,630
Oh!

2464
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:13,850
Hello.

2465
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:25,740
Oh.

2466
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:27,680
Oh, yeah.

2467
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:29,160
He's got some sick moves.

2468
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,080
I'm Newheim.

2469
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,020
Anvil Harbor Master.

2470
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:39,400
I'm responsible for all harbor traffic, docks, duties, and fees in Anvil Harbor.

2471
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,720
Ducks and duties?

2472
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,740
Leave me alone.

2473
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,300
Okay.

2474
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:45,040
Sorry.

2475
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:49,660
I...

2476
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:52,520
I expected him to be a little...

2477
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,500
More...

2478
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,820
More...

2479
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:55,760
Bigger.

2480
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,220
I don't know.

2481
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,220
This is not...

2482
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:00,340
Okay.

2483
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,560
Chesson Sextius?

2484
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,280
Chesson Sextius?

2485
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,200
Of the Tootius Sextius household name?

2486
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,760
No kidding!

2487
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:25,460
No kidding!

2488
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:28,700
Interesting!

2489
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:29,900
Wow!

2490
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,960
I didn't know!

2491
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,140
Fox Glove.

2492
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,760
I didn't know that they were a family!

2493
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:41,220
Alright.

2494
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,140
I'm looking for the N.

2495
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,080
Oh, here, here.

2496
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,060
Nope.

2497
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,480
That's the Count's Arms.

2498
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:50,420
N.

2499
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,300
This looks like...

2500
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,300
What is this?

2501
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:56,140
Oh, the Mage's Guild.

2502
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,180
I'm a part of that.

2503
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:58,640
Hello.

2504
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,320
The Fighter's Guild.

2505
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,660
We could sleep at the Mage's Guild.

2506
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,020
Oh, that was the N.

2507
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,040
Oh, it was?

2508
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,720
Count's Arms is an N.

2509
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,420
Wow.

2510
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,480
The more you know...

2511
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:14,640
This?

2512
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:16,140
Oh, wait.

2513
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:18,700
But...

2514
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,360
Oh, sorry.

2515
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,180
I didn't mean to go in.

2516
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:20,780
It was happening.

2517
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:21,640
Hello there.

2518
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:21,700
Hello.

2519
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,880
Wow, this place is fancy, though.

2520
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,080
Wow.

2521
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:28,460
Feels like I would actually get a good night's rest here, right?

2522
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:31,480
Okay.

2523
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:32,980
So, we're at the Inn.

2524
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:34,700
Now...

2525
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,560
Where do I go to get our haunted house?

2526
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,880
Oh, there's a guy in there who will sell you the house.

2527
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:41,700
Just kidding.

2528
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,760
We turn around.

2529
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,580
Hello there.

2530
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,060
Oh.

2531
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:47,320
Greetings to you.

2532
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:48,280
Oh, goodbye.

2533
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,380
Didier Ormalee, a ship's clerk.

2534
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,720
At present, I'm spending my time in gold on the pleasures of the Gold Coast.

2535
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:55,620
Okay.

2536
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:57,400
You don't seem like you'll sell me a...

2537
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,740
A house.

2538
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,360
Hello, good...

2539
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,000
You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home, would you?

2540
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:02,400
Yes!

2541
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,120
If you are.

2542
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,040
I just happen to be selling a manor located right here in Anvil.

2543
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:07,640
Oh, yes.

2544
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,600
Tell me more.

2545
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,340
Tell me more.

2546
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:09,920
Yes.

2547
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,760
I'm selling my grandfather's house.

2548
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:12,960
Beneris Manor.

2549
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:13,620
Beneris Manor.

2550
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:16,680
If you're interested, I could let you have it for a modest sum.

2551
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:17,300
Okay.

2552
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,520
I have to sell it soon as I have pressing matters elsewhere.

2553
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:21,500
Okay.

2554
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,380
You're welcome to take a look at it.

2555
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,480
It's located across the street from the chapel.

2556
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:29,680
Once you buy, you get the key to the front door and the deed of ownership.

2557
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,000
That's the deal.

2558
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:32,940
Would you like to buy it now?

2559
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,600
I haven't even seen it.

2560
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,780
Wait, it's 5,000 gold.

2561
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:37,820
How much do I have?

2562
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:41,060
Well, I'll be here every day from noon until midnight.

2563
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:43,080
Let me know if you change your mind.

2564
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,240
Noon until midnight.

2565
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,180
Don't you have a home?

2566
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,400
Why don't you live here?

2567
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,260
Okay, let's go check it out.

2568
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,640
How much do I have?

2569
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:57,080
How much gold do I have?

2570
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:58,180
How can I tell?

2571
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,020
1.3...

2572
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:07,040
Oh, I see it.

2573
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,840
Does he take a loan?

2574
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:18,460
How are you?

2575
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,060
How are you?

2576
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:23,400
Across from the...

2577
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,060
Wait.

2578
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,580
Where's the...

2579
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,420
I'm lost.

2580
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:33,340
Gosh.

2581
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,900
Taking pennies.

2582
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:38,580
Taking one gold, one gold is doing me nothing, you know?

2583
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:43,040
Across from...

2584
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:43,720
So...

2585
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,480
Here?

2586
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:45,880
Maybe?

2587
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,680
Oak and hole?

2588
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:52,220
Uh...

2589
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,640
This is not a house.

2590
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,820
Do some dungeon runs.

2591
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

2592
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:03,200
Oh, come on!

2593
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,980
They won't even let me see inside.

2594
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,500
Nooo!

2595
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:10,260
Maybe there's a...

2596
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,760
Way I can break in.

2597
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,320
It's my home!

2598
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,820
My soon to be home!

2599
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,040
Aw, man.

2600
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,920
It's a big house.

2601
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,420
Yeah, it's crazy.

2602
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:26,600
It's crazy.

2603
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:30,720
It has a romantic balcony and everything.

2604
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,610
Where I can just wistfully...

2605
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,480
Uh...

2606
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,320
Wistfully hope...

2607
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,450
That someday...

2608
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,160
I'll look like this lady.

2609
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:40,690
Just sit and...

2610
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,780
You know...

2611
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:43,530
Ponder...

2612
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:45,510
Look to the sea...

2613
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:49,300
Be a hot mermaid...

2614
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,500
Only 3700 gold to go.

2615
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,160
Let's go sleep in the mage's guild.

2616
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:00,900
Hmm...

2617
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,340
Hmm...

2618
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,900
I know people have told me...

2619
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,080
How to get...

2620
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,100
Gold fast in this game, but...

2621
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:08,480
Oh my gosh.

2622
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,080
Sparky!

2623
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,260
It's you.

2624
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,340
Hi.

2625
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,180
You don't know me!

2626
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:18,300
Alright then, I'm listening.

2627
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,420
Thank you, we're homeless.

2628
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,300
I'm sorry!

2629
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:26,800
Let's go sleep.

2630
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,240
But yeah, I can't remember what people told me.

2631
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,100
What was the best way?

2632
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:36,780
Oh, I can't steal that?

2633
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:37,600
But I'm a member!

2634
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,560
Why can't I have this...

2635
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,300
This soul gem for me to...

2636
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:44,600
Wait, why can't I take these?

2637
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:55,290
Oh, alchemy.

2638
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:58,190
Guilt missions are a normal way to make money.

2639
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:00,090
Normal.

2640
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,150
Normal.

2641
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,270
Hello, where's your beds?

2642
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,550
Everyone's chomp-chomping.

2643
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:14,730
What is it?

2644
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:20,330
This is a library.

2645
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:22,730
Maybe through here.

2646
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,320
Door very hard.

2647
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:34,680
Oh!

2648
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:39,860
It didn't...

2649
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,500
It wasn't red.

2650
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:50,370
Very hard on my butt.

2651
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:52,030
Oh!

2652
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:53,070
See?

2653
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:54,710
We found the bed.

2654
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,430
Easy peasy.

2655
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:06,020
Save for a good amount of time.

2656
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,220
Level seven.

2657
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:13,900
Okay.

2658
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:14,540
Whoa!

2659
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:15,800
We have so many...

2660
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:15,940
Okay.

2661
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,740
So agility...

2662
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:19,300
A lot.

2663
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,520
We're almost all the way...

2664
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:22,700
Agile.

2665
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:24,620
Gosh, we're so good.

2666
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:26,880
What was I putting in also?

2667
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:28,100
I guess it looks like...

2668
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,840
Into speed?

2669
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:33,940
Speed?

2670
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:34,780
What's endurance?

2671
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:36,680
Uh...

2672
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,160
An endurance, maybe.

2673
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,940
Maybe like that.

2674
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,090
I don't mind...

2675
01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:51,030
I think maybe I was doing some strength.

2676
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:54,310
Oh wait.

2677
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,270
With my bow.

2678
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:56,430
Maybe not speed then.

2679
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:57,530
I was gonna say...

2680
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:59,490
I don't mind being faster, but...

2681
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:02,450
I think we need to be stronger.

2682
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:06,070
Oh wait, no.

2683
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:07,650
Wait, which is...

2684
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,570
Wait, I was reading...

2685
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:09,430
Oh, it's a...

2686
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,310
It was...

2687
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,590
Agility I was reading.

2688
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:15,230
I'm stupid.

2689
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:15,790
Okay.

2690
01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:15,870
Okay.

2691
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:17,290
This...

2692
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:19,450
This one does let you carry more weight.

2693
01:58:22,370 --> 01:58:23,070
Hmm...

2694
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:24,390
Uh...

2695
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:28,850
I think we've been putting stuff into it.

2696
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:31,610
Yeah, whatever.

2697
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:35,210
Oh.

2698
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:42,700
Hey.

2699
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:44,840
Well met.

2700
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,320
Well met...

2701
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:47,040
Oh, what was that?

2702
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,160
Was that that?

2703
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,720
I didn't knock that over.

2704
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:57,120
That was freaky.

2705
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,020
Oh, I could've slept in here.

2706
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:05,340
With a...

2707
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:06,980
Hot Maiden.

2708
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,140
Weakness to disease.

2709
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,200
I like that.

2710
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,320
Oh, come on.

2711
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,100
She wants me in the bed.

2712
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:24,460
Hello, associate.

2713
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,060
Hello.

2714
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:32,280
To earn a recommendation from me, you need simply prove you are able-bodied and prepared to learn something in the process.

2715
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,280
I played their cover of Break Stuff?

2716
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:40,500
The sillier, softer one over the intercom at work, and someone literally told an employee they assumed it was some ghost?

2717
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,260
What?

2718
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:46,520
What?

2719
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:46,540
Huh?

2720
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:51,600
The Mage's Guild has made more than a few enemies since necromancy was banned.

2721
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:55,220
Why is necromancy banned?

2722
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:58,360
Farewell.

2723
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,720
Crystal ball.

2724
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:03,680
That looks fancy.

2725
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,380
Guys, I need to...

2726
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:08,540
I need to make money.

2727
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:12,470
I need...

2728
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:13,510
I need to make money.

2729
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,130
What should I...

2730
02:00:16,130 --> 02:00:16,870
What should I do?

2731
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:41,540
Sell...

2732
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:42,700
Things.

2733
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:47,240
Like, should I start taking some of this stuff and then sell it?

2734
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:51,340
I could take all this stuff...

2735
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,540
And sell it.

2736
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,900
Thank you so much for the Redirect!

2737
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:58,700
Thank you!

2738
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,300
I'm gonna go sell all these things.

2739
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:05,980
It's free real estate.

2740
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:06,680
Yeah, exactly.

2741
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:09,960
And they're worth 50.

2742
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,500
Yes.

2743
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,140
These ones we can't take.

2744
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:19,140
Unfortunately.

2745
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:22,860
Thank you guys for the gift!

2746
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:23,560
Thank you!

2747
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:24,600
Thank you!

2748
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:25,160
Thank you!

2749
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,820
Thank you Ducky!

2750
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,700
Thank you Rock for Rubber!

2751
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,080
Thank you!

2752
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:29,180
Thank you guys!

2753
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,040
You think I can take these things?

2754
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:40,880
Block.

2755
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:42,380
Picking.

2756
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,040
Do I go?

2757
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:45,540
Thank you for the vibe.

2758
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,400
Good to thank you.

2759
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:51,530
Easy.

2760
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:56,470
Enthralling presence.

2761
02:01:56,530 --> 02:01:57,470
What does that mean?

2762
02:01:58,430 --> 02:01:58,770
Wait.

2763
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:00,470
What did I just grab?

2764
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:06,190
Absorb mysticism on touch.

2765
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:08,430
Absorb.

2766
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,930
Absorb it.

2767
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:13,950
Absorb strength on touch.

2768
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,610
How do I use these?

2769
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,210
Like, how do I actually...

2770
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,830
Charm on target.

2771
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:27,690
How do I...

2772
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,040
In the spell tab.

2773
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:32,400
Alchemy.

2774
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:35,880
There is no spell tab.

2775
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:37,480
There's alchemy.

2776
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:43,570
You just equip them.

2777
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:44,570
No kidding?

2778
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,250
Oh.

2779
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:53,490
I can only have one equipped at a time.

2780
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:53,650
No?

2781
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:55,610
At the very top.

2782
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:57,470
I still don't see spells.

2783
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:58,010
Magic?

2784
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,170
Ah, here we go.

2785
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:04,330
Ah...

2786
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:15,660
Open easy lock on target.

2787
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,500
Easy locks are easy.

2788
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:24,960
Can only be used once.

2789
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,600
They have a one time use.

2790
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:39,480
Sunshine welcome to membership thank you.

2791
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,520
Usually it's just best to sell scrolls they are worth a lot and have one use.

2792
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,620
Is that true?

2793
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:46,840
True.

2794
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,240
Let's see.

2795
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:49,880
It doesn't say how much they're worth.

2796
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:50,540
Let's see.

2797
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,420
This one's worth a good amount.

2798
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:56,700
Hmm.

2799
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:09,230
Hmm.

2800
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:09,930
Hmm.

2801
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:10,990
Oh.

2802
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:14,830
Let's go find... Wait, what time is it?

2803
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:16,430
6 a.m.

2804
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:16,710
Okay.

2805
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:18,870
The place... We gotta go find a store.

2806
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:20,310
And sell things.

2807
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:21,310
Maybe.

2808
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:23,910
Also...

2809
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:30,770
Look at the faces of the dead.

2810
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:34,250
I wouldn't go in there unless you have a strong stomach.

2811
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:40,150
We have orders to leave everything just the way it was until the investigation into the chapel attack is finished.

2812
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:40,710
Oh my god.

2813
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,790
You scared me.

2814
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:44,150
It's baffling.

2815
02:04:44,330 --> 02:04:49,230
How anyone could have gotten in and out of there without being seen by our patrols is beyond me.

2816
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:51,130
Maybe that prophet is right.

2817
02:04:51,790 --> 02:04:54,550
Some kind of unholy scared me.

2818
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:56,390
You scared the heck out of me.

2819
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,330
The prophet.

2820
02:04:58,630 --> 02:05:00,890
He preaches most of the day across the street from the chapel.

2821
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:01,430
Yeah, I know.

2822
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,470
I was looking at him.

2823
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:02,630
I used to think he was crazy.

2824
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:05,830
But now he seems to be making some kind of sense.

2825
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:09,330
I hope that doesn't mean I'm going crazy now.

2826
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:10,970
Classic oblivion jump scare.

2827
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:11,530
Haha.

2828
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:15,070
Captain Dougal's rumored treasure has to be true.

2829
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:18,890
I wonder if the first count of anvil found it.

2830
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:20,410
Treasure?

2831
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,450
Haha.

2832
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:25,210
This is your future.

2833
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:27,410
Evil has returned.

2834
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:28,010
Treasure?

2835
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:31,190
And the nine need a champion.

2836
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:34,630
Oh, well, well.

2837
02:05:35,290 --> 02:05:38,190
A wayward son returning to the church.

2838
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:40,190
What do you want with me?

2839
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:41,230
What are you doing?

2840
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:44,270
This is only the beginning.

2841
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:52,010
Umaril has returned as foretold by Pelinal Whitestrake in his dying breath.

2842
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:54,110
You're just saying names.

2843
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:55,090
You're just saying names.

2844
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:55,690
You're just saying things.

2845
02:05:55,690 --> 02:05:58,130
Tell me who attack- Just tell me who attacked the chapel.

2846
02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:00,770
Do you understand nothing?

2847
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,630
The blood speaks.

2848
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:07,610
I can read the ancient runes if you cannot.

2849
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:14,110
Umaril.

2850
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:15,570
I can read it too, okay?

2851
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:24,550
By the eternal power of Umaril, the mortal gods shall be cast down.

2852
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:28,930
A curse upon Umaril's ancient foes.

2853
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:30,910
And a threat.

2854
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:32,210
A threat?

2855
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:34,430
How do we stop Umaril?

2856
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:37,030
He looks so sad.

2857
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:38,910
Why not?

2858
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,530
No elves allowed in this quest?

2859
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:48,690
Without a champion, the gods are powerless to act.

2860
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:55,510
But who among us is worthy to wield the divine crusader's weaponry?

2861
02:06:57,150 --> 02:07:04,650
I will... I will... Among us... I don't know who will stop Umaril.

2862
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:07,270
Nor do... I.

2863
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:10,270
Oh, my people!

2864
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:13,910
Who will save you from destruction?

2865
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:18,250
Is there none now worthy to be your crusader?

2866
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:20,910
Wait a minute.

2867
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:21,870
Think on this.

2868
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:24,690
What happened here is...

2869
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:25,970
Is that real?

2870
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,150
Like, I actually wouldn't have been able to do it?

2871
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:36,450
Let me in, man.

2872
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:37,390
Greetings, Bosma.

2873
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:40,250
Oh, you can.

2874
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,130
Jam.

2875
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:48,110
Wow, they didn't even clean this up.

2876
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,090
Yikes.

2877
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,330
Oh, my God!

2878
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:53,810
They just left the people here!

2879
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,070
They've...

2880
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,950
Oh, my God.

2881
02:07:59,910 --> 02:08:00,630
Oh, shoot.

2882
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:01,130
I'm stealing.

2883
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:03,110
No one's in here.

2884
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:12,050
Oh, my gosh.

2885
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:14,850
Wait.

2886
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:15,770
Am I on fire?

2887
02:08:16,190 --> 02:08:16,850
What hurt me?

2888
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:21,720
I only need one key.

2889
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:23,600
Oh!

2890
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:25,980
They spelled ancient runes.

2891
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,000
Oh, my gosh!

2892
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:32,070
Whoa!

2893
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:36,270
I like how taking the plants is stealing.

2894
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,290
Whoa.

2895
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:39,370
No, I was joking.

2896
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:40,670
Oh, what the heck?

2897
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:42,850
You guys can't tell me things.

2898
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:43,730
I'll believe you.

2899
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,490
Why can't I go in here?

2900
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:51,230
I'm just gonna go.

2901
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,480
Oh, that was an actual ghost.

2902
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:03,800
Um...

2903
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,860
What about this one?

2904
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:08,760
That was...

2905
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:09,480
That was a ghost.

2906
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,580
Finally, I've seen a ghost in the game.

2907
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,300
Why are these areas off-limits, huh?

2908
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,500
Mass death from overeating strawberry jam.

2909
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,640
Don't eat the jam.

2910
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,640
This book is worth a hundred bucks!

2911
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:43,140
Frostfall.

2912
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:44,100
Wait.

2913
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:45,220
I just gained something.

2914
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:45,540
Oh.

2915
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:46,840
Conjuration.

2916
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,020
Ooh.

2917
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:50,520
Yoink.

2918
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:54,890
The Amulet of Kings.

2919
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:06,860
Hmm.

2920
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,960
You guys are selling some stuff, huh?

2921
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:09,860
Um...

2922
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:10,660
Can I open this one?

2923
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:10,920
Yeah.

2924
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:16,780
Nice.

2925
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:18,840
Nice.

2926
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,140
Nice.

2927
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:20,900
Uh...

2928
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,960
This one's worth 25.

2929
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,820
We'll sell some stuff soon.

2930
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:30,560
We gotta go find the...

2931
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,900
150 bucks!

2932
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,620
They're worth a fortune!

2933
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:42,290
Good find.

2934
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:43,430
Ooh.

2935
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:44,210
That one had pictures.

2936
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:49,330
Hmm-hmm.

2937
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:53,110
The Argonian account.

2938
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:57,170
Sweet rule!

2939
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:58,110
That looks delicious.

2940
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:02,190
She's rich.

2941
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:03,170
I will be.

2942
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:05,550
And then I'll spend it all on a house.

2943
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,150
Just like real life.

2944
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:15,650
Nobody's down here.

2945
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,000
What's so bad?

2946
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,160
Nobody's using any of this stuff anyway.

2947
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:28,580
So it's fine if I take it.

2948
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:31,980
You already sell the statues to the guy who...

2949
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,400
Buys them for double the value.

2950
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,320
Uh, I didn't know...

2951
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,520
A guy like that existed.

2952
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:38,900
So...

2953
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:40,900
I don't think so.

2954
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,660
There's nothing else in here.

2955
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:52,950
Oh, wait.

2956
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:53,510
Oh, yeah.

2957
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:55,150
It was, uh...

2958
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:55,870
Undercroft.

2959
02:11:56,830 --> 02:11:57,390
Undercroft.

2960
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:13,460
Does he guard the place?

2961
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:14,680
Or...

2962
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:17,300
Can I get him with...

2963
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:19,900
He's got hair.

2964
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:20,660
Ha-ha.

2965
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:21,160
Oh.

2966
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:30,870
Oh.

2967
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:31,310
There's a guy.

2968
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:37,090
Oh.

2969
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:37,710
Oh, shoot.

2970
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:50,930
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

2971
02:12:50,930 --> 02:13:13,660
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha I'm wondering if that green milk would taste good drinking out of it.

2972
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:18,020
I tried to find the creeper milk.

2973
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,300
I tried to find the creeper milk.

2974
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:23,160
I went to a couple different grocery stores and they didn't have it.

2975
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:24,860
And then...

2976
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:27,120
Well, you know what they had instead?

2977
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:28,960
Enderman milk.

2978
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:32,700
So I got that.

2979
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:33,680
Hi there.

2980
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,900
Okay, where is a store?

2981
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:42,050
What are you doing here?

2982
02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:44,630
Have pity on an old war veteran.

2983
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:46,750
This is an establishment.

2984
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:47,630
Hello.

2985
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,430
Hi there.

2986
02:13:50,690 --> 02:13:51,450
Is it purple?

2987
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:52,730
You would think, right?

2988
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:54,830
It's such a wasted opportunity.

2989
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:57,150
It's just chocolate milk.

2990
02:13:58,290 --> 02:14:01,830
Which I don't know the last time I had chocolate milk, so I was kind of excited.

2991
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:05,030
But I was like, it's just chalky milk.

2992
02:14:06,610 --> 02:14:07,950
It's so lame.

2993
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:11,250
When they even made the creeper milk green.

2994
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:13,950
They, like, actually attempted.

2995
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:17,570
I got a pumpkin.

2996
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:20,010
And now I'm over encumbered.

2997
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,220
Pumpkin.

2998
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,780
I wish to...

2999
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:34,900
Release you from my inventory.

3000
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:37,780
Where is he?

3001
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:43,220
JK Elemental Pumpkin.

3002
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:44,600
Oh, I ate it?

3003
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:52,490
Greetings, Bosmer.

3004
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:57,450
I don't see any stores in here.

3005
02:14:58,930 --> 02:15:00,210
And the lighthouse.

3006
02:15:01,490 --> 02:15:02,450
Main gate.

3007
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:04,630
What's no rest for the wicked?

3008
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:06,490
What is my quest currently?

3009
02:15:06,490 --> 02:15:07,970
Oh, I get another...

3010
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:10,610
Maybe I just keep doing contracts for the brotherhood.

3011
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:11,850
I don't know.

3012
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:18,560
Oh, here we go.

3013
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:18,840
Okay.

3014
02:15:28,110 --> 02:15:29,090
Abandoned house.

3015
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:31,130
What are the peacemakers?

3016
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:36,110
The peacemakers?

3017
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:36,510
The manor?

3018
02:15:40,570 --> 02:15:41,210
Hmm.

3019
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:46,210
That's a weapon shop.

3020
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:46,690
Ah.

3021
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:51,290
So far the brotherhood seems to give you gear.

3022
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:53,250
They have been giving me money too.

3023
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:55,910
Albeit, not a lot.

3024
02:15:56,350 --> 02:15:58,490
But I have gotten some cents.

3025
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:01,190
I got a hundred gold last time.

3026
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,920
You will get a cool bow.

3027
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,200
I want that.

3028
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,100
Fighter's Guild is quickish gold too?

3029
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:15,500
Still okay.

3030
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:19,260
How are you?

3031
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,460
Oh, this is the castle.

3032
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:21,440
Whoa!

3033
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,480
Right now I'm still...

3034
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:26,900
Even if I don't get the house right away.

3035
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:30,900
I've still been enjoying myself with exploration.

3036
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:33,260
Sorry, I thought that was dookie on the ground.

3037
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:35,520
Oh, here we go.

3038
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:37,220
What's the fu...

3039
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:38,100
Oh, fu...

3040
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:38,800
Fox.

3041
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:39,340
Fox.

3042
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:39,660
Fox.

3043
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:40,160
Fox.

3044
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:40,220
Oh.

3045
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:42,400
Have you heard any word about the other provinces?

3046
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:43,520
There we go.

3047
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:44,720
Oh, I can't go in there.

3048
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:45,740
Just kidding.

3049
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:49,520
Here we go.

3050
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,700
Norbert?

3051
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:02,120
I'm Norbert Lels.

3052
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:04,780
I let my merchandise speak for itself.

3053
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:05,620
Look around.

3054
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:08,860
If you see something you like, we'll talk about a price.

3055
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:09,920
Okay.

3056
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,280
We'll see.

3057
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,740
How much do you like me?

3058
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:21,380
No.

3059
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:23,160
You do me too much honor.

3060
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,580
No.

3061
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:25,860
Uh-oh.

3062
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:26,480
I messed up.

3063
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:27,260
I spent a minute.

3064
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:27,960
Oh, gosh.

3065
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:29,020
You win this one.

3066
02:17:34,110 --> 02:17:35,110
Blah, blah, blah.

3067
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:35,710
Oh.

3068
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:36,230
What a bore.

3069
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:36,730
Uh-oh.

3070
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:37,230
I messed up.

3071
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:38,170
You think that's funny?

3072
02:17:38,370 --> 02:17:38,690
Uh-oh.

3073
02:17:38,810 --> 02:17:39,370
Let's try again.

3074
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:40,070
Let's try again.

3075
02:17:41,070 --> 02:17:42,170
What a dumb joke.

3076
02:17:42,450 --> 02:17:44,490
It's a good joke, actually.

3077
02:17:44,910 --> 02:17:45,290
But...

3078
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:45,670
That's enough.

3079
02:17:45,870 --> 02:17:46,530
Oh, shoot.

3080
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:47,750
Oh, shoot.

3081
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:48,810
Really now?

3082
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:49,830
Blah, blah, blah.

3083
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,190
No!

3084
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:50,890
What a bore.

3085
02:17:50,890 --> 02:17:51,310
Oh, my gosh.

3086
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:52,290
I went down crazy.

3087
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:53,730
Uh...

3088
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:54,250
Uh...

3089
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:55,350
What a wonderful compliment.

3090
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:56,650
Don't make me laugh.

3091
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:57,310
I won't fight.

3092
02:17:57,450 --> 02:17:58,250
What a dumb joke.

3093
02:17:58,730 --> 02:17:59,130
Okay.

3094
02:17:59,430 --> 02:17:59,670
Okay.

3095
02:18:00,210 --> 02:18:00,650
I...

3096
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:01,710
I...

3097
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:02,970
I've saved that one.

3098
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:03,190
Okay.

3099
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:06,930
You're full of it.

3100
02:18:07,310 --> 02:18:08,170
You're full of it.

3101
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:08,990
Sorry, I don't get...

3102
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:09,310
Please.

3103
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:10,270
I mean...

3104
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:11,030
I won't fight you.

3105
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:12,090
Okay, we're at 60.

3106
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:12,910
We're at 60.

3107
02:18:15,810 --> 02:18:16,250
Uh...

3108
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:18,130
You've got a point.

3109
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:19,510
What a dumb joke.

3110
02:18:20,130 --> 02:18:20,570
Please.

3111
02:18:20,890 --> 02:18:22,150
You're a big, fat liar.

3112
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:22,950
64?

3113
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:23,890
64?

3114
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:28,610
Sorry, I don't get it.

3115
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:29,070
Oh, no.

3116
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:30,010
I'm gonna...

3117
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:30,530
Oh, shoot.

3118
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,630
Really now?

3119
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:32,730
You're a big...

3120
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:33,790
You win this one.

3121
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:34,390
67!

3122
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:39,530
I can't do anymore.

3123
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:40,570
Okay, dang it.

3124
02:18:41,290 --> 02:18:42,750
We maxed to 67.

3125
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:45,390
Only quality goods for sale here.

3126
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,110
What can I interest you in?

3127
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,670
What do you have?

3128
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:01,900
A whole lot of junk.

3129
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,040
That's what it is.

3130
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:04,120
All right.

3131
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,860
Maybe we could get...

3132
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:11,820
52% of value on my books.

3133
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:15,800
Let's sell all these books that I recently acquired.

3134
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:18,660
What the heck is this Sufferthorn?

3135
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:20,300
When did I get that?

3136
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,040
It's worth so much.

3137
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:23,880
When did I get this?

3138
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:31,420
Where are my books?

3139
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:36,020
Do I have to go to the Thieves Guild?

3140
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,820
Oh, from the Dark Brotherhood.

3141
02:19:41,420 --> 02:19:42,840
It's my special dagger.

3142
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:52,760
Wait, the books aren't stolen.

3143
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:54,600
They weren't read.

3144
02:20:01,650 --> 02:20:02,230
Uh-oh.

3145
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:05,430
You need a fence.

3146
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:06,410
What's that mean?

3147
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:07,110
What do you mean?

3148
02:20:07,810 --> 02:20:08,650
They were read.

3149
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:09,630
No.

3150
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:09,900
Oh.

3151
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:12,750
Oh, the ones from the church.

3152
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,170
Yeah.

3153
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,610
Those were read.

3154
02:20:16,830 --> 02:20:17,370
Yeah.

3155
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:20,710
You can't do anything for me.

3156
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:21,190
Farewell.

3157
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:21,770
Yep.

3158
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:30,290
Where was the guy that I could sell to?

3159
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:32,890
There was, like, one guy in particular.

3160
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:37,270
Oh.

3161
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:39,090
Can I...

3162
02:20:39,090 --> 02:20:40,110
Is it...

3163
02:20:40,110 --> 02:20:41,270
Is it okay?

3164
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:43,330
If I...

3165
02:20:43,330 --> 02:20:43,650
Yeah?

3166
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:44,230
Okay, cool.

3167
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,700
Fence and Bruma.

3168
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:55,580
Thank you.

3169
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,080
Alright, let's go there, then.

3170
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:06,720
There was a special guy in Bruma that we could sell to.

3171
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,880
Titanic moment.

3172
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:11,280
Oh.

3173
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,000
Sorry, that was me trying to sing.

3174
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:18,540
Hi there.

3175
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:18,940
Oh.

3176
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:19,660
Hello.

3177
02:21:20,020 --> 02:21:20,840
I was trying to sing.

3178
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,080
Don't worry about it.

3179
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:27,000
Who was it here?

3180
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:27,940
Oh, gosh.

3181
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:28,240
Hold on.

3182
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:29,080
Let me go talk, too.

3183
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:30,800
Let's go find...

3184
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:31,540
Oops.

3185
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:32,060
Ouch.

3186
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:33,280
You okay?

3187
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:34,000
Eating?

3188
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:37,340
Oh.

3189
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:41,260
You look so...

3190
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:41,640
Hi there.

3191
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:42,700
You look frightening.

3192
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,540
He's at a dive bar downtown.

3193
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:46,680
What?

3194
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:51,160
What a house for sale.

3195
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:52,080
No, no, no.

3196
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:53,760
An eye on the prize.

3197
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:54,620
Eye on the prize.

3198
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,060
Maybe he's an Olavs.

3199
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,620
Today's your lucky day.

3200
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:02,800
Whoa.

3201
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:03,540
So let's hear it.

3202
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:04,980
You do not belong in me.

3203
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,360
What do you mean?

3204
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:08,320
I'm Balin.

3205
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:11,060
Oh, Balin.

3206
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,460
I loved you, old man.

3207
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:14,680
Oh, I killed your...

3208
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:15,680
I loved you.

3209
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:18,100
But I couldn't protect you.

3210
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:20,000
Oh, Balin.

3211
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:25,440
Not normally a big fan.

3212
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:27,460
She can spin a yarn.

3213
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:28,500
That's for sure.

3214
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:30,060
Be seeing you.

3215
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,100
His face.

3216
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:32,720
His face.

3217
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:33,400
Hello.

3218
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,040
Hello.

3219
02:22:34,700 --> 02:22:35,440
Hi there.

3220
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:37,100
Hi there.

3221
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:37,740
How are you?

3222
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,340
I see you are with the gray fox.

3223
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:41,920
Do you need a fence?

3224
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:42,920
Like...

3225
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:43,340
Shh.

3226
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:43,800
Shh.

3227
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,640
Yes.

3228
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,380
Yes, I do.

3229
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,640
Yes, I need a fox.

3230
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:51,820
All thieves guild members have sworn loyalty to him.

3231
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:55,700
If there is such a thing as a guild master, he's it.

3232
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:58,240
Wait, I can't wear Bruma.

3233
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:01,400
Bruma is a perfect town for a Nord man of leisure.

3234
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:06,880
Bracing mountain air, good food and drink, and lively Nord fellowship.

3235
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:09,200
Um...

3236
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:11,400
Where can I...

3237
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:12,260
What do you want to know?

3238
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:13,380
Oh, wait, you are my guy.

3239
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:14,100
Just kidding.

3240
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,040
I can handle some...

3241
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:17,100
Okay.

3242
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:18,260
Do you like me?

3243
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:18,380
All right.

3244
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:18,940
Oh.

3245
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:21,640
She does not like me.

3246
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,750
You should be ashamed.

3247
02:23:34,050 --> 02:23:35,290
Is that so?

3248
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:40,650
Please, I'm embarrassed.

3249
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:41,570
Really?

3250
02:23:42,350 --> 02:23:42,910
Interesting.

3251
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:43,730
Okay.

3252
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:51,350
35 for plus 19 seems pretty good.

3253
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,330
Hmm.

3254
02:23:59,350 --> 02:24:00,530
Now it's plus 17.

3255
02:24:00,530 --> 02:24:01,190
What happened?

3256
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,440
Let's try again.

3257
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:08,420
Oh, shoot.

3258
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,880
Uh, this is not good.

3259
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:11,240
Remarkable.

3260
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:12,940
Not funny.

3261
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:13,780
Not even a little.

3262
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,000
What a wonderful...

3263
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:15,680
Oh, please.

3264
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:18,260
Ugh.

3265
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:24,740
No, you do me too much honor.

3266
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:26,700
What a great story.

3267
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:28,260
You should be ashamed.

3268
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:29,040
Oh, please.

3269
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:30,120
I'm not getting anywhere.

3270
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,380
Oh, dang.

3271
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:32,960
Oh, here we go.

3272
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:34,300
That's...

3273
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:35,120
Oh, please.

3274
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:35,780
Oh, no.

3275
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:36,680
Oh, no.

3276
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,020
No.

3277
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:42,600
That was the best I could have done, I think.

3278
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,860
Oh, please.

3279
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,800
Oh, please.

3280
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:50,340
It's less effective, the higher their affection is.

3281
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:50,800
I see.

3282
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:53,300
Maybe I should have gone for it first then, huh?

3283
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,460
We're at 50.

3284
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:56,760
Let's see.

3285
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:07,120
Well done.

3286
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:08,440
You should be ashamed.

3287
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:11,920
Ugh.

3288
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:14,760
Um.

3289
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:15,480
Oh, gosh.

3290
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:15,940
Oh, here.

3291
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:17,300
You should be ashamed.

3292
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:17,880
Nice.

3293
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:18,420
Really now.

3294
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:19,780
You're such a charm.

3295
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:20,880
Is that so?

3296
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:21,500
Really?

3297
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:22,740
Interesting.

3298
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:23,300
63.

3299
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,380
63.

3300
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:27,940
What a wonderful compliment.

3301
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:28,860
Oh, gosh.

3302
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:29,720
Oh, shoot.

3303
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:31,020
Remarkable.

3304
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:32,080
You should be ashamed.

3305
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:32,860
Oh, please.

3306
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:34,480
64.

3307
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:35,040
Okay.

3308
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:36,220
Ugh.

3309
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:36,780
Come on.

3310
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,280
Not funny.

3311
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:39,240
Not even a little...

3312
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,260
That's just talk.

3313
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:41,360
No, you...

3314
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:41,980
Remarkable.

3315
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:42,460
70!

3316
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:43,020
70!

3317
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,560
We made it to 70, guys.

3318
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,300
Let's go!

3319
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,620
Minto, they hate your jokes.

3320
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:51,060
It's okay.

3321
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:51,840
Look at...

3322
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,880
He's been smirking this whole way.

3323
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:54,740
He...

3324
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:55,440
He actually...

3325
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:56,300
He's just being too nitty.

3326
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:56,660
You know?

3327
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,720
Shut up, guys.

3328
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:02,280
Don't...

3329
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:03,320
Stop talking about 69.

3330
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:09,900
We have to get to 70.

3331
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,960
Should I try one more time?

3332
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:14,900
I think I should.

3333
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:17,440
Oh, just kidding.

3334
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,080
I can't.

3335
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,880
But I could bribe him.

3336
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:24,560
What a thoughtful gift.

3337
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,500
You're welcome.

3338
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:26,580
Okay.

3339
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,300
I see.

3340
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:27,700
Oops.

3341
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:28,180
Oh.

3342
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:28,800
Yeah.

3343
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,020
Now barter.

3344
02:26:30,660 --> 02:26:32,280
My favorite customer.

3345
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:32,960
Yeah.

3346
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:34,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3347
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:35,040
Okay.

3348
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:37,720
Maybe like 50% of the value.

3349
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:42,100
I like how we're just doing this in front of everybody.

3350
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:43,360
That's so...

3351
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:44,000
That works too.

3352
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,620
I could sell anything that I want, actually.

3353
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:47,620
Now that I think about it.

3354
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:48,780
Because...

3355
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,840
He'll buy it.

3356
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:50,220
You know?

3357
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:52,220
He loves you.

3358
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:52,720
He does.

3359
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:55,200
I'm going to sell this...

3360
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:56,060
This one.

3361
02:26:56,300 --> 02:26:56,980
I don't need it.

3362
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,380
He took it for 50%.

3363
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:02,820
Oh my god.

3364
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:03,660
Oh my god.

3365
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:04,260
Oh my god.

3366
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:04,960
Oh my god.

3367
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:06,000
And all of these.

3368
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:06,500
These were...

3369
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,820
Yeah, I took all of these too.

3370
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:08,280
Yeah, yeah.

3371
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,640
An excellent bargain.

3372
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:15,740
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3373
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,260
I think I should haggle for better.

3374
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:32,720
Um...

3375
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:36,790
I don't even know why I have this.

3376
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:38,870
Oh wait.

3377
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:41,790
This is for potions and stuff, no?

3378
02:27:42,490 --> 02:27:43,430
Uh, let's see.

3379
02:27:44,010 --> 02:27:45,770
Okay, so you guys said to...

3380
02:27:45,770 --> 02:27:46,510
Face...

3381
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:47,750
This one seems good though, no?

3382
02:27:49,090 --> 02:27:50,110
Invisibility on self.

3383
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:51,830
That one I think I'll keep around.

3384
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,140
These ones.

3385
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:57,880
Here we go.

3386
02:27:58,860 --> 02:28:01,520
I can't make that deal, even for you.

3387
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:02,140
Okay.

3388
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:02,920
Okay.

3389
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:06,500
What about 53?

3390
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,520
A fine transaction.

3391
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,580
Yes!

3392
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:14,380
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3393
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:15,820
That's more than I would believe.

3394
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:19,040
You got a great deal there.

3395
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:20,880
That seems a fair price.

3396
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:21,400
Nice.

3397
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:22,900
Nice!

3398
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:27,380
What else do I have that is stolen?

3399
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:29,800
But I haven't been able to sell off.

3400
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:30,160
Let's see.

3401
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:30,860
I have a couple things.

3402
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,600
Did I take this because it was expensive?

3403
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,380
It was a hundred.

3404
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,100
Yeah?

3405
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:48,540
Okay.

3406
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:50,820
That's a fair deal.

3407
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:52,560
Yeah, that's a fair deal.

3408
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:54,720
Let's see.

3409
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:55,380
What else do I got?

3410
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:55,960
That's...

3411
02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:58,300
That's expensive.

3412
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:02,680
I guess I can do it by price.

3413
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:03,000
Let's see.

3414
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:03,360
Okay.

3415
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:10,280
We can sell some of these, I suppose.

3416
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:12,900
Fortifying health on self.

3417
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:14,120
Chameleon.

3418
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:15,200
What does chameleon do?

3419
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:18,960
Bronze amulet is stolen.

3420
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:21,240
So is this ring.

3421
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,440
So is this ruby.

3422
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:26,440
Actually, let's get rid of these.

3423
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:29,480
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3424
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:32,400
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3425
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:33,280
I think I grabbed that from the...

3426
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,900
That's more than I'd usually pay.

3427
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:36,600
He loves me.

3428
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:37,540
He loves me.

3429
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:40,820
Don't sell the statue.

3430
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:41,440
No, no, no.

3431
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,220
Yeah, I didn't plant the...

3432
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:44,140
This one, right?

3433
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:44,600
No, no.

3434
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:46,620
I didn't want to sell it.

3435
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:52,710
Anything else stolen?

3436
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:55,810
Oh, here we go.

3437
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:56,650
Bronze amulet.

3438
02:29:57,150 --> 02:29:58,790
That's more than I'd usually pay.

3439
02:29:58,790 --> 02:29:59,630
I'll sell this too.

3440
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:03,810
Weakness to disease.

3441
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:08,130
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3442
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:09,430
I'll sell this one too.

3443
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:11,410
Yeah, I do, buddy.

3444
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:12,370
Yeah, I do.

3445
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:13,530
I've been...

3446
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:16,310
I've been taking so much stuff.

3447
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:18,110
Got anything else?

3448
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:19,770
My repair hammers I can use.

3449
02:30:20,010 --> 02:30:20,750
We'll get rid of the wall.

3450
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:23,750
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3451
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:25,330
Got anything else?

3452
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:29,730
House upper wall hangings.

3453
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:31,410
Well, that's not even worth anything.

3454
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:35,450
Gee, you sure you can handle easy lock?

3455
02:30:37,950 --> 02:30:39,010
Chainmail is so heavy.

3456
02:30:40,230 --> 02:30:41,410
Chainmail is not so heavy.

3457
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:42,570
Let's see.

3458
02:30:42,730 --> 02:30:43,950
What's the heaviest thing we got?

3459
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:44,870
Don't say chainmail.

3460
02:30:48,010 --> 02:30:48,850
It's like...

3461
02:30:48,850 --> 02:30:50,210
It's okay heavy.

3462
02:30:50,830 --> 02:30:52,230
It's not so bad, actually.

3463
02:30:53,150 --> 02:30:55,890
I feel like I can sell a lot of these clothes, can't I?

3464
02:30:57,250 --> 02:31:00,690
Chameleon is invisibility that doesn't break when you attack or pick up or interact.

3465
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:01,250
It's very good.

3466
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:02,690
Basically, like passive stealth.

3467
02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:05,710
And at 100, you can't ever be seen by anyone.

3468
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:06,970
Oh, I see.

3469
02:31:09,950 --> 02:31:11,390
Let's sell some of our clothes.

3470
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:16,670
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3471
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:17,970
My fur don't much.

3472
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:26,630
What's a snowball tone?

3473
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:28,110
I don't remember.

3474
02:31:34,420 --> 02:31:35,940
We're at 22.

3475
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:39,160
Where's the chainmail?

3476
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:39,880
I'll sell it.

3477
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:40,840
I just don't know where it is.

3478
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:42,620
Chainmail.

3479
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:44,960
Chainmail.

3480
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,080
Chainmail.

3481
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:46,960
My greaves.

3482
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:48,040
Goodbye.

3483
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:51,380
I think I can move this item for you at that price.

3484
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:51,720
Goodbye.

3485
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,220
My gauntlets.

3486
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:54,000
Goodbye.

3487
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:55,380
That's a good deal.

3488
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:56,100
Thank you.

3489
02:31:58,440 --> 02:31:59,040
Hmm.

3490
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:05,060
I don't even know what I'm wearing right now.

3491
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,420
I don't even know.

3492
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:10,040
What's a Harada?

3493
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:12,080
List of death.

3494
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:14,360
Hmm.

3495
02:32:23,430 --> 02:32:25,270
He is the guy who made Tekken.

3496
02:32:28,250 --> 02:32:29,730
You're so right.

3497
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:31,710
You are so right.

3498
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:38,770
I'm gonna sell this steel short sword because we got the Sufferthorn.

3499
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:43,610
So, I'm gonna sell this.

3500
02:32:45,470 --> 02:32:46,910
Since we got that.

3501
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:59,340
That freed up a lot of our inventory, too.

3502
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:01,140
Almost over a hundred.

3503
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:04,240
Sell, sell, sell.

3504
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:06,440
And now we just need...

3505
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:08,400
We need less than 3,000.

3506
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:12,060
About 2,700.

3507
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,210
And we will be able to buy...

3508
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,500
We will be able to buy...

3509
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:20,760
The house.

3510
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:22,520
I'm glad that's done.

3511
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:23,940
I need a nap.

3512
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:25,580
Do yawn.

3513
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:27,390
Do yawn.

3514
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:29,820
Do yawn.

3515
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:34,020
Rumors?

3516
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:34,760
Poor Arnora.

3517
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:39,820
Seems her boyfriend, Jorunder, has stolen some gold from her and left her penniless.

3518
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:42,820
Now he's in jail and she's destitute.

3519
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,240
He says it so excitedly.

3520
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:48,200
He looks like he's about to lose his hair, too.

3521
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:50,400
Shadow hide you.

3522
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:52,660
We're not hiding from anybody.

3523
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:53,500
Look at all...

3524
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:55,000
All these people are...

3525
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,900
All these people are...

3526
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:57,340
Staring at us.

3527
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:58,160
I've reached my goal.

3528
02:33:58,300 --> 02:33:59,900
I've fenced over 50 gold worth of goods.

3529
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:01,520
I should go and see Arman sometime.

3530
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:02,620
Yes!

3531
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,220
Let's make that my active voice.

3532
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,120
Hi.

3533
02:34:07,660 --> 02:34:08,720
I'm Olga.

3534
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:11,740
I'm a bard and a speechcraft trainer.

3535
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,500
Hanmund is my live-in partner.

3536
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:21,180
No offense, but I don't want to hear about any Mara Mother Mild and chapel family business.

3537
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,500
Mara Mother Mild.

3538
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,920
Hanmund and I live together in the old Nord way.

3539
02:34:25,240 --> 02:34:28,660
Good enough for my fa and ma and good enough for me.

3540
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:29,220
Nice.

3541
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:32,600
But using my mint mug is so cute!

3542
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:33,480
Thank you!

3543
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:36,700
Every time I drink right-handed, it lines up...

3544
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:37,620
Stop, don't say that!

3545
02:34:44,430 --> 02:34:45,530
Don't say that!

3546
02:34:46,590 --> 02:34:47,370
You too!

3547
02:34:49,650 --> 02:34:51,190
I get embarrassed too.

3548
02:34:55,310 --> 02:34:57,010
You designed it that way.

3549
02:34:57,010 --> 02:34:58,390
I know, but it's...

3550
02:35:01,250 --> 02:35:02,510
You bit the book!

3551
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:03,670
I know, but...

3552
02:35:07,050 --> 02:35:07,930
It's like...

3553
02:35:07,930 --> 02:35:09,530
You're supposed to be...

3554
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:11,210
It's supposed to spook you more than anything.

3555
02:35:11,370 --> 02:35:12,350
You're supposed to be like...

3556
02:35:12,350 --> 02:35:15,030
Where did this slip-stick stain come from?

3557
02:35:15,390 --> 02:35:16,870
My house must be haunted!

3558
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:19,950
Like that.

3559
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:29,860
Golly!

3560
02:35:30,360 --> 02:35:31,500
I'm right here!

3561
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:35,040
Greetings!

3562
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,640
What exactly do you require of me?

3563
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:38,120
Nothing.

3564
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:40,740
Actually, I require a bathroom.

3565
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:41,680
I gotta go pee.

3566
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:45,940
You guys, here's some oblivion.

3567
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:47,300
ASMR.

3568
02:35:48,320 --> 02:35:50,820
Watch the people as they people.

3569
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:52,760
Watch them walk.

3570
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:54,400
Watch them live.

3571
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:57,000
Watch them do their little thing.

3572
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:00,220
I'll be right back.

3573
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,100
That'll be a rip-up.

3574
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:36,880
Spin...

3575
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:37,060
Oh!

3576
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:39,320
Spin...

3577
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:42,500
Spin...

3578
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:45,900
Spin...

3579
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:47,420
Well, welcome back.

3580
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:48,060
Thank you!

3581
02:38:49,500 --> 02:38:51,300
What a lovely couple!

3582
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:52,540
Go ahead!

3583
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:53,300
Please!

3584
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:54,420
Of course!

3585
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:59,500
I can't say your name.

3586
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,100
Poor Arnora.

3587
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:06,960
Seems her boyfriend Jirunder has stolen some gold for her and left her penniless.

3588
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:10,180
Now he's in jail and she's destitute.

3589
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:12,680
Why do they all say the same thing?

3590
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:13,300
Goodbye.

3591
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:14,060
Oh.

3592
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:15,060
How are you?

3593
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:16,980
Damn.

3594
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:18,220
I'm sorry for you.

3595
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:20,620
Surrutan, I'm sorry for you.

3596
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:22,520
I'm Surrutan.

3597
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:23,020
Surrutan.

3598
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:24,600
I'm the proud owner of Nova Roma.

3599
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:28,500
A little piece of Heartland Empire here in the Lofty Gerald's.

3600
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,720
I see.

3601
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:31,920
What else?

3602
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:33,700
What are you... are you gonna talk about Nora?

3603
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:36,280
Don't get on Jaskar's bad side.

3604
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:39,320
You'll likely get a fireball in your face for your troubles.

3605
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:39,780
Whoa.

3606
02:39:41,380 --> 02:39:42,600
Uh, Jirunder.

3607
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:45,460
Our Nora and Jirunder were once a happy couple.

3608
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:47,540
The whole town is talking about these two.

3609
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,840
I hear that he took all of their money and stashed it after he committed a robbery.

3610
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:53,440
Wait, where did he stash it?

3611
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:57,660
He was going to skip town on our Nora, but got arrested before making good on his escape.

3612
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:00,360
Now she has no money left at all.

3613
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:01,320
Poor thing.

3614
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:02,480
Is she destitute?

3615
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:03,340
Is she sa...

3616
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:04,960
Oh, two sides of the coin.

3617
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,520
Take care.

3618
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:06,720
Wait, what is this?

3619
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:12,760
So I realize, guys, one of my meetings is in 20 minutes.

3620
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:17,100
So I might have to call it soon.

3621
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:23,580
Though I want to go to the thieves first.

3622
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:30,200
I heard that Nora of Bruma is looking for some help recovering some money.

3623
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:33,580
Oh, I need the money, actually.

3624
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:37,200
So yeah, I need the money more than...

3625
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:37,920
Wait, what is that?

3626
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:44,600
Where spirits have lease.

3627
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:46,200
Oh

3628
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:52,820
yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

3629
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:55,380
So let's go to the thieves.

3630
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:00,770
Wait, what is this?

3631
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,710
Here.

3632
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:15,210
Even in a fantasy world, we can't afford a mortgage.

3633
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:19,750
Unfortunately, I, you know, as a ghost...

3634
02:41:20,390 --> 02:41:20,690
Okay.

3635
02:41:21,470 --> 02:41:23,130
So it's kind of complicated.

3636
02:41:23,490 --> 02:41:25,590
Like, I can choose wherever I want to haunt.

3637
02:41:25,810 --> 02:41:27,370
As long as it's not being...

3638
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:29,750
Rent haunted by...

3639
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:32,630
Someone else, you know?

3640
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:36,230
But at the same time...

3641
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:38,450
Puny.

3642
02:41:38,830 --> 02:41:39,770
You know, it's like...

3643
02:41:42,190 --> 02:41:43,410
There's also rent.

3644
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:46,250
But it's also easier to find.

3645
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:49,850
No, I could just pick, like, anywhere that I want to haunt.

3646
02:41:53,290 --> 02:41:54,670
I'm glad you stopped by.

3647
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:57,890
I have a situation that you might be able to help with.

3648
02:41:57,890 --> 02:41:58,610
A situation, eh?

3649
02:42:02,410 --> 02:42:03,130
What's that?

3650
02:42:05,050 --> 02:42:08,230
The gray fox has asked me to take care of a problem.

3651
02:42:08,470 --> 02:42:09,270
You need the money?

3652
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:10,530
I'm putting you on it.

3653
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:15,610
Hieronymus Lex actually collected taxes from everyone living here on the waterfront.

3654
02:42:16,250 --> 02:42:18,210
Your job is to recover those taxes.

3655
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:19,730
Are you up for it?

3656
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:20,630
Yes.

3657
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:25,710
Who's Hieronymus Lex?

3658
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:29,170
He is a fool of a captain in the Imperial Watch.

3659
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:31,130
He's a real law and order type.

3660
02:42:31,270 --> 02:42:34,390
Oh yeah, I forgot the Thieves Guild are like Robin Hood people.

3661
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:37,870
That's why I like being with the Brotherhood.

3662
02:42:38,710 --> 02:42:42,490
The gray fox has led our guild for over 300 years now.

3663
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:46,570
He has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront.

3664
02:42:48,590 --> 02:42:49,630
Sure, I'll do it.

3665
02:42:49,870 --> 02:42:50,050
Good.

3666
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:52,930
Find out where he's keeping the taxes and bring them to me.

3667
02:42:53,510 --> 02:42:57,230
I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it.

3668
02:42:57,230 --> 02:42:58,610
Okay, cool.

3669
02:42:59,670 --> 02:43:00,850
Untaxing the poor.

3670
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:04,130
Shadowhide you.

3671
02:43:05,370 --> 02:43:06,230
This way.

3672
02:43:10,810 --> 02:43:11,970
He's keeping it.

3673
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:12,890
The chapel attacked.

3674
02:43:13,490 --> 02:43:14,090
Now...

3675
02:43:14,090 --> 02:43:15,130
Oh my god!

3676
02:43:15,330 --> 02:43:16,290
...take yourself here the first time.

3677
02:43:16,530 --> 02:43:19,710
If you get near that ship, you'll end up dead.

3678
02:43:19,710 --> 02:43:21,290
I didn't even talk to you!

3679
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:22,950
You came up to me!

3680
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:23,470
Sure.

3681
02:43:23,470 --> 02:43:25,630
Have you heard any word about the other problem?

3682
02:43:25,830 --> 02:43:25,930
Oh my gosh!

3683
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:28,510
We're getting jump scared left and right.

3684
02:43:31,010 --> 02:43:32,090
She's so blue.

3685
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:33,550
That's how I like him, baby.

3686
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:53,360
Over here?

3687
02:43:59,130 --> 02:43:59,610
Trends?

3688
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:01,050
No.

3689
02:44:01,850 --> 02:44:02,610
Where am I?

3690
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:08,090
Is it behind?

3691
02:44:08,890 --> 02:44:09,370
Hello.

3692
02:44:10,370 --> 02:44:11,810
I don't want you to listen to me.

3693
02:44:12,770 --> 02:44:13,150
Here.

3694
02:44:14,310 --> 02:44:15,030
Oh.

3695
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:16,170
Oh, wow.

3696
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:19,710
It's not illegal for us to go in here.

3697
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:22,810
Who is the...

3698
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:24,610
Who is the destitute?

3699
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:27,910
Oh my god!

3700
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:29,230
P...

3701
02:44:29,230 --> 02:44:29,550
P?

3702
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:30,270
P?

3703
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:55,170
This direction.

3704
02:44:56,170 --> 02:44:56,970
Over here?

3705
02:44:57,630 --> 02:44:58,670
What is it, citizen?

3706
02:44:58,670 --> 02:44:59,070
Oh my goodness.

3707
02:44:59,230 --> 02:45:00,490
We're heading all over the place.

3708
02:45:05,210 --> 02:45:05,710
P?

3709
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:08,010
Don't miss your meeting.

3710
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:08,730
Don't worry.

3711
02:45:11,450 --> 02:45:13,450
Oh, it's taking me to a whole other...

3712
02:45:14,010 --> 02:45:14,950
My horse!

3713
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:21,140
Oh my god!

3714
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:22,960
You've been here the whole time!

3715
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:25,560
Wait.

3716
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:25,740
Wait.

3717
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:28,800
It was taking us all the way out...

3718
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:32,040
Untaxing...

3719
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:33,900
Oh, I was on the wrong thing...

3720
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:34,560
I think.

3721
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:35,440
Oh, come on.

3722
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:41,140
Ah, the wrong quest selected.

3723
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:45,800
Okay.

3724
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:46,740
What is it, citizen?

3725
02:45:47,060 --> 02:45:47,480
Nothing.

3726
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:54,130
I'll go until I can't anymore.

3727
02:45:54,950 --> 02:45:55,830
For playing.

3728
02:45:57,090 --> 02:45:58,250
It's just so much fun.

3729
02:45:59,390 --> 02:46:00,410
I can't stop.

3730
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:02,910
Especially because it's been so long since I played.

3731
02:46:03,810 --> 02:46:05,730
I don't want to play anything off stream.

3732
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:06,610
Maybe, I don't...

3733
02:46:07,770 --> 02:46:08,210
Like...

3734
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:11,810
If you guys are okay with me, like maybe...

3735
02:46:12,270 --> 02:46:12,710
Grinding...

3736
02:46:12,710 --> 02:46:13,590
What's it called?

3737
02:46:14,190 --> 02:46:15,110
Dungeons and stuff.

3738
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:15,670
I don't know.

3739
02:46:16,350 --> 02:46:17,770
I don't know what would be good.

3740
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:20,590
Speak.

3741
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:23,630
They talk to me like I'm a dog.

3742
02:46:27,460 --> 02:46:28,200
Oh, here.

3743
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:36,340
Peek.

3744
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:37,320
What is it, citizen?

3745
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:40,440
What is it, citizen?

3746
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:40,760
Oh.

3747
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:42,260
Oh.

3748
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:43,580
Oh.

3749
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:45,400
Can you guys leave?

3750
02:46:45,660 --> 02:46:46,440
You have my ear.

3751
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:49,560
Can you guys leave?

3752
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:54,760
Save me the quest.

3753
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:56,780
You're the player of my air call.

3754
02:46:57,180 --> 02:46:58,620
Well, I don't want to like...

3755
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:01,300
You guys are missing anything cool off screen.

3756
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:03,100
I don't know.

3757
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:05,660
Speak.

3758
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:09,540
I think there's a guy talking to me from up there.

3759
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:20,360
Okay, they're asleep.

3760
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:21,660
Perfect.

3761
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:36,280
Again?

3762
02:47:36,660 --> 02:47:36,940
Oh.

3763
02:47:37,260 --> 02:47:38,000
Oh my goodness.

3764
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:00,080
Loud root.

3765
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:01,100
Okay.

3766
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:07,080
He's average.

3767
02:48:18,250 --> 02:48:25,090
I think my pickpocketing has gone up.

3768
02:48:28,510 --> 02:48:30,630
I found the tax records.

3769
02:48:31,090 --> 02:48:33,410
Now to get them back to Armand in the waterfront district.

3770
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:38,490
Nobody heard a thing.

3771
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:46,060
I don't know how people sleep with the nerd roots around.

3772
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:48,460
It's actually crazy.

3773
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:54,460
I don't want to get too greedy.

3774
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:55,500
But like...

3775
02:48:55,500 --> 02:48:57,820
What if I just look around a little bit, you know?

3776
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:00,920
I don't want to...

3777
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,200
You know, what if someone comes up here?

3778
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:08,140
Are they gonna notice that I was all the way downstairs?

3779
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:10,300
Or that they went up...

3780
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:11,080
That I went up, you know?

3781
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:12,720
I guess we'll find out.

3782
02:49:18,460 --> 02:49:20,780
They don't even care.

3783
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:25,540
Wait, they don't even care.

3784
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:28,500
Let's go.

3785
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:30,480
In and out.

3786
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,220
Easy peasy.

3787
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:35,460
And I get to finish the quest.

3788
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:44,160
You have my ear.

3789
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:49,360
They're on break.

3790
02:49:49,360 --> 02:49:50,320
They can't be bothered.

3791
02:49:58,310 --> 02:49:59,910
Ear thief.

3792
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:04,770
I stole your ear.

3793
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:06,650
I stole your taxes.

3794
02:50:13,090 --> 02:50:13,810
All right.

3795
02:50:14,590 --> 02:50:15,230
Wait.

3796
02:50:15,810 --> 02:50:16,430
Wait.

3797
02:50:16,990 --> 02:50:18,050
Where are you?

3798
02:50:23,130 --> 02:50:24,590
It's 3 a.m.

3799
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:25,630
Wait.

3800
02:50:26,110 --> 02:50:27,170
Where are you?

3801
02:50:27,630 --> 02:50:28,190
Mister.

3802
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:31,170
Uh...

3803
02:50:31,170 --> 02:50:31,630
Mister?

3804
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:36,170
Oh, he has to be here at midnight.

3805
02:50:36,350 --> 02:50:36,770
That's right.

3806
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:42,830
Okay, I'll just stand here for...

3807
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:47,550
For 20 hours, I guess.

3808
02:50:50,730 --> 02:51:00,570
Oh, he has to be here at midnight.

3809
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:05,560
Gosh, a whole lot of s...

3810
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:06,560
Being a thief is...

3811
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:08,760
Kind of boring work, huh?

3812
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:11,360
Oh my god.

3813
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:12,140
Is that him?

3814
02:51:12,460 --> 02:51:12,640
What?

3815
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:16,660
Have you recovered those taxes?

3816
02:51:17,060 --> 02:51:18,060
Yeah, I did it.

3817
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:19,580
And you were gone, you lazy.

3818
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:23,600
Ah, the gray fox will be very pleased.

3819
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:26,500
We will make sure this gets back to the people.

3820
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:27,860
Gray fox will be pleased?

3821
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:30,240
Can you believe that fool even bothered to collect this ultra sum?

3822
02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:31,040
How much are you gonna pay me?

3823
02:51:31,660 --> 02:51:32,180
Yeah, right?

3824
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:32,780
You can keep it.

3825
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:33,240
Oh.

3826
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:35,600
I merely wanted the watch to know they went too far.

3827
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:38,560
I think it's time to promote you to foot pad.

3828
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:42,100
Congratulations on your new guild rank.

3829
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:45,400
Okay, but how much more are you also giving me for that?

3830
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,340
Any more?

3831
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:51,700
No?

3832
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:53,540
That's it?

3833
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,300
I kept 50 gold and that's it?

3834
02:52:07,380 --> 02:52:11,940
The guild has received a request to obtain a unique statuette.

3835
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:18,040
It is a bust of Laphasa Indaris, the recently slain Countess of Chainhall.

3836
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:19,840
You will be paid a modest sum.

3837
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,440
Thank you for the supertie.

3838
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:20,920
Thank you.

3839
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,160
Do you want this job?

3840
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:23,700
Modest sum.

3841
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:24,420
Yes, I'll take it.

3842
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:24,780
Excellent.

3843
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:26,920
Bring it back to me once you have it.

3844
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:27,500
Okay.

3845
02:52:29,360 --> 02:52:31,140
The elfin maiden.

3846
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:32,840
Shadowhide you.

3847
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:34,540
Crime doesn't pay.

3848
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:37,240
Well, it does in this.

3849
02:52:38,420 --> 02:52:39,620
I've reached my goal.

3850
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:41,840
A fence over 100 golds worth of goods.

3851
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:42,800
I should go see Armand.

3852
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:44,120
Oh, nice.

3853
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:44,440
Yeah.

3854
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:45,600
Good to see you again.

3855
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:46,360
Oh, his head.

3856
02:52:52,860 --> 02:52:53,300
Uh...

3857
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:56,860
If you want luxury, there's nowhere better than the Tiber Septim Hotel.

3858
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,240
Um...

3859
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:04,160
Shadowhide you.

3860
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:06,660
Oh, it's the job I just took.

3861
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:07,280
Okay, okay.

3862
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:09,980
Well, guys...

3863
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:13,800
Uh, will this go away though?

3864
02:53:13,940 --> 02:53:14,560
I wonder.

3865
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:15,780
Hmm.

3866
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:18,400
Because I've already done it.

3867
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:19,740
Hmm.

3868
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:25,580
Huh.

3869
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:27,420
Have a good time in Japan!

3870
02:53:27,800 --> 02:53:31,000
I hope you can get everything you want done and looking forward to see everything you're cooking.

3871
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:32,120
Thanks for your loot!

3872
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:32,760
Thank you!

3873
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,600
Oh, ask about Gray Fox again.

3874
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:36,060
Good to see you again.

3875
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:37,620
All right, and then I have to go.

3876
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:39,100
He's been around for hundreds of years.

3877
02:53:39,100 --> 02:53:39,860
I have to go.

3878
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:41,420
I've heard tell that he is immortal.

3879
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:44,340
I don't know about that, but he sure ain't normal.

3880
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:50,420
Shadowhide you.

3881
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:51,560
Shadowhide you.

3882
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:54,860
Oblivion portals could be good for grinding off stream.

3883
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:57,920
They tend to be very samey and drop good loot.

3884
02:53:57,920 --> 02:53:59,480
Ah, maybe I'll try that then.

3885
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:00,900
Take your door go!

3886
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:01,540
Thank you!

3887
02:54:02,260 --> 02:54:03,280
All right, guys!

3888
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:04,300
This is fun!

3889
02:54:05,380 --> 02:54:06,100
Oh, look!

3890
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:08,740
His head is melting because of the fire.

3891
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:12,520
Oh my gosh, you scared me!

3892
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,200
Puny!

3893
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:19,300
Puny!

3894
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:19,420
Okay.

3895
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:22,060
Thank you, kind lady.

3896
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:23,980
You're gonna get some shoes now, right?

3897
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:30,860
Next time I see you, you better be wearing some shoes, puny.

3898
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:33,080
Puny jump scare.

3899
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:35,000
He looked like he was coming out there to murder me.

3900
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:40,260
But, um, yeah.

3901
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:42,900
I think this was good.

3902
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,440
We made some good progress.

3903
02:54:44,580 --> 02:54:45,360
We killed some people.

3904
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:47,160
We stole from some people.

3905
02:54:47,740 --> 02:54:49,560
My life of crime is...

3906
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:52,150
Gosh, it's...

3907
02:54:53,170 --> 02:54:55,570
I'm dead, but I've never felt so alive.

3908
02:54:56,270 --> 02:54:57,630
Take so thank you!

3909
02:55:01,630 --> 02:55:02,150
Yeah.

3910
02:55:03,150 --> 02:55:04,650
Did lots of crime.

3911
02:55:05,690 --> 02:55:06,850
Lots of crime.

3912
02:55:07,250 --> 02:55:08,690
And next time, for sure.

3913
02:55:09,150 --> 02:55:10,890
We will get my house.

3914
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:13,470
We will get my house for sure.

3915
02:55:13,750 --> 02:55:16,070
And I still gotta kill those other people.

3916
02:55:18,070 --> 02:55:18,830
Actually, though.

3917
02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:20,890
Wait, doesn't that guy pay like a thousand gold?

3918
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:27,070
To kill those three people?

3919
02:55:27,670 --> 02:55:28,150
Wait.

3920
02:55:29,130 --> 02:55:30,570
That's a great one to do.

3921
02:55:31,690 --> 02:55:32,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3922
02:55:33,550 --> 02:55:34,450
We'll do that.

3923
02:55:34,650 --> 02:55:35,370
Yeah, Glarthor.

3924
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:38,410
Taking Glarthor's quest will make you rich.

3925
02:55:38,930 --> 02:55:39,050
Okay.

3926
02:55:39,610 --> 02:55:40,970
Yeah, and then we can rob Glarthor.

3927
02:55:41,070 --> 02:55:41,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3928
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:43,930
Okay, Glarthor, next stream for sure.

3929
02:55:46,390 --> 02:55:50,250
Next stream for sure is Glarthor and the Murderous Pact.

3930
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:52,730
The death list.

3931
02:55:53,430 --> 02:55:54,910
Um, but I gotta get going.

3932
02:55:55,290 --> 02:55:56,970
So, I'm gonna save like I am.

3933
02:55:57,730 --> 02:55:58,930
Let's do a new save.

3934
02:56:01,830 --> 02:56:02,710
And, uh...

3935
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:03,490
Yeah!

3936
02:56:04,390 --> 02:56:05,070
Thank you, guys.

3937
02:56:05,390 --> 02:56:08,490
I'll see you if I see you tomorrow when I collab with...

3938
02:56:10,850 --> 02:56:11,730
With Koyo.

3939
02:56:12,110 --> 02:56:14,810
I don't know yet about stream my POV.

3940
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:15,670
Like I said, it might be...

3941
02:56:16,950 --> 02:56:18,570
Depending on what game we play.

3942
02:56:18,870 --> 02:56:21,210
Because it might be like a one POV kind of thing.

3943
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:23,850
But it's also pretty early for me.

3944
02:56:25,070 --> 02:56:26,590
But of course, I will tweet about it.

3945
02:56:28,990 --> 02:56:30,270
When will you be back?

3946
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:32,030
Uh...

3947
02:56:32,030 --> 02:56:34,510
I will be back June...

3948
02:56:38,490 --> 02:56:38,970
5th?

3949
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:41,510
June 5th.

3950
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:42,170
Yes.

3951
02:56:43,670 --> 02:56:44,370
I think.

3952
02:56:44,590 --> 02:56:45,310
That's when I get back.

3953
02:56:49,670 --> 02:56:52,410
So, this actually might be my last stream until...

3954
02:56:52,410 --> 02:56:53,390
I get back.

3955
02:56:57,970 --> 02:56:59,630
I already miss you guys.

3956
02:57:04,810 --> 02:57:06,530
I already miss you guys.

3957
02:57:07,710 --> 02:57:08,510
But, uh...

3958
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:09,430
It will be...

3959
02:57:09,430 --> 02:57:11,250
It will be very busy for me.

3960
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:14,230
So, I thought about streaming while I was there.

3961
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:15,330
But, honestly...

3962
02:57:16,270 --> 02:57:18,530
Because, originally, I was only having one thing.

3963
02:57:18,670 --> 02:57:19,410
One reason to go.

3964
02:57:19,530 --> 02:57:21,690
And then it turned into a lot more.

3965
02:57:21,690 --> 02:57:25,110
So, I was like, I won't have time to stream.

3966
02:57:28,590 --> 02:57:29,010
Um...

3967
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:29,500
Let me just...

3968
02:57:36,610 --> 02:57:37,310
So, yeah.

3969
02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:38,490
Um...

3970
02:57:38,490 --> 02:57:39,470
So, unfortunately...

3971
02:57:39,470 --> 02:57:40,090
I can't...

3972
02:57:40,090 --> 02:57:41,050
I can't stream while I'm there.

3973
02:57:41,150 --> 02:57:42,330
But, like I said, I'll do some...

3974
02:57:42,330 --> 02:57:44,830
Twitter spaces and things like that.

3975
02:57:45,530 --> 02:57:47,230
Stream's over, but I'll just go here.

3976
02:57:49,650 --> 02:57:50,450
Safe travels.

3977
02:57:50,590 --> 02:57:51,050
Thank you!

3978
02:57:51,570 --> 02:57:52,290
Thank you, thank you.

3979
02:57:52,470 --> 02:57:53,650
Thank you so much, you guys.

3980
02:58:00,190 --> 02:58:01,030
Take care of yourself.

3981
02:58:01,150 --> 02:58:01,850
Thank you, guys.

3982
02:58:03,910 --> 02:58:06,290
I feel like I haven't streamed so much.

3983
02:58:06,310 --> 02:58:07,570
I feel so bad.

3984
02:58:07,850 --> 02:58:09,850
Since I haven't been streaming so much lately.

3985
02:58:12,050 --> 02:58:12,830
Uh...

3986
02:58:12,830 --> 02:58:13,750
I'm sorry.

3987
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:15,390
Uh...

3988
02:58:15,390 --> 02:58:16,230
Uh...

3989
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:16,530
Uh...

3990
02:58:16,530 --> 02:58:16,870
Uh...

3991
02:58:16,870 --> 02:58:17,410
Uh...

3992
02:58:17,410 --> 02:58:17,430
Uh...

3993
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:17,450
Uh...

3994
02:58:18,060 --> 02:58:18,450
Uh...

3995
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:21,430
But, hopefully, it all...

3996
02:58:22,460 --> 02:58:23,070
Pays off.

3997
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:27,010
Don't feel bad.

3998
02:58:27,370 --> 02:58:28,530
I can't help it.

3999
02:58:31,210 --> 02:58:32,730
Literally can't help it.

4000
02:58:35,030 --> 02:58:35,630
Okay.

4001
02:58:37,470 --> 02:58:39,030
But yeah, I gotta get going.

4002
02:58:40,150 --> 02:58:43,130
I will see you guys another day!

4003
02:58:44,350 --> 02:58:45,330
Another day!

4004
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:46,550
I don't know when.

4005
02:58:47,110 --> 02:58:48,350
Unless it's tomorrow.

4006
02:58:51,670 --> 02:58:52,490
See ya.

4007
02:58:52,750 --> 02:58:54,110
Okay, bye-bye.

4008
02:58:54,450 --> 02:58:55,470
Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.

4009
02:58:55,470 --> 02:58:57,170
Until next time!

4010
02:58:57,290 --> 02:58:58,370
See you guys later!

4011
02:58:58,790 --> 02:58:59,550
Bye-bye!

4012
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:00,490
Bye-bye!

4013
02:59:00,530 --> 02:59:01,230
Bye-bye-bye!

4014
02:59:01,470 --> 02:59:02,150
Bye-bye!

4015
02:59:03,730 --> 02:59:04,290
Bye-bye!

4016
02:59:04,290 --> 02:59:04,410
Bye-bye!

4017
02:59:04,430 --> 02:59:04,430
Bye-bye!
