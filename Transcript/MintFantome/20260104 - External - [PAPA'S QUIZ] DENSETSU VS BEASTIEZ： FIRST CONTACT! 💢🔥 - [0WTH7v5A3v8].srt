00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,510
Papa Quiz!

5
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,210
What is Papa Quiz?

6
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,010
I don't know.

7
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,330
We actually don't know.

8
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,610
Not a clue.

9
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,730
It's an amazing game.

10
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,350
Incredible.

11
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,690
You guys are gonna love it.

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,210
I'm excited.

13
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,090
Yeah.

14
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,050
This is a big game.

15
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,650
It's really...

16
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,950
does have a advantage in this game being that it is Vicky's
favorite game.

17
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,190
I mean, we have a person advantage.

18
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,130
Uh, uh, uh, uh, I literally haven't played it like a year,
but okay.

19
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Do we have a person?

20
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,710
Ferry, I don't know what side you're on.

21
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,210
Wait, wait, that's not an advantage.

22
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,690
Trader action.

23
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,570
Trader action.

24
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,470
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

25
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,250
Yeah, I can do it.

26
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:55,550
I can do it.

27
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,310
Wait, wait, wait.

28
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,090
Oh, what about this?

29
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,810
I'm sitting.

30
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,370
I'm sitting.

31
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,170
You look so polite.

32
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,830
She hit the floor.

33
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,990
She hit the floor.

34
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,270
Shorty got low.

35
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:07,970
How is it?

36
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,490
Do you like it?

37
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,250
Is it nice?

38
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,890
The metal chair?

39
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,210
I would like to be on the team that I was supposed to, you
know, I'd like to be on a specific side.

40
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,010
And who's that?

41
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,430
And who's that?

42
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,410
Yeah, who's that?

43
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,430
Okay, wait, let's do a self-introduction.

44
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,870
Wait, hold on, hold on, guys.

45
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,590
Ladies, ladies.

46
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,150
That's not me.

47
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,990
Speaking of, speaking of sides, why don't we start with
introductions from the Densetsu EXE side?

48
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:37,830
BROAM!

49
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:38,950

Uh, in order, oh, which, I don't know what order we're in.

sunset, that's okay.

Especially when-

140
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,840
Once we bring this home, I think that'll solidify us as a
unit again.

141
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,400
Isn't that right?

142
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,960

Crock and Tori, uh, and there was a fourth one.

172

Oh my god, it's over, man.

176
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,840
I'm leaving because of that.

177
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,760
We don't talk about berries.

178
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
No, no, no.

179
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,900

182
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,300
Bugs on your back.

183
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:03,200
But yes, today is the battle of the brain smarts versus the
brain farts in Papa Quiz, where we determine which team has

184
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,320
got the most brain cells of all of us.

185
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,020
Mm-hmm.

186
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:17,620
Although I heard that this game is more of a fast finger
affair than it is like an actual difficult battle of wits.

187
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Yeah.

188
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,260
Oh no.

189
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't think I know what that means.

190
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,760
Also, the fast finger there has the advantage.

191
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,340
All you have to do is fast I'm gonna need a little bit help.

192
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,420
Going right.

193
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,920
Oh, your fast finger.

194
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,420
What?

195
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:34,960
What?

196
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,020
Who is who?

197
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,920
Who is who?

198
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,760
Wait, can we introduce ourselves again?

199
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,820
Oh yeah, you're so right.

200
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,340
We introduce ourselves.

201
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
Speed run.

202
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,400
Why did it turn to arrows?

203
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,140
I see it too.

204
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,100
Lady nut.

205
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
You would be.

206
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,260
That's what would be.

207
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,920
Yay!

208
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,960
Someone kick Lady nut.

209
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,660
Kick Lady nut.

210
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,580

I'm flash flashy.

218
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,600
There's a joke here about flashing if things go south for
the quiz.

219
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,260
Give me a little bit, I'll cook it up.

Tiny flower.

229
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,690
Definitely not a little baby.

230
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,810
Yeah, that was fitting.

231
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,510
So cute.

232
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,490
I'm cosplaying my rat.

233
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,630
Yeah, I'm cosplaying Suki.

234
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,530
Oh, cute!

235
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,090
Aww.

236
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,870
I feel like I remember Suki being a bit cute than that, to
be honest.

237
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,550
But...

238
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,150
The eyes are a little...

239
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,770
Yeah, I must say we are all looking kind of rough.

240
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,570
Maybe.

241
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,390
Speak for yourself, B.A.

242
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,650
Okay, all right, hold on.

243
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,250
First question is beautiful.

244
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,070
Just all love and peace.

245
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,010
Big love wants love and peace.

246
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,830
Big love stands for love, man.

247
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,430
I think you threw out love when you betrayed your team.

248
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,070
That's what I'm saying.

249
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,290
Man.

250
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,630
Maybe I gotta start this game before we kill each other.

251
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,430
We can do it.

252
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,510
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

253
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,910
Oh, oh, oh.

254
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,730

Show me the players.

256
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,230
Oh, we have a bingo board.

257
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,630
There we are.

258
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,730
We spread it.

259
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,730
We have a bingo board.

260
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,390
Miss your beard.

261
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,650
Miss your beard.

262
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,690
Flash flashy.

263
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,030

264
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,470
Yeah.

265
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,390
Go back to the lab.

266
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,090
Yeah, do the worm.

267
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,690
Fat finger.

268
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,390
Yeah.

269
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,410
Tiny flower

270
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,090
We need to choose a category.

271
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,770
Oh god.

272
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,090
All right.

273
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:32,810
It's phone time Everybody tap tap tap on your buttons Game
of Thrones.

274
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,770
Oh god.

275

276
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,030
Oh Food!

277
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,770
Food, I guess!

278
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,350
It's older, man.

279
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,650
It's actual.

280
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,570
Did we even click that?

281
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,750
We just...

282
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,050
Guys, you have to keep clicking for the one you want.

283
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,950
Let's start with the first one.

284
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,390
I can't even see my mouse.

285
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,310
Really?

286
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,970
The more points you get.

287
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,510
But remember that you have to answer correctly too.

288
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,090
Okay.

289
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,330
Come on, kids.

290
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,770
We're on food, right?

291
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,490
Food?

292
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,090
We're just writing food?

293
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,470
Where were tacos invented?

294
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,010
Oh my god.

295
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,730
Oh, I wonder...

296
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,730
if I'm right, but...

297
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,610
Did I even...

298
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,690
Did I even...

299
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,650
Is it just an arrow's butt?

300
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,810
Oh, it's how fast you are.

301
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,050
Which animal is on the fruit loops?

302
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,090
Serial box.

303
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,390
Oh, I got it.

304
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,370
Oh, I got that so good.

305
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,370
I got it.

306
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:24,530
I got it.

307
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:24,770
I got it.

308
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,610
No, bro.

309
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,530
I keep tapping you.

310
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,410
I don't...

311
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,550
I got it!

312
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,450
I got it.

313
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,930
I'm locked in there.

314
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,050
I lift up the TV.

315
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,890
The big love gets so close to the screen, you can't even see
it.

316
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,410
Oh, fuck, I misclicked.

317
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,090
I misclicked.

318
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,350
I misclicked.

319
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,330
I know it's in the eye then.

320
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,510
Oh, yeah.

321
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,290
Wait, I didn't get it?

322
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,970
Oh, wait, I'm blaming the ping.

323
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,990
I was so fast.

324
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,150
The ping, the ping in Asia.

325
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,270
A fruit?

326
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,430
I can't read this fast.

327
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,890

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,490

It's the pink.

332
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,070
I was training.

333
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,870

334
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,910

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,810

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,130
What is that?

372
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,950
I don't know.

373
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,070
I don't know.

374
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,670
I don't know.

375
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,570
I'm guessing.

376
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,310
I got it.

377
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,470
What?

378
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,170
I guess?

379
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,790
I don't want a clue.

380
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,430
I really hope I'm right.

381
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,310
Fuck, I didn't get it.

382
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,610
All right.

383
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,490
Well, it's over.

384
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,410
Guys, don't worry.

385
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,410
I got it.

386
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,110
Big love.

387
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:03,830
Big love.

388
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,410
Big love.

389
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,010
attraction.

390
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,750
Oh god.

391
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,830
It's Big Ben.

392
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,830
Oh, it's the two.

393
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,150
The London Eye.

394
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,670
Oh my god.

395
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,550
Wait, the wheel?

396
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,550
Is it wheel or eye?

397
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,430
No, it's the London Eye.

398
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:14,970
It's the eye.

399
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,410
Oh god, I'm close.

400
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,450
I panicked.

401
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,310
I didn't meet the Brits as much as I can.

402
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,110
This is awful.

403
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,730
Wait, wait.

404
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,770
I panicked.

405
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,810
Wait, where did we go?

406
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,070
We're back.

407
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,730
Wait, I missed a question.

408
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:31,890
It's Cambridge.

409
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,250
I just know it.

410
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,330
I don't know.

411
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,230
I don't know.

412
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,250
I'm trying to be around my soul.

413
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,050
Brightness fancy.

414
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,350
Yes, we're good.

415
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,110
That's over there.

416
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,470
I thought that was so good.

417
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,610
Yeah, baby!

418
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,670
I was right!

419
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,550
I knew it was College of London!

420
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,010
Flashy, my god, you're goaded!

421
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:51,530
London!

422
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,250
London Bridge!

423
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,550
London Bridge!

424
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,910
I already chose London Bridge, I just hope.

425
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,970
I pray.

426
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,050
Is that London?

427
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,690
No, it's Tower Bridge!

428
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,690
It's Tower Bridge!

429
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,570
All the bridges look the same.

430
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,910
I'm bringing it back.

431
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,150
I'm bringing it back.

432
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,510
What is it?

433
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,530
Hello?

434
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,570
What does that mean?

435
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,190
First off.

436
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,410
It's in Tynemouth actually.

437
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,630
Who knows?

438
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,670
It's in Tynemouth.

439
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:22,870
It's in Tynemouth.

440
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,390
I have a 25% chance to get it frame one.

441
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,870
Tynemouth.

442
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,210
Tynemouth.

443
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,730
Oh, that was gone first.

444
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:30,450
Yes!

445
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,610
Oh, my gosh.

446
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,110
You are not real.

447
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,650
Can we talk about how big Vicky and Pia go with the most
British person?

448
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,490
Oh my gosh.

449
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,950
Pia.

450
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,910
Do a British accent.

451
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,670
We could do a really British dance.

452
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,110
Yeah.

453
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:48,950
The banana bounce.

454
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,750
Oh, that's so cute.

455
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,410
Don't even bounce on it.

456
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,590
Wow, so you risk...

457
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,770
I showed it a yellow submarine.

458
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,670
A yellow submarine.

459
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,290
A yellow submarine.

460
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,630
Witness Lady Nut, everyone.

461
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,450
Okay, okay.

462
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,630
OK.

463
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,450
OK, doki.

464
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,710
A new category.

465
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,010
OK, doki, doki.

466
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,290
OK, doki.

467
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,050
Monte, they know the drill.

468
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,730
Tap, tap, tap.

469
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,050
Tap, tap.

470
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:14,950
Okay.

471
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,370
Pokémon!

472
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,090
Rock, walk in!

473
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,310
You better get everything!

474
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,850
It called this the junior?

475
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,650
It called the junior category?

476
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,270
What the hell?

477
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,750
So much fun.

478
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,410
Point fincher.

479
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,630
Oh, I know!

480
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,370
Points!

481
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,630
Okay, okay.

482
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:37,690
Scary.

483
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,070
Pokémon.

484
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,530

This is how I meant to steal from her.

488
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,030
Sabotage.

489
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,950
Her true colors come forward.

490
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,950
I meant to steal from her.

491
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,090
What?

492
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,030
Big love, this is your chance again.

493
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,510
Not me, not me, not me, not me, no me, no me.

494
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,490
What the hell?

495
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,840
Wait, you guys, I'm waiting.

496
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,300
I'm trying to get back to her.

497
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm trying to steal from Vicky.

498
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,580
Very.

499
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,320
Very.

500
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,720
I wasn't even paying attention.

501
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,720
I was so betrayed.

502
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,860
It took me three seconds.

503
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's go!

504
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
The timing is...

505
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
Wait, okay, Tori, look at the timing.

506
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,740
No, not me, not me, not me.

507
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,960
Who's who?

508
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,640
Bad finger.

509
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,220
I'm the last three, the last three.

510
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,980
The beasties are all the very first four.

511
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm Mr. Binn.

512
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,520
Oh no!

513
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,460
You're insane, you're insane, you're insane.

514
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,280
Oh no!

515
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,100
The timing is weird.

516
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,220
Beasties hating you.

517
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm just looking at the screen.

518
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,720
Don't be sad.

519
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,540
Don't be sad, Lady Nod.

520
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,520
Don't be sad.

521
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,200
Lady Love, go ahead and do your dance victory.

522
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,280
Yii!

523
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,800
Yii!

524
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,540
Yo, Gangnam Style!

525
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,580
It's like, oh my god, Gangnam Style!

526
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,080
Oh my god, Gangnam Style!

527
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,000
That's so nice that they let Lady Love do a pity dance.

528
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,780
So nice.

529
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,320
Wow.

530
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,860
Monty Gov. The new category.

531
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
Touch the buttons to move the arrows.

532
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,380
Monty, stop it.

533
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,780
Yes, stop it, Monty.

534
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,740
Stop it.

535
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,500
I don't think I didn't notice how you didn't get first for
any of those Pokemon.

541
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,080
Well, it showed one wild one, and then one, and then the

I didn't know.

545
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,240
I thought we were...

546
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,140
Why were we...

547
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,440
Do we just click when it shows it on the screen?

548
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:37,900
If it shows up, you can.

549
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,220
I mean, the links are the dangers.

550
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,700
But, like, usually it doesn't show up first picture.

551
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,520

753
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,990
That's Michael Jackson.

754
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,710
Wow, that was fun.

755
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,330
Everybody get up and celebrate with some funky moves.

756
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,610
Yeah, funky moves!

757
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,530
Oh yeah!

758
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,490
Oh yeah!

759
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,730
Sorry, I was just clicking buttons.

760
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,990
No funky moves.

761
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,410
It's serious game time.

762
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,870
Back into the game.

763
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:58,170
one point we got one great is that wait wait so it just
matters until the end there i guess so i think that's how

764
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:07,390
unless we unless from this round on we take all of the point
totals i guess all the points are for the timer at the end

765
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:14,610
yeah yeah okay so you just gotta survive to the end to get
your team a point i think that's probably the fairest way

766
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,450
right i think so yeah yeah i'm I'm doing this for my team.

767
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,250
So was that a trial round or did that round count?

768
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,830
Yeah, you know that's that we were learning how to play.

769
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,270
Yeah, that was a warm up.

770
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,630
Yeah, warm up.

771
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,530
That was a warm up round from now on.

772
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,670
Yeah, and Vicky hadn't played in like a year so she didn't
remember how to play.

00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,470
Even though we had a British, a British category.

776

I'm like fake British.

777
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,810

No, I chose the night.

919
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,630
We know this.

920
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,590
It's time for pictures.

921
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,430
Random reveal.

922
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,350
Oh, what's the category again?

923
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,910
Uh, fruits and vegetables.

924
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:25,950
Okay.

925
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,730
Red fruits and veggies.

926
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,770
Yeah, this is me, guys.

927
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,350
What's cooking here?

928
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,130
Oh, sorry.

929
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:34,590
Hello?

930
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,890
Oh, I answered it wrong.

931
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,850
Oh, I don't know.

932
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:39,990
Don't look at me.

933
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,270
Oh.

934
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,390
Dang, I was so close.

935
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,190
Making beats.

936
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,950
I was slow.

937
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,970
It was not very flashy flash.

938
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,270
Win.

939
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,410
Yeah.

940
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,590
You do voice acting for this game?

941
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,950
That sounds like you.

942
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,190
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

943
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,810
I don't know.

944
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,970
Dude, show us the picture.

945
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,550
What is that?

946
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,030
Oh, no.

947
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,270
I chose wrong.

948
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,550
I chose wrong too.

949
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,530
I didn't know, so I clicked the one I didn't know.

950
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,270
Oh, damn it.

951
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,190
Oh, no, it chose right!

952
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,750
I chose right!

953
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,670
What the hell is a rose hip?

954
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,350
Whoa!

955
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,630
Oh, wait, wait!

956
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,770
Why is it got hair?

957
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,290
What fruit is pictured here?

958
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,410
Oh, I know fruit.

959
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:24,850
Oh, oh!

960
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,450
Oh, no, no!

961
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,210
I love this fruit, but it's so hard to eat.

962
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,770
It is pretty hard to eat, but...

963
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,170
Yeah, it is pretty hard to eat it.

964
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,630
It loves...

965
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,930
Oh, yeah.

966
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:36,490
Win.

967
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,770
Oh, yeah.

968
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,070
Oh, yeah.

969
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:39,990
Oh, yeah.

970
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,370
Oh, yeah.

971
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,970
What proof is pictured here?

972
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:45,590
Oh!

973
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,870
Oh!

974
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:47,990
Oh!

975
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,770
I'm in my element!

976
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,130
I'm finally in my element!

977
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,570
Yes!

978
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:55,990
Yes!

979
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:57,930
Yes, Phoebe!

980
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:58,750
Do it!

981
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,270
Oh my god, Phoebe!

982
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,130
You're killing it!

983
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,290
Did you get number one answer for...

984
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,630
Or did you get fastest answer for...

985
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,610
Oh, wait, oh, wait, wait, wait.

986
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:07,530
Oh!

987
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,930
I got it.

988
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,330
Okay.

989
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,540
I love raspberries.

990
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,940
Oh, so good.

991
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,400
It's expensive in Japan.

992
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,320
I can get ten for four dollars.

993
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,360
Oh my god.

994
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,000
That's pretty bad.

995
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,840
They're a decoration more than a fruit.

996
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,200
Tiny flower.

997
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,200
Oh my god.

998
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,760
She earned that.

999
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,160
Super time.

1000
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,100
We're gonna do howling hips.

1001
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:40,620
Oh.

1002
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,080
It's too much for YouTube!

1003
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,340
Too much for YouTube!

1004
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,520
That's too much!

1005
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,620
Oh no, it's not old enough yet.

1006
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,540
You're not old enough.

1007
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,740
No shirt on?

1008
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,820
No shirt on?

1009
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,880
Monty, if I may, I'll choose no problem.

1010
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,080
He's spinning like that.

1011
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,760
He did rotate.

1012
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,500
Monty, they know the drill.

1013
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,020
Rotating.

1014
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,260
We know Monty.

1015
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,000
We know.

1016
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,760
Oh no.

1017
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,280
No not.

1018
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,260
It's not the Bible priest.

1019
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,220
These are all bad.

1020
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,240
It's back to the Franco-Belgian comics, yeah.

1021
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,140
Oh, I recognize it though, now they saw the picture.

1022
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,240
It's Chin-Tin.

1023
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,320
Or Tantan.

1024
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,460
Tantan in Japan, did you guys know that?

1025
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,540
Because they can't say Tintin.

1026
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,880
They can't say Tintin for reasons.

1027
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,440
So it's Tantan.

1028
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,820
Famous characters.

1029
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,640
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,500
What is the name of May's big neighbor?

1031
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh!

1032
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,060
Oh!

1033
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,220
Oh!

1034
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,820
Oh!

1035
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:40,920
Oh!

1036
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,720
Fuck, I clicked the wrong thing.

1037
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,880
I went for a picture.

1038
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,880
I thought it was the picture.

1039
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,620
I swear I know it.

1040
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,380
I swear.

1041
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,520
Mr. Beard, lock in.

1042
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,140
Wait, wait, wait.

1043
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,280
I'm going in.

1044
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,920
I'm going in.

1045
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Hold on.

1046
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:55,900
I'm locked out.

1047
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,160
It's always big love.

1048
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,080
Alright.

1049
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,140
I know.

1050
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:00,640
Oh!

1051
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,620
Oh!

1052
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,140
Maybe.

1053
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,540
She's gonna do that.

1054
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,240
Yeah, see, I got you.

1055
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,700
It was a nice moment of...

1056
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,380
Well burp.

1057
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,860
Nice, nice, nice.

1058
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,720
I read that in school and I cried.

1059
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,300
Oh, it's me, baby!

1060
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,440
Take it back.

1061
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,540
Don't do it, don't do it.

1062
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,260
Show big love whose balls.

1063
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:27,880
Yes!

1064
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,380
Yeah!

1065
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,760
Yeah, give me your butt.

1066
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,240
Yeah.

1067
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,660
Which puppet's nose grows every time he tells a lie.

1068
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,020
Oh, easy.

1069
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,160
My ping, my ping.

1070
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,780
My ping!

1071
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,320
My ping!

1072
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,200
How are you so fast?

1073
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,760
Who would you like to steam for?

1074
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,920
You want to have your finger on the mouse.

1075
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,140
Don't do it.

1076
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,780
Don't do it.

1077
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,200
Hold on.

1078
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
I'm looking okay.

1079
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,340
Captain Loco.

1080
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,860
Do flash flashy.

1081
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,600
Flash flashy.

1082
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,120
Flash flashy alone.

1083
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,480
The same 300 points.

1084
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,760
The same 300 points.

1085
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,860
We're passing it around.

1086
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,000
I spit on those.

1087
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,720
Lady Nut.

1088
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,160
How could you get...

1089
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,700
Lady Nut.

1090
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,700
Oh my god!

1091
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,460
I put an answer to everything right!

1092
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:14,940
Oof!

1093
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,140
You got aimed!

1094
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,000
That makes me angry because we are hot head!

1095
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,580
Hot everything else too!

1096
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,440
Oh my god!

1097
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,960
Oh my god!

1098
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,300
Oh my god!

1099
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,640
I don't know how you die.

1100
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,480
Okie dokie.

1101
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,020
I give you fire and you give me okie dokie.

1102
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,680
Okie dokie.

1103
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,400
Okie dokie.

1104
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,060
All right.

1105
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,040
No, absolutely not US president.

1106
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,400
No, get out of it.

1107
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:37,740
Oh no.

1290
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:37,940
Oh no.

1291
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,680
Oh no, I'm still in it.

1292
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,260
I'm still in it.

1293
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:39,740
I'm still in it.

1294
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,580
She does action moves.

1295
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,080
Go to the Fed.

1296
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,580
I have to.

1297
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,940
I have no time.

1298
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,700
Oh my god.

1299
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,020
Oh my god.

1300
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,440
Go on.

1301
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,860
Lady Nugue.

1302
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,260
The U .S.

1303
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,980
Presidents were an only child.

1304
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,660
What?

1305
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,000
Two of them.

1306
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,540
Two of them.

1307
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:54,600
No!

1308
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:54,960
Zero!

1309
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,120
What does that mean?

1310
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:00,700
You can't really.

1311
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,400
You can't really be an only child.

1312
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:02,820
Yeah.

1313
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,800
Lady Nugue!

1314
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:04,860
Lady Nugue.

1315
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,780
Jennifer, Jennifer.

1316
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,420
Not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not.

1317
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:12,440
Lady Nut.

1318
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,740
I ain't cheering that.

1319
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,380
Yeah, yeah, I'm saying that.

1320
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,980
I'm gonna do it with the shaky shake.

1321
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,420
The shake and shake.

1322
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,280
I was very close.

1323
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:21,940
I should have known.

1324
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,500
Oh my gosh, shake those boobies.

1325
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,020
Oh my gosh.

1326
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,000
We're like shaking them in tiny flowers.

1327
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,040
Traumatized.

1328
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,340
You're shaking them in your face.

1329
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,460
Wow.

1330
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,820
It was fun.

1331
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,780
Everybody get up and celebrate with some funky moves.

1332
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,500
Congrats, Beastie.

1333
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,780
That's one point.

1334
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,140
You can go to buffers.tv on your phone and enter the phone.

1335
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:49,880
Wait, it reset.

1336
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh, it reset.

1337
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,300
Why did it reset?

1338
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,240
Oh, no.

1339
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,080
Oh, what reset?

1340
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,300
My character.

1341
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,760
Mine did too.

1342
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,460
Oh, I don't see your characters.

1343
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,160
Yeah, we're not in yet.

1344
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,020
Because what the hell?

1345
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,580
Front row.

1346
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,240
Front row.

1347
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,480
That seems weird.

1348
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,240
Well, sorry.

1349
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,100
Both Mint and Phoebe.

1350
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,080
Beasties, what are you up to?

1351
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,620
This seems like some sabotage.

1352
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,080
Yeah.

1353
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,580
I click my kick Densetsu button.

1354
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,540
Densetsu button.

1355
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,540
I feel like I need to change my name to something a little
more.

1356
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,680
Like, is it menacing?

1357
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,940
Yeah, you gotta evolve and power up.

1358
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,340
I don't even see you guys in here.

1359
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,480
I don't know why.

1360
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,060
I made my character.

1361
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,160
What does it mean?

1362
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,800
Oh yeah, wait, we're not in anymore.

1363
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,440
Yeah, we're not in.

1364
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:40,800
What?

1365
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,600
There you go.

1366
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,060
Crazy cow.

1367
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,660
Someone joined.

1368
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,540
Wait, who's that?

1369
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,240
That one is me.

1370
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,300
Oh, okay.

1371
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay.

1372
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:49,500
Okay.

1373
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,480
Why haven't I joined that?

1374
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,920
I had to like go back and refresh and do it again.

1375
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:54,580
Yeah.

1376
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,360
Maybe refresh.

1377
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,280
Ah, that makes sense.

1378
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,460
Oh my god.

1379
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,320
What the hell?

1380
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,260
That's kind of mean.

1381
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,620
That's fine.

1382
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,140
That's true.

1383
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,820
That's true.

1384
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,220
That's you now.

1385
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,760
I think I'm gonna be Uncle Flower now.

1386
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,820
Oh, good job.

1387
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,920
Uncle Flower.

1388
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,260
I don't know like that.

1389
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,660
Uncle Flower is a bib.

1390
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,880
Just a reminder of who the names are, I am Lady Nutt.

1391
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,900
I'm Mr. Beard.

1392
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,960
I'm such a fork.

1393
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,060
Hell yeah.

1394
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,220
I'm big love.

1395
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,780
Down with big love.

1396
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,600
I'm big hate.

1397
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,640
Also, I've got to pee.

1398
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,020
Can I be right back?

1399
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,600
Yes, girl.

1400
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,440
I thought I could hold it this time.

1401
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,980
I'm sorry.

1402
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,360
You're good.

1403
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,740
You're good.

1404
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,220
Don't worry.

1405
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:43,620
You know what?

1406
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,900
Actually, this is a great time for a slime drape.

1407
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,280
Everybody should hide it.

1408
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,340
Everybody hide it.

1409
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1410
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,200
I was going to say good.

1411
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,000
Here's a...

1412
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,080
I was going to say good time for some trash talk, but...

1413
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,580
Oh, yeah, yeah, trash talk.

1414
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,080
Well, here's some fun facts.

1415
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,060
Now that I'm hydrated, uh, Dead Sets are Stinks, boom.

1416
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,600
Oh, my God.

1417
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,180
Did you actually know that... Wait, who is that?

1418
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,580
Who's Lord Dude?

1419
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,560
Who is that?

1420
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,280
Is that Stainer?

1421
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,000
Who is that?

1422
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,560
Did someone join on their PC and their Wait, who is that?

1423
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,540
Who is that?

1424
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,700
We should just let them join.

1425
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,560
I think this is just a random.

1426
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,560
They could be the fourth Densetsu member.

1427
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,660
There is no chat.

1428
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,020
Wait, the code's not even public.

1429
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,860
Yeah, how do they join?

1430
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:32,640
I don't know.

1431
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,820
Lord Dude.

1432
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,860
Why is Lord Dude looking at us?

1433
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,620
Wait, they're controlling.

1434
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,360
Lord Fingers.

1435
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,420
That's their manager.

1436
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:41,660
That's their manager.

1437
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,040
That's their manager.

1438
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,580
He's come to pat out the rings.

1439
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,520
But how did Starter know the code?

1440
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,080
Yeah, he doesn't know the code.

1441
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,060
I don't know.

1442
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,280
I think someone joined twice.

1443
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:52,380
Oh.

1444
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,200
Oh, maybe.

1445
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,080
Wait.

1446
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,260
But they're like changing things.

1447
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,360
They're changing their name.

1448
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,220
What if it's, what if it's Phoebe on the toilet?

1449
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,140
Well, oh, maybe.

1450
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,500

Okay.

1492
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,900
Why is this TikTok?

1493
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,200
This is just a song.

1494
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,040
It's just a song.

1495
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,840
Yeah, what is this?

1496
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:23,880
Oh.

1497
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,140
What?

1498
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,100
What is this?

1499
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,260
Oh, she wanted to party all night.

01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,140
Okay, sorry guys.

1501
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,240
That's what I thought too.

1502
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,160
Oh, that's what I thought too.

1503
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,780
Oh, oh, shoot.

1504
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:37,760
Okay.

1505
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,120
Oh, my God.

1506
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,040
I saw ghost and I locked in.

1507
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,580
You gotta represent.

1508
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:49,480
Respectable.

1509
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:51,860
Nice, nice.

1510
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,040
The way Lord Fanger is actually playing.

1511
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,220
Oh god.

1512
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,140
Wait, who is this?

1513
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,260
Oh no, I saw the wrong one.

1514
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,100
I clicked the wrong one because of the license.

1515
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:04,680
Wait, who is it?

1516
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,060
I don't know who these people are, but I got them.

1517
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,380
Yes!

1518
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,340
So you're telling me a kid would know the answers to this
better than we.

1519
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,180
I think a kid would.

1520
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,280
I think so.

1521
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,440
Oh, wait, what happens on TikTok when Black?

1522
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,040
What happens?

1523
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:18,900
What's the song?

1524
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,020
I don't know.

1525
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,340
I don't know I should have known Barry.

1526
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,060
I should have known.

1527
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:28,780
It wouldn't make sense.

1528
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,680
Am I the only one who got it?

1529
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:32,980
Am I older?

1530
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,860
Can they have a slogan?

1531
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,220
I don't know.

1532
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:38,400
What?

1533
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,920
Dude, I don't even like put one in.

1534
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,060
Second counts vine?

1535
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,420
Oh, okay.

1536
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,120
Like every second.

1537
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,180
That makes sense, though.

1538
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,440
That one makes sense, yeah.

1539
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,760
Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,540
Oh yeah.

1541
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,300
Awesome nest!

1542
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,600
This is my new vocal stance.

1543
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:54,460
I know.

1544
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,320
Flashy, you've got the most points.

1545
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,120
Yeah, of course you did.

1546
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,280
Yeah, of course you did.

1547
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,420
You got a lot of points.

1548
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,940
Warfinger, what the hell?

1549
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,780
I got you with a jazzy jump.

1550
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:07,760
Whoa.

1551
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,400
Oh, fancy.

1552
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,960
She's riding a unicycle.

1553
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,580
Oh my god.

1554
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,960
I'm a mime in another life.

1555
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,780
Oh, that's beautiful.

1556
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,680
That music is so old.

1557
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,600
Epic dance.

1558
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,440
Epic dance.

1559
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,160
Tap the buttons to move the arrow.

1560
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,860
Tap, tap, tap to choose a category.

1561
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:29,520
All right.

1562
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,420
I'm ready to fight.

1563
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,580
Okie dokie.

1564
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,220
What we got.

1565
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,080
Do you know New Zealand?

1566
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,140
No, we do not know New Zealand.

1567
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,400
We might know.

1568
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:47,900
question that's not a category you've never heard of it the
question is just yes or no and then they move on to the next

1569
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:57,860
round random reveal press a button when you know what the
picture is okay quickly okay okay this is gonna make me

1571
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,820
okay oh easiest question in my life that was really hard
oops please don't say Wait, I think it's a clementine.

1572
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:12,560
It's a mandarin.

1573
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,000
It's a tiny.

1574
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,140
What's the difference?

1575
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,200
I never know.

1576
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,120
Manderins are tiny.

1577
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,600
They're so good.

1578
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,260
Aren't clementines tiny?

1579
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,620
I thought they were like more yellow.

1580
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,640
What's a stone?

1581
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,720
What is a stone fruit?

1582
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,960
Oh, wait.

1583
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,080
Oh, okay.

1584
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,780
That makes sense.

1585
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:33,820
A fruit with a stoning.

1586
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,260
How does it make sense?

1587
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,400
It's not a stone.

1588
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,320
It comes from a stone.

1589
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,960
Which fruit has rocks in it?

1590
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,420
Yeah, what does that mean?

1591
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,540
Yeah, what's a stone?

1592
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,140
Don't mangoes grow on trees?

1593
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,160
Wait, I don't want to answer that.

1594
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,440
If that's stupid, don't answer.

1595
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,500
Wait, what?

1596
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,160
What is it?

1597
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,040
I'm just going to start putting stuff.

1598
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,160
What is that?

1599
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,560
I'm just asking, but I don't...

1600
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,400
It's an apple.

1601
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,000
It's an apple.

1602
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,880
Oh, God!

1603
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,760
Oh!

1604
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,360
What the heck?

1605
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,100
I was assuming it was from somewhere like, I don't know,
European.

1606
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,780
It was blended by Johnny Appleseed.

1607
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:20,740
Yeah!

1608
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,560
Yeah, right?

1609
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,020
Wait, there's too many, there's too much variation in these.

1610
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,200
There's either 12 or 60,000.

1611
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,580
That seems like a lot.

1612
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,860
What the...

1613
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:33,920
Uh...

1614
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,880
Of just the payer?

1615
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,820
3,000!

1616
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,300
What?

1617
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,940
That's a lot of proof.

1618
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,720
I know my pair trivia.

1619
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,120
It's almost more likely so does Lord Finger.

1620
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,120
Let's go Lord Finger.

1621
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,460
He's kind of doing bad, I'll be honest.

1622
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,940
Lord Finger, pick up the pace, dude.

1623
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,680
Dude, you're letting the people down.

1624
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,680
You have less than him, please.

1625
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,480
Hey, hey!

1626
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,260
Hey!

1627
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,120
Yeah, dude.

1628
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,520
Stop coming after our teammate, isn't it?

1629
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,520
Yeah!

1630
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,260
Mr. Beard, you got the most points.

1631
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,240
Mr. Beard!

1632
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,060
Mr. Beard feels like dancing.

1633
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,780
That's a lot of varieties of mirrors.

1634
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,800
Why is Skip Dance in Red?

1635
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,720
For a lot of, for like, a mid-tier fruit.

1636
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,540
Oh, yeah.

1637
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,680
Oh, yeah.

1638
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,160
Oh, yeah.

1639
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:28,740
Oh, yeah.

1640
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh, yeah.

1641
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,600
Oh, it's like a skipping...

1642
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,400
Oh, yeah.

1643
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,060
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:34,560
Oh, yeah.

1645
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,700
I thought it was like a graphic.

1646
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,100
A new category?

1647
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:49,080
the buttons to move the arrow you get ejected if you skip
tap tap tap tap we know ah

1666
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,220
We were like nine people.

1667
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,100
Three sections.

1668
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,000

Guys, I'm out of it.

1692
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,640
My dad walked into the room.

1693
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,380
My controller stopped working.

1694
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,340
No, no, no, no.

1695
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,100
What's Lord Finger gonna do?

1696
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,780
What's Lord Finger doing?

1697
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,860
Lord Finger, we will avenge you.

1698
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,040
We will avenge you, Lord Finger.

1699
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:58,820
Oh.

1700
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,200
Okay.

1701
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,980
Oh, he's angry.

1702
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,600
He's angry.

1703
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,080
Okay.

1704
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,460
Oh my god.

1705
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,460
Lord Finger can get down.

1706
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,740
Monty, you could learn some moves from that.

1707
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,880
Monty.

1708
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:14,840
Monty.

1709
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,620

1711
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:17,280
Oh, wow.

1712
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,880
Monty, stop it.

1713
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,440
They know how to tap.

1714
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,740
Why is he so muted?

1715
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,360
Um, aquatic animals!

1716
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:28,680

Yeah, I was trying to.

1721
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,320
My little pony.

1722
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,780
I don't know how to choose.

1723
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,940
Try to get some big points before the next and final round.

1724
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,000
The Oshimark spam with the chest.

1725
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,380
I know.

1726
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,140
It is so funny.

1727
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,780
Crown finger up.

1728
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,060
Aquatic animals.

1729
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:52,660
Okay.

1730
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,460
Which animal lacks a brain and heart?

1731
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Nice.

1740
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,780

Wait, Lord Finger, what the hell, man?

1742
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,340
That's the most dangerous feature.

1743
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,240
Characterized by male pregnancy.

1744
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:20,980
Oh!

1745
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,300

Everyone got it.

1763
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,500
There's a girlfriend.

1764
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,040
Nicknamed Seekam.

1765
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,700
Oh, I fat fingered it.

1766
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,600

Stupid.

1775
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,200
What does that mean?

1776
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:16,860
I don't know.

1777
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,220
Was it that one?

1778

01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,780
Yes, go Lord Finger!

1833
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,060
Oh my god.

1834
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,100
I'm going.

1835
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:25,980
Oh.

1836
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,660
What was the cover name for D-Day?

1837
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:30,840
Oh, shh.

1838
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,400
Uh, brr.

1839
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,240
Wait, isn't it Omaha?

1840
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,320
Oh, no.

1841
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,580
Oh, shh.

1842
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,200
Yeah!

1843
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,020
It's over.

1844
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,580
It's over.

1845
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,780
Mr. Beer's over.

1846
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,800
Mr. Beer's over too.

1847
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,240
It's over.

1848
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,800
Come on, Minto and Lord Finger, you can do it.

1849
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:52,940
You can do it!

1850
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,480
Which event awards the Borgwana trophy.

1851
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,020
What is that?

1852
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,420
What the fuck?

1853
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,060
I don't know.

1854
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,100
I just picked that.

1855
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,500
I don't know.

1856
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:02,960
Oh, damn.

1857
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:03,860
Oh, no!

1858
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,640
Lord Finger is fucking cheating.

1859
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:07,640
Yes, Lord Finger!

1860
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,620
Oh, my God!

1861
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,380
Lord Finger!

1862
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,900
No way, yeah.

1863
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,120
Yeah!

1864
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,580
Where was the first recipe for potato chips?

1865
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,040
There's no way he sandbagged this entire time.

1866
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:19,660
Oh!

1867
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,040
Oh!

1868
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,920
Oh, I know this one.

1869
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:21,400
I know this one.

1870
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,160
I don't know this one.

1871
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:22,520
Oh, shit.

1872
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,300
We got this lady nut.

1873
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,460
Oh, wait, I got it!

1874
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:27,860
I got it!

1875
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,360
Oh, yeah!

1876
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,340
Oh, we're cooked.

1877
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:31,920
We're cooked.

1878
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:32,760
Oh, no.

1879
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:33,680
The next one.

1880
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:34,020
The next one.

1881
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:34,480
Legend of Zelda.

1882
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,460
Oh, wait.

1883
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:35,800
Come on.

1884
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:36,540
You got this one.

1885
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,700
Which is a recurring legendary weapon in the Zelda series.

1886
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:40,100
Oh.

1887
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,820
No, no, no, no, no, you know this one.

1888
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,480
The buster sword!

1889
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,380
The buster sword!

1890
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,560
The buster sword!

1891
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,140
Everyone's got that.

1892
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,980
Everyone's got that.

1893
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,180
Kings and queens.

1894
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,240
Okay, Mickey whispered to me right here.

1895
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1896
01:18:59,480 --> 01:18:59,820
Oh, never mind.

1897
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:00,540
Oh, never mind.

1898
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,540
Oh, I have no idea.

1899
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,100
Not a clue.

1900
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,240
Wait, is it kings?

1901
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,000
Oh, no.

1902
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:07,720
Oh, my God.

1903
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,780
Oh, good lord Bengals!

1904
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,040
Big love!

1905
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,840
Big love, it's just you, Liv!

1906
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,260
Oh my god!

1907
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,560
Oh, unless I know my fruits!

1908
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,060
Approximately how many different potatoes?

1909
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,960
Oh my god, why would you invite two of us?

1910
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,780
Guess hi, guess hi, 400...

1911
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,460
Oh, it's...

1912
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,940
No, John can't be that way!

1913
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,720
No, I gotta...

1914
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,040
I gotta run.

1915
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:30,520
Yes!

1916
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,320
Are you guys?

1917
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,920
20,000 fruits, but there's 4,000 potatoes?

1918
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,320
Oh...

1919
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,040
Yes.

1920
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:39,840
I'm in danger.

1921
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:40,640
Oh no.

1922
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,740
Oh no!

1923
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,020
What is a Padawan?

1924
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:44,400
Oh!

1925
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,560
It's the little creature guy, right?

1926
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,940
No, it's a big one!

1927
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:50,400
What?

1928
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,820
Just give me a...

1929
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,040
This is so close!

1930
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:56,240
Recovery!

1931
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,080
Recovery!

1932
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,140
Olympics!

1933
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,160
Oh this is so messed up.

1934
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:02,800
Oh god, oh god.

1935
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:05,620
Seven?

1936
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,080
Why?

1937
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,060
I don't know.

1938
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:08,460
I don't know.

1939
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:08,800
I don't know.

1940
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:09,160
I don't know.

1941
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:09,260
I don't know.

1942
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:09,500
I don't know.

1943
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,500
I think it's Melbourne.

1944
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,140
Damn it!

1945
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,040
Is it quite?

1946
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,360
I tried that word!

1947
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,560
No way Lord Finger fucking clutched this up.

1948
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,380
I'm fucking kicking Lord Finger out.

1949
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:20,980
Yes!

1950
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,680
Hey, I'm still here too!

1951
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,560
I would still be here!

1952
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,760
I would still be here!

1953
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,500
Zigg at the Sharko?

1954
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,300
Zigg?

1955
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,500
Probably Zigg, right?

1956
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,000
We're like completely ignoring- What is this?

1957
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:34,720
Stop!

1958
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,720
Okay, Lord Finger.

1959
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,380
How?

1960
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:38,800
Look at him!

1961
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:39,460
Oh!

1962
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:40,720
Look at him!

1963
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,760
Oh no!

1964
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,880
It's so over.

1965
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,220
It's so over.

1966
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,380
Buddy, enjoy your last dance.

1967
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,260
You are the winner.

1968
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,120
You are the final supper.

1969
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,720
This is your final dance, bud.

2018
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:02,880
No!

2019
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:03,840
No!

2020
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,360
I don't know anything about strategy.

2021
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,300
Let's start with the first of five rows.

2022
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,680
I'm not confident in this at all.

2023
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,420
Yo, I don't know anything.

2024
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:15,820
Demagorgon!

2025
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:16,640
Demagorgon!

2026
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:17,920
Demagorgon!

2027
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,300
That's the first answer.

2028
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,280
Stranger things?

2029
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:24,940
Let's go.

2030
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:25,840
Oh!

2031
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,900
Oh, I know this one.

2032
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:35,660
Yeah, this is a, this is like a really old game, so...

2033
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,700
It's gonna be like a review one.

2034
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,520
Oh, okay, okay.

2035
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:40,300
That's true.

2036
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,420
He's fine.

2037
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:43,980
Demogorgon.

2038
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:44,560
Demogon.

2039
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,840
How does Lucas protect his girlfriend, Max?

2040
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,300
Oh, this is not season one.

2041
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,040
Wait, what?

2042
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,620
Oh, season two.

2043
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,980
Um, oh, I don't know.

2044
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:52,520
Huh?

2045
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,380
I chose wrist rocket, but that doesn't really make much
sense.

2046
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,980
I chose thrush ice cream.

2047
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:57,660
Go-go gadget.

2048
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,380
Wrist rocket.

2049
01:23:59,140 --> 01:23:59,360
What?

2050
01:23:59,640 --> 01:23:59,960
That's it!

2051
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,140
What?

2052
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:01,820
What does that mean?

2053
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:03,300
What?

2054
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,320
What does that mean?

2055
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,040
They wrote that in?

2056
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,080
What is your nickname?

2057
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,500
He gets a new nickname?

2058
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,700
This is like Conan levels of...

2059
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,500
Wait, Debra!

2060
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,540
Debra!

2061
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:12,940
Debra!

2062
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:15,860
Debra!

2063
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,360
Hey guys, this is so messed up.

2064
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,860
I don't know anything about this.

2065
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,380
Debra would want an exchange for crawling through air ducts
that lead to a storage room.

2066
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:28,900
Who's Erica?

2067
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,560
Who's Erica?

2068
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,140
Uh...

2069
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,660
Oh, it probably is like Lucas's.

2070
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:36,320
Is that the sister?

2071
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,720
Oh, yeah, it's the sister.

2072
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,120
Lucas's sister.

2073
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,700
Damn, I want free ice cream for life.

2074
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,740
Yeah, me too.

2075
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,500
She'd want her brother's allowance.

2076
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Who created Stranger Things?

2077
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,780
Oh, I do know this.

2078
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,160
Yeah, I know this one too.

2079
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:50,500
No, wait.

2080
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,800
Everyone's mad at them right now.

2081
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,140
Oh, fuck.

2082
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,860
The Wachowski siblings?

2083
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:59,320
It's like the first thing that said siblings, because I know
they weren't.

2084
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,960
The sibling siblings.

2085
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,160
The siblings.

2086
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,300
Crazy Doc, you got the most fun.

2087
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:06,840
Yay!

2088
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,800
I don't know anything about Stranger Things.

2089
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,140

Sports equipment!

2096
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,280
It's got to be fair game for everyone.

2097
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,040
Yeah, we're technically all monsters.

2098
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,700
It's time for pictures.

2099
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,840

2100
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,480
Okay, here we go.

2101
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,620
Press a button when you know what the picture is.

2102
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:02,220
Okay, okay.

2103
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,940
Yeah, this is literally beasts.

2104
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,040
Oh, God.

2105
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:07,460
Crap.

2106
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:07,920
Pressure.

2107
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,760
I'm not even gonna make a joke, man.

2108
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,040
I'm gonna be dead silent

2109
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,340
Huh a finger huh?

2110
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,800

2111
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,840
What is it?

2112
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,020
What the hell is that?

2113
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,120
What is that?

2114
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,180
What is that?

2115
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,040
Lord finger reveal?

2116
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,160
I think it's Jack the Giant Killer.

2117
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:34,980
Oh, okay.

2118
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:36,200
What?

2119
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:41,040
Oh, okay That's not a mythical dream.

2120
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah.

2121
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,800
On this vase.

2122
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,180
On this vase.

2123
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,940
Someone already guessed.

2124
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,380
Yeah, I'm just guessing.

2125
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,220
I'm just guessing.

2126
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:51,580
Yeah.

2127
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:52,180
I'm just guessing.

2128
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,080
Oh, no, I shouldn't have guessed.

2129
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,080
I shouldn't have guessed.

2130
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,140
We can't.

2131
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:57,980
We can't just go...

2132
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:02,840
I'm...

2133
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,260
I'm growing.

2134
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,380
Are we gonna do a baby?

2135
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,340
Chin Chin is out.

2136
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,000
Defeated?

2137
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,580
Defeated.

2138
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,680
I'm gonna...

2139
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,160
Dude, I don't know the statue.

2140
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,100
Oh, I think I know it actually.

2141
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:20,940
Maybe.

2142
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:21,640
I'm guessing.

2143
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,820
I just guessed.

2144
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,600
Oh my fucking god!

2145
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:25,660
Stop!

2146
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,940
It's the milking farm.

2147
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,040
It's the milking farm.

2148
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,400
I don't know.

2149
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:32,440
It's the milking farm.

2150
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,140
I don't want to see this.

2151
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:38,320
There's a lot of sausages out, aren't there?

2152
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:39,740
There's so many...

2153
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,300
This is a sausage party.

2154
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,220
There's so many paintings in the mythical...

2155
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,920
It's a beef sausage, man.

2156
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,600
Name it is dog.

2157
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,020
I'm just guessing.

2158
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:48,980
Yeah, just guessing.

2159
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,320
I guess the only dog I knew.

2160
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,360
Yeah, I got it right.

2161
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,260
Thank you, Hades.

2162
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,420
I am in my element!

2163
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:57,240
Woo!

2164
01:27:58,180 --> 01:27:59,020
Oh, yeah.

2165
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,300
I'm not knowing any stranger things, trivia.

2166
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,560
Which monster is this?

2167
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2168
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,400
Yes?

2169
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:16,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2170
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,040
That was my bad.

2171
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:18,700
Oops.

2172
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,640
I bad fingered it.

2173
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:21,660
Oops.

2174
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,000
Oh, yeah.

2175
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:23,540
Nice.

2176
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,480
Oh, yeah.

2177
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,480
All right.

2178
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,220
Oh, yeah.

2179
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:33,140
Yeah, that stranger thinks category was rough for me.

2180
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,620
Mr. B.

2181
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:34,920
S.

2182
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,580
He's gombed for us.

2183
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,200
What does that mean?

2184
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,880
Cowling show.

2185
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,140
Mr. Beer, can you do this?

2186
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,500
Cowling showdown.

2187
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:45,700
Of course.

2188
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,600
Oh my god.

2189
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,100
Mr. Beer.

2190
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:55,980
Mr. Beer, this is appropriation.

2191
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,820
Mr. Beer to just make it up and go inside me out.

2192
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,560
I know karate.

2193
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,680
I'll show you.

2194
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,740
Watch this.

2195
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,760
It was like watching a nine-year-old do it.

2196
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:07,380
It was like snowing into it with like a broomstick.

2197
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,620
My friend and I made this dance.

2198
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,080
Roblox!

2199
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,300
Roblox!

2200
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,480
Roblox!

2201
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:17,560
Roblox!

2202
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,140
No!

2203
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,920
Not literature!

2204
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,900
I hate books!

2205
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,960
Okay, 90s music then.

2206
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:31,060
Now, you don't make it to me.

2207
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,820
Finally, we get to steal points again.

2208
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,580
That was the biggest fight yet, I think.

2209
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,380
Don't let Barry win.

2210
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,800
Don't let her have the satisfaction.

2211
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:39,660
Please!

2212
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,940
Steal points from the player with the most points.

2213
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:45,620
All right, whatever.

2214
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,100
Just lock in, I guess.

2215
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:47,940
Nineteenth music.

2216
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:48,500
I guess.

2217
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:52,720
Which country music star sings about friends in low places?

2218
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,560
Oh, my God, friends in low places.

2219
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,360
Who are these people?

2220
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,720
I don't know what it is, though.

2221
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,540
I know the song.

2222
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:00,960
Tale McGraw.

2223
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,020
Oh, shit.

2224
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:02,160
Oh, shit.

2225
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,280
Oh, dang, I thought it was.

2226
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:03,760
I didn't know.

2227
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,520
Nobody knew that.

2228
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,120
It didn't even sound like a country name.

2229
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,240
I don't know what that is.

2230
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,720
I'm sorry for you.

2231
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,760
How did we choose this again?

2232
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:16,920
Oh, I have no idea.

2233
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,580
I don't know.

2234
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:18,640
I don't know.

2235
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,380
I'm gonna guess.

2236
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:29,140
Mr. Beard, who would you like to steal voice from?

2237
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,720
Mr. Beard.

2238
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,820
Flashy, Flashy.

2239
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,900
Crazy, crazy.

2240
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,720
Oh no, I can't read when everyone's talking.

2241
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:40,940
No!

2242
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,380
Okay, fair enough.

2243
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,680
That works, that works, that works, that works.

2244
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,540
Which song by Madonna encouraged listeners to strike a pose?

2245
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,940
Strike a pose.

2246
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:53,080
Oh.

2247
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,240
This is- I'm feeling everyone knew that.

2248
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,060
Oh, wait, I should have read.

2249
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,720
I did not know with my bad.

2250
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,220
Of course it's- I did not.

2251
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,180
Whoa.

2252
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,200
Yeah, it's me!

2253
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,240
Okay, uh...

2254
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,000
Don't do it.

2255
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,460
Don't do it.

2256
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,820
Go ahead.

2257
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:10,960
Okay.

2258
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:11,800
Crazy dork.

2259
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:12,380
Crazy dork.

2260
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,260
Crazy dork.

2261
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:13,900
Crazy dork.

2262
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,320
Crazy dork.

2263
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:14,760
Crazy dork.

2264
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:15,220
Crazy dork.

2265
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:18,720
Wow.

2266
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,200
Woohoo.

2267
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,080
Lady Nut.

2268
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:24,440
Evil.

2269
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,240
How could you get so few points?

2270
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:26,620
Ouch.

2271
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,400
What the hell?

2272
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,700
What happened to you twice?

2273
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,580
Why did he call you out like that?

2274
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:32,700
You know what?

2275
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,360
I'm gonna skip the dance because you heard my feelings,
dude.

2276
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:36,560
Lady Nut.

2277
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,020
Oh, no.

2278
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:39,060
Wow.

2279
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,060
She's pissed.

2280
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,240
Vibe killer.

2281
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,640
Don't be a sore loser.

2282
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:46,760
Don't be a sore loser.

2283
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,700
They know tap, tap, tap.

2284
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,760
All right, what we got here.

2285
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,340
Absolutely not US President.

2286
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,180
Absolutely not US President.

2287
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,340
Food around the world.

2288
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,060
Food around the world.

2289
01:31:59,520 --> 01:31:59,700
Oh yeah.

2290
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,900
I don't think the Americans.

2291
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:05,300
What are you going to think I would not know?

2292
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:09,660
I see how many they asked us how many of them were only
children.

2293
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,820
How would I know...

2294
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,820
Yeah, what the heck?

2295
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:12,980
What the heck?

2296
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,740
I think that's a common trivia question, though.

2297
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:18,620
The food pictures are making me hungry, though.

2298
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,380
Yeah, I know.

2299
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:19,820
Me too.

2300
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,680
Went back at it.

2301
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,980
Which sandwich are you likely to find in Greece?

2302
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:24,520
Oh, yeah.

2303
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:25,580
Oh.

2304
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:27,960
Yeah?

2305
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,360
I only knew from the gas.

2306
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,000
You need to mute my mic.

2307
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,180
I get excited about the right answer.

2308
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,720
Just the popping sound was crazy.

2309
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,680
This photo shows a popular way to eat fish in Portugal.

2310
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,080
To eat fish.

2311
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:49,020
Uh.

2312
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:54,640
Oh.

2313
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:55,720
Okay.

2314
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,920
Oh, yeah.

2315
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,060
Flashy flash.

2316
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,180
We are the same.

2317
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,120
Nice, nice.

2318
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:05,860
Oh.

2319
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,420
Pia, you gotta lock in.

2320
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,340
I'm so serious.

2321
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,440
Please be us.

2322
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,760
She's gonna leave us.

2323
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,040
Oh, I'm...

2324
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,360
Oh, I don't know, man.

2325
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,000
I don't know.

2326
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,460
Mmm, I love a good girl.

2327
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:19,700
Oh, wait, no.

2328
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,920
I miss red.

2329
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,620
Oh, I thought it was a different thing than this.

2330
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,160
I thought those were...

2331
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,180
Are those not lentils?

2332
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,660
I thought it was spinach.

2333
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,240
No.

2334
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,280
Someone's got to pick.

2335
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,360
It's Lady Nut.

2336
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:32,740
Lady Nut.

2337
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:33,400
Lady Nut.

2338
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,740
Oh, I was right!

2339
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,800
They never showed it, like, two times.

2340
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:38,700
Delicious.

2341
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,320
They showed coffee four times.

2342
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:41,560
Mmm.

2343
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,520
Lentil.

2344
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,280
Lentil.

2345
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:44,780
Delicious.

2346
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,860
Like our delicious victory.

2347
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:48,460
Oh.

2348
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,400
Wait, was that it?

2349
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,700
Everyone picked it.

2350
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:53,740
Wait, wait.

2351
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,120
It was to, and that was to Jean, I think.

2352
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:57,660
Yeah.

2353
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:58,420
Oh, wait.

2354
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,500
We had to wait for the cycle back.

2355
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,340
We had no shame, Vicky.

2356
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,560
It's such a shame.

2357
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,200
It's such a shame.

2358
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,960
I do realize we are not finished sauce.

2359
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,620
Mmm, I want to eat all of these.

2360
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,500
Which meat is famously produced in Spain and Portugal.

2361
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,620
You guys make me freak out.

2362
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:25,940
Everybody starts cooking.

2363
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,820
I think I'm showing you the first one.

2364
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,600
I guess they didn't say which meat and then they showed
meat.

2365
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:36,240
Yeah, you bericho ham.

2366
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,200
The bericho ham is really popular in Japan, but I don't
think that they...

2367
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:39,580
Oh, really?

2368
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,400
I think it's actually just like lunch meat.

2369
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,320
They give out and say it's a miracle ham.

2370
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:43,920
Oh, yeah.

2371
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,080
Why would they do that?

2372
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,220
I finally get a dog.

2373
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,620
Let's go.

2374
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,120
What dance will you do?

2375
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,060
Which one?

2376
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,680
I don't think we've had the zombie zone halfway.

2377
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,520
She's forking dancing.

2378
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:57,160
Oh,

2379
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,940
this is a Michael Jackson, right?

2380
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,820
Yeah, this is just Michael Jackson.

2381
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:05,760
Oh, my God.

2382
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,320
Because this is thriller.

2383
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,280
What a dance.

2384
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,400
It's time for the last.

2385

01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,340
Oh, wait.

2425
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,440

2426
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,020
No, I bet the other neighbor.

2427
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:48,520
I bet the other neighbor.

2428
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,420
I don't know.

2429
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,040
I leave those.

2430
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,660
I've been getting all of the wrong.

2431
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,820
The fall of Mr. Beard.

2432
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,420
Of the following, which is considered a normal blood
pressure.

2433
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,400
What the fuck?

2434

01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Guys, I'm sorry.

2439
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,480
I'm flopping here.

2440
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,180
No, no, we can do it.

2441
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:16,520
We can do it.

2442
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,420

Oh, God.

01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,480
On the street, do the neighbors characters live.

2447
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,500
Oh, oh, oh.

2448
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:25,000

2454
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,560
Mr. Beard is out.

2455
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,400
Mr. Beard lives.

2456
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,140
No, he doesn't.

2457
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,080
I'm glad Mr. Beard got shaved.

2458
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:43,700
Who will do viral for lab now?

2459
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,140

Who knows?

2461
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,660
That has a fancy name.

2462
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,460
Mezzler?

2463
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:54,100
No.

2464
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,260
Okay.

2465
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,180
Stop that emotion.

2466
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,120
Dude, I'm him.

2467
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:58,960

2468
01:37:59,300 --> 01:37:59,560
Flashy Flash.

2469
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,400
Flashy Flash goes to the top restaurant.

2470
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,900
Flashy Flash goes to this flashy restaurant.

2471
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,060
What can I say?

2472
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,080
I can't get to all the flashing flashy flesh does.

2473
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:08,640
What?

2474
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:09,820
You get paid.

2475
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,340

There's shambles.

2478
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,480
I know this because of the meme.

2479
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,460
I only know it because of the meme with the map.

2480
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,320
I don't know.

2481
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,080

2483
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:27,900

01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,840
Oh, um, fuck.

2488
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,360

2570
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,340
Shout out to my groupies.

2571
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,240
I think we're all team smarts and just Barry can be team
smart.

2572
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,720
I think so too.

2573
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:12,060
Yeah.

2574
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,140
We're all winners.

2575
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:15,660
No.

2576
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:16,940
We're all winners.

2577
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,820
I think there do have.

2578
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,960
There has to be a loser.

2579
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:21,920
There has to be a loser for there to be winners.

2580
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:22,520
You know what I mean?

2581
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:23,440
Bear, yeah.

2582
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,040
It's a metaphor for life.

2583
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,620
I won the game.

2584
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:33,400
May I just comment on the percentage of American questions
in that final round.

2585
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:40,880
It started so British that I thought this game was British
because it was like, you know, like the Ireland and

2586
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,140
whatever.

2587
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:43,420
Then they slowly phased those out.

2588
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:44,960
Absolutely ridiculous.

2589
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,500
It was karma for the Stranger Things category.

2590
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:50,300
Yeah, probably.

2591
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,340
Fair enough.

2592
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:55,540
So...

2593
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,420
Does this mean...

2594
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,600
Does this mean that these things are winnings?

2595
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,920
Team Chair?

2596
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,660
Who is the winner?

2597
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:08,000
I mean, I guess you guys shouldn't have disavowed me so
early in the stream.

2598
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:08,580
I don't know.

2599
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:09,280
Maybe...

2600
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,320
Maybe if you guys didn't like...

2601
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:16,780
We told you you could be back on the team if you brought on
home.

2602
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:17,960
We love bugs.

2603
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,080
We love bugs.

2604
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,480
Oh, yeah.

2605
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,080
Oh, yeah.

2606
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,100
Oh, it's so hard.

2607
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,180
I'm calling couples counseling again.

2608
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,520
I can't believe this is the third time this tweet.

2609
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:34,100
She's gonna get, she's gonna hate us.

2610
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,660
Every pink and green and blue and red.

2611
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,380
Oh, my God.

2612
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,540
Oh, my God.

2613
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:40,860
Oh, my God.

2614
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:41,060
Oh, my God.

2615
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,160
Who the hell was that?

2616
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,300
What would it be like flesh here?

2617
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,000
Oh no.

2618
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:47,900
Densetsu.

2619
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,000
Densetsu.

2620
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:51,700
Densetsu.

2621
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:51,700
Densu.

2622
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:52,220
Densu.

2623
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:52,420
Densu.

2624
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,180
Densu.

2625
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:03,900
They're running off and making a gen together in a whole...

2626
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,120
It's not even Densetsu or Beasties.

2627
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,680
It's just a whole new unit.

2628
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,200
It's just Barry and Lord Fingers.

2629
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:12,200
Yeah.

2630
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,240
Getting contact with that guy afterwards.

2631
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,060
Alright, anyways, in all serious news, congrats to both of
us for winning.

2632
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,240
We all won today.

2633
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:23,980
Yeah!

2634
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:25,260
Yeah!

2635
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,240
Yeah!

2636
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,460
Very lost.

2637
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,560
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2638
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,860
That's actually factually untrue.

2639
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,680
Statistically correct.

2640
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:39,900
Someone in the chat, someone in the chat got really
mathematical about it and said, team chair has 1.33.

2641
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:47,180
Team Densets AXE has 1.33, and BC's have 1.33, which means a
chair loses.

2642
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,780
So, um...

2643
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,060
Yay, Team Densets have BC!

2644
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,860
I guess it isn't funny anymore.

2645
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,300
We don't want to be a loser.

2646
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:01,260
They pulled out the calculators to see what happens.

2647
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,560
According to my calculation.

2648
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,680
I'm tricky.

2649
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,540
But yeah, thanks guys for coming to the collab.

2650
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,520
It was really fun.

2651
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,020
It was so fun.

2652
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:15,880
It was a lot of fun.

2653
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,480
I love Beasties and Densetsu.

2654
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:18,980
Aww.

2655
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,580
I love Beasties and Densetsu too.

2656
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,340
And also, in seriousness, I am a member of Beasties.

2657
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:25,740
For anyone who is uninitiated, I am a member of Beasties.

2658
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:26,780
For now.

2659
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,640
For now.

2660
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:30,700
Team meeting after this.

2661
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,480
Wait, she doesn't mean that she's leaving.

2662
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:33,840
It means that she's getting kicked out.

2663
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,440
She just doesn't want to be on team five.

2664
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,500
We know the truth.

2665
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:40,960
I just want to be a winner.

2666
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,380
I just want to be a winner, guys.

2667
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:43,020
Come on.

2668
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:45,440
Yeah.

2669
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,460
It was really fun.

2670
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,640
We should play again.

2671
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,920
Yeah, that was actually a lot more fun than I thought.

2672
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,020
Yeah.

2673
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:51,640
Yeah.

2674
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:52,520
Yeah.

2675
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,920
Pickle Quiz is coming out this year.

2676
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,600
Pickle Quiz.

2677
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:56,340
Pickle Quiz.

2678
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:57,720
Is that real?

2679
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,760
Yeah, that sounds like something Pia Mega.

2680
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:01,820
I know, right?

2681
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:02,440
Is that real?

2682
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,140
My psychosis?

2683
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:04,940
No, it's real.

2684
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:05,480
It's real.

2685
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:06,600
Yeah.

2686
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:07,500
You should try it.

That they want to plug, give an outro or anything.

We start with Den Satsu.

2696

My thing.

I'm doing a 3D jazz live show.

2702
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,600
February 13th.

2703
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,820
Tickets are sold out for the venue, but there will be
streaming tickets.

2704
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:10,540
Woo!

2705

Yay!

2707
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,760
So definitely keep an eye out for that.

2708
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:25,280
Also, uh, Densetsu.exe's fan club is opening up very, very,
very, very, very, very soon!

2709
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:25,980

It's gonna be super exciting, so keep an eye out for that.

2711
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:30,840
Is that like the...

2712
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,300
What can we expect from the fan club?

2713
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,240
Yeah, it's gonna be our monthly Patreon.

2714
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:39,660
It's gonna be like, uh, stuff that's exclusive to each
month.

2715
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,640
It's the best way to directly support the group.

2716
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,780
So, hope to see people there.

2717
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:46,500
Fun time.

2718
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:50,780
Yeah, you will see Vicky's 500-word paragraph on why she
likes Stranger Things.

2719
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:56,100
And she's already been written 6,000 times.

2720
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:58,940
You know what else?

2721
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,520
You know what else we've got coming.

2722
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,820
Lord Fingers, Deb, you straight now.

2723
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,720
Lord Fingers!

2724
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,960
Lord Fingers.

2725
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,920
Sorry I didn't work out for you very well.

2726
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,220
We can take you back.

2727
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:15,300
He's the one.

2728
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,520
I guess.

2729
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,040
I guess.

2730
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,280
It's over, man.

2731
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:19,780
But you do have to clean.

2732
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,820
You do have to clean the Beasties Hall for like the next
month.

2733
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,680
Do I have to be in like the basement too?

2734
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:28,100
Can I be, can I have an actual room or am I, am I kicked
out?

2735
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,380
We'll, we'll discuss it.

2736
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,600
You gotta stay in the basement but we'll feed you sometimes
at least.

2737
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,180
Oh man.

2738
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,060
You can keep your chair.

2739
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,480
How much room do you need?

2740
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:37,120
You can keep the chair.

2741
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:37,940
Oh my god.

2742
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,100
Am I wrong?

2743
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,180
That's rude to say.

2744
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:45,520
But also, she's right.

2745
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,480
Can't I stay on, like, one of your shoulders?

2746
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:55,260
