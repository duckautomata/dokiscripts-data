1
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,210
I didn't expect it to be that loud.

2
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,170
I couldn't hear it.

3
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,450
What's going on?

4
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,190
It's a road sound!

5
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,770
It's a road sound!

6
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,870
Making pasta.

7
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,390
I always want pasta.

8
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,310
Also...

9
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,190
Tiz himself.

10
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,130
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

11
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,010
Welcome back, Master Tamagotchi!

12
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,930
I was surprised.

13
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
I was really surprised.

14
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,290
I don't think we watched this before, did we?

15
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,260
Witchcraft.

16
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh, headless man!

17
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,680
Oh, just kidding.

18
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,980
Is that a boob?

19
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,700
Oh, pun.

20
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,620
Oh my god, space!

21
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,900
What is going on?

22
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,640
This is making me even more confused.

23
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh, nasty!

24
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,910
Torture!

25
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,590
Math!

26
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,230
Oh!

27
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,830
Outer Wilds!

28
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,330
That's on the cover.

29
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,770
Came back from my vacay at Niagara Falls.

30
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,430
Back to Minto.

31
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,790
Yay!

32
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,490
Welcome back!

33
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,730
Eternal...

34
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,050
Oh.

35
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,150
Oh, never mind.

36
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,870
It's not eternal.

37
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,410
That's just for the second.

38
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,510
Huh?

39
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,510
That

40
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,200
confused me...

41
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,380
more than everything.

42
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,260
What?

43
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,640
I still don't know what this game is about.

44
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,020
Welcome back, everybody, to Eternal Darkness.

45
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,440
Sanity's Requiem.

46
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,780
My sanity has been...

47
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,700
revoked.

48
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,860
Math is the scariest part of the game.

49
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,640
That's what I'm saying!

50
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,440
It's loud, is it?

51
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,400
I can't tell...

52
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,160
which one you're hearing.

53
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Sorry.

54
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:12,820
Sorry.

55
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,580
Is it okay now?

56
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,840
Wait, can you hear that?

57
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,820
Can you still hear the game?

58
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,600
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

59
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,040
You can?

60
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,360
You can still hear the game?

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,380
Oh my gosh.

62
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,920
No wonder it's so loud for you guys.

63
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,820
I'm so sorry.

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,820
I thought you were hearing it...

65
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,820
through...

66
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,440
well, then maybe...

67
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,420
if I do this, can you still hear it?

68
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,200
Thanks for the five gifts.

69
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,480
Sorry.

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,860
We're doing a soundcheck now.

71
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,660
You can still hear it?

72
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,280
Oh, perfect!

73
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,900
Interesting...

74
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,500
Interesting...

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm learning things.

76
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,800
The adventures of Pius Augustus, our favorite lich.

77
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,780
Pius Augustus!

78
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
Okay, cool.

79
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,160
I learned actually...

80
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,480
So much from that, actually.

81
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
Have a good stream.

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
I thought it said good morning.

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,580
May I have a happy birthday?

84
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:38,960
Of course!

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
Happy birthday to you.

86
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,080
Happy birthday to you.

87
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,020
Happy birthday, Zennara.

88
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,120
Happy birthday to you.

89
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,640
The game is heavily inspired by H.P.

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Lovecraft.

91
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,020
Not just his monsters, but the style of his writing.

92
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,260
I see.

93
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm gonna be honest, you guys.

94
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,800
I am so...

95
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,820
Tired today.

96
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't know.

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,860
Maybe because I...

98
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,360
I didn't sleep very well last night.

99
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,020
And yesterday I...

100
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
Streamed for like, what, five hours?

101
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,580
And then I recorded that day too.

102
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,080
And then I also recorded today.

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
So I'm...

104
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,840
So E.P.

105
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm so E.P.

106
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,460
So I'm not sure how long I'll go.

107
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
We'll see once I start getting into it.

108
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,180
Maybe I'll start...

109
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,840
I'll...

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
I can't even speak.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,280
Paragon.

112
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,240
Why is it...

113
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,980
What is the paragon?

114
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,780
Everybody keeps mentioning the paragon.

115
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,580
I wanna be in on the joke too.

116
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,920
I wanna be in on the joke too.

117
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,360
Again, I'm really sorry about the sound.

118
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,820
I didn't realize where you guys were hearing it from.

119
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,020
So...

120
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,400
It's just some...

121
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,360
It's some...

122
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,320
Tech stuff on my end.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,800
I thought...

124
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,920
But now I've learned.

125
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,620
So you guys actually helped me out a whole bunch.

126
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,660
You don't even...

127
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:09,780
You don't even...

128
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,600
You don't even realize it.

129
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,600
Paragon.

130
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,060
Paragon.

131
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,220
What's the paragon?

132
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,300
It will become very apparent what the paragon is.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,520
Paragon.

134
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,060
Paragon.

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,680
Paragon.

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Paragon.

137
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,760
Paragon.

138
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,260
Paragon.

139
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,420
Paragon.

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:23,960
Paragon.

141
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,160
Paragon.

142
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,680
RONAN, welcome to the membership.

143
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,100
Thank you.

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,520
Yeah.

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,100
So...

146
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's not waste too much time talking because...

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh god.

148
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,400
I've already ordered...

149
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,340
I have a coffee.

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,800
I have coffee.

151
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,200
I have coffee.

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,220
I have coffee.

153
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,760
I have coffee.

154
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,820
We'll see how far I can get.

155
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,100
Look, we're Anthony in 814 A.D.

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,480
The darkness columns.

157
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh, it's right where we left off!

158
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,720
This is actually perfect because I can...

159
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,980
Whoa, cinema.

160
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
The darkness comes.

161
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,080
Anthony!

162
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm gonna turn it up just a bit.

163
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,220
How do I run?

164
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,960
Nope, this is a stand.

165
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Okay, this is how I select which arm and stuff, I believe.

166
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,200
I have to be like, head!

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,120
Right arm!

168
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,520
Left arm!

169
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,660
Get him in the nuts!

170
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,860
And then I run.

171
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,880
This is how I run.

172
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay, nice.

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,100
Left trigger to run, yeah.

174
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,960
And so we're here in good old ye olde 1814.

175
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,140
We're trying to talk to this guy here.

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,960
We need to talk to Charlemagne because I think he's gonna get...

177
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,060
I think he's gonna get...

178
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,580
killeded.

179
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,500
This is one of my favorite games of all time.

180
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,780
You're one of my favorite Toofas of all time.

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm so happy you're playing this game.

182
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:21,980
Ah!

183
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,560
Thank you, Rhoda!

184
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,260
Thank you!

185
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,400
Yeah, there was this dead guy over here.

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
What happened to him?

187
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,740
Anthony sees the body of a monk.

188
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,500
His raiment...

189
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,820
Raiment.

190
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
Turn off the game console.

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,480
Is that of his order.

192
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,120
Stained with blood that has seeped from many grievous wounds.

193
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,920
It's truly a disturbing sight.

194
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
Vivicore, thanks for the gift!

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,060
We just can't stop staring though.

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,500
We have like this gruesome...

197
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,100
morbid curiosity, right?

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm a... I'm a good...

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,940
I'm a good...

200
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,200
I go to church, look.

201
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm a good guy.

202
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,540
Haha!

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,700
Oh!

204
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Oh my gosh.

205
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,370
But I can't leave either.

206
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,610
This game...

207
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,190
We have to go upstairs...

208
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,190
So basically last time we...

209
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,990
Open...

210
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,610
The way he runs is so funny.

211
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,650
The way he runs is so funny.

212
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,750
But we opened up this...

213
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,010
Whoa!

214
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,650
Secret passageway.

215
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,450
And I have to climb down and probably be bombarded by bozos.

216
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,630
That was a good alliteration.

217
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,770
Bombarded by bozos.

218
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,950
You got that scroll.

219
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,630
Oh yes!

220
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,690
How do I do this magic?

221
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,910
Oh yes!

222
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,890
We also got the Tome of Eternal Darkness!

223
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,470
We got that!

224
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,590
Very nice.

225
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,530
I'm gonna make myself a weeb...

226
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,590
A weeb Ted smaller.

227
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,150
There we go.

228
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,550
Hey Min, thanks for the stream.

229
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,130
Really needed it.

230
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:02,290
Aww!

231
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,010
Thank you!

232
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,710
Last minute work has now destroyed my sleep cycle.

233
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,870
I have a three mile run in three or four hours.

234
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,130
Do you have to do the run?

235
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,380
We got this urn.

236
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,580
Not quite sure.

237
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,280
And then our...

238
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,780
Wait, no.

239
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,580
This is the scroll that we're trying to give to...

240
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,160
Charlemagne.

241
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
For some reason, we just can't knock.

242
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,220
We don't know how to do that.

243
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh shoot.

244
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,600
Wait.

245
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,420
Is it under...

246
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,640
Spell list.

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
We know nothing.

248
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,980
We're kind of dumb.

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,120
Yeah.

250
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,440
Anthony does not have enough components to attempt to research spell...

251
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,520
He does not have enough...

252
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
That sounds like such an insult.

253
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,420
I want to start using that.

254
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Oh, you just don't have enough components to attempt to do this at the moment.

255
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,340
Cat peeing on the rug in the early hours of the morning.

256
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,580
It's my fault.

257
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,980
I messed up my...

258
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,020
Oh, no.

259
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,140
Not the cat pee.

260
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
I'm so sorry.

261
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,600
Not that you have eternal darkness save on your memory card, you should probably go back to the Psycho Mantis boss and twin snakes.

262
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh my gosh.

263
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,520
You're right.

264
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,400
We got some runes, though.

265
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,620
We got this one rune.

266
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
It says...

267
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,040
It's called the Circle of Power, but clearly not powerful enough.

268
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,020
We can't even do a quick spell.

269
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:23,660
Oh.

270
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,640
Okay.

271
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,220
That's...

272
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,680
Okay.

273
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,980
So, it'll be on the D-pad.

274
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,520
Okay.

275
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
And then...

276
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,560
Oh, gosh.

277
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm so not used to...

278
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,820
I never had a GameCube growing up.

279
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,760
So, I love how you said Tome of Eternal Darkness.

280
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,060
Oh.

281
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,360
Oh.

282
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,460
I love how happy you said Tome of Eternal Darkness.

283
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,700
So, why...

284
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:49,860
Okay.

285
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,320
That's why.

286
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,380
Oh.

287
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,080
All right.

288
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,720
Now that I have saved, I have no fear of death.

289
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Maybe.

290
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Already?

291
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,260
Oh, my God.

292
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,860
No.

293
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,320
Sorry.

294
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,660
Let's get his arm.

295
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,180
Get his arm.

296
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,680
Get his arm.

297
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,880
They get this other arm.

298
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,020
Take out his arm.

299
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,900
Finish him.

300
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,420
I

301
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,830
found a magical rune.

302
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,030
Rune!

303
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,270
Good job, Anthony.

304
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,570
How's the sound, by the way?

305
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:35,950
Oh!

306
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,150
Runes are the key element in creating spells.

307
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,450
By collecting and combining runes in different ways, different spells can be created.

308
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,790
Okay.

309
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,350
I'm gonna make a new spell.

310
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:45,850
Dang it.

311
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,550
I have a rune.

312
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,930
Question mark, question mark.

313
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,050
Sounds good?

314
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,570
Okay, cool.

315
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,590
Oh!

316
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,090
Anthony!

317
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,450
Anthony!

318
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,610
Anthony!

319
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,030
Anthony!

320
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,670
Oh my god.

321
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,930
I forgot the music is so freaky in this.

322
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,370
Oh!

323
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:08,810
Okay.

324
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,410
Try it.

325
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,650
Do you have a rune for me?

326
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,270
Ouch!

327
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,530
It's okay.

328
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,290
Wait, I don't have a way to heal.

329
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,830
Not like the last person.

330
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,950
Are you gonna come up too?

331
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,150
Okay, good, good, good.

332
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,010
Come here.

333
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,530
Come here!

334
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,310
Ha!

335
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:31,990
Ha!

336
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:32,970
Ha!

337
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,550
I'm getting pretty good at this fighting thing.

338
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,050
Good news, I got an interview tomorrow.

339
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,130
Oh my gosh!

340
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,290
So disgust...

341
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,320
Good luck, good luck.

342
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,100
Oh.

343
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,440
Oh my god, Anthony does not look well.

344
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,440
Oh my god!

345
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,730
Oh, it revealed a door.

346
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,590
Oh, I got you, I got you, I got you!

347
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,730
I got you, don't worry!

348
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,390
Hey!

349
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,790
Don't get him!

350
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,830
Oh my god, no, no, no!

351
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:15,980
Hey!

352
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

353
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,080
Go after this guy, here.

354
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,460
Go after his other arm.

355
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,800
There.

356
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,200
Go after his arm.

357
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,360
There we go.

358
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,820
No, no, finish him!

359
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,120
Did I save him?

360
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,100
Or...

361
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,320
Oh!

362
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,560
I got a torch!

363
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,480
Uh...

364
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,240
Can I only have one of these equipped?

365
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,780
Or...

366
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,630
Oh my gosh.

367
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,550
It's one or the other.

368
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,870
Wait, but they died by this.

369
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,090
What's that?

370
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,170
Broken green urn.

371
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,450
Oh, there's urns here too.

372
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,390
This function allows the player to combine two or more items from the inventory into one.

373
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,330
Mix.

374
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,210
Two thirds!

375
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,850
Two thirds!

376
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,670
There's more of you.

377
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,450
There's more of you.

378
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,550
I never cared for idle things, but recently I watched a 10 minute video on how the mix came to be.

379
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,810
I never cared for idle things, but recently I watched a 10 minute video on how the mix came to be.

380
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,710
Didn't get me with MGS yet, though.

381
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,830
I'll get you, I swear!

382
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,130
I'll get you, I'll get you, my pretty!

383
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,430
I don't know if that's...

384
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,310
Okay, assembled is like...

385
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,030
Assembled, I think, is a bit of a stretch.

386
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,930
You know?

387
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,110
It's okay, Anthony, don't worry about it.

388
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,210
Can I place it here?

389
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,850
Oh wait, maybe here?

390
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,390
Oh, I can just check it.

391
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,490
Fragments of a broken urn pieced together to form a crude hole.

392
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,590
Deep cracks mar its structure and while it is almost complete, it is far from watertight.

393
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,170
At least it can be repaired somehow.

394
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,870
Do you think the monk was supposed to do that?

395
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,110
That didn't mean...

396
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,050
I didn't kill him, though!

397
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,690
He fell!

398
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,490
He took one hit and fell!

399
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,990
I tried to save him, he should've...

400
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,630
Oh my god.

401
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I wish I could...

402
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,420
Look at Anthony, he's staring at it.

403
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,320
Oh, is it coming this way?

404
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,160
I hear you.

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,440
Oh no!

406
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,040
I pushed him down the stairs!

407
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,540
Finish him?

408
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,620
Finish him?

409
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,240
Finish him?

410
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,460
Finish him?

411
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,260
There's no way to finish him.

412
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,260
Okay.

413
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,140
Magormor!

414
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,900
He was going to give you a long sword.

415
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh shoot.

416
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh well.

417
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,300
A carved stone tablet lies on the stone floor.

418
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,640
Maybe the guy should've just left.

419
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh, let's pick it up.

420
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,680
Magical...

421
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,160
The codex.

422
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,860
Runes cannot be understood without a codex.

423
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,660
Without a codex, runes in your possession will remain a mystery.

424
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,700
Without a codex, runes in your possession will remain a mystery.

425
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
What runes do I got now?

426
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm smarter.

427
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,240
I have the codex!

428
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
Oh, Magormor!

429
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,400
I understand now.

430
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,160
I'm so confused.

431
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,060
I'm so confused.

432
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,980
That guy came all the way up the stairs just to see me.

433
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,600
Oh no!

434
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,440
What's wrong, Anthony?

435
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
Oh, he will look really bad.

436
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,020
Oh my god!

437
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,600
Look at these sassy guys.

438
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,040
They're fighting.

439
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
The girls are fighting.

440
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
The girls are fighting.

441
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm gonna sneak up on this guy.

442
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,520
Oh!

443
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,360
Can I finish him?

444
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,160
If I... hold on.

445
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,580
Because I'm gonna need more... what's it called, right?

446
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,120
I'm gonna need more sanity at some point.

447
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
So if I... finish him!

448
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,640
Switch it out, right?

449
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
Finish him!

450
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,480
Easy!

451
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,600
Yeah, so I just switch it with the... equip the torch and then we...

452
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,660
Nice!

453
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll take that.

454
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh, just kidding.

455
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,140
A red urn sits beside the fountain.

456
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,320
Lucky!

457
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,180
A filled red urn.

458
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,880
And we can fill up...

459
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Oh, there's another...

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,020
What are you looking at, Anthony?

461
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,720
You're scaring me.

462
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,860
You're making me nervous.

463
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,760
A slab of etched stone sits on the pedestal.

464
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,280
Sanity is overrated.

465
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,900
Hahaha!

466
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,360
Drink the water.

467
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,080
Drink the water.

468
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,120
A disturbing rendition of a monstrous devil!

469
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,040
Okay, buddy, calm down.

470
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,860
It's a statue.

471
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,800
It is contorted into what appears to be a fountain.

472
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,440
Or it was built that way.

473
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
It was carved that way.

474
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,340
What sickly liquid is this draining into the pool?

475
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,400
Trickling from a scum encrusted spout.

476
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,960
It's water, Anthony!

477
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,720
Chill out!

478
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
Anthony has never heard of water before.

479
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,920
Too medieval for him.

480
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,160
Wait, can I use the...

481
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Let's see.

482
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,090
You clumsy!

483
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:19,210
While fumbling around, the urn slips from Anthony's stiff fingers, dashing itself into fragments as it hits the floor.

484
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,490
Anthony picks up the broken...

485
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,030
Wait, we got a rune in there!

486
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,090
Wait, we got a rune in there!

487
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,350
Wait, maybe I was supposed to do that!

488
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,930
This one!

489
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,510
This one!

490
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,230
We still don't have that one.

491
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,330
We still don't have that one.

492
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,110
Wait, can I make a new spell?

493
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,210
I think I have enough...

494
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,410
Okay, everybody, I have enough components.

495
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,710
I have the components.

496
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:49,990
Oh!

497
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,470
Oh!

498
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,010
What did I make?

499
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,970
Oh.

500
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,100
I don't think I'm doing it correctly.

501
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,700
Uh...

502
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,340
Spell 1!

503
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,660
Spell 1!

504
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,640
The effects of this spell are unknown.

505
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,420
Not all of its components are in your possession or have been identified.

506
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,800
Spell 1, baby!

507
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,910
We'll put spell 1...

508
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,910
Oh, uh...

509
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,930
Spell...

510
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,010
We're gonna assign spell 1...

511
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,010
to here.

512
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,410
Yeah!

513
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,520
Good job, Anthony!

514
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,160
One.

515
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,260
Spell 1...

516
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,320
Spell 1...

517
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,760
Back away from last.

518
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Dangerous.

519
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,040
Cast it?

520
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,580
Oh, what if it's like a...

521
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:21,800
Okay.

522
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,960
Oh!

523
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
Wait, but I...

524
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,680
Oh, select an item to enchant?

525
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,740
Scrassmasax?

526
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,640
Oh!

527
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,630
This magic...

528
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,810
magic meter represents a character's magical energy.

529
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,850
When a spell is cast, the level will get lower.

530
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,330
This meter regenerates whenever the character is in motion.

531
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,410
May the rats eat your eyes!

532
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,310
The darkness comes!

533
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,270
It will damn us all!

534
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,450
The rats!

535
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:56,830
The rats!

536
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,210
The rats!

537
00:25:59,130 --> 00:25:59,930
Oh my gosh.

538
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,510
Okay.

539
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,430
Let's go... Okay, Anthony, you look really bad.

540
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,950
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,050
Oh.

542
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,710
This guy's really big!

543
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:10,810
Oh!

544
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,450
Oh my god!

545
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,030
Oh my god!

546
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,090
Hey!

547
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,870
Chill out!

548
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,250
Chill out!

549
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,890
Chill out!

550
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,590
Chill out!

551
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,350
Chill out!

552
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,010
Chill out!

553
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,850
Chill out!

554
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,590
Chill out!

555
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,390
Okay.

556
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,870
God!

557
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,800
It's still enchanting.

558
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,080
I don't know what it's doing.

559
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,060
I think it's working.

560
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,200
Wait

561
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:46,880
for me!

562
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,560
I'm coming to...

563
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,800
What if you check it now?

564
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,420
Oh, good idea.

565
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,280
This Frank and Saxon weapon relies on a hefty blade to deliver deadly cutting and slashing attacks.

566
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,600
It does not have a handguard, as it was designed for offensive rather than defensive fighting.

567
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,380
Don't blame Anthony.

568
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,220
He's only ever had ale and beer since his mother weaned him.

569
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,560
Oh!

570
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,500
It opened for us!

571
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:16,840
Oh!

572
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,780
Ah!

573
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,900
I see, I see.

574
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,800
So when we step on the platform...

575
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,000
An ancient stone tablet leans against the bookshelf.

576
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah!

577
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,400
Ale!

578
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,860
Yo, wait, what's that down there?

579
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,800
Oh, that's the blinking of my sword.

580
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,900
He's only ever had ale and beer.

581
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
I've been entertained by your mods for years now.

582
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,620
I'm finally tuning in live for Eternal Darkness.

583
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,000
Thanks for entertaining me all these years.

584
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,580
Thank you!

585
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,620
Amongst the books on the table rests an ancient scroll of what appears to be paper.

586
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,700
Enchant Item.

587
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,260
Oh!

588
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,020
Way ahead of you, game.

589
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,360
Cinderathalos, thanks for the 10 gifts!

590
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,760
I am way ahead of you.

591
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,620
I am so way ahead of you.

592
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,060
This allows the player to cast spells that have been found or researched.

593
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,440
Selecting this allows players to assign their most used spells to a button.

594
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,760
This will enable the casting of spells without having to choose them from the book each time.

595
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,120
Through this function, the player can examine the contents of each spell scroll that has been acquired.

596
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh!

597
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,760
That which is broken shall be fixed.

598
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,800
That which is dull will be sharp.

599
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,740
Thus is the nature of the Enchant Item magic.

600
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,660
Oh, it's sharper now!

601
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,320
This spell requires Antorbock.

602
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,640
They sound like Pokemon for real.

603
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,780
Antorbock!

604
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,660
Magimor!

605
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,960
Okay.

606
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,440
I've already done it.

607
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,920
Thank you.

608
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,640
Oh no, it's taking me through the tutorial.

609
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,340
No, please let me out!

610
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,920
Let me out!

611
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
I can't...

612
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,100
Okay.

613
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,060
I'm gonna have to assign it there as well.

614
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay, now I can leave.

615
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
Anthony, are you okay?

616
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,440
You're looking mighty green, buddy.

617
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,380
You're looking so bad.

618
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,800
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the super chats!

619
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Thank you so much!

620
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,120
Finally got a job after being un-slash-underemployed for eleven and a half months!

621
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,560
Holy cow, cuddly.

622
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,320
Your streams are so helpful in keeping me motivated in tough times.

623
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,480
So happy I can afford to super my OC now.

624
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:37,720
No!

625
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,920
Save it!

626
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,380
You deserve it!

627
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,020
You earned it!

628
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,460
I want you to remember the Pokemon rules when it comes to your spells.

629
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:46,820
Oh!

630
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,320
Was that...

631
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,300
OBS?

632
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,060
I don't know what just went...

633
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,040
Am I still streaming?

634
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,900
That's what ties into three colored bars your character has.

635
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,000
Wait, what?

636
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,300
Pokemon rules.

637
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,360
I'm here?

638
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,120
I don't know what just happened.

639
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,980
Oh, sorry.

640
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Wait, what did it say?

641
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,320
Religious texts on unspeakable nature, written in languages utterable only by monsters or corrupt humans.

642
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,580
Okay.

643
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,600
Open that up.

644
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,960
And now run for it, Anthony!

645
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,700
Run for it!

646
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,100
The bishop passed through the secret door.

647
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,320
There has to be a way to get through it.

648
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,950
Anthony, you look so dead.

649
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,320
Do I need...

650
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,220
some...

651
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,420
It looks like...

652
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,400
Mamito Gaming.

653
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,840
What else can you enchant?

654
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,420
Oh!

655
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,740
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

656
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,500
The things that we needed to be fixed.

657
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,980
Then also this one.

658
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,410
Wait, how's my magic looking?

659
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,410
Oh, it doesn't drain that much.

660
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,270
Although the urn appears to sit correctly in place of the pressure plate, it does not appear to be heavy enough.

661
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,730
We gotta go get the water.

662
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,010
We gotta...

663
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,550
Okay, Anthony.

664
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,150
Anthony, you look so...

665
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:45,670
buddy.

666
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,030
I'm really concerned for you.

667
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,250
He doesn't look good at all.

668
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,070
He looks like he's about to...

669
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,050
keel over.

670
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,590
There's something in here, right?

671
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,170
Yeah, okay.

672
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,670
Use!

673
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,970
Dunking the urn into the foul-smelling fountain, it becomes filled to the brim with rank fluid.

674
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,810
It is a lot heavier now, and rife with...

675
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,450
pho-tor.

676
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:26,910
Fetter?

677
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,570
Pho-fetter?

678
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,970
All right, let's get going.

679
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:32,670
And here it goes!

680
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,550
Thank you so much!

681
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,050
Let's all be reckless with our money.

682
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,590
Now!

683
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,450
Oh my gosh, Anthony.

684
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,270
Now!

685
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,150
I love your laugh.

686
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,490
Thanks.

687
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,150
Use...

688
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,250
Wait, wait, what do you mean?

689
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,250
It's not heavy enough.

690
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,190
Wait, all three of them will be heavy.

691
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,750
All three of them will be heavy enough.

692
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,310
It means stinky.

693
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:09,810
Ew!

694
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,390
It like...

695
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:18,830
just panning over to the already open door and like making the sound as if it like, you know...

696
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,230
Ooh, it's kind of spooky in here.

697
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,410
As if, you know, it wasn't already open.

698
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,630
Okay.

699
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,370
Am I gonna have to...

700
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,710
Wait!

701
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,210
I just noticed!

702
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,350
I'm gonna make it sharp!

703
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,790
I heard we're being reckless with our money.

704
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,910
I don't think so.

705
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,810
Oh!

706
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,630
Wait, he's alive.

707
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,570
Oh, no he's not.

708
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,710
I've come to return my book.

709
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,610
Very well, then.

710
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,570
For your efforts...

711
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,750
He looks kinda like me.

712
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,390
...a quick and merciful death.

713
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,130
No!

714
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,930
Oh!

715
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,730
Oh my god!

716
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,910
He's the guy!

717
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,110
Oh my god!

718
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,190
Oh my god!

719
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,950
Oh, gosh.

720
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:08,510
Oh, gosh.

721
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,770
Get him!

722
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,430
Get his ass!

723
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,070
Get his ass!

724
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,290
Oh my god, run away!

725
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,430
Run away!

726
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,070
Oh my god, run!

727
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,750
Cut off his arm, please!

728
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,530
Oh, I got one of his arms!

729
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:31,370
Nice!

730
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:31,870
I got his arm!

731
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,550
I thought he was gonna be a good guy...

732
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,810
You're not a good guy at all!

733
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,350
Finish him!

734
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,870
Finish him!

735
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,550
Finish him!

736
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,090
Uh-oh.

737
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,630
Uh-oh.

738
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:48,910
Oh!

739
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,610
Oh!

740
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:51,990
Shoot!

741
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,110
Oh, there we go.

742
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,490
Anyway...

743
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,610
Run away?

744
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,170
Get his arm!

745
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,610
Get his arm!

746
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,790
Get his ass!

747
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,130
Hoo!

748
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,430
Hoo!

749
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,150
The jukes!

750
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,590
Hahaha!

751
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,950
Ah!

752
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,010
Go, Anthony!

753
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,610
Go, Anthony!

754
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,250
Get Anthony!

755
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,590
Anthony, my buddy!

756
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,310
Ew.

757
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,490
The Charlemagne's gonna see us and be like...

758
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,910
This is...

759
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,130
That doesn't seem like a good place.

760
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,510
What if we do put the book there, though?

761
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:32,810
Oh!

762
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:39,730
A shrine to a god that bespeaks of an ancient evil that graced the earth before mankind walked its valleys.

763
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,330
I'm gonna put the book there.

764
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,230
I'm gonna put the book there.

765
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:44,990
Oh, never mind.

766
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,390
I can't.

767
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,910
Touch the pedestal?

768
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,310
I'm trying.

769
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,210
Won't let me.

770
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,350
Do I go this way?

771
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,110
I guess now that we have the bishop key, we go back to Charlemagne?

772
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,370
Is that the door that it opens?

773
00:35:59,530 --> 00:35:59,930
Oh!

774
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,470
Oh, god.

775
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:02,870
Anthony!

776
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:03,970
Anthony!

777
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,310
Oh, my god.

778
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:06,950
Anthony, no!

779
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,350
He looks like...

780
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,230
Charlemagne's gonna kill us.

781
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:10,510
Ah!

782
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,470
Holy!

783
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,390
Spooked me like crazy!

784
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,730
Yeah, take that!

785
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,490
Charlemagne's gonna kill me.

786
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,970
He kinda reminds me of...

787
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,510
I don't know.

788
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,530
For some reason...

789
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,830
The Sims or something.

790
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,110
I should've known.

791
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,690
I should've known.

792
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,410
I should've known.

793
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,990
Let's just get out of here, Anthony.

794
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,770
We don't need to fight.

795
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,390
Don't be greedy.

796
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,850
Who's coming at me?

797
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,790
What the hell is that?

798
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,310
Um...

799
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,410
Maybe it's a friend?

800
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,590
Yeah.

801
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,250
What?

802
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,870
I was just looking at Mokopis earlier and they look like a Mokopi.

803
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:33,010
The Trapper Dimension sprawls in every direction Whilst in this place magic cannot be cast And humans are subjected to odd phenomena The portals cycle from color to color As time progresses And only the quick will escape Um...

804
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,670
Um...

805
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,610
What?

806
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,610
Do I need to go to the blue light over there?

807
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,130
Oh.

808
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,490
Oh, shoot.

809
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,170
Not the red one.

810
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,070
Blue?

811
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm in the shadow realm.

812
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,030
For real.

813
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,230
Okay.

814
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,070
Let's go to the blue!

815
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:53,810
Oh, shoot.

816
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,490
There's a guy there.

817
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:56,890
It's okay.

818
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,190
I can get his ass.

819
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,290
Oh.

820
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,790
All I know how to do is hit rocks, man.

821
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,010
Get his arm!

822
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,230
Come on, his arm!

823
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:08,890
Wah!

824
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,390
Thank you!

825
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,510
Oh, wait.

826
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,390
My Dono's thing...

827
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,630
Hold on.

828
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,210
My Dono's thing is all my...

829
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,490
I messed up.

830
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,590
Wait, I can't see it!

831
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,970
Refresh.

832
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,230
Uh-oh.

833
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,690
Oh, no.

834
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,270
Oh, there it is.

835
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,510
Wait.

836
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,470
There it is.

837
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,150
Everything is acting weird today.

838
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,470
I'm the ultimate wizard.

839
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,170
Slaps you limply with his arms.

840
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,670
That urn looks as good as new.

841
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,410
So true.

842
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,030
Okay.

843
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,530
There we go.

844
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,950
I think this is how I get out.

845
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,410
This looks healthy.

846
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,110
Oh!

847
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,690
Never mind.

848
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,070
I lied.

849
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,910
Uh, what's purple?

850
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,010
That looks like an exit.

851
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,210
For sure.

852
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,990
That has to be an exit.

853
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,970
Get out of here, Anthony!

854
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,490
You're turning into a zombie!

855
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,400
Yay!

856
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,200
Okay, so...

857
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,860
Avoid the scorpions, I guess?

858
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,260
Trappers have no eyes, but can sense sound very well.

859
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,580
If Anthony can sneak past them, they won't be troubled.

860
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,260
How

861
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,180
quiet.

862
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,680
Sneaking mission real.

863
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,180
Hit the door.

864
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh my gosh, don't come this way.

865
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,100
I'm moving one pixel at a time.

866
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,640
Oh.

867
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,700
Yay!

868
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,760
Ah!

869
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,500
Oh my god.

870
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,460
Get the other guy!

871
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,500
Oh my god, there's three of them.

872
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,140
Oh gosh.

873
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,920
Kill them all!

874
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,320
Just strike them dead!

875
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,180
I wish I could get his head.

876
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,940
Yeah, there we go.

877
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,780
Take him out.

878
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,540
Enchant wore off.

879
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,260
We'll do it.

880
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,140
We'll fix it.

881
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,880
Okay.

882
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,200
La la la.

883
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,320
I don't think...

884
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,660
Surely, Charlemagne will be fine.

885
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,440
And there will be nothing that is attacking him.

886
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,100
I believe.

887
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,760
Oh yeah, let's do our magic.

888
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
Enchant our sword.

889
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,320
Oh, I forgot!

890
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,540
I should be using my torch instead.

891
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,980
The torch is kind of awesome.

892
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
Anybody here?

893
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,780
Not even a poor, sad, dead bishop.

894
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,120
Oh god, Anthony.

895
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,260
Oh no!

896
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,260
No, no, no!

897
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,060
Oh god, Anthony!

898
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,500
Even his hair is graying.

899
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,880
Even his hair is graying.

900
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh gosh, buddy.

901
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,280
Oh.

902
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,000
He doesn't like the light.

903
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,100
Oh, he doesn't like the light.

904
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh, interesting.

905
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,820
Okay, I'll re-equip my sword then.

906
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,540
Oh!

907
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,480
Cool!

908
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,880
He might be me.

909
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,580
Casually returns to the world of the living looking like this.

910
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,280
Casually returns to the world of the living looking like this.

911
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,420
Oh buddy, I think you're...

912
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,540
Oh!

913
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,080
Oh!

914
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,680
Oh!

915
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,420
What the...

916
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,420
Oh!

917
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,480
No!

918
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,760
You can go back down the ladder.

919
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,940
Thank you.

920
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes, save and continue.

921
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,860
Okay, we're good.

922
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,780
It's the same picture.

923
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,180
I think it's still fine though, right?

924
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,960
It did save though, right?

925
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,940
Three hours and...

926
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
What do you mean, cheater?

927
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,380
It's again?

928
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,520
What do you mean, cheater?

929
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,060
What do you mean, cheater?

930
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,720
Cheater to anything.

931
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:08,860
Okay.

932
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,640
The time did change.

933
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,140
Okay, great.

934
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,660
Um, holy shoot.

935
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,240
Ah!

936
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh my god!

937
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,840
Oh my gosh.

938
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,260
Wait.

939
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,720
Oh.

940
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,400
Oh my god.

941
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,200
My game is in reverse.

942
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,160
Wait.

943
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,620
Or something?

944
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,140
What's happening?

945
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,380
No!

946
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:24,980
Oh!

947
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,800
Run!

948
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,560
Ouch!

949
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,660
Oh gosh!

950
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,540
What's happening?

951
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,440
Do I do...

952
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,120
Magic?

953
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,220
Where's this torch?

954
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,480
Equip this instead maybe?

955
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,140
Do you like this?

956
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,940
Take that!

957
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,940
I'm gonna die.

958
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm about to die.

959
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,940
I'm about to die.

960
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,020
I cut off a piece of him.

961
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm examining the...

962
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,680
How am I still alive?

963
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,900
Oh gosh.

964
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,310
I don't know what's happening.

965
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,170
How am I still alive?

966
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,550
Oh!

967
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,550
Oh my god.

968
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,310
Ouch!

969
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,990
Oh my god.

970
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,650
The controls here are very weird.

971
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:35,750
Oh!

972
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,250
I killed him!

973
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,930
I don't know how...

974
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,590
I don't know how I won!

975
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,290
Let's go!

976
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,280
Zero sanity.

977
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,500
Not anymore!

978
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:48,580
Not anymore!

979
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,540
Whoo!

980
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,560
Anthony, are you okay?

981
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,830
Oh shit!

982
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,630
Ah!

983
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,110
Wait!

984
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:02,530
Ah!

985
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,150
No!

986
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,650
No!

987
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,510
Please!

988
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,800
Anthony, are you okay?

989
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,460
Wait...

990
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,920
Was that part of the sanity?

991
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Was that...

992
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,140
Part of the...

993
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,980
I even... I turned my control on and off.

994
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,740
That was a sanity effect?

995
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,400
No way!

996
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,260
Oh my god.

997
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,740
What?

998
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,000
Ah!

999
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,760
Ouch!

1000
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,700
Don't kill me, please.

1001
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,900
Please, don't kill me.

1002
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,800
Oh my gosh.

1003
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,260
Maybe I should have saved after...

1004
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1005
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,500
Please!

1006
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,600
Ouch!

1007
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,400
Run away!

1008
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:02,840
Anthony!

1009
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:02,940
Anthony!

1010
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,780
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to...

1011
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,920
survive.

1012
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,400
Hold on.

1013
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:10,900
You know what?

1014
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,400
It'll be fine.

1015
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,620
I am gonna save.

1016
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,360
But...

1017
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,600
We'll save in this slot.

1018
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,060
Just save and continue.

1019
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,400
Okay, there we go.

1020
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:20,740
Okay.

1021
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,860
The torch.

1022
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,360
You're right.

1023
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:23,840
You're right.

1024
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,460
The torch would be better here, I think.

1025
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah, and then we'll just switch it over.

1026
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,180
What the?

1027
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,220
He's tiny!

1028
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,440
He's teeny tiny, skinny man!

1029
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,240
Oh

1030
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:50,690
my god.

1031
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,570
But it's not letting me...

1032
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,330
finish them.

1033
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,750
I think they're too small.

1034
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,090
Oh!

1035
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,650
The game!

1036
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:57,910
Ah!

1037
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,470
Is it really happening?

1038
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:01,730
Oh.

1039
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,390
It's not?

1040
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:02,950
Wait.

1041
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,590
What's hap...

1042
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,210
Yeah!

1043
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:14,810
Oh gosh.

1044
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:15,150
Oh gosh.

1045
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:15,950
Anthony, don't die.

1046
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,320
Okay.

1047
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,080
What's going on?

1048
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,580
What's happening?

1049
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,860
Oh my god!

1050
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,540
So when something is actually happening, it...

1051
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,200
I... um...

1052
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,220
I'm fine.

1053
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
I can continue forward.

1054
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,700
But something's not actually happening.

1055
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,500
My sanity's being crazy crazy.

1056
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,660
Oh my god.

1057
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,040
Even the...

1058
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,240
the... the... the tilt.

1059
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,280
Um...

1060
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,320
Okay.

1061
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,220
Alright.

1062
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,100
The bishop's key.

1063
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:52,660
We have it.

1064
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,100
We have it.

1065
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:56,060
Ooh!

1066
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,840
...a

1067
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,550
fool for trying to save him, Anthony.

1068
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:19,150
His fate was decided many centuries ago, as is the fate of this world.

1069
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,670
Colonel?

1070
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,810
Despite your faith, there is little to save you from the power of...

1071
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,030
Oh my god!

1072
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,290
Was that Roy Campbell?

1073
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,410
Oh my gosh.

1074
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,910
Colonel jumpscare was so funny.

1075
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,570
Anthony turned the game console off right now.

1076
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,150
That's literally...

1077
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,450
Oh my gosh.

1078
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,350
That's so funny.

1079
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,410
Okay.

1080
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,950
We're back as... as she.

1081
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,530
Oh gosh.

1082
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,450
Wait.

1083
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,230
Can I do spells now?

1084
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,530
...

1085
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:13,630
...

1086
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:14,930
...

1087
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:15,010
...

1088
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,010
I can!

1089
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,410
So what I learned...

1090
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:20,630
...

1091
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,690
Anthony was liquid!

1092
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,890
Oh yes, I do remember that!

1093
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,010
I swear to god, I heard...

1094
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,710
There is... there is little to save you from the power of Shadow Moses.

1095
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:30,610
...

1096
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,870
We're all... we're all so brain-rotted.

1097
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,310
Oh gosh.

1098
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:36,810
Oh neat!

1099
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,610
So now...

1100
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,450
Okay, cool!

1101
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,830
My sanity is getting a little freaky.

1102
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,710
Second floor key!

1103
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,210
Let's go!

1104
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:46,510
...

1105
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,150
...

1106
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,030
What's that?

1107
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:51,930
...

1108
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:54,800
Here?

1109
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,580
...

1110
00:49:59,410 --> 00:49:59,830
...

1111
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,530
I'm scared!

1112
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,930
Okay, the game is actually starting to scare me.

1113
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,150
Hold on.

1114
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,970
I keep adjusting the audio a little bit.

1115
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,130
Because I think it's getting kind of loud.

1116
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,110
...

1117
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:16,410
...

1118
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,310
What you learn in the book, you learn in real life!

1119
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,370
I'm reading!

1120
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,450
I'm reading!

1121
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,210
...

1122
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,110
Oh gosh.

1123
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,010
... Thank you!

1124
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,810
The entire VA cast for this is just an MGS reunion.

1125
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:31,510
...

1126
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,730
I'm afraid of Skellyman coming out of somewhere.

1127
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,930
...

1128
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,590
I'm afraid of having to fight.

1129
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,530
...

1130
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,110
My sanity is not that low!

1131
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,150
...

1132
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,470
Hamburger...

1133
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,450
Bang, bang, bang.

1134
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,330
Ma'am, we're here to talk about your car's warranty.

1135
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,350
Wait, is it the front door?

1136
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:54,850
Hello?

1137
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:00,850
Okay.

1138
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,090
Weird things are going on in this place.

1139
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,210
I mean, weird things have been going on.

1140
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:07,790
Oh, is it this door?

1141
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,410
...

1142
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:11,950
Uh oh.

1143
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,350
Wait, maybe we shouldn't.

1144
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:14,650
...

1145
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,250
Like AOL sound of the door closing.

1146
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:20,810
...

1147
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,410
...

1148
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,610
Oh, what's this on the ground?

1149
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,230
Oh, that's not what I thought I was examining.

1150
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:27,410
Oh, this is a forest?

1151
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:27,790
Okay.

1152
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,370
This is a horse?

1153
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,530
How can my Yoshi be this spooky?

1154
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,550
Whoa, what was that?

1155
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:34,790
Did you guys see that?

1156
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:35,990
There was like blood or something!

1157
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,130
...

1158
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,590
...

1159
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:38,690
...

1160
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,870
Time has taken its toll on the surface which is...

1161
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,990
which is soiled with dirt and scratches.

1162
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,630
Us skellies are afraid of ghosts as well, so we're even.

1163
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,690
Wait, you didn't see it?

1164
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:52,970
Okay.

1165
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,690
Oh, wait!

1166
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,370
No!

1167
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,290
You guys, it's right there!

1168
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,050
And also, this guy was looking at me funny!

1169
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,550
Hello?

1170
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,090
We're just not gonna...

1171
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,590
We're not even gonna address it?

1172
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,350
... Huh?

1173
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,070
We're just...

1174
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,630
Okay.

1175
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,150
We're just not even gonna talk about that one.

1176
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:17,650
That's fine.

1177
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,830
I'm looking up at something.

1178
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,310
What am I looking up at?

1179
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,030
What are you looking up at?

1180
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,540
Everything's bleeding.

1181
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,550
Everything's bleeding.

1182
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:40,810
Grandpa?

1183
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,430
You seem a little paranoid.

1184
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,410
Just maybe...

1185
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:44,850
I don't know.

1186
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:46,570
Detail.

1187
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,710
Alright.

1188
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,570
Ooh!

1189
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,720
Some runes!

1190
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:16,940
One of the drawers in the dresser curiously has no keyhole, and it places a small triangular design flanked by a magical symbol.

1191
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,380
What does it mean?

1192
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,180
So I need to get that...

1193
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,180
Oh, the bathroom.

1194
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,540
There's a note in here.

1195
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,590
Oh, Journal of Maximilian Ruyvis!

1196
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,910
When are you going to start playing the game you've been staring all this time?

1197
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,650
Are you muted?

1198
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,010
That would be so freaky.

1199
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,040
Do I have this one?

1200
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,260
Let's check my spells.

1201
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,940
My runes.

1202
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,420
I don't have these runes.

1203
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,960
Oh my gosh.

1204
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,200
Legendary spells.

1205
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:30,260
I don't care.

1206
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,100
Okay.

1207
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,740
Wait!

1208
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,940
Was this here?

1209
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,140
Was this swan here before?

1210
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,340
This guy just staring at me.

1211
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,280
Okay.

1212
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,940
Maybe so.

1213
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,000
What about you?

1214
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,400
Grandpa!

1215
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,560
Really good screams today.

1216
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,280
I think it's because I'm tired.

1217
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,860
This place is so big.

1218
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,420
Napoleon.

1219
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,500
Oh!

1220
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,040
A chapter page has been hastily stashed behind the frame of this painting.

1221
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,220
Should Alex retrieve...

1222
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,460
Yes?

1223
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,700
The gift of forever!

1224
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,300
Oh yeah, we also have to read the...

1225
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,560
The journal entry?

1226
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,720
Let's see.

1227
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:22,820
Check.

1228
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,100
This is a page from Maximilian Ruyvis' journal.

1229
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,920
It reads, Everything that brightened my life now engulfs me in darkness.

1230
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,320
I fed on the light of truth, yet starved on the shadows of lies.

1231
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:44,620
I have learned through my lifetime, but no less than a newborn baby.

1232
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,100
That's exactly how I feel right now.

1233
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,100
The gift of forever.

1234
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,320
I want to keep exploring a little bit more before we go into the next chapter.

1235
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,000
A musty aroma hangs in the air and a layer of fine dust...

1236
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,860
Mike Tyson's ass!

1237
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,820
Oh, sorry.

1238
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,500
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

1239
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,420
Thanks for the fine gift!

1240
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,320
Yesterday were good too.

1241
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,660
She literally screamed for ice cream.

1242
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,160
A layer of fine dust lies on all the surface of the room.

1243
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,700
It seems as if no one has been in here for a long time.

1244
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,440
It's almost like a museum.

1245
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,420
It belongs in a museum.

1246
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:24,500
Damn.

1247
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,440
We got some revolver ammunition?

1248
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,360
Uh-oh.

1249
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1250
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,440
My sanity is not so low for it to be turning the screen like that.

1251
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,120
My sanity is not so low for you to twist the camera around, okay?

1252
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,220
Six shots.

1253
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,260
Why does it allow you to look at everything?

1254
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,500
Why does it allow you to look at everything?

1255
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,100
I don't know.

1256
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,440
Grandpa?

1257
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,090
Can I also just walk through?

1258
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:19,950
The wallpaper in this section of the hallway is oddly marred as though the wall it sits on is not even with the rest of the room.

1259
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,390
Oh.

1260
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:21,870
Uh.

1261
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,310
Never mind.

1262
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,570
Great grandpa.

1263
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,230
Snail.

1264
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:31,670
I was wrong about that.

1265
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,570
It's too dark in here to do anything.

1266
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,850
Perhaps the circuit has been broken.

1267
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,470
Glad it left for us.

1268
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,450
Just push it.

1269
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,290
Just do something!

1270
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,550
You can do it!

1271
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,030
Just...

1272
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,930
Just do something with it.

1273
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,770
Just do something!

1274
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:04,730
What?

1275
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,610
Somebody's hungry!

1276
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:09,390
Oh!

1277
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,130
Oh my gosh!

1278
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,150
There's a rune there!

1279
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,410
I didn't even notice that.

1280
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,510
I couldn't touch it.

1281
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,670
The stained glass depicts a glowing medieval maiden.

1282
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,990
Luminous.

1283
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,330
Even with the faint light of the setting sun.

1284
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,310
Setting sun.

1285
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,490
The maiden clasps a piece of parchment.

1286
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,970
The widow gives Alex a strange feeling.

1287
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,590
Almost as if it is magical.

1288
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:37,610
Not really there.

1289
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,870
A glowing field of energy protects the window.

1290
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:42,490
Okay.

1291
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,390
Oh!

1292
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,590
If you get real close to it...

1293
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:50,210
The Sutting said.

1294
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,430
I like her idle animation.

1295
00:58:58,850 --> 00:58:59,370
That's fun.

1296
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:00,810
Okay.

1297
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,790
There was one other thing I wanted to check before we...

1298
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:06,510
Um...

1299
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,350
Before we do the next chapter.

1300
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,410
And that's this door.

1301
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:18,930
Does this look different?

1302
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,530
No, I think he looks the same.

1303
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,050
Never mind.

1304
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:22,550
Okay.

1305
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,510
I think I'm getting really paranoid.

1306
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,550
Is the door...

1307
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,790
Was it in here?

1308
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:30,250
Yes.

1309
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,630
This is I think the same rune that's on the dresser.

1310
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,070
Okay.

1311
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,430
Okay.

1312
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,410
Stop it.

1313
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:43,730
Stop it.

1314
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,150
Alright.

1315
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,870
Let's go to the gift of forever.

1316
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,170
Who are we now?

1317
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:51,470
Dreams.

1318
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:51,750
Dreams.

1319
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,490
Modern psychology offers only unproven theories.

1320
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,010
Some see them as the meaningless tossing and turning of a brain...

1321
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,710
settling into a restful sleep.

1322
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:06,490
Others see them as laden with symbols of our unconscious desires.

1323
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:12,370
To still others, dreams represent the upwelling of the archetypes...

1324
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:16,110
normally hidden deep within the recesses of the human collected unconscious.

1325
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,530
Of one thing I am certain.

1326
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,810
After a brush with the ancients...

1327
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:26,150
our dreams metamorphosize into nightmares.

1328
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:26,790
Wait.

1329
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,210
565 AD?

1330
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,590
We went back in time?

1331
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,390
We're in Persia.

1332
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,080
Oh no.

1333
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,220
Get this guy some water.

1334
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,880
He's gonna start hallucinating.

1335
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,650
I have implored you for years.

1336
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,110
Yet you ignore all my advances.

1337
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,690
You dominate my dreams.

1338
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:56,330
Wow.

1339
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,190
And I can think of nothing else.

1340
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:04,250
I fear I desire you many hundred times more than you love me.

1341
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,630
My life has become a woe to me.

1342
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,130
No wonder he's desiring her!

1343
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:27,390
If you truly desire me, as you say, then you will find this for me.

1344
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:32,070
Bring this treasure to me and I will be yours.

1345
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,730
Both of our dreams will come true.

1346
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,410
She's just like Kaguya!

1347
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,450
I need nothing more than you.

1348
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,190
Oh my god.

1349
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:45,310
You have enthralled me to the point where I can think of nothing else.

1350
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,710
This guy is suffering from Symposis.

1351
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,790
You will not forget about me.

1352
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:51,690
I think she will.

1353
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,590
You need not worry.

1354
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:56,650
I desire nothing more than the treasure that you seek.

1355
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,970
Leave now, Karim.

1356
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,730
And I shall await you.

1357
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,130
He's dreaming of her.

1358
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:04,790
Symp!

1359
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,130
Symp!

1360
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:05,590
Symp!

1361
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,510
He's like, this has got to be it.

1362
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,930
Oh no, there's guys all around here!

1363
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,990
Uh oh, they're going to start attacking me.

1364
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,670
Good job!

1365
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,650
You made it!

1366
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,170
Oh, what do I have?

1367
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:35,730
What is this?

1368
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,910
Talisman.

1369
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:41,170
An ancient talisman that has been in Karim's family for many generations.

1370
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,350
It is said to bestow long life on those who have kept it.

1371
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,170
This item can be used to restore health.

1372
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,030
And chakrams.

1373
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:56,770
The chakram was a favorite throwing weapon through central Asia in medieval times.

1374
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:05,430
Karim isn't voiced by anyone from Metal Gear, but the girl he's simping for is voiced by Laughing Octopus!

1375
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:06,930
No way!

1376
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,430
A balanced ring of metal, sometimes beautifully decorated.

1377
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,770
It would be hurled at an attacker.

1378
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:22,650
Heavy chakrams could sever limbs or heads.

1379
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,210
However, they were not designed to return to the thrower.

1380
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,530
Oh, well, that's kind of...

1381
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,250
But, what I can do...

1382
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,710
Oh, I need the Tome of Eternal Darkness first!

1383
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:37,210
Can I get that axe?

1384
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,670
Let me get that axe, though.

1385
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,040
A man's corpse lasts forever.

1386
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,460
His eyes fallen.

1387
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,580
Wounds cover the exposed flesh of his body, where his armor has failed.

1388
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,000
Why is the music so... loud?

1389
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,600
He's just dead.

1390
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,380
The big guy and then the tiny little guy right next to him is so funny.

1391
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,780
Sounds spooky down there!

1392
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,240
Oh,

1393
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,150
let's get our Tome!

1394
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,630
Yay, I'm walking on you!

1395
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,290
Oh, my gosh.

1396
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,810
This is what I should do for you guys.

1397
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,290
If you're just like, gosh, I wish Mint would step on me.

1398
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,370
Actually, any VTuber.

1399
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,210
Like, I wish VTuber would step on me.

1400
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,690
Just line up.

1401
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:42,890
There you go!

1402
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:52,240
Built in what appears to be a leathery hand lies...

1403
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:53,860
Excuse me!

1404
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,520
A mysterious book!

1405
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:59,080
It is bound in human skin and intricately decorated.

1406
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,000
Excuse me!

1407
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,160
With shrunken bones, it beckons and yearns to be possessed!

1408
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,120
Yes!

1409
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,920
Take the Tome!

1410
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:10,820
Uh-oh.

1411
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,360
They woke up.

1412
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:13,740
Whoa!

1413
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,040
That's a lot of guys.

1414
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,500
Whoa!

1415
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,620
That's a lot of guys!

1416
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,760
Let's enchant my sword.

1417
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,340
It didn't work!

1418
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,900
Because I went outside the runes!

1419
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,840
Interesting.

1420
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,280
Okay.

1421
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,260
Oh!

1422
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:35,790
Oh my gosh!

1423
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,050
Run!

1424
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:36,750
Run!

1425
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:37,830
Yeah, let them fight!

1426
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:38,790
Let them...

1427
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,230
Let them...

1428
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,930
Take care of...

1429
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:40,010
Oh.

1430
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:41,550
Uh...

1431
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:07,550
Finish him!

1432
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,160
I think I got him.

1433
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,080
There we go.

1434
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,300
Because he's made of bones!

1435
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,000
Is this like a skele...

1436
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,100
Oh man, I missed out.

1437
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,500
Can I leave?

1438
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,240
Or...

1439
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,540
What do you want me to do now, game?

1440
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,700
Do I go back down?

1441
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,760
Oh, okay.

1442
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,280
Okay.

1443
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,120
What is that?

1444
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,880
Are these guys gonna come alive?

1445
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:02,510
Yes, come over.

1446
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,610
I didn't realize...

1447
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:06,670
Oh!

1448
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,470
I didn't realize that like...

1449
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,070
Getting their head was so powerful.

1450
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,990
I always thought getting the arms was better.

1451
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,490
He wasn't tiny.

1452
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:17,470
He was average-sized.

1453
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,210
Yeah.

1454
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,570
He was smaller than the rest, though.

1455
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:26,310
The statuette, vaguely resembling a man, stands atop a low pedestal.

1456
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:26,390
Oh!

1457
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:33,070
It looks like Gru from Despicable Me.

1458
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,450
Hurt his little feelings.

1459
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,870
I didn't mean to.

1460
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:41,650
Okay.

1461
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,890
I guess that guy is fine.

1462
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:44,290
Oh!

1463
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:47,630
Come here.

1464
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,090
Come here.

1465
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,590
Oh!

1466
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,090
Yeah.

1467
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:53,110
Yeah!

1468
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,620
Oh!

1469
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,100
Oh!

1470
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,800
He's got a brood!

1471
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:02,920
He's got a brood!

1472
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:03,100
Oh!

1473
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,280
Let's save.

1474
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:05,820
Thank you.

1475
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,620
Oh!

1476
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,480
He's confused.

1477
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,500
Oh!

1478
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:14,980
Oh!

1479
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,420
Oh!

1480
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:15,780
Oh!

1481
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,280
Oh, God.

1482
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,100
Am I good?

1483
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:19,820
Wait.

1484
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,200
What's happening?

1485
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:20,580
Oh!

1486
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,170
Violence is happening.

1487
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:25,790
Yeah!

1488
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:26,150
Yeah!

1489
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:29,030
He kills them so haphazardly.

1490
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,090
Let's see if I can save.

1491
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:33,810
If it'll let me.

1492
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:36,070
No!

1493
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:37,770
No!

1494
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,710
It won't let me save.

1495
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,850
It's too dangerous here.

1496
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,470
Still?

1497
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,010
Still too dangerous?

1498
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,250
Is anybody else alive?

1499
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:00,210
Darkness.

1500
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,590
I did Karim so dirty with this picture.

1501
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:08,150
Why is he the cross-eyed?

1502
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:11,190
Oh!

1503
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:11,370
Oh!

1504
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:11,590
Oh!

1505
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,610
What's going on here?

1506
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,370
I can't tell what's happening.

1507
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:17,790
Oh!

1508
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:19,710
Oh!

1509
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,490
Oh!

1510
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:20,750
Oh!

1511
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,350
The lanterns are...

1512
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,270
It's like a fire.

1513
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:25,770
Okay.

1514
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:26,390
Cool.

1515
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,810
We have to do this before we continue.

1516
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,610
What happens when you simp too much?

1517
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,450
You go cross-eyed?

1518
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,570
He's crazy in love, you guys.

1519
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,870
He's crazy in love.

1520
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,450
Oh!

1521
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:53,930
Oh, the top one.

1522
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:54,210
Okay.

1523
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,950
I'm actually...

1524
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,170
What is this puzzle?

1525
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:57,830
I have no idea.

1526
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:58,270
You know what?

1527
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,510
Let's go.

1528
01:09:58,530 --> 01:09:59,350
Let's examine it first.

1529
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,410
An arcane shrine dominates the room.

1530
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:11,950
Brassiers surround its edge, while a larger one tops its summit.

1531
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:20,070
No doubt each one would be filled with incense to facilitate prayer to insidious deities.

1532
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,110
Okay.

1533
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,600
Brassiers.

1534
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,380
I'm kind of confused.

1535
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,520
Oh, yes!

1536
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,400
We got the new rune!

1537
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,320
You're so right.

1538
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,580
Also, let's...

1539
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:46,800
Oh!

1540
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,620
We have this guy too!

1541
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,780
Seems particularly heavy for its size.

1542
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:51,960
Maybe...

1543
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,260
I wonder if it allows us to duplicate him.

1544
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,560
New spell!

1545
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,820
New spell!

1546
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:58,900
New spell!

1547
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,520
New spell!

1548
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,340
New spell!

1549
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:07,920
New spell!

1550
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,480
Item?

1551
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:10,220
Wait.

1552
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,280
Project?

1553
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,000
Item.

1554
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:19,560
Wait.

1555
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,440
This is the same one that I did before, isn't it?

1556
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,030
This one!

1557
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:30,930
No.

1558
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,690
Simping.

1559
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,190
Simping.

1560
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:33,750
All for nothing.

1561
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:34,010
No!

1562
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,310
He's gonna get the girl, I believe.

1563
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,450
Oh!

1564
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,840
Do I do it this way?

1565
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:49,540
No...

1566
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:54,860
Oh...

1567
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,080
I never get the girl!

1568
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,200
He's gonna get the girl!

1569
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:09,630
He's gonna get the girl!

1570
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:10,110
He's gonna get the girl.

1571
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:11,150
He's gonna get the girl.

1572
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:13,250
Wait, but there was nowhere else for me to go.

1573
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,830
Which is why I'm kinda confused.

1574
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,830
Or was there?

1575
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,450
La la la.

1576
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:28,830
Dead end.

1577
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,120
This guy will reanimate at any moment.

1578
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,850
There was nothing in the first room, right?

1579
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,470
I don't think so.

1580
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:55,980
Nothing.

1581
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,080
How is he supposed to get back?

1582
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,460
He's finding the treasure.

1583
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,880
And then he's gonna go back to her.

1584
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:09,030
Was there a combination I didn't do?

1585
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,410
Was there a combination?

1586
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:12,970
I can't.

1587
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,010
Oh wait.

1588
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:15,810
Oh no.

1589
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:16,230
Yeah.

1590
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,550
There's only these two rooms.

1591
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:24,030
He did all the combinations.

1592
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:24,530
Okay.

1593
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,020
Are you okay?

1594
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:32,640
Buster.

1595
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,300
Buster.

1596
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:34,820
Buster.

1597
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,580
Buster.

1598
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:36,900
Buster.

1599
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,540
Symbol on the barrier?

1600
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,260
I don't think I can grab it though, right?

1601
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,980
A chorus skating barrier blocks Karim's progress down the ladder.

1602
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,740
His shimmering energy creates the vision of a rune upon its surface.

1603
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,680
Oh I can't take him back!

1604
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:24,520
He's stuck there.

1605
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,020
I think.

1606
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,620
Oh no!

1607
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,640
Our statue!

1608
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,180
Rune order does not matter, only correct magics.

1609
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,280
Okay, okay.

1610
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,320
That's good to know as well.

1611
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:40,300
Huh?

1612
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,800
Oh wait.

1613
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,000
Oh, I just had to touch it.

1614
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,220
No way, it was so easy?

1615
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,400
What about this then?

1616
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,020
What was the point?

1617
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,080
What was the point?

1618
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:06,400
What was the point?

1619
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,400
What was the point?

1620
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:16,880
Okay.

1621
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,860
Where is the skelly?

1622
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,260
That's me.

1623
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,080
Oh.

1624
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,700
Oh

1625
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:42,060
shoot.

1626
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,660
Oh shoot.

1627
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,540
Take his head.

1628
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,380
Take his head.

1629
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,820
You.

1630
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,320
Take his head.

1631
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,480
No!

1632
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:50,200
Don't take this yet!

1633
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,440
Finish him!

1634
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,920
Finish him!

1635
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:57,820
Finish him!

1636
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,360
Yeah Karim!

1637
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:08,080
A statue vaguely resembling a man.

1638
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,760
Pick it up.

1639
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:13,900
Nice.

1640
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,400
And...

1641
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,740
I'll take that.

1642
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:26,570
Yay!

1643
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,070
Wait a second.

1644
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,790
Climb down again Karim.

1645
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:35,870
I have a question.

1646
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,500
You can take the torch!

1647
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,720
Nice!

1648
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:44,500
Hahaha!

1649
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,860
Oh my gosh.

1650
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,660
I'm gaming now for real.

1651
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,760
So now we can put...

1652
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,180
...

1653
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,000
...

1654
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,240
This is exactly what learning kanji is like.

1655
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:00,640
Hahaha!

1656
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,940
Oh, what is that?

1657
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,130
Karim, what did you do?

1658
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:14,570
Karim.

1659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:15,610
Karim.

1660
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,370
Karim, not good.

1661
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:18,970
Karim.

1662
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:20,370
Karim.

1663
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:22,170
Where do we go Karim?

1664
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,330
Where do we go with this...

1665
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:26,610
...with these guys all around here?

1666
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:31,750
Karim.

1667
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:33,630
Karim.

1668
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:34,330
Karim!

1669
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,310
We're gonna get attacked!

1670
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:42,570
No, no, no.

1671
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:43,470
Just a box.

1672
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,790
Just a box.

1673
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,430
Just a box.

1674
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,270
Just a box.

1675
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,750
I'm gonna go to the center.

1676
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:51,810
I'm gonna go to this thing.

1677
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,030
Yes!

1678
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:57,190
Just go.

1679
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,110
Just go Karim.

1680
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:58,970
Hahaha!

1681
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,290
We did it!

1682
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:04,630
Phew!

1683
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:09,580
Oh, okay.

1684
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,280
We can go back up if we feel like it.

1685
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,460
I'm walking with a purpose here.

1686
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:14,720
Go!

1687
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,520
Cover it!

1688
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:16,960
Who's that?

1689
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:20,940
Lucky!

1690
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:21,800
Hahaha!

1691
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,220
No comment.

1692
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,800
No comment.

1693
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,220
Oh!

1694
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:29,620
Whoa!

1695
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,560
Oh boy.

1696
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,020
Uh oh.

1697
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,120
Lying in a pool of cold blood is a dead soldier.

1698
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,940
He is a victim of an unseen battle.

1699
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,300
Perhaps this man died from the claws of the monsters of this place.

1700
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,040
It is difficult to tell.

1701
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,560
This guy's got his own little thing here.

1702
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,840
The man lies dead.

1703
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,960
Anointed in blood from the ravages of a Tollwar sword.

1704
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,940
The wounds deep in numerous seep fresh blood, precise yet powerful.

1705
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,640
The result of a man's actions, not a monster's.

1706
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,000
Wait a second.

1707
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,820
What's my sword?

1708
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,260
Oh, I have one too.

1709
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,460
But mine's also a Tollwar.

1710
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,140
Can I have both of them?

1711
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,200
Kareem!

1712
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,600
Can I dual wield?

1713
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,840
I'm kitty to real.

1714
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,160
Oh my gosh, look at me.

1715
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:28,980
Yo!

1716
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,160
Kareem is awesome so far!

1717
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,620
Hahaha!

1718
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,960
Someone asked, maybe I should change up the brightness.

1719
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,660
I'm going to make it a little bit brighter for you guys, just in case.

1720
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,440
Um...

1721
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:49,860
Save and continue.

1722
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,420
Okay, save.

1723
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,980
Let's see how it is now.

1724
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:00,800
Oh!

1725
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,540
Oh my god!

1726
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:01,740
No!

1727
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,140
I took your sword!

1728
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:03,380
Oh!

1729
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:06,880
Ow!

1730
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:13,410
What's the point of dual wielding if you're not fast enough?

1731
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:13,590
Oh!

1732
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,090
There it is.

1733
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,570
There it is.

1734
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,110
Oh my god!

1735
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,330
What the hell is that?

1736
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,810
Oh

1737
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:21,880
my god!

1738
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,960
Push, push, push!

1739
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:28,970
Am

1740
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:40,730
I okay?

1741
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:41,610
Is my health okay?

1742
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,230
Alright, we're alright.

1743
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,210
Patent on the sanity system in fact expired.

1744
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:49,470
I didn't realize it expired, right?

1745
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,190
So awesome.

1746
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,400
Oh, what's happening?

1747
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,600
Oh my god, Grandpa!

1748
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,040
There are times when insanity takes hold.

1749
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,020
And nothing seems right.

1750
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,640
During those times, I will help you.

1751
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,120
Grandpa!

1752
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,940
Am I insane?

1753
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,440
For I will keep the darkness away.

1754
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:19,980
Grandpa!

1755
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,800
Grandpa, I'm reading!

1756
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,140
This isn't really happening.

1757
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,120
Is it?

1758
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,420
Oh shoot.

1759
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,200
Oh my insanity.

1760
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,840
Oh my insanity.

1761
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,360
Come on, get the head, get the...

1762
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:36,500
Oh!

1763
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,300
Oh my

1764
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:47,560
gosh!

1765
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,600
What the hell is... Oh my gosh!

1766
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:51,600
These things are so crazy!

1767
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:55,360
Oh my god.

1768
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,220
Okay.

1769
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,620
I just took out that guy.

1770
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,840
And now, whatever this thing is...

1771
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:03,440
Okay.

1772
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,140
It's dead.

1773
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,340
Oh my insanity is really bad!

1774
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:06,960
What happened?

1775
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,460
What happened to my insanity?

1776
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,560
I think they're called bone stealers.

1777
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,340
Do these guys, like, make me...

1778
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,440
Do these guys drain me, it seems?

1779
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,520
Another dead man.

1780
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:24,700
Who were these men whose corpses litter the dungeon?

1781
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:29,260
Unwary soldiers who stumbled inside, or grave robbers looking to plunder it?

1782
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:32,180
A crumpled scroll lies under the dead man's curled fingers.

1783
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,380
Recover?

1784
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,500
Green guys drain sanity.

1785
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:38,840
Ah!

1786
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,260
What did I just get?

1787
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,200
What did I just get?

1788
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,100
What did I just get?

1789
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,280
The map's looking a little sussy.

1790
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,140
New spell.

1791
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:49,800
Wait.

1792
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:50,380
Spell list.

1793
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:51,860
Check.

1794
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,100
A tattered scroll from an ancient text.

1795
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,200
It reads The spell enables the transfer of magical power from the environment to the self.

1796
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,100
Restoration of the body, spirit, and mind is in its purpose.

1797
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,900
Noracath and Santoc.

1798
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,180
Noratoc.

1799
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,240
Oh, I don't have... I don't have those.

1800
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,080
No!

1801
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:30,850
This game...

1802
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:32,330
Oh my god!

1803
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:32,870
That's me!

1804
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:33,850
Oh!

1805
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:34,330
Shoot!

1806
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,650
Oh, there's a lot of guys here.

1807
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:37,510
Let's take them out one by one!

1808
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,820
Finish him!

1809
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,120
Ksha!

1810
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,100
Ksha!

1811
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,200
Turn the game console off now, Raiden!

1812
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,000
Oh!

1813
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,000
Oh!

1814
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,960
Wait, so if I touch this...

1815
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:03,620
Touch.

1816
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:04,700
Touch.

1817
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:05,820
Touch.

1818
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,180
It worked before!

1819
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:10,980
You picked green at the start of the game.

1820
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,660
You fight more insanity-draining monsters in this playthrough.

1821
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:14,180
Oh!

1822
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,400
Wait, that's...

1823
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,820
I actually prefer that because I like to see the sanity effects, I'm not gonna lie.

1824
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,220
But if my sanity gets too low, it says I start to drain health too, right?

1825
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,410
Wait, I can't even save in here!

1826
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:49,730
Oh my gosh!

1827
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:52,570
I didn't even notice this!

1828
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,470
Stinky!

1829
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,110
Uh-oh.

1830
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:57,410
Uh...

1831
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:58,170
No,

1832
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,040
I need to go to purple.

1833
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:04,640
Purple!

1834
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,240
Oh, purple!

1835
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,380
No, not red.

1836
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:08,880
Uh, purple!

1837
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,320
My insanity!

1838
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:19,340
Uh

1839
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:22,930
-oh.

1840
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:23,670
Finish him?

1841
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,930
Oh no, stop.

1842
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:28,810
Are you kidding me?

1843
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,090
Raiden, get out of here!

1844
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:33,710
Uh-oh.

1845
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,910
I just tried to save the game.

1846
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,930
Now it'll let me.

1847
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:39,290
Okay.

1848
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,530
Um, this isn't great, but, uh, cool!

1849
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,490
You're doing just fine.

1850
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:49,790
Hehehehe.

1851
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:57,530
He freezes me!

1852
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:57,910
Ow!

1853
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:02,730
Get him, get him, get him, get him!

1854
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,850
Get him, get him, get him!

1855
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,130
Oh

1856
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,180
gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

1857
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,120
This thing.

1858
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:22,720
Use?

1859
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:25,940
Hahaha!

1860
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,960
What just happened?

1861
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:29,920
Oh!

1862
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:30,820
It was a...

1863
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,140
Wait!

1864
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,860
No, I was supposed to heal!

1865
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,280
Oh gosh, I'm so done.

1866
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,840
I'm so dead, I'm so dead.

1867
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,280
I'm so dead, I'm so dead!

1868
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,500
Run, run, run!

1869
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,180
Get out of here!

1870
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:42,760
Get out of here!

1871
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:44,940
Open the door!

1872
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,400
Open

1873
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,150
the door!

1874
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,300
Oh my gosh.

1875
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,700
I thought that actually happened.

1876
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,040
Oh, okay.

1877
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,260
No, I think I'm gonna have to do it from here.

1878
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:05,520
Okay.

1879
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,920
Still missing an arm.

1880
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,880
I can get this.

1881
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,380
Get his arm, get his arm, get his arm, come on!

1882
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,300
Oh my gosh, please.

1883
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,500
It's so hard to aim.

1884
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,920
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, please!

1885
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,720
Get the... I'm trying to aim for the arm.

1886
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:22,840
Oh my gosh.

1887
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,700
Oh, it's happening.

1888
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,120
Please, just find him!

1889
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:28,940
Just find him!

1890
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,080
Oh gosh, I'm gonna die again.

1891
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,140
This is it, this is it for...

1892
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,420
This is it for Kareem!

1893
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:36,880
Just kidding!

1894
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:37,720
Get out of here!

1895
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,080
Oh, there we go.

1896
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,580
Get behind him, okay.

1897
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,400
I'm gonna use all my health in this one fight.

1898
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,500
If I have to reload, I will.

1899
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:54,580
But...

1900
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,060
Now, um...

1901
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,060
Embarrassing.

1902
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,560
Finish it, please!

1903
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,960
I need the insanity!

1904
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:22,490
Magical Codex!

1905
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:25,690
Holy cow.

1906
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:29,390
I'm gonna save, but like in this slot.

1907
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:31,490
Just in case.

1908
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:35,910
Since we have very few health left.

1909
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:37,570
Um...

1910
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,550
New spell.

1911
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,170
Wait.

1912
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,550
Spell list.

1913
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:44,770
What do I have?

1914
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:45,990
What are my runes?

1915
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:50,650
We need...

1916
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,510
Narakoth and Santok.

1917
01:28:58,830 --> 01:28:59,810
This one, probably?

1918
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:03,550
Woohoo!

1919
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:07,210
Oh, my sword!

1920
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:07,670
You're right!

1921
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:08,510
We shouldn't...

1922
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:12,670
Spell

1923
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:17,030
the...

1924
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,790
Um...

1925
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,810
Hello?

1926
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:20,670
Uh...

1927
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,710
Spell list.

1928
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:23,770
Oh, there we go.

1929
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:24,210
Assign.

1930
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,610
Recover.

1931
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:28,270
There we go.

1932
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,650
Enchant item, recover.

1933
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,510
Yes, we should totally, um...

1934
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:34,630
Oh, wait.

1935
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:34,870
Hold on.

1936
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:35,970
We'll do this.

1937
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:38,510
We'll enchant our sword.

1938
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:42,330
Oh, my sword.

1939
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,290
Yippee!

1940
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,570
And then we'll...

1941
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,030
Recover?

1942
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:51,610
Oh, shoot.

1943
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:53,030
I have no magical energy.

1944
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:56,630
Yay!

1945
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:02,530
Oh...

1946
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:04,670
Yeah, I gotta keep moving.

1947
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,050
That's right!

1948
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,390
Wait, open the door?

1949
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,270
Oh, okay.

1950
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,930
Wait, huge?

1951
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,330
Am I huge?

1952
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,100
Am I humongous?

1953
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:20,800
Or is it just me?

1954
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:42,650
The sanity effects are so funny because some...

1955
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,750
Oh, but look at that.

1956
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:44,670
It still went away.

1957
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:47,010
Even though it, like, reset the...

1958
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:47,650
room.

1959
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:49,890
Can I recover now?

1960
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,070
Then call Santa.

1961
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:52,150
Give me all.

1962
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,330
Ooh!

1963
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:00,010
Let's do it again.

1964
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,910
Then call Santa.

1965
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,010
Give me all.

1966
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,490
Wait!

1967
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:07,630
I'm not recovering health?

1968
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:09,290
Oh.

1969
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,830
That's a little silly.

1970
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:13,170
There's also a room in here.

1971
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:16,630
It does literally nothing.

1972
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:21,030
Metallic plaque replaces the lock.

1973
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,710
A colored sigil is engraved on the metal above the wide slot.

1974
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:26,130
The slot appears to be wide enough to insert a large blade.

1975
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:28,110
The slot appears to be wide enough to insert a large blade.

1976
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:29,010
Don't I know that one, though?

1977
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,840
Recovering mana with mana.

1978
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:36,260
Recovering mana with mana.

1979
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,480
What is this?

1980
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,880
I thought I was recovering health at least.

1981
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:45,930
What did I...

1982
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,650
Oh, I think I'm talking to myself again.

1983
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:50,490
Stone tablet!

1984
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:51,170
Stone tablet!

1985
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,240
The aged ceiling has collapsed, creating an impassable pile of rubble that blocks the doorway.

1986
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,100
The aged ceiling has collapsed, creating an impassable pile of rubble that blocks the doorway.

1987
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,860
I don't think I have a lot of runes.

1988
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,280
Wakan with a purpose.

1989
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,160
He's like, I'm here to get my girl!

1990
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,400
Oh!

1991
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,140
The Dutch angle is...

1992
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,320
He's doing what the gay.

1993
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:35,830
Cinematic.

1994
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:37,970
Of course.

1995
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:43,270
I guess I'll grab that and regret it afterwards.

1996
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,070
Sorry, I'm save scumming now.

1997
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,500
That's me!

1998
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:08,200
Karim!

1999
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,800
It's got an eyeball on it and everything.

2000
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,640
That's quite a few guys we got here.

2001
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,340
Check it.

2002
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:31,440
A formidable weapon that enables the user to strike many enemies at once and still keep a distance.

2003
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:37,000
With a sweep, Karim can knock down enemies and can cause extreme damage with an overhead attack.

2004
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,160
Let's go.

2005
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,300
Oh gosh.

2006
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,360
Run, Karim.

2007
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,080
I don't know where to walk.

2008
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,320
Finish him!

2009
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:05,360
Nice.

2010
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,660
Oh gosh.

2011
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,320
Ouchie ouchie.

2012
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,080
Finish him!

2013
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,780
So much sanity.

2014
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:13,360
Yummy sanity!

2015
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,720
Sanity, sanity!

2016
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:21,460
Oh no, my sanity!

2017
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,080
Wow, that was so easy.

2018
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,160
Holy cow!

2019
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,200
Guts mode?

2020
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:26,860
Oh.

2021
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,520
Again, again!

2022
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:29,600
Hahaha!

2023
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,900
Again, again!

2024
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,020
Hahaha!

2025
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,460
Again, again!

2026
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,220
They're draining my sanity like crazy though.

2027
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,100
Even the sanity that I get back is drained.

2028
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:00,820
I'll drain...

2029
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,760
Oh no!

2030
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,800
All the sanity I get back is drained.

2031
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,180
Hahaha!

2032
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,300
Again, again!

2033
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,120
Hahaha!

2034
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,860
No, stop draining my sanity, please!

2035
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,060
I need it!

2036
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,640
The music just stops.

2037
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:53,020
Let me spot you some sanity.

2038
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:53,800
Thank you!

2039
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,180
Is that it?

2040
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,400
Oh my gosh.

2041
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:58,820
More?

2042
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,600
Oh, this guy's got a rune!

2043
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:04,840
Oh my gosh.

2044
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,810
Stop taking my sanity!

2045
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:13,290
Oh, it's a big guy.

2046
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,050
I forgot that I can...

2047
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:21,230
Yeah!

2048
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:25,760
Wait, my health!

2049
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:27,880
Ah!

2050
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,520
Oh, it's this thing.

2051
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,100
Oh my god.

2052
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2053
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,480
Please.

2054
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:33,040
Oh my god, no!

2055
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,160
Oh my god!

2056
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:36,940
Hit it!

2057
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,020
Please!

2058
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:38,620
Oh gosh!

2059
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:39,680
Kareem!

2060
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:40,780
Kareem!

2061
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,970
Oh, I hate these skinwalker things.

2062
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:47,890
They're so gross!

2063
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:49,570
Oh my god, please!

2064
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:50,330
Oh my gosh!

2065
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,570
Oh, I'm not gonna make it!

2066
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:52,950
I'm not gonna make it!

2067
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:53,630
No, please!

2068
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:54,650
Kareem!

2069
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:55,670
Kareem!

2070
01:36:59,020 --> 01:36:59,960
I'm not gonna make it!

2071
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,120
Oh, I'm not gonna make it!

2072
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:01,760
I'm not gonna make it!

2073
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,340
I'm not gonna make it!

2074
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,580
I can barely run!

2075
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,300
I can barely run!

2076
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:05,740
Oh!

2077
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,580
This thing is faster than me!

2078
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,340
Please!

2079
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,120
Please, just die!

2080
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:10,700
Oh god.

2081
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,380
I can't...

2082
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,080
I can't hit it!

2083
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,780
I can't hit it!

2084
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,040
Oh, please!

2085
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:15,920
It's too...

2086
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,480
It's too squiggly!

2087
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:18,520
It's too squiggly!

2088
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:21,100
Oh...

2089
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,680
Oh, gosh!

2090
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,720
Oh, it's dead, but...

2091
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,900
So am I!

2092
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,000
Aim!

2093
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:29,940
No, it's...

2094
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,820
It's literally...

2095
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,680
I think it's literally because it's like...

2096
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,040
How do I describe it?

2097
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,880
It's like...

2098
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,320
It's like...

2099
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,680
I think I can't get too close to it, you know?

2100
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,020
I don't know.

2101
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:43,580
I can't...

2102
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,320
I aim for it, but it's just...

2103
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,020
Oh, my gosh.

2104
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:46,380
It went away.

2105
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,580
One HP in a dream, baby.

2106
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,260
Kareem has perished at the hands of the eternal darkness.

2107
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,820
With no one to stop their diabolical plans, humanity will surely be annihilated.

2108
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,780
The end!

2109
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,140
Of course, the little...

2110
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,160
Stupid stick man comes out!

2111
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:27,620
Oh, my gosh!

2112
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,300
Oh, it's so frustrating.

2113
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:39,980
It's okay.

2114
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,100
We saved right before it.

2115
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:47,310
Ah!

2116
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,590
The darkness comes!

2117
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,770
The darkness comes!

2118
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:54,990
Oh, Kareem!

2119
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:59,250
Chakrams...

2120
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,770
Oh, for those things?

2121
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:01,130
Okay.

2122
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,310
Here we go.

2123
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:09,690
Oh, no!

2124
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:09,790
Oh, no!

2125
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:09,870
Oh, no!

2126
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:09,910
Oh, no!

2127
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:10,030
Let's go!

2128
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,980
I want to enchant it, but I don't think I can.

2129
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,920
I think they'll get me first.

2130
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,360
Oh, shoot.

2131
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:27,960
Oh, shoot.

2132
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:28,360
Oh, shoot.

2133
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:28,680
Oh, shoot.

2134
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:28,860
Oh, shoot.

2135
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:28,880
Oh, shoot.

2136
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:29,880
Where am I?

2137
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,400
Oh, God!

2138
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,600
I can't see where I am, you guys!

2139
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,280
Ah!

2140
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:42,590
Close.

2141
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:43,790
Not far enough, I guess.

2142
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:44,090
Where?

2143
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:45,230
Um...

2144
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:46,750
Oh, my God!

2145
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:47,050
Please!

2146
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:47,650
Ah!

2147
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:50,250
Take him out!

2148
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,310
Oh my god.

2149
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,070
Kareem?

2150
01:39:56,770 --> 01:39:58,250
Kareem, we were doing so well before.

2151
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:58,750
What happened?

2152
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:00,650
Kareem, you're losing...

2153
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:03,110
You're losing your edge, buddy.

2154
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:04,910
Oh my god.

2155
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:08,690
You only got

2156
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,130
the one guy.

2157
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:15,830
Are they infighting?

2158
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:16,250
No.

2159
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:17,830
Come on!

2160
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:18,630
Take him out!

2161
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,350
Go.

2162
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:25,660
Finish him.

2163
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,040
Okay.

2164
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:27,580
Here we go.

2165
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:28,780
Okay, Kareem.

2166
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,900
We're okay, Kareem.

2167
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,420
We got this.

2168
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,560
Come on, Kareem.

2169
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,980
Even if it's just one more...

2170
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,300
We got this.

2171
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,360
Finish him.

2172
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:36,720
Finish him.

2173
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,100
Finish him.

2174
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:37,820
Finish him.

2175
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:40,720
Okay.

2176
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,280
Heal now?

2177
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,080
That's a good idea.

2178
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,200
Oh, that gave us a lot.

2179
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:50,440
Nice.

2180
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,180
He's right next to me!

2181
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,060
He's right behind me.

2182
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,160
Isn't he?

2183
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,100
Oh my god.

2184
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:07,940
Holy cow.

2185
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:10,860
Yeah!

2186
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,380
Now we're gaming, Kareem!

2187
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,640
Now we're gaming, Kareem!

2188
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,420
I'm trying to finish him, but...

2189
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,480
I'm trying.

2190
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,100
There we go.

2191
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,840
Hopefully that counted.

2192
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:27,100
Finish him!

2193
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,060
This guy over here, headless.

2194
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,180
Unable to...

2195
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,160
He's so unsure.

2196
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,000
You okay, buddy?

2197
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,660
They don't even count him as an enemy.

2198
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:39,040
The music stopped.

2199
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:39,900
Oh, just kidding.

2200
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,880
Get up!

2201
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,060
You still got some fight in you!

2202
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:45,820
Oh,

2203
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:56,420
enchant!

2204
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:56,920
You're right.

2205
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:59,100
Oh, I did the wrong thing.

2206
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:02,920
There we go.

2207
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,900
Okay, enchant this.

2208
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,500
There we go.

2209
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:09,860
I wonder if it still worked.

2210
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:13,580
Yeah!

2211
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,740
Wait, are these the guys?

2212
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,080
No, not yet.

2213
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:24,540
Can

2214
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,340
I finish this guy here?

2215
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:52,580
Finish him?

2216
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:06,510
These gangles are so bad for measuring distance.

2217
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:08,170
It's really... It is tough.

2218
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:09,970
Oh, you're still up!

2219
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:12,390
You did it!

2220
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,950
Overhead all these fools.

2221
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:27,830
Yeah, baby!

2222
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:29,830
Yeah, baby!

2223
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,170
All right.

2224
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:35,270
Maybe I should take him out first.

2225
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,990
Because...

2226
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,570
The other guys...

2227
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:44,370
They transform.

2228
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:46,950
And I don't want to deal with them.

2229
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:49,890
Where did he go?

2230
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:50,590
Hello?

2231
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,250
Are you still over here?

2232
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:53,290
Are you still lying down?

2233
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:54,490
Where did you go?

2234
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:55,710
Oh, there he is.

2235
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:56,470
He was lying down.

2236
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,210
No way.

2237
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,260
Can I leave?

2238
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,160
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

2239
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:21,960
Okay.

2240
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,920
I haven't used this new thing.

2241
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,460
So, I'm nervous about it.

2242
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,600
Rip and tear, man.

2243
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,280
Rip and tear.

2244
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:34,270
I'm nervous.

2245
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:34,770
I'm nervous.

2246
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,290
Check the spells.

2247
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:40,830
New spells.

2248
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:44,710
Self.

2249
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:49,330
Is that it?

2250
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:00,680
Recover.

2251
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,260
Now does it...

2252
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:05,500
Wait.

2253
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,820
But it's not in the thing.

2254
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:14,070
Recover green flavor.

2255
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,750
Yeah.

2256
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,390
But like...

2257
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:17,530
I have to do it afterwards.

2258
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:18,210
I think.

2259
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:18,590
I don't...

2260
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:20,290
Unless I can do it over here.

2261
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:23,850
No.

2262
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:25,710
I just recovered more mana.

2263
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,250
Hey.

2264
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,370
Why didn't it work though?

2265
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,260
Okay.

2266
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,440
Now...

2267
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,520
Wrong alignment?

2268
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,480
Oh.

2269
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,240
It didn't assign it.

2270
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,380
But it's also not in here.

2271
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:44,220
Okay.

2272
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:44,960
Let's try this.

2273
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,360
It's not under my...

2274
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,240
Assign.

2275
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:48,180
Oh!

2276
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,040
I see.

2277
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:49,760
I see.

2278
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,540
I see how it works.

2279
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:50,800
I see.

2280
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,040
I see.

2281
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:51,420
I see.

2282
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,340
Okay.

2283
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:53,040
Okay.

2284
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:53,220
Okay.

2285
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:53,980
That makes more sense.

2286
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,000
Okay.

2287
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,860
Maybe actually I should assign it to Y.

2288
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:05,630
Paragon.

2289
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:06,070
Paragon.

2290
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:06,450
Par...

2291
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:07,570
Are we paragoning?

2292
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,030
Okay.

2293
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:13,090
This thing, right?

2294
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:13,890
The chakram.

2295
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,210
I'm scared to use it.

2296
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:16,430
I'm scared to use it.

2297
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:20,870
Unless... do you think the torch will work too?

2298
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:27,850
Oh

2299
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,240
my gosh.

2300
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,040
Don't just stand there, I guess.

2301
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,100
No, it does not.

2302
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:41,840
Great.

2303
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:42,680
Good to know.

2304
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:43,540
Awesome.

2305
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:46,520
Why did I allow both of them to come out at once?

2306
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,040
Oh my god.

2307
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:48,640
Oh my god.

2308
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:48,980
Oh my god.

2309
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,320
Oh my god.

2310
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:49,620
Oh my god.

2311
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:49,940
Oh my god.

2312
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,220
Oh my god.

2313
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,840
Oh my god.

2314
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,580
Oh no, no, no.

2315
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,100
Okay, here we go.

2316
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:54,940
Here goes nothing!

2317
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,720
Please don't die.

2318
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,000
Oh my god.

2319
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:47,500
Please.

2320
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,280
Please.

2321
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:50,580
Please, I can't tell where this thing is!

2322
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,580
Oh, I got it.

2323
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:01,510
Oh my god, please.

2324
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:02,470
I'm gonna die.

2325
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:02,950
I'm gonna die.

2326
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:07,350
Oh, so close!

2327
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:07,430
So close!

2328
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,550
So close!

2329
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:09,490
Oh, thank god.

2330
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:14,810
Well, my health is...

2331
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:17,270
Not great.

2332
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,510
Here we go.

2333
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:33,110
I lived somehow.

2334
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:37,690
But not very...

2335
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:39,970
Okay, I'm gonna move on.

2336
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:48,690
My heartbeat.

2337
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,830
A win's a win.

2338
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,890
Yeah, but like...

2339
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:55,010
If I can't make it out...

2340
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,130
If I can't make it out...

2341
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:00,150
If I have to go through it again...

2342
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:03,770
I shouldn't... I shouldn't have... I don't know why I let both of them come out at once.

2343
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:06,370
That was... That was me just not thinking.

2344
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:07,650
But, you know...

2345
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,350
I'm slow...

2346
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:14,670
I'm steady...

2347
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:16,890
Save?

2348
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:18,130
Yeah, you're right.

2349
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:19,290
Well...

2350
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:21,630
I'll save in this one.

2351
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:22,890
Because...

2352
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:24,930
If I feel like I can't...

2353
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:28,150
Continue...

2354
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:30,370
Because my sanity is way too low...

2355
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:31,910
Then it would be bad.

2356
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,320
Or not sanity...

2357
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,760
You know, my health is what I meant.

2358
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:39,840
Where did I...

2359
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,440
Oh, this way, right?

2360
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,120
Yeah...

2361
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,360
There was that door we need to open.

2362
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:49,920
Okay...

2363
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,200
We were hobbling along.

2364
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:54,460
Um...

2365
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,120
I thought maybe if I cast it in front of the door...

2366
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,040
It would work.

2367
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:06,120
Hello?

2368
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,460
Oh, there we go.

2369
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:20,580
Karim places the blade in the slot, but feels it push back.

2370
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:24,380
It is as if the magic of the blade does not fit the lock...

2371
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:25,540
Oh...

2372
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,500
Okay, we need to...

2373
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,560
We need to make it green.

2374
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,180
New spell, baby.

2375
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:35,620
Um...

2376
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,080
Item...

2377
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,420
What was the other one?

2378
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,040
There we go.

2379
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,500
Item spell.

2380
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:49,880
I love item spell.

2381
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,660
Uh...

2382
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,620
Cast item spell green upon the sword.

2383
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,860
That's how we open it.

2384
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:06,480
Oh...

2385
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:09,740
Oh, wait.

2386
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,540
I forgot to...

2387
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:12,640
Fuse.

2388
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,060
Green apple flavor.

2389
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:18,680
Is this a door over here?

2390
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,840
Kind of looks like it would be one.

2391
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,740
Oh, my gosh.

2392
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,240
My health.

2393
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,020
Karim, you're worrying me, buddy.

2394
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:29,620
Oh, gosh.

2395
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:30,320
Oh, gosh.

2396
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,120
I got you.

2397
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,480
Oh, gosh.

2398
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,420
Ah, don't finish him!

2399
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:38,980
Wait.

2400
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:39,580
Karim...

2401
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,270
Ha.

2402
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:50,710
Whew!

2403
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:52,110
Yeah, we are so sane.

2404
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,790
Um, I think we're...

2405
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:56,870
I'm like...

2406
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:59,750
I am so aware of the world right now.

2407
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:01,850
I am so sane.

2408
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:03,290
I'm...

2409
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:08,250
I am... I am... Maybe I'm not as sane as I thought.

2410
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,430
I've taken my moods!

2411
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:12,390
I've taken my moods!

2412
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:13,390
I've taken my moods!

2413
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:15,050
I know that there's a ladder right there.

2414
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:15,990
I'm just seeing if there's anything.

2415
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:18,570
I wish this game had, like, health.

2416
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:23,430
Here we go!

2417
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,860
I thought they weren't able to hear.

2418
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,040
You can take my sanity.

2419
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,560
It's fine.

2420
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,480
It's fine if you take my sanity.

2421
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,100
I don't need it.

2422
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:51,940
I'm good.

2423
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,620
Any chakrams left?

2424
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:54,020
No.

2425
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,800
I'm so sane I'm seeing the player through the screen.

2426
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,460
What is that?

2427
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,480
What's that action figure?

2428
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:09,840
A ruby effigy stands upon the pedestal centered in the room.

2429
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,360
It's mine now!

2430
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,340
What do I do with this?

2431
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:22,320
A small statuette of a defeated warrior.

2432
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:23,000
That's me!

2433
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,820
Kneeling in respect to an unseen victor.

2434
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,740
It is made from a deep red ruby.

2435
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:31,860
Okay.

2436
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,380
Is it Anthony?

2437
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:36,460
Oh no.

2438
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:37,000
No, no, no, no.

2439
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,460
Go ahead.

2440
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,240
Take my sanity.

2441
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,720
Whatever.

2442
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:46,620
Just don't trap me, please.

2443
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,580
Do I leave?

2444
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,960
Is there anything else in here?

2445
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:54,460
I guess I leave.

2446
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,740
Another simp just like me?

2447
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:01,660
Okay.

2448
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:05,140
Trappers can sometimes be helpful.

2449
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:13,660
If I go into the shadow realm, does sometimes there's health?

2450
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,420
You know how there was like a magic restore thing?

2451
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,700
Is there sometimes a health restore?

2452
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:22,500
I'm a little... I'm afraid Little Caesar's crazy bread is currently just regular bread to you.

2453
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:26,180
Oh yes?

2454
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,240
Should I go then?

2455
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:38,840
Oh my god.

2456
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:49,250
There's not that many guys here either.

2457
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:50,170
So red?

2458
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,250
Maybe?

2459
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,510
I can't see what's over here.

2460
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:56,210
Makes me a little nervous.

2461
01:54:58,670 --> 01:54:59,590
Go to red.

2462
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:01,830
Wait, was that a guy?

2463
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:03,710
Yes, it is.

2464
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:09,340
Hello.

2465
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:10,140
Hello, sir.

2466
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,040
Can you see me?

2467
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:15,780
Oh.

2468
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:20,820
Oh.

2469
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,260
Shoot.

2470
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:21,780
Oh.

2471
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,360
Oh.

2472
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,400
I think I got him.

2473
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:28,080
Oh, yeah baby!

2474
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,980
Oh my gosh!

2475
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,520
It worked!

2476
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,980
Wait, what is purple?

2477
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:34,900
Oh, purple is to leave.

2478
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,040
Oh my gosh!

2479
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:38,200
Okay, so this is how the trappers work.

2480
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:40,580
Interesting.

2481
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:43,420
And now we're like basically...

2482
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,240
We're basically Gucci.

2483
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,180
We're so good.

2484
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:48,880
Nice!

2485
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,160
I'm so healthy!

2486
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:56,500
I'm so healthy!

2487
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,080
Oh, are you still alive?

2488
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:02,120
How?

2489
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,760
How are you still standing?

2490
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,900
He's like, I'm still standing.

2491
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:18,200
Oh, that was great!

2492
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:18,700
Okay.

2493
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,400
Oh.

2494
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,320
I'm so healthy, maid who's already dead.

2495
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,000
Kareem is healthy.

2496
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,720
These are kind of cute.

2497
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,260
Here I go in slow motion.

2498
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,060
Trapper.

2499
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:46,720
I hardly know her.

2500
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:52,230
I hope you're not.

2501
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:53,970
Okay.

2502
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:56,770
Walk.

2503
01:56:57,730 --> 01:56:58,330
Yippee!

2504
01:56:58,330 --> 01:56:59,490
Oh, Kareem!

2505
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,590
I'm so happy for you!

2506
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:02,090
Now...

2507
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,430
Now what?

2508
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:07,630
We have this little... We have our figurine.

2509
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:10,590
What do we do with them?

2510
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:13,890
Oh, save?

2511
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:15,730
That's such a great idea.

2512
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:19,030
You guys are so right.

2513
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,990
In fact, I'm gonna go over the first one.

2514
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,070
Since we're so back, baby.

2515
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:30,210
Since we are so back, baby!

2516
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:40,830
Where do I go from here?

2517
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:45,370
Hold on, I'm checking the map.

2518
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,780
Control pad...

2519
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:56,900
Oh, C stick.

2520
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:57,760
Oh, here we go.

2521
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,720
We are so back, baby!

2522
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:04,520
I think you can continue down the hallway?

2523
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:05,760
This one?

2524
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:07,680
Oh.

2525
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,220
This one.

2526
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:10,220
This is the second one.

2527
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:12,500
I don't think so.

2528
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:13,740
I'll check again though.

2529
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:14,420
Doesn't hurt.

2530
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,060
Oh.

2531
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:25,040
Along the length of the corridor, the ceiling has given way and collapsed, littering the floor with debris.

2532
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:26,680
Oh!

2533
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:27,160
Climb!

2534
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:28,420
Ah!

2535
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:37,890
What's there?

2536
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:41,570
Oh!

2537
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:42,270
It's this guy!

2538
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,090
Oh my god!

2539
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:43,550
Oh my god!

2540
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:43,750
No!

2541
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:45,270
You're just a normal enemy now!

2542
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:47,250
That's messed up!

2543
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:48,370
That's messed up!

2544
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:52,210
That's messed up!

2545
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:55,110
Oh shoot.

2546
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:56,850
Come on!

2547
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:58,590
I'm trying to get your... I'm trying to get your arm!

2548
01:58:59,450 --> 01:59:00,110
Oh my god.

2549
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:03,330
Oh my gosh.

2550
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:04,830
My... my...

2551
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:07,670
He's taking out my magic!

2552
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:09,770
Oh my god!

2553
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:14,570
Whoa!

2554
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,730
That's a big ol' boost.

2555
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:19,810
Magic is fine though.

2556
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:20,650
We just can recover.

2557
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,410
This is why we save.

2558
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:28,740
Yeah, we'll just run around.

2559
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:29,620
We're good.

2560
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,180
But my health is already halfway.

2561
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,300
That's insane!

2562
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,460
Blue weak to green.

2563
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,460
Wait, so because I chose...

2564
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:47,120
Because I chose green at the beginning, I'm basically like a grass type.

2565
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,380
And so that's why I can kill him quickly?

2566
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:57,480
Or... wait... do I...

2567
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:03,590
You need the green encha... yeah!

2568
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:06,330
If I enchant it because it was blue when I enchanted it blue.

2569
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,490
And then green...

2570
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:12,570
This game is so much more complex than I thought it was... like...

2571
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:13,790
In a good way, you know?

2572
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:14,190
Like...

2573
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:16,490
There's so much more to this game than I...

2574
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,980
And because I see... mostly...

2575
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,500
Wait, what was my... hold on.

2576
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:36,660
Because I see mostly... green guys, I should keep my weapon blue.

2577
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,940
I decided to play this again since you started it.

2578
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:43,700
I ended up dying twice in a later chapter where you have a shotgun because I was impatient and rushing with traps.

2579
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:44,640
Always be patient.

2580
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,360
Thank you for the reminder.

2581
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,000
Oh wait!

2582
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:52,420
Red!

2583
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,760
Okay, red beats green.

2584
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:54,460
Okay, okay, okay.

2585
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,000
Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.

2586
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:57,760
Oh!

2587
02:00:58,760 --> 02:00:59,920
What a peculiar room.

2588
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:01,880
What the hell is this?

2589
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,580
A blasphemous sculpture made from human skin and bone.

2590
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:12,660
A trestle of bones is cradled within this shrine like a nightmarish book stand beckoning to be used.

2591
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:15,400
I have a thing to put it there.

2592
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,380
There you go!

2593
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,420
Oh, I got it back?

2594
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:32,000
Nice.

2595
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:39,140
This looks really ominous, so...

2596
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:44,060
This looks quite ominous.

2597
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,580
This looks quite scary.

2598
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,520
Is this like a final boss?

2599
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:56,330
This game is Lovecraft Pokemon.

2600
02:01:59,360 --> 02:01:59,750
Oh!

2601
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,290
Woah, what's happening?

2602
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:02,190
Woah.

2603
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:08,970
It's draining my sanity as we speak!

2604
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:17,260
Finish him!

2605
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:20,480
Finish him!

2606
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,740
Finish him!

2607
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:25,660
Oh!

2608
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,300
There's more coming.

2609
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,820
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2610
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:30,780
Wait!

2611
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,500
Oh, is this the same room again?

2612
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,400
Wait a second.

2613
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:37,600
Ow!

2614
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:39,760
Oh!

2615
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:40,500
Oh my god!

2616
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:42,080
Oh, the girls are fighting!

2617
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:43,680
Oh.

2618
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,280
There we go.

2619
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,080
Finish him!

2620
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:52,020
Finish him!

2621
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:54,000
Oh, wrong guy.

2622
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:54,860
It's okay.

2623
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:56,400
Finish him!

2624
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:03,760
Oh, woah.

2625
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:04,940
My sanity though.

2626
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:05,700
My sanity.

2627
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:14,120
I like how the music stops.

2628
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:15,820
I'm like, oh, this part's over?

2629
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:16,940
Or...

2630
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,560
Nope, not over.

2631
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,060
Just, you know...

2632
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:23,680
Just being a little goofy silly.

2633
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,120
Finish him!

2634
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,220
Oh my gosh.

2635
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:26,900
Run away!

2636
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:27,300
Run away!

2637
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:32,480
Run away!

2638
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,560
Run away!

2639
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,100
Oh!

2640
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

2641
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

2642
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:41,370
Oh, gosh.

2643
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:44,570
Finish him!

2644
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:45,590
Finish him!

2645
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:46,290
Oh, shoot.

2646
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:46,550
Okay.

2647
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:46,970
Just kidding.

2648
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:52,150
Are you gonna also explode into a Skinwalker?

2649
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:54,130
Oh my gosh.

2650
02:03:54,150 --> 02:03:54,690
This guy again.

2651
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:02,890
I wish I had health.

2652
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:03,890
Uh...

2653
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:06,870
Oh, gosh.

2654
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,770
This guy's not dead!

2655
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:07,870
Oh, no!

2656
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:11,350
Oh my gosh.

2657
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,910
I can't...

2658
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,940
He took me out!

2659
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,640
He took me out so fast.

2660
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:30,700
Yo, what?

2661
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:33,740
Oh my gosh.

2662
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:35,640
He took me out so fast!

2663
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:38,600
Wow.

2664
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:40,560
Um...

2665
02:04:44,410 --> 02:04:48,390
If only you had read the game manual before playing, you would know the strats.

2666
02:04:50,190 --> 02:04:52,410
Wait, I can't tell if you're being serious or not.

2667
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,890
I can't tell if you're being serious or not.

2668
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:02,610
I saved a...

2669
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:03,730
Oh, this one.

2670
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:03,910
Okay.

2671
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:11,830
Yeah, if only you had read the actual game manual.

2672
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:12,250
Gosh.

2673
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:14,650
Everybody does that nowadays.

2674
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,650
I hope it's a joke.

2675
02:05:21,790 --> 02:05:22,310
Okay.

2676
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:22,390
Okay.

2677
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:22,890
Here we go.

2678
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:31,110
I can't tell what this border does.

2679
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,010
Oh, wait.

2680
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:34,150
I take out these guys.

2681
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:36,050
Finish

2682
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:43,720
him.

2683
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:46,980
Eternal Dwarf.

2684
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,460
Shut up.

2685
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,420
What is this?

2686
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,320
Why is everybody picking on me?

2687
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:57,260
Oh.

2688
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,000
And

2689
02:06:05,030 --> 02:06:05,710
then these guys.

2690
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:07,730
Oh.

2691
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:08,710
My bad.

2692
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:09,570
Okay.

2693
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:10,890
Okay.

2694
02:06:10,910 --> 02:06:11,610
Finish him.

2695
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,570
Finish him.

2696
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:14,210
Finish him.

2697
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:15,410
Be fast about it.

2698
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:16,810
Be quick about it.

2699
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:20,730
Finish him.

2700
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:21,590
Finish him.

2701
02:06:24,730 --> 02:06:26,330
Going down to the...

2702
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:26,630
Yeah.

2703
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:27,790
I'm getting the strategy guide.

2704
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:30,930
If I do this...

2705
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:33,530
You are sent to Celadon.

2706
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:34,470
It didn't work.

2707
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:38,630
They say don't move during those.

2708
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:41,310
I can't tell if it had been completed or not.

2709
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:43,830
Finish him.

2710
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:45,450
Finish him.

2711
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:46,230
Finish him.

2712
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:47,830
Finish him.

2713
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:48,710
Oh, gosh.

2714
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:49,450
Why is this...

2715
02:06:49,450 --> 02:06:50,310
Why this camera angle?

2716
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:50,690
Please.

2717
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:51,350
Please.

2718
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:52,370
I can't see anything.

2719
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,040
You'll hear a sparking sound if it didn't work.

2720
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:03,440
Oh, okay.

2721
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:03,740
Okay.

2722
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:13,730
That's it.

2723
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:13,910
I'm in a bad spot.

2724
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:17,310
This area sucks.

2725
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:23,210
Oh.

2726
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:24,990
Maybe this area isn't so...

2727
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:27,510
Maybe this area is not so bad as I thought.

2728
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:30,090
Just spam it.

2729
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,130
Just spam it.

2730
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:32,290
Just spam it.

2731
02:07:34,630 --> 02:07:35,330
Finish him.

2732
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,910
Oh, no.

2733
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,110
No.

2734
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:36,310
No.

2735
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,450
No.

2736
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:36,710
No.

2737
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:36,930
No.

2738
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:37,210
No.

2739
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:37,350
No.

2740
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:37,590
No.

2741
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:38,010
No.

2742
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:38,330
No.

2743
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:42,910
No.

2744
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:44,370
Finish him.

2745
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:45,970
The cheese zone.

2746
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:46,750
Uh-oh.

2747
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:47,810
Oh, here it comes.

2748
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,430
Is this the big...

2749
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,730
Oh, no.

2750
02:07:49,890 --> 02:07:50,650
Oh, my God.

2751
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:51,490
There's still another guy.

2752
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:54,510
That I have to take out.

2753
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:55,250
Wow.

2754
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:56,510
This guy is coming after me.

2755
02:07:59,050 --> 02:07:59,450
Oh.

2756
02:07:59,590 --> 02:07:59,870
Ouch.

2757
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:00,130
Ouch.

2758
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:01,130
My san...

2759
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:01,510
Oh.

2760
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:02,610
Oh, my sanity.

2761
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:03,690
Oh, my gosh.

2762
02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:05,030
Oh, my gosh.

2763
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:08,510
You are sent to Celadon.

2764
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:13,610
Go for the eyes.

2765
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:14,970
Go for the eyes.

2766
02:08:15,350 --> 02:08:15,750
Go for the eyes.

2767
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:16,170
Come on.

2768
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:16,650
Kareem.

2769
02:08:16,650 --> 02:08:17,090
Kareem.

2770
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:17,370
Kareem.

2771
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:17,850
I need you to...

2772
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:18,830
I need you to aim, buddy.

2773
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:19,870
I need you to...

2774
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:20,270
Oh, gosh.

2775
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,670
Kareem.

2776
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:21,430
Kareem.

2777
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:22,110
Kareem.

2778
02:08:22,190 --> 02:08:22,930
Let's go behind him.

2779
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:23,490
Buddy.

2780
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:26,890
Let's go behind him and take out an arm or something.

2781
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:27,570
Okay.

2782
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:27,990
Nope.

2783
02:08:28,110 --> 02:08:28,370
Nope.

2784
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:28,730
Oh.

2785
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:32,470
Missed the reach.

2786
02:08:34,190 --> 02:08:34,630
No.

2787
02:08:36,570 --> 02:08:38,590
I keep dying to this one guy.

2788
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:39,730
No.

2789
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:39,930
No.

2790
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:40,250
No.

2791
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:41,950
Oh.

2792
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:44,800
No.

2793
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:47,520
It's so hard to see sometimes.

2794
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:49,520
The reach, though.

2795
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:51,500
It looks like I'm reaching him, but...

2796
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,500
Hmm.

2797
02:08:55,460 --> 02:08:57,000
Good for the chakrams?

2798
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,200
Okay.

2799
02:08:58,820 --> 02:08:59,300
Ah.

2800
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:02,860
It sucks that I have to keep doing the same battle over and over again, though.

2801
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:06,960
Darkness comes.

2802
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:12,000
Can't aim because he only has eyes for Chandra.

2803
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:14,780
So, yeah.

2804
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:16,400
I guess maybe enchanting gear.

2805
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:18,060
Oh.

2806
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:18,420
Oh.

2807
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:18,860
Oh.

2808
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,220
Wait.

2809
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:26,900
I just...

2810
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,520
I just realized...

2811
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,180
Never mind.

2812
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:42,160
This

2813
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,860
one makes it sharper, right?

2814
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,560
Like, it's supposed to make your weapon sharper?

2815
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,200
Or is it...

2816
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:52,800
It only works against...

2817
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,220
Oh, wait.

2818
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,520
So, it actually doesn't even help?

2819
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:56,220
Are you guys getting it out?

2820
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:56,780
Or...

2821
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:58,220
What is this?

2822
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:58,820
Oh.

2823
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,420
Oh.

2824
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:02,880
Oh.

2825
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:09,270
It does help, just not as much.

2826
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:09,810
Okay.

2827
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:14,870
Bonus damage.

2828
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:15,610
I don't know.

2829
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:18,450
Yeah.

2830
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:21,550
Because I took out those guys in one hit, which usually I do not do.

2831
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:44,430
Finish him!

2832
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:45,330
Finish him!

2833
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:46,750
Finish him!

2834
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:47,510
Finish him!

2835
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:49,490
So, it is...

2836
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:52,610
I think it is technically stronger, maybe a little bit, but...

2837
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:56,970
It looks prettier now.

2838
02:10:57,030 --> 02:10:57,950
It looks like an enchanter.

2839
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,030
So, let's...

2840
02:10:58,050 --> 02:10:59,590
I just did a Minecraft weapon.

2841
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:17,270
Just keep spamming!

2842
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:18,250
Just keep spamming!

2843
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:19,370
Just keep spamming!

2844
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:20,350
Just keep spamming!

2845
02:11:22,530 --> 02:11:23,370
Oh, I caught him!

2846
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:26,810
Oh, these guys are getting back up!

2847
02:11:37,980 --> 02:11:39,080
Oh, it's just you guys.

2848
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:39,400
Okay.

2849
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:40,580
Finish him!

2850
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:41,260
Finish him!

2851
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:43,880
Run, run, run, run, run!

2852
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,260
Run, run, run, run, run!

2853
02:11:58,220 --> 02:11:58,860
Finish him!

2854
02:11:59,020 --> 02:11:59,100
Finish him!

2855
02:11:59,100 --> 02:11:59,460
Finish him!

2856
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:03,040
Oh my god!

2857
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:03,600
Oh my god!

2858
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:03,940
Oh my god!

2859
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:04,320
Oh my god!

2860
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:05,480
Oh my god!

2861
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:11,440
It screws up my controls!

2862
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:13,160
Oh gosh!

2863
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:13,640
Oh gosh!

2864
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:13,980
Oh gosh!

2865
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:14,220
Oh gosh!

2866
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:15,080
There's two of them though!

2867
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:23,460
Wait.

2868
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:25,940
Hello?

2869
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,760
Wait.

2870
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,760
What?

2871
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:44,940
I one-shot him!

2872
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,180
Yeah!

2873
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:47,160
Finish him!

2874
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:47,840
Finish him!

2875
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:55,000
I did it!

2876
02:12:58,380 --> 02:12:59,220
Yippee!

2877
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:01,820
I did it!

2878
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:03,480
I got Sanctus Seladon!

2879
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,720
Your Honor, she is cracked!

2880
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:10,900
Oh.

2881
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,060
Um.

2882
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:22,150
My gaming activates in the weirdest ways.

2883
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:23,770
My health is not so great, but whatever.

2884
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:25,790
Wait, so...what is this?

2885
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:26,130
Oh.

2886
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:27,930
Hi, Karim.

2887
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:30,430
Shaped like a delicate dome.

2888
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:33,690
A pale blue statuette floats gracefully above the pedestal.

2889
02:13:33,770 --> 02:13:35,510
Should Kareem claim this artifact?

2890
02:13:36,610 --> 02:13:37,210
Yeah.

2891
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:40,430
If I find it, it's mine.

2892
02:13:41,510 --> 02:13:41,890
Kareem.

2893
02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:44,890
We will be together forever.

2894
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:46,130
Chandra?

2895
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:46,830
Chandra!

2896
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:52,510
What happened to you?

2897
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:55,410
Things change, my dear Kareem.

2898
02:13:56,130 --> 02:14:00,290
But even though my body is ravaged, I await you.

2899
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:01,850
Who did this to you?

2900
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:04,110
You were gone so long.

2901
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:05,970
Wait, how long was I gone for?

2902
02:14:08,390 --> 02:14:08,950
Chandra!

2903
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:11,890
Chandra!

2904
02:14:13,490 --> 02:14:15,550
And in cruel revenge...

2905
02:14:15,550 --> 02:14:16,050
You!

2906
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:18,130
Oh my god.

2907
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:21,450
As the last blades were drawn across my body...

2908
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:23,230
You wench!

2909
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:27,570
She cursed that I would only be with another in death.

2910
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:30,590
So much for thinking only of me.

2911
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:31,690
Oh, you talent!

2912
02:14:32,410 --> 02:14:32,970
You!

2913
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:36,050
I have seen my folly and have already paid dearly.

2914
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:36,850
You talent!

2915
02:14:37,510 --> 02:14:38,850
I see so much more now.

2916
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:43,910
In death, I know the true value of the artifact which I asked you to find.

2917
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:45,550
She's not even thinking of me still.

2918
02:14:45,650 --> 02:14:46,650
And it is none for us to possess.

2919
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:52,110
If we are to be together again, you must make a sacrifice.

2920
02:14:52,990 --> 02:14:55,410
She's just like, thinking of only one artifact.

2921
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:57,770
Sacrifice?

2922
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:01,770
Why should I do anything for you?

2923
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:04,350
You lied to me.

2924
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:06,070
Betrayed me.

2925
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:09,690
And you really don't deserve me anymore.

2926
02:15:09,790 --> 02:15:11,950
You must forget the past.

2927
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:12,530
Oh, girl!

2928
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:17,790
Despite who you are now, you will also become something more.

2929
02:15:18,350 --> 02:15:19,810
Just as I have.

2930
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:23,410
But the sacrifice must be made.

2931
02:15:23,770 --> 02:15:23,830
But the sacrifice must be made.

2932
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:26,550
We must remain here and guard the artifact.

2933
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:27,350
We must remain here and guard the artifact.

2934
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:29,770
Dark things will come to claim it.

2935
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:32,390
And you must be strong to keep it from them.

2936
02:15:32,890 --> 02:15:34,570
Without your sacrifice.

2937
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:35,830
I think she's cuter this way.

2938
02:15:35,970 --> 02:15:38,870
The world will fall into eternal darkness.

2939
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:40,130
Eternal darkness!

2940
02:15:41,450 --> 02:15:42,790
The things I do for love.

2941
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:44,210
The things I do for love.

2942
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:45,430
Okay, courage, the cowardly dog.

2943
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:53,570
That's what would happen if you kissed me too.

2944
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:58,710
I'd put glue in your mouth.

2945
02:15:58,830 --> 02:15:59,750
Or something like that.

2946
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:00,890
I don't know what just happened.

2947
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:10,840
What the heck is going on?

2948
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:14,700
I'm gonna fix my sanity.

2949
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:21,140
Since apparently, Alex is not doing so well.

2950
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,260
She is a little...

2951
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,220
Nice.

2952
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:29,840
You guys are sick.

2953
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:34,040
Is this the...

2954
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:36,560
Some kind of mask.

2955
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:37,800
Oh, it's serene.

2956
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,040
I was thinking of the one from...

2957
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:40,880
What's it called?

2958
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:43,300
How the guy was just like, it's contorted.

2959
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:44,180
It's disturbing.

2960
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,240
It's spitting out blood from its...

2961
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:50,280
It's spitting out something disgusting from its mouth.

2962
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,860
I thought it was the same thing.

2963
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:54,600
But no, this guy is serene.

2964
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:55,580
And like...

2965
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:57,220
You know, he's chilling.

2966
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:01,380
Now, we can go...

2967
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:01,740
Wait.

2968
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:05,820
Actually, I'm not sure if we can open that door.

2969
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,640
I don't know if we have...

2970
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:10,120
The runes.

2971
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,420
There's also...

2972
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:14,400
This room here.

2973
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:17,840
Give it a shot.

2974
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:18,400
Okay.

2975
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:26,230
My sanity is normal though.

2976
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,590
Hello?

2977
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:37,620
What just happened?

2978
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:41,220
My sanity?

2979
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:42,040
Is fine?

2980
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:44,640
Okay.

2981
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,160
Oh my gosh.

2982
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,240
Thank you for all the Super Chats!

2983
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:48,740
You got any artifacts you need us to find?

2984
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,380
No reason.

2985
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,920
Kareem's pain at the end there is basically what we experience every time Mint is late.

2986
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:56,420
No.

2987
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:58,960
It's a hundred times worse.

2988
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:01,280
When I'm late.

2989
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,120
It's a hundred times worse.

2990
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,120
Who was found?

2991
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:04,900
Super Chat.

2992
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,420
Super Chat if you let Mint blue in your...

2993
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,280
I hate this!

2994
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,060
Oh, it is green.

2995
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:15,920
Just kidding.

2996
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:21,060
I'm not going to quick spell it since...

2997
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:25,120
On you.

2998
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:26,140
Gladius.

2999
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,520
Enter my heart.

3000
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:32,620
After this I have no mouth and I must scream.

3001
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:35,120
Now we can use it.

3002
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:39,660
For some reason I kept thinking it was purple.

3003
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:41,980
Oh.

3004
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:42,260
What?

3005
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:43,080
It's not even a room.

3006
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:46,140
Dirt.

3007
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:51,180
Among the pantry contents is a spice jar with a scrap of paper hidden inside.

3008
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:52,840
Among the pantry contents is a spice jar with a scrap of paper hidden inside.

3009
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:53,600
Spice jar!

3010
02:18:54,260 --> 02:18:55,560
She got us blue.

3011
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:01,720
The kitchen is as empty as the library is full.

3012
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:02,540
The kitchen is as empty as the library is full.

3013
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:03,660
It's a reflection of her grandfather's attitude.

3014
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,500
Always learning, reading, studying.

3015
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:06,480
Rather than eating.

3016
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:09,180
Maybe that's why you died, grandpa.

3017
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:11,500
Peepaw.

3018
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,860
If you have to rank them so far, where would you put the stories?

3019
02:19:19,380 --> 02:19:20,260
If you have to rank them so far, where would you put the stories?

3020
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:22,360
I actually really liked Anthony's.

3021
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:23,700
So far.

3022
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:25,340
I thought that one was kind of fun.

3023
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,160
Let's check our spice jar.

3024
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,880
Firmly sealed glass spice jar.

3025
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:36,420
The faint aroma of Arabian spices is tantalizingly emanating from it.

3026
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,140
There's a piece of paper inside it.

3027
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:39,480
Yes, we shall...

3028
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:39,860
Oh!

3029
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,800
The lurking horror!

3030
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:42,780
Oh boy!

3031
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:45,200
Did you get the red statue?

3032
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:45,680
I did!

3033
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,860
What's happening?

3034
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:04,120
This looks like the shadow realm we were at.

3035
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,560
My

3036
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:10,480
liege.

3037
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,060
The future is yours.

3038
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:17,800
The light in the age of darkness has been extinguished.

3039
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:21,300
The pillar of flesh has been constructed.

3040
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,840
The master of chaos.

3041
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,840
The keeper of the ancients.

3042
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:27,620
Is long dead.

3043
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:30,500
The planets will be in alignment soon.

3044
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:31,160
No!

3045
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:33,420
All is prepared for your arrival.

3046
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,040
Oh no!

3047
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:36,280
I will begin the final incantation.

3048
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:38,540
That will bring you into our world.

3049
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:40,020
Within days.

3050
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:40,720
Days?

3051
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:45,880
The next millennium will truly usher in a new age.

3052
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,180
Your guardians.

3053
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:49,800
Now prepare the gate.

3054
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:56,560
Favorite chapter, favorite character.

3055
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:58,340
By the way, you can examine the weapons for details.

3056
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,880
Wait, is the spice jar one of your favorites?

3057
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:01,300
What do you mean?

3058
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:02,220
Roses are red.

3059
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:03,460
Mint's kisses are blue.

3060
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:04,600
Like all these wisps.

3061
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,140
I'm a simp too.

3062
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,300
Hahaha.

3063
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:12,780
Okay, okay.

3064
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:15,140
Let's calm down a little bit.

3065
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:15,620
Let's...

3066
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:17,400
We're not...

3067
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:19,900
Oh, that's my body.

3068
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:22,320
Oh my gosh, I thought there was a person standing behind me.

3069
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:22,940
Woo!

3070
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:26,500
After playing this game back in the day, my friends and I adopted.

3071
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,520
New term for crazy classmates.

3072
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,040
Slightly slanted.

3073
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:30,740
Hahaha.

3074
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:33,620
The flesh pillar.

3075
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:35,180
We have a...

3076
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:36,880
Ew.

3077
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:39,200
It's whispering to us.

3078
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,240
We still have this dresser key.

3079
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:43,980
That I haven't used yet.

3080
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:47,420
I wonder if I can go find it.

3081
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,060
Maybe...

3082
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:52,160
In one of these rooms up here.

3083
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:53,840
Oh.

3084
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:56,120
Sorry.

3085
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:57,480
Oh my gosh.

3086
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,200
It hissed at me.

3087
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:03,300
The statue isn't moving anymore.

3088
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,920
Because I'm not crazy.

3089
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:05,120
Crazy!

3090
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:10,680
The door took that first leap.

3091
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:11,880
That's what I'm saying.

3092
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:13,200
Oh!

3093
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:14,420
I got more ammunition.

3094
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,340
Nice.

3095
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,880
I don't know how I found that.

3096
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,260
But very cool.

3097
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:23,940
I don't see any...

3098
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,700
Or rather...

3099
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:25,280
Wait!

3100
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:32,440
No, it said it has no keyhole.

3101
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:38,340
Do I enchant the key?

3102
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:40,620
Let me try...

3103
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:41,400
Enchanting the key.

3104
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:48,350
Oh, it can't be...

3105
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:49,090
Enchanted.

3106
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:50,990
Okay...

3107
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:56,750
I need a keyblade.

3108
02:22:58,350 --> 02:22:59,810
I don't have those runes.

3109
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:01,270
Yes I do!

3110
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:02,610
This one?

3111
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:04,230
I have this one.

3112
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:10,340
Hmm...

3113
02:23:19,970 --> 02:23:21,110
What's that baby...

3114
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:22,630
What are those babies doing there?

3115
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:25,730
What is going on in this painting?

3116
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:28,350
What is going on in this painting?

3117
02:23:28,350 --> 02:23:28,590
Why is the...

3118
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:32,480
Why is the baby flailing?

3119
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,100
Woohoo!

3120
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:35,600
Spring break!

3121
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,680
I feel like I can do this.

3122
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:43,480
I feel like I can do this.

3123
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:45,720
I need a drawer for some means of unlocking it, but...

3124
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,080
Can find none.

3125
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:49,100
However, the key is definitely a dresser key.

3126
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:51,280
Okay, so maybe we can't...

3127
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:53,320
Do that one yet.

3128
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:56,080
Create a spell?

3129
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,820
I wonder if we...

3130
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:59,680
Do we have the rune...

3131
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:01,540
Do we have the runes for it?

3132
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:03,880
Item...

3133
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:05,120
No.

3134
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:07,540
Nope.

3135
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,080
Item...

3136
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:10,880
Projection?

3137
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:14,580
This is the one we made before, isn't it?

3138
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:20,280
Absorb item?

3139
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:21,480
Oh no.

3140
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:23,680
Wait, what did I just make?

3141
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,580
Oh no, this is the...

3142
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:27,100
Okay, just kidding.

3143
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:27,720
This is the one.

3144
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:28,980
Item... Absorb!

3145
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:32,620
Enchant the key?

3146
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:33,300
It wouldn't let me.

3147
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:34,020
I tried already.

3148
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:36,740
Unless...

3149
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:39,940
Enchant item.

3150
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:40,440
Cast.

3151
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:42,320
Green.

3152
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,020
Yeah, see?

3153
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,720
This item cannot be enchanted.

3154
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:46,740
Hmm...

3155
02:24:48,140 --> 02:24:48,580
Mysterious.

3156
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,020
So mysterious.

3157
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:53,900
Okay, well we know where it goes to now at least.

3158
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:54,640
Or maybe.

3159
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:56,980
It did say it's a dresser key and...

3160
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:58,920
That was a dresser.

3161
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:01,360
And that's the only thing we have...

3162
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:03,380
To open.

3163
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,280
I believe.

3164
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:07,240
Also, I like how it says this room is basically a museum.

3165
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:08,680
Isn't that a phone right there?

3166
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:12,940
Isn't that a phone right there?

3167
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:13,400
Isn't that a phone right there?

3168
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:15,000
And it's on.

3169
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:18,320
And also, this lamp is on?

3170
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:20,760
Someone's definitely been in here.

3171
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:21,480
I mean...

3172
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:24,620
Cast green spell near the thing?

3173
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:25,580
Okay, let's try it.

3174
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,020
What, like the one to restore my sanity?

3175
02:25:35,450 --> 02:25:35,930
What,

3176
02:25:42,050 --> 02:25:42,050
like the one to restore my sanity?

3177
02:25:42,050 --> 02:25:42,330
Well,

3178
02:25:45,890 --> 02:25:46,750
alright.

3179
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:49,090
Let's go read this chapter, I suppose.

3180
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:51,310
Yeah, I don't have the right spell.

3181
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:51,950
That's what I'm figuring.

3182
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:54,130
Okie dokie.

3183
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:56,930
Wow, it's already been two and a half hours.

3184
02:25:56,990 --> 02:25:58,510
What, we've gotten through two stories?

3185
02:26:00,990 --> 02:26:02,410
How many chapters are there?

3186
02:26:02,510 --> 02:26:03,730
How many chapters are there?

3187
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:05,290
How many chapters are there?

3188
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:08,570
How many chapters are there?

3189
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:12,430
How many chapters are there?

3190
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:13,930
How many chapters are there?

3191
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:15,170
How many chapters are there?

3192
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:15,310
What's it come from?

3193
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:19,090
How had my ancestor stumbled upon it?

3194
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:20,350
The Lurking Whore.

3195
02:26:20,510 --> 02:26:22,650
I feverishly began to read more.

3196
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:25,170
Eager to learn his story.

3197
02:26:26,730 --> 02:26:30,230
It seems that Maximilian had inherited his father's mansion.

3198
02:26:30,570 --> 02:26:31,170
The best chapter?

3199
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:31,870
Just as I had.

3200
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:34,930
Alone since the death of his wife.

3201
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:38,450
And since his children had their own adult lives.

3202
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:39,910
And since his children had their own adult lives.

3203
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:42,690
He explored the house to discover his family roots.

3204
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:45,150
It's the next chapter.

3205
02:26:45,170 --> 02:26:46,650
What, the one with the gun?

3206
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:55,050
It has been two weeks since the death of my father.

3207
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:58,470
And it has finally come to me to look over the mansion.

3208
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:01,610
Now, I am truly alone.

3209
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:05,790
I am forced to start a new life here in Rhode Island.

3210
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:09,830
I intend to make the mansion mine.

3211
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:12,670
And live in it as my forefathers have.

3212
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:13,210
Wait!

3213
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:14,770
To continue the family tradition.

3214
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:17,870
Get this guy a chair, please.

3215
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:19,250
A mansion has its secrets, I'm sure.

3216
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:21,570
And in my time here...

3217
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:23,970
I have to make them...

3218
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:24,750
mine.

3219
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:29,630
The viewers and chat are discussing a variety of different topics.

3220
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:31,690
Some are talking about weapons and spells being used.

3221
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:34,510
While others are discussing the streamer's baby in background art.

3222
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:35,830
While others are discussing the streamer's baby in background art.

3223
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:37,010
My baby!

3224
02:27:39,790 --> 02:27:40,470
Oh boy!

3225
02:27:40,790 --> 02:27:42,230
I got some pist... oh no!

3226
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:45,930
A desk cluttered with notes and writs.

3227
02:27:45,930 --> 02:27:48,630
It's mostly business to do with the Roivis estate.

3228
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:51,670
Is this like the... the witch?

3229
02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:53,230
The witch trials?

3230
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:58,390
Small collection of Maximillian's medical journals.

3231
02:27:58,510 --> 02:27:59,330
References and reports.

3232
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:02,330
Can I take that?

3233
02:28:04,730 --> 02:28:05,830
The music?

3234
02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:13,150
Is that my dad?

3235
02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:15,510
That's George Washington?

3236
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:17,270
Mr. Washington?

3237
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:23,570
I'm forced to be here on Rhode Island.

3238
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:26,510
I want to be back in Britain.

3239
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:30,390
Oh, it's a different... thing.

3240
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,130
Interesting.

3241
02:28:34,810 --> 02:28:36,710
The witch's trials were the 1600s.

3242
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:37,450
Oh dang, you're right.

3243
02:28:39,690 --> 02:28:40,210
Maybe.

3244
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:42,470
Oh, what's going on in here?

3245
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:44,230
Hello, sir?

3246
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:46,570
Oh, can I pick up?

3247
02:28:47,090 --> 02:28:48,350
I found more ammunition!

3248
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:50,350
Oh.

3249
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:50,890
Hello?

3250
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,590
Oh, there we go.

3251
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:53,590
The servant is preoccupied with his duties.

3252
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:57,090
Look at the face I'm giving at the camera.

3253
02:28:57,510 --> 02:28:59,050
He owns a musket for home defense.

3254
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:00,910
As the founding fathers intended.

3255
02:29:01,570 --> 02:29:02,130
Oh!

3256
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:03,830
Can I shoot this guy?

3257
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:05,030
No.

3258
02:29:07,770 --> 02:29:08,990
Maximillian's medical journal.

3259
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:11,830
Used to take notes on medical and pathological analyses.

3260
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:15,110
Okay.

3261
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:18,190
Yes, clean my floor.

3262
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:19,430
No, no, no, no.

3263
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:20,150
Come here, come here.

3264
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:24,900
Clean my floor.

3265
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:27,780
State of the art interior.

3266
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:28,520
Outhouse!

3267
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:32,620
Polished cheek and mahogany finish.

3268
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:34,620
It is truly a sight to behold.

3269
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:35,720
And experience.

3270
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:39,100
Oh boy.

3271
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,780
I didn't realize this was the bathroom.

3272
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:41,780
The smell.

3273
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:43,200
I'm getting out of here.

3274
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:45,420
We could have just walked in on this guy.

3275
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:47,180
Doing his...

3276
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:48,700
Oh, that's what his duties are!

3277
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:49,940
Oh my god!

3278
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:55,520
The door to the servant's quarters is securely locked.

3279
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:58,920
Maximillian, however, can't help but feel uneasy.

3280
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,620
An ominous presence lurks behind that door.

3281
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:05,340
Making the hairs on his neck stand on end.

3282
02:30:06,910 --> 02:30:08,000
I still have...

3283
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,740
What is this music?

3284
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:16,420
Oh yes!

3285
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:17,060
The ghost!

3286
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:19,400
A stained glass window.

3287
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:23,180
Resplendent with bright colors and exquisite workmanship.

3288
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:27,040
There is something odd about it.

3289
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:29,780
Perhaps the curious detail of its shapes and content.

3290
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:33,480
Or maybe that the sun is like a bloodied eye?

3291
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:34,260
I don't know.

3292
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,340
Might be the weird part about it.

3293
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:42,980
It sounds like a bird is singing the song.

3294
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,500
A gritty portrait of a man with an overbearing countenance.

3295
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:52,520
Hardly a reassuring soul.

3296
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:55,940
Maximillian wonders if that trait was prevalent in his ancestors.

3297
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:02,120
Why can't I look at every painting?

3298
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:11,440
I'm getting a lot of ammunition here.

3299
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:12,700
I'm kind of nervous.

3300
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:15,820
Skellies.

3301
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,180
Okay.

3302
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:28,700
Oh.

3303
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:30,820
On the bedside table is an open letter.

3304
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:33,800
I found a letter.

3305
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:36,500
Letter number one.

3306
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:39,920
A letter written with some precision and long hand.

3307
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:41,860
Dear friend.

3308
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:46,420
The antiquity of which you ask is indeed the tome of eternal darkness.

3309
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,240
Or a copy of it.

3310
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:49,520
At least.

3311
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:51,560
The secrets are still hidden from me.

3312
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:53,500
For I have been unable to read it.

3313
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:55,320
As most scholars who have tried.

3314
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:58,020
It will remain within the sanctity of the mansion.

3315
02:31:58,280 --> 02:32:01,000
For in the wrong hands it would be a powerful weapon.

3316
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:02,640
Peruse it if you will.

3317
02:32:02,740 --> 02:32:04,040
But beware its magic.

3318
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:06,380
It is a harsh mistress.

3319
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,560
Erin Roivas.

3320
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:12,080
Where's the book?

3321
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,920
Oh my gosh.

3322
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:15,580
There's a rune up here.

3323
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:18,140
Stone tablet.

3324
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:18,440
Yeah.

3325
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:20,560
I'll take that.

3326
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:22,180
Thank you.

3327
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,660
What are you doing there guy?

3328
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:30,760
The servant mutters under his breath.

3329
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:32,380
Not realizing that Max is nearby.

3330
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:35,980
He appears to be distressed at his lot in life.

3331
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,380
Working all the time.

3332
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:43,120
We've had the baby picture for centuries.

3333
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:54,100
But he's not here yet.

3334
02:32:54,100 --> 02:32:54,840
State of the art.

3335
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,380
A mirror's grim reflection.

3336
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:59,080
Returns Max's questioning gaze.

3337
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:01,480
His face racked with sleepless nights.

3338
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:02,840
And a strange gleam in his eye.

3339
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,160
Hint at a growingly odd demeanor.

3340
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:09,000
Oh.

3341
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,200
Ammunition.

3342
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:13,080
There's a lot of ammunition here.

3343
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:14,600
I mean good.

3344
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:15,480
Thank goodness.

3345
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:21,180
I just don't understand.

3346
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:22,500
What are you doing?

3347
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,540
Are you cleaning with your hand?

3348
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:27,380
Like you're just brushing the dirt under the rug?

3349
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:28,140
What is the...

3350
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,860
What are your duties?

3351
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:32,040
What do they entail?

3352
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:35,020
Like what are you actually doing?

3353
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,520
I don't understand.

3354
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:39,920
There he goes again.

3355
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:42,900
He's just brushing it under the dresser now.

3356
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:46,840
He lost his context.

3357
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:53,420
A luxurious fire warms the master bedroom.

3358
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:57,420
Its flickering light gives both a soft aura to the room's somber decor.

3359
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:00,400
And an ominous side to the shadows.

3360
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:04,520
What happened to our cool music?

3361
02:34:08,490 --> 02:34:09,170
No!

3362
02:34:09,310 --> 02:34:10,630
Where's our cool music?

3363
02:34:17,620 --> 02:34:18,560
Someone's walking.

3364
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:21,380
A maid!

3365
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:21,540
A maid!

3366
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:24,360
Oh?

3367
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:27,200
What is this?

3368
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:27,800
Whoa!

3369
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:30,320
I'm getting dizzy.

3370
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:32,900
Why is he frozen over there?

3371
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:34,440
Hello?

3372
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:37,640
A maid.

3373
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:42,500
Whilst performing her duties, the servant makes idle chit chat about the room's temperature.

3374
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:46,240
Pulling from the weather deck.

3375
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:49,460
Turn around, maid!

3376
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:49,860
Turn around, maid!

3377
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:52,840
She's looking around.

3378
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:54,680
She's like, what other wallpaper can I stroke?

3379
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:56,400
Oh god.

3380
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:57,480
Wait, the maid has trapped...

3381
02:34:57,480 --> 02:34:58,600
You guys, the maid has trapped me in.

3382
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:00,080
Wait, I actually can't leave.

3383
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:00,960
Wait, you guys!

3384
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:01,940
You guys, you guys!

3385
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:02,720
Oh thank god.

3386
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:07,160
I was getting capitoned by the maid.

3387
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:13,020
That was exciting.

3388
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:15,820
Letter.

3389
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:26,600
A letter scrawled by a panicked hand with clotted ink.

3390
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:28,800
A letter scrawled by a panicked hand with clotted ink.

3391
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,760
Forsaken by the ancients.

3392
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:33,400
I dare not enter it for fear of my mortal soul.

3393
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,400
I would suggest that you leave also.

3394
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:36,440
Bring the book.

3395
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:38,540
It is a far more potent tool than you have learned.

3396
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:41,160
And may well swing the balance in our favor.

3397
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:41,700
A.

3398
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:42,300
Roivas.

3399
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:43,920
Maid stuck!

3400
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:44,780
Maid stuck!

3401
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:47,720
Uh oh.

3402
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:49,180
I think the house is...

3403
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:50,480
Bad?

3404
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:57,280
I think this is the same description that Alex gives it.

3405
02:35:58,140 --> 02:35:58,780
I think this is the same description that Alex gives it.

3406
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:02,500
I'm confused why I was able to look over the banister like that.

3407
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:06,720
Examine.

3408
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:09,000
Like...

3409
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,440
Oh my god.

3410
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,560
I feel like I'm getting motion sickness from this.

3411
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:17,460
I think this house is kind of bad, you guys.

3412
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:18,560
I'm getting a bit of a feeling.

3413
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,640
At least these guys keep the lights on.

3414
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:24,980
Oh, another rune.

3415
02:36:29,570 --> 02:36:30,890
I'm getting all these runes.

3416
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:32,110
But I'm not getting any...

3417
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:33,230
Book?

3418
02:36:34,550 --> 02:36:35,070
Oh.

3419
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:37,310
Is that a baseball bat?

3420
02:36:39,010 --> 02:36:41,610
A pump handle is sitting on the barrel inside the pantry.

3421
02:36:42,750 --> 02:36:43,270
A pump handle is sitting on the barrel inside the pantry.

3422
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:43,950
I'll take that.

3423
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,980
Cozy fireplace is the focal point of the kitchen.

3424
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:02,560
Lending a good deal of warmth to the austere room at night.

3425
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:04,480
Hello.

3426
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:08,460
I think I'm a good...

3427
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:08,520
Master.

3428
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:16,640
With a kind smile, she asks if Maximilian has an appetite as she is preparing a hearty meal for the evening.

3429
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:16,900
See?

3430
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:17,840
She's so kind.

3431
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:20,100
She's so nice.

3432
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:22,240
What about you?

3433
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:23,480
Are you nice to me?

3434
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:25,180
Do you like me?

3435
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:30,940
Whilst going about her duties, the servant casually remarks about a strange quality hanging in the air.

3436
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,440
This odd comment makes Maximilian feel like something is quite amiss.

3437
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:36,120
Why would she say that?

3438
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,520
There's that other guy walking.

3439
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:52,780
Why did the music stop?

3440
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:00,540
Yippee!

3441
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:01,780
We get the good music back!

3442
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,820
Oh, this guy right here.

3443
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:06,540
I wanted to...

3444
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:09,240
Everybody's just sweeping with their hands.

3445
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:10,280
I can't afford brooms?

3446
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:12,800
I own this whole mansion and I can't afford a broom?

3447
02:38:13,060 --> 02:38:13,940
What is this?

3448
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:18,600
Bidding Maximilian a courteous good day, the servant returns to his duties.

3449
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:34,740
Hello, sir?

3450
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,680
Good day to you, goodnight to you?

3451
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,860
The servant inquires if Maximilian requires anything of service.

3452
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:45,460
Oh.

3453
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,020
Oh, yeah, I get it!

3454
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:54,060
There's something written beneath the image.

3455
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:57,260
When darkness spreads its wings before my master...

3456
02:38:58,360 --> 02:38:58,960
mmmm...

3457
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:02,140
Anti-cool-esque.

3458
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,560
Backwards-cool-esque.

3459
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:06,280
Zellatoth's greatest foe.

3460
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:07,920
The path to truth will be open.

3461
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:09,060
Bird!

3462
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,860
Oh, the true foe?

3463
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:18,260
So it would be this one.

3464
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:20,760
Aha!

3465
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:22,680
Uh-oh.

3466
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:25,580
Oh, enter secret passageway.

3467
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,000
Wait, not yet, not yet, not yet.

3468
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:28,800
The uncool S.

3469
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:33,860
The cool Z.

3470
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:35,680
Hold on.

3471
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:38,080
We have a few more over here.

3472
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:39,960
Sorry, I know I'm...

3473
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:40,120
Oh!

3474
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:43,000
Is anybody gonna...

3475
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:50,420
Nobody's gonna comment on the sigil that's just on the wall, the glowing sigil.

3476
02:39:52,300 --> 02:39:56,380
An oil painting of the mansion's foyer hangs on the wall.

3477
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,320
Sorry, foyer.

3478
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:06,260
Max wonders why the artist would paint an inaccurate picture of one end of the room with such detail and clarity that it approaches realism.

3479
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:11,180
What a strange thing.

3480
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:15,360
Pokémon.

3481
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:18,360
I see no sigil.

3482
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:19,320
Shut up.

3483
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:20,280
Foyay.

3484
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:22,360
Foyette?

3485
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:23,300
No, foyay.

3486
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:24,960
Foyay!

3487
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:25,740
Foyippee!

3488
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:33,920
The illustration features a collection of strange line designs related to each other in a cyclical manner.

3489
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:38,800
There appears to be some significance to it, but it isn't particularly evident.

3490
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:45,300
The wall is decorated with a colored triangular design.

3491
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:49,900
Kimi wa dare to kisu wo sunu?

3492
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,740
Although Max has seen this...

3493
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:57,800
I think I just understood why the song is called Triangular.

3494
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:59,880
Is it because it's about a love triangle?

3495
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:04,320
The first line is like, who are you going to kiss?

3496
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:08,340
Kimi wa dare to kisu...

3497
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:09,400
Oh my god.

3498
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:11,020
It just occurred to me.

3499
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:15,400
Oh my gosh!

3500
02:41:18,260 --> 02:41:20,060
This is all a macross, truly.

3501
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:26,260
It's literally the plot.

3502
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:28,220
I know, I just never thought of it.

3503
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:35,160
I just never thought of it.

3504
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:38,120
The wall is decorated with a colored triangular design.

3505
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,800
Although Max has seen this particular embellishment.

3506
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:41,620
Time and time again.

3507
02:41:41,740 --> 02:41:43,340
Its significance still evades him.

3508
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:45,540
They didn't tell this guy anything.

3509
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:47,340
Okay.

3510
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:52,220
Now we may go into our tiny hole.

3511
02:41:58,410 --> 02:41:59,490
The love triangle.

3512
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:00,490
So funny.

3513
02:42:00,970 --> 02:42:01,850
Here we go!

3514
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:06,990
It's this room!

3515
02:42:07,450 --> 02:42:08,670
Cheryl or Ranka?

3516
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:08,770
Ranka.

3517
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:15,450
I think maybe if I were to watch it again, I would pick Cheryl.

3518
02:42:15,730 --> 02:42:17,710
But my heart is still Ranka.

3519
02:42:19,730 --> 02:42:23,570
A curled scroll of aged parchment sits atop the stack of dusty books.

3520
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:25,930
It is covered with strange diagrams and writing.

3521
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:28,970
Reveal invisible!

3522
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:30,830
Woo!

3523
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:33,070
Oh.

3524
02:42:33,770 --> 02:42:34,870
A saber!

3525
02:42:37,550 --> 02:42:38,110
Saber!

3526
02:42:40,470 --> 02:42:41,390
There's the book.

3527
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:42,290
Oh.

3528
02:42:44,990 --> 02:42:45,470
Nothing?

3529
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:45,870
Okay.

3530
02:42:46,330 --> 02:42:47,510
What else is in here?

3531
02:42:48,490 --> 02:42:49,290
A gun!

3532
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:55,990
An aged flintlock pistol rests on a display stand fixed to the wall.

3533
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:58,750
Flintlock pistol?

3534
02:42:58,830 --> 02:42:59,870
But we've been getting...

3535
02:42:59,870 --> 02:43:00,370
Wait, no.

3536
02:43:00,410 --> 02:43:01,930
We got revolver ammunition before.

3537
02:43:02,470 --> 02:43:04,150
Oh, now I can duel them!

3538
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:07,390
I can duel wield!

3539
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,810
Okay.

3540
02:43:11,070 --> 02:43:12,430
Let's grab the tome.

3541
02:43:14,390 --> 02:43:16,170
The way he's just standing at it.

3542
02:43:17,810 --> 02:43:19,950
Lying amidst the papers on the desk.

3543
02:43:20,790 --> 02:43:21,570
Oh my god.

3544
02:43:21,710 --> 02:43:22,330
Can I stop you?

3545
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:22,970
I'm so sorry.

3546
02:43:23,130 --> 02:43:24,530
It's a strange leather-bound book.

3547
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:25,930
Should Max pick up the book?

3548
02:43:26,090 --> 02:43:26,350
Yes.

3549
02:43:28,010 --> 02:43:29,110
Duel wielding, baby.

3550
02:43:34,210 --> 02:43:34,670
Oh!

3551
02:43:35,490 --> 02:43:36,470
Are you kidding me?

3552
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:45,560
As Max lifts the tome of eternal darkness, a letter slips out from between the pages.

3553
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:49,060
Deftly, Max catches it as it drops toward the floor.

3554
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:52,840
Um...

3555
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:53,820
Um...

3556
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:55,380
Wait, but my people are gonna die!

3557
02:43:58,660 --> 02:44:01,100
The letter scrawled almost indes...

3558
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:04,180
...cypherably by a wavering hand.

3559
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:05,120
Dear friend.

3560
02:44:05,300 --> 02:44:07,100
As I suspected the ruins of...

3561
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:08,000
Enga?

3562
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:15,540
Tell your lads that blasted necropolis lie deep under the site of the mansion.

3563
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:22,200
The accursed servants of Zelotath are so close I can almost hear their chittering!

3564
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:24,440
What?

3565
02:44:24,620 --> 02:44:28,140
There is a secret opening in the basement and from there we can gain access.

3566
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:33,060
I urge you to gather some men and seal it or better still destroy that damned place.

3567
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:36,960
I have stowed something that you will find useful on the upper level.

3568
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:38,860
Look to the light and you will find it.

3569
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:39,440
Oh, yes.

3570
02:44:40,220 --> 02:44:40,960
Two shots.

3571
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:42,920
Spins split on pistols.

3572
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:44,780
This time I got two shots.

3573
02:44:47,400 --> 02:44:52,280
I wish that I could be at your side but my ailment worsens daily and I know that my time is short.

3574
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,400
A.R.

3575
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,840
I won't forgive you if you let that cute maid...

3576
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:57,060
...maid die.

3577
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:58,840
No, no, the other cute maid.

3578
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:01,160
Okay, let's equip our guns.

3579
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:15,200
Oh my god.

3580
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,020
He's punching me!

3581
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:32,620
Oh my god.

3582
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,460
I'm sorry.

3583
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:34,900
This is...

3584
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:35,340
This...

3585
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:36,240
New weapon everybody.

3586
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:37,340
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3587
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:38,460
New weapon.

3588
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:39,560
Oh my god.

3589
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:40,900
Please, I'm stuck.

3590
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:41,780
Please.

3591
02:45:41,900 --> 02:45:42,500
Please stop.

3592
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,220
Stop following me so...

3593
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:45,560
I'm going to switch to the sword.

3594
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,540
Oh.

3595
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,860
I'll charge you.

3596
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:54,840
Servant!

3597
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:56,280
Why must you...

3598
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,000
Oh my god.

3599
02:45:58,840 --> 02:45:59,660
It's this...

3600
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:00,740
It's this damn thing.

3601
02:46:00,860 --> 02:46:01,360
Oh my god, no.

3602
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:02,020
Please.

3603
02:46:06,970 --> 02:46:08,090
No, don't open the door.

3604
02:46:08,210 --> 02:46:09,390
Attempt autopsy?

3605
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,510
I can't believe this.

3606
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:15,510
What am I...

3607
02:46:16,270 --> 02:46:18,970
A new entry has been placed in Maximilian's medical journal.

3608
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:21,010
It can be accessed from the journal section of the tome.

3609
02:46:21,430 --> 02:46:21,850
What?

3610
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:24,490
When the autopsy...

3611
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:31,530
When an autopsy has been performed, Max can view the new entry by turning to the journal section of the tome and selecting autopsy at the bottom of the page.

3612
02:46:31,530 --> 02:46:35,690
Select the autopsy to view using up-down.

3613
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:37,110
Pressing A will display it.

3614
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:39,950
Whoa!

3615
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:45,110
Would you prefer to do laps around this room or the MGS1 tower?

3616
02:46:46,350 --> 02:46:48,510
I think the MGS1 tower.

3617
02:46:49,330 --> 02:46:52,610
The creature wears the skin of people to protect itself.

3618
02:46:53,610 --> 02:46:55,030
Bone thief!

3619
02:46:58,250 --> 02:46:58,610
Oh.

3620
02:46:59,370 --> 02:46:59,730
Ah!

3621
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:01,830
Yeah, take that!

3622
02:47:02,290 --> 02:47:02,830
Bozo.

3623
02:47:03,530 --> 02:47:04,410
Bone-zo!

3624
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:09,150
I am gonna save real quick.

3625
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:13,550
Since I forgot to do so before.

3626
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:19,270
I'd love to reload during that battle.

3627
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:19,970
Ow, ow, ow!

3628
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:24,790
And also...

3629
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:26,750
Reveal invisible.

3630
02:47:27,990 --> 02:47:29,650
Torn scroll with magical equipment.

3631
02:47:29,730 --> 02:47:30,690
Equations and notes.

3632
02:47:30,770 --> 02:47:31,310
So that's...

3633
02:47:31,310 --> 02:47:34,410
The one at the bottom is the one that is inside the guy.

3634
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:36,490
That we're gonna have to shoot up, maybe.

3635
02:47:36,810 --> 02:47:37,530
This enchantment...

3636
02:47:37,530 --> 02:47:39,210
The invisible is rendered visible.

3637
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:42,430
Use it wisely for some things are invisible for a reason.

3638
02:47:43,090 --> 02:47:45,290
Immortal kind are not meant to see them.

3639
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:49,290
That's exciting.

3640
02:47:49,550 --> 02:47:50,050
That's kinda...

3641
02:47:50,050 --> 02:47:50,750
That's kinda fun.

3642
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:52,990
I can't believe they turned on me, though!

3643
02:47:54,850 --> 02:47:56,210
I missed my old weapon.

3644
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:04,160
What?

3645
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:05,960
Why does it say zero?

3646
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,700
Am I out of ammo?

3647
02:48:07,860 --> 02:48:09,720
Read the autopsies out this chapter?

3648
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:10,400
Voiced?

3649
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:13,000
Wait, what do you mean?

3650
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:21,950
It needs to reload.

3651
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:23,290
Wait, how do I reload it?

3652
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:25,930
Oh!

3653
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:30,550
Oh my god.

3654
02:48:30,670 --> 02:48:32,850
The way you hold stuff is just...

3655
02:48:32,850 --> 02:48:34,370
Oh gosh!

3656
02:48:34,590 --> 02:48:35,290
There's only...

3657
02:48:36,070 --> 02:48:36,950
Oh my god.

3658
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:40,380
Oh my god.

3659
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:40,600
Oh my god.

3660
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:41,740
Oh my god.

3661
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:43,100
RELOAD!

3662
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:45,200
RELOAD!

3663
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:46,300
RELOAD!

3664
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:47,340
RELOAD!

3665
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:50,120
Oh, this is so...

3666
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,820
This is so...

3667
02:48:58,220 --> 02:48:58,660
RELOAD!

3668
02:48:59,280 --> 02:48:59,720
Oh...

3669
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:00,300
Oh gosh.

3670
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:01,920
Looks like kinda...

3671
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:02,360
Oh my gosh.

3672
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:02,580
No!

3673
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:04,180
The main is attacking me!

3674
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,580
I'll chill.

3675
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:10,420
I'll chill.

3676
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:10,920
Oh gosh.

3677
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,260
Oh gosh.

3678
02:49:11,320 --> 02:49:11,760
My controls!

3679
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,220
My controls!

3680
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:12,840
Please!

3681
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:13,220
Please!

3682
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:13,820
Please!

3683
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:14,720
Please!

3684
02:49:18,980 --> 02:49:20,300
This guy seems kinda scared.

3685
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:21,180
I'm not gonna let him die.

3686
02:49:21,400 --> 02:49:21,680
Wait.

3687
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:22,600
I'm gonna go back in here?

3688
02:49:23,560 --> 02:49:25,380
And I'm actually going to, um...

3689
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:27,320
Do this spell?

3690
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:31,900
And we're gonna reload?

3691
02:49:35,860 --> 02:49:36,640
Oh, encha...

3692
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:37,740
Wait, I can enchant it?

3693
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:47,820
But I should do...

3694
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:48,600
Maybe green?

3695
02:49:48,980 --> 02:49:49,260
Oh!

3696
02:49:53,280 --> 02:49:54,040
Maybe green?

3697
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:54,420
Maybe green?

3698
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:54,520
Oh!

3699
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:56,080
I have toti...

3700
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:56,340
Um...

3701
02:49:56,340 --> 02:49:57,580
Spell list...

3702
02:49:58,920 --> 02:49:59,580
All right.

3703
02:49:59,720 --> 02:50:00,540
Spell list...

3704
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:02,300
Cast...

3705
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:03,060
Green?

3706
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:08,520
Want red?

3707
02:50:08,620 --> 02:50:08,780
Yeah.

3708
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:09,720
But we don't have red.

3709
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:10,820
So this is all I've got.

3710
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:15,020
I know I want red, but I don't have red, so I have to use what I've got.

3711
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:16,960
Oh my god.

3712
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:17,300
Please.

3713
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:20,860
Holy shit.

3714
02:50:24,280 --> 02:50:24,940
Oh my god.

3715
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:26,220
Oh my god.

3716
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:26,440
Oh my god!

3717
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:27,120
I'm in trouble!

3718
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:27,920
I'm in trouble!

3719
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:28,660
I'M IN TROUBLE!

3720
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:38,620
What are you...?

3721
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:38,900
What?

3722
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:39,800
Sir.

3723
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:45,300
This is a great star.

3724
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:47,360
This is such a great star.

3725
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,700
This is just a wonderful star.

3726
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:54,720
This is just really great.

3727
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:56,480
I'm trapped in here!

3728
02:50:58,280 --> 02:50:59,620
They're all camping!

3729
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:09,470
I think I have to use my sword.

3730
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:10,330
I don't know.

3731
02:51:16,690 --> 02:51:19,650
No, there's no way to loop around.

3732
02:51:20,050 --> 02:51:20,810
We're just gonna...

3733
02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:21,450
If I die?

3734
02:51:21,650 --> 02:51:22,110
I die.

3735
02:51:23,250 --> 02:51:23,790
Oh my god.

3736
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:24,370
Oh!

3737
02:51:24,470 --> 02:51:25,210
I'm so sorry!

3738
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:25,810
No!

3739
02:51:25,950 --> 02:51:26,250
Mister!

3740
02:51:34,890 --> 02:51:36,210
I'm so both.

3741
02:51:36,430 --> 02:51:37,010
This is so...

3742
02:51:43,650 --> 02:51:44,590
I'm so bone.

3743
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:51,980
I'm so bone.

3744
02:51:51,980 --> 02:51:54,440
Can you imagine trying to do this with one life?

3745
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:01,770
Goofy at camera angles.

3746
02:52:02,010 --> 02:52:02,330
I know!

3747
02:52:03,470 --> 02:52:04,990
That was so bad.

3748
02:52:05,330 --> 02:52:06,010
That was so bad.

3749
02:52:08,470 --> 02:52:10,290
The bone thieves are nasty.

3750
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:10,850
They are.

3751
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:12,190
I hate those guys the most.

3752
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:14,170
I don't like them.

3753
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:14,970
Good thing I saved.

3754
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:19,190
The darkness comes!

3755
02:52:20,490 --> 02:52:22,430
One life, one mint was only a dream.

3756
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:28,850
Okay.

3757
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:30,770
Alright.

3758
02:52:34,830 --> 02:52:35,290
Okay.

3759
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:53,000
I don't know which one's better.

3760
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:53,980
I'm just gonna go with green.

3761
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:57,060
Enter by...

3762
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:58,140
Selatan.

3763
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:04,420
They bl... They spam their insanity...

3764
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:05,140
I know, right?

3765
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:08,640
They spam the insanity blasts and they're so annoying and...

3766
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:11,860
Icky, icky.

3767
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:14,780
You consent, Selatan.

3768
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:17,140
I picked green because it's my favorite.

3769
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:18,320
That's what I did!

3770
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:21,720
That's what I did!

3771
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:26,180
Though I probably would always pick green.

3772
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:26,840
I'm not gonna lie.

3773
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:27,520
Okay.

3774
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:28,640
Okay.

3775
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:37,240
If I enchant my sword too...

3776
02:53:39,660 --> 02:53:42,340
So just in case I need to take it out...

3777
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:43,600
Enter by...

3778
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:44,660
Selatan.

3779
02:53:53,580 --> 02:53:55,280
It's hard though.

3780
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:56,980
Oh my gosh.

3781
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:59,000
This guy's cowering.

3782
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:03,680
Weeee!

3783
02:54:08,310 --> 02:54:09,190
And then the maid.

3784
02:54:10,650 --> 02:54:11,290
Oh my god.

3785
02:54:11,450 --> 02:54:13,570
I only got to reload.

3786
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:13,990
Oh my gosh.

3787
02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:14,250
Please.

3788
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:19,470
Reload.

3789
02:54:19,750 --> 02:54:20,770
Maybe I have time now.

3790
02:54:21,810 --> 02:54:22,250
Okay.

3791
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:28,340
Nice!

3792
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:28,960
You took it out!

3793
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:31,100
I'm posing.

3794
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:33,520
Yippee!

3795
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:35,780
No...

3796
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:35,940
You took it out.

3797
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:36,240
Okay.

3798
02:54:41,940 --> 02:54:43,140
Thank you.

3799
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:46,240
I just discovered the invisible spell.

3800
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:49,000
Is the maid... is she... good?

3801
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:50,900
Is she...

3802
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:52,600
How are you?

3803
02:54:53,020 --> 02:54:54,900
Oh, you're... oh... what?

3804
02:54:56,220 --> 02:54:56,720
Excuse me?

3805
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:57,820
You're just...

3806
02:54:58,380 --> 02:55:03,700
Eyes wide with fright, his head twists frantically left and right as if trying to see some invisible horror stalking him.

3807
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:04,740
Have you no eyes?

3808
02:55:05,060 --> 02:55:05,940
Can't you see it?

3809
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:06,380
He cries.

3810
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:10,600
Why are you cleaning the floor then?

3811
02:55:14,340 --> 02:55:15,380
Business as usual.

3812
02:55:16,140 --> 02:55:17,080
Oh, I can't sit here.

3813
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:18,860
I am gonna go back into the room though.

3814
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:23,580
That we came from and save so that we don't have to do that all over again.

3815
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:26,380
Since it was pretty clean the way we took care of it.

3816
02:55:28,660 --> 02:55:29,620
Save, save, save.

3817
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:33,680
Cast the invisible spell.

3818
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:35,980
Yes.

3819
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:40,020
Alright.

3820
02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:41,060
Where are you, buddy?

3821
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:42,200
Come here.

3822
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:43,940
I'm gonna save you.

3823
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:48,080
Wait, but it's reveal invisible.

3824
02:55:53,230 --> 02:55:53,950
Wait, which one?

3825
02:55:57,330 --> 02:55:57,730
Woah.

3826
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:05,540
Is my maid okay?

3827
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:06,240
I can't tell.

3828
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:07,860
I don't wanna go too close to her.

3829
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:08,220
I'm scared.

3830
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:14,660
But I know this door over here.

3831
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:16,300
Oh.

3832
02:56:20,580 --> 02:56:21,540
Or not.

3833
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:28,660
Am I...

3834
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:30,020
Are my bullets reloaded?

3835
02:56:30,020 --> 02:56:30,520
I can't tell.

3836
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:32,620
I guess so.

3837
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:35,600
Cast it in front of the symbol.

3838
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:47,200
HeroCon record seven times.

3839
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:51,020
Hmm.

3840
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:55,020
Oh.

3841
02:57:05,570 --> 02:57:06,130
So...

3842
02:57:06,790 --> 02:57:07,350
Green?

3843
02:57:07,570 --> 02:57:09,490
Okay, I wonder if it's the same as the...

3844
02:57:10,090 --> 02:57:13,390
I wish I could see the camera so...

3845
02:57:13,390 --> 02:57:15,470
I wonder if it's the same as the fireplace?

3846
02:57:17,010 --> 02:57:17,690
Uh oh.

3847
02:57:17,950 --> 02:57:18,710
Uh oh.

3848
02:57:18,770 --> 02:57:19,450
Uh oh.

3849
02:57:19,550 --> 02:57:20,010
No!

3850
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:22,790
No, maid!

3851
02:57:23,550 --> 02:57:24,110
No!

3852
02:57:24,710 --> 02:57:25,270
No, maid!

3853
02:57:25,270 --> 02:57:26,310
Oh, shoot.

3854
02:57:27,530 --> 02:57:27,990
What?

3855
02:57:28,050 --> 02:57:28,650
I thought I...

3856
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:31,290
Oh, shoot.

3857
02:57:31,530 --> 02:57:33,630
I only have one bullet at a time.

3858
02:57:33,690 --> 02:57:33,950
Hello?

3859
02:57:35,390 --> 02:57:36,650
Stop punching me!

3860
02:57:39,050 --> 02:57:39,510
Reload!

3861
02:57:41,430 --> 02:57:42,170
Oh, shit.

3862
02:57:42,350 --> 02:57:43,290
Oh, gosh.

3863
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:43,830
I hate...

3864
02:57:43,830 --> 02:57:45,850
I hate these creatures so...

3865
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:46,730
Much!

3866
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:53,940
Why can't I only do one bullet at a time now?

3867
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:55,560
Oh my gosh.

3868
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:56,120
Oh.

3869
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:57,720
Don't these guys...

3870
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:00,820
Dodge these things?

3871
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:01,840
Don't they dodge...

3872
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:02,100
Hold on.

3873
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:03,620
I think they...

3874
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:05,340
Equip.

3875
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:07,860
I'm

3876
02:58:11,240 --> 02:58:11,360
out!

3877
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:12,280
Nice.

3878
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:20,230
Yeah, the bone thieves dodge and stuff.

3879
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:21,870
Okay, well our maid...

3880
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:23,090
Was so sad.

3881
02:58:24,650 --> 02:58:26,330
That was the most sad thing ever.

3882
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:31,140
There we go.

3883
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:31,920
Hahaha.

3884
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:34,620
He just kicked me.

3885
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:34,920
He kicked me.

3886
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:38,000
What's this guy...

3887
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:38,900
Maximilian...

3888
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:41,040
Maximilian means business.

3889
02:58:41,320 --> 02:58:41,480
Okay?

3890
02:58:45,640 --> 02:58:46,840
Enter by...

3891
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:48,160
Celadon.

3892
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:50,420
He means business, baby.

3893
02:58:51,160 --> 02:58:51,880
Oh, yeah.

3894
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:52,640
Let's also...

3895
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:54,160
You are sent.

3896
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:55,640
Celadon.

3897
02:58:58,400 --> 02:58:59,360
You are sent.

3898
02:58:59,360 --> 02:58:59,840
Look at him.

3899
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:00,840
Look at his stance.

3900
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:04,400
Look at him just...

3901
02:59:04,400 --> 02:59:04,600
He keeps...

3902
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:10,020
He's like... Even if I was one of the bone thieves, I'd be like, I'm not messing with that guy.

3903
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:12,300
He's insane.

3904
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:14,460
He's dual wielding.

3905
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:20,700
I stopped buying books at yard sales.

3906
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:24,980
Alright, I know probably doing that is whatever.

3907
02:59:25,580 --> 02:59:27,240
But I like to just have it.

3908
02:59:28,480 --> 02:59:30,200
Okay, he said something upstairs.

3909
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:34,960
There's probably guys wandering now.

3910
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:44,680
It was my gun that's making it glow.

3911
02:59:45,380 --> 02:59:47,040
I was like, why is it glowing?

3912
02:59:47,080 --> 02:59:48,120
That's so mysterious.

3913
02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:49,240
Here!

3914
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,480
You guys...

3915
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:08,040
I don't want to tell you what I just read that word as instead of excitement.

3916
03:00:22,930 --> 03:00:25,490
The music is literally me reading it.

3917
03:00:28,350 --> 03:00:32,630
Despite his excitement at the discovery, Max senses something odd about it.

3918
03:00:32,690 --> 03:00:34,430
A sense of evil.

3919
03:00:36,870 --> 03:00:37,590
But they...

3920
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:40,190
Oh my god.

3921
03:00:48,550 --> 03:00:49,250
Finish him.

3922
03:00:50,570 --> 03:00:52,270
Dang, this thing takes those out.

3923
03:00:52,350 --> 03:00:52,630
Nice.

3924
03:00:54,070 --> 03:00:57,090
Oh no, that's why they replaced the painting probably.

3925
03:00:57,790 --> 03:00:58,810
Or the...

3926
03:01:00,710 --> 03:01:01,410
What's it called?

3927
03:01:01,550 --> 03:01:02,350
Not painting.

3928
03:01:03,050 --> 03:01:03,830
Stained glass.

3929
03:01:04,930 --> 03:01:06,070
That's why it's different.

3930
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:10,630
Why is it...

3931
03:01:12,930 --> 03:01:17,070
I appreciate that this guy's finishing move is essentially whacking it with his cane.

3932
03:01:17,250 --> 03:01:18,470
And kicking them in the ribs.

3933
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:19,290
Classy.

3934
03:01:22,790 --> 03:01:23,290
Okay.

3935
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:24,410
Oh, wait.

3936
03:01:24,470 --> 03:01:24,810
Our letter.

3937
03:01:26,190 --> 03:01:28,770
A paper envelope sealed with a glob of melted wax.

3938
03:01:29,010 --> 03:01:31,050
An odd rune is pressed into the wax.

3939
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:33,170
There appears to be something heavy inside.

3940
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:40,510
Inside the envelope is a letter addressed to one of Max's father's aides.

3941
03:01:42,150 --> 03:01:43,310
And a basement key.

3942
03:01:45,810 --> 03:01:46,830
Where's the basement?

3943
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:50,090
Where's the basement?

3944
03:01:51,930 --> 03:01:52,410
Um...

3945
03:01:52,410 --> 03:01:55,270
The letter written in a scrawling hand reads, Dear friend.

3946
03:01:55,470 --> 03:01:58,170
As I expected, the beasts are drawing closer to our discovery.

3947
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:00,390
They want the book for themselves, it seems.

3948
03:02:00,550 --> 03:02:02,310
And do not want us to have it in our possession.

3949
03:02:02,690 --> 03:02:07,910
I've taken steps to ensure that our ilk will not touch the key in this envelope.

3950
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:10,070
Should you fall prey to their claws.

3951
03:02:10,530 --> 03:02:14,850
The envelope containing the basement key has been sealed with a corrosive magic.

3952
03:02:15,290 --> 03:02:18,890
If one not aligned to us tries to handle it, it will be released...

3953
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:23,770
It will be released, inflicting pain, suffering, and a grievous blow to their sanity.

3954
03:02:23,970 --> 03:02:27,110
Should they have any left, be swept with your task.

3955
03:02:27,390 --> 03:02:28,190
A.R.

3956
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:32,750
Alrighty.

3957
03:02:34,310 --> 03:02:34,910
Um...

3958
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:41,300
Downstairs?

3959
03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:50,610
What's happening?

3960
03:02:52,950 --> 03:02:53,930
My sanity?

3961
03:02:53,930 --> 03:02:54,390
Oh!

3962
03:02:57,630 --> 03:02:58,350
Another guy!

3963
03:02:58,570 --> 03:02:59,190
Are you kidding me?

3964
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:08,180
Wait, is it still enchanted?

3965
03:03:08,260 --> 03:03:08,620
I can't tell.

3966
03:03:08,740 --> 03:03:09,180
Oh my god.

3967
03:03:11,280 --> 03:03:13,480
My... yes, they are still enchanted.

3968
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:15,740
Yeah, look at that.

3969
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:17,180
Okay.

3970
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:19,520
I'm trying to get his eye.

3971
03:03:21,100 --> 03:03:21,700
Oh shit!

3972
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:26,380
I can't... I can only...

3973
03:03:27,280 --> 03:03:27,640
Okay.

3974
03:03:27,640 --> 03:03:27,900
Come on.

3975
03:03:29,770 --> 03:03:30,290
Come on.

3976
03:03:37,550 --> 03:03:38,630
Not the best place, maybe.

3977
03:03:39,610 --> 03:03:40,590
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

3978
03:03:40,810 --> 03:03:41,670
Go, go, go, go, go.

3979
03:03:42,170 --> 03:03:43,630
Ouch, ouch.

3980
03:03:46,330 --> 03:03:46,810
Oh my god.

3981
03:03:46,830 --> 03:03:47,770
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3982
03:03:48,710 --> 03:03:50,110
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3983
03:03:50,550 --> 03:03:51,410
Go upstairs, maybe?

3984
03:03:54,210 --> 03:03:55,510
He's just chasing after me!

3985
03:03:59,070 --> 03:04:00,170
Not even a moment's rest?

3986
03:04:01,530 --> 03:04:02,210
Okay, this is good.

3987
03:04:02,510 --> 03:04:02,790
Actually.

3988
03:04:03,530 --> 03:04:03,810
Here.

3989
03:04:04,210 --> 03:04:04,490
Okay.

3990
03:04:05,330 --> 03:04:05,810
Oh,

3991
03:04:11,590 --> 03:04:11,810
whoa.

3992
03:04:11,950 --> 03:04:12,650
Oh gosh.

3993
03:04:12,930 --> 03:04:14,170
He gets me every time.

3994
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:20,790
That's just like a big...

3995
03:04:21,370 --> 03:04:22,030
There we go.

3996
03:04:29,650 --> 03:04:30,870
We got a red rod!

3997
03:04:34,010 --> 03:04:34,490
Oh.

3998
03:04:35,150 --> 03:04:35,630
Maybe.

3999
03:04:38,110 --> 03:04:38,790
You okay?

4000
03:04:39,110 --> 03:04:40,210
You okay, Maximilian?

4001
03:04:40,250 --> 03:04:40,510
Elias?

4002
03:04:40,750 --> 03:04:41,270
Maximilliam?

4003
03:04:41,990 --> 03:04:42,510
Maximus?

4004
03:04:42,670 --> 03:04:43,230
What's his name?

4005
03:04:49,730 --> 03:04:51,450
I hear someone sweeping.

4006
03:04:51,710 --> 03:04:52,610
Okay, I think it's our guy.

4007
03:04:55,330 --> 03:04:57,430
I can't... I don't know why he's still normal.

4008
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:07,940
Wait, will this help?

4009
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:09,300
Absorb...

4010
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:14,120
Recover spell!

4011
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:18,380
We can now heal!

4012
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:21,240
I think.

4013
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:25,900
Recover?

4014
03:05:26,380 --> 03:05:26,940
Nope.

4015
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:27,820
Assign?

4016
03:05:28,540 --> 03:05:29,820
Red to here.

4017
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:33,480
New autopsy time?

4018
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,700
But where?

4019
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:38,980
Oh wait, actually, what if I do the spell of Reveal Invisible?

4020
03:05:40,320 --> 03:05:44,520
Will we see the guy that we just killed?

4021
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:46,580
Will we see him?

4022
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:51,580
Oh, I thought that was it.

4023
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:51,940
Nope.

4024
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:52,960
Dang.

4025
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:54,680
I tried.

4026
03:05:56,880 --> 03:05:57,460
Okay.

4027
03:05:58,600 --> 03:05:59,780
Spell list...

4028
03:06:00,500 --> 03:06:01,840
Reveal Invisible...

4029
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:05,280
No, new spell...

4030
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:06,540
Red...

4031
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:08,720
Area...

4032
03:06:09,900 --> 03:06:10,500
Project?

4033
03:06:12,960 --> 03:06:13,820
Is that it?

4034
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:17,180
Nezumi!

4035
03:06:17,460 --> 03:06:18,360
Welcome to membership!

4036
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:18,900
Thank you!

4037
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:22,580
I will always...

4038
03:06:22,580 --> 03:06:22,920
Spend...

4039
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:23,560
Spectacle!

4040
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:26,540
It's me!

4041
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:27,580
Spell nine, baby!

4042
03:06:29,610 --> 03:06:31,940
Why does it feel like an action game all of a sudden?

4043
03:06:35,280 --> 03:06:38,640
Oh wait, spell nine...

4044
03:06:40,970 --> 03:06:41,540
Okay, hold on.

4045
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:42,580
Spellist...

4046
03:06:42,580 --> 03:06:44,420
Reveal Invisible, check.

4047
03:06:45,270 --> 03:06:46,240
It was, uh...

4048
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:48,920
Narakoth and Red Gormur!

4049
03:06:50,440 --> 03:06:51,300
It was Gormur.

4050
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:52,180
It was Gormur.

4051
03:06:53,140 --> 03:06:54,500
Narakoth and Red Gorm War.

4052
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:57,180
Narakoth... Narakoth and...

4053
03:07:02,360 --> 03:07:03,760
You don't need to redo spells.

4054
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:04,360
It's automatic.

4055
03:07:04,700 --> 03:07:05,320
What do you mean redo?

4056
03:07:05,420 --> 03:07:06,000
Oh, wait.

4057
03:07:06,080 --> 03:07:06,700
What do you mean redo?

4058
03:07:08,680 --> 03:07:09,120
Yay!

4059
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:11,260
Ghost made Mei cry.

4060
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:14,780
Good evening Minto!

4061
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:15,920
How am I feeling?

4062
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:16,500
I'm alright.

4063
03:07:16,660 --> 03:07:17,640
I'm a little sleepy actually.

4064
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:26,520
Recover enchant item.

4065
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:28,480
Hold on.

4066
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:29,520
I'm checking everything though.

4067
03:07:30,820 --> 03:07:33,300
Anterbork and Magor Mawr.

4068
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:34,240
Anterbork...

4069
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:39,800
Anterbork and Magor Mawr.

4070
03:07:40,300 --> 03:07:40,940
There.

4071
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:44,060
There we go.

4072
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:45,640
Okay.

4073
03:07:46,480 --> 03:07:49,700
Now we can cast our things to be red as well.

4074
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:50,760
Our items.

4075
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:54,560
And we can heal.

4076
03:07:54,940 --> 03:07:55,680
We're good.

4077
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:05,900
The color existing spells stay and have all colors as you unlock them.

4078
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:07,880
You don't need to recreate the same spells each time.

4079
03:08:08,280 --> 03:08:08,880
Oh, wait.

4080
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:09,420
Actually...

4081
03:08:26,410 --> 03:08:26,930
Reveal.

4082
03:08:30,290 --> 03:08:31,490
Recover enchant item.

4083
03:08:39,310 --> 03:08:40,810
I want to check though.

4084
03:08:41,030 --> 03:08:44,670
I did the green one earlier because I thought maybe we could do it...

4085
03:08:44,670 --> 03:08:48,530
Because we went to the Sephia world, I thought maybe he was invisible.

4086
03:08:48,790 --> 03:08:49,830
And we'd be able to go there.

4087
03:08:50,470 --> 03:08:51,310
Oh, it's locked.

4088
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:51,710
Wait!

4089
03:08:51,830 --> 03:08:52,790
The basement key.

4090
03:09:00,050 --> 03:09:01,530
God, these camera angles.

4091
03:09:01,910 --> 03:09:02,390
They're...

4092
03:09:03,570 --> 03:09:04,050
Oh!

4093
03:09:06,970 --> 03:09:09,250
They're very Resident Evil and they scare me.

4094
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:11,450
Wait.

4095
03:09:11,630 --> 03:09:13,610
I'm gonna equip the saber.

4096
03:09:14,330 --> 03:09:15,850
I'm going to spell.

4097
03:09:17,070 --> 03:09:17,590
Enchant.

4098
03:09:18,050 --> 03:09:18,570
Cast.

4099
03:09:19,270 --> 03:09:20,230
On the saber.

4100
03:09:25,050 --> 03:09:25,570
Yippee!

4101
03:09:25,770 --> 03:09:27,370
And then I'm going to...

4102
03:09:28,870 --> 03:09:29,390
Oh.

4103
03:09:29,390 --> 03:09:30,130
Oh my god.

4104
03:09:31,330 --> 03:09:31,850
Oh

4105
03:09:36,200 --> 03:09:36,800
my god.

4106
03:09:36,820 --> 03:09:37,480
No, it's this...

4107
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:38,560
No, please.

4108
03:09:39,500 --> 03:09:40,260
Oh my god.

4109
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:40,820
I can't.

4110
03:09:40,820 --> 03:09:41,280
I can't fight.

4111
03:09:41,420 --> 03:09:42,080
I can't.

4112
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:42,160
I can't fight.

4113
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:43,880
I can't.

4114
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:44,660
I can't.

4115
03:09:47,320 --> 03:09:48,040
There we go.

4116
03:09:48,380 --> 03:09:49,040
Finish him.

4117
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:51,320
Yeah.

4118
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:51,700
Kick him.

4119
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:53,280
Okay.

4120
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:54,380
And...

4121
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:55,680
Yeah.

4122
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:56,360
Fight him.

4123
03:09:56,820 --> 03:09:57,420
Kill him.

4124
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:02,370
Very Resident Evil.

4125
03:10:07,550 --> 03:10:08,510
Camera angles.

4126
03:10:10,090 --> 03:10:10,690
Finish him.

4127
03:10:11,930 --> 03:10:12,430
Nice.

4128
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:13,150
Yeah.

4129
03:10:13,270 --> 03:10:13,790
Take him out.

4130
03:10:13,890 --> 03:10:14,330
Take him out.

4131
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:17,730
Is this one my sanity?

4132
03:10:21,310 --> 03:10:22,310
Oh no.

4133
03:10:23,230 --> 03:10:23,730
This...

4134
03:10:26,350 --> 03:10:27,590
This one's my sanity.

4135
03:10:30,250 --> 03:10:31,510
There we go.

4136
03:10:31,650 --> 03:10:33,050
We're not slightly tilted anymore.

4137
03:10:35,130 --> 03:10:35,630
Okay.

4138
03:10:36,350 --> 03:10:37,350
We're in the basement.

4139
03:10:38,470 --> 03:10:39,070
Oh.

4140
03:10:39,570 --> 03:10:40,190
What's that?

4141
03:10:40,770 --> 03:10:41,690
Dirty water.

4142
03:10:43,170 --> 03:10:44,210
Scroll of paper.

4143
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:44,510
Oh.

4144
03:10:46,310 --> 03:10:47,170
Damage field.

4145
03:10:48,690 --> 03:10:50,590
Is that the one I cast earlier?

4146
03:10:50,830 --> 03:10:51,610
Or did earlier?

4147
03:10:52,810 --> 03:10:53,410
No.

4148
03:10:53,730 --> 03:10:55,010
What is spell nine?

4149
03:10:58,170 --> 03:11:01,450
A tattered scroll lined with curious writing and diagrams.

4150
03:11:01,510 --> 03:11:06,430
It reads, this incantation exerts a force of mystical power within the confines of its runes.

4151
03:11:06,430 --> 03:11:08,770
Nothing may enter till it is dispelled.

4152
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:13,230
Try spell nine.

4153
03:11:23,190 --> 03:11:25,010
So it's just like a big...

4154
03:11:27,170 --> 03:11:28,350
It's just a big...

4155
03:11:30,230 --> 03:11:30,910
Like...

4156
03:11:32,130 --> 03:11:33,150
Spell nine.

4157
03:11:33,450 --> 03:11:35,530
N-I-N-E.

4158
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:37,230
Give me!

4159
03:11:37,490 --> 03:11:38,750
Thanks for two more hands!

4160
03:11:40,270 --> 03:11:40,750
Oh.

4161
03:11:40,790 --> 03:11:41,390
We got more rooms.

4162
03:11:45,270 --> 03:11:47,490
I think I'm gonna rearrange my quick...

4163
03:11:48,310 --> 03:11:48,790
Oh.

4164
03:11:48,890 --> 03:11:49,490
What did I...

4165
03:11:49,490 --> 03:11:49,910
What did I...

4166
03:11:49,910 --> 03:11:50,590
Examine what?

4167
03:11:51,410 --> 03:11:51,890
Oh.

4168
03:11:51,950 --> 03:11:52,730
Examine what?

4169
03:11:52,910 --> 03:11:53,110
Oh.

4170
03:11:53,130 --> 03:11:53,250
There.

4171
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:55,050
The pump!

4172
03:11:58,030 --> 03:11:59,250
We got the pump though.

4173
03:11:59,510 --> 03:12:00,850
Was there anything over here?

4174
03:12:02,270 --> 03:12:03,070
Just checking.

4175
03:12:10,610 --> 03:12:12,130
All right.

4176
03:12:12,370 --> 03:12:13,750
All right guys.

4177
03:12:15,390 --> 03:12:16,430
My pump.

4178
03:12:20,630 --> 03:12:21,650
Oh my god.

4179
03:12:21,790 --> 03:12:23,310
It's so ghastly.

4180
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:24,170
It's ghostly.

4181
03:12:24,250 --> 03:12:25,490
The pump's all by itself.

4182
03:12:26,770 --> 03:12:30,050
Good morning, thanks to the three birds!

4183
03:12:31,290 --> 03:12:32,350
That pump?

4184
03:12:32,750 --> 03:12:35,570
Come on, baby America!

4185
03:12:35,870 --> 03:12:36,410
Oh.

4186
03:12:46,610 --> 03:12:47,350
Spell nine.

4187
03:12:51,850 --> 03:12:52,370
Oh.

4188
03:12:52,370 --> 03:12:52,890
Oh.

4189
03:12:52,890 --> 03:12:53,230
No!

4190
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:53,710
Oh.

4191
03:12:53,850 --> 03:12:54,070
Oh.

4192
03:12:56,810 --> 03:12:58,050
I messed up.

4193
03:12:58,470 --> 03:13:00,570
I forgot that I need to stay in the circle.

4194
03:13:03,730 --> 03:13:04,770
I forgot.

4195
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:05,570
I forgot.

4196
03:13:05,970 --> 03:13:06,670
Bye bye.

4197
03:13:09,050 --> 03:13:10,010
Damage fields!

4198
03:13:11,770 --> 03:13:12,410
Yay!

4199
03:13:16,230 --> 03:13:17,230
What's this guy?

4200
03:13:18,030 --> 03:13:18,670
Disgusting.

4201
03:13:21,710 --> 03:13:22,350
Disgusting.

4202
03:13:23,810 --> 03:13:24,690
Thank you.

4203
03:13:24,850 --> 03:13:27,790
I'm gonna check the... the autopsies right now.

4204
03:13:31,210 --> 03:13:32,230
Maximilian's awesome!

4205
03:13:32,410 --> 03:13:33,110
He's so strong!

4206
03:13:35,070 --> 03:13:35,890
Let's see.

4207
03:13:37,350 --> 03:13:37,950
Wait.

4208
03:13:38,050 --> 03:13:38,830
No, I wanna check it.

4209
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:40,750
Oh, it's in the...

4210
03:13:40,750 --> 03:13:41,770
Check.

4211
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:49,980
Oh, here it is.

4212
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:50,540
Autopsy.

4213
03:13:53,440 --> 03:13:55,280
Analysis of Mantorok Zombie.

4214
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:57,160
A living human corpse.

4215
03:13:57,340 --> 03:13:59,220
It has no special attributes or weaknesses.

4216
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:02,260
No special attributes?

4217
03:14:02,560 --> 03:14:03,400
That's so sad.

4218
03:14:03,560 --> 03:14:04,480
Everybody's special.

4219
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:06,020
It is very weak.

4220
03:14:06,140 --> 03:14:08,020
Composed of dried sinew and skin.

4221
03:14:10,780 --> 03:14:11,980
Zellototh Zombie.

4222
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:16,620
Limbs regrow as phantom and...

4223
03:14:17,540 --> 03:14:18,160
Phantom?

4224
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:20,320
There's no voiceover?

4225
03:14:20,520 --> 03:14:21,580
Is there supposed to be?

4226
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:23,280
I remember there was voiceover.

4227
03:14:25,060 --> 03:14:26,780
No voiceover in this chapter.

4228
03:14:29,680 --> 03:14:30,300
Oh.

4229
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:30,920
Um...

4230
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:33,260
Yeah, my bad.

4231
03:14:33,660 --> 03:14:35,100
It's after the chapter ends.

4232
03:14:35,100 --> 03:14:35,320
Ah.

4233
03:14:36,060 --> 03:14:42,220
Limbs regrow as phantom entities when severed, causing deep-rooted insanity in the observers.

4234
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:44,560
Oh, that's why they turn... green?

4235
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:45,380
Are those boobs?

4236
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:49,780
Does this zombie have boobs?

4237
03:14:52,540 --> 03:14:53,140
Would.

4238
03:14:53,580 --> 03:14:57,020
The wrappings of the mummy are hardly combustible and catch fire easily.

4239
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:57,380
Yes!

4240
03:14:57,460 --> 03:14:58,540
Yes, we knew that.

4241
03:14:58,940 --> 03:14:59,780
Sure does.

4242
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:02,920
Zomboobs.

4243
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:10,620
I put my hands up to play my song.

4244
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:12,140
The butterflies fly away.

4245
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,960
Nodding my head like, yeah.

4246
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:17,020
Moving my...

4247
03:15:17,840 --> 03:15:20,720
Moving my wrappings like, yeah.

4248
03:15:21,180 --> 03:15:23,900
I put my hands up to play my song.

4249
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:25,600
I know I'm gonna be okay.

4250
03:15:26,460 --> 03:15:28,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4251
03:15:28,740 --> 03:15:32,320
It's a party in Zellototh's cave.

4252
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4253
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,440
It's a party in Zellototh's cave.

4254
03:15:38,760 --> 03:15:39,100
Whoa!

4255
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:42,760
Why is there...

4256
03:15:42,760 --> 03:15:43,640
Why is this...

4257
03:15:44,840 --> 03:15:46,280
In my basement?

4258
03:15:47,960 --> 03:15:50,160
Max is incredulous at the sight.

4259
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:55,800
A desolate ruin of a fantastic city built into a huge naturally formed cave.

4260
03:15:56,400 --> 03:15:59,900
Judding spires and looming buildings poke through the dense fog.

4261
03:16:00,180 --> 03:16:04,060
Light ebbs through the city, crackling in the wake of the energy.

4262
03:16:05,080 --> 03:16:08,580
Spelling from a light source held aloft by unseen forces.

4263
03:16:14,190 --> 03:16:15,090
JPEG city.

4264
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:17,190
I love the PNG.

4265
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:20,470
Long,

4266
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:34,620
long staircase.

4267
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:37,340
Ooh, it's really dark down there.

4268
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:39,400
Like an inter...

4269
03:16:39,400 --> 03:16:39,920
Oh.

4270
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:44,300
Maximilian coming in here like, I'm about to mess up this town!

4271
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:49,060
Oh, what is that?

4272
03:17:10,330 --> 03:17:10,930
Unfazed.

4273
03:17:18,020 --> 03:17:19,440
What if I do one too?

4274
03:17:20,440 --> 03:17:21,040
Wait.

4275
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:30,080
Oh no!

4276
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:36,380
Mine didn't reach long enough!

4277
03:17:38,360 --> 03:17:38,960
Save?

4278
03:17:39,280 --> 03:17:39,820
Oh.

4279
03:17:41,260 --> 03:17:41,860
Um.

4280
03:17:42,320 --> 03:17:42,920
Oh.

4281
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:42,960
Oh.

4282
03:17:42,960 --> 03:17:42,980
Oh.

4283
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:46,640
It did hit!

4284
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:47,120
Oh, it did?

4285
03:17:49,680 --> 03:17:51,200
I don't think I can save though.

4286
03:17:51,380 --> 03:17:52,120
It won't let me.

4287
03:17:53,120 --> 03:17:53,360
Um.

4288
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:57,440
I think we're just gonna have to...

4289
03:17:58,400 --> 03:17:58,840
Uh.

4290
03:18:01,880 --> 03:18:02,320
Yeah.

4291
03:18:04,900 --> 03:18:05,920
A flinch and go...

4292
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:07,040
Okay, so it did glow red.

4293
03:18:07,480 --> 03:18:08,360
Okay, um.

4294
03:18:11,760 --> 03:18:12,200
Uh.

4295
03:18:12,420 --> 03:18:13,120
What was I gonna say?

4296
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:13,520
When did I...

4297
03:18:13,520 --> 03:18:14,580
When was the last time I saved?

4298
03:18:16,100 --> 03:18:17,960
I think it was before I went into the basement.

4299
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:19,380
So it wasn't that long ago.

4300
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:22,320
I don't think it'll let me in here.

4301
03:18:23,960 --> 03:18:24,920
Can I just go?

4302
03:18:25,180 --> 03:18:25,960
Can I attack him?

4303
03:18:26,140 --> 03:18:28,560
In fact, I'm just gonna enchant my sword.

4304
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:33,060
Every time I have to go into this...

4305
03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:35,740
Oh my gosh.

4306
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:36,920
Oh.

4307
03:18:40,080 --> 03:18:40,740
Thank you.

4308
03:18:48,050 --> 03:18:48,690
Oh, there it is.

4309
03:18:48,810 --> 03:18:49,330
Thank you.

4310
03:18:49,330 --> 03:18:49,490
Thank you.

4311
03:18:49,530 --> 03:18:49,590
There it is.

4312
03:18:50,250 --> 03:18:50,490
There it is.

4313
03:18:50,490 --> 03:18:51,110
I got this, too.

4314
03:18:56,130 --> 03:18:57,430
What's all this stuff?

4315
03:18:57,470 --> 03:18:57,730
If you have the right ones...

4316
03:18:57,730 --> 03:18:57,770
You can...

4317
03:18:57,770 --> 03:18:58,430
...you can...

4318
03:19:04,490 --> 03:19:06,710
If you have the right ones...

4319
03:19:06,710 --> 03:19:07,330
Yeah, you can...

4320
03:19:07,330 --> 03:19:08,030
...you can...

4321
03:19:08,030 --> 03:19:09,370
I mean, no, if someone has the right ones...

4322
03:19:09,370 --> 03:19:09,670
...you can do whatever you want with them.

4323
03:19:09,870 --> 03:19:10,250
Good job.

4324
03:19:10,250 --> 03:19:11,030
Oh, no.

4325
03:19:16,030 --> 03:19:17,070
It's okay!

4326
03:19:17,250 --> 03:19:17,310
It's okay.

4327
03:19:17,310 --> 03:19:17,430
Yeah.

4328
03:19:17,470 --> 03:19:17,890
I can't do anything.

4329
03:19:18,330 --> 03:19:25,690
Maybe I can do something.

4330
03:19:30,970 --> 03:19:33,330
What's it doing?

4331
03:19:36,110 --> 03:19:37,370
Oh, it's summoning.

4332
03:19:38,390 --> 03:19:39,470
It's summoning guys.

4333
03:19:45,440 --> 03:19:47,200
Where are you going?

4334
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:47,220
Where are you going?

4335
03:19:50,220 --> 03:19:51,360
I killed your guy.

4336
03:19:56,340 --> 03:19:56,860
Nice.

4337
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:00,160
Oh.

4338
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:03,120
Nice.

4339
03:20:08,680 --> 03:20:09,800
Oh, run closer.

4340
03:20:10,060 --> 03:20:11,020
Oh, you got him.

4341
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:11,600
I think.

4342
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:16,700
I'm speaking Latin.

4343
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:20,460
Oh, nice.

4344
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:23,860
Whoa.

4345
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:29,360
Sounded like it was something from Faith.

4346
03:20:29,620 --> 03:20:30,840
I don't need to save you guys.

4347
03:20:35,780 --> 03:20:37,460
Park on Cynthia's Park.

4348
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:39,300
The accursed beast was dead.

4349
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,940
But not without its toll on me.

4350
03:20:42,580 --> 03:20:43,780
That was but one.

4351
03:20:44,240 --> 03:20:46,340
And there was an entire city of them.

4352
03:20:46,400 --> 03:20:47,340
Oh, you're right.

4353
03:20:47,340 --> 03:20:48,900
I did not hope to fight them all alone.

4354
03:20:49,060 --> 03:20:49,500
Oh, no.

4355
03:20:49,740 --> 03:20:51,620
I knew I had to get help.

4356
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:57,280
I knew there was a way.

4357
03:20:57,760 --> 03:20:59,560
I just had to find it.

4358
03:20:59,740 --> 03:21:01,300
Can I summon my own demons?

4359
03:21:01,660 --> 03:21:03,300
Oh, three months later.

4360
03:21:05,080 --> 03:21:05,900
No way.

4361
03:21:11,850 --> 03:21:13,450
Three months later.

4362
03:21:14,130 --> 03:21:15,010
I tried.

4363
03:21:15,330 --> 03:21:16,590
I tried to tell them.

4364
03:21:16,850 --> 03:21:18,210
But they won't listen to me.

4365
03:21:18,210 --> 03:21:19,550
Damn them.

4366
03:21:19,610 --> 03:21:20,870
Damn their eyes.

4367
03:21:21,170 --> 03:21:22,050
The rats.

4368
03:21:22,250 --> 03:21:22,590
Can you believe me?

4369
03:21:22,890 --> 03:21:24,290
Strange creatures.

4370
03:21:24,710 --> 03:21:26,690
The world in power from unseen foes.

4371
03:21:26,690 --> 03:21:27,630
No, Maximus.

4372
03:21:27,990 --> 03:21:28,630
Death.

4373
03:21:29,330 --> 03:21:29,970
Darkness.

4374
03:21:32,630 --> 03:21:34,090
They left me in a room.

4375
03:21:34,110 --> 03:21:34,830
A room with rats.

4376
03:21:34,850 --> 03:21:34,870
Instead, they cheered.

4377
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:36,570
Killed me into this forsaken place.

4378
03:21:37,710 --> 03:21:41,450
A place of empty souls and fevered thoughts.

4379
03:21:42,030 --> 03:21:43,850
Reeking of fetter and decay.

4380
03:21:44,710 --> 03:21:46,910
Thinking me mad with delirium.

4381
03:21:47,550 --> 03:21:48,190
I'm not going to die.

4382
03:21:48,190 --> 03:21:53,530
The fools cast away their hopes of salvation by locking me in this damned asylum.

4383
03:21:57,270 --> 03:21:59,770
May the rats eat your eyes!

4384
03:22:00,730 --> 03:22:03,470
I am now lost to your cause!

4385
03:22:03,850 --> 03:22:05,830
The darkness comes!

4386
03:22:06,430 --> 03:22:08,870
It will damn us all!

4387
03:22:14,490 --> 03:22:16,860
May the rats eat your eyes!

4388
03:22:17,440 --> 03:22:18,100
Yeah!

4389
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:19,340
Huey.

4390
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:20,900
It's literally me.

4391
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:23,000
The darkness comes!

4392
03:22:24,340 --> 03:22:25,400
That was intense.

4393
03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:29,440
How do you feel about that, Alex?

4394
03:22:31,220 --> 03:22:32,420
That was...

4395
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:34,860
To be continued.

4396
03:22:34,980 --> 03:22:36,120
The battle is won but the war...

4397
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:38,980
The war against the darkness rages on!

4398
03:22:40,700 --> 03:22:43,260
This isn't really happening.

4399
03:22:45,240 --> 03:22:47,060
I gotta restore my sanity.

4400
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:55,180
Sanity check.

4401
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:57,720
I thought for real it was actually going to be like...

4402
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:59,060
Continue to the next game!

4403
03:23:01,540 --> 03:23:03,000
That was so awesome.

4404
03:23:06,740 --> 03:23:07,260
Cool.

4405
03:23:07,540 --> 03:23:10,020
So now we have the spell to reveal the door.

4406
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:15,000
And insert disc two, everybody.

4407
03:23:19,890 --> 03:23:20,410
Yeah.

4408
03:23:20,450 --> 03:23:21,430
Eternal darkness two.

4409
03:23:21,610 --> 03:23:22,130
Oh.

4410
03:23:22,130 --> 03:23:22,250
That was...

4411
03:23:22,810 --> 03:23:23,690
Never happened.

4412
03:23:25,910 --> 03:23:26,530
Wasn't it...

4413
03:23:26,530 --> 03:23:30,730
Wasn't it like there was a spiritual successor and then like that had to get cancelled or something?

4414
03:23:31,250 --> 03:23:32,530
There's still this whole room.

4415
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:34,970
That...

4416
03:23:34,970 --> 03:23:36,530
I'm still not sure what to do here.

4417
03:23:37,570 --> 03:23:39,310
So we'll just ignore it for now.

4418
03:23:41,850 --> 03:23:42,290
Save.

4419
03:23:42,490 --> 03:23:43,030
Thank you.

4420
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:51,040
The dresser.

4421
03:23:51,060 --> 03:23:51,340
Yes!

4422
03:23:52,700 --> 03:23:53,580
The dresser.

4423
03:23:53,580 --> 03:23:54,980
Maybe now we can...

4424
03:23:54,980 --> 03:23:55,200
Okay.

4425
03:23:55,260 --> 03:23:55,500
So we can...

4426
03:23:55,500 --> 03:23:56,360
So we have the door.

4427
03:23:58,660 --> 03:23:59,820
We have the door.

4428
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:01,800
Down here.

4429
03:24:02,680 --> 03:24:04,100
Then we have the dresser.

4430
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:06,940
All the autopsies.

4431
03:24:07,460 --> 03:24:08,460
There's so much.

4432
03:24:08,620 --> 03:24:09,720
You guys are like, don't forget this.

4433
03:24:09,820 --> 03:24:10,580
Don't forget that.

4434
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:11,440
Minto.

4435
03:24:11,660 --> 03:24:12,040
Oh.

4436
03:24:12,140 --> 03:24:12,480
Guardians.

4437
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:13,020
Oh.

4438
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:14,900
Oh.

4439
03:24:15,380 --> 03:24:16,340
Gibbering insanity.

4440
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:20,840
Wrought in flesh as though an artist had sculpted it.

4441
03:24:21,440 --> 03:24:24,680
Created from nothing by their mistress, Zelototh.

4442
03:24:24,860 --> 03:24:25,480
A cannibal.

4443
03:24:25,500 --> 03:24:27,500
A canvas as grotesque as any.

4444
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:29,880
Their bodies made no sense.

4445
03:24:30,100 --> 03:24:30,880
No heads.

4446
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:32,020
No organs.

4447
03:24:32,500 --> 03:24:35,920
An empty husk, devoid of the trappings of nature.

4448
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:37,580
But it walked.

4449
03:24:37,820 --> 03:24:39,200
It sang.

4450
03:24:40,120 --> 03:24:41,720
It shrieked.

4451
03:24:41,940 --> 03:24:45,100
A mockery of reason, both natural and mental.

4452
03:24:45,220 --> 03:24:49,000
A blasphemy from beyond the veil.

4453
03:24:50,280 --> 03:24:52,640
The veil has opened.

4454
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:56,900
And we should not see beyond.

4455
03:24:58,400 --> 03:24:59,620
We...

4456
03:24:59,620 --> 03:25:02,840
We weren't meant to.

4457
03:25:03,410 --> 03:25:04,020
Never...

4458
03:25:04,640 --> 03:25:07,200
Ever meant to.

4459
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:12,880
Oh, give us the blessing of ignorance.

4460
03:25:13,360 --> 03:25:17,460
The happiness of oblivion.

4461
03:25:19,550 --> 03:25:21,910
Innocence can only be tainted.

4462
03:25:21,910 --> 03:25:24,750
Never returned.

4463
03:25:27,750 --> 03:25:28,930
Oh my god.

4464
03:25:30,510 --> 03:25:32,570
I couldn't even say anything through it.

4465
03:25:32,950 --> 03:25:34,890
He just sounded so awesome.

4466
03:25:36,610 --> 03:25:37,930
Ten out of ten VA.

4467
03:25:38,150 --> 03:25:38,970
Holy cow.

4468
03:25:41,110 --> 03:25:42,770
Wait, does he do this for all of them?

4469
03:25:44,730 --> 03:25:45,290
Corpses.

4470
03:25:45,950 --> 03:25:46,510
Lumbering.

4471
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:48,010
Rotting cadavers.

4472
03:25:49,170 --> 03:25:51,250
What contrivance could have wrought this?

4473
03:25:51,250 --> 03:25:51,430
This...

4474
03:25:52,200 --> 03:25:53,450
This abomination.

4475
03:25:53,930 --> 03:25:55,450
Disease science.

4476
03:25:55,970 --> 03:25:58,030
Blasphemous occult rituals.

4477
03:25:58,210 --> 03:26:06,490
How can something so, so dead yet be so alive and hungry?

4478
03:26:06,770 --> 03:26:08,450
I lust for flesh.

4479
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:09,270
Human flesh.

4480
03:26:09,270 --> 03:26:10,450
Such a lust for flesh.

4481
03:26:10,830 --> 03:26:15,610
And feast upon all the sweet breads a man has to offer.

4482
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:20,110
Wow.

4483
03:26:20,450 --> 03:26:21,310
Zombie.

4484
03:26:21,310 --> 03:26:32,130
Neither the embalming salve of their wrappings nor the numbness of death could override the dominating madness that is Zelototh.

4485
03:26:32,370 --> 03:26:32,930
Zelototh.

4486
03:26:33,110 --> 03:26:33,650
Controlled.

4487
03:26:33,990 --> 03:26:41,530
Prodded into an existence by an incessant cacophony of voices penetrating every level of their psyches.

4488
03:26:41,610 --> 03:26:44,970
These corpses are coerced into life.

4489
03:26:45,010 --> 03:26:45,830
It's like method acting.

4490
03:26:46,190 --> 03:26:46,210
Ambling.

4491
03:26:47,110 --> 03:26:47,910
Moaning.

4492
03:26:50,050 --> 03:26:50,410
Shrieking.

4493
03:26:54,470 --> 03:26:55,550
Wait, I want to see this.

4494
03:26:55,910 --> 03:26:56,730
No, wait, hold on.

4495
03:26:57,350 --> 03:26:58,550
I wanted to read it.

4496
03:26:58,590 --> 03:27:02,250
A curious lack of internal organs mean no way of inflicting critical damage.

4497
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:02,810
Gibbering insanity.

4498
03:27:03,410 --> 03:27:03,770
Sorry.

4499
03:27:03,930 --> 03:27:05,370
I just wanted to read it real quick.

4500
03:27:05,730 --> 03:27:08,750
The devils inside the servants' skulls were trying to kill me.

4501
03:27:09,210 --> 03:27:12,010
They plotted behind doors, locked and barred.

4502
03:27:12,050 --> 03:27:12,650
These guys are the worst.

4503
03:27:12,650 --> 03:27:14,630
And planned the downfall of the human race.

4504
03:27:14,950 --> 03:27:16,370
The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst.

4505
03:27:16,470 --> 03:27:17,510
I took care of the ones around me.

4506
03:27:17,510 --> 03:27:19,290
Stopped their plans.

4507
03:27:20,070 --> 03:27:21,330
There are others.

4508
03:27:21,470 --> 03:27:22,530
I'm sure.

4509
03:27:22,870 --> 03:27:24,050
Out there.

4510
03:27:25,130 --> 03:27:26,370
Manipulating us.

4511
03:27:26,670 --> 03:27:29,590
Secreting madness inside our very heads.

4512
03:27:29,890 --> 03:27:33,770
While our souls are pushed into the corners of our skulls.

4513
03:27:33,770 --> 03:27:39,970
Watching as our hands do tasks that we have no control over.

4514
03:27:40,650 --> 03:27:41,430
No.

4515
03:27:42,050 --> 03:27:42,830
Horrible.

4516
03:27:44,050 --> 03:27:44,830
Horrible.

4517
03:27:45,150 --> 03:27:45,930
Things.

4518
03:27:46,710 --> 03:27:47,490
I can't.

4519
03:27:47,510 --> 03:27:47,670
I can't.

4520
03:27:47,670 --> 03:27:50,010
We must purge them from our midst.

4521
03:27:50,230 --> 03:27:51,510
Kill them all.

4522
03:27:51,750 --> 03:27:52,750
Cut them.

4523
03:27:52,870 --> 03:27:53,970
Burn them.

4524
03:27:54,870 --> 03:27:57,250
It's the only way.

4525
03:27:57,770 --> 03:27:58,890
I know.

4526
03:28:00,410 --> 03:28:01,170
I've.

4527
03:28:01,170 --> 03:28:02,190
Done it.

4528
03:28:02,730 --> 03:28:03,490
It.

4529
03:28:04,890 --> 03:28:05,650
Works.

4530
03:28:06,370 --> 03:28:07,870
Oh my god.

4531
03:28:08,170 --> 03:28:09,450
Oh my god.

4532
03:28:10,030 --> 03:28:10,790
No.

4533
03:28:11,730 --> 03:28:12,770
Oh my.

4534
03:28:12,950 --> 03:28:13,330
It's.

4535
03:28:13,670 --> 03:28:13,830
It's.

4536
03:28:14,310 --> 03:28:15,770
Holy cow.

4537
03:28:16,730 --> 03:28:17,490
Oh.

4538
03:28:17,510 --> 03:28:23,590
If you don't plan on doing multiple playthroughs, you should look up the other autopsies for the other god enemy variants.

4539
03:28:23,830 --> 03:28:23,910
Oh.

4540
03:28:25,610 --> 03:28:28,090
I haven't decided yet, but thank you.

4541
03:28:28,130 --> 03:28:29,990
I will think about that for.

4542
03:28:32,270 --> 03:28:35,430
So now we use the red here, right?

4543
03:28:37,430 --> 03:28:38,190
Spell list.

4544
03:28:39,790 --> 03:28:43,490
Maybe reveal invisible, cast the red one.

4545
03:28:43,870 --> 03:28:44,410
Maybe?

4546
03:28:45,790 --> 03:28:46,350
Aha!

4547
03:28:50,410 --> 03:28:51,250
There we go.

4548
03:28:52,050 --> 03:28:52,810
And then.

4549
03:28:53,450 --> 03:28:54,630
Our dresser key.

4550
03:28:56,710 --> 03:28:59,450
The voice director probably just said, bro, just cook.

4551
03:28:59,650 --> 03:29:00,010
I know.

4552
03:29:01,570 --> 03:29:02,850
Oh, use the dresser key.

4553
03:29:03,230 --> 03:29:05,330
Ask your doctor about Xelataz.

4554
03:29:07,110 --> 03:29:08,030
What do we get?

4555
03:29:08,250 --> 03:29:08,290
Oh.

4556
03:29:09,550 --> 03:29:12,270
Inside is a chrome finish revolver.

4557
03:29:12,910 --> 03:29:14,310
And a tattered paint.

4558
03:29:14,370 --> 03:29:14,390
Oh.

4559
03:29:14,410 --> 03:29:15,990
And a page from the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

4560
03:29:16,510 --> 03:29:17,370
Yes.

4561
03:29:17,630 --> 03:29:19,330
We got a revolver!

4562
03:29:19,890 --> 03:29:20,930
Oh my gosh.

4563
03:29:20,950 --> 03:29:23,170
It's the best weapon ever made.

4564
03:29:27,970 --> 03:29:30,770
A journey into darkness.

4565
03:29:35,030 --> 03:29:36,510
Park on.

4566
03:29:36,810 --> 03:29:37,910
Park on.

4567
03:29:37,910 --> 03:29:39,250
Park on.

4568
03:29:39,370 --> 03:29:40,070
Park on.

4569
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:40,190
Park on.

4570
03:29:44,210 --> 03:29:45,110
Park on.

4571
03:29:47,110 --> 03:29:47,970
Park on.

4572
03:29:48,490 --> 03:29:50,130
Located within its grave.

4573
03:29:50,530 --> 03:29:51,990
As we suspected.

4574
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:54,870
It shall be retrieved at once.

4575
03:29:55,170 --> 03:29:55,670
Be wary.

4576
03:29:55,950 --> 03:29:58,530
The power of Mantarok lingers still.

4577
03:29:59,050 --> 03:30:01,750
Corroding the universe around its tomb.

4578
03:30:02,130 --> 03:30:05,930
It will doubtlessly be guarded after these seven centuries.

4579
03:30:06,550 --> 03:30:08,630
The beast has not been contained.

4580
03:30:08,970 --> 03:30:09,490
Mr. Beast.

4581
03:30:09,810 --> 03:30:16,510
I can assure you that my binding of Mantarok, fueled by your very own power, will be enough.

4582
03:30:16,730 --> 03:30:17,950
It is not your sword.

4583
03:30:17,950 --> 03:30:20,230
It is the sorcery that we doubt, Augustus.

4584
03:30:20,230 --> 03:30:22,810
The power of the dead god.

4585
03:30:23,290 --> 03:30:23,590
It's your competence.

4586
03:30:23,590 --> 03:30:24,830
Best chapter in the end of time.

4587
03:30:24,890 --> 03:30:29,790
How can you, Amira Jones, comprehend what that entity represents?

4588
03:30:30,370 --> 03:30:32,550
Or what power it can wield?

4589
03:30:32,910 --> 03:30:34,550
We know not.

4590
03:30:34,810 --> 03:30:37,630
And we know more than thou.

4591
03:30:38,030 --> 03:30:40,090
Your future depends on me, Majesty.

4592
03:30:40,550 --> 03:30:42,530
Without me to open the gates...

4593
03:30:42,530 --> 03:30:42,790
Yes.

4594
03:30:42,910 --> 03:30:43,510
Yes.

4595
03:30:43,710 --> 03:30:44,630
Be quick.

4596
03:30:44,690 --> 03:30:47,630
Lest our power and our faith in you...

4597
03:30:47,630 --> 03:30:47,930
No.

4598
03:30:47,950 --> 03:30:48,390
He is calling us from the right.

4599
03:30:48,390 --> 03:30:49,610
Always to uplift...

4600
03:30:49,610 --> 03:30:51,930
The voice acting in this is so good.

4601
03:30:52,170 --> 03:30:52,730
Now, I...

4602
03:30:52,730 --> 03:30:54,550
I am seen differently.

4603
03:31:00,090 --> 03:31:00,690
Stairs.

4604
03:31:02,050 --> 03:31:04,170
Gosh, the voice acting in this is crazy.

4605
03:31:04,390 --> 03:31:04,990
All right, then.

4606
03:31:05,010 --> 03:31:05,930
Before we...

4607
03:31:08,650 --> 03:31:10,230
Before we continue?

4608
03:31:13,270 --> 03:31:16,310
The cutscenes change depending on which god you choose to?

4609
03:31:16,510 --> 03:31:16,810
Really?

4610
03:31:17,950 --> 03:31:19,190
I like the one we got, though.

4611
03:31:19,330 --> 03:31:20,130
She's really cool.

4612
03:31:25,050 --> 03:31:30,130
I guess for this part, we wouldn't really know...

4613
03:31:39,110 --> 03:31:45,570
We wouldn't really know which one would reveal the door, I think.

4614
03:31:47,370 --> 03:31:48,290
Oh, ouch.

4615
03:31:48,550 --> 03:31:49,350
My bad.

4616
03:31:50,970 --> 03:31:53,590
You are assigned to take a bow.

4617
03:31:56,750 --> 03:31:57,790
Reveal invisibility?

4618
03:31:57,970 --> 03:31:59,010
Yeah, but which one would it be?

4619
03:32:03,030 --> 03:32:04,230
We have three of them.

4620
03:32:06,830 --> 03:32:12,170
Try them all.

4621
03:32:14,530 --> 03:32:15,570
With textures.

4622
03:32:18,410 --> 03:32:20,670
But I feel like it would show...

4623
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:20,950
I feel like...

4624
03:32:20,970 --> 03:32:22,150
I feel like it would show, you know?

4625
03:32:23,530 --> 03:32:26,010
I feel like maybe we're not ready for it yet.

4626
03:32:32,210 --> 03:32:33,250
Oh, just kidding.

4627
03:32:33,390 --> 03:32:33,690
Sorry.

4628
03:32:33,790 --> 03:32:36,330
I saw the little sigil on the ground there and I thought it was correct.

4629
03:32:38,230 --> 03:32:38,690
Spell nine?

4630
03:32:41,490 --> 03:32:42,050
Spell nine!

4631
03:32:43,250 --> 03:32:44,050
Which flavor?

4632
03:32:50,610 --> 03:32:52,190
Does this one take out the...

4633
03:32:52,190 --> 03:32:53,630
I'm gonna try it again.

4634
03:32:59,790 --> 03:33:01,990
Dang, I thought it'd take out the force field.

4635
03:33:04,010 --> 03:33:06,290
We have damage field.

4636
03:33:06,770 --> 03:33:08,190
Enchant item, recover...

4637
03:33:08,190 --> 03:33:08,370
What?

4638
03:33:08,470 --> 03:33:09,470
Damage field work, maybe?

4639
03:33:24,840 --> 03:33:25,360
Boo!

4640
03:33:25,360 --> 03:33:25,880
Boo!

4641
03:33:27,280 --> 03:33:27,800
Okay.

4642
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:28,600
Oh well.

4643
03:33:37,850 --> 03:33:38,830
Well then.

4644
03:33:43,750 --> 03:33:44,870
Very cool.

4645
03:33:45,090 --> 03:33:51,250
I'm going to start the next chapter, but I'm going to end it before we get too far into it.

4646
03:33:52,270 --> 03:33:55,130
And then, what chapter is this actually?

4647
03:33:55,410 --> 03:33:56,250
I don't even know.

4648
03:33:57,790 --> 03:33:59,370
Chapter of darkness.

4649
03:33:59,790 --> 03:34:00,090
Yeah.

4650
03:34:00,690 --> 03:34:01,910
Needs more power, god.

4651
03:34:03,470 --> 03:34:04,590
So true.

4652
03:34:04,590 --> 03:34:04,630
It's true.

4653
03:34:09,170 --> 03:34:10,270
Wait, let's see.

4654
03:34:11,330 --> 03:34:12,450
Maybe we can see here.

4655
03:34:12,830 --> 03:34:13,150
Oh no.

4656
03:34:13,250 --> 03:34:14,090
Cin-cinema.

4657
03:34:14,470 --> 03:34:14,910
Cinema.

4658
03:34:18,670 --> 03:34:22,030
If you like voice acting, that goes hard, try Legacy of Kainser's.

4659
03:34:22,110 --> 03:34:22,410
Ooh.

4660
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:24,070
I don't know that one actually.

4661
03:34:24,170 --> 03:34:28,190
The main character for the next chapter is actually voiced by an actor for Jack Bauer.

4662
03:34:28,910 --> 03:34:29,350
Oh.

4663
03:34:29,490 --> 03:34:30,430
That one is Neil.

4664
03:34:31,030 --> 03:34:32,530
You actually got me!

4665
03:34:32,710 --> 03:34:33,530
Mr. Yuta!

4666
03:34:36,530 --> 03:34:38,030
You actually got me.

4667
03:34:41,170 --> 03:34:43,410
Later chapters are going to be fun if you really like this one.

4668
03:34:43,570 --> 03:34:44,030
Oh yay.

4669
03:34:45,030 --> 03:34:47,630
Wait, this one coming up or the one that I just did.

4670
03:34:47,730 --> 03:34:48,950
Because I really liked the one I just did.

4671
03:34:49,410 --> 03:34:51,630
The ancients influence was incredible.

4672
03:34:52,510 --> 03:34:55,670
From all walks of life to all parts of the world.

4673
03:34:55,690 --> 03:34:56,470
Indiana Jones time.

4674
03:34:56,650 --> 03:34:59,650
Their tendrils crept and wrought their insidious damage.

4675
03:35:00,570 --> 03:35:02,710
Their prisons decayed constantly.

4676
03:35:19,650 --> 03:35:28,290
We're getting closer and closer to our present time.

4677
03:35:41,370 --> 03:35:46,330
It's playing as Vulcan.

4678
03:35:46,370 --> 03:35:47,710
What do you mean?

4679
03:35:52,210 --> 03:35:52,770
1983!

4680
03:35:56,230 --> 03:35:57,350
1983!

4681
03:36:06,510 --> 03:36:07,210
Oh my god.

4682
03:36:08,410 --> 03:36:08,890
Hello?

4683
03:36:09,070 --> 03:36:10,590
Why is Skull Face walking with us?

4684
03:36:14,530 --> 03:36:16,350
It's Snake and Skull Face!

4685
03:36:17,750 --> 03:36:18,890
Satellite Dana was correct!

4686
03:36:23,970 --> 03:36:31,290
I hear Mint died.

4687
03:36:31,510 --> 03:36:32,270
What are you talking about?

4688
03:36:34,510 --> 03:36:37,850
It's an optional and kind of OP thing you can get in this chapter.

4689
03:36:37,910 --> 03:36:39,370
You might want to consider looking it up.

4690
03:36:41,370 --> 03:36:41,850
Hey!

4691
03:36:44,470 --> 03:36:44,950
Yeah!

4692
03:36:45,110 --> 03:36:45,590
Punch him!

4693
03:36:47,130 --> 03:36:49,170
Take his gun before you run away?

4694
03:36:49,330 --> 03:36:49,870
What are you doing?

4695
03:36:51,750 --> 03:36:52,230
Oh!

4696
03:36:52,430 --> 03:36:53,190
Nice shot!

4697
03:36:56,930 --> 03:36:58,150
What's wrong with you?

4698
03:36:59,770 --> 03:37:00,610
Stormtrooper aim!

4699
03:37:00,850 --> 03:37:02,690
You are a scholar, Dr. Lindsey.

4700
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:04,030
Not a warrior.

4701
03:37:04,170 --> 03:37:08,710
In that regard, I have several centuries more experience than you.

4702
03:37:11,830 --> 03:37:13,070
Don't be a fool.

4703
03:37:13,880 --> 03:37:14,930
Die quietly.

4704
03:37:16,050 --> 03:37:18,330
And you will not suffer.

4705
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:22,170
You cannot escape me, Lindsey.

4706
03:37:22,510 --> 03:37:24,710
This place will be your tomb.

4707
03:37:25,030 --> 03:37:27,290
Just as it is Mantarox.

4708
03:37:27,530 --> 03:37:27,870
Hello?

4709
03:37:28,070 --> 03:37:28,870
What the hell?

4710
03:37:29,110 --> 03:37:31,550
Kill him!

4711
03:37:32,270 --> 03:37:32,930
Wait!

4712
03:37:34,170 --> 03:37:34,770
Wait a second!

4713
03:37:35,310 --> 03:37:37,450
Is this a boss battle right at the front?

4714
03:37:37,830 --> 03:37:38,510
No way.

4715
03:37:39,710 --> 03:37:44,670
Oh my god.

4716
03:37:44,810 --> 03:37:45,770
Are you kidding me?

4717
03:37:50,770 --> 03:37:51,290
Hello?

4718
03:37:52,470 --> 03:37:53,890
I was just gonna start the...

4719
03:37:53,890 --> 03:37:55,150
the chapter?

4720
03:37:57,670 --> 03:37:59,210
Not expecting this?

4721
03:38:01,390 --> 03:38:03,450
It's just draining and draining and draining.

4722
03:38:03,450 --> 03:38:04,670
I got five bullets left.

4723
03:38:07,290 --> 03:38:09,650
I can't hear you over your sludge.

4724
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:12,010
His face!

4725
03:38:12,190 --> 03:38:12,650
There we go.

4726
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:20,530
Gotta bait it to open up.

4727
03:38:22,030 --> 03:38:22,830
Oh gosh.

4728
03:38:28,950 --> 03:38:29,510
Can

4729
03:38:32,700 --> 03:38:33,880
I get more bullets?

4730
03:38:34,400 --> 03:38:34,800
Please?

4731
03:38:42,350 --> 03:38:43,830
I don't know if that actually did anything.

4732
03:38:55,550 --> 03:38:56,190
Oh my god.

4733
03:38:56,270 --> 03:38:56,810
Oh my god.

4734
03:38:56,870 --> 03:38:57,230
Oh my god.

4735
03:38:58,070 --> 03:38:58,470
Oh.

4736
03:38:58,550 --> 03:38:58,930
Oh.

4737
03:38:59,130 --> 03:39:00,090
You're a little late.

4738
03:39:00,150 --> 03:39:01,050
Your timing, please.

4739
03:39:04,130 --> 03:39:04,670
Uh oh.

4740
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:06,030
Um...

4741
03:39:08,310 --> 03:39:09,130
Oh, I can reload.

4742
03:39:12,510 --> 03:39:13,190
Oh, okay.

4743
03:39:13,290 --> 03:39:13,850
We're fine.

4744
03:39:15,090 --> 03:39:16,070
We're fine, everybody.

4745
03:39:16,550 --> 03:39:17,250
Where is it?

4746
03:39:17,850 --> 03:39:18,130
Where'd he go?

4747
03:39:18,270 --> 03:39:18,770
Hello?

4748
03:39:23,770 --> 03:39:25,610
I don't think that did anything.

4749
03:39:51,110 --> 03:39:52,730
We got our archaeology...

4750
03:39:53,930 --> 03:39:54,990
Archaeologist brush.

4751
03:39:55,350 --> 03:39:56,270
A torch.

4752
03:39:56,570 --> 03:39:57,510
Some ammo.

4753
03:39:58,210 --> 03:39:59,670
Oh, a shotgun.

4754
03:39:59,810 --> 03:39:59,970
Wait.

4755
03:40:00,050 --> 03:40:01,290
Oh, these are shotgun shells.

4756
03:40:01,710 --> 03:40:03,370
I was like, oh, we're fine.

4757
03:40:03,510 --> 03:40:05,130
On the shotgun ammo.

4758
03:40:05,470 --> 03:40:06,610
We got a...

4759
03:40:08,350 --> 03:40:09,590
A pistol.

4760
03:40:09,770 --> 03:40:10,070
Dang.

4761
03:40:10,330 --> 03:40:11,230
Our guy is low.

4762
03:40:12,250 --> 03:40:13,730
Shotgun kills it in two hits.

4763
03:40:14,770 --> 03:40:15,370
That's okay.

4764
03:40:15,550 --> 03:40:16,630
I don't need to...

4765
03:40:17,210 --> 03:40:18,170
I'm not speedrunning.

4766
03:40:18,410 --> 03:40:18,850
It's all good.

4767
03:40:21,490 --> 03:40:22,890
I'm getting the hell out of here.

4768
03:40:24,530 --> 03:40:27,090
Lindsey has no intention of leaving the temple.

4769
03:40:27,290 --> 03:40:27,730
Just kidding.

4770
03:40:27,990 --> 03:40:30,870
He's determined to get to the artifact before Augustine does.

4771
03:40:31,090 --> 03:40:33,430
No one crosses Edwin Lindsey.

4772
03:40:38,810 --> 03:40:39,770
Kuwabara kuwabara.

4773
03:40:42,070 --> 03:40:43,490
I should probably save.

4774
03:40:44,230 --> 03:40:47,390
And that was a fun start to the chapter.

4775
03:40:54,640 --> 03:40:56,980
Why are they doing him so dirty like that?

4776
03:40:58,280 --> 03:40:59,920
Why does he look like Dr. Edwin?

4777
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:01,680
What is this one?

4778
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:02,380
Oh, it's her.

4779
03:41:02,740 --> 03:41:03,180
I was confused.

4780
03:41:04,000 --> 03:41:04,780
Kiki Ricky.

4781
03:41:07,100 --> 03:41:08,060
He's pogging.

4782
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:10,640
I don't know about that.

4783
03:41:11,720 --> 03:41:15,120
Wait, this is actually Volgen's voice actor?

4784
03:41:15,340 --> 03:41:15,840
No way.

4785
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:17,960
Oh!

4786
03:41:23,220 --> 03:41:24,660
I just realized we're here!

4787
03:41:25,100 --> 03:41:29,100
Statue of a seated goddess where her neck and wrists should bear jewelry.

4788
03:41:29,360 --> 03:41:32,280
There are merely worn grooves and flecks of bronze dust.

4789
03:41:32,540 --> 03:41:34,520
Have they been stolen by grave robbers?

4790
03:41:36,220 --> 03:41:38,100
Actually, by me!

4791
03:41:39,880 --> 03:41:41,580
I stole it!

4792
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:44,840
I stole it!

4793
03:41:45,700 --> 03:41:47,760
Wow, this is the area where we were Oh, look at that girl!

4794
03:41:49,520 --> 03:41:51,460
Wait, will we have to fight her, I wonder?

4795
03:41:52,360 --> 03:41:53,180
Okay, guys.

4796
03:41:57,280 --> 03:41:57,960
Uh-oh.

4797
03:41:58,240 --> 03:41:59,800
I have stamina now.

4798
03:42:01,460 --> 03:42:03,600
I have stamina now.

4799
03:42:04,900 --> 03:42:05,420
Interesting.

4800
03:42:08,820 --> 03:42:11,140
Thick layer of dust obscures the tiles on the floor.

4801
03:42:22,300 --> 03:42:24,040
Bronze bracelet has been discovered

4802
03:42:31,090 --> 03:42:32,410
Don't look at the camera.

4803
03:42:34,090 --> 03:42:34,530
Okay.

4804
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:49,400
Nice.

4805
03:42:51,820 --> 03:42:52,260
Okay.

4806
03:42:52,880 --> 03:42:55,460
Okay, I'm gonna keep playing if I don't stop here.

4807
03:42:55,600 --> 03:42:56,600
I'm going to keep playing.

4808
03:42:56,680 --> 03:42:59,960
I'm going to keep playing if I don't stop here.

4809
03:43:00,060 --> 03:43:01,660
I will stop here, everybody.

4810
03:43:02,500 --> 03:43:02,940
Um...

4811
03:43:02,940 --> 03:43:04,240
I'm thinking, what?

4812
03:43:04,300 --> 03:43:05,300
Two more streams?

4813
03:43:06,960 --> 03:43:08,260
For the rest of it?

4814
03:43:08,320 --> 03:43:11,840
Because we got through three, I think three yesterday, three today.

4815
03:43:15,260 --> 03:43:15,940
Or so?

4816
03:43:21,460 --> 03:43:22,960
Two sounds right, yeah.

4817
03:43:29,980 --> 03:43:31,600
Oh yeah, two and a half.

4818
03:43:31,680 --> 03:43:32,440
That's true, yeah.

4819
03:43:34,320 --> 03:43:34,780
Um...

4820
03:43:36,200 --> 03:43:36,640
So...

4821
03:43:37,880 --> 03:43:38,320
Um...

4822
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:39,260
Yeah.

4823
03:43:40,180 --> 03:43:40,800
We'll see.

4824
03:43:41,700 --> 03:43:42,660
Two to three?

4825
03:43:42,800 --> 03:43:44,720
Yeah, maybe if we have to do a third one.

4826
03:43:45,780 --> 03:43:46,220
Yeah!

4827
03:43:47,480 --> 03:43:49,440
This was so fun.

4828
03:43:49,620 --> 03:43:52,760
I'm loving all the different stuff that we're learning.

4829
03:43:52,980 --> 03:43:54,980
Like, now that we got all...

4830
03:43:54,980 --> 03:43:56,320
Oh, we don't have the tome yet.

4831
03:43:56,500 --> 03:43:57,880
So I was like, where's my spells?

4832
03:43:58,560 --> 03:43:59,940
Um, once we get...

4833
03:43:59,940 --> 03:44:01,780
Once we get our...

4834
03:44:03,120 --> 03:44:04,780
Oh, why can you hear it?

4835
03:44:06,240 --> 03:44:08,280
Once we get all the stuff...

4836
03:44:08,280 --> 03:44:08,500
Once we get all the stuff...

4837
03:44:08,500 --> 03:44:10,600
Or like, we have all our spells now.

4838
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:12,940
We're getting cooler weapons and everything.

4839
03:44:13,340 --> 03:44:13,700
We're getting cooler weapons and everything.

4840
03:44:13,700 --> 03:44:14,280
Have a good night, Min.

4841
03:44:14,380 --> 03:44:14,880
Thank you!

4842
03:44:15,060 --> 03:44:18,540
And we're getting through stuff in the mansion, so it's getting more exciting.

4843
03:44:20,340 --> 03:44:24,560
I'm shocked that whatever is going on is all underneath us.

4844
03:44:24,820 --> 03:44:25,520
I'm shocked that whatever is going on is all underneath us.

4845
03:44:25,520 --> 03:44:26,760
I'm very like...

4846
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:27,560
I'm very like...

4847
03:44:27,560 --> 03:44:30,860
I'm still confused what's going on, but I feel...

4848
03:44:30,860 --> 03:44:31,700
I'm still confused what's going on, but I feel...

4849
03:44:32,380 --> 03:44:32,860
Um...

4850
03:44:34,140 --> 03:44:34,620
Also...

4851
03:44:34,620 --> 03:44:35,920
A little more...

4852
03:44:35,920 --> 03:44:39,180
Also, paragon, paragon, paragon, paragon.

4853
03:44:39,520 --> 03:44:40,220
I think.

4854
03:44:41,180 --> 03:44:41,660
Yeah.

4855
03:44:41,780 --> 03:44:44,260
So I have no idea what's going on, but this has been really fun.

4856
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:47,020
Great job on getting a hold of the game mechanics.

4857
03:44:47,960 --> 03:44:48,860
Thank you!

4858
03:44:48,980 --> 03:44:49,720
Yeah, I've...

4859
03:44:50,480 --> 03:44:53,000
I think I've mostly...

4860
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,220
I'm getting more and more used to it.

4861
03:44:55,320 --> 03:44:56,900
So, paragon, paragon, paragon.

4862
03:44:58,880 --> 03:44:59,360
Two!

4863
03:44:59,360 --> 03:45:00,760
Thanks, TryPrincess!

4864
03:45:01,320 --> 03:45:02,020
Thank you.

4865
03:45:02,940 --> 03:45:03,440
Um...

4866
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:05,640
And the chapters have been really...

4867
03:45:05,640 --> 03:45:09,220
I think I really like that each chapter kind of introduces something different.

4868
03:45:09,280 --> 03:45:10,900
And, um...

4869
03:45:10,900 --> 03:45:12,340
Has been different.

4870
03:45:12,520 --> 03:45:13,500
A different feel.

4871
03:45:13,640 --> 03:45:15,540
It's so crazy.

4872
03:45:16,660 --> 03:45:19,520
This game is so crazy, but I'm really enjoying it.

4873
03:45:19,600 --> 03:45:21,020
I can see why people really like it.

4874
03:45:22,700 --> 03:45:23,700
But, um...

4875
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:26,380
Notice I haven't been audible all stream?

4876
03:45:27,540 --> 03:45:28,040
Oh!

4877
03:45:31,480 --> 03:45:32,360
I realize...

4878
03:45:32,840 --> 03:45:34,200
That I had it turned off.

4879
03:45:34,260 --> 03:45:34,620
My bad.

4880
03:45:34,780 --> 03:45:35,580
But I can hear them.

4881
03:45:35,700 --> 03:45:36,140
Sorry.

4882
03:45:38,460 --> 03:45:38,900
Oopsie.

4883
03:45:38,900 --> 03:45:41,320
They're only audible on my side.

4884
03:45:42,120 --> 03:45:42,560
Sorry.

4885
03:45:46,680 --> 03:45:47,420
My bad.

4886
03:45:48,100 --> 03:45:48,740
My bad.

4887
03:45:48,840 --> 03:45:51,600
I did it so that I wouldn't be confused about sound.

4888
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:55,320
But it should be okay now.

4889
03:45:55,960 --> 03:45:57,240
I mean, now you can hear them.

4890
03:45:57,920 --> 03:45:59,340
But I'm also ending the stream.

4891
03:46:00,200 --> 03:46:02,400
I haven't been called a simp once.

4892
03:46:02,660 --> 03:46:02,800
Oh!

4893
03:46:03,860 --> 03:46:05,520
You're a simp!

4894
03:46:07,920 --> 03:46:08,520
Um...

4895
03:46:08,520 --> 03:46:09,280
Arigato!

4896
03:46:09,900 --> 03:46:10,500
Arigato!

4897
03:46:15,020 --> 03:46:15,620
Um...

4898
03:46:15,620 --> 03:46:17,040
What's another one?

4899
03:46:17,660 --> 03:46:18,100
Oh.

4900
03:46:18,140 --> 03:46:19,800
Oh, wait!

4901
03:46:23,060 --> 03:46:24,180
I did it!

4902
03:46:24,300 --> 03:46:25,520
I should add...

4903
03:46:25,520 --> 03:46:25,840
Please

4904
03:46:39,010 --> 03:46:41,990
wrap it up.

4905
03:46:42,150 --> 03:46:43,150
Shut the hell up!

4906
03:46:44,090 --> 03:46:44,790
Shut up, Murphy!

4907
03:46:51,290 --> 03:46:51,790
Um...

4908
03:46:51,790 --> 03:46:54,290
You said you would add it like two months ago.

4909
03:46:54,490 --> 03:46:54,870
You're right.

4910
03:46:56,010 --> 03:46:57,410
I need to add that one.

4911
03:46:58,570 --> 03:46:59,070
Um...

4912
03:46:59,070 --> 03:47:00,950
Why is the zombie caked up?

4913
03:47:01,190 --> 03:47:01,490
Damn!

4914
03:47:01,590 --> 03:47:02,110
You're right!

4915
03:47:02,850 --> 03:47:03,850
Holy cow!

4916
03:47:06,270 --> 03:47:10,470
I never knew that I needed a half-skelly, half-human in my life before.

4917
03:47:10,990 --> 03:47:12,070
Or in my afterlife.

4918
03:47:13,970 --> 03:47:15,010
Toot-toot-a-roll.

4919
03:47:15,010 --> 03:47:16,310
Shut up.

4920
03:47:16,610 --> 03:47:17,550
Shut up!

4921
03:47:23,900 --> 03:47:24,880
Toot-toot-a-roll.

4922
03:47:24,940 --> 03:47:25,580
There you said it.

4923
03:47:30,620 --> 03:47:32,040
I'll add toot-toot-a-roll.

4924
03:47:33,980 --> 03:47:35,060
I'll add it.

4925
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:38,820
I'll add it.

4926
03:47:41,020 --> 03:47:41,960
I'll add it.

4927
03:47:41,960 --> 03:47:42,580
I'll add it.

4928
03:47:44,540 --> 03:47:45,100
I'll add it.

4929
03:47:45,360 --> 03:47:45,920
I'll add it.

4930
03:47:46,220 --> 03:47:47,060
Thank you guys.

4931
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:50,640
You're a simp!

4932
03:47:51,880 --> 03:47:52,620
You're a simp!

4933
03:47:57,020 --> 03:47:58,340
Thank you guys for watching.

4934
03:47:58,420 --> 03:47:59,280
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4935
03:47:59,340 --> 03:48:00,800
I'll see you guys later.

4936
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:01,660
Have a good night.

4937
03:48:02,080 --> 03:48:02,880
Bye-bye.

4938
03:48:03,180 --> 03:48:03,960
Thank you.

4939
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:06,260
Thank you.

4940
03:48:08,360 --> 03:48:09,160
Bye-bye.

4941
03:48:09,460 --> 03:48:09,980
Bye-bye.

4942
03:48:10,080 --> 03:48:10,240
Bye-bye.

4943
03:48:10,620 --> 03:48:13,660
Oh my

4944
03:48:17,620 --> 03:48:17,860
god.

4945
03:48:17,960 --> 03:48:19,700
Thanks for the five gifted.

4946
03:48:21,380 --> 03:48:23,120
I didn't realize you could still hear me either.

4947
03:48:23,620 --> 03:48:24,020
Okay.

4948
03:48:24,020 --> 03:48:25,240
Now I turn off my...

4949
03:48:39,400 --> 03:48:40,080
Arigato.

4950
03:48:40,140 --> 03:48:40,800
Arigato.

4951
03:48:40,820 --> 03:48:43,880
Thank you.

4952
03:48:44,420 --> 03:48:45,580
See you.

4953
03:48:45,960 --> 03:48:46,840
Bye-bye.

4954
03:48:47,100 --> 03:48:48,640
Bye-bye now.

4955
03:48:49,800 --> 03:48:50,240
Bye!
