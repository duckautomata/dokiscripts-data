00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,260
Yes.

12
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,480
Yes.

13
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,960
Too smart.

I, um, okay.

16
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,820
I played Myst a couple days ago.

17
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,120
Two days ago.

18
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,780
And...

19
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,900
I said then, I can't keep playing Myst because I have a
meeting.

20
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,000
And you know what?

21
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,520
That meeting got moved to today.

22
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
So I have to beat it.

23
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,560
I have to beat it before my meeting in three hours.

24
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,940
I think we could do it.

25
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,460
I think we could do it.

26
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,750
Yeah, it was like, seems doable.

27
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,690
Yeah, you think so.

28
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,650
I think we can do it.

29
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,330
I think we could do it.

30
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,510
I don't want to rush or anything, but...

31
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,990
the turn tables.

32
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,710
It was funny because I was like ready for the meeting.

33
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,170
I was like, okay, let's go.

34
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:59,090
And then Phoebe was like, um, actually my family wanted to
eat dinner today.

35
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,510
They changed the date for me.

36
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,910
And we were like, oh, we can't.

37
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,590
She was like, I'll join like, I'll go in another room and
join via mobile.

38
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,710
And we were like, we can't have you miss your dinner with
your family.

39
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,810
So, um,

40
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,970
So, let's load back in, baby.

41
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:35,270
I went to Phoebe's stream after yours and was like, um...

42
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,710
Ah, yeah.

43
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,750
It's okay, though.

44
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,530
Alrighty, okay, okey-dokey.

45
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,530
Let's get my bearings.

46
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,150
Oh, I have to pull up my notes that I took.

47
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,470
Let's see.

48
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,530
I wrote some notes before.

49
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,750
Like, the sunken ship.

50
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,340
The spaceship we did.

51
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,040
That was the 59 volts.

52
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,060
The gear we have not done.

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,220
The metal gear.

54
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,120
Hello, meantime.

55
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,020
Viewers like you.

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
My advice for the day.

57
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,420
Check the expiration date on your milk before you bring it
to work.

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,820
Mario almost got me too.

59
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
No way!

60
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,120
Yeah, the big clank.

61
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,780
The big clank.

62
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Let's go take a look at it real quick.

63
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,100
How do...

64
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,060
Is there anything even to do here?

65
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,760
Like, there's nothing for me to click, is there?

66
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm clicking everywhere?

67
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,500
What was the hint you got from the tower?

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Um, it was 2.40, 2.2.

69
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,980
Like, 2.40 time.

70
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,500
2.1 for the gear.

71
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,560
town at least.

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,600
I don't understand at all.

73
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,020
Does it ever do anything?

74
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,060
No.

75
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,500
No of any clocks.

76
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,070
We're there.

77
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,730
the dentist.

78
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,990
Oh, I hope it's scary.

79
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,330
I didn't turn on the line.

80
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,350
But they didn't give me a date.

81
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,350
So I think we're a...

82
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,830
Okay.

83
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,570
Door closing.

84
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,850
IMP3.

85
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,190
Um, we did here.

86
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,790
Hold on.

87
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,070
There's also something about the sunken ship I wrote.

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,250
Let's see, what did I write?

89
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,310
October 11th, 1984, 10.04 a.m.

90
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,970
And then January 17th, 1207, 554, 5.46 a.m.

91
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,210
November 23rd, 9,791, 657 p.m.

92
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,430
Something about the sunken ship.

93
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,210
Wait, the clock!

94
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,730
But I can't do anything with this guy.

95
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,290
Wait, 240?

96
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,670
Two?

97
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,350
I wonder if it's like two, like, spin two, spin two, spin
two.

98
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:51,430
one or something and then he tries I wonder but this is

100
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,280
It's nonsensical!

101
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,680
Wait.

102
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,960
Five.

103
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,470

104
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,730
Six.

105
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,950
Seven, eight, nine.

106
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,230
Ten, eleven, twelve.

107
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,490
One, two.

108
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:15,610

2, 2, 3.

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,060
Oh, it's so close!

113
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,420
This is so close.

114
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,020
Wait, okay, hold on.

115
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,700
Oh.

116
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,720
Hello?

117
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,380
Hello?

118
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,860
Uh-oh.

119
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Did I mess it up?

120
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,860
Thank you.

121
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,700

127
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,730

128
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,380
Let me see.

129
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Oh, it does.

130
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm stupid.

131
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,080
Guys, why does this feel like?

132
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,760
It feels like when I'm doing those, what's the words?

133
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Like the puzzle, the slide puzzles.

134
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,200
It feels like one of those.

135
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,060
Hi, Minto.

136
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,080
Hello.

137
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,460
Mm-hmm.

138
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,040
Feels very...

139
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,200
Okay.

140
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,030
Does it go...

141
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,290
Hold on.

142
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,890
I'm going to see...

143
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,130
Okay.

144
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,930
I see.

145
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,690
Oh, my gosh.

146
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm so close.

147
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,750
if only I'm here again

148
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:49,190
I wish it let me go more than I wish it let me mess up as
much as I wanted to you know without this thing going all

149
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:56,950
the way down I wish I didn't have to reset the game is
clearly like it's a skill issue if you can't get it within

150
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,110
this number of within this number of tries it's a skill
issue Try holding the lever.

151
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,670
Thanks for coming to Asakioru on Saturday, I'm in town.

152
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,870
Oh, of course.

153
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,090
If I hold it...

154
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,790
It only does that metal!

155
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,070
Oh, my gosh.

156
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,850
That's why I was so mad.

157
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
See, yeah, I would have never...

158
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,700
I probably would have never done it, though.

159
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
Oh, there we go.

160
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Okay.

161
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,120
Alright.

162
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,690
Ta-da!

163
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,290
Today's my birthday!

164
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,690
I was wondering if you could wish me a happy birthday.

165
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,270
Thanks for the stream.

166
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,790
Fain Rear!

167
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,210
Happy birthday!

168
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,770
Happy, happy birthday!

169
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,630
Thank you!

170
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,290
Thank you so much!

171
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,490
I believe in you, that believes in you.

172
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,750
I'm believing, we're believing.

173
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,550
What did it do?

174
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,990
What did it do?

175
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,490
Wait, mysterious music happened and then...

176
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,430
Wait, this opened.

177
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,130
Wait, does that reset it?

178
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,110
Like, does this close?

179
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,350
Oh, I messed up.

180
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,110
Okay, I have to do it over again.

181
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,850
I didn't think that would do that.

182
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,070
My bad.

183
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,470
Okay, wait.

184
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,090
Do you think then the gear over here is now open?

185
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,570
But also, we must see if the...

186
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,870
Okay, the really loud...

187
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,950
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

188
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,170
I turn it down?

189
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,510
If this now...

190
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,490
Oh, okay.

191
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,970
The tower does not need the rotation.

192
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:31,930
probably because it's this it's connected to that gear so i
think we're okay all right let's go inside the gear the

193
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:43,770
clank mgs fox now gives xp for custom matches no way we need
to do it like a member stream or something oh it's open whoa

194
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:54,070
what is this oh it's a book let's go we're going to the
metal Whoa!

195
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,670
Whoa!

196
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Whoa!

197
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,770
Is this a roller coaster?

198
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,670
Whoa!

199
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,030
All the gears are making me think of Star Skates.

200
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,770
We're here.

201
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,370
What is here anyway?

202
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,930
Water.

203
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,450
Well, expensive water.

204
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,590
What's this do?

205
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,310
Hmm, okay.

206
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,590
Imagine I like just, I was like, la la la la la.

207
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,070
And I got it?

208
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,390
That'd be crazy.

209
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,730
What's this?

210
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,370
This looks like it'll open up.

211
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,910
Wow.

212
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,470
Oh.

213
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,670
Metal Gear Jojinchi, let's go!

214
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,810
Oh.

215
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,330
Oh.

216
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,400
The snake?

217
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,460
Oh my god.

218
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,080
It's really Metal Gear.

219
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,180
Ow!

220
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,880
Thank you.

221
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,280
Wait.

222
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,800
Just in the CEO...

223
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,740
Um...

224
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,700
Wait, what?

225
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,180
Thank you so much for the 50 gift!

226
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,880
What?

227
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,440
What is your history?

228
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,500
What is it?

229
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,900
What's this?

230
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,960
Oh...

231
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,820
Oh...

232
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,400
Oh...

233
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,220
Whoa, I'm clicking on literally everything.

234
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,680
Okay.

235
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,220
Let's continue.

236
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,180
Oh, what's here?

237
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,820
Oh,

238
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,340
okay.

239
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,360
Okay, so I can only...

240
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,060
I can't let go.

241
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,320
I don't think so.

242
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,800
Okay.

243
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,260
It's red now.

244
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
What does that mean?

245
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,300
Oh, this is red now, okay?

246
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,080
Does it change anything in here?

247
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,200
Wait, what the heck is this?

248
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,260
I completely missed this!

249
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,220
Oh my god.

250
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,700
There's just...

251
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,260
Fortress Rotation Simulator Calibrating, okay?

252
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,660
There's just knobs and levers after knobs and levers.

253
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,920
Okay.

254
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,020
Am I turning it at all or...

255
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,020
Oh, here we go.

256
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,110
Bink!

257
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,690
Wait, is it the same as like north is this sound?

258
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,870
And then...

259
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,870
Oh, no, please.

260
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,870
Yeah, oh no.

261
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,510
I've heard these sounds before!

262
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
These sounds before...

263
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,420
I've played...

264
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,280
I've played these games before.

265
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,840
What is this, though?

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100
I thought it would open when we turned red.

267
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,160
Oh.

268
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,220
Oh.

269
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,080
Hello, madam.

270
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,380
We got a boat.

271
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,720
That looks like the one that's sunk in our...

272
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
In our spaceship!

273
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,680
Wait a second.

274
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,400
These are our goods.

275
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,480
They're little miniatures.

276
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,380
what the hell is going on in this sorry it was so bright oh
my gosh

277
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:50,400
and then there's the what are these I can't press them they
do nothing there's every oh

278
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
there's chest

279
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,450
a bird

280
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,900
There is nonsensical everything going on in here.

281
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,100
Okay, did I change anything when I rotated it?

282
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:22,840
Flashbang.

283
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
I literally got flashbang.

284
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,410
Huh.

285
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,130
That was a simulator.

286
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,630
Even the thing I did downstairs?

287
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,390
When I rotated it red?

288
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,680
Okay.

289
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,200
Alright, I don't think I can go...

290
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,320
Oh, I think I need to be able to turn this so we can go over
there.

291
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,760
Yeah, what I did was real, but it didn't turn anything.

292
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
There's so many things.

293
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,780
There's so many things to look at.

294
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,340
I'm going to try this again.

295
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,120
Yes!

296
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Oh, what's this?

297
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,640
I can't grab the knife.

298
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,240
Okay.

299
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,120
Alright, let's...

300
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,620
Oh, no.

301
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,700
That's not where I wanted to go.

302
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,380
This way.

303
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Let's try this room again.

304
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,080
If I...

305
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,120
If I close it, I didn't actually get to look at what the red
was.

306
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,840
So let's go inside.

307
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,500
Oh!

308
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,340
Oh, see!

309
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,060
I should have just done that.

310
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,480
Oh, my God.

311
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,480
I have a boon.

312
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,240
Cool.

313
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,980
Oh, what is that?

314
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,030
Oh.

315
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,190
So there's a timer?

316
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,330
Let's try...

317
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:03,990
Different.

318
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:05,830
Oh.

319
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,630
Oh, I see.

320
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:08,850
There!

321
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,990
That's only rotating the inner though.

322
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,470
We want the outer as well.

323
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,370
We have to find a way to rotate the outer.

324
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,180
Yeah, we only have the one lever.

325
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,760
I wonder if it's...

326
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
Oh, now I can't go in here.

327
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,280
Only when it's red can I use the elevator.

328
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,720
I don't even know where to start, you guys.

329
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,760
Let's go back to this bird.

330
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,820
And then this is the little clock.

331
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,800
Okay, and we might get flashbanged again, I'm so sorry.

332
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,000
Please glow, but don't do anything right now.

333
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,550
This I can't do anything with?

334
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,550
Okay.

335
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,830
If I click on the lady, nothing happens.

336
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Each room has its own soundtrack.

337
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,940
It's very exciting.

338
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,000
I've

339
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,700
had a complete total loss.

340
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,120
No, I don't want to do this one again!

341
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,860
Fortress Rotation Simulator!

342
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,980
This was a simulation game this whole time, you guys.

343
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,820
Hey!

344
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,180
Hey!

345
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,840
Get me out of here!

346
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,920
And then this is open, but I can't open it.

347
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:53,520
I could only look what's even the puzzle your guess is as
good as mine your guess is we have two rooms

348
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,200
we have

349
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,250
it's so nonsensical

350
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:22,270
hi I'm the new minfa and I met you during the asayadu collab
I'm so glad to be you to be my first ever meet in green i

351
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:32,210
can't wait to see you again in the future meet the brother
thank you oh my gosh thank you so much thank you thank you

352
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,810
thank you

353
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,130
i'll stop this but i don't think this is until

354
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,970
uh until over here

355
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,310
thank you so much uh

356
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,130
The puzzle is a puzzle in itself.

357
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,670
I know.

358
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,890
I think if anyone wants to give me a hint of where to start.

359
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,230
Of like something I should be looking at.

360
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,890
Vague, vague hint.

361
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,150
So I can try.

362
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,670
I'm like literally clicking everything.

363
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,390
But I'm noticing this one is green and this one is red.

364
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,210
I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

365
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,710
Is your brain currently debuffs because you're not wearing
the smarty glasses?

366
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,070
No!

367
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,000
The elevator, okay, the elevator.

368
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,700
I see you guys saying elevator.

369
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,900
No, thank you so much!

370
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,720
For them, thank you, thank you, thank you.

371
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,840
I'm gonna test something real quick.

372
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,560
Does it turn red?

373
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,260
It's also like...

374
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,820
Okay, it only turns red here, okay.

375
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:24,540
Alright, ride the elevator, they say.

376
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Can I go down?

377
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,040
Nope.

378
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,440
See what this is.

379
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,120
The mid-floor.

380
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,940
I can't turn around.

381
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,480
So let's go.

382
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,300
There is no window.

383
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,140
Am I crazy?

384
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:00,880
Oh!

385
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,060
Oh!

386
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,720
Oh!

387
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,240
Oh!

388
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,380
What is this?

389
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,740
Those are the levers I need, no?

390
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,740
Oh, wait.

391
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,340
I think what we have to do...

392
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,220
Isn't this the timer?

393
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,160
Yeah.

394
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,760
Because it's up here.

395
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,880
If the lever goes down...

396
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,120
Or if the elevator goes down.

397
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,900
Oh!

398
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,180
Okay.

399
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,080
Um.

400
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,060
Oh.

401
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,820
My bad.

402
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,300
That's what happens.

403
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,940
happens.

404
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,180
That's what happens.

405
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:42,580
Okay.

406
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,140
Okay, there we go.

407
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,740
World's worst architect.

408
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,120
Right, for real.

409
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,580
I guess this arrow is supposed to indicate that you look up,
huh?

410
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,620
They're like, hey, idiot.

411
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:07,080
There's a... It's the yellow gamer paint of the 90s.

412
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,400
They're like, Look up!

413
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,320
Look up!

414
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,520
Alright, let's see if I...

415
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,320
Whoa.

416
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,260
Where are we?

417
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,880
Oh, oh shoot.

418
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
What sound was that?

419
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,780
We are wanting to look...

420
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,450
Um...

421
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,350
To the right.

422
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,650
East?

423
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,200
That was west sound.

424
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,600
Okay, we want to look east.

425
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,750
in his house.

426
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,730
Why is there no visual?

427
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,150
Who invented this?

428
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,530
Where's the sound?

429
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,090
Oh, bunk.

430
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,210
Oh, gosh.

431
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,550
I can't remember the sounds at all.

432
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,170
Even back in the 90s, they apparently understood gamer
habits quite well.

433
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,670
Bunk.

434
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,390
Bunk was south.

435
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,090
It's south.

436
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:20,830
Bunk.

437
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,550
Okay.

438
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,430
Thank you, guys.

439
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,560
Sproing?

440
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,900
I thought Sproing was south.

441
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,940
Maybe I just never went south.

442
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,720
Is this east then?

443
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,440
Sproing is east.

444
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,760
All right, let's see.

445
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,940
It's an awfully quiet rotator, huh?

446
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,590
Like, everything else is so loud.

447
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,710
we're rotating the giant machine.

448
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,170
There's nothing.

449
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,030
Ah!

450
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,130
We made it!

451
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,550
To the other side.

452
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,110
What is this?

453
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,670
What?

454
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,170
Okay, I'll take a picture.

455
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,610
Okay, well, no, I don't need a picture.

456
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:30,350
The last two are three peaks and half moon.

457
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,390
Actually, I will take a picture.

458
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,630
Good soundproofing.

459
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:35,990
Yeah.

460
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:50,770
like yeah not twin peaks three peaks I took a picture so
it's okay wait so is there an island on the other side I

461
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,770
actually there has to be because well

462
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:06,360
not half maybe there's one behind because I don't remember I
don't remember seeing anything and

463
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
then I guess we also have to rotate

464
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
for the...

465
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,830
the telescope.

466
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:32,750
Oh, wait.

467
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,050
Oh, just kidding.

468
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,190
Yeah, this is what we're supposed to do.

469
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,090
Okay, uh...

470
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,240
I'll try rotating it to the...

471
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,080
north.

472
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:44,700
Wait.

473
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,380
Yeah, north?

474
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,240
And seeing if there's anything that was behind the island,
you know?

475
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Yep.

476
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,080
North!

477
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,500
Wait, that's north, right?

478
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,400
What the fuck?

479
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,800
All right.

480
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,400
Wait, that was south?

481
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,360
Oh, shh.

482
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,720
I see.

483
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,740
They sound so similar to me.

484
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,740
I mean, I guess I could have put in the two shapes that we
just got, but that's okay.

485
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,540
Okay.

486
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,260
Here.

487
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
No, I went too far, I think.

488
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,810
Sounds like a bomb is about to go off.

489
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,650
For real, though.

490
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,090
Alright.

491
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,820
Alright, let's see if there's anything here.

492
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,540
Excuse me, Miss.

493
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,180
I was right.

494
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,140
My intuition.

495
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,140
Yes, my intuition.

496
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,640
No!

497
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,300
Because I was like, I don't remember seeing anything over
here.

498
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,960
You can... Obviously, I saw this one, so I was like, maybe
it's behind us.

499
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,120
No, no, no, no, no.

500
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,160
Wait, I just noticed, like, the...

501
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,680
Alright, so then, let's go back.

502
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,700
Let's go back south.

503
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,960
We still need a blue page.

504
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,160
We'll find it somehow.

505
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,660
Intuition.

506
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,160
Why are you putting that in quotes, huh?

507
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,700
Do you doubt my genius?

508
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,440
Oh, wait.

509
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Do you doubt my...

510
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,660
I mean, look how big my head is.

511
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,240
There's got to be something in this noggin.

512
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,060
There's got to be something.

513
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,960
It's not totally rattling...

514
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,610
What's the sound?

515
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,170
No.

516
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,350
That's West.

517
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,650
Yes.

518
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,550
At least three brain cells in here.

519
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,390
This was the reason of gamers going bald in the 90s.

520
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,790
Maybe.

521
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,670
Technically, your head is empty since you're a ghost.

522
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:56,870
What?

523
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,690
I have plenty of actoplasm.

524
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,050
What do

525
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,820
you mean it's empty?

526
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,420
Oops.

527
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,840
Oh, please turn around.

528
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,350
There we go.

529
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,780
All right.

530
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,000
Let's go put in our symbols.

531
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,940
Phone.

532
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,360
Thank goodness I don't have to write notes.

533
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,380
Down.

534
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,100
and then like some ziggy zaggies.

535
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,020
Ziggy zaggies.

536
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,540
And then I think I remember it was the three peaks.

537
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,740
And then half a moon.

538
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,580
There isn't a right half, right?

539
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll double check.

540
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,000
No.

541
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,240
There's not.

542
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,840
Oh, I missed it again.

543
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,680
Oh.

544
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,610
8008.

545
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,850
Oh.

546
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,450
Baby?

547
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:57,710
Wait.

548
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:58,610
Eh.

549
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:00,890
Eh.

550
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:01,870
Eh.

551
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,030
Wait, home already?

552
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,190
No, no, no.

553
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,830
We haven't gotten the page!

554
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,150
Wait, we didn't get the page yet.

555
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,410
We have to go back.

556

559
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,590
I try to meet girls, meet people.

560
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,590

I don't remember making this promise, but probably that I
did.

566
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:17,830
Maybe.

567
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:18,510
Oh, wait.

568
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,130

00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,430
This one?

571
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,770
Yeah.

572
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,390
What is going on?

573
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,230
Hold on, one second.

574
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,030
My phone is bugging.

575
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,890
Oh, okay.

576
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,550
Okay.

577
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,390
I don't even know how to do Onesan voice.

578
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,630
I will try.

579
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,610
Oh, Blyback doesn't even have Onesan voice.

580
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,560
Ghost of meat.

581
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,100
Happy birthday.

582
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,400
Happy birthday!

583
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,920
Thank you again so much for the...

584
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,680
For the...

585
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,560
For the...

586
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,060
Akasupa, thank you!

587
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,160
Thank you, thank you.

588
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,700
Alrighty.

589
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,500
Let's figure out what's going on in here.

590
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,200
Okay, I think we need to...

591
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,060
Is it this one?

592
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,300
No, it's the other room.

593
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,320
I don't know if this has to do with

594
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,710
with the other island or not.

595
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:10,250
and then these telescope does not have to do any anything
with the pages okay thank you very much

596
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,460
i was wondering if it was gonna like that's why i was
wondering if it showed something with the island the thrones

597
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:34,680
hide a secret then i'm guessing this is the blue pages then
i'm assuming this This is the blue pages and then this is if

598
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,960
I want the red pages.

599
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,320
So let's uh, what the thrones?

600
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,740
What secrets do they hide?

601
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,160
Examine the thrones very carefully.

602
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,200
There's blood there.

603
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,840
I think I found it.

604
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,940
I think I found it.

605
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:28,700
Um, whoops.

606
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Hope you have a good time, Minto.

607
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,600
In fact, Marty O'Donnell worked on this and went to do the
music where Halo and Destiny are.

608
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,040
Wow, cool.

609
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,080
I found it!

610
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,140
I found it!

611
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,480
I found it!

612
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,120
What's this?

613
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,880
Oh.

614
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,180
Oh.

615
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that?

616
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,480
Where is that?

617
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:02,840
Oh.

618
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,870
Very, very.

619
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,750
Wait, I want to find the other one, too, then.

620
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,670
That's so funny.

621
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,390
Is it like one of these?

622
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:27,850
No.

623
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,970
There's this, but...

624
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,400
How do I...

625
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,480
Hmm.

626
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,980
Such a nice obedience cage.

627
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,380
At least Eustace isn't messed up.

628
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,120
Wait, but then there's also this.

629
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,660
I can't tell what's like a red herring, if anything.

630
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,240
You know?

631
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,900
Does his throne have it in a different location?

632
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm pointing and I'm clicking.

633
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,160
I'm playing the game.

634
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,400
Sure, we're still on Team Blue?

635
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,220
I might have like eaten my words as soon as...

636
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,340
Like, what the heck?

637
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,820
Mr. Man!

638
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, whoa, I didn't... Oh my god.

639
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,860
It's literally him!

640
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,160
Whoa!

641
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,480
I don't see it here, though.

642
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,320
Am I blind?

643
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,420
Wait.

644
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,100
Am I blind?

645
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,020
Is she blind?

646
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,440
Yes.

647
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:11,460
Why?

648
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,440
This one is slightly better hidden.

649
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,460
Tapestry?

650
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,440

Thank you.

657
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,100
We got our page.

658
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,500
I feel like we should go get the other pages real quick.

659
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,300
Are you guys ready for some quality?

660
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,300
144p television.

661
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,320
Here he comes.

662
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,290
I'm my friend.

663
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,950
I'll bring in the blue pages.

664
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,470
I see something.

665
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:41,610
Huh?

666
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:42,750
Convinced.

667
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,410
The Sirus is killed deeply.

668
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,070
Pray do not release him.

669
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:46,870
Sirus.

670
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,030
He will destroy me.

671
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,150
Just as he does.

672
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,470
The innocent bystander.

673
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,030
I've been wrongly tricked.

674
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,310
You don't poison me!

675
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,650
Not the filter.

676
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:01,630
The red filter.

677
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,270
I think you have a concern.

678
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,950
He's employed with lust for riches!

679
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,310
In the four remaining worlds.

680
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,490
Use and plot.

681
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,810
He was almost perfect!

682
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,370
Riches!

683
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,270
Although it was a father.

684
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,110
It took him into believing.

685
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,070
What kind of camera is he using?

686
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,550
Who was the murderer?

687
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,650
How did you murder father?

688
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,670
Bring me the remaining.

689
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,250
It's his leave.

690
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:39,970
He's using the pages.

691
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:43,270
iPhone 1.

692
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,910
This literal book camera.

693
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,010
Book camera.

694
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,930
From the last age of mischief.

695
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,210
I must be free.

696
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:54,550
Must be free.

697
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,630
Get up there here for eternity.

698
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:57,910
I must be free.

699
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:58,750
I must be free.

700
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:00,870
Free me.

701
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,310
This acting is like...

702
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,510
He's so like...

703
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:12,550
What

704
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,320
I'm gonna do is...

705
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,440
I'm gonna save this as like...

706
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,940
You guys... Okay, I know...

707
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,820
I think it was like what?

708
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,880
There was like...

709
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,600
Four different endings.

710
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,780
We always enjoy our quality with this guy.

711
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,220
Corona, welcome back.

712
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,100
Thank you.

713
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,000
Four endings.

714
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:48,160
I'm assuming one is if you do only the blue pages one is if
you do red only the red pages and one is if you do red and

715
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:56,420
blue pages maybe but i don't know what the last one would be
no pages

716
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:17,100
not necessarily i don't know i see one is if you get no
pages i see you're only locked into an ending at the very

717
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,920
end oh really wait so i could collect the red pages at this
very moment and it would be okay

718
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:36,400
uh where have we gone sorry where are we gone we've gotten
spaceship uh the red page let's go just let's just let's

719
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,280
just go wait

720
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,020
was the really awful one with the subway, right?

721
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,660
Locked in at the very, very end, so you don't need to worry.

722
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Okay, I should...

723
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,580
All right, we'll get it over with...

724
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,540
Whoops, that's not what I meant to do.

725
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,960
We'll just get it over with...

726
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,800
We'll just get it over with...

727
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:27,150
I'm like, all right, let's, I think it was the one over
here, right?

728
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:30,290
Yes.

729
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,350
I remember.

730
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:33,950
My big brain.

731
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:35,830
I remember.

732
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:37,950
I remember.

733
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,310
Oh, oops.

734
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,810
Yes, we're zooming?

735
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,610
Come on, get on with it!

736
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,010
Alrighty.

737
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,130
Here we go.

738
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,510
Here we go!

739
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,120
The loading between screens used to be so long.

740
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,480
I mean, back then.

741
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,940
It is actually, I feel like playing the game, like, or
rather, this feels playable, you know, compared to...

742
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:36,700
to back then when everything was like crazy loading times
and everything like it's just it's just nice thank you all

743
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,200
right you remember we members yeah

744
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:53,940
that's east is that east no wait no that's west i'm so sorry

745
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,120
I lied.

746
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,160
I remembered at the very last second.

747
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,300
Weast.

748
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,760
Weast.

749
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,680
Weast.

750
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,400
Thank you, everybody.

751
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,180
It's like playing BA on PC.

752
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,180
Really?

753
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,060
I played it once and it crashed and I've never touched it
again.

754
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,100
Maybe I should give it another try.

755
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,020
Did you guys...

756
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,540
If you played Blue Archive, did you pull for...

757
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,980
Sayya and did you pull for Hasumi?

758
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,220
South.

759
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,240
Is that the next one?

760
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:37,780
South?

761
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,140
We'll hear it in two seconds.

762
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,400
One, two.

763
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,000
No, that's east.

764
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,580
I didn't get Sayya.

765
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,360
I got extremely lucky with my pulls.

766
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,040
I did the first free pull.

767
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:03,980
I did the first free pull And then I always, like, do one of
my own jemmies, and I did that, and that's when I got Seya.

768
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,460
And then they had the free Tenpole ticket that they give you
as well for the anniversary, and I used that, and I got

769
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,920
Hasumi.

770
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,080
Like, immediately!

771
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:12,880
It was crazy!

772
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,820
That's East also, right?

773
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,660
Oh, we talking Saint Seya?

774
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,700
No!

775
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,780
That's South!

776
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,500
who are you polling for the other 90 polls more seya

777
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:59,220
i was laying in bed and i was doing my polls and when when
seya came i literally jumped up i was like this is unheard

778
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:13,460
of if you don't know me with gotcha luck i don't have any so
this is like unprecedented it's like craziness i went feral

779
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,200
for you

780
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:46,570
east or no west sorry i did it again i did it i did I did it
again!

781
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,670
I did it again!

782
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,450
Oops, I...

783
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,510
Did it again...

784
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,970
No!

785
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,570
Your luck is changing mint, it can't always be bad.

786
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,450
I don't know, I'm a ghost, so it's just kind of like...

787
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,270
Part of the...

788
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,970
Part of the equation.

789
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,410
I just pulled Seya!

790
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,290
Let's go!

791
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,520
Next?

792
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,850
Oh shoot, I forgot that.

793
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,670
Oh my god, wait.

794
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,570
What was it again?

795
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,730
South?

796
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,090
West?

797
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,850
Southwest?

798
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,190
Southeast.

799
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,170
Southwest?

800
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:41,710
Southwest?

801
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,790
I just pulled my back.

802
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,530
Okay, we gotta lock in.

803
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,030
Oh my god, the segment is so long.

804
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,510
So long.

805
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,310
Like it that you play older, forgotten games.

806
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:02,770
Really?

807
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:03,630
You think so?

808
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,110
I don't feel like Mist is forgotten, per se.

809
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:07,910
Wait, is this just one?

810
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,670
That's just West, right?

811
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,030
That's wrong.

812
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,490
Oops, I did it again.

813
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,290
You played with the horse.

814
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,650
Got lost in the game.

815
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:30,790
I have to remember that drippy sound is west and sproingy
sound is east.

816
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,050
Old but not forgotten.

817
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,870
I think I missed this.

818
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,130
What?

819
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,890
That's northwest.

820
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,480
I see we are using technical terms, sproingy and drippy.

821
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,540
Are we almost there?

822
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,320
Is this it?

823
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,340
Is this the end?

824
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,600
Oh my god.

825
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:12,520
Northeast.

826
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,140
Zumbinis was such a goaded stream.

827
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,840
Oh my gosh, I missed Zumbinis so much.

828
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,560
Honestly, it's still one of my favorite streams that I've
done because I was just...

829
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,220
I was just so happy to play it.

830
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,880
I was just so happy to play Zumbinis!

831
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,500
Because I had been wanting to stream it for so long.

832
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,640
Because it really was like my favorite childhood game.

833
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,160
You're not fleens.

834
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,660
You're not fleens.

835
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,460
Well, whatever you are.

836
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,280
Make me a pizza.

837
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh, Hamidou.

838
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,060
That's Southeast.

839
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,540
Make me a pizza.

840
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,960
So that's why I chose it as one of the first games that I
started.

841
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,720
once I got back.

842
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,120
Oh, I was so happy.

843
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,620
We made it.

844
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,600
Gosh, this was so stinking long.

845
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,900
The studio made a new game called Abduction some years ago
that's worth checking out if you want a more modern take.

846
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,280
Of Zumbinis?

847
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,300
Or of Mist?

848
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,340
Thanks for being here, but enjoy me.

849
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,220
Don't thank you, Sunday girl.

850
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,860
Thank you.

851
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,420
Zumbinis 2?

852
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,300
Nah, missed.

853
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,500
Well, why not more Zumbinis?

854
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,800
Why not?

855
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,880
Why can't we have more Zumbinis?

856
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,780
Oh my gosh, I'm so used to...

857
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,040
This is a hidey hole.

858
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,100
Right?

859
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,340
For someone's trying to kill me.

860
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,640
Maybe.

861
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,380
Serious?

862
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,500
Perhaps?

863
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,320
Try Princess, thank you!

864
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,360
I have returned.

865
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,640
Thank you for bringing me back.

866
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,260
You're welcome.

867
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,060
I see so much more like... legible.

868
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,760
You must continue to help me.

869
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,820
I must continue to help you.

870
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,680
My name is Ceres.

871
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,780
Hi Ceres.

872
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,520
I beg you to find me.

873
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,540
Remain Red Pages.

874
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,040
You must read.

875
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,240
He seems like such an...

876
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,930
To become what?

877
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,810
Release you from the book to become what?

878
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,530
I need more Red Pages.

879
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,610
I need more.

880
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,190
Why do they sound like this?

881
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,310
Don't waste time.

882
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:38,770
Don't...

883
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,550
That's what he just is like, I must go stream on my...

884
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,070
My brother.

885
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,390
Your brother?

886
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,410
What about him?

887
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:49,390
I like that guy.

888
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,770
He used to...

889
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,310
You didn't even...

890
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,570
Oh.

891
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,490
Oh, he is the one who is wrongfully imprisoned.

892
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,390
Bring the red page to me.

893
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,430
I just pulled Zaya.

894
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,450
Let's go, scuba!

895
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,570
Imagine if my lore video was like this.

896
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,690
I could just...

897
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:25,510
I imagine I could just see the viewership, like, dropping
and dropping and dropping.

898
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:30,850
We've gotten three pages, but I cannot remember.

899
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,090
We did the spaceship.

900
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,310
We did...

901
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,990
Oh, the gear?

902
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,010
And then we did this house.

903
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,090
Okay, now I remember.

904
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:41,770
I'm stupid.

905
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,130
to time this again.

906
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,150
No.

907
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:49,750
The tree.

908
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:50,430
Yeah, yeah.

909
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:51,950
I don't want to time.

910
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,470
Okay, let's go to the gear.

911
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,860
Fire that puppy up.

912
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,450
I've played golf in VR here.

913
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:19,450
I bet it's a really good golf map.

914
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:20,290
I bet.

915
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:21,850
Oh, uh, my bad.

916
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,430
Oh, la la la la la la la la la.

917
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,290
No, I should have gone the other way.

918
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:29,590
Okay, la la la.

919
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,390
Inside your riches.

920
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,530
I don't, I'm not interested in any of that.

921
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,210
Who am I?

922
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:35,530
Wait.

923
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,870
Sirius, your greed sickens me.

924
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:45,250
Your desire for wealth and plunder is never satisfied.

925
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,870
I will instruct my subjects not to pay your new tax.

926
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,910
And you know they'll listen to me.

927
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:54,010
Regards.

928
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,430
Eustace.

929
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,990
Your greed sickens me.

930
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,230
Sickening, sickening.

931
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:03,830
Greed.

932
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:04,290
Greed.

933
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,850
Never-ending greed.

934
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,690
I'm glad I caught that.

935
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,710
I keep going the wrong way.

936
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,550
I'm so sorry, guys.

937
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:16,150
Oh, my gosh.

938
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,150
Wait, did I just go the wrong way?

939
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,710
Just went the opposite way now.

940
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,850
Wait, what is the with the bird then?

941
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:22,850

942
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:37,500

Bring me a green page.

945
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,940
Trust other wisps.

946
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,660
Wait.

947
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:02,080
Oh.

948
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,160
I think I just closed it.

949
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,460
Open.

950
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:13,470
In.

951
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:14,010
In.

952
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:15,810
Go.

953
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,450
Green pages.

954
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:19,350
Only green.

955
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,110
Only green.

956
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:22,890
Only green.

957
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:23,690
Only green.

958
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,390
All right.

959
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,340
Have returned.

960
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,360
What

961
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,740
are you saying?

962
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,520
My prison on this forgotten island of Mist.

963
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,940
I see that you are...

964
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,660
I'm wet.

965
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,990
I know your name.

966
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,620
I see that you are Minto.

967
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,560
You are green.

968
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,700
Red and green.

969
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Christmas!

970
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,280
Don't touch the blue pages.

971
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,100
Don't touch the blue pages.

972
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,860
For my wicked brother.

973
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,860
Akano.

974
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,220
Akano.

975
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:34,380
Akano.

976
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,700
The wicked brother Akano.

977
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,880
He is a man of distorted mind and senses.

978
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,940
He disgusts me.

979
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,140
Why is he acting like this?

980
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,560
Do not release Akano.

981
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,360
Thirst for destruction is nigh.

982
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,740
Never ending.

983
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,180
Bring it to red paper.

984
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,780
Where are these guys now?

985
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,420
Can you please release me from this prison?

986
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:09,600
Okay.

987
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,100
Oh god.

988
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,460
Quite honestly, neither of them seem trustworthy.

989
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,560
Yeah, the actors.

990
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,260
Where are the actors at, I wonder?

991
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,160
Um, okay, let me save real quick.

992
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,940
I'll just save over Blue Pages team.

993
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,380
Oh, resume, there we go.

994
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,460
Um, what was the last thing?

995
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:48,900
The ship?

996
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,140
Is that what we need to do?

997
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:53,620
The sunken ship.

998
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:07,020
Which we, I have pictures, I believe, of, uh, yeah, of the
times that, the times and dates that I was given?

999
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:18,590
And I have the pictures of those the constellations.

1000
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:23,090
And the red page in the forest.

1001
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,110
Yeah, I know.

1002
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,790
I just don't want to go get it.

1003
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,010
I'm lazy.

1004
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,250
Oh, whoops.

1005
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:28,670
My bad.

1006
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:29,710
I'm lazy.

1007
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:31,790
Ugh.

1008
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,130
Oh, it's not even on.

1009
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,770
Oh my gosh.

1010
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,150
I have to relight it.

1011
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,390
Wait, where'd he go?

1012
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,410
Oh, there we go, okay.

1013
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,330
Okay, we needed to go high up.

1014
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:06,150
Actors are Robin and Rand Miller, two brothers, who are also
in the main developers of the game and in charge of...

1015
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,510
Whoa, that's so cool!

1016
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,800
Maybe that's enough.

1017
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,020
Yes?

1018
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:23,520
Okay.

1019
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,740
Now it should be going up, up, up.

1020
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:31,450
It's going up, up, up!

1021
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:32,370
Maybe.

1022
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:33,990
Oh!

1023
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,010
Wait, is it already up?

1024
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,160
I don't know.

1025
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,320
Is it up at the top?

1026
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:51,580
Oh!

1027
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:55,960
Okay.

1028
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,410
Maybe I should add more gas, gas, gas.

1029
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,750
Hurry up, please.

1030
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,290
Hurry up, please.

1031
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:19,590
Hurry up, please.

1032
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,510
Okay, there it is.

1033
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:28,630
We'll let it get a little bit higher so that I'm not
scrambling to get inside.

1034
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,210
Gas, gas, gas.

1035
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,850
Gas, gas.

1036
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,510
Alright, keep going, keep going!

1037
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,130
Go in, no no, not yet, not yet, not yet.

1038
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,430
I'm gonna let it get to like off the screen at least.

1039
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:58,070
Off the screen at least, alright.

1040
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:07,570
I gave it a lot of gas though.

1041
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,110
You think it'll be okay?

1042
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,310
You think it'll be okay?

1043
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:14,870
I gave it so much gas.

1044
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,500
Does it come down really?

1045
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,280
Okay, let's go.

1046
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:41,920
Squeakers, squeakin, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1047
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,420
Squeakers and squeakin.

1048
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,820
Oh, po po po po po.

1049
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,200
Go, go, go!

1050
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,500
Oh my gosh.

1051
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,600
Go in!

1052
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:03,660
Nice.

1053
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,360
Okay, now we just gotta go grab that page.

1054
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,000
We can come back.

1055
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,520
I don't remember where this one was, though.

1056
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,620
Like, I vaguely remember?

1057
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,340
Can I get three big booms?

1058
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,360
Boom!

1059
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:20,920
Boom!

1060
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:21,480
Boom!

1061
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,920
Ah, yes, my swamp is.

1062
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,560
ASMR.

1063
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,480
My swamp.

1064
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,360
ASMR.

1065
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,940
Alright, it was somewhere amongst the trees.

1066
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,400
I don't remember.

1067
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,230
Do you guys remember?

1068
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,770
Did I have to go up more?

1069
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:51,990
Uh.

1070
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,050
Oh shoot.

1071
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,170
For some reason I was like, this will be so easy, I'll
remember.

1072
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,290
I have to go higher.

1073
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,150
Where's the next...

1074
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,750
Oh, wait.

1075
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,190
Was the elevator right next to me?

1076
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,310
It was right next to me, wasn't it?

1077
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,090
Oh, shoot.

1078
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:11,770
How do I get back home?

1079
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:14,550
Um...

1080
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,910
Uh...

1081
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,450
Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.

1082
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,660
Okay, at least it wasn't too far.

1083
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:52,870
At least it was very close, actually.

1084
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,900
Only one pump to change.

1085
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:02,880
Yeah, it's not so bad.

1086
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,740
All right, now we go to his fancy, fancy room.

1087
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,700
Squillium fancy pants over here.

1088
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,700
No, that's the ungabunga room.

1089
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,400
That's not the right room either.

1090
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,560
It's...

1091
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:17,760
Oops.

1092
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,340
It's the one over here.

1093
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,240
And his was in here.

1094
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:28,360
Here.

1095
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,860
No.

1096
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,280
Just kidding.

1097
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,460
It was, uh...

1098
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,140
And he... here!

1099
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:34,720
Yes.

1100
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,600
Yes, yes, yes.

1101
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,020
Yes, I never forget.

1102
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,060
I'm like an elephant.

1103
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,760
I never forget.

1104
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,600
Make a note of that note.

1105
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,120
Oh, yeah.

1106
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,580
I think I took a picture of it.

1107
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,860
I'm almost positive I did.

1108
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,040
Yeah, I took a picture of that note.

1109
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,020
Alright.

1110
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,360
Back down.

1111
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:13,080
stars and then i think i need to redo that and then it was
like over here or something that i go around

1112
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,440
yes yes

1113
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:32,520
yes so would you play the sequel after this i'll think about
it it's definitely not off the table though I don't see why

1114
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:49,680
not why did fart at me okay awesome guys we made it back now
we are three for three on both pages on both books

1115
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:05,340
for each page I can see more clearly Free from this horrible
prison.

1116
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,000
Oh.

1117
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,320
You must visit the one remaining eight.

1118
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,540
Because you have not the confidence that they're doing.

1119
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,960
Yeah, I've heard a lot of people say that ribbon is, like,
so much more difficult.

1120
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,880
And my brother Akana is invented.

1121
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,560
I'm going to let that guy free.

1122
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,040
I took advantage of the freedom of father and given us.

1123
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,640
I never knew that this game had a story, though.

1124
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:41,420
What did you say?

1125
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,460
Speak up, Sirius.

1126
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
Why so Sirius?

1127
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:57,500
He will destroy both myself and me.

1128
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,060
Just as he destroyed.

1129
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,490
What's this about you murdering your friends?

1130
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,210
either.

1131
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:29,060
Imagine, like, you know when you're trying to, like, fix the
reception on a TV, like an old-timey TV, you had to move

1132
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,460
the...

1133
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,200
What's wrong with your face?

1134
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,140
You have to move the antenna around.

1135
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,700
Imagine you're just, like, trying to find the signal.

1136
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,400
You have to move the page around.

1137
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:45,710
Alright, quit yapping, Sirius.

1138
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:46,730
Let me go down with it.

1139
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:58,270
life and you will be riches beyond my wildest dreams
probably not this guy would give me like a nickel

1140
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:14,930
maybe all right let's save again so i don't have to do all
of this stuff perfect okay now i have some constellations we

1141
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,910
are trying to do something with this boat

1142
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,700
I don't think there's anything else to do in here.

1143
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:35,720
I think so.

1144
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,500
Marker switch, water turbulent pool.

1145
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,400
No, I don't think so.

1146
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:43,680
Hmm.

1147
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,060
There's also these.

1148
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,060
And this.

1149
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,740
What if I just grabbed it and pulled it up?

1150
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,280
Hmm.

1151
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,360
Is that a ladder?

1152
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,820
Did you see one?

1153
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,920
See green!

1154
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,680
Green, green!

1155
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,420
The library?

1156
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:15,620
Oh, that's right!

1157
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,640
There were... Oh, gosh, okay.

1158
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,920
Okay, I'm just gonna skip through.

1159
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:21,900
I'm sorry, guys.

1160
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,700
I don't think... I don't think my throat has it in it to
read all of these pages.

1161
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,740
I really apologize.

1162
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,800
Because they're so long.

1163
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,140
Oh, okay, just kidding.

1164
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:42,900
In fact, as I say that, I'm going to put in a throat mint.

1165
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,140
For myself.

1166
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,160
Okay.

1167
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,150
This is Papa.

1168
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,670
Okay, this is the spaceship.

1169
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,450
We have these nanograms, and there's many pages of them.

1170
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,330
like 30 of them or something.

1171
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:14,310
Cannibalism!

1172
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:16,190
No.

1173
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,190
This, I think, is it.

1174
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:27,170
As for the boat, I can see the boys enjoying it anyway.

1175
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:28,910
And with that, I am pleased.

1176
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,110
They have played on it all day.

1177
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,650
Even though the boat cannot move, I have enjoyed studying
from it.

1178
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:35,410
It is much sturdier platform than the jagged rocks.

1179
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:40,350
In the course of my observations, I have learned some very
interesting things regarding the solar system of this age.

1180
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:40,910
Okay, here we go.

1181
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:44,170
Nice or beautiful, constellations.

1182
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,870
Mm-hmm.

1183
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,240
Sorry.

1184
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,640
Oh, 300!

1185
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,440
300!

1186
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,820
Keep going to the end.

1187
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,740
Lighthouse.

1188
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,000
There's not a lighthouse here.

1189
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:15,180
It was Will who first saw the girl.

1190
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,780
She was swimming not far from the boat where Will was...

1191
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:18,400
Who was Will?

1192
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,120
Then Will noticed a man not far away from the girl.

1193
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,700
Emmett was very pleased to meet the additional neighbors.

1194
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:30,300
Oh, I guess maybe in the Stone Ship Age.

1195
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,480
Ten years since I left this age, which I've called the Stone
Ship Age.

1196
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:35,820
Aw.

1197
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,120
That has been kept in perfect condition.

1198
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:39,560
Ah!

1199
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,580
Here we go.

1200
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,500
Okay.

1201
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,740
Maybe the corresponding constellations are the things that I
light up green.

1202
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,720
That is my guesstimation at the moment.

1203
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,220
And we have three of them.

1204
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,780
Which I have pictures of on my phone that I am currently
viewing.

1205
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,080
But it is not this one.

1206
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,040
Let's see.

1207
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,480
It's not the eyeball.

1208
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,900
Please be the snake.

1209
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,780
Guys, it's the snake!

1210
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,060
Okay, snake?

1211
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:15,900
Yes.

1212
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,080
Snake?

1213
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,760
Snake is January 17th time.

1214
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:25,660
Oh my god!

1215
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,380
I manifested it.

1216
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:29,560
Let's see.

1217
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,500
Um, little buggy.

1218
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,700
Little buggy!

1219
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,980
Little buggy is November.

1220
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:37,760
Little buggy.

1221
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,380
Little buggy is November 23rd.

1222
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:48,020
I don't know if I need to keep track of the dates or not,
but it's helping me with what I already knocked out.

1223
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,000
Okay, not the cross, not the arrow, not the flamingo.

1224
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:56,340
Leaf!

1225
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,800
Leaf is October 11th.

1226
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,020
Okay.

1227
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:01,960
Very buggy.

1228
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,180
Snake!

1229
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,140
Okay, let's go outside.

1230
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:07,920
How do I do?

1231
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,440
Okay, there we go.

1232
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:17,420
So, if I do snake green and which one's a little buggy, not
Not eyeball.

1233
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,340
Little buggy, green.

1234
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,960
Ooh, not flamingo.

1235
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,220
Leaf.

1236
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,860
Oh my god!

1237
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,980
Thank you guys for reminding me about the book in the
library.

1238
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,120
Wow!

1239
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,200
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

1240
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,700
Oh, that's so cool.

1241
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:05,440
Whoa.

1242
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
I'm the captain of this ship.

1243
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,420
Wow, there's nothing in here.

1244
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,460
This area is...

1245
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,660
Oh, there's the lighthouse.

1246
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,460
Why is it under the water, though?

1247
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,560
Do we have to lift it as well, like the boat?

1248
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,920
What an odd rule.

1249
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:38,480
room is that where he was he was like i like doing my
studies on the on the boat but it's like oh i guess he meant

1250
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:54,350
these jagged rocks huh okay i am a i am a telescope that
only goes left and right

1251
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,450
very cool

1252
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:15,070
can i okay maybe i cannot what's in here Darkness.

1253
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,430
Uh, up here?

1254
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:23,150
This is where I came from, no?

1255
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,330
Oh, it's now it's all covered in water.

1256
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:27,930
This age is so fine, is it?

1257
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:28,890
I'm excited.

1258
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:30,110
Let's see still.

1259
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,730
Oh.

1260
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,310
What did I do?

1261
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,400
And what's in here?

1262
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,200
Oh!

1263
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,540
Oh.

1264
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,420
Okay.

1265
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,120
Oh.

1266
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,500
Does it need to unlock that?

1267
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:52,360
Interesting.

1268
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,460
The key.

1269
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,240
Alright, well it didn't lower the water in there.

1270
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,140
What about... Oh wait, there is no water here.

1271
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,640
What is this thing right here?

1272
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:12,060
It looks like I should be able to interact with it, though.

1273
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,440
The water here.

1274
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,760
I don't know what it's doing.

1275
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,940
How many games until the end of the year?

1276
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,480
Oh, I would have to check.

1277
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:37,100
I do not know off the top of my head, sorry.

1278
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,020
Oh!

1279
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,380
It did raise the water!

1280
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:42,820
It did!

1281
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,200
It did!

1282
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,760
Wait, oh, shoot.

1283
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,540
Okay.

1284
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,360
I was like, I think it raises the water somewhere.

1285
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,860
Alright, alright.

1286
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,020
So what if we max it?

1287
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,890
I hear it.

1288
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,310
How are you?

1289
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,340
It looks like there's something in here.

1290
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,860
No, you guys would be very wrong about your answer.

1291
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:26,620
If

1292
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:37,370
I go back and there's stairs.

1293
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,890
Oh, now it lets me down.

1294
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:39,570
Okay, okay.

1295
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:49,190
So maybe now this will float because I just let the water
out.

1296
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,590
All right, now we raise the water again.

1297
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,310
I'm pretty confident in my answer.

1298
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,610
Nope, it's not here.

1299
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:16,490
Oh,

1300
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,550
there's...

1301
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,130
Did I need to turn the handle?

1302
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:28,890
Valve's still open.

1303
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,110
Oh, but nothing's coming out.

1304
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:32,770
Oh, maybe because it was...

1305
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,950
Wait, which was closed and which was open?

1306
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,750
Oh, wait.

1307
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:39,650
This is closed.

1308
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:40,950
Right?

1309
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:44,330
It's closed now.

1310
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,210
Okay, now it's good.

1311
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:48,890
Oh, my gosh.

1312
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:55,650
They're just like, hey, doofus, what do you think would
happen if you...

1313
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:56,150
Oh!

1314
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,250
Oh!

1315
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,010
Another key!

1316
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,230
Oh!

1317
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:05,870
Oh!

1318
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:09,770
I'm upstairs.

1319
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:10,910
What is this?

1320
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,450
A bomb?

1321
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,910
Wait, um...

1322
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,010
I'm a little nervous.

1323
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,480
I'm a little... It's green?

1324
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,060
Oh, but it's going down.

1325
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,340
Wait, is this really a bomb?

1326
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,440
It looks like I'm charging something.

1327
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,540
Yeah, like a battery.

1328
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,180
Yeah.

1329
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,290
Okay, full charge!

1330
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,690
Oh, to what?

1331
01:29:55,210 --> 01:30:00,950
I'm like trying to see if I could touch anything but it
doesn't seem like it.

1332
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,630
Alright, I'm gonna crank it some more.

1333
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,510
We're cranking it.

1334
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:07,550
All right, full charge.

1335
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:08,850
I'm gonna leave.

1336
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,220
Oh!

1337
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,560
Oh!

1338
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,140
Oh!

1339
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:16,620
Oh!

1340
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,080
Oh!

1341
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:17,360
Oh!

1342
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:17,720
Oh!

1343
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,280
Oh, it's scary in here.

1344
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:25,960
Wait, it's real.

1345
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,060
Oh, I don't like it.

1346
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:27,980
Oh, my God.

1347
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,000
Get me out of here.

1348
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:31,940
Okay.

1349
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:43,130
Is there a way that I can get rid of this water?

1350
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,870
I don't think the buttons worked.

1351
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:47,390
I think I remember trying to press them.

1352
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:49,870
And they didn't do anything.

1353
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:55,050
I don't want to go back down in here, though.

1354
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,850
I'm scared.

1355
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,430
The buttons do work.

1356
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:01,110
Oh, they do?

1357
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:10,370
Maybe something in there will activate the one of the
buttons drains those tunnels.

1358
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,600
Middle button.

1359
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,840
Middle button it is.

1360
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,180
Sorry if me zooming around is a little disorienting, guys.

1361
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,820
Okay, here we go.

1362
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,780
Maybe there's a button in here that will Turn on the lights
in the other room.

1363
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,020
Whoa.

1364
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,960
Oh, okay.

1365
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,400
We know whose room this is.

1366
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,640
Peels.

1367
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:40,980
Peels here.

1368
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:42,900
Okay.

1369
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,020
Is that what he used to kill their dad?

1370
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,200
Probably.

1371
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,420
What a freak.

1372
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,360
That guy is.

1373
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,320
Look at this bed.

1374
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,500
This absolute opulence.

1375
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:57,880
Oh, my God.

1376
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:19,720
god oh okay cool shut that oh okay oh my gosh okay red page
but i don't know how to go home yet oh my god oh this scared

1377
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,800
me i thought i was running out of power how

1378
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,890
much power do we have left oh we were so good.

1379
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,450
Classy tableware.

1380
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:40,450
For the classiest of men.

1381
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:44,450
You escape so fast.

1382
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,970
I was so scared!

1383
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,550
Okay, we cranking it.

1384
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:51,890
We'll go back now.

1385
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:55,030
We'll go back to Sirus's room.

1386
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,350
Why is his room in like the bunker bunker though?

1387
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,800
What?

1388
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:21,040
So if you care to find me, look to the western sky.

1389
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,660
What the hell does that mean?

1390
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,320
As someone told me lately.

1391
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,900
What?

1392
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,620
What purpose could this serve?

1393
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,560
Imagine you go to the store.

1394
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,900
I think I would be sold on it, too, though.

1395
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,000
Think about it.

1396
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,360
Mispredicted VTubers.

1397
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,320
I want to go...

1398
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,060
You think so?

1399
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:06,320
I was watching the Defunct Land video the other day.

1400
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,500
About, like...

1401
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,400
The character, you know, there's, they have it now.

1402
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:18,140
It's called, like, Turtle Talk, and then there's, like, one
where you can talk to Stitch, too.

1403
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,960
But, like, truly, they have, Disney invented VTubers.

1404
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,460
Disney's the one that started it, I fear.

1405
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,880
I just want to keep clicking on this guy.

1406
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:47,780
If you don't know what, if you haven't watched the video,
basically, like I don't want the power to go out basically

1407
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:58,120
there was like a little room where you could go and talk to
Stitch and like some guy was controlling like the facial

1408
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:07,920
motions and it wasn't like a like a you know a camera or
anything he had like a joystick and was like like a

1409
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,280
controller and was like using the joystick to look up and
over and, like, also using the buttons to control, like, the

1410
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:26,140
facial expressions, um, which is, I mean, my face is my own,
so I control my own face, but, um, totally have not seen

1411
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:31,540
that being done with, uh, you know, VTubers before, ever.

1412
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,180
No, it's everybody, it's their own face.

1413
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,600
Yeah, puppeteering, exactly.

1414
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:44,400
And so, um, uh, and so, did I get this right?

1415
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,320
Yeah, okay.

1416
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:50,440
Yeah, it was basically just like a meet and greet with a
V-Tuber.

1417
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,120
It was so funny.

1418
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,140
Okay, let's go crank it again.

1419
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,240
I'm cranking it in the lighthouse!

1420
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,020
Okay, we're not even like...

1421
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,380
Dang, this thing is generous.

1422
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,320
Minto is a Muppet.

1423
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:09,840
No!

1424
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,940
If I were a Muppet, put me on a game of wars.

1425
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:20,160
It's so funny how many people get angry about Miss Piggy
being there.

1426
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:24,440
Does that mean we're all technically Disney adults?

1427
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:24,920
Maybe.

1428
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:26,880
Maybe, maybe.

1429
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,500
Is there something in this room that I'm like supposed to...

1430
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,840
Maybe there's something that I'm supposed to press.

1431
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,120
Oh my god, it sounds so icky.

1432
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,520
Please let there be a light switch.

1433
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,060
Somewhere, light switch.

1434
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,400
Light switch?

1435
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,780
Light switch.

1436
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,860
I'm missing something.

1437
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:53,180
Okay, definitely figured that was the case.

1438
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,510
Did I know what to do with this yet?

1439
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,750
Oh, nothing, apparently.

1440
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:05,490
Uh, how did I...

1441
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:06,910
Oh, yeah, I click and drag.

1442
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:07,430
That's right.

1443
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:09,370
Can I go the other way?

1444
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:30,810
10 20 30 40 50 60 80 90 100 110 what was that 120 130 what

1445
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:45,960
if they put a jump scare in here that'd be horrible oh fine
there's also like over here

1446
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,380
That...

1447
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,440
What is... wait.

1448
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,780
Oh, I have been there.

1449
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,000
Oh, those are the buttons.

1450
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:55,840
Okay, just kidding.

1451
01:37:58,940 --> 01:37:59,640
That's these.

1452
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,580
Okay, okay, okay.

1453
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,660
Yeah, the pump station.

1454
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,280
What?

1455
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,980
What could there be?

1456
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:14,160
Time for me to be a gamer and look up.

1457
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:18,580
Hmm.

1458
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,380
Take it slow on the stairs down to Saris's room.

1459
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:24,080
I did actually...

1460
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:24,400
Whoops.

1461
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,040
I did think about that.

1462
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,600
So, I was like, maybe I'm going too fast.

1463
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,960
Maybe there's something here.

1464
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:34,640
Okay.

1465
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:40,710
Okay, that just turned me around.

1466
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:42,970
Wait a second.

1467
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,050
There's nothing there.

1468
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,750
Wait.

1469
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:50,270
That just turned me around.

1470
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:52,050
Okay.

1471
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:52,670
Oh!

1472
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:56,430
Oh, I did.

1473
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:58,050
Oh.

1474
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:01,050
Oh.

1475
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:01,610
Oh.

1476
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:02,990
Whoa.

1477
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:03,670
Whoa.

1478
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,200
Oh, wait.

1479
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:08,820
No, no.

1480
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:09,380
Uh, uh.

1481
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:21,420
Huh?

1482
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:23,840
I'm not trying to leave.

1483
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:29,250
I'm trying to, like, go down here.

1484
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:35,610
Oh!

1485
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:39,390
I lit it up.

1486
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,480
Oh.

1487
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:49,580
Something is illuminating in the water.

1488
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:56,460
Wait, what did I do?

1489
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:58,630
Did

1490
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,940
she get that first try?

1491
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:07,460
Was there something special about it?

1492
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,500
Oh, oh, don't touch anything else.

1493
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:30,310
Guys, what have I told you that I'm a genius or why?

1494
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,510
What have I told you?

1495
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:36,370
Oh wait, actually that should light up his room.

1496
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:39,950
Okay, let's go crank it.

1497
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,110
That should...

1498
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:41,910
Yeah, yeah.

1499
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:43,730
Let's go crank it.

1500
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:53,290
That part gave me nightmares as a kid because pressing the
wrong one makes a loud sound.

1501
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,430
No way!

1502
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,990
Wait, out of all of those?

1503
01:40:57,650 --> 01:41:00,430
How did I get the right one first try?

1504
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:03,730
How?

1505
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:07,010
I think I am a secret genius.

1506
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:08,950
I'm a secret genius!

1507
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:10,350
Oh, here we go.

1508
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:11,050
Okay, nice.

1509
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,290
Alright.

1510
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:16,370
Ew.

1511
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,370
Whoa.

1512
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:22,350
We found the book to go home.

1513
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:24,410
Okay, bye.

1514
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:30,410

1518
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:04,310

1519
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,730
I didn't even know.

1520
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,510
It was a puzzle.

1521
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:14,150
I just did it.

1522
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,770
Okay.

1523
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:19,390
Come on.

1524
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:23,610
Telescope was the hint to the solution.

1525
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:24,570
That's what I figured!

1526
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:25,530
Oh.

1527
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:28,710
You finally discovered.

1528
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:35,990
I owe you a debt of gratitude for you have nearly My name is
Sirius.

1529
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:36,930
Yeah, I know.

1530
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:46,310
I trust that from your explorations, you become convinced
that my wicked brother, Akanah, is guilty, and I am

1531
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:46,450
innocent.

1532
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:47,070
No.

1533
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,650
It is I who am wrongly imprisoned here.

1534
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:52,570
Prisoned by my father.

1535
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:54,810
You pranked that soldier boy first, Trump.

1536
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:57,550
I don't know who you are or how you came to this country.

1537
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:58,670
I don't know either.

1538
01:42:58,910 --> 01:43:01,690
You must at least know something at the point.

1539
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:11,670
whose father was a master of the books he wrote hundreds of
all describing and linking to the fantastic places and ages

1540
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:21,350
which he had discovered the room in which you now stand was
our father's library yeah it was here in this room on this

1541
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:36,170
island named Mist that he housed most of his books but such
a waste now discovered that Akanah has burnt you to the

1542
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:36,650
innermost.

1543
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,720
Our father was always watchful of our explorations.

1544
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:48,840
We grew up under his strict supervision.

1545
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:55,620
But when we came of age, he gave us unbridled access to the
mystic books.

1546
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,940
He began to leave our adventures more and more unchecked.

1547
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:06,040
Unsupervised as we were, my brother began to become
disturbed.

1548
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:17,140
He began to take more from the mist ages than he had given
him soon reigned a twisted pleasure from the conquest and

1549
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:26,760
destruction why does nose go like that okay Pinocchio
telling lies huh uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

1550
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:37,780
he had completely destroyed all of the mist ages I wasted no
time.

1551
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,480
In warning, my father, I thought he would work away from the
camera.

1552
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:53,280
But in a fit of rage, he imprisoned both my brother and
myself within the pages of these books designed to hold us

1553
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,260
until he could judge which of us was killed.

1554
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:58,240
Yeah, but I thought the father was dead.

1555
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:58,940
Discover the truth.

1556
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,800
Our father embarked on one final adventure.

1557
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:02,620
Oh.

1558
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,280
However, he has never returned.

1559
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,120
Oh.

1560
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:14,160
I can only assume that he perished along the way, leaving
me, an innocent victim and trapped forever.

1561
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:19,980
But now, you are here to release me.

1562
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,800
Listen carefully.

1563
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:22,380
Okay.

1564
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:26,560
You must find one more page, and I will be forever free.

1565
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,780
There is a book on the shelves.

1566
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:34,720
This library, which is mostly burned, but has a few pages
still intact.

1567
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:35,380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1568
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:36,120

Let's head back to the ship world.

1577
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,080
I didn't see where it was, though.

1578
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,220
We're going to have to find it.

1579
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:05,740
And then I'll start doing, then I'll start doing separate
saves for the other endings.

1580
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:11,280
Are the other, are the other endings like long or anything
or?

1581
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,500
Actually, it's pink.

1582
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,900
dokey dokey let's go crank it in the lighthouse

1583
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:31,490
green book not really okay cool

1584
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:45,040
oh not enough you're very close to the end this is wow this
game took me years to figure out with a little help from

1585
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:55,060
chat you've nailed it in two streams i know somehow thank
you guys for all your help you've really been You've been,

1586
01:47:55,240 --> 01:48:04,780
uh, I feel you guys have been really good about, um, not
giving me direct answers, just, uh, you, sometimes,

1587
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:09,340
sometimes you do, but, about helping me with, like, little
directions.

1588
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:23,460
I always thought this game would be impossible for me to
complete, you know, like, when you're a baby, it's just

1589
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:28,160
like, sometimes these games are, like, They feel...

1590
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,770
I feel like it's gotta be in there, no?

1591
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,600
There's another...

1592
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,400
No!

1593
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,420
The lie is off!

1594
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,600
Oh, how annoying.

1595
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,920
There is another passage.

1596
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,400
You're just going to the same...

1597
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,420
Going down the same...

1598
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,300
I tried!

1599
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,440
I really did try!

1600
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,400
It wouldn't let me!

1601
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:13,480
Am I crazy?

1602
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,320
Alright, let's try again.

1603
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:19,460
So...

1604
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:20,700
Wait, where is it?

1605
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:20,940
Here.

1606
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,700
Oh my gosh, how are you supposed to see that?

1607
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,520
Like this?

1608
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:33,200
Which one was it?

1609
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:33,560
Like this?

1610
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,840
Oh, it does make a big noise.

1611
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,030
Oh, it's scary.

1612
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:44,270
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

1613
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:45,210
Oh, scary.

1614
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:50,870
Oh, that's scary.

1615
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:53,590
Oh, I'm glad I saw what happens, though.

1616
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:54,250
That's freaky.

1617
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:54,890
Oh, my gosh.

1618
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:56,110
That would give me nightmares, too.

1619
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,710
Graphics in this game were amazing in 1993.

1620
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,930
Yeah, I could believe it.

1621
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:02,410
That would give me...

1622
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,630
That would give me nightmares.

1623
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:05,130
Holy cow.

1624
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,800
I just exited the second tunnel.

1625
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:22,440
have to, like, direct me hard because I'm getting lost,
lost, lost.

1626
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,540
Jarvis, rewind the VOD.

1627
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,600
Blue attack?

1628
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,200
Oh, wow.

1629
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,180
Thank you for this fucking dono!

1630
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:43,600
I vote we release both brothers and let them fistfight on
top of one of those giant battle gears.

1631
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,560
I agree with this plan.

1632
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,460
Entrance to the other room is on the other side of the
island.

1633
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,040
Wait, am I getting one god?

1634
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,540
From outside, there's a Searist tunnel.

1635
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:55,300
Wait, oh.

1636
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,620
From outside.

1637
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,220
This one?

1638
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,160
No way.

1639
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,840
It was...

1640
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,740
It was that obvious.

1641
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:14,080
Holy...

1642
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,240
Wait, why is he got poison here?

1643
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:17,740
What is this?

1644
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,180
Okay.

1645
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,580
Interesting decor.

1646
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,020
Oh, his bed is horrible.

1647
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,800
It's like Virgil and Dante.

1648
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:27,700
It really is.

1649
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,340
Yes, it really is.

1650
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,170
What the heck is this?

1651
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:41,320
The beautiful rose is actually death.

1652
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,740
He just has that.

1653
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,730
He just owns that.

1654
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,940
The other half!

1655
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:53,800
Wait, the vault?

1656
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1657
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,320
The vault is...

1658
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:05,580
is located in very plain view on the islands of Mist.

1659
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:13,200
An access can be achieved very easily if the simple
instructions are followed.

1660
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:16,800
First locate each of the marker switchers on the island.

1661
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:17,580
We did that.

1662
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:24,980
Turn every one of these switches to the on position.

1663
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:33,120
Then go to the dock and as a final step, turn the marker
there to the off position.

1664
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:38,940
So we turn every single single... Wait, I feel like I did
that.

1665
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:47,540
So we turn all the switches on the island on, and then we
turn the one on the dock off.

1666
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:53,460
All on except dock.

1667
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,200
Another map.

1668
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,200
Another map.

1669
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,120
Another map.

1670
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,520
Okay, buddy.

1671
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,660
Whoa, these are sick.

1672
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,020
Whoa, freaky.

1673
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,140
All right, let's grab this page.

1674
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:15,440
Thank you.

1675
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,280
There I go.

1676
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,200
Thank you.

1677
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:33,150
I might be able to make it without the water or without the
light, I feel.

1678
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:34,530
Maybe.

1679
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,870
Let's try.

1680
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:42,450
Oh,

1681
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:48,800
it won't let me.

1682
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:50,040
Oh, that's evil.

1683
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,120
Okay.

1684
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:54,800
That's mean.

1685
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,120
Yeah, you need the light.

1686
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:00,080
Dang it.

1687
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,120
I feel like I did that thing with the dock.

1688
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:11,080
Oh, whoops.

1689
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,040
Because.

1690
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,300
I feel like I...

1691
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,860
I was just messing with the switches.

1692
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:22,860
Which one was it, guys?

1693
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,740
Is it this one?

1694
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,140
I remember just clicking a random one.

1695
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:29,020
135 degrees.

1696
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:36,910
Bottom right red.

1697
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:37,410
This one?

1698
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:38,590
Oh, thank you.

1699
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:41,710
Thank you guys so much.

1700
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:43,970
I appreciate you all so much.

1701
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:48,830
Otherwise, we just would have been...

1702
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:49,190
Oops.

1703
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:51,270
We just would have been...

1704
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,970
I would have...

1705
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:52,690
Obviously, I...

1706
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:55,430
You know, I could do the puzzle.

1707
01:54:56,670 --> 01:55:00,110
Obviously, I could do the puzzle, but at the same time,
we're just trying to...

1708
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:01,550
I thought I already did it, so.

1709
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:05,590
Even if it was by action.

1710
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:13,050
Ah!

1711
01:55:18,690 --> 01:55:21,650
Alright, we're just trying to get in and out so we can get
the pages.

1712
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:24,650
Oh my gosh, why one...

1713
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:27,530
Okay, let's listen to his mad rambling.

1714
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,950
things.

1715
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:31,310
Hello.

1716
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:32,250
Hello.

1717
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:33,910
Hi, Agna.

1718
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:35,410
You, sis.

1719
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:39,670
I'm glad to see that you've returned to help me escape from
my wrongful imprisonment.

1720
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:45,270
He was seriously did this for me.

1721
01:55:45,710 --> 01:55:46,350
I was your brother.

1722
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:48,430
Do not listen to him.

1723
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,110
I warn you.

1724
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:50,790
I warn you.

1725
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:51,610
He's a liar.

1726
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:52,650
He's a liar.

1727
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:54,890
He can't be persuaded by his evil lies.

1728
01:55:55,870 --> 01:55:56,450
My reason?

1729
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:57,590
To kill my father.

1730
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,610
He will kill you.

1731
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:03,830
What did he do to your father?

1732
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:07,050
It began when my brother Sears began to muster the riches.

1733
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:09,890
He stole from the ages of mist.

1734
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:11,730
The only riches wore himself.

1735
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:12,950
Evil lies.

1736
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:16,210
Father swept away his watchfulness.

1737
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:19,410
My sick brother secretly pronounced himself king.

1738
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,570
King of the ages of mist, he said.

1739
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,890
He began to look upon me in disgust.

1740
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:35,170
brother he's him his lovely brother and that's serious began
to destroy the ages of mr.

1741
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:46,290
burn their forest he tore down the structures and flooded
their lands murdered their inhabitants he destroyed all but

1742
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:56,450
four of the ages of course I had a woman father I finally
found him there was serious oh talking cleverly

1743
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:08,610
I don't know why I believe this guy over Sirius.

1744
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:11,430
It was I who was greedy for wealth and plunder.

1745
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,450
He seriously dealt with the final blow.

1746
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:17,630
He kicked the father into believing that I was the murderer.

1747
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:21,910
Like, he just seems so believable compared to Sirius.

1748
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:25,190
Yeah, he gives more details for sure.

1749
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,470
He has doubted my brother's clever lies.

1750
01:57:27,610 --> 01:57:38,710

All right, let me take a quick little photograph.

Look at this graph.

1769
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:27,670
Okay.

Okay, we're gonna...

1774
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:40,290
This is how I'll remember.

1775
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:40,950
Blue...

1776
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:42,150
That was blue pages.

1777
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,890
Then we have red page.

1778
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:45,750
And then we have...

1779
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:46,870

1785
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,690

1789
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,070
Mysterious lever?

02:00:07,150 --> 02:00:10,330
Oh, I guess I should have saved after the fireplace, huh?

1791
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:16,650
Whatever.

1792
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:17,710
I can resave.

1793
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:18,410
It's fine.

1794
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,150
What did he say?

1795
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,530
The door on the fireplace.

1796
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:30,510
Oh!

1797
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:33,910
Oh my god!

1798
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:36,210
I didn't notice that before!

1799
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:38,510
Volume check?

1800
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:39,350
Okay, thank you.

1801
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,710
How do I do this?

1802
02:00:42,290 --> 02:00:43,930
Oh, okay.

1803
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:55,920
Okay.

1804
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,000
Okay.

1805
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,000
Okay, so far so good.

1806
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:02,790
Okay, you can undo one if you mess up.

1807
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,900
Three, four, five.

1808
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:14,700
Okay, so far so good.

1809
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:20,260
That should be it.

1810
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,740
That should be it.

1811
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:29,120
Ha!

1812
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:32,720
Okay, awesome.

1813
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,480
It's right there.

1814
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,360
It's right there.

1815
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:45,740
Okay, now.

1816
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,700
Now I'm going to save again.

1817
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:49,060
Sorry, I'm going to save everything.

1818
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,260
Just so I can...

1819
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:51,940
I don't know if...

1820
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,480
Save.

1821
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:57,820
I'm probably overthinking this completely, but whatever.

1822
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,680
I just want to make sure I get everything, you know.

1823
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:02,760
And save.

1824
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:03,140
Okay.

1825
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:07,240
Let's...

1826
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:08,680
Dude...

1827
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:08,960
Wait.

1828
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:10,780
Wait.

1829
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:11,880
You know what?

1830
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:13,820
I don't remember what I did.

1831
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,460
Let's do the green...

1832
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:16,520
No!

1833
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:21,410
I'm good?

1834
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:22,130
Okay, cool.

1835
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:25,930
What did I save last?

1836
02:02:26,110 --> 02:02:26,630
You know what?

1837
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:27,830
I'm gonna... This is so stupid.

1838
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:31,530
I'm going to load... We're gonna load the blue pages.

1839
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:32,010
No!

1840
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:35,610
I'm gonna... Because I'm... Okay, I want to do the one that
I'm the least confident in.

1841
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:37,670
So we're gonna load the red pages.

1842
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:38,710
Okay.

1843
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:43,360
Oh, wow.

1844
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,380
It puts me here.

1845
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:44,840
Interesting.

1846
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,140
So if I go into the fireplace...

1847
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:49,300
Oh.

1848
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:50,460
It.

1849
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:51,700
It.

1850
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:52,340
It.

1851
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,660
Does it make me do it again?

1852
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:01,060
Oh, that's...

1853
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:02,040
That's stinky.

1854
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:04,220
Oh, that's stinky.

1855
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,120
Okay.

1856
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,000
Sorry, guys.

1857
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,200
I didn't know.

1858
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:10,600
I didn't know.

1859
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,560
I'm so sorry.

1860
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,300
Okay.

1861
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,300
That was a volume one.

1862
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,220
Memorize it?

1863
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:27,820
Yeah, I'll memorize it.

1864
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,440
Don't worry.

1865
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,880
Okay, that should be it.

1866
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:35,280
Nice.

1867
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:43,320
I think I chose the red page first, so let's do red page.

1868
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,640
Let's go

1869

You stupid fool.

1872
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:36,260
It looks like perhaps you're in the book now.

1873
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,020
Oh my god, this accent is killing me.

1874
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:43,060
A page.

1875
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,160
No, no.

1876
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:54,200

I can't understand you anymore.

1884
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:40,890
Oh, I understood that, though.

1885
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,240
Was that it?

1886
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,260
That was it.

1887
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,600
No stinking way, this guy.

1888
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,700
First bad end.

1889
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,920
Oh my gosh.

1890
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,160
Bro's streaming from his microwave.

1891
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:11,320
Ah!

1892
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,300

1893
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:18,900
Okay, I think?

1894
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,700
Okay, I think I have to...

02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,560
Okay, load.

1896
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,680
Alright, so that was the red page.

1897
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,240
Let's do the blue page.

1898
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:30,720
We're still the same thing's gonna think it happened!

1899
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:32,360
We're gonna give...

1900
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:35,520

1901
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,380

02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:18,960
Blue page.

1905
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,820
Maybe Akanar will be a nice guy.

1906
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:30,280
Maybe he'll, like, we'll switch places and then he'll be
like, Alright, buddy, I'm gonna get you out of there.

1907
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:31,760
Like, right now.

1908

1909
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:33,620
I know how.

1910
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,660
He'll help me for sure.

1911
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:39,420
I wonder what picture this No No Crab makes.

1912
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:40,780
A cat.

1913
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,020
Oh my gosh, we're in the book.

1914
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,940
It's so funny that it's so tiny.

1915
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:54,330
Oh yes, afraid!

1916
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:59,490
Oh, I feel alive!

1917
02:08:01,490 --> 02:08:03,210
How do you feel, my friend?

1918
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:06,370
Oh, whatever here.

1919
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:10,010
Perhaps Pages, you act so hard for.

1920
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:10,990
Yeah, yeah.

1921
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,070
What?

1922
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:15,330
What?

1923
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,390
Yeah, why are they laughing?

1924
02:08:19,490 --> 02:08:20,310

1925
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:23,770
I'm out of the book!

1926
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:27,830
Y'all seen the world from my point of view!

1927
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:28,630
Yes!

1928
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:30,110
Oh.

1929
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,310
No!

1930
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:36,250
Why are you so evil?

1931
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:41,030
Did he just go Twitter?

1932
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:51,390
Maybe someone will rescue you someday.

1933
02:08:57,630 --> 02:08:59,070
They both suck!

1934
02:09:09,630 --> 02:09:10,870
Put me out of my misery.

1935
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:13,370
I lose!

1936
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:21,860
Serious is greedy, Akinar is a sadist, they both suck.

1937
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:24,040
Oh my god, he's still ripping out pages!

1938
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,780
He's still going!

1939
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:37,560
Bad end number two.

Oh, there it is.

1945
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:15,060
Okay.

1946
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,860
One more time in the fireplace.

1947
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:20,960
Getting all dirty in there.

1948
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:25,300
Okay, I turn it down so you guys don't have to hear.

1949
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,580
Well, I hope it's one more time in the fireplace, you know.

1950
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:35,300
We gotta go rescue Papa.

1951
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:38,380
We gotta go rescue Daddy.

1952
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:39,940
What's his name?

1953
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:41,880
I don't know.

1954
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,900
Why are both of your children assholes?

1955
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,240
Two more times.

1956
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:50,780
Atrus.

1957
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:51,300
Atrus.

1958
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:54,160
One more time for the fourth ending.

1959
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:54,820
Oh, dang.

1960
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,140
Okay.

1961
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:55,840
Well, that's fine.

1962
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,860
Let's just get it out of the way.

1963
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:04,920
Who the devil are you?

1964
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:06,600
Don't come here to Dunny.

1965
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:07,760
Not yet.

1966
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:11,040
Oh, I have many questions for you, my friend.

1967
02:11:11,740 --> 02:11:13,280
As you no doubt have for me.

1968
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,200
Um, where should I begin?

1969
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,060
Uh-huh.

1970
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:17,740
Oh.

1971
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:19,560
Yeah?

1972
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,440
Why is your connection so good?

1973
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,040
My name is Atris.

1974
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,680
I feel you've met my son, Sirius and Akanah.

1975
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:29,840
I have, unfortunately.

1976
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:30,900
Yeah.

1977
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:31,980
Missed Island.

1978
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:34,200
In my library.

1979
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:35,360
My library.

1980
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,080
Oh.

1981
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:40,200
It contains my works, my writings.

1982
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:41,740
Why are you in there?

1983
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,100
Oh, I wrote many books.

1984
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:46,040
It linked me to fantastic places.

1985
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:50,140
It's an art I learned from my father many years ago.

1986
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:54,660
Oh, but the red and blue books, those were different.

1987
02:11:56,020 --> 02:12:05,180
I wrote those books too, in trap over greedy explorers that
might stumble upon my island of mist.

1988
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:09,940
But I had no idea my own sons would be entrapped.

1989
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:30,560
my sons yeah they're poopy I gave them free reign to looks
yeah perhaps it was not wise yeah I think that was a mistake

1990
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:37,660
I think they needed a father figure instead of running
around and different I had not told them about the red and

1991
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:48,380
blue books gave them my parents exactly while they dreamed
of riches and power of course they did not know the books

1992
02:12:48,380 --> 02:13:02,280
were traps oh they begged for access to those books and I of
course denied them ah typical typical modern-day parents

1993
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:12,140
they devised a plan an evil plan sorry I'm trying to what
extent some throat spread I think I'm out though and I

1994
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:24,540
forgot to buy more in Japan their own mother feels their own
mother oh my dear Catherine her to lure me here to Dunny of

1995
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:32,340
course I I could return to mist except that yeah they
removed a single page from my mist linking oh no I cannot

to me but then I'll be stuck in your Oh, I pray you believe

1997
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:42,380
my story above the lies that my sons have told you.

1998
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:51,720
If you could find it in yourself to return that page to me
here in Dunney, I could go to Mist and bring justice to my

1999
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,480
sons for what they have done.

2000
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:57,980

One more time!

2124
02:22:40,570 --> 02:22:42,290
This is karma for waking you, boy.

2125
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:44,510

Okay, I'm gonna save while I'm in there.

Maybe that will do the trick.

2136
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:32,060
Happy birthday, everybody.

2137
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:35,240
Just sit when he disappears.

02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:13,540
Oh, do you want the page?

2165
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:16,680
No, do you want the page?

2166
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:18,320
Okay.

2167
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:22,060
You've done the right thing.

2168
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:23,800
The page, my friend.

2169
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:24,400
The page.

2170
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:28,360
I have a difficult choice to make.

2171
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:33,780
All right, I'm just gonna sit here.

2172
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,560
I'm not gonna move at all, okay?

2173
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:37,200
We're just gonna sit.

2174
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,080
And we're gonna wait.

2175
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:50,230
What's the prog- what's the diagnosis, Doc?

2176
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:52,230
They betrayed you!

2177
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:55,570
I shall return shortly.

2178
02:24:55,830 --> 02:24:56,110
Okay!

2179
02:24:56,810 --> 02:24:58,430
I won't go anywhere!

2180
02:24:59,450 --> 02:25:00,390
I won't go anywhere.

2181
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:10,060
My hands are off the keyboard, they're in my pants.

2182
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,760
Oh, he's back!

2183
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:26,540
It is done.

2184
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:28,140
Did you kill him?

2185
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,220
Great time, thank you!

2186
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:30,900
I have many questions for you, my friend.

2187
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:35,920
writing cannot wait.

2188
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:47,060
I fear that my long delay may have already had a
catastrophic impact on the world in which my wife Catherine

2189
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:49,040
is now being held hostage.

2190
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,260
What?

2191
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:51,940
Where?

2192
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,080
Where is Catherine?

2193
02:25:54,040 --> 02:26:02,940
And the reward, I'm sorry, but all I have to offer you is
the library on the island of in the books that are contained

2197
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:40,990
I may find it necessary to request your assistance.

2198
02:26:41,130 --> 02:26:41,570
Me!

2199
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:48,950
Until that point, feel free to enjoy the explorations from
my library on Mist.

2200
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:50,370
Thank you again.

2201
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:51,710
Thank you!

2202
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:55,920
That's not it?

2203
02:26:56,520 --> 02:26:57,460
That's the ending?

2204
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:59,440
Congratulations on beating Mist!

2205
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,380
When back the man on the floor and...

2206
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:01,900
The book.

2207
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:06,240
You can use the Mist to make your book to And I is the man
who modeled the room.

2208
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:07,100
Oh, cool.

2209
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:08,420
Or dummy.

2210
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:09,480
Dunny.

2211
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:10,500
Dunny.

2212
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:12,740
How do I...

2213
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:13,580
Oh, here we go.

2214
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:17,860
We did it!

2215
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:20,820
What?

2216
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:22,680
That was an ending...

2217
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:22,960
Wait.

2218
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:26,260
Oh my god!

2219
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:27,900
He really did kill them.

2220
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,100
Oh my god.

2221
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:31,700
They're dead!

2222
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:32,420
They're dead!

2223
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:33,240
They're dead!

2224
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,400
Wow.

2225
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:39,160
He killed them.

2226
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:46,160
Well, guys.

2227
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:48,440
That's another...

2228
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:49,800
And we got all the endings!

2229
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:50,720
Woohoo!

2230
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:53,460
Yeah!

2231
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,020
He unalived them.

2232
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:56,220
He unalived them.

2233
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,780
Let me add that to my...

2234
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:03,840
My drive, my list, my Excel sheet.

2235
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:06,540
Um...

2236
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:12,800
Let's see.

2237
02:28:14,780 --> 02:28:18,720
12, 12, 16, 20, 25.

2238
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:19,160
Miss!

2239
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:19,720
Yeah!

2240
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:21,820
Whoa, whoa!

2241
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:24,860
Yippee!

2242
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:28,020
We did it.

2243
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:29,160
How many left now?

2244
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:32,260
Six.

2245
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,860
Six games left!

2246
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:39,600
I feel like they missed an opportunity in this one.

2247
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:40,940
We're traversing books, yes, but we're not.

2248
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:43,040
Where's the de-boning one of them?

2249
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,740
I don't want to go there.

2250
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:45,860
I don't want to go there.

2251
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:49,420
Six left.

2252
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:54,480
And then tomorrow, I should be able to beat Untitled Goose
Game.

2253
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,360
So then it will be five.

2254
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:00,200
And I have a couple games lined up.

2255
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:01,880
I have three games lined up to beat.

2256
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:04,220
So I just have to come up with two more games.

2257
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:10,940
And I should be able to complete 50 games this year.

2258
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:19,420
I remember playing this with my mom way back then Thanks for
the memories and don't play mystery unless you have an

2259
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:29,100
engineering degree Oh, whoa I don't know, maybe we could do
Riven But it seems to be a longer Game, no?

2260
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:37,280
I'm not opposed to playing it In general, but

2261
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:49,780
It's much longer Yeah, yeah, I've heard, I've heard, I've
heard Just curious, have you ever tried melting Andy's

2262
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:51,660
chocolate mints in coffee or hot chocolate?

2263
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,160
Oh, I have before!

2264
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:54,480
Yes, it's so good!

2265
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:56,340
That's so good!

2266
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:00,480
Play it next year sometime.

2267
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:01,660
Yeah, I think that's the plan.

2268
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:04,240
What about starting a new series for your last one?

2269
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:05,420
I will not have a...

2270
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:06,540
Yakuza Zero!

2271
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:13,380
I will not have enough time to complete a long game like
that, unfortunately.

2272
02:30:16,180 --> 02:30:16,700
Yakuza!

2273
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:17,940
Damn!

2274
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:23,740
Right now I'm kind of doing only like one shot.

2275
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:25,700
Uh...

2276
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,500
Yeah.

2277
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,000
You go through the bookshelf and the library?

2278
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:31,440
Yeah, I had to.

2279
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:33,700
That's how you get the hints for the game.

2280
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:35,500
Thank you for the summertime!

2281
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:38,440
Xibong, thank you!

2282
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:41,580
For the last two games you should do some humongous
entertainment games.

2283
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:44,300
Oh, like...

2284
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:45,300
Like PUTPUT?

2285
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:46,520
Or Freddy Fish?

2286
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:48,320
Oh my gosh, wait, could we do?

2287
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:50,860
I loved Freddy Fish in the haunted schoolhouse.

2288
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:54,040
That was the only one I ever played because it was a haunted
schoolhouse.

2289
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:56,220
And I wanted to play.

2290
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:57,660
Another one.

2291
02:30:57,740 --> 02:30:59,540
Can we see the full list at the end of the year?

2292
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:00,400
Yeah, of course!

2293
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,160
I will, of course, post it.

2294
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:07,300
Once again, I highly recommend playing Riven and Miss 3.

2295
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:08,900
You're super good in Riven.

2296
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:09,660
Yeah, yeah.

2297
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:10,740
Riven is on the list.

2298
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:11,260
Don't worry.

2299
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,800
Are you planning to finish Battle Block with Barry?

2300
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:14,720
That's on the list!

2301
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:15,380
Yep, yep.

2302
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:17,420
Oh, and it's pretty short.

2303
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:19,660
It's by the Limbo game that's designed it.

2304
02:31:20,420 --> 02:31:24,340
Yeah, but Limbo ended up taking me two streams and I thought
it would only take me one.

2305
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:26,300
Freddy Fish, though.

2306
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,320
Freddy Fish would be fun.

2307
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,480
Shout out one of my favorite childhood games.

2308
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,000
The Day the World Broke.

2309
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:41,800
I always thought it had a similar vibe to Miss and with a
touch more whimsy and talking mechanical ammish.

2310
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:42,720
Cool.

2311
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:44,260
Never heard of it.

2312
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:48,620
Sierra games like Space.

2313
02:31:48,640 --> 02:32:00,240
quest police quest etc maybe yeah yeah i think we could do
freddy fish no half-life episodes i determined that i

2314
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:08,280
probably wouldn't be able to finish them in time or rather
in one stream so i'm trying to really only focus on games

2315
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:16,620
that i can do in one stream um yeah yeah i thought for some
reason i thought mist would be able to be one stream but Or

2316
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:21,140
originally, I think I was planning on doing it in one
stream, and then I had the meeting, and then the meeting did

2317
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:23,340
not happen, so...

2318
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:26,300
Yeah, mischanged the trajectory of my tasting gaze.

2319
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:26,720
Whoa!

2320
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,720
It's a bit rough as it was an indie game for a long time
ago.

2321
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:31,620
The sequels are great.

2322
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:32,040
Yeah!

2323
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:37,370
Journeyman project a look.

2324
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:39,450
Very similar gameplay with time travel.

2325
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:42,270
I like it.

2326
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:45,710
But I'll come up with some stuff, so...

2327
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:53,590
could have without the meeting yeah i actually planned on
finishing it in one go but then the meeting happened i was

2328
02:32:53,590 --> 02:33:03,170
like okay well i'll get through 50 of the game which
happened and then yeah but it's all good it's all good i'm

2329
02:33:03,170 --> 02:33:10,670
gonna put freddy fish on my list ready wait can i even get
that on steam let's see i might have to find it elsewhere

2330
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:14,250
Freddy...

2331
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:15,670
Five nights at Freddy's.

2332
02:33:16,690 --> 02:33:17,410
Freddy fish.

2333
02:33:18,450 --> 02:33:19,330
They do have it.

2334
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:20,090
Wait, did they have the haunted?

2335
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:22,430
They have the haunted schoolhouse!

2336
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:26,190
That's my favorite one.

2337
02:33:28,570 --> 02:33:29,790
That's my favorite one.

2338
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:30,910
It's the only one I've ever...

2339
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:33,090
I say it's my favorite, it's the only one I've ever played.

2340
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:37,950
I didn't really care about games unless they had spooky,
like...

2341
02:33:38,610 --> 02:33:39,570
I don't think...

2342
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:41,830
Like, similar to, like, I-Spy.

2343
02:33:43,210 --> 02:33:47,570
Haunted Mansion, that was the only I-Spy I ever played
because it was a haunted mansion.

2344
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:53,530
And Freddy Fish, I only played it because it was Haunted
Schoolhouse.

2345
02:33:54,250 --> 02:33:58,570
I only liked spooky games when I was...
