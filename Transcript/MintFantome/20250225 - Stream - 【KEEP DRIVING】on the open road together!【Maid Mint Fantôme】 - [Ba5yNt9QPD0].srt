1
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,030
Welcome back!

2
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,810
Hello!

3
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,190
Hello, hello, hello!

4
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,510
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in!

5
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,010
I mean the...Hi!

6
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,510
You like my hat?

7
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,530
Should I have glasses on too?

8
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,470
It's fine.

9
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,310
We're shaded.

10
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,970
Cute dress.

11
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,710
This is what I always wear.

12
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,390
It's Southern Bellamy.

13
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,710
Howdy.

14
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,930
Are y'all here for a cool drive?

15
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,390
Are y'all here for the Mint Phantom stream experience?

16
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,390
Well, I was just a small lass when I first got my car.

17
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,410
It was called a tractor.

18
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,350
Yay!

19
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,530
Oh my gosh.

20
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,990
Yesterday I tried to buy the same MGS Delta you got from Playasia, but I waited too long for my pay to come first.

21
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,410
Now it's sold out!

22
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,610
Oh my gosh.

23
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,130
No!

24
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,350
We'll use the money to support you through my first Akasupa future merch!

25
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,130
Thank you!

26
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,030
Oh wow, I didn't think...I didn't realize it would sell out.

27
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,790
Now, I know which one you're talking about.

28
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,870
They had the Metal Gear.

29
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,290
The one with the bust, right?

30
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,130
And I tried ordering it through...

31
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,810
Directly from the Konami Style Store, but it got cancelled.

32
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,950
And so I was like, oh my goodness, thank you Playasia for also putting it up.

33
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,510
Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get it.

34
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,250
I'm sorry, Jay!

35
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,990
Thank you for the first ever Akasupa.

36
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,890
Thank you!

37
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm really honored.

38
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,770
Sold out because she bought all the stock.

39
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,730
It was...

40
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,970
Very expensive.

41
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,850
I would not buy more than one.

42
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,150
Especially if I was gonna think it would sell...I didn't think it was gonna sell out.

43
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,410
Because it was so expensive.

44
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,430
Anyway, welcome to Keep Driving!

45
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,670
I saw this game actually when it first released on Steam.

46
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,290
And I was like, this seems pretty cool.

47
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,690
And then I saw people talking about the reviews and everything.

48
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,470
And I was like, okay, this seems really cool.

49
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,330
So I wanted to play it.

50
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,190
Hatsune Mike, welcome to membership.

51
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,190
Thank you!

52
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,930
Minto scalping MGS.

53
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,210
No!

54
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,270
Don't lump me in with those nasty scalpers, the bane of my existence.

55
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,310
Maybe that's why I'm a ghost.

56
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,530
Maybe I died because I got scalped and I really wanted something and then I died.

57
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,570
And now I'm haunting the scalpers.

58
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,870
I'm making sure...I'm sitting on their chests while they sleep so they never have a good night's rest.

59
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,850
Sundress Minto win?

60
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,710
I don't know.

61
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,210
It's embarrassing.

62
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,590
It's embarrassing.

63
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,870
Soul got scalped.

64
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,450
Yeah, we hate scalpers in this household.

65
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,790
So true.

66
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,730
Now I gotta become a scalper.

67
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,410
No!

68
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,950
You won't see me as I am right now.

69
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,050
You'll see...

70
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,750
I would disguise myself as your worst nightmare so you wouldn't even enjoy it.

71
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,530
You wouldn't even be like...

72
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,010
You wouldn't even be like...

73
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,410
It's Minto sitting on my chest.

74
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,930
No, no.

75
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,830
It would be a demon.

76
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,170
It would be sleep paralysis Minto.

77
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,610
And I'm scary.

78
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,250
I am scary.

79
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:29,270
I am scary because you saw my...you saw my...well, maybe you didn't if you did not watch my Valentine's Day stream.

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,770
I am scary.

81
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,770
Keep driving or the car explodes.

82
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,050
A lot of stuff got scalped from me.

83
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,750
Haunt hard or...what?

84
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,490
What are you talking about Chuggie?

85
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,170
What did you want?

86
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,210
I'll throw hands.

87
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,090
I got my hands up.

88
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,030
Yeah!

89
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,880
Sure you are sweetie.

90
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,600
You saw!

91
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,920
If you didn't watch, go!

92
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,220
Where is my son?

93
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,360
Thanks for two months.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,260
Boo.

95
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,180
Not scary to me.

96
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,480
Starboy Jack, welcome to membership and Patquin.

97
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,300
Welcome back.

98
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,040
I got my hands up.

99
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,200
I got my hands up.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,000
Anyway, I don't know quite what this game is about.

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,800
Part of me is like, I feel like we'll be able to yap mid-game, right?

102
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,620
And I want to play as much as I can because I do have another stream later tonight, I think.

103
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,780
Actually, I haven't heard from anybody.

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,600
Let me message everybody and say, are we doing this?

105
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,220
Are we still on for tonight?

106
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,540
We good for tonight?

107
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:45,860
Nodders.

108
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,560
Doki has stream up?

109
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,840
Ah, ok cool.

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,920
We're on for tonight.

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,920
Doki has an inner schedule?

112
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,300
Ok.

113
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,500
Doki has a waiting room.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,180
Ok, ok, ok.

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,940
Alright, I want to play as much as I can of this too.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,540
I think I remember it being maybe a roguelike too, but it's basically like a...

117
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,820
It says it's an RPG, but it's like a driving RPG and inventory management stuff.

118
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,720
It feels like it will be very cozy.

119
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,900
The summer sprawls out before you as you're about to go on your first big road trip alone.

120
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,900
It's been so cold lately though.

121
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,700
Maybe I do need some summer vibes.

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,080
She's so cute when she tries to be scary.

123
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,300
I am scary!

124
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,180
I am!

125
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,880
It is pretty roguelike, huh?

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,560
It's the early 2000s.

127
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,400
You've recently got your license.

128
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh!

129
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,460
I also wanted to say...

130
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,680
There is a streamer mode for this game, but I did not turn it on.

131
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,780
Because it says that you'll miss out on some cool music.

132
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Honestly, I'd rather listen to cool music than stay monetized.

133
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,760
We'll keep that...

134
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:17,300
Honestly, usually if it's a thing like that, you just lose the monetization for the stream.

135
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,180
I'd much rather listen to the cool music and have you guys listen to it too.

136
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,800
Maybe we can discover something else that we...

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,680
Like a new band or something that we like.

138
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
You're young.

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,860
Take it easy.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
You have time.

141
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Is this gonna heal some people's inner child?

142
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,340
Driving spooky.

143
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,980
Sending Spotify finds.

144
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,260
Oh!

145
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,180
Is this me?

146
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,780
Wait, A?

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Or B?

148
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,720
We got a sick...

149
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,280
We can be...

150
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,120
We can be not snake?

151
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,200
We could be not solid snake or we could be the boss.

152
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,040
One is handsome.

153
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,600
They're both beautiful.

154
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,380
Unmetal guy.

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,480
B?

156
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,660
Okay, we'll go with B.

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,800
Background.

158
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,840
What's your name?

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,080
Minto.

160
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,560
Relationship with your parents.

161
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,380
Uh...

162
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,060
What does that mean?

163
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,300
A good relationship with your parents will help you in a pinch.

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
Oh, this is not real.

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,280
I feel like I'm at therapy right now.

166
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
OSC is cool.

167
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,180
You have to set your playlist every time I finish playing.

168
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,620
Oh, I see.

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,180
What's my occupation?

170
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,500
Oh, starting trait.

171
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,380
Carefree.

172
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,000
Wanderlust restores one additional energy.

173
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,440
Okay, we don't know what any of this means.

174
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,000
So we can be unemployed.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Part-time mechanic, which means we're car savvy.

176
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,560
Whenever you restore durability, restore one more.

177
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,360
Okay.

178
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,160
Or...

179
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,680
A student.

180
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,700
Start with one skill point.

181
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
Gain a skill point when you read.

182
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,820
Interesting.

183
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,940
And there's nothing else.

184
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,640
Um...

185
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,020
Uh...

186
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,540
Are we in NEET?

187
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,080
Restores one additional energy.

188
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,060
I feel an additional energy means we would be able to do more stuff.

189
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,680
So maybe let's try for that.

190
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,060
And what are you bringing with you?

191
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,800
Mom's care package.

192
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
Which is...

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,900
Chocolate.

194
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,580
Jerry can full.

195
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,980
Bandage.

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Banana.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,940
I read that as bandana.

198
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,680
Aspirin and letters.

199
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,480
My tools.

200
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,140
Toolbox.

201
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,400
Jerry can full.

202
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,180
Duct tape.

203
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Apples.

204
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,380
Letters.

205
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
Or guitar and beer!

206
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,300
This feels on brand for our character.

207
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,860
We're a wanderlust carefree...

208
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,240
Carefree Minta.

209
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,320
In the early 2000s.

210
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,260
We have a guitar.

211
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,400
Cigarettes.

212
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,860
Beer case and letters.

213
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,140
Beer o'clock baby.

214
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,640
Am I picking?

215
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,840
I feel like I'm accidentally picking hard mode right now.

216
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
Mint.

217
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,260
That's me!

218
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,060
That's me!

219
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,340
For sale.

220
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,020
1981 sedan.

221
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,940
Four passenger seat.

222
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,320
Two passenger seat.

223
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,260
Average trunk.

224
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,020
Average engine.

225
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,720
Big trunk.

226
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,720
Average engine.

227
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,760
Muscle.

228
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,060
Small trunk.

229
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Good engine.

230
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,020
This feels like the best of all the worlds.

231
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,920
But we will have to...

232
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,440
Really...

233
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,020
Space our inventory much more here.

234
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,160
I've never driven a truck before.

235
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,620
Not available.

236
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,680
Oh, it does say not available.

237
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,240
You're right.

238
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,440
Oh, I didn't miss that.

239
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,340
Or I didn't see that.

240
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,680
So we have to go with the sedan.

241
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,580
Oh, shucks.

242
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,780
My license!

243
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,300
Name.

244
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,020
Minto.

245
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,160
Parent.

246
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,280
Parent relation.

247
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,960
Three out of...

248
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,580
Oh, okay.

249
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:24,980
Wow.

250
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,140
Why is my license sharing my trauma?

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,940
Okay.

252
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,880
Here we go!

253
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,340
I will try to find a good place for me to...

254
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,580
As you can see, there's like some gas here.

255
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,960
There's a bunch of stuff on the bottom.

256
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,900
Maybe...

257
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,380
Hold on.

258
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,580
Maybe I shrink myself and I kind of go...

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,040
Like up here.

260
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,980
I'm like on the dashboard.

261
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,340
I'm like one of those hula ladies.

262
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm a hula lady!

263
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,580
Aloha!

264
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll try it like this.

265
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,920
And we'll just adjust as we go along.

266
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,920
So it's Sunday.

267
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,220
June 3rd.

268
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,180
10 AM.

269
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,400
Oh, kiddo!

270
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,420
Thank you for the hula costume!

271
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,460
It's my birthday, so I'm spending...

272
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,660
Building my mythical clock while watching...

273
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,840
Wait, you got your mythical...

274
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,740
Wait, you got it?

275
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,580
You got your...

276
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,700
Wait...

277
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,280
The block?

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,640
While watching my kami-yoshi.

279
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,980
Happy birthday from our favorite cosplay.

280
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,040
We'll really make it complete soon in the year of...

281
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,960
Crash-outs and karaoke.

282
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,440
Your undead fills our lives with laughter.

283
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,340
Happy birthday, Akira!

284
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,020
Happy birthday to you!

285
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,820
Oh, I'm getting blocks.

286
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,820
It's okay.

287
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,720
Happy birthday to you!

288
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,060
Happy birthday, dear Akira!

289
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,400
Phantom Thief of Hearts!

290
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,620
Happy birthday to you!

291
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,000
Happy birthday!

292
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,470
Also, Ryan, thank you for the 10 gifted.

293
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,850
Above energy is best.

294
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,370
Right side has event stuff happening.

295
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,530
Oh, I see, I see.

296
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,510
Okay, I'm gonna shrink myself even more.

297
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,090
And we'll move our...

298
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,210
Right here.

299
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,650
Oh my gosh, this is weird.

300
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,570
I'm on the left side.

301
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,770
You guys will join me.

302
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,510
You guys will join me.

303
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,670
I gotta move my setup now.

304
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,210
Don't fall off the dash.

305
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,830
One second, I'm adjusting some stuff on my game screen.

306
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,130
I'm small.

307
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,270
There we go.

308
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,450
Oh, look.

309
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,490
The wind just makes me feel so like...

310
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,070
Makes me wanna take a deep, big breath.

311
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,870
You know?

312
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,610
Is this game gonna make me wanna touch grass?

313
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,590
Let's enter.

314
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,310
Click and drag items from your home into your trunk.

315
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,850
You can also shift-click items to move them instantly.

316
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:22,950
Okay.

317
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,290
My cigarettes.

318
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,670
My beer case.

319
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,130
Don't forget your letter.

320
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,350
Seems like there is one letter here from your friend.

321
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,610
Can I open it?

322
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,010
No.

323
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,380
Okay.

324
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,420
My beer case.

325
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,580
A case of beer.

326
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,080
Gets you happy and drunk.

327
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,420
A nice electric guitar.

328
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
Used from glove box during events.

329
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,900
Oh wait, I can put it in my glove box.

330
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,300
Look at that.

331
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,360
We have chewing gum, duct tape, chocolate.

332
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,520
Nice.

333
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,720
Thank you so much, Minten everyone.

334
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,720
My mythical came last night.

335
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,280
Oh my gosh!

336
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,580
Have fun in Japan, Minten.

337
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,380
Thank you!

338
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,400
Right-click it.

339
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,560
What?

340
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:09,860
This?

341
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,780
Oh yeah.

342
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,700
It says use.

343
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,980
But we are not gonna use it right now.

344
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,100
Is this my room?

345
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,080
Two lane.

346
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,560
This is me.

347
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,200
Oh my gosh!

348
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm ruffling the hair.

349
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,340
You can head-pat.

350
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,520
That's so cute.

351
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,880
Sorry.

352
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,540
I didn't expect that.

353
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,360
AD.

354
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,100
Okay.

355
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,900
I got 75 dollars to my name.

356
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,340
And we are on...

357
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,740
Oh no!

358
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,540
Oh my gosh.

359
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,760
We are a bit of a speed demon.

360
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,700
Click the car to...

361
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh wait.

362
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,520
Click the car to open car menu.

363
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,060
Trunk.

364
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,100
Calendar.

365
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,480
We got no logs.

366
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,140
And road map.

367
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,080
Whoa!

368
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,840
Where are we going?

369
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
Where are we?

370
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,110
Where are we?

371
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,890
We are in the country.

372
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,850
We could go to the motorway.

373
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,650
Read the letter.

374
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,030
Oh is that what you guys meant?

375
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,230
To read the letter...

376
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,810
By right-click.

377
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,870
I see.

378
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,450
New journey.

379
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,570
Way out festival.

380
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,910
Click and hold to open.

381
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,770
Hey!

382
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,250
Are you coming to the festival this year?

383
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,950
I heard you got a new car.

384
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,530
Fun!

385
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,130
You can buy a ticket in any big city.

386
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,710
It's kind of a long ways away.

387
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,710
But you'll make it.

388
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,390
Don't forget to sleep and fill up when you are low on gas.

389
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,670
I was stranded.

390
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,550
I was stranded once or twice.

391
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,290
It's not too bad if you have some money.

392
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,010
See you in four weeks!

393
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,090
Get a ticket.

394
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,230
Get a tent.

395
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,530
Get to the festival.

396
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,410
Okay.

397
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,030
Accept.

398
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,770
Oh they were not kidding.

399
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:00,910
Wait.

400
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,050
We have to go around.

401
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,550
Is this our first...

402
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,750
Wait.

403
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,470
Game of the year?

404
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,290
Finally.

405
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,590
The Oregon Trail 2.

406
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
What counts as a major...

407
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,280
Is Toropolis a major city?

408
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,040
Feels like it should be.

409
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,480
No?

410
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,180
Alright.

411
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,220
Let's just go.

412
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,180
Let's just go for it.

413
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,020
We are still learning the game.

414
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,960
We are leaving.

415
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,020
See you mom!

416
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,620
Oh.

417
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,420
I'm going.

418
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,060
You want to leave immediately.

419
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,440
No?

420
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,700
Can I...

421
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,080
Yes?

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,340
Yes?

423
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,300
No!

424
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm not doing anything anymore.

425
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,500
Track the...

426
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,930
Makes a peaceful humming sound.

427
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,310
This is a road event.

428
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,370
What?

429
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,800
Wait.

430
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,040
This is such a vibe.

431
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,580
These symbols represent the road events that are called...

432
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,860
Are called threat.

433
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
Each threat corresponds to one of your resources.

434
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,440
Each threat...

435
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,560
Oh.

436
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,220
Energy.

437
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Cash.

438
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Durability.

439
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,440
And gas.

440
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,160
These are my skills.

441
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,480
You need to use skills in order to remove the threat.

442
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,840
During the player phase, you can use one skill.

443
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,560
Turn it down just a little bit.

444
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,700
The dots show how many uses a skill has.

445
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,020
Okay.

446
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,220
When you're out of uses, the skill can't be used until you rest.

447
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,940
The bottom icons show what type of threat the skills can remove.

448
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
White star...

449
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,520
Cons.

450
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,860
That...

451
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,080
Apparently.

452
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,580
It's just a blob.

453
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,080
The skill can remove threat of any type.

454
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,740
X icons remove no threat.

455
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,900
Use the skill Relax and align it with the threat at the bottom to remove it.

456
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,520
Click and drag the skill to the threat icon at the bottom display.

457
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,960
Perfect!

458
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,740
I get an extra turn!

459
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,260
When each of the skill icons remove threat, you get a perfect hit.

460
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,580
What is this game?

461
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,860
When you get a perfect hit, you get an extra turn.

462
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,940
This means you can use another skill this turn.

463
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,480
Some skills have costs.

464
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,320
It is shown here.

465
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,740
So this is an energy cost.

466
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,540
Getting into VTubers again!

467
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,780
I think I found my cute ghost girl, Oshi!

468
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,840
Can we get a youmu konpaku outfit at some point?

469
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
That would be fun.

470
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,280
Thank you, Arhus!

471
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,680
One energy.

472
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,140
Go ahead and use the Have a Go skill and remove another threat.

473
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,980
It removes anything.

474
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,480
Can we just get rid of anything?

475
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,220
We'll get rid of this one.

476
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,600
Great!

477
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,720
Even though you've got another perfect hit, your turn will end.

478
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,540
You may only get one extra turn each player phase.

479
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,320
On the road phase, the threat with a warning icon will then attack you!

480
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,160
Why is the tractor attacking me?

481
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,500
Each threat deals damage to its corresponding resource.

482
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,840
There are different kinds of threat warnings.

483
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,840
You can hover over them to see what they do or check the full list by pressing this button.

484
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,060
Ouch!

485
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,680
Ouch!

486
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,980
What am I losing?

487
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,860
After the road phase, something will happen.

488
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,400
A new threat warning will be displayed.

489
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,380
You...

490
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,900
Defeat the road event when all threat is removed.

491
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,320
Nothing happens.

492
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:08,840
Okay.

493
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,020
All three of them!

494
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,060
You can escape from events by holding down the gas pedal.

495
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,540
Before escaping, each threat will damage you.

496
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,480
This is your glove box.

497
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,060
You can place small items in here.

498
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,260
Some items can be used just like skills during road events.

499
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,520
Okay.

500
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,180
Does this work?

501
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,560
No, it technically doesn't.

502
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,180
What about this?

503
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
From the glove box...

504
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,720
Oh, I see.

505
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,100
I see.

506
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,500
So it has to, like, align, right?

507
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,080
This one... The cigarettes could get rid of just this one.

508
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,920
And then this...

509
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,420
Would get rid of just one.

510
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,720
Okay.

511
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,940
The chocolate does nothing.

512
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,480
Oh, no!

513
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,560
It restores two...

514
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,940
Energy.

515
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,260
Wait!

516
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,420
I didn't mean to use it.

517
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,040
Oh my goodness.

518
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,480
I didn't mean to use it!

519
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:03,720
No!

520
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,920
I clicked it on accident!

521
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,860
Oh my gosh.

522
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,260
Okay.

523
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,640
Whoops.

524
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,660
My bad.

525
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,160
I wish I could, like, move these, you know?

526
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,980
Well, this is the only threat.

527
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,500
Let's just use this.

528
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:23,820
Wait.

529
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,920
We don't need to, right?

530
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,220
I get an extra turn.

531
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
But I don't want to waste this.

532
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,940
You know what?

533
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,340
Let's just...

534
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,840
We're learning how the game works.

535
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,820
So let's just try it.

536
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay.

537
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,880
More attacks this turn!

538
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,920
I have no idea what's going on.

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,500
Me neither.

540
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,380
So if I tried this...

541
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,840
There we go!

542
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,860
Alright!

543
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,120
We got through!

544
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,680
Why are you attacking a tractor?

545
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,740
More like the tractor was attacking me!

546
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,140
It's fine.

547
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,580
We're cool.

548
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,120
We're chill.

549
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,740
We're vibing.

550
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,720
Another tractor!

551
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,720
Another tractor.

552
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,180
Okay.

553
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,740
Only one thing was...

554
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,440
Oh, see?

555
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,300
Like the chewing gum.

556
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,380
But it would be better to use this, maybe.

557
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,000
This is like a real tac...

558
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,800
And then...

559
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,560
Oh my gosh.

560
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,240
This is so tactical RPG.

561
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,720
I mean, we gotta get rid of all of it, so...

562
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,700
Okay.

563
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,000
It would be better to do that.

564
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,900
We'd at least get rid of one.

565
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,740
Where does the damage happen?

566
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,200
Oh, I think it's over here.

567
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,880
Okay.

568
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,020
Extra phase.

569
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,920
Okay!

570
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Bottles!

571
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,560
Oh no!

572
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,380
This is not as...

573
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,020
As, um...

574
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,760
What's the word?

575
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,420
As Conkool Collected as I thought this would be.

576
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,980
Oh wait, so I can't use this one again.

577
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,480
Oh no.

578
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:30,900
Okay.

579
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
I can't, right?

580
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,460
Yeah, it won't let me.

581
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,820
Okay.

582
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,380
It's very intense.

583
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,760
What is...

584
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,540
Wait, what is this?

585
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,940
When you hit this threat...

586
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,020
Also remove...

587
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,240
Adjacent threat!

588
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh my gosh!

589
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
We, like, actually...

590
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,200
We...

591
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,420
We combo.

592
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,660
Wombo combo, baby.

593
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,540
Who are we talking to?

594
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,260
Oh!

595
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:12,740
Hello.

596
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,660
Hey!

597
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,620
If you're going out on the road, you better be prepared.

598
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,840
You gotta have a journal.

599
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,020
To write stuff down.

600
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,220
Oh, and a music player is...

601
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,760
Necessary.

602
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,100
Music player is necessary, though.

603
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,760
Minto.

604
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,580
Very cool.

605
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,420
Oh!

606
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,900
We added a journal, rest, and music.

607
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,380
Oh, cool!

608
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,900
And then, if you guys like the music...

609
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,140
These are, like, actual bands, so...

610
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,940
Wait, do you wanna come in?

611
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,540
Good luck out there!

612
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,660
Our journal...

613
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Right click to see details.

614
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,180
Oh, wow!

615
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,520
We can unlock new skill stuff!

616
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,280
I'm guessing we need two points for it.

617
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,220
Yeah, cost two skill points to unlock.

618
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,380
Alright.

619
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,640
Wait.

620
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,400
Something is...

621
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
Something is...

622
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,620
You saw that there was an exclamation point.

623
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,540
Huh.

624
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,320
We have a rest.

625
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,440
Durability minus one.

626
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,060
Where are we, anyway?

627
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,820
Oh, we're, like, halfway there!

628
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,360
If my car had a durability...

629
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,300
It would be, like...

630
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,320
One.

631
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,440
It would be, like...

632
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,360
One, probably.

633
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,420
I like how we're just in the middle of the road right now.

634
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,240
West coast.

635
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,160
That's what we're listening to right now, baby.

636
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,940
There might be something up with the suspension.

637
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,100
Oh,

638
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,460
we're here!

639
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,080
We can fill up!

640
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,860
Accept the gas amount and pay.

641
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,980
Reset the gas...

642
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,460
How do I...

643
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,440
How do I know how much?

644
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,680
How much...

645
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,800
How much am I putting in?

646
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh, gas 100%.

647
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
Okay, nevermind, hold on.

648
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,740
Hold on, reset.

649
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,500
Let's do...

650
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,880
85%.

651
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,880
Look at that.

652
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
To the brim.

653
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,120
No, we only have $75!

654
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,160
We need to find a way to make money first.

655
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,520
A road trip with Minto would be peak?

656
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,680
You think so?

657
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,160
Okay.

658
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,720
We need to make money first.

659
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,850
We can enter in here.

660
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,430
What do we got?

661
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,750
And we can get new stuff for...

662
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,450
Like, look, I used my...

663
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,710
We can get an actual hula dancer.

664
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,990
Okay, I know I said that we needed to save money, but...

665
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,710
I know I said we needed to save money.

666
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,850
Remove one thread at start of road during night.

667
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,590
Chewing gum?

668
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,910
Which I think I used already.

669
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,290
I used their chewing gum.

670
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,990
Get discount at gas stations?

671
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,270
Coffee?

672
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,130
Ciggies?

673
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,830
Cool shades?

674
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,180
Save money so we can get hula...

675
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,720
I mean, we can get a hula dancer right now.

676
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,800
Does she fit in here?

677
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,410
Got to put her in my glove compartment.

678
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,750
How do I make her...

679
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,710
I'll set on my dashboard.

680
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,030
She sit like right here?

681
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,710
Or you can get cool shades.

682
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,790
What is this?

683
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,450
Aspirin.

684
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,410
Cures headaches.

685
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,270
I feel like that might be a good thing to have.

686
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,030
We have so much beer.

687
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,670
Protects against... Wait!

688
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,010
That's a car upgrade.

689
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,510
Wait, that's kind of huge, right?

690
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,670
Right click on her?

691
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:54,890
Use.

692
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,150
Right click to lower...

693
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,170
Rotate.

694
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,330
Rotate.

695
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,790
Oh yeah.

696
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:10,810
You should crack open a couple of cold beers and experience the average Australian's Wednesday morning.

697
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,690
What?

698
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,650
I say that as a South Australian.

699
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,510
There's nothing better to do in this state on a Wednesday morning.

700
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,090
Sending this from my car, by the way.

701
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,210
Good morning!

702
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,550
Drunk driving.

703
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:23,850
No!

704
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,970
We're responsible.

705
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,010
I'm gonna get this.

706
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,650
I think this is gonna be huge.

707
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,250
This is gonna save our butt.

708
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,570
I think.

709
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,970
It's big.

710
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,490
It's big, big, but I think we should.

711
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,850
Why would I...

712
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,450
Use from the... During events removes threat warnings.

713
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,590
But it's all... It's triple X.

714
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,830
The discount?

715
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,030
What was the discount one?

716
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,410
This one gets discounted.

717
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,490
We're spending all our money here.

718
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,030
This is how...

719
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm trying to understand.

720
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,010
This... Wait, do we sell stuff?

721
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,630
Like, if I sold this beer, would I get 15 dollars?

722
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,290
Oh, I think I can sell my guitar.

723
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,690
And we get 50.

724
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,030
I see.

725
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,390
I'm trying to see if...

726
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,390
Like, this has three...

727
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,510
This flashlight has unlimited uses.

728
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,390
So I think it would be good to have...

729
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,610
If we're riding at night.

730
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,670
No, we're not gonna sell the guitar.

731
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,850
I'm just saying hypothetically.

732
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,230
If we are, you know, about to die.

733
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,030
But I think this would be good to have.

734
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,400
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

735
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,860
We've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes.

736
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,780
It's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.

737
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,740
Hit it!

738
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,280
What's the rope do?

739
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,720
A rope can always come in handy.

740
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,560
Okay.

741
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,060
Doesn't really tell me anything.

742
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,220
Is it probably some story point or something?

743
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,620
I imagine.

744
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,600
Mint Watch Blues Brothers.

745
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,140
I'm a soul man.

746
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,020
I'm a soul man.

747
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,640
Coming to ya.

748
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,640
On a dusty road.

749
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,760
Good lovin'.

750
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,420
I got a truck load.

751
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,440
And when something...

752
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,480
Oh gosh, I sang that in elementary school.

753
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,780
I was in a play.

754
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,960
And it was like one of those like...

755
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,920
Modern takes of a fairy tale.

756
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,180
But with modern music.

757
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,860
And they made me and another girl a blues brother.

758
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
And they were like, isn't it funny?

759
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,980
Because you're not brothers.

760
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,780
And you're not even sisters.

761
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,760
I was like, okay.

762
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,240
I still remember the song even now.

763
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,560
Okay.

764
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,720
Maybe we'll get an aspirin.

765
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,660
I'm trying to get like the things that might, you know, like...

766
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,280
Maybe we do get the rope.

767
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,880
But I also want the flag.

768
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,700
Dashboard figurine.

769
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,760
Let me put her in my dashboard.

770
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,840
Like this looks like a perfect spot for her.

771
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,580
Or maybe the torch.

772
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,060
I mean the flashlight.

773
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,700
Oh no, I'm starting to speak like an Aussie.

774
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,280
No?

775
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,880
Actually, do they say torch in Australia?

776
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,100
I know they say torch in Britain, right?

777
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,960
The flag for sure.

778
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,820
Okay, we'll get the flag.

779
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Can't get the rope though.

780
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,320
We say torch too?

781
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:09,740
You do?

782
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,600
Okay.

783
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,680
We can get also...

784
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,700
Oh, I only have 8 dollars.

785
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,600
Okay, nevermind.

786
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,120
We're leaving.

787
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,920
We're done.

788
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,500
Yeah, we're broke.

789
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,280
We're broke!

790
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,760
Rainbow!

791
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,940
Is the rainbow a threat?

792
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,000
Why?

793
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,280
What is the rainbow attacking me for?

794
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,520
Did you grab a slushie and circus peanuts?

795
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,180
Circus peanuts!

796
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,900
Dang, my energy.

797
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,620
But we get extra energy.

798
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,920
So we're actually pretty good.

799
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,600
Next energy is reduced to zero.

800
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,760
Stop for hitchhiker or keep driving?

801
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,820
I'm gonna stop for the hitchhiker.

802
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,280
Hello!

803
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,840
How are you doing?

804
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,340
Wait, is that a red block B-21?

805
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,640
I used to work at a garage.

806
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,760
But I got so tired of repairing all those new heaps of junk.

807
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,200
I needed to get away.

808
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,620
You got space?

809
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,540
He's a mechanic!

810
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,080
Wait...

811
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,660
A good looking guy with a bunch of tools.

812
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,820
I should be scared.

813
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,620
But his easy manner and quiet voice puts me at ease.

814
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,800
Can you die in this game?

815
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,120
I wonder.

816
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,960
An ally?

817
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,740
Girl, you have the membership card.

818
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,890
He looks at my car and asks about the engine.

819
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,170
After a drag of a cigarette, he returns to inspecting the car.

820
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,760
So, do I let him in?

821
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,520
Right click to lower seat.

822
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,940
Oh my gosh, I can get more room!

823
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,750
We had more space this whole time.

824
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,230
What do I do with this?

825
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,530
How do I let him in?

826
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,610
Oh, there we go.

827
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,890
Oh, new.

828
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,770
Automatically restores one durability when you reach your destination.

829
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,870
Cool!

830
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,410
Oh my gosh, so the hitchhikers also give you skills and stuff?

831
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:00,850
Okay.

832
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,230
Okay, okay, okay.

833
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,610
Here we go.

834
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,020
The music is so nice.

835
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,360
Your car needs work.

836
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,140
Okay.

837
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,480
Sorry.

838
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,060
I don't have the money.

839
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,380
I have 8 dollars to my...

840
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Oh, another tractor!

841
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,700
But we're stronger now.

842
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,740
You

843
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,160
can click on the portraits of your passengers to see their skills.

844
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,480
He's got that.

845
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,300
Maybe if we get rid of...

846
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,380
If I got rid of these two, then we could use his skill.

847
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,300
Let's try it.

848
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,030
Perfect.

849
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,350
Now?

850
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,560
Okay.

851
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,740
Oh no!

852
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,090
I'm still gonna use it.

853
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,320
Nice.

854
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,680
Okay, nothing's gonna hurt us though.

855
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,980
I'm running low on energy.

856
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,240
Okay.

857
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,780
Oh, and they gain experience?

858
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,520
Plus one tired.

859
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm tired?

860
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
I got some skill points.

861
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Don't forget to open your journal to learn new skills.

862
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,660
You can access your journal from the car menu.

863
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,580
Oh, and if you're out of skill uses, you should probably rest.

864
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,420
Max energy reduced by one.

865
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,700
No, I'm tired!

866
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,420
How do I...

867
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,740
How do I...

868
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,420
How do I unlock this?

869
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,820
Unlock.

870
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Unlock.

871
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm clicking.

872
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,860
Oh, I gotta hold it down.

873
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,100
Okay.

874
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,000
What's this?

875
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,320
Oh, we got a blue tire now.

876
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:04,940
Good, good.

877
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:07,800
Okay.

878
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,340
Very nice.

879
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,400
Good job everybody.

880
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,260
Should we rest?

881
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,660
Durability minus one.

882
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,500
We have a mechanic.

883
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,240
Let's rest.

884
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,920
Why does that lower my durability?

885
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,100
I don't quite understand.

886
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,720
Now we're dirty!

887
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,640
Hitchhikers gain less EXP.

888
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,140
Are you kidding me right now?

889
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,700
I've got like no money.

890
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,760
There's more here.

891
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,200
Wait.

892
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,520
Oh, there's lots here.

893
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,460
What kind of upgrade did you get there?

894
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,060
Not bad.

895
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,460
But if you want, I can help you pick out some better parts.

896
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,140
I've got some ideas for how we can make her a real beauty.

897
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,600
Okay.

898
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,980
I've got a quest added.

899
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,060
That's right.

900
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,140
Can I use this?

901
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:07,960
Or...

902
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,160
How does this work?

903
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,380
How does it...

904
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,560
How does it work?

905
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,360
Can I put her in my...

906
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,160
Can I put this in here?

907
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,240
What is this for?

908
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,080
Enter the garage.

909
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,260
Okay, let's try it.

910
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,560
Enter.

911
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,060
Welcome to the garage.

912
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,960
You can install upgrades and customize...

913
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,500
Okay.

914
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
It's also the place to repair your car.

915
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,860
I don't want to sell it.

916
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,120
I want to use it.

917
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,120
Customize, shop, repair.

918
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,580
Customize.

919
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,600
Maybe here?

920
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,740
Interior.

921
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,860
Crocodile alligator.

922
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,900
I drive a Chevrolet movie theater.

923
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,380
I see, I see, I see.

924
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,080
Utility.

925
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,900
Oh my gosh, we got her in there.

926
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,940
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

927
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,400
Okay, this doesn't go in anywhere.

928
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,180
Can this?

929
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,320
We're making space, we're making space.

930
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,920
This is perfect.

931
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,000
Nice.

932
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,700
Nice, nice, nice.

933
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,480
Choose the type of service.

934
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,460
I don't have money.

935
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,540
Budget repair.

936
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,040
Mechanical system.

937
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,940
I don't know what any of this is though.

938
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I think our car is not so bad right now.

939
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:47,780
Right?

940
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,060
Probably pretty okay.

941
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,740
Gets a discount at garages.

942
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,150
Use the glove box.

943
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,250
Mechanic guy will repair anyway.

944
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:06,950
It's true.

945
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,870
Oh, so I can access the upgrades from here.

946
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:12,990
Good to know.

947
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,190
Good to know.

948
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,510
Winter tires.

949
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,310
Uh-oh.

950
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,690
We're gonna need to get those eventually, right?

951
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,710
But we're far from winter.

952
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,390
I hope this doesn't turn into a national lampoon sort of vacation.

953
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,130
Where we get...

954
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,570
Lampooned?

955
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,610
Uh-oh.

956
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,230
Please place me in your glove box.

957
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,770
I have space.

958
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,090
What's in this mini-mart?

959
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:52,670
We got fresh bananas, watermelon, chocolate, cigarettes, fruit candy, carrots.

960
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,110
Orange!

961
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,490
Orange, you glad I didn't buy a banana?

962
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:04,930
Soap!

963
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,730
Wait, it says we're dirty.

964
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,070
We can use the soap.

965
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,030
It's only $1.25.

966
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,270
We're clean now.

967
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,210
Or we will be.

968
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,270
We will be.

969
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,120
Alright.

970
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,000
Nice.

971
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,020
Let's see if this food mart has anything special.

972
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,660
They have the thing that we have already.

973
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,400
And another hula.

974
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,500
And chips.

975
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,080
Steering wheel.

976
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,460
Makes you immune to the stress status?

977
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,940
I don't have enough money for it, but I didn't know there was a stress status.

978
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,320
Steering wheel sleeve.

979
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,700
Steering wheel sleeve.

980
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,520
My car is not in very good shape, so it doesn't look nice right now.

981
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,500
But I've always wanted to make my car inside very cute and fun.

982
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,660
Like have the steering wheel cover and the seat cover.

983
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,620
You already have an interior upgrade though?

984
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,040
I think you can have multiple, no?

985
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,900
Oh, this is roof.

986
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,280
Nevermind, yeah, you're right.

987
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,400
So it's either one or the other.

988
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,580
This is much better, I would say.

989
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,260
Than aesthetics.

990
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,600
Always wanted a cover.

991
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,060
I've always wanted a cover.

992
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,560
I'm a menace on the road.

993
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,980
Oh my god.

994
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,180
Oh wow, the hula gets faster when you drive.

995
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,580
Watch.

996
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,500
Hold on, back it up.

997
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,720
You're good, you're good.

998
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,140
I'm gonna get sickness from this.

999
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,900
So, you guys...

1000
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,900
We must now...

1001
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,080
Decide our route.

1002
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,480
Maybe here, game of the year.

1003
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,860
Wait, there is a... Oh wait, what's down here?

1004
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,900
How do I see...

1005
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,080
Our... Is it under journal?

1006
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,240
No...

1007
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,360
How do I see our missions?

1008
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,420
Only thing missing is an Itasha option.

1009
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:31,780
True.

1010
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,080
I'm at work right now taking care of traffic signs.

1011
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,540
Make sure to appreciate the traffic signs.

1012
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,780
Cause someone's gotta fabricate and maintain them.

1013
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,000
Have a safe trip and let me meet the horned lizard.

1014
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,780
Have a good day at work.

1015
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,160
We'll buff out those scratches.

1016
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,660
Oh, calendar.

1017
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,280
Thank you.

1018
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,700
This one.

1019
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,620
Highway star.

1020
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,680
The mechanic wants to build the perfect car.

1021
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,360
Gather and install the parts that he wants.

1022
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,120
Install rally wheels, rally spoiler, roll cage...

1023
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,240
This is my car!

1024
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,780
Excuse me!

1025
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,800
This is my car!

1026
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,740
This guy is coming in and like...

1027
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,360
Actually, hold on.

1028
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,940
I'm gonna move down this a little bit.

1029
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,060
It's a bit better.

1030
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,460
God forbid he went through a school zone.

1031
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,320
It's our car.

1032
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,220
But it's his dream.

1033
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,640
I mean, if he pays for it, that'd be great.

1034
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,530
Does this place have any of the stuff that he wants?

1035
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,390
Rally wheels!

1036
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,610
Rally wheels!

1037
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,170
Events start on rough roads.

1038
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,650
Remove one durability threat.

1039
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:56,150
I'm sure we'll come across another car mechanic garage place.

1040
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,110
Can I make a minty Tasha?

1041
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,090
In this game?

1042
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,990
Probably not.

1043
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,790
But...

1044
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,010
Oh wait, nonononono.

1045
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,930
We have to decide where we're going.

1046
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,430
How do we make money in this game?

1047
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,290
I don't want to sell my guitar!

1048
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,410
So we could go down here.

1049
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,990
This is the festival.

1050
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:20,970
Maybe...

1051
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,190
But then what's up here?

1052
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:25,830
Two gas.

1053
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,250
515.

1054
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:30,810
445.

1055
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,450
This one seems better, no?

1056
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,270
There are places to work.

1057
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,310
Oh, I see.

1058
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,250
We just haven't run into one yet.

1059
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,830
Select work from legend.

1060
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:44,950
Oh, I see.

1061
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,040
Does this place have work?

1062
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,280
It does.

1063
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,260
What places on the way have more work than none?

1064
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,080
Hold on.

1065
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,620
So if I click...

1066
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,760
I'm not quite sure why there's a pin in these.

1067
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,720
Get a ticket.

1068
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,480
Oh, we have to go to a place to get the ticket.

1069
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,180
That's right.

1070
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,100
We have to go to a big city.

1071
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,920
Maybe we go to this one because there's more stops along the way.

1072
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,260
No?

1073
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,460
We could get...

1074
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,580
Wait, what's down here even?

1075
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,140
Another place.

1076
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:26,440
Okay.

1077
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,630
But we have all this along the way too.

1078
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,590
Maybe we'll be fine.

1079
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,330
This place has some place to work.

1080
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,330
We'll go here.

1081
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,970
Wait, hold on.

1082
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,010
What's this one?

1083
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,070
Car shop.

1084
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:49,230
Gas.

1085
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,030
Yeah, I think we should go make some money, honey.

1086
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:53,710
Or we could go here.

1087
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,140
What's... I'm trying to see what the legend is.

1088
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,820
Oh, garage.

1089
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,960
Work.

1090
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,740
Gas.

1091
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,820
Let's go here.

1092
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,420
Café pub also has works in the daytime.

1093
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,120
I see.

1094
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,420
Let her run a bit before you accelerate.

1095
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,760
Look at our little flag.

1096
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,920
We have a red flag on our car.

1097
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,050
You guys, the mobs are gonna come out.

1098
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:31,490
The zombies.

1099
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,530
Where's the music?

1100
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,710
It's kinda spooky.

1101
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,870
Kinda creepy scary.

1102
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:44,890
Potholes.

1103
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:49,970
Oh,

1104
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,200
nice.

1105
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,720
I was gonna use this.

1106
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,960
Let's see.

1107
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,100
We'll get rid of this one.

1108
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,380
Oh, just kidding.

1109
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:03,960
Sorry, sorry.

1110
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:04,860
I'm an idiot.

1111
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,380
This one.

1112
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,120
There we go.

1113
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,120
Nice suit.

1114
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,840
And this one.

1115
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,000
Unlucky.

1116
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,160
All threat to attack.

1117
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,320
Unlucky?

1118
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,220
Who am I lucky?

1119
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,360
Am I lucky?

1120
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,720
We're fine.

1121
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,440
Oh, I need to put in a new CD.

1122
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,220
Oh, I see.

1123
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,480
We're in the zone.

1124
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,900
Gas decreased by 25%.

1125
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,460
Nice.

1126
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,980
That's huge.

1127
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:34,820
CD.

1128
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,610
Oh, I don't have another CD.

1129
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,010
Eject.

1130
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,270
We only have the crystal boys.

1131
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,030
Oh, wait.

1132
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,870
Night life.

1133
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:47,950
Let's try this one.

1134
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,840
I hope you guys like night life.

1135
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,620
Vague lanes.

1136
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,480
I didn't realize that it was...

1137
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,340
If only they were switched.

1138
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,400
We can use an energy.

1139
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,570
How many more uses do I have on my cigarettes?

1140
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,730
Oh, 12 out of 12.

1141
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,570
I guess we'll use the free one.

1142
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,090
Music is blasting from the car stereo.

1143
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,420
It is a vibe though.

1144
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,320
Just finished another semester of college.

1145
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:06,900
Not done yet.

1146
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,760
But thank you for being the unending source of joy and enthusiasm, Mirai.

1147
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,400
You encourage me so much just by being yourself.

1148
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,340
I love ya.

1149
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,160
Amen!

1150
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,300
EPM?

1151
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,760
What is that?

1152
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,300
Congratulations!

1153
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,220
Another semester down, baby.

1154
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,720
Getting rid of that actually kind of...

1155
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,700
Didn't work in our favor here.

1156
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,550
Ouch!

1157
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,830
I'm in the zone.

1158
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,170
No, I'm in the zone!

1159
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:46,690
Unlucky.

1160
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,850
Aw, man.

1161
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,040
Dang it, maybe I should have wasted the energy.

1162
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,060
Oh, I can't use that.

1163
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,260
OK.

1164
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,460
It's 1 AM.

1165
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,460
I put the first music I purchased online on a CD and never took it out of the car moment.

1166
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,140
Alright, so we got our garage here.

1167
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:15,960
Employment office!

1168
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,860
Farm work.

1169
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,440
Need a steady hand at our ranch?

1170
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,260
We'll pay well.

1171
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,180
Cafe staff needed.

1172
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,340
Janitor work.

1173
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,000
I think...40, OK.

1174
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,640
40 for 12 hours versus 45 for...

1175
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,100
And then this is less...oh wait.

1176
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,740
This is less energy too.

1177
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,760
But like, we get 75, but it's 24 hours.

1178
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,440
Cafe staff, I think.

1179
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,510
It's the same amount of energy as the janitor.

1180
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:59,450
5 more extra dollars.

1181
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,210
We need the cash, baby.

1182
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,710
Farm will eat all your energy, it's true.

1183
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,710
Holy cow!

1184
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,690
We have some chocolate.

1185
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,390
Unfortunately, I accidentally wasted one earlier.

1186
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,970
We are tired.

1187
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,870
Not just sleepy, we are tired.

1188
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,290
We could get the rally wheels.

1189
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,210
A car jack allows you to switch tires anywhere.

1190
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:36,990
Interesting.

1191
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:38,930
That would be good for winter, right?

1192
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,070
We could get the rally wheels.

1193
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,550
Super wide.

1194
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,410
Gain 1 armor.

1195
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,310
What is this one?

1196
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,710
The rally wheels removes 1 durability...I think that's pretty good, no?

1197
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,990
If it removes 1 durability threat at the beginning?

1198
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,710
Oh wait, on rough roads.

1199
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,350
Oh, nevermind.

1200
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,950
Gotta be on rough roads for you.

1201
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,190
But it's for the mission, no?

1202
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,890
Should we not try to complete his mission?

1203
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:21,050
Rally wheels, rally spoiler, roll cage, servo.

1204
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,750
What do we get?

1205
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,790
Actually, what do we get if we complete this?

1206
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,850
It doesn't say.

1207
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:30,850
It's kind of frustrating.

1208
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:31,910
What if it's not worth it?

1209
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,190
What is servo?

1210
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,330
Police spray?

1211
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,110
Wait, we can eat Tasha in our car?

1212
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,690
Servo is power steering.

1213
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,290
Jerry can.

1214
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,650
Expensive.

1215
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,370
We can change the color of our car.

1216
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,690
Don't do red, it'll pull you over.

1217
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:05,530
One way to find out the reward, I guess so.

1218
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,410
We get a nod of approval.

1219
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,270
You don't have to finish the quest.

1220
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,450
That's true.

1221
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,790
I do think maybe having a super wide tire would be good.

1222
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,890
I'm just so curious with the quest.

1223
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,170
It does, you know?

1224
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,430
So curious.

1225
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,510
Do we want to waste half our money on new tires?

1226
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,290
But it's armor.

1227
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,400
But red is 19% faster.

1228
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,630
You might have other quests, so it's up to you.

1229
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:39,870
True.

1230
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,370
Let's get the tires.

1231
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,540
Customize.

1232
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,100
Can I sell these now?

1233
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,820
For zero dollars!

1234
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:58,960
Messed up.

1235
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,240
I don't get any money for it.

1236
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,300
I should sleep, someone can please sleep.

1237
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,160
Please go to sleep.

1238
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,340
This is a chill stream.

1239
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,940
You don't have to sell them.

1240
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,660
I guess we could have a spare, huh?

1241
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,840
But I don't...

1242
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,940
Let me rotate it.

1243
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,360
Let me...

1244
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,860
Let me rotate it.

1245
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,580
Let me rotate it.

1246
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,000
Rotate.

1247
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:26,960
There we go.

1248
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,700
I'm going to put a seat down.

1249
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,320
We can always put it back up, you know?

1250
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,300
Rex the badger!

1251
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,180
Thanks for the 10 gift.

1252
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,100
Thank you so much.

1253
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,720
Thank you, thank you.

1254
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,940
We'll do what we can everybody.

1255
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,660
To not sell the guitar, okay?

1256
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,400
We'll do everything we can.

1257
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:00,890
Oh, my bad.

1258
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,270
13 dollars.

1259
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,630
It's great to chill with Minto as the hours melt away.

1260
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,270
Ducky, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1261
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,470
Sell the car and hitchhike.

1262
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,370
Oh my gosh, PHC!

1263
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,550
So close to leet.

1264
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,010
Should we try for leet?

1265
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,170
1550.

1266
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,910
Exactly 75%.

1267
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,190
Right now we're about half full.

1268
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:58,030
In fact, I'm even going to go a little less.

1269
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,170
We're going to go like 60%.

1270
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,190
I think it's okay.

1271
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:05,830
Yeah, I think that's fine.

1272
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,010
I keep seeing someone up here.

1273
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,310
It's kind of spooking me.

1274
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:30,850
Lottery ticket?

1275
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,310
Wait,

1276
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:42,990
where did you see the cat?

1277
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,170
Let's go gambling!

1278
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,010
Oh, in the window.

1279
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,310
Ah, I see.

1280
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,630
I'm also flying out to Japan in a couple of days for 2 weeks stay slash holofest.

1281
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,310
But I gotta say I'm pretty nervous as it's my first time out of NA.

1282
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,810
What would you consider the most important tip for a first timer?

1283
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:09,770
Oh my gosh, FLEX!

1284
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,690
Wait, are you going by yourself?

1285
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,570
Are you going... You're going to be meeting up with friends though, right?

1286
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,810
If you're meeting up with friends you'll be totally...

1287
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,510
Hot dog!

1288
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,450
Yippee!

1289
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,670
I had to get the hot dog.

1290
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,270
It was a dollar.

1291
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,440
Yeah, by myself meeting some people for a fest but mostly solo.

1292
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,460
I go solo all the time.

1293
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,300
It's kind of refreshing.

1294
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,280
Not gonna lie.

1295
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah, just have a safe trip and enjoy.

1296
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:59,440
If something goes wrong, like if you're like, oh, I want to do this thing.

1297
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,540
You get lost or something happens.

1298
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,200
The time thing, you know, lots of things can go wrong.

1299
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,940
But just kind of go with the flow with trips.

1300
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,820
That's the easiest thing to do.

1301
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:23,900
I find it, especially traveling, solo is to not have too rigid of an itinerary and just go with the flow on things.

1302
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,120
Oh,

1303
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,260
I just realized all the notice are all the way...

1304
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,740
Sorry, the notice are going to stay on that side because I'm lazy.

1305
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,380
Hot dog moment.

1306
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,880
If only we got the hot dog.

1307
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,680
Let's go gambling.

1308
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,300
I'm gonna move that here and we're gonna go gambling, baby.

1309
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
Okay, let's go.

1310
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,360
Let's go to another place with a job.

1311
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,640
So down here.

1312
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,980
Hans Town.

1313
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,400
Because I kind of want to go to here.

1314
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,780
Or we could go up.

1315
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,360
It's hard to say.

1316
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,270
Why is... What is this?

1317
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:33,070
Why is that... Oh yeah, this area too is also...

1318
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,870
I don't quite know what it means.

1319
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,270
Big travel tip, don't forget your wallet.

1320
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,520
Yes, that is a... Oh, city limits I see.

1321
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,820
That is a big travel tip indeed.

1322
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,980
Don't forget your wallet.

1323
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,480
Or your passport.

1324
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,380
Which I didn't forget that.

1325
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,100
But I did forget my wallet.

1326
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,440
There's only gas stations from here.

1327
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,200
Let's see, if we go to Hans Town.

1328
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,860
There's also only gas stations for a long time.

1329
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,640
Okay, maybe we should go up instead.

1330
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,960
We'll go to Torli and we can head up a couple of places too.

1331
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,390
Oh wait, hold on.

1332
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,350
I'm an idiot.

1333
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:32,450
I didn't have them marked.

1334
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:32,950
Hold on.

1335
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,010
I didn't have them marked.

1336
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:36,690
Okay, hold on.

1337
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,030
Oh, see, see, see.

1338
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:41,210
We can go exploring and traveling.

1339
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,390
We can go hiking.

1340
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,430
Can we go hiking up here?

1341
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:46,230
Yes.

1342
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,750
What do you guys... What do you guys think?

1343
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,830
Should we go to Torli or should we go to Hans Town?

1344
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Which do you think?

1345
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,340
Hiking sounds fun.

1346
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,020
Also, what is this one?

1347
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,400
Oh, cafe pub.

1348
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,100
Wait, we can work there.

1349
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,000
Is there a cafe pub down here?

1350
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:18,880
Yes.

1351
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,480
And there's hiking.

1352
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,040
Let's go to Hans Town.

1353
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,540
Because I want to go to Skokopo.

1354
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,460
Let's go.

1355
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,080
Hiking sounds great, especially with you in a sundress.

1356
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,610
I hope your intentions are pure.

1357
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,130
I don't know.

1358
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,490
Do you guys like nightlife?

1359
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,910
Oh, sorry, I keep...

1360
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,230
Abandoned car.

1361
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,490
Interesting.

1362
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:06,650
Wait a minute.

1363
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,230
Is this a threat?

1364
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:12,870
Why don't we just go around it?

1365
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,790
Just go around the car.

1366
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,470
OK, nevermind.

1367
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,410
No, I can't use this one.

1368
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,250
OK, we'll use this one.

1369
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,050
Nice.

1370
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,490
My energy!

1371
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,050
My energy!

1372
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,350
Holy moly.

1373
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,770
I'm going to eat the chocolate bar.

1374
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:47,090
I forgot that uses a turn.

1375
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,040
This is messed up.

1376
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,830
It didn't work!

1377
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,570
Why didn't it work?

1378
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,000
Can he do anything?

1379
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,600
Oh, he can!

1380
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,700
Only works on the money symbol.

1381
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,640
Groovy Jesus.

1382
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,580
He's handsome.

1383
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,020
And scrap.

1384
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,780
Maybe someone wants to buy it.

1385
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,460
We got some more stuff.

1386
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,180
Just found a VR game called Sushi Ben.

1387
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,960
And there's a female character who only walks on... Oh yes, I know that game!

1388
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,540
Oh, this car can't race.

1389
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,640
Not yet.

1390
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,260
We're finally on the last one!

1391
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,260
OK, what do you guys want to listen to?

1392
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,580
We got Crystal Boys.

1393
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,460
Shuffle.

1394
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:09,520
Tigers!

1395
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,490
Yeah, I remember Sushi Ben.

1396
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:25,890
I almost tried to do like... They did like an open audition for voice actors.

1397
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,250
Hell yeah, we're going to stop for the Hitchhiker.

1398
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:29,270
Hitchhiker?

1399
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,470
Oh.

1400
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:33,910
Hey.

1401
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,110
Can I get a ride with you?

1402
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:38,890
The sleeper.

1403
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,150
Poor guy, looks like he just woke up.

1404
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,790
He told me he has a condition where he just falls asleep all of a sudden.

1405
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,090
Anywhere, anytime.

1406
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,390
At least I know he's pretty and harmless.

1407
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,510
Why do we keep calling him pretty?

1408
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:59,870
What does he do?

1409
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,470
Gain 4 armor?

1410
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:02,910
Fall asleep.

1411
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,870
Falls asleep at times.

1412
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,750
The first backseater.

1413
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,110
Look!

1414
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,090
Hey, great timing.

1415
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,250
I just woke up.

1416
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,130
We are tired.

1417
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:27,770
We should rest.

1418
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:37,530
Introspection.

1419
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:41,750
F... Freak, is that a crack or some dirt on my windshield?

1420
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,570
Pick at it with your finger.

1421
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,810
Doesn't matter if it's a crack, it's a crack.

1422
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,410
Pick at it.

1423
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,030
Do it.

1424
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,140
But what if it's a crack?

1425
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,680
It'll make it worse.

1426
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,020
You're driving though.

1427
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,560
True, what if we crash?

1428
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,980
Check it.

1429
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,840
It's just some... It's just some snot or something.

1430
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,180
Must have sneezed hard.

1431
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,900
Nasty.

1432
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,440
Night falls.

1433
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,920
How close are we to the city?

1434
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,540
Oh, just kidding.

1435
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,320
We are hungry and we are tired.

1436
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,420
Rusty's Autopilot.

1437
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:48,260
Holy mo...

1438
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,100
He's got a tent!

1439
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,460
That's the optional thing we need.

1440
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,340
Upgrade?

1441
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,580
Which one would be better?

1442
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,440
The hula girl or the groovy Jesus?

1443
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,460
Let's sell the scrap.

1444
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,160
Rusty is goaded.

1445
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,580
Wait, how much is... Hold on.

1446
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,880
How much is the hula dancer?

1447
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,540
Wait, we even have a mechanic bobble head!

1448
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,240
He's so cute.

1449
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,260
Very nostalgic.

1450
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,060
Hula girl is a classic.

1451
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:26,660
So true.

1452
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,440
We can eat the hot dog.

1453
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,020
To get rid of my hunger.

1454
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,940
Sell the wide tires.

1455
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,400
But my wide tires!

1456
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,920
Subwoofer!

1457
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,980
GTI decal.

1458
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,840
Purely cosmetic upgrade.

1459
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,740
Oh, we get some stickers.

1460
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:48,540
Cute.

1461
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,900
Valentine's spray.

1462
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,700
Wait, this is a car spray?

1463
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,800
Good roof rack.

1464
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,540
Adds extra inventory space.

1465
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,180
Put things in the hot dog!

1466
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,700
Toe hook.

1467
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,700
Does nothing.

1468
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,160
Exhaust pipe.

1469
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,700
Reduce gas drained on motorways by one, but not lower than one.

1470
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,520
More stickers.

1471
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:17,800
AC.

1472
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,700
Makes you immune to both the cold and hot status.

1473
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,320
Cheap roof rack.

1474
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,840
It's literally a shopping cart.

1475
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,400
A fender.

1476
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,780
Wow, there's a lot of stuff here.

1477
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,480
This is kinda crazy.

1478
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,220
I'm gonna get the valentine's spray.

1479
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,320
Can I use it?

1480
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,480
I can't get the hula girl off.

1481
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,840
Check your upgrades.

1482
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:48,660
Yeah?

1483
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,900
Let's see what else we got here.

1484
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:57,880
Gas station.

1485
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:58,760
Employment!

1486
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,580
Cafe staff.

1487
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,700
The farm work.

1488
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,920
We have six energy.

1489
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,700
I think we'll do the cafe and then we'll rest.

1490
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,920
The sun rises.

1491
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,340
We're tired.

1492
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,840
Very tired.

1493
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:33,840
Sleep?

1494
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:33,960
Sleep?

1495
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,320
Oh my gosh.

1496
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,640
Back to being hungry and dirty.

1497
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,090
Let's grab like a snack in here.

1498
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:58,190
This is probably good to have the drink that restores three energy.

1499
01:14:59,050 --> 01:14:59,970
Also makes you tired.

1500
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,930
Wait, what do you mean?

1501
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,590
Get more glizzy.

1502
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:04,530
I wish.

1503
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,550
Oh wait, we have glizzy.

1504
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,990
Use.

1505
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,390
Awesome.

1506
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,470
And we're dirty and we have soap.

1507
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,170
Awesome.

1508
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,970
We're so good.

1509
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,000
Chips.

1510
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:23,880
Let's buy some chips.

1511
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:25,720
How much?

1512
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,060
Oh, I forgot to sell the scrap.

1513
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:27,720
We can do that.

1514
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,520
Lottery ticket.

1515
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,040
You scammed me!

1516
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,980
I feel so scammed from the lottery ticket.

1517
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,020
I'm not gonna lie.

1518
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,740
The tent.

1519
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,400
Where can we put this?

1520
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,480
We can make space.

1521
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:02,820
Easy.

1522
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,740
What does the beer do?

1523
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,360
Oh.

1524
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,150
I'm happy.

1525
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:17,530
I'm drunk.

1526
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,610
I have limited time during road events.

1527
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,290
Dead all thanks to the 20 gifted.

1528
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,030
Guys, I think I'm playing on hard mode.

1529
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:38,110
Last brain cell.

1530
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:39,790
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1531
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,010
Thank you.

1532
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,450
We're probably good on gas for now.

1533
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:48,830
I think.

1534
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,890
We got drunk off of one beer.

1535
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:54,270
We're such a lightweight.

1536
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,010
What does this mean?

1537
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,170
Why is it bouncing all around?

1538
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:07,590
I'm confused.

1539
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,350
We gotta get a ticket.

1540
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,430
We're going to game of the year.

1541
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:20,370
Oh wait, no.

1542
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,430
We're going to...

1543
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,890
We're going to...

1544
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,430
Right?

1545
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:29,690
Actually, I don't remember.

1546
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,270
Where are we?

1547
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:32,690
Yeah.

1548
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,250
We went to Hunstown.

1549
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:42,800
Don't vomit.

1550
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,440
Let's leave.

1551
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:49,860
Oh, it's a cat.

1552
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,460
I see him.

1553
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,140
Wait, where am I going?

1554
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,740
I think

1555
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,190
I accidentally went in a place and I don't know where we're going.

1556
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:15,310
Speed cameras!

1557
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:16,370
Oh gosh.

1558
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,510
Don't get... Please.

1559
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:26,570
Oh my god.

1560
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:30,430
This is perfect.

1561
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:30,990
This is perfect.

1562
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,670
Wait, why didn't it get rid of it?

1563
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,770
Why didn't it get rid of it?

1564
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,410
There we go.

1565
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,010
Perfect.

1566
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,820
Did we get money?

1567
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,940
You shouldn't be driving.

1568
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,480
You shouldn't be driving.

1569
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,440
I'm scared.

1570
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,060
What does this mean?

1571
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,660
What does this mean?

1572
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:00,720
What does this mean?

1573
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,800
My gas!

1574
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:07,540
Oh my gosh.

1575
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:08,680
No, my gas is low.

1576
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,840
Try to strike a pose for the camera.

1577
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,560
Guys, are we about to die?

1578
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,900
The mechanic has reached level 2.

1579
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,300
Check out their new skills from the trunk menu.

1580
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,560
What's your skills?

1581
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,640
Game 2 durability.

1582
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:36,580
Let's go.

1583
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,000
Cost is free.

1584
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,320
Awesome.

1585
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,500
Will consume some of your cigarettes.

1586
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,520
Energy.

1587
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,740
I don't have any energy drink.

1588
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,060
I only have chips.

1589
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,180
Could sleep.

1590
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,940
You can't until you get to a town.

1591
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,400
It's all over for us.

1592
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,420
I'm never gonna make it to the festival.

1593
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,120
My friends!

1594
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,220
Oh, stop for the hitchhiker.

1595
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,020
Hey man.

1596
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,620
You wouldn't... Oh, I'm not happy anymore.

1597
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,630
You wouldn't mind driving me around or, you know, to my next gig?

1598
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:46,190
I'm on this tour, you see.

1599
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:47,370
And I don't have a car.

1600
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:48,470
Never got a license.

1601
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,290
The songwriter.

1602
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:54,590
Change target threats warning into a note.

1603
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:58,650
Need space for your inventory for his guitar case.

1604
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,190
Excuse me, I have my own guitar.

1605
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:04,150
I have my own guitar.

1606
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,610
No, I can't.

1607
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:06,630
I don't have room.

1608
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:16,150
If I let him in...

1609
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:20,990
I'm gonna have to kick you... Wait, I think I'm gonna have to kick him out.

1610
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:25,770
Can I put your... Oh no!

1611
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:26,270
My guitar!

1612
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,170
He has a cat?

1613
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:30,870
He does!

1614
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,490
We have to...

1615
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,680
Why is it so... Dump the beer?

1616
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,980
It's only done us not good, huh?

1617
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:55,840
It's only... It's only damaged us, huh?

1618
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,640
Dump the tire.

1619
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:00,380
My spare!

1620
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,300
Hold on, we'll figure this out.

1621
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,080
We'll figure this out.

1622
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,840
We'll figure this out.

1623
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,760
Here, I'm gonna put all the skinny things.

1624
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,120
Pick up your feet, everybody!

1625
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:18,240
I don't feel like we can afford to not bring on new people right now, though.

1626
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:27,470
Look at me.

1627
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,890
You might call me a genius.

1628
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:38,980
Tetris master.

1629
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,060
Let's go!

1630
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,090
Right on.

1631
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:49,690
Thanks again.

1632
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,910
Stoked to see you had some space for my guitar.

1633
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:57,050
It was... Uh-oh, our gas is really low.

1634
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,450
Wait, uh-oh.

1635
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:02,270
Oh no!

1636
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,810
Hold over by car!

1637
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,170
I'm not drunk anymore.

1638
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:08,930
Yes, I am.

1639
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,810
It's all over for us, everybody.

1640
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,150
Sayonara.

1641
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,400
Sayonara.

1642
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,900
What card do you have?

1643
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,820
A swift skill.

1644
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,900
Wait, the thing is still going down!

1645
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,700
Gain an extra turn when you get a perfect hit.

1646
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,740
Wait, what do you have?

1647
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,720
Oh my god, you're asleep.

1648
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,740
I just lost my turn.

1649
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,640
All hitchhikers are asleep!

1650
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:01,420
Plus sad.

1651
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,610
The hearing took 10 hours.

1652
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:15,570
You were bored out of your mind.

1653
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:17,370
You pleaded not guilty.

1654
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:22,470
The late summer sun cast brownish shadows as the jury stared at you equally bored.

1655
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:26,230
You end up spending three months in prison before making bail.

1656
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,790
Your parents are ashamed, but happy you are home again.

1657
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,610
Life goes on.

1658
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,560
I had one beer.

1659
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,200
No!

1660
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,320
Oh, I unlocked the trunk!

1661
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,180
I mean, the truck.

1662
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,800
New starting loadout.

1663
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,820
Shady things.

1664
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:12,140
Ok, so we messed up that one, but...

1665
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,680
Busted.

1666
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:17,440
We went to jail.

1667
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,480
At our first playthrough.

1668
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,060
That's, you know...

1669
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,900
Why am I such a lightweight?

1670
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,460
One beer is too many, Minto.

1671
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,680
Never drink and drive.

1672
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:36,940
No!

1673
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:37,940
I don't drink!

1674
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,320
A festival.

1675
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,960
One day we'll get to the... Failure!

1676
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,240
Ok!

1677
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,220
We got jailed, but we did not get failure, everybody.

1678
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,660
Top of the world.

1679
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:48,560
Hard worker.

1680
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,740
The great race.

1681
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,340
The cabin.

1682
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,260
Inheritance.

1683
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:52,820
Rehab!

1684
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,480
It can get worse.

1685
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,160
Holy moly.

1686
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:58,540
Ok, new game.

1687
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,620
Now I see why it's a roguelike.

1688
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,880
Jail is better than failing.

1689
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:05,980
We went to jail!

1690
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,200
And we probably got a sick tattoo in there.

1691
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:09,960
You know?

1692
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:18,200
The summer stretches out before your memory, as you try to relive your big trip.

1693
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,700
It was the early 2000's, right?

1694
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,960
You had your license for a while, but hadn't decided on a car yet.

1695
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,420
You're young.

1696
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,340
For what it's worth, you have time.

1697
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,600
The tattoo is that...

1698
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,580
Is that emoji, yeah.

1699
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,680
Let's go with the truck this time.

1700
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,240
We'll get less...

1701
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,860
What's the words?

1702
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:54,980
We'll get less hitchhikers, but we'll have plenty of space.

1703
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,900
Paying for my Oshi's bail.

1704
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:01,420
Actually though, we had a lot of space when we folded down the seats.

1705
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,420
We kind of had the best of both worlds with the other car.

1706
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,680
I'm still unemployed.

1707
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,800
I think the restore one additional energy is pretty good actually.

1708
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,600
Nice anti-DUI PSA commercial, Mingi.

1709
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,320
Paying for my Oshi's bail.

1710
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,780
We're not gonna have a guitar and beer though.

1711
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,420
Sorry.

1712
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,860
I played on hard mode my first run.

1713
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,060
Let's go with...

1714
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,420
Let's go with the mom's care package.

1715
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,250
Keep previous upgrades?

1716
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:57,830
Wait, wait.

1717
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,030
No, I did not mean to do that.

1718
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:00,430
Wait.

1719
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:03,250
That's so awesome.

1720
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:05,370
Wait.

1721
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,650
And it's average truck.

1722
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,490
Trunk.

1723
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:10,530
Average engine.

1724
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,270
This is the same.

1725
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:12,790
It's also an average engine.

1726
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:15,650
So...

1727
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,170
Roguelike moment.

1728
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,750
Let's take our sedan again.

1729
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,750
Let's give her one more shot.

1730
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,030
Don't forget your letter.

1731
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:37,250
Wait, I got the stuff, right?

1732
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:39,990
Wait, hold on.

1733
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:41,790
Get a tent.

1734
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:44,150
OK, festival.

1735
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:47,810
Don't leave.

1736
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:48,930
There we go.

1737
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,090
My care package, mom!

1738
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,200
OK, we're fine.

1739
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,080
OK.

1740
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,940
Let's go.

1741
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,220
OK.

1742
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,220
I wonder who we'll run into this time.

1743
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:17,420
I didn't really get to see the point of the sleepy man and the musician man.

1744
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,160
But the mechanic guy was good.

1745
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:24,260
Something on the roadside.

1746
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,560
We didn't get a tractor this time.

1747
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,200
It's a briefcase?

1748
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,200
Nice.

1749
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,740
Wait, but we're durable.

1750
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,200
We didn't really take any damage.

1751
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:52,820
Look at that.

1752
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,120
Nice.

1753
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:58,700
Is it full of money?

1754
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,420
I sure hope so.

1755
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,560
It's full of...

1756
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,200
Gas!

1757
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,800
It's full even.

1758
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:08,760
Huge.

1759
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,020
I feel that I will have to add this band to my playlist.

1760
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,620
It's so good.

1761
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,320
Gas, gas, gas.

1762
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,040
Oh no, tractor moment.

1763
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,500
Makes a peaceful humming sound.

1764
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,380
What is this?

1765
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,520
Protects you from one attack.

1766
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:40,520
Oh, it's the armor!

1767
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,020
Disappears after the event.

1768
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,330
The power S.

1769
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:52,630
Nothing happens.

1770
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,340
If only these were switched.

1771
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,030
More attacks this turn.

1772
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:10,830
Why is he so threatening?

1773
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:12,970
Scary.

1774
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:19,550
Oh, I realized we don't have our hitchhiker guy, so we don't have it anymore.

1775
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,210
We don't have the blue attacks right now.

1776
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,130
Something on the side of the road.

1777
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:28,630
Another one?

1778
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,100
Admit it, you dance in the car.

1779
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,780
Oh, I can't use this?

1780
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,220
Seriously?

1781
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,120
Rude.

1782
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,990
Four uses per reset.

1783
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,510
Ah.

1784
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,050
Does Minda actually drive?

1785
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:12,590
I do.

1786
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,630
I have a license.

1787
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,370
And I drive.

1788
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:19,710
What did we get?

1789
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,810
A trumpet.

1790
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:27,900
Okay.

1791
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,420
A license.

1792
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,480
We didn't get a hitchhiker this time.

1793
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,200
Sad.

1794
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,780
Wait, who are you?

1795
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,660
Hey, what's up dude?

1796
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,020
Glad to see another fellow road tripper out here on the road.

1797
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:56,320
Where are you off to?

1798
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:00,840
What?

1799
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,100
What does this mean?

1800
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,600
What does this mean?

1801
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,960
No freaking music.

1802
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,980
We are tired.

1803
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,280
Let's see.

1804
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,740
No, don't get the beer case.

1805
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,340
It's a trap.

1806
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:32,960
It's a trap.

1807
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,600
Do not get the beer case.

1808
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,260
It's an absolute trap.

1809
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,320
Why does the juice make you tired?

1810
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:52,820
What is it?

1811
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,780
A sugar crash maybe?

1812
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:58,340
Wait.

1813
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,580
Restores two energy and cures one stack of tired.

1814
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,660
Wait, we can get this.

1815
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:03,320
How much is this?

1816
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:03,640
Hold on.

1817
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:04,620
Two dollars?

1818
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,620
Yeah, there we go.

1819
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:08,580
That's pretty good actually.

1820
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,200
Beer o'clock.

1821
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:12,540
No!

1822
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,560
There's not much here, so we can leave.

1823
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,080
We can just keep going.

1824
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,020
God, that was a big save.

1825
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,040
Let's listen to it.

1826
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:27,240
Subject.

1827
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,760
Fucking werewolf ass.

1828
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,060
Okay.

1829
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,700
We'll just shuffle it, you know.

1830
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,480
Let's hear it all.

1831
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:41,840
Oh, that's what that means.

1832
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,240
Okay, shuffle means all of it.

1833
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,240
Having a rough day at work.

1834
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,680
No!

1835
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,440
Rest in good space.

1836
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,500
Recommend Death Road to Canada.

1837
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:51,940
Oh.

1838
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,860
Okay.

1839
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,260
Alright, play!

1840
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,180
It's a little more tame than I expected.

1841
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:19,560
Hey!

1842
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:20,860
Oh, this is...

1843
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:22,760
Oh,

1844
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,940
this one is so good!

1845
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,350
Is she saying to spread your legs?

1846
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,580
I'm in the zone.

1847
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,440
Who are you?

1848
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,960
Help me out, brother.

1849
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,460
I always wanted a brother.

1850
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,240
Hitchhiking with my brother.

1851
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,900
I've been running for five hours straight.

1852
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,380
My legs can't hold me up no more.

1853
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:17,280
I'm innocent.

1854
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:18,620
Wait, what?

1855
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,700
You gotta trust me.

1856
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:21,400
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1857
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,180
The convict?

1858
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:30,740
I probably shouldn't have acted on the saying, don't judge a book by its cover, when stopped for an escaped prisoner.

1859
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:31,420
But I did.

1860
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:37,780
Besides his stressed out demeanor, there was a cool kindness hiding behind his eyes.

1861
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,230
Trust me, bro.

1862
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:45,770
He's 4B.

1863
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:49,950
Hitchhikers won't sit next to the convict.

1864
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:51,310
That's okay, he'll be in the front seat.

1865
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:54,550
Wait, so do we get money every time we use the cash thing?

1866
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:03,900
Do you think, though, if I get pulled over, it's over for me?

1867
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,920
Oh, he uses that money!

1868
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,380
Oh, hell no.

1869
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,160
Wait, seriously?

1870
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,300
No.

1871
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,900
Cost 10 cash?!

1872
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,170
I thought he was gonna rob the people.

1873
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:31,970
Supplies!

1874
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,750
We ain't affordin' that.

1875
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:38,890
Hell no.

1876
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,330
Time to use my inducted.

1877
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,410
Can I

1878
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,800
recharge this again?

1879
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,780
Don't I have to, like...

1880
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,000
I have to go to sleep, right?

1881
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,530
I have to rest?

1882
01:37:59,610 --> 01:37:59,770
Okay.

1883
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,690
Next place we'll rest.

1884
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,140
We're hungry and we're tired.

1885
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,720
It's okay, we've got...

1886
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,800
We've got a hotdog!

1887
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,780
What else is here?

1888
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:26,040
We've got food mart, save mart, auto mart.

1889
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,360
Okay.

1890
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,980
Back it up, back it up, back it up.

1891
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,360
Let's get more hotdogs.

1892
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:36,140
This place doesn't sell hotdogs!

1893
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:43,090
Horrible service!

1894
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,390
They got some $3 nuts!

1895
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:47,850
Okay, we got chips.

1896
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,800
Maybe here, maybe at save mart.

1897
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,080
They got some cheese.

1898
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:59,300
6?!

1899
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,420
Tuna?

1900
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:02,980
Potato!

1901
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,120
You'll need to cook these.

1902
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:07,820
Pizza!

1903
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:08,220
Cowabunga!

1904
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:14,630
Can I sell the trumpet?

1905
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:15,950
Who wants this?

1906
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,690
Toilet paper, removes dirty.

1907
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:18,570
Oh, this is good too.

1908
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:21,070
Okay, now we can sleep.

1909
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:23,190
And we'll get a banana.

1910
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:24,310
Oh wait, we have a banana.

1911
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,150
We'll get more banana.

1912
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:26,650
Double banana.

1913
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:29,310
Here's hungry, not meant for humans though.

1914
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:34,750
I'm gonna get more...

1915
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:39,410
We'll get more chocolate.

1916
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:45,280
And I'm gonna... What's cheaper?

1917
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:46,280
Chewing gum?

1918
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,700
Let's get the cigarettes too.

1919
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,400
Sleep!

1920
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:57,140
Good night!

1921
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:03,730
Do I still have my... Oh I'm cold!

1922
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:05,530
Why am I cold?

1923
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,750
When you take damage during events, also take 1 durability damage.

1924
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:25,990
Got something hot to drink.

1925
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:29,250
Oh, we gotta get something hot to drink, huh?

1926
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,250
Maybe like a coffee?

1927
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,470
Maybe here?

1928
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:37,190
Nothing?

1929
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,770
Seriously?

1930
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:42,910
Also do I have the... Oh I don't have my flashlight anymore.

1931
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:46,390
I think we should get that too.

1932
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:55,270
Let's see what you got here.

1933
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,770
Car upgrade by utility front.

1934
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,410
Get a discount.

1935
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:08,850
We currently have the super wide tires, but we don't have any other tires.

1936
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:12,450
That's fine for now, maybe.

1937
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:19,810
H-O-T-T-O-G-O I need a hot drink to go!

1938
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:22,210
Well...

1939
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:25,590
I guess we'll just have to go for it.

1940
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,840
I think your ex doesn't mark treasures.

1941
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,120
What an interesting band.

1942
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,040
Where are we off to?

1943
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,200
Where are we off to?

1944
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,060
We can go hiking here!

1945
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,660
It's all I've ever wanted.

1946
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,360
It's all I've ever wanted to do!

1947
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,360
What's this one?

1948
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,380
Is that...

1949
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,020
Oh, not a shop.

1950
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:04,720
Oh, sleep!

1951
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,620
We can sleep here.

1952
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,620
No, no, no.

1953
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,200
We can go hiking here too.

1954
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,940
We can go hiking here!

1955
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,380
Try my first chocolate Japanese snack.

1956
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:19,780
That's great.

1957
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:20,920
Would you try?

1958
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,780
I'm looking around still.

1959
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,200
Hold on.

1960
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,150
We can also go hiking here.

1961
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:53,410
Skopolis.

1962
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,490
Sorry, I'm not used to the legend yet.

1963
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:03,330
Oh, that's a cafe.

1964
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:05,990
We're gonna have to get work soon too, huh?

1965
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,050
Let's see, what's the places with work?

1966
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:12,690
Work, work, work...

1967
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:14,790
This place has...

1968
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,950
Work!

1969
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,690
Let's go.

1970
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:18,690
Let's go home.

1971
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:36,790
We slept the whole day away and now we're partying at night.

1972
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:41,070
If my brakes break now, I'd be effed.

1973
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,970
So effed.

1974
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:45,610
I don't even think this car has airbags.

1975
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:47,410
Our brakes are fine, right?

1976
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:48,010
Test them.

1977
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,530
They do feel a bit squishy.

1978
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,310
I should get them checked out.

1979
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,520
A werewolf!

1980
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,680
I should recommend this fan to Bao maybe.

1981
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:18,880
Imagine if she did a cover.

1982
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:20,680
Speed cameras!

1983
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:21,560
It's okay.

1984
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:22,800
It's okay guys.

1985
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,240
We're not drunk.

1986
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,180
We're not drunk this time.

1987
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,100
Follow the rules.

1988
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,380
I am, I am, I am.

1989
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,410
We're okay.

1990
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:49,850
More attacks this time.

1991
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,710
We're fine, we're fine.

1992
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,650
We can get through this.

1993
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:54,250
If only I had my lottery ticket.

1994
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,560
I know the lottery ticket would have been so good there.

1995
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,480
Oh well.

1996
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,780
Money threats are really bad in this game.

1997
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:09,780
I can imagine.

1998
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,200
Oh, we're more introspection.

1999
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,000
I wonder what my parents were doing at my age.

2000
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,240
Probably just studying.

2001
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,640
I don't think they ever really got a chance to travel much.

2002
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:25,240
It must have been so much easier to go out on a new road trip those days.

2003
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,360
Let's say I don't think they really had a chance to travel much.

2004
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:30,660
And we're traveling.

2005
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:31,680
We're living the dream.

2006
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,280
Or they just won't tell me about it.

2007
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,940
I can imagine it was kind of wild back then.

2008
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,320
Are we sad now?

2009
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:40,920
What did I do?

2010
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:50,880
Potholes.

2011
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:57,500
Okay, all threats are set to attack.

2012
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:02,500
Oh, wait.

2013
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,800
The duct tape is perfect there.

2014
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,960
No, the duct tape.

2015
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,180
The duct tape.

2016
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:08,640
There we go.

2017
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:09,980
Nice.

2018
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,200
Actually, we can do this one.

2019
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:16,740
Nice.

2020
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,270
Wait, I already listened to this song.

2021
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:25,530
Eject.

2022
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:27,430
I don't really like this one as much.

2023
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,390
Let's just shuffle stuff.

2024
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,190
Yeah, this works.

2025
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:43,910
Nightlife.

2026
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:45,710
Wait, did it actually pick nightlife?

2027
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:50,230
Introspection.

2028
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,830
I'm so happy I fixed the stereo before I left.

2029
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,290
Imagine if I had no music.

2030
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:59,590
It's definitely one of the most important things in a road trip.

2031
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:01,330
A hundred percent.

2032
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:04,930
It makes everything cooler.

2033
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:08,790
Inspired.

2034
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,090
Next energy cost is reduced to zero.

2035
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,730
Lose this when used.

2036
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:17,910
Now we're tired.

2037
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:20,050
We're at our cafe.

2038
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,550
Explore?

2039
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:24,750
Wait, can we do that at night?

2040
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:26,150
Maybe that's not wise.

2041
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:27,070
Okay, hold on.

2042
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,590
Maybe that's not very wise.

2043
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:31,870
There's like nothing here.

2044
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:33,490
Hmm.

2045
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,240
Can I get at the garage?

2046
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,320
Oh yeah, we can customize.

2047
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:44,960
Okay, cool.

2048
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:48,840
Oh,

2049
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:53,480
I didn't get anything new, did I?

2050
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,340
Dang it.

2051
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:57,240
What's this?

2052
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:57,780
Chocolate.

2053
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,280
Oh yeah.

2054
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,580
I didn't get anything new.

2055
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:01,860
Are we hungry?

2056
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:02,820
We're tired.

2057
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:07,240
My squishy brakes, how do I fix them?

2058
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,420
Oh, repair.

2059
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:13,380
The budget repair is free.

2060
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:15,120
Does it fix brakes?

2061
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:17,380
Rust removal.

2062
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,240
None of this says brakes.

2063
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,340
Mechanic fun times.

2064
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,340
I'm not paying for that.

2065
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,660
It's literally free.

2066
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,820
Car is already in good enough condition.

2067
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:32,660
Full repair only.

2068
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:33,320
What?

2069
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:42,770
Should we try?

2070
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,070
Or was that just an introspection?

2071
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:47,270
Was it just for funsies?

2072
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:49,770
Pay the mechanic.

2073
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:51,490
Are we not needed?

2074
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:52,250
I think so too.

2075
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:56,980
No!

2076
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:57,900
Okay, we'll sleep.

2077
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,180
We'll sleep.

2078
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,100
We'll work.

2079
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,000
We'll explore.

2080
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,800
The sun is rising.

2081
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
We're hungry.

2082
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,940
It's okay, we can...

2083
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,220
We'll eat a pizza.

2084
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:19,820
Now we're not hungry.

2085
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,100
Cowabunga baby!

2086
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,580
Choose your own adventure.

2087
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:32,240
Okay, so we can go to the right, which is the important thing.

2088
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,140
Or the left, which is the red thing.

2089
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,260
Or straight.

2090
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,760
See, this has big letters and this has red letters.

2091
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:42,740
I think the red letters might be kind of crazy, right?

2092
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:44,360
Oh, wait.

2093
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,080
Oh, just kidding.

2094
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:54,310
It's kind of scary out here.

2095
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:55,510
I'm not going to lie.

2096
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:59,050
Do we have a limited amount of...

2097
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,230
What's that sound?

2098
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,990
The vines are blocking your way forward.

2099
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:10,890
You light up the cave with your flashlight!

2100
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:13,050
Good thing I got it!

2101
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:17,560
What is that?

2102
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:18,660
What's that sound?

2103
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,360
Can I get lost in here?

2104
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:30,180
You found an item!

2105
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,520
Return to starting position to claim it.

2106
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,320
Okay, what did I find?

2107
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,220
This is so scary.

2108
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,440
We can't go through the vines.

2109
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,340
What's this way?

2110
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,420
Can we find other items?

2111
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:01,060
Just go straight.

2112
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,880
You found an item!

2113
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:03,480
Nice.

2114
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:08,560
I just stole from an abandoned... question mark?

2115
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,840
I found an item!

2116
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:11,780
Okay, this should be good.

2117
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,040
I got three things.

2118
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,480
I think maybe we can get max...

2119
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,480
I actually don't know.

2120
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,280
I'm lying.

2121
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:22,480
I have no idea.

2122
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,400
Vines are blocking my way forward.

2123
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,840
I have to not get lost.

2124
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:36,160
I made it!

2125
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:39,520
You claim the items you are carrying.

2126
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:40,880
Receive all claimed items when you...

2127
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,140
Nice!

2128
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:43,460
Okay, okay.

2129
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,220
We are losing energy?

2130
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,020
Is that what we are losing?

2131
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:48,800
What are we losing?

2132
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:49,800
You used up three energy.

2133
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,000
I see.

2134
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,660
I think we might have hit the jackpot, baby.

2135
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,060
I think we might have hit the jackpot!

2136
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,300
Nice, fine.

2137
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,600
Let's put our magazines in the backseat.

2138
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:21,340
For nobody to... We'll put them amongst the berries.

2139
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,600
We can sell the spilled coffee, I guess.

2140
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,080
I don't know.

2141
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,140
Jerry can full!

2142
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,220
We'll never have to buy gas!

2143
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,020
This is great!

2144
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,180
And a thermos.

2145
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:36,040
That's huge too.

2146
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:40,980
This run is goated right now.

2147
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:41,900
This is so awesome.

2148
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,240
So much free gas!

2149
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:48,620
That was so worth!

2150
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,400
New skill tree.

2151
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:50,880
Hiking.

2152
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,540
Available for all future playthroughs.

2153
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:59,020
I see.

2154
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,060
So these are for...

2155
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,380
Right click to see the details.

2156
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,060
Gain two armor.

2157
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,020
Interesting.

2158
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:07,580
Okay,

2159
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:12,300
let's see.

2160
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,700
What is... We can shop here too?

2161
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:17,660
Oh my gosh!

2162
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,300
I can get like pie and...

2163
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,500
Wow, blueberry pie.

2164
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,240
I'm gonna sell the spilled coffee.

2165
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,060
Thank you.

2166
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,900
I really like the hiking skill, yeah.

2167
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,100
Let's see.

2168
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,560
How can we make some money here?

2169
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,560
Earn extra today.

2170
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:40,880
Become an ad warrior.

2171
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,100
You need to drive around with our advert for warrior.

2172
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:47,480
Oh, that's so easy!

2173
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:48,580
We can do that.

2174
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,300
Oh my gosh!

2175
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:53,960
We e-toshed our car!

2176
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,920
We e-toshed our car!

2177
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:02,610
Fardorf.

2178
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:04,170
Our cat Cookie is missing.

2179
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:05,050
Has anyone seen her?

2180
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:16,870
Where's our... Where's our...

2181
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,600
Wait, how do I... There we go.

2182
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,420
Where are we?

2183
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,020
Farsdorf?

2184
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,120
Where the hell is that?

2185
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:37,540
Where... Oh, Fardorf!

2186
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,160
That's where we are.

2187
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,800
No, we are at Honlagrad.

2188
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:46,380
Right?

2189
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,960
We need to go to Fardorf.

2190
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:56,410
Oh, I could have just clicked the map.

2191
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:57,130
I'm such an idiot.

2192
01:54:59,730 --> 01:55:00,850
That's where we came from.

2193
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,030
It's not that far at all.

2194
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:03,550
I think we can do it.

2195
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:06,290
We'll go.

2196
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:07,750
Pizza!

2197
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:09,670
We're short on staff.

2198
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,650
And we need someone to deliver pizzas.

2199
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:15,330
In Fardorf?

2200
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:16,290
Actually, we're going there.

2201
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:17,590
Nevermind, we'll accept it.

2202
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:25,670
Oh, we gotta make space.

2203
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:27,650
This is fine.

2204
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:29,770
We have no hitchhikers right now.

2205
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,400
A Wraith?

2206
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,460
Yarrow, thanks for the Wraith!

2207
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:38,360
Thank you!

2208
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:40,900
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2209
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,020
We're playing this game.

2210
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:42,940
We're going to Fardorf.

2211
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,140
Yes, Fardorf.

2212
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:51,420
To Fardorf.

2213
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:52,320
Yes!

2214
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:57,320
It's like... Hi Wraithers!

2215
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:57,580
Hello!

2216
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:07,700
This is a roguelike, item management, RPG, road trip game.

2217
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:10,660
Ducky digs for the gift.

2218
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:13,620
And we're just vibing to some good tunes.

2219
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:19,810
And, yeah.

2220
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:22,250
Majestic Falcon?

2221
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:26,350
Are we fighting a bird?

2222
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:27,490
What the hell?

2223
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:30,490
What am I doing?

2224
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:31,810
I'm fighting the bird.

2225
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:32,870
What does this mean?

2226
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:37,750
This threat will give you one random negative status effect.

2227
01:56:58,900 --> 01:56:59,380
Perfect.

2228
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:00,400
I think we're good.

2229
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,800
It means it doesn't take your resource, but it gives you a debuff.

2230
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:05,460
I see.

2231
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,740
We're fine.

2232
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,200
We fought the bird and we succeeded, I think.

2233
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:13,080
I think we succeeded.

2234
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:19,590
Introspection.

2235
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:22,550
It feels like some parts of the world have better clouds than others.

2236
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:28,010
I hope I find a place with really big clouds.

2237
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:30,030
Thick, illuminated, majestic.

2238
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:32,350
What did I get for the bird?

2239
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:33,770
Inspired?

2240
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:34,870
Maybe?

2241
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:35,830
I don't know actually.

2242
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:39,570
The best places are always up in the mountains or in the fields.

2243
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:43,110
I want the big cumulonimbus clouds.

2244
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:47,510
You continue driving with a small smile of purpose.

2245
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:50,630
We're in the zone!

2246
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:52,090
Oh my gas!

2247
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:58,390
Guys, we gotta use our jerry can soon maybe.

2248
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:02,090
Big clouds.

2249
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:04,590
Vague lanes.

2250
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:07,090
On the highway?

2251
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:08,530
That seems really bad.

2252
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:11,290
I think we don't want that.

2253
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:16,050
Perfect time for this one.

2254
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,800
Good thing we are prepared.

2255
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,120
And yes, we are prepared.

2256
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,360
My tsikies!

2257
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:42,130
Running out of gas will also do 4 durability damage and make you sad.

2258
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:45,230
Best to fill up... Have you guys ever run out of gas before?

2259
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:47,110
I once did.

2260
01:58:49,110 --> 01:58:52,490
I once ran out of gas and a nice lady...

2261
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:56,210
She helped me out.

2262
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:56,770
I like.

2263
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:00,330
Nope, but close.

2264
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:03,450
Forest tranquility?

2265
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:04,970
Why is that a bad thing?

2266
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:09,010
Let's use the duct tape.

2267
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:15,730
Perfect.

2268
01:59:20,030 --> 01:59:21,870
We live on E.

2269
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:22,830
No!

2270
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:28,490
I was going up a hill and I ended up...

2271
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:32,930
Running out of gas so it was bad.

2272
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,980
Got close a few times.

2273
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:44,800
Living life on the edge.

2274
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,380
But I'm not alive so...

2275
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,480
Roadkill!

2276
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:49,360
Why did we stop for the roadkill?

2277
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:50,440
Excuse me!

2278
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,680
What's wrong with me?

2279
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:02,170
Oh we are dirty!

2280
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:04,230
Because of roadkill.

2281
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:05,950
Because we stopped for the roadkill.

2282
02:00:06,370 --> 02:00:07,310
Why did we do that?

2283
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:08,950
Lunch?

2284
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:09,310
Dinner?

2285
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:09,990
No!

2286
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:20,410
What?

2287
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:26,750
Let's clean ourselves up.

2288
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:28,350
Oh wait.

2289
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,310
Actually we have no hitchhikers.

2290
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,830
I don't care.

2291
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:31,810
Let's remain dirty.

2292
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:34,510
What does the porn magazine do?

2293
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:37,650
Excuse me.

2294
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,190
I have an addiction.

2295
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:43,910
I must stop and read the porn on the side of the road.

2296
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:46,530
Found in the forest.

2297
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:47,770
It doesn't do anything?

2298
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:49,750
We are just collecting it?

2299
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:49,990
OK.

2300
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:51,430
I like it.

2301
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:56,050
Missing cat!

2302
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,320
Where is my cat?

2303
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,640
Did I do it?

2304
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:14,790
Wait, do I need to find the cat?

2305
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:14,890
What?

2306
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,620
You got my pizza?

2307
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,480
Oh yeah, I do.

2308
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:36,590
I never actually found the cat.

2309
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:40,650
Pizza is my passion in life.

2310
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:41,610
So true.

2311
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:44,610
Oh, I thought the cat was here.

2312
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:50,050
How do I find the cat?

2313
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:55,960
Wait, I'm kind of confused.

2314
02:01:57,420 --> 02:01:58,280
Am I dumb?

2315
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:14,100
Maybe that was the roadkill?

2316
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:14,380
No!

2317
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,300
No, no, no, no.

2318
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,980
You find it randomly in events like the exploration or otherwise.

2319
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:25,680
Beer can.

2320
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:29,880
Why does the ravioli need to be cooked?

2321
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:30,920
It does not.

2322
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,260
You can eat it straight from the can.

2323
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:34,980
Let's see.

2324
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,940
I have plenty of events there.

2325
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:40,380
Let's get some aspirin.

2326
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:44,240
We have plenty of food so I don't need to get food for a while.

2327
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,740
But maybe some chewing gum.

2328
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:54,880
Maybe.

2329
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:02,470
What else is in here?

2330
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:11,170
Right now we can't change our car color.

2331
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:13,210
Because we are in advertisement.

2332
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:17,710
The cat.

2333
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:18,890
So I can't find...

2334
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:21,910
I can't see it.

2335
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:23,670
If I see it, I can't click on it.

2336
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:25,350
Does this...

2337
02:03:25,350 --> 02:03:27,810
Wait, does this...

2338
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:28,670
Missing cat.

2339
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,610
It doesn't seem...

2340
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:34,050
But it says I returned the cat.

2341
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:39,800
Oh, you can.

2342
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:41,060
The advertisement is a decal.

2343
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:41,540
Oh, OK.

2344
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:42,140
I see, I see.

2345
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:46,680
No, we are not selling the goods.

2346
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,700
What are you talking about?

2347
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:49,200
Oh, it's a glitch?

2348
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:50,280
Oh, I see, I see.

2349
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,680
It doesn't seem to be a...

2350
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:03,180
Time limit on it.

2351
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:05,280
So I guess we'll go back and go search.

2352
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:07,340
What we can do... Watch this.

2353
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,190
Is we go back...

2354
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:14,850
To Honda guide.

2355
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:18,350
And we hike and maybe we'll find him.

2356
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:20,510
Oh yeah, let's refill my gas.

2357
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:21,570
Thank you for the reminder.

2358
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:26,470
Actually, I'm just gonna use the gas station.

2359
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:28,570
Actually, no.

2360
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:29,870
We have so much gas.

2361
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:40,440
Jerry can lol.

2362
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:43,060
Gain 2 gas.

2363
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,160
Nah, we're fine.

2364
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:49,120
So we're gonna go back and we're gonna go look, right?

2365
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,000
The cat quest has a 9 day limit.

2366
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:53,780
Oh, it does?

2367
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,190
Let's go try.

2368
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,290
Let's go see if we see him.

2369
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:15,020
Maybe we'll get a hitchhiker this time.

2370
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,560
More introspection.

2371
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:22,480
It's wild to think about how many people live and work driving on these roads.

2372
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:28,390
So many people drive such incredibly long commutes for work.

2373
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:39,480
I mean, bless all those truck drivers and bus drivers that drive all around the world.

2374
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:45,300
It must be really cozy at times and really quite lonely as well.

2375
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:47,780
We're inspired.

2376
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:52,340
Let's see if we do the hiking.

2377
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,940
Oh, you can't change skills on the road.

2378
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:58,700
Nice.

2379
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,940
You say that, but you... I'm not attacking the tractor.

2380
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:04,080
It's attacking me.

2381
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,560
I promise.

2382
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,500
I'm gonna eat more goldfish, you guys.

2383
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,760
While we go over the potholes.

2384
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:20,860
I'm pretty relaxed right now.

2385
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,000
I found it on Booth.

2386
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:50,000
I couldn't tell you the store name right now, though.

2387
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:50,520
I'm sorry.

2388
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:54,160
But I think I just searched Sun Hat on Booth.

2389
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,410
Oh, our music.

2390
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:09,090
You guys, it's the crack again.

2391
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:12,810
We can't pick up the crack in front of the police.

2392
02:07:13,370 --> 02:07:13,610
Right?

2393
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:14,470
That would be so bad.

2394
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:24,730
There's nothing more relaxing than a long drive down a long, empty road once all the noise coming from the trunk stops.

2395
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:25,450
Wait, what?

2396
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:31,410
I'm gonna pick at it.

2397
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:34,950
Lucky.

2398
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:37,890
Plus one durability, baby.

2399
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:42,730
Oh, our music.

2400
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:45,530
Eject.

2401
02:07:47,330 --> 02:07:48,810
What's my darling you?

2402
02:07:52,190 --> 02:07:53,750
Oh, this one has a lot of songs.

2403
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:54,430
Okay, perfect.

2404
02:07:56,130 --> 02:07:57,210
My darling you.

2405
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,100
You got that song from being arrested?

2406
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:13,920
Oh yeah, that's right.

2407
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:17,320
We did get this song from being arrested.

2408
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,780
Everything alright.

2409
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,440
Oh, we're back to the roadkill.

2410
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,780
Why are we stopping?

2411
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:28,740
Unlucky.

2412
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,920
Oh, threat to attack.

2413
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:36,040
Oh, I can't use this now.

2414
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:36,840
Oh my gosh.

2415
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,220
We're in trouble.

2416
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:45,500
Perfect.

2417
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:45,720
Perfect.

2418
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:53,850
I'm trying to get to use the duct tape.

2419
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:57,390
Perfect.

2420
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,210
Are we gonna get attacked?

2421
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,620
This stupid... We gotta go sleep.

2422
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,800
We just stop in the middle of the road for the roadkill.

2423
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,580
What the heck did I eat?

2424
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:35,940
I thought it was going to be a tiny one.

2425
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:36,360
What?

2426
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,160
Did I just fart?

2427
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,020
I'm by myself.

2428
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,100
So it's fine.

2429
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:51,380
I gotta take better care of what I eat.

2430
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:53,740
We're satisfied.

2431
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:55,800
What does that give us?

2432
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,500
Energy cost decreased by one.

2433
02:09:58,020 --> 02:09:58,280
Okay.

2434
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,310
One skill point.

2435
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:09,430
Alright, let's open our journal and do the hiking.

2436
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:11,830
Uh...

2437
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:12,550
Game 2.

2438
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:13,650
Oh, that's right.

2439
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:16,110
Oh, we have so much!

2440
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,880
Changes targets with current road type.

2441
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:33,340
This one.

2442
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,140
Remove all armor.

2443
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,240
Destroy one threat for each armor lost.

2444
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:40,420
What?

2445
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:42,460
My armor?

2446
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:44,260
One

2447
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:10,770
threat for each skill used this event.

2448
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:20,540
I'm kinda still confused about the skill trees at the moment.

2449
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:26,080
Still a little trying to learn that at the moment.

2450
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,860
I'm going to go hiking.

2451
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:32,580
We're gonna go hiking and then we will...

2452
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,060
Alright, let's go find a cat.

2453
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,200
And then...

2454
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:44,560
We'll sleep.

2455
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:46,960
Yes!

2456
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:52,930
Alright.

2457
02:11:54,610 --> 02:11:55,070
Kitty!

2458
02:11:56,010 --> 02:11:56,990
Here, kitty, kitty!

2459
02:11:57,810 --> 02:11:58,890
Here, kitty, kitty!

2460
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:00,770
I found an item.

2461
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:01,630
It's a cat.

2462
02:12:02,530 --> 02:12:03,530
It's a cat.

2463
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:04,250
I promise.

2464
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:05,330
I heard it meow.

2465
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:06,870
Trust.

2466
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:09,290
Trust, it's a cat.

2467
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:12,390
I feel like I'm gonna get lost.

2468
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:13,790
I found a cat!

2469
02:12:14,070 --> 02:12:14,470
Trust.

2470
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:18,310
Why is there someone's abandoned car in here?

2471
02:12:18,750 --> 02:12:19,490
It's kinda scary.

2472
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,980
This area is so spooky.

2473
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:40,160
Three cats, yeah.

2474
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:42,020
We found cats.

2475
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:48,440
Okay.

2476
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:49,440
This way?

2477
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:54,120
Okay, now here's where I'm lost.

2478
02:13:00,590 --> 02:13:01,750
There's nothing in here?

2479
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:04,470
Okay, that's fine.

2480
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:08,670
I found another item.

2481
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:09,430
Nice.

2482
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:10,790
I'm lost.

2483
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:12,830
I'm a bit lost.

2484
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:14,110
We're fine.

2485
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:15,350
Are we lost?

2486
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:16,070
No!

2487
02:13:16,830 --> 02:13:17,830
Why would you think that?

2488
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:20,990
I know exactly what I'm doing.

2489
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:29,430
I'm here to tell you that I love you very much.

2490
02:13:29,490 --> 02:13:31,570
There's a massive blackout in my country.

2491
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,890
And I'm spending my last minutes watching your stream.

2492
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:34,530
No!

2493
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:37,810
No!

2494
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:38,650
07.

2495
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:39,190
No!

2496
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:48,780
07.

2497
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:50,180
No!

2498
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:52,580
You can sell this.

2499
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:53,980
Sell this.

2500
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,340
Sell this.

2501
02:13:55,420 --> 02:13:57,000
None of it was a cat, you guys.

2502
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:58,760
A mushroom.

2503
02:13:58,860 --> 02:13:59,560
You found it.

2504
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,780
You can put the chewing gum in.

2505
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:13,450
I'm still dirty, but we're okay.

2506
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:13,570
Okay.

2507
02:14:16,510 --> 02:14:16,990
Suspension?

2508
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:18,050
Or exhaust pipe?

2509
02:14:19,150 --> 02:14:19,870
More scrap?

2510
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,610
What do I do with the mushrooms?

2511
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:29,730
I have the most food ever.

2512
02:14:30,890 --> 02:14:31,970
You think it'll go bad?

2513
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:44,620
We have this now, the exhaust pipe.

2514
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:45,460
What does this do?

2515
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,440
Reduce gas on motorways.

2516
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:49,180
Why not?

2517
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:50,560
And then what was this?

2518
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:51,080
Suspension.

2519
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:53,200
Double the effect of your equipped wheels.

2520
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,800
Oh, I can only use one or the other.

2521
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:56,600
Oh no!

2522
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:58,920
Oh, I think this one is better.

2523
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:03,740
I think we should double the effect of our plus one armor.

2524
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:05,740
I believe.

2525
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:07,260
So we'll get plus two armor instead.

2526
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:08,680
Very good.

2527
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:16,720
Sell scrap.

2528
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:19,480
Nice.

2529
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:30,920
What is the point of the bandage?

2530
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,460
Remove threat warnings.

2531
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:36,900
That's what it does.

2532
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:39,160
Understood.

2533
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:41,920
I'm going to eat this candy bar.

2534
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,600
Just kidding.

2535
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,060
I'm going to eat it now.

2536
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:48,960
And then we're going to move this here.

2537
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:51,700
Move it here.

2538
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:52,280
There we go.

2539
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,980
The flag uses a utility spot too.

2540
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:01,800
I guess we don't really need it right now, right?

2541
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:08,460
The flag is a discount on gas.

2542
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:10,420
Yeah, so we can change it.

2543
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:11,720
Thank you for letting me know.

2544
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:16,120
Nevermind.

2545
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:20,180
Your thought process was great.

2546
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:24,280
Just the game denied you.

2547
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,120
Your purpose.

2548
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:28,940
I don't know guys.

2549
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,220
Should we go back to exploring again?

2550
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:32,700
Should we try again?

2551
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:34,640
Try for the cat?

2552
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:35,780
I don't know.

2553
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:38,880
Should we try for the cat?

2554
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:41,300
Looking for an extra...

2555
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:42,500
With a black car.

2556
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:44,300
I can paint my car.

2557
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:44,760
Black car.

2558
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:48,340
In Povil.

2559
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:51,860
Instruments?

2560
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,300
We need to get our...

2561
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:56,180
What do you need?

2562
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:59,680
Wait, I have a trumpet!

2563
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:03,560
Urgent help.

2564
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:06,260
My favorite band got stranded without money or gas.

2565
02:17:06,380 --> 02:17:07,540
Please bring them some gas.

2566
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:08,300
It's urgent.

2567
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,120
We get a skill point.

2568
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:20,480
Google says nothing about the cat sadly.

2569
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,820
Let's go one more time.

2570
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:25,200
Let's go one more time.

2571
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:26,140
I'm testing my luck.

2572
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,980
I'm testing my luck here.

2573
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:32,660
I actually like this part so much.

2574
02:17:32,780 --> 02:17:34,300
It's really fun.

2575
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:37,020
I really like the exploration.

2576
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:38,120
You guys know me.

2577
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:39,920
I love me a good hunt.

2578
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:48,240
I'm gonna get lost.

2579
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:50,100
I'm gonna get lost for sure.

2580
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:51,260
That's okay.

2581
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:01,840
Oh, it's already been looted.

2582
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:03,140
Oh, shoot.

2583
02:18:06,060 --> 02:18:06,860
Okay, okay.

2584
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:09,100
So it doesn't... It's not like a new...

2585
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:11,140
Yeah, yeah.

2586
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:12,600
Ah, I see, I see.

2587
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:12,860
Okay.

2588
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:14,760
Nah, man.

2589
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:16,340
Okay, let's go home.

2590
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:24,180
Wait, did I go in here?

2591
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:26,500
Yes.

2592
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:31,640
I'm not lost.

2593
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,180
I'm just...

2594
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:35,720
I'm being very thorough.

2595
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:36,360
Oh, shoot.

2596
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,160
I'm not lost.

2597
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:38,820
I'm being thorough.

2598
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:41,760
Don't worry about it.

2599
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:49,290
Just being thorough.

2600
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:52,750
Just being extra thorough.

2601
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:59,870
Just being super careful I didn't miss anything.

2602
02:19:00,090 --> 02:19:00,990
Oh, shoot.

2603
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:04,070
Yeah, yeah.

2604
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:05,370
Oh, see?

2605
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:06,950
I told you guys.

2606
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:09,070
And it's a cat.

2607
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:15,730
It's a different kind of cat.

2608
02:19:20,730 --> 02:19:22,870
Guys, we will never be hungry again.

2609
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:23,790
Trust.

2610
02:19:23,790 --> 02:19:27,070
We will never go starving ever again.

2611
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,390
I can't even fit all these berries.

2612
02:19:32,050 --> 02:19:32,450
Eat.

2613
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,780
I hope I don't get pulled over.

2614
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:46,920
I'll be really embarrassed.

2615
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:49,620
Never hungry, but plenty thirsty.

2616
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:54,660
And now we can distract the guards.

2617
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:55,280
So true.

2618
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:02,480
We can go hiking here.

2619
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:04,100
Let's go to Skopolis.

2620
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,720
And see if we can find the cat there.

2621
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,560
Our gas is...

2622
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:11,720
It's okay.

2623
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:13,760
Kinky minky!

2624
02:20:16,980 --> 02:20:19,260
Nah, it's just a lewd book.

2625
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:20,400
That's pretty tame, no?

2626
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,020
Everybody owns those.

2627
02:20:26,830 --> 02:20:28,090
I wanna hitchhike!

2628
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,850
I'm lonely!

2629
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:35,490
No, no, no.

2630
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:40,460
No flat tire.

2631
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,440
So what does this do?

2632
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:44,400
Gain 2 armor.

2633
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,360
How do I use it?

2634
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,620
Oh, I forgot to sleep!

2635
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:52,500
It's so over for us.

2636
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,000
I forgot to go to sleep.

2637
02:20:59,200 --> 02:20:59,920
It's okay.

2638
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:01,480
The armor is tanking it.

2639
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,040
All threats to attack!

2640
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:09,460
I really messed up, you guys.

2641
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:11,540
I messed up big time.

2642
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:15,520
I messed up big time.

2643
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:18,120
We have bandage.

2644
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:18,460
True!

2645
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:19,280
True, true, true.

2646
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:28,100
Give debuff to a 3 random threat.

2647
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:28,280
What?

2648
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:33,480
That was not good.

2649
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:48,600
What's our debuff?

2650
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,900
That was close.

2651
02:21:59,060 --> 02:21:59,240
Okay.

2652
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:02,360
Night falls.

2653
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:05,020
We gotta go to sleep.

2654
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:10,420
It hit the armor.

2655
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:11,840
That's why I didn't get it.

2656
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:13,900
Yeah, armor!

2657
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:20,420
Hitchhiker!

2658
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:22,880
Hitchhiker, please!

2659
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:24,880
Please, hitchhiker!

2660
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:26,860
Introspection.

2661
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:29,000
Wow, those clouds are incredible!

2662
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,440
Looks like some massive Olympian castle.

2663
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:33,420
I gotta stop.

2664
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,740
It's strange that I still get moved by something.

2665
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:36,040
What?

2666
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:37,820
No, it's not strange at all.

2667
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:42,080
You decide to stop the car and just watch the clouds go by.

2668
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:44,640
We're inspired!

2669
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,560
Oh, what am I doing?

2670
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:49,560
I'm stopping and... Oh, low gas!

2671
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:53,920
It's okay, we got gas.

2672
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:55,500
We got gas, we're okay.

2673
02:22:57,980 --> 02:22:58,720
What clouds?

2674
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:01,920
It's like a completely beautiful night.

2675
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:02,540
It's clear.

2676
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:14,780
Weekends!

2677
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:22,040
Man, I don't... I like... I actually really like road trips.

2678
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,320
I like road trips so much.

2679
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:26,200
Majestic falcon again.

2680
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:32,300
I like... You know, the journey is part of the fun, no?

2681
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:35,220
I think at least.

2682
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,940
Oh, that works.

2683
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:45,380
I'm gonna use my...

2684
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,610
It doesn't quite work, but it's fine.

2685
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:52,950
Ouch.

2686
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:53,390
Ouch.

2687
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:03,460
We can just use this twice.

2688
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:10,880
Can't wait to take Minky Plush on road trips with me.

2689
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:13,540
I don't know the last time I've done a road trip though.

2690
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:17,760
Well, my car is not doing so hot, so...

2691
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,240
It's not fair.

2692
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:23,800
I've never once won at a carnival or lottery or anything.

2693
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:27,740
Gas prices went up as soon as I decided to get a car.

2694
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,940
When I need a mechanic, there's none.

2695
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,500
And when I don't, they're everywhere.

2696
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:34,260
The first one is me.

2697
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:39,560
I wonder if most people feel that way.

2698
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,600
I got one money!

2699
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:46,560
I got a pity buck.

2700
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:47,360
Let's go.

2701
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:56,230
Then car.

2702
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:58,230
Maybe there's a cat in there.

2703
02:25:00,890 --> 02:25:03,110
Give debuff to three random threats.

2704
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:03,750
Why?

2705
02:25:05,410 --> 02:25:07,070
Why do you do that?

2706
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:20,520
We're inspired.

2707
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:23,740
We're inspired.

2708
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,140
It's okay, we can make this easy.

2709
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:28,660
New trait.

2710
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:29,080
Wait.

2711
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:29,860
Oh, experience.

2712
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:33,740
Have a go now has five maximum uses.

2713
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:36,280
A heater!

2714
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:38,640
Scrap.

2715
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:40,900
Okay, let's see.

2716
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:41,860
How do we wanna...

2717
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,620
Heater seems pretty big.

2718
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,780
I have a lot of berries.

2719
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:01,930
Maybe I don't need so many berries.

2720
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:03,090
Right?

2721
02:26:04,170 --> 02:26:05,070
Oh, fold the seeds.

2722
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:07,830
I need my berries.

2723
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:17,950
We haven't come across a single person, so why not, right?

2724
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:21,750
We can just eat a bunch of berries.

2725
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:24,070
Your thumbnail is too cute.

2726
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:25,250
I got you whacked enough.

2727
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:28,070
You guys like sundresses that much?

2728
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:29,430
Wait, what's happening?

2729
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:30,270
Oh, we're here.

2730
02:26:31,130 --> 02:26:32,330
New skill tree, driving.

2731
02:26:33,350 --> 02:26:33,890
Let's go.

2732
02:26:36,290 --> 02:26:37,670
Basic targeting skill.

2733
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:38,950
Cost one gas.

2734
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:39,430
No.

2735
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:43,130
Cost one energy.

2736
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:43,430
Wait.

2737
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:46,250
If you get it perfect with this skill, gain one gas.

2738
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:49,550
The skill trees, you guys.

2739
02:26:49,890 --> 02:26:51,290
I'm stupid with these.

2740
02:26:51,350 --> 02:26:52,430
I don't understand them at all.

2741
02:26:53,570 --> 02:26:55,270
I don't understand them at all.

2742
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:58,130
Wisps being unwise.

2743
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:00,730
That's okay.

2744
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:02,530
Oh, hello.

2745
02:27:04,650 --> 02:27:06,050
Nice ride, kid.

2746
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:09,230
Heard about the great race down at the Pine Raceway?

2747
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:10,590
You should check it out.

2748
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:15,950
New journey.

2749
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:17,290
The great race.

2750
02:27:18,570 --> 02:27:21,610
Warm welcome to the annual weekend long driving competition at Pine Raceway.

2751
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:22,670
We would never win this.

2752
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:24,310
Install a roll cage.

2753
02:27:24,410 --> 02:27:25,010
Get to the race.

2754
02:27:25,130 --> 02:27:25,730
Enter the race.

2755
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:28,130
Big first place prize?

2756
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:31,350
I can't not accept it, so...

2757
02:27:31,350 --> 02:27:32,550
Okay.

2758
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:34,550
Oh, we're kind of close.

2759
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:36,430
Actually.

2760
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:38,550
Okay.

2761
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:40,570
Interesting.

2762
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:46,130
Alright, first things, we're going to sleep.

2763
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:47,970
Stay until morning.

2764
02:27:48,350 --> 02:27:49,850
It's so expensive.

2765
02:27:51,090 --> 02:27:52,530
But we'll get a nice sleep, right?

2766
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:55,990
It will cure us of all our ailments, probably.

2767
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:03,910
Everything is... Wow.

2768
02:28:04,550 --> 02:28:07,050
We're happy and we are satisfied.

2769
02:28:08,070 --> 02:28:11,190
There is countless memes and posts about guys going feral for sundresses.

2770
02:28:11,310 --> 02:28:11,650
Seriously?

2771
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:12,890
I never knew that.

2772
02:28:16,210 --> 02:28:18,050
Why is there no grocery store here?

2773
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,120
Hey mister, you need some berries?

2774
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:27,180
Customize.

2775
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:31,680
Oh no!

2776
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:37,640
We can either get two max durability or we can get the heater.

2777
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,360
We can't have both.

2778
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:43,900
What do you guys think?

2779
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:47,120
Sundresses are cute?

2780
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:49,240
I see.

2781
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,060
I see.

2782
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:54,120
I learned something today.

2783
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,960
A sundress killed my father.

2784
02:28:59,380 --> 02:29:00,440
Isn't it summer?

2785
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:02,020
But we were cold earlier, no?

2786
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:05,380
We had the cold...

2787
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:11,600
We got cold earlier.

2788
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:17,040
Why are these woods so terrifying?

2789
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,600
Wait.

2790
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,420
Ok, just kidding.

2791
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:30,550
Hopefully it's not just mushrooms.

2792
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:32,930
Hopefully there is also a cat in there.

2793
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:40,330
I had a road trip a while back with a few friends to pick up a puppy in New York.

2794
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:41,690
We sang the musical for Hamilton.

2795
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:43,290
All the way there and back.

2796
02:29:43,330 --> 02:29:44,170
Great times.

2797
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:51,370
I still haven't seen Hamilton.

2798
02:29:52,990 --> 02:29:56,070
Hamilton, Hamilton, Hamilton, Hamilton.

2799
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:57,730
My name is Hamilton.

2800
02:29:58,390 --> 02:30:01,870
Mom, I really am a 10.

2801
02:30:04,030 --> 02:30:07,950
Everybody knows about this ham I spin.

2802
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:10,490
Hamilton, Hamilton.

2803
02:30:12,570 --> 02:30:13,930
Big trees here.

2804
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:21,370
Oh gosh, scared me.

2805
02:30:25,170 --> 02:30:26,910
Maybe I got everything in here.

2806
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,060
Watch along?

2807
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:33,540
Where can you watch it?

2808
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:37,920
You guys think I got everything in here?

2809
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:40,740
I feel like I didn't miss anything.

2810
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:43,320
The car is down behind me.

2811
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:46,020
It wasn't very big in here, I think.

2812
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:49,800
Oh wait, a second cave?

2813
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:51,460
Just kidding, I did not get everything.

2814
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:53,220
I'm a liar.

2815
02:30:55,780 --> 02:30:58,580
I actually don't know where I'm going at all.

2816
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,640
There we go.

2817
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:06,340
Okay.

2818
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,400
More scrap to sell.

2819
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:21,140
We can sell this immediately.

2820
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,280
What do we do with the mushroom?

2821
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:28,160
These are different kind of mushroom we don't have yet.

2822
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:35,700
There we go.

2823
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:38,080
A fender and a radiator.

2824
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:40,300
Negates the hot status.

2825
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:40,400
Yes.

2826
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:43,840
Okay.

2827
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:47,220
We're good.

2828
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:49,440
I guess you could sell the mushroom.

2829
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:49,840
Yes.

2830
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:52,400
That's fine.

2831
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:54,220
I guess we could.

2832
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,720
So let's see, what do we do with these guys?

2833
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:00,200
This is a utility.

2834
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:02,840
Okay, negates the hot status, increases durability.

2835
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:04,580
That's big.

2836
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:06,020
We need more durability.

2837
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,020
More health, please.

2838
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:11,800
Hmm...

2839
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:17,800
We don't have anything for the roof yet.

2840
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:20,200
Or the engine.

2841
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:26,430
Okay.

2842
02:32:28,510 --> 02:32:30,350
Oh wait, I was going to sell the scrap.

2843
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:36,550
Sell scrap, sell scrap, sell scrap, sell scrap.

2844
02:32:37,810 --> 02:32:38,290
Cool.

2845
02:32:39,130 --> 02:32:40,330
Saltyfish, welcome to membership.

2846
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:40,970
Thank you.

2847
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:43,410
Yeah, we'll save the radiator for now.

2848
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:45,590
I mean, I have the heater also.

2849
02:32:46,750 --> 02:32:50,530
So we have one for heat and one for cold.

2850
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:52,650
Honestly, we're so good.

2851
02:32:57,140 --> 02:32:59,380
We have hot and cold.

2852
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:03,620
So you're hot, then you're cold.

2853
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,340
You're yes, then you're no.

2854
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,220
You're in, then you're out.

2855
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:09,040
Up, then you're down.

2856
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:10,840
Where are we going from here?

2857
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:18,640
We're good on money, which is kind of crazy.

2858
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:22,040
We're actually so good on money.

2859
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:23,540
What place has a thrift store?

2860
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:26,940
Nowhere around here.

2861
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,280
We can keep exploring.

2862
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,240
We can go to Lawnery.

2863
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:39,900
Nochi, thank you so much for the five gifts.

2864
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:40,900
Thank you.

2865
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:43,320
There was one more scrap there, what?

2866
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:45,260
Did I miss it?

2867
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:49,760
Oh, I missed this one.

2868
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:50,300
Thank you.

2869
02:33:51,860 --> 02:33:55,020
I also realized I have two aspirins.

2870
02:33:56,680 --> 02:33:59,360
I could probably sell the trumpet too, but...

2871
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:00,660
Whatever.

2872
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:04,020
Hot and cold, Minky.

2873
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,040
Loner Larry.

2874
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:11,840
Lawnery.

2875
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,000
Lawnery.

2876
02:34:12,380 --> 02:34:12,900
Let's go.

2877
02:34:17,130 --> 02:34:18,990
Oh, I just realized our toons.

2878
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,540
Shuffle baby, shuffle.

2879
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:28,620
Oh, my mouse just died.

2880
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:29,760
Hold on.

2881
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:31,280
I got to plug it in.

2882
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:34,700
I can't press play.

2883
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:47,440
It was blinking.

2884
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:49,480
It was yelling at me like, hey plug me in.

2885
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:57,800
Okay.

2886
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:58,640
Yes.

2887
02:34:58,780 --> 02:34:59,220
Okay, we're good.

2888
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:03,420
Low gas!

2889
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:15,930
We're all good.

2890
02:35:16,730 --> 02:35:18,050
Everything's fine.

2891
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:21,530
Crystal boys.

2892
02:35:23,070 --> 02:35:23,910
Roadkill.

2893
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:25,750
When are we going to get a dang hitchhiker?

2894
02:35:27,530 --> 02:35:29,230
Game hates me.

2895
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:30,090
What is this?

2896
02:35:31,070 --> 02:35:32,030
Nothing happened.

2897
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:32,570
Okay.

2898
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:41,600
Uh...

2899
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:48,680
Okay.

2900
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,520
Oh, I think my chat died.

2901
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:54,040
Give me one second, you guys.

2902
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:56,980
I will bring you back to life.

2903
02:35:58,060 --> 02:35:58,680
One second.

2904
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:01,860
YouTube bros.

2905
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:06,300
You're dead.

2906
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:07,360
Just like me.

2907
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:08,940
Oh,

2908
02:36:12,460 --> 02:36:12,680
my gosh.

2909
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:13,880
I just realized the time too.

2910
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:16,140
No, but I want to keep playing.

2911
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:21,880
I haven't made my zort fighting room.

2912
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:24,320
Wait!

2913
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:26,480
No!

2914
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,780
Did I forget saying bye to my best friend turning off the oven?

2915
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,440
No, no.

2916
02:36:32,100 --> 02:36:33,160
I'll say the best friend.

2917
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,440
No, we said bye a few days ago.

2918
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:39,720
Oh, we're so sure.

2919
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,560
Hitchhikers level faster.

2920
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:42,820
If I had any.

2921
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:46,980
Do it on stream?

2922
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:47,340
Okay.

2923
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:53,320
Something on the roadside.

2924
02:36:54,480 --> 02:36:57,540
Gonna miss the collab tonight, so this is my last Minto stream before your break.

2925
02:36:57,700 --> 02:36:58,480
Have lots of fun in Japan.

2926
02:36:58,820 --> 02:36:59,460
Thanks, Nashi!

2927
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:01,560
Thank you, thank you.

2928
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:06,160
Whatever this is, is dangerous.

2929
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:10,240
Watch this god play.

2930
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,520
I messed up.

2931
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:12,180
Nevermind.

2932
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,780
Did you think there was a person in there?

2933
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:46,580
Oh, my god!

2934
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:48,320
We found the cat!

2935
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:53,600
Oh, my god!

2936
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:56,460
We found the cat.

2937
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,490
Let's go!

2938
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:08,310
Turn this car around!

2939
02:38:09,810 --> 02:38:11,970
Turn this car around!

2940
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:15,030
Hot holes.

2941
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:20,650
Schrodinger's cat reel.

2942
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:24,570
Turn this car around!

2943
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:25,990
Oh, my goodness.

2944
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:28,210
It's trying to kill me.

2945
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:46,260
It's threatening.

2946
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:48,240
It's threatening me.

2947
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:51,780
Wait, is this a... Okay, I have one last thing.

2948
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,520
So next time we'll have to sleep.

2949
02:38:54,300 --> 02:38:56,520
We'll have to...

2950
02:38:58,580 --> 02:39:00,280
Name the cat?

2951
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:01,300
It's not ours.

2952
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:02,660
We're gonna go return him.

2953
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:06,260
I'll name him Minto Jr. No.

2954
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:08,520
I'll name him...

2955
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:12,740
Thunder Breaker.

2956
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,440
Unlucky.

2957
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:25,580
Wait, what's happening?

2958
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:26,920
Is it just wind?

2959
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:29,380
Oh, insect swarm?

2960
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:31,320
Okay.

2961
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:31,540
Okay.

2962
02:39:35,410 --> 02:39:36,090
Oh, no!

2963
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,600
This is not good.

2964
02:39:44,220 --> 02:39:44,700
Ouch!

2965
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:46,480
Oh, ouch!

2966
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:48,140
Oh, ouch!

2967
02:39:49,060 --> 02:39:49,540
Ouch!

2968
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,680
Am I in the zone?

2969
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:57,500
Oh, escape.

2970
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:58,580
Yeah, I think we could...

2971
02:39:58,580 --> 02:40:00,160
Oh, I forgot that that's an option.

2972
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:02,300
Which one is it again?

2973
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:05,120
Oh, wait.

2974
02:40:05,380 --> 02:40:05,980
Not that.

2975
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:06,700
It's this one, right?

2976
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:13,580
We tanked it.

2977
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:16,000
I see.

2978
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:19,580
Use during events to escape or skip the...

2979
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,140
Yeah,

2980
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:25,500
that hurt though.

2981
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:26,520
That hurt pretty bad.

2982
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:31,970
Welcome to Lonery, everybody.

2983
02:40:33,650 --> 02:40:34,990
Let's see what we got here.

2984
02:40:36,550 --> 02:40:37,750
My favorite band.

2985
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:38,610
Oh, the band.

2986
02:40:38,610 --> 02:40:41,390
No, I gotta go return the cat.

2987
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:43,790
I don't need food.

2988
02:40:44,990 --> 02:40:46,970
I can sell the cat!

2989
02:40:47,650 --> 02:40:49,690
He gives me 2k.

2990
02:40:51,730 --> 02:40:53,050
That's so sad.

2991
02:40:54,530 --> 02:40:56,150
We are hungry, right?

2992
02:40:56,810 --> 02:40:57,450
Oh, we're just tired.

2993
02:40:57,530 --> 02:40:58,410
Yeah, but we are hungry.

2994
02:40:58,990 --> 02:41:00,950
Which we have plenty of.

2995
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:03,610
Oh yeah, we're good now.

2996
02:41:03,970 --> 02:41:05,130
But we're also tired.

2997
02:41:05,310 --> 02:41:06,430
So let's rest here.

2998
02:41:13,630 --> 02:41:16,190
I was really hoping this would be your kind of game.

2999
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:17,950
I'd love a weekend road trip again in the future.

3000
02:41:18,130 --> 02:41:19,390
Yeah, I mean...

3001
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:21,430
We're definitely probably not gonna get to the...

3002
02:41:22,110 --> 02:41:22,930
Festival today.

3003
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:24,650
But we have to get to the festival.

3004
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:26,070
No.

3005
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:29,650
We have to get to the festival.

3006
02:41:32,590 --> 02:41:34,410
I'm gonna get this multispray.

3007
02:41:38,050 --> 02:41:39,630
Since I have nothing for blue.

3008
02:41:40,290 --> 02:41:40,890
At the moment.

3009
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:42,910
Alright.

3010
02:41:44,030 --> 02:41:46,230
Turn this car around!

3011
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:49,890
We gotta go to...

3012
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:54,680
Far.

3013
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:55,840
Fardorf.

3014
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:57,100
It is truly far.

3015
02:41:58,100 --> 02:41:59,060
Oh gosh.

3016
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:03,840
How about we go...

3017
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,140
Here.

3018
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:08,160
And here here.

3019
02:42:09,240 --> 02:42:10,360
Might be our best bet.

3020
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:16,740
Far far away.

3021
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:20,260
And then once I...

3022
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:25,540
Once I deliver the cat...

3023
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:26,680
We'll call it there.

3024
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:32,660
What

3025
02:42:36,910 --> 02:42:37,950
am I doing?

3026
02:42:38,110 --> 02:42:39,570
Shouldn't I be looking for a job or something?

3027
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:40,410
No!

3028
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:42,350
It's the time for adventure!

3029
02:42:44,030 --> 02:42:45,110
Kind of helps.

3030
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:53,360
The cat is like jamming in the backseat.

3031
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:13,530
Oh my gosh, my car though.

3032
02:43:15,410 --> 02:43:17,030
We've taken a lot of damage.

3033
02:43:18,910 --> 02:43:19,950
Oh my gosh!

3034
02:43:20,070 --> 02:43:21,010
Our first hitchhiker!

3035
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:23,410
In the middle of the night.

3036
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:24,490
Who are you?

3037
02:43:25,790 --> 02:43:27,730
Good thing you came along.

3038
02:43:28,170 --> 02:43:29,790
I was thinking I was gonna miss the show.

3039
02:43:30,410 --> 02:43:32,950
I'm headed to the big effing apple.

3040
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:35,150
Hey, do you have some food with you?

3041
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:36,350
I think she's hungry.

3042
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:38,630
Who is she?

3043
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,640
He has a dog?

3044
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:49,200
This kid was just standing on the side of the road with his dog.

3045
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:51,040
A pure breed boarzoi!

3046
02:43:51,780 --> 02:43:53,540
I couldn't even tell he was looking for a ride.

3047
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,880
It doesn't pay to try.

3048
02:43:54,980 --> 02:43:56,320
It was written on one of his pins.

3049
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:58,880
He looked a bit like a junkie.

3050
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:01,300
Needs extra space in the car.

3051
02:44:01,400 --> 02:44:02,380
Uh oh, are they gonna fight?

3052
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:09,150
That's our first hitchhiker though.

3053
02:44:09,890 --> 02:44:11,510
You will need extra space for the dog.

3054
02:44:11,770 --> 02:44:12,990
Yes, I do have space.

3055
02:44:13,350 --> 02:44:14,390
How big is this dog?

3056
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:20,340
How big is this dog?

3057
02:44:30,390 --> 02:44:31,610
He needs a seat.

3058
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:37,990
Oh my god!

3059
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:46,530
I guess we'll try hanging out with him.

3060
02:44:46,530 --> 02:44:47,370
I guess.

3061
02:44:50,590 --> 02:44:51,590
Oh, the punk.

3062
02:44:51,690 --> 02:44:53,650
Oh my god, the dog is in the backseat.

3063
02:44:55,850 --> 02:44:57,830
No one would pick me up with my dog.

3064
02:44:57,970 --> 02:44:58,950
Appreciate it.

3065
02:45:05,430 --> 02:45:07,730
Oh my god, another hitchhiker.

3066
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:09,210
Wait, hitchhiker argument?

3067
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:10,390
What are you talking about?

3068
02:45:10,430 --> 02:45:11,070
We have one.

3069
02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:15,130
What are you talking about?

3070
02:45:15,730 --> 02:45:16,530
Who is he arguing?

3071
02:45:16,670 --> 02:45:18,130
Oh, are we arguing with him?

3072
02:45:18,130 --> 02:45:20,270
Oh my god.

3073
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:25,510
Stop it!

3074
02:45:26,730 --> 02:45:27,690
With the dog.

3075
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:34,260
You finished advertised.

3076
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:35,980
Oh nice, we got a lot of money there.

3077
02:45:39,220 --> 02:45:40,720
I'm currently tired.

3078
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:45,900
Can we go exploring at night?

3079
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:48,600
I should be really discouraged, no?

3080
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:51,560
Let's try it, let's try it.

3081
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:56,890
Oh, I don't like that.

3082
02:45:59,190 --> 02:46:05,370
This should be highly... I feel like I'm about to be chased after by a serial killer or something.

3083
02:46:07,090 --> 02:46:08,430
Oh my god, it's scary.

3084
02:46:13,690 --> 02:46:15,370
This is so scary!

3085
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:22,400
Minus one.

3086
02:46:26,850 --> 02:46:28,530
I think I just went in a circle.

3087
02:46:30,670 --> 02:46:31,870
And this...

3088
02:46:33,930 --> 02:46:35,550
Big rock is blocking.

3089
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:36,690
Oh, not

3090
02:46:41,710 --> 02:46:43,330
yet.

3091
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:48,070
What was that sound?

3092
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:51,790
I'm gonna get eaten here, aren't I?

3093
02:46:55,590 --> 02:46:56,190
Vines.

3094
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:02,690
I'm not lost.

3095
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:05,490
I'm just trying to find other places.

3096
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:10,200
I'm not lost.

3097
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:12,740
Minus one.

3098
02:47:17,220 --> 02:47:18,960
There's not much in here, honestly.

3099
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:20,560
Let's just leave.

3100
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:25,540
We're losing a lot of energy actually, being in here.

3101
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:25,880
Why?

3102
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:26,000
Okay.

3103
02:47:28,460 --> 02:47:29,920
We got some matches.

3104
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,840
Might not always work.

3105
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:36,080
And cigarettes.

3106
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:37,800
And trash.

3107
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:39,420
Let's sell that.

3108
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:44,340
More cigarettes.

3109
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:50,100
Ours is pretty full right now, so we'll put the matches, I suppose, and hope that they work.

3110
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:54,040
And enter.

3111
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:55,620
And sleep.

3112
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:01,360
What is the hitchhiker's... Where does he sleep with his dog?

3113
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,740
I'm not paying for him too, right?

3114
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:05,520
Yeah!

3115
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,180
Alright!

3116
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:08,340
Where to?

3117
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:09,200
Where to?

3118
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:10,900
Road map.

3119
02:48:11,620 --> 02:48:14,500
We said we were going to go to...

3120
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:17,020
Oh, I just noticed there's...

3121
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:19,660
We should be fine.

3122
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:22,520
Gosh, we have a long drive, don't we?

3123
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:22,620
Yeah.

3124
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:28,400
It would have been the same even if we went this way, though.

3125
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:29,980
So it's okay.

3126
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:34,100
My gas.

3127
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:41,420
We'll use it.

3128
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:44,560
The gas, we're okay.

3129
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:46,620
We still have another full can.

3130
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:49,040
And I think we can...

3131
02:48:50,440 --> 02:48:50,880
Probably...

3132
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:53,440
We can probably fill those up, even.

3133
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:56,040
Can you sell the hitchhiker and their dog?

3134
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:57,680
I wish.

3135
02:48:58,300 --> 02:49:02,320
I knew some guys that played in a band that sounded a bit like this.

3136
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:03,640
Oh, I believe it.

3137
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:06,240
Their biggest gig was to their moms.

3138
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:13,820
We're gonna get this cat home safe and sound!

3139
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:16,740
Trust.

3140
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:25,320
I should think of something to think.

3141
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:27,380
Do not think.

3142
02:49:29,020 --> 02:49:30,840
Not as easy as I thought.

3143
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:39,860
Oh, it's raining!

3144
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:45,520
Thunderstorm!

3145
02:49:46,040 --> 02:49:48,760
Head empty.

3146
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:53,600
Give shields the one random threat.

3147
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:54,400
Shield?

3148
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:58,040
Look at the dog!

3149
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:01,160
He doesn't do anything!

3150
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:04,040
Removes three random threats.

3151
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:04,840
Do it.

3152
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,860
Even with the shield!

3153
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:10,140
Damn, that's actually pretty good, not gonna lie.

3154
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:18,740
Boarzoi.

3155
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:21,540
He's a good guy.

3156
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:22,440
He's a good boy.

3157
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:25,240
Oh, I should have used the...

3158
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,960
Dang it, I didn't think about it.

3159
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,300
It's okay.

3160
02:50:32,130 --> 02:50:32,970
Happy turn!

3161
02:50:33,150 --> 02:50:33,430
Happy!

3162
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:36,150
Use crafty items.

3163
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:36,790
New trait.

3164
02:50:40,770 --> 02:50:43,670
Wait, did I not use that?

3165
02:50:48,850 --> 02:50:51,070
Didn't I do it for you?

3166
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:01,530
Fallen tree!

3167
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:09,410
Rough terrain.

3168
02:51:13,180 --> 02:51:14,380
Let's use it on this.

3169
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:17,500
What does the shield do though?

3170
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:22,040
Let me try it.

3171
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:23,900
Oh, I see.

3172
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:24,840
You gotta get it twice.

3173
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:25,440
Okay, okay.

3174
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:28,140
I learned.

3175
02:51:32,050 --> 02:51:33,650
Add one durability threat.

3176
02:51:34,390 --> 02:51:34,630
No!

3177
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:39,590
How many times has Minto been pulled over?

3178
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:41,490
Zero?

3179
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:49,540
The forest is inspiring.

3180
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:51,020
We're still happy.

3181
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:52,820
Oh my gosh.

3182
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:59,680
I still have three out of four.

3183
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:00,300
We can use it.

3184
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:02,560
Yay!

3185
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:08,620
I only got pulled over that one time!

3186
02:52:09,360 --> 02:52:12,020
The forest line looks like a bunch of teeth.

3187
02:52:16,270 --> 02:52:17,050
Minus half.

3188
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:18,090
We're not happy anymore.

3189
02:52:19,350 --> 02:52:21,950
We have to spend our days with this bozo.

3190
02:52:22,390 --> 02:52:24,030
The dog is cute at least.

3191
02:52:24,930 --> 02:52:26,110
At least the dog is good.

3192
02:52:29,310 --> 02:52:31,190
Can I not fill up the jerry cans?

3193
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:40,530
36 dollars even.

3194
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:42,590
Let's do like 15.

3195
02:52:44,190 --> 02:52:47,780
Dang it.

3196
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:48,740
Good enough.

3197
02:52:51,270 --> 02:52:53,170
I thought so, but I think I was wrong.

3198
02:52:53,250 --> 02:52:54,210
Someone said you can't.

3199
02:52:54,230 --> 02:52:55,070
Oh no!

3200
02:52:56,130 --> 02:52:59,210
A poor cat will be returned half deaf from blasting music.

3201
02:53:00,810 --> 02:53:02,370
Don't say that!

3202
02:53:03,390 --> 02:53:03,910
Who are you?

3203
02:53:05,090 --> 02:53:05,590
Hey!

3204
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:07,030
Good seeing ya.

3205
02:53:07,410 --> 02:53:10,890
I drove past a really freaking crazy party up in the hills.

3206
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:11,890
So weird.

3207
02:53:12,090 --> 02:53:14,450
It was dead quiet, then all of a sudden...

3208
02:53:14,450 --> 02:53:14,850
Bam!

3209
02:53:15,310 --> 02:53:15,810
Party!

3210
02:53:16,370 --> 02:53:18,410
Why is my thing like kind of weird?

3211
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:22,990
Naked dude climbing a tree and some girls doing coke in an outdoor jacuzzi.

3212
02:53:25,410 --> 02:53:26,590
Fun stuff.

3213
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:33,410
If we tried for the rehab route...

3214
02:53:34,710 --> 02:53:36,130
Oh my gosh.

3215
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:40,030
It's craziness out there everybody.

3216
02:53:43,630 --> 02:53:45,790
The dog is staring at me.

3217
02:53:45,890 --> 02:53:46,850
It's freaking me out.

3218
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:49,950
It's freaking me out.

3219
02:53:57,740 --> 02:54:00,060
I don't think I need anything honestly.

3220
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:02,980
I guess, what, do I have to sell the jerry cans?

3221
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:06,460
But they don't give me any money.

3222
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:09,920
A can gives me more money than the empty jerry can.

3223
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,200
Sell the berries?

3224
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:14,780
I have a lot of money.

3225
02:54:15,320 --> 02:54:15,700
I don't need that.

3226
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:16,680
They are only 50 cents.

3227
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:19,440
I guess we'll keep going.

3228
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:21,680
Or rather...

3229
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:24,840
37 dollars.

3230
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:30,440
No,

3231
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:46,460
it doesn't let you refill.

3232
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:50,580
So honestly, just getting rid of them is the best case.

3233
02:54:51,980 --> 02:54:53,040
What the trumpet do.

3234
02:54:53,300 --> 02:54:55,060
It's very nice and clean.

3235
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:56,320
And...

3236
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:59,300
Alright, let's get to the cat.

3237
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:02,320
We're almost there.

3238
02:55:03,560 --> 02:55:06,060
Sorry, I'm looking around because I'm like...

3239
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:09,900
There's another... Wait.

3240
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:12,060
Oh my gosh, I totally...

3241
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:14,040
We went the long way.

3242
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:16,780
Dang it, I didn't realize there was a second place.

3243
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:20,540
Can I just skip it?

3244
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:21,180
Oh well.

3245
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:21,840
Okay, let's go.

3246
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:23,040
Come on!

3247
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:27,380
I misread the map entirely.

3248
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:29,900
We went the nice way.

3249
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:33,700
Sell the dog.

3250
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:36,940
What year is this game taking place in?

3251
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,080
It says early 2000s.

3252
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:44,340
Behind large truck.

3253
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:46,900
I hate that.

3254
02:55:49,580 --> 02:55:52,260
Alright, give shield to one random threat.

3255
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:52,920
Okay.

3256
02:55:54,480 --> 02:55:55,660
Alright, watch this.

3257
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:01,620
And then...

3258
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:03,840
Ouch,

3259
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:09,140
threat please.

3260
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:12,420
We are so close to this truck.

3261
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:14,580
We have a death wish.

3262
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:18,860
Damn it, why did I do that?

3263
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:20,800
Oh, I have an extra turn.

3264
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:24,880
I think I just ran out of these.

3265
02:56:28,630 --> 02:56:30,090
No, I'm stressed.

3266
02:56:30,210 --> 02:56:31,390
I am stressed!

3267
02:56:31,910 --> 02:56:34,570
Yeah, maybe stop following behind so hard.

3268
02:56:37,210 --> 02:56:38,530
I'm stressed!

3269
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:40,490
Nice.

3270
02:56:41,090 --> 02:56:42,270
Wait, did it work?

3271
02:56:44,190 --> 02:56:45,630
I don't think it did.

3272
02:56:48,090 --> 02:56:48,730
This game.

3273
02:56:56,120 --> 02:56:56,880
This game.

3274
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:59,060
More attacks this turn.

3275
02:57:01,320 --> 02:57:03,060
Okay, we just gotta get rid of them.

3276
02:57:05,820 --> 02:57:06,260
Perfect.

3277
02:57:07,540 --> 02:57:08,520
Yeah, we got rid of stress.

3278
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:17,180
Let's try using the matches again.

3279
02:57:17,380 --> 02:57:17,960
Matches please.

3280
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:21,580
Why doesn't it work?

3281
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:26,380
That's the third time I've used these stinking matches and they don't work every time.

3282
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:34,060
Guys, we are gonna run out of...

3283
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:38,420
Step on it!

3284
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:40,800
I have to.

3285
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:41,700
I had to.

3286
02:57:42,580 --> 02:57:43,640
I had to.

3287
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:50,440
Yikes.

3288
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:54,540
Come on.

3289
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:57,360
I'm gonna kick this guy out of my car.

3290
02:57:57,360 --> 02:58:00,100
I've never had a hitchhiker argument before.

3291
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:02,240
Excuse me.

3292
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:04,400
Why are we fighting?

3293
02:58:13,650 --> 02:58:14,450
Next turn.

3294
02:58:16,370 --> 02:58:16,770
Raiders.

3295
02:58:16,930 --> 02:58:17,910
Oh, thank you for the raid.

3296
02:58:17,970 --> 02:58:19,070
Sorry, I didn't see who raided me.

3297
02:58:19,410 --> 02:58:20,330
Thank you!

3298
02:58:21,750 --> 02:58:23,590
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

3299
02:58:24,070 --> 02:58:25,130
Murphy, thanks for the gifted.

3300
02:58:29,130 --> 02:58:30,730
We don't have vibes right now.

3301
02:58:30,810 --> 02:58:31,770
We have only stress.

3302
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:33,610
Thanks for the five gifted!

3303
02:58:35,310 --> 02:58:35,930
Thank you!

3304
02:58:37,990 --> 02:58:39,470
Please, take me home.

3305
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:42,470
Oh gosh, why is this road so long?

3306
02:58:43,530 --> 02:58:44,110
Ok, phew.

3307
02:58:44,250 --> 02:58:45,090
It's just introspection.

3308
02:58:45,490 --> 02:58:46,890
That driver must be like 14.

3309
02:58:47,010 --> 02:58:48,290
No way he could have a license.

3310
02:58:49,230 --> 02:58:51,810
I'm so happy I don't have pimples like that anymore.

3311
02:58:52,490 --> 02:58:55,390
Feel your face, touch your brow and the crease of your nostril.

3312
02:58:57,390 --> 02:58:57,850
What?

3313
02:58:59,110 --> 02:59:00,170
What does that mean?

3314
02:59:00,170 --> 02:59:02,470
Why are we feeling our face?

3315
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:04,990
Can't tell if I'm greasy or just sweaty.

3316
02:59:07,670 --> 02:59:08,870
We're hot.

3317
02:59:10,210 --> 02:59:11,410
And we're hungry.

3318
02:59:11,890 --> 02:59:12,210
It's ok.

3319
02:59:12,770 --> 02:59:13,790
We can fix it.

3320
02:59:14,410 --> 02:59:15,090
Hungry?

3321
02:59:15,290 --> 02:59:16,210
No problem.

3322
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:19,270
Minus hunger.

3323
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:27,210
And we can negate the hot status if this place has a... It does not.

3324
02:59:27,730 --> 02:59:28,190
Awesome.

3325
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:31,970
Beep boop.

3326
02:59:38,130 --> 02:59:40,510
I wanna sell the matches cause they suck.

3327
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:41,090
You know what?

3328
02:59:41,130 --> 02:59:41,530
I am.

3329
02:59:41,950 --> 02:59:42,770
Screw the matches.

3330
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:44,270
Don't like them.

3331
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:46,150
They have never helped me.

3332
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:48,730
Let's do...

3333
02:59:49,990 --> 02:59:51,890
There's no gas ones in here.

3334
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:54,870
Let's do...

3335
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:57,830
Let's do the duct tape.

3336
02:59:58,270 --> 02:59:59,030
Let's buy the duct tape.

3337
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:02,830
Mao Mao, thank you so much for the time gifted.

3338
03:00:03,410 --> 03:00:04,410
Hope you like berries.

3339
03:00:06,330 --> 03:00:08,870
What's the point of buying food if all you need is berries?

3340
03:00:09,430 --> 03:00:12,890
If you can just get berries from the wild, why would you buy anything else?

3341
03:00:13,270 --> 03:00:14,330
Why would you buy chips?

3342
03:00:14,810 --> 03:00:15,650
Why would you buy anything?

3343
03:00:16,250 --> 03:00:16,650
Why?

3344
03:00:18,170 --> 03:00:18,970
Let's rest.

3345
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:22,910
We gotta get this cat home.

3346
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:25,950
We're not hot anymore.

3347
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:28,630
My car.

3348
03:00:30,030 --> 03:00:32,390
You can repair durability at garages.

3349
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:34,290
Maybe there's a garage in the next place.

3350
03:00:38,050 --> 03:00:39,010
Oh, there is!

3351
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:39,730
Okay, nice.

3352
03:00:41,330 --> 03:00:41,990
We'll repair.

3353
03:00:43,190 --> 03:00:44,470
But first, we must get there.

3354
03:00:47,350 --> 03:00:48,610
Berries tend to go bad.

3355
03:00:48,690 --> 03:00:50,210
Not in this game, I guess.

3356
03:00:52,650 --> 03:00:53,090
Especially...

3357
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:55,090
Just, you know, they're just out in my car.

3358
03:00:55,330 --> 03:00:56,170
They're totally fine.

3359
03:00:59,130 --> 03:01:00,670
Muddy road.

3360
03:01:01,310 --> 03:01:02,690
Oh, I forgot about CDs.

3361
03:01:03,190 --> 03:01:04,990
Sorry guys, I completely forgot about our music.

3362
03:01:07,090 --> 03:01:09,630
Okay, we've got this.

3363
03:01:10,910 --> 03:01:12,450
Let's use this can.

3364
03:01:13,710 --> 03:01:15,070
My can, please.

3365
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:16,230
Can.

3366
03:01:17,630 --> 03:01:18,470
Nice.

3367
03:01:21,830 --> 03:01:23,510
And you.

3368
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:24,710
Perfect.

3369
03:01:26,670 --> 03:01:29,430
I can't believe that gives us damage.

3370
03:01:31,050 --> 03:01:32,670
The forest is inspiring.

3371
03:01:34,910 --> 03:01:36,610
You, and then one more.

3372
03:01:38,710 --> 03:01:39,030
Thank you.

3373
03:01:39,110 --> 03:01:40,450
A hitchhiker also has abilities.

3374
03:01:41,370 --> 03:01:42,070
That's right.

3375
03:01:42,270 --> 03:01:42,950
I keep forgetting.

3376
03:01:45,230 --> 03:01:47,930
Besides his little skill that he gives me.

3377
03:01:49,550 --> 03:01:50,630
We're getting dirty.

3378
03:01:50,730 --> 03:01:52,850
Our car is getting pretty muddy.

3379
03:01:54,130 --> 03:01:54,650
Nasty.

3380
03:01:56,670 --> 03:01:57,190
Distracted.

3381
03:01:57,450 --> 03:01:57,670
Me?

3382
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:00,090
I'm distracted by what?

3383
03:02:00,990 --> 03:02:01,630
Rough terrain?

3384
03:02:02,050 --> 03:02:02,730
Wait, what am I doing?

3385
03:02:06,270 --> 03:02:07,930
What is... Let's see.

3386
03:02:08,310 --> 03:02:09,070
Oh yeah, that's right.

3387
03:02:09,130 --> 03:02:10,650
Remove a random threat.

3388
03:02:14,050 --> 03:02:14,830
Screw it.

3389
03:02:15,410 --> 03:02:15,950
It's worth.

3390
03:02:16,270 --> 03:02:17,270
Oh, my gas is low.

3391
03:02:17,490 --> 03:02:18,370
Maybe it wasn't worth.

3392
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:19,970
What does the dog do?

3393
03:02:21,410 --> 03:02:21,970
Nothing.

3394
03:02:29,890 --> 03:02:30,650
It's OK.

3395
03:02:30,750 --> 03:02:31,030
We're out.

3396
03:02:32,250 --> 03:02:33,810
The dog gives motivation.

3397
03:02:33,930 --> 03:02:34,910
What just happened?

3398
03:02:38,470 --> 03:02:40,330
The punk has reached level 2.

3399
03:02:43,370 --> 03:02:44,470
Let's go, punk.

3400
03:02:46,330 --> 03:02:49,210
I think we'll have enough gas until the next place probably.

3401
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:52,470
Behind large truck.

3402
03:02:54,290 --> 03:02:56,010
Get me out of here.

3403
03:03:00,090 --> 03:03:01,510
OK, give shield.

3404
03:03:02,230 --> 03:03:04,850
Why are the enemies getting so tough all of a sudden?

3405
03:03:09,410 --> 03:03:11,070
Use mechanic related items.

3406
03:03:11,190 --> 03:03:11,850
We got a new trait.

3407
03:03:12,390 --> 03:03:12,850
Mechanic.

3408
03:03:12,970 --> 03:03:14,210
Get better prices at garages.

3409
03:03:14,350 --> 03:03:14,910
OK, let's go.

3410
03:03:14,910 --> 03:03:14,970
No.

3411
03:03:18,470 --> 03:03:19,450
OK.

3412
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:25,210
We're stressed.

3413
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:26,810
No, we're stressed.

3414
03:03:27,310 --> 03:03:31,270
OK, this could be worse.

3415
03:03:34,490 --> 03:03:35,470
Perfect.

3416
03:03:36,750 --> 03:03:38,570
OK, it could be worse.

3417
03:03:40,130 --> 03:03:41,370
It could be worse.

3418
03:03:42,210 --> 03:03:44,010
All hitchhikers are asleep.

3419
03:03:44,190 --> 03:03:45,030
Oh, my god.

3420
03:03:47,470 --> 03:03:48,450
We're fine.

3421
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:50,170
Probably.

3422
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:56,140
It kind of was a waste, but that's fine.

3423
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:01,840
Why don't I get any of the social ones anymore?

3424
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:04,960
New journey inheritance.

3425
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:08,980
This is your grandmother's physician.

3426
03:04:09,140 --> 03:04:10,960
There's no easy way...

3427
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:24,050
The timing.

3428
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:38,360
Oh, the timing.

3429
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:38,420
The timing.

3430
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:59,790
The cancer has completely metastasized and she is left with only a couple days left before total body failure.

3431
03:05:00,530 --> 03:05:02,610
Come by the treatment center as soon as you can.

3432
03:05:03,150 --> 03:05:04,170
My condolences.

3433
03:05:06,790 --> 03:05:08,130
Don't take any durability.

3434
03:05:08,770 --> 03:05:09,590
Good driver.

3435
03:05:10,150 --> 03:05:10,890
Drive faster.

3436
03:05:11,070 --> 03:05:11,770
OK, let's go.

3437
03:05:12,930 --> 03:05:14,230
I can't read the train.

3438
03:05:14,470 --> 03:05:17,450
Or I can't... I don't know what it said.

3439
03:05:17,650 --> 03:05:19,170
We have to get all the way over there?

3440
03:05:19,630 --> 03:05:20,370
There's no way.

3441
03:05:20,590 --> 03:05:21,350
Grandma's dying.

3442
03:05:29,420 --> 03:05:31,280
Is there a gas station here?

3443
03:05:31,380 --> 03:05:32,500
There is not.

3444
03:05:34,540 --> 03:05:35,960
Oh, it's closed.

3445
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:36,940
That's OK.

3446
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:37,940
We have to rest anyway.

3447
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:44,400
Why are we tired?

3448
03:05:44,500 --> 03:05:45,340
We just rested.

3449
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:47,980
It's still closed.

3450
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:49,800
And we're cold.

3451
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:51,280
Is this closed?

3452
03:05:51,860 --> 03:05:52,240
No.

3453
03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:55,960
Repair, please.

3454
03:05:56,640 --> 03:05:58,940
We'll do a full repair.

3455
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:07,680
Yeah, I would get more jerrycans, but...

3456
03:06:09,580 --> 03:06:12,500
Oh wait, we can buy this one at least.

3457
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:19,060
Yeah, I'm gonna buy it.

3458
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:21,640
Well, it's so expensive.

3459
03:06:21,900 --> 03:06:22,800
No, I'll save it.

3460
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:23,180
I'll save.

3461
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:24,300
I'll save.

3462
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,140
What's in here?

3463
03:06:29,260 --> 03:06:32,460
Exploring the open world.

3464
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:35,460
Stretching my legs a little bit.

3465
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:36,640
Explore.

3466
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:38,580
There's a rock in my way.

3467
03:06:39,440 --> 03:06:44,480
Is there anything in here for me to take?

3468
03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:47,500
A spooky cave.

3469
03:06:50,140 --> 03:06:51,920
We got some mushrooms.

3470
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:53,780
Probably.

3471
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:57,200
What else is in here?

3472
03:07:06,400 --> 03:07:07,360
The rock.

3473
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:11,980
I hope there's monsters in some of these.

3474
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:13,120
I sure hope not.

3475
03:07:13,340 --> 03:07:13,860
What do you think?

3476
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:16,080
We're back at the beginning.

3477
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:20,040
Did I go every way?

3478
03:07:22,180 --> 03:07:23,000
Maybe I did.

3479
03:07:24,820 --> 03:07:25,300
No?

3480
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:26,680
Maybe I didn't?

3481
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:27,980
I can't tell.

3482
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:29,500
Oh, we found more?

3483
03:07:30,580 --> 03:07:31,060
Let's go.

3484
03:07:32,260 --> 03:07:34,180
Come on, give me an abandoned tent.

3485
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:36,360
Give me some of the good stuff.

3486
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:38,140
Give me the magazines.

3487
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:38,480
Give me some coins.

3488
03:07:45,880 --> 03:07:53,560
Sometimes though I think the little water droplets are something spooky.

3489
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:55,080
Oops, mushrooms.

3490
03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:57,100
You know what?

3491
03:07:57,100 --> 03:07:58,020
I'm gonna go sell them.

3492
03:07:58,720 --> 03:07:59,840
I'm gonna sell the mushrooms.

3493
03:08:02,740 --> 03:08:05,240
We'll take them and we'll sell them.

3494
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:08,660
All of them.

3495
03:08:12,450 --> 03:08:13,170
I miss Mito.

3496
03:08:13,370 --> 03:08:15,070
She's gone to Japan for so long.

3497
03:08:15,170 --> 03:08:16,670
No, I'm right here!

3498
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:19,830
Enter.

3499
03:08:22,590 --> 03:08:23,370
Still closed?

3500
03:08:23,470 --> 03:08:24,190
Ok, we'll sleep.

3501
03:08:27,870 --> 03:08:29,430
Now it's open.

3502
03:08:33,850 --> 03:08:35,270
We're still cold.

3503
03:08:38,010 --> 03:08:39,170
This is a cafe!

3504
03:08:39,370 --> 03:08:40,290
It is not a store.

3505
03:08:40,490 --> 03:08:41,230
Oh my gosh.

3506
03:08:41,390 --> 03:08:41,610
Oops.

3507
03:08:43,270 --> 03:08:44,390
Deliver some boxes.

3508
03:08:47,290 --> 03:08:48,570
We can get a hot drink.

3509
03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:50,070
Actually, wait, I can sell them here.

3510
03:09:01,890 --> 03:09:04,650
When I close my eyes it's like she's speaking to us.

3511
03:09:04,730 --> 03:09:06,130
I'm talking to you!

3512
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:09,230
Oops.

3513
03:09:10,830 --> 03:09:12,370
Now we're not cold anymore.

3514
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:15,370
Cinnabon.

3515
03:09:16,150 --> 03:09:17,170
I'm starting to get hungry.

3516
03:09:17,310 --> 03:09:21,670
I should eat before... before collab.

3517
03:09:24,130 --> 03:09:25,750
I wanna keep playing this though.

3518
03:09:25,870 --> 03:09:27,090
Oh my gosh, it's kind of addicting.

3519
03:09:27,930 --> 03:09:29,450
It's kind of really addicting.

3520
03:09:30,450 --> 03:09:30,910
Oh no.

3521
03:09:31,890 --> 03:09:33,350
Alright, alright, alright.

3522
03:09:33,510 --> 03:09:34,450
But we gotta get to the cat.

3523
03:09:34,630 --> 03:09:35,830
We gotta get the cat home.

3524
03:09:36,170 --> 03:09:37,110
We're so close.

3525
03:09:39,230 --> 03:09:40,490
We're so close.

3526
03:09:41,810 --> 03:09:42,290
Next!

3527
03:09:44,430 --> 03:09:45,390
Next stop.

3528
03:09:47,370 --> 03:09:48,330
To Fardorf!

3529
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:49,590
Away!

3530
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:55,400
I'm losing... Hold on.

3531
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:58,480
I'm losing Mito and all of Holo Oshis for a month.

3532
03:09:59,120 --> 03:09:59,800
A month?

3533
03:10:00,160 --> 03:10:01,720
I'm not gonna be gone for a month.

3534
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:03,200
What are you talking about?

3535
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:07,700
I'm gone for a week.

3536
03:10:12,480 --> 03:10:18,320
C-E-X-69-9 Oh man, too good.

3537
03:10:18,620 --> 03:10:20,860
I'd be so embarrassed with that license plate.

3538
03:10:22,020 --> 03:10:23,920
Oh man, too good.

3539
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:25,660
I wish mine was better.

3540
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:29,500
What's wrong?

3541
03:10:29,760 --> 03:10:30,840
Oh no, we're hungry!

3542
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:33,320
How did I not notice?

3543
03:10:33,440 --> 03:10:34,260
Time for berries.

3544
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,760
Alright, on the road again.

3545
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,620
A year without Minky?

3546
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:41,180
No!

3547
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:42,900
I'm right here.

3548
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:49,040
Near Dorf, Fardorf, wherever you are, Dorf.

3549
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:54,260
I like how I'm still using this energy drink.

3550
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:56,040
Itasha.

3551
03:10:56,040 --> 03:11:00,540
I don't think this lady has brought us any luck.

3552
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:03,040
I don't think she's a lady luck after all.

3553
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:07,620
Majestic Falcon!

3554
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:13,180
Perfect.

3555
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:17,980
Guess we'll just get rid of one.

3556
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:21,300
Heavy rain, add one durability threat.

3557
03:11:21,440 --> 03:11:21,740
No!

3558
03:11:24,320 --> 03:11:25,680
Oh come on.

3559
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:30,860
Perfect.

3560
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:34,380
Oh, extra turn, let's use the cigarettes.

3561
03:11:35,400 --> 03:11:35,860
Nice.

3562
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:40,800
Road phase, give debuff to 3 random threat.

3563
03:11:45,990 --> 03:11:48,610
Alright, threat averted.

3564
03:11:49,110 --> 03:11:51,790
Goodbye Majestic Eagle Falcon.

3565
03:11:56,190 --> 03:11:58,730
Oh, my iTunes!

3566
03:11:59,110 --> 03:11:59,670
How could I forget?

3567
03:11:59,670 --> 03:12:04,510
Sorry guys, we've been trackless for so long.

3568
03:12:10,110 --> 03:12:10,910
Tailgating car!

3569
03:12:12,170 --> 03:12:13,510
I hope you enjoy the collab in Japan.

3570
03:12:13,710 --> 03:12:15,510
Have fun with your first cafe collab.

3571
03:12:15,630 --> 03:12:17,610
By the way, I'm glad you like the Arctic Mission artist.

3572
03:12:18,290 --> 03:12:19,570
Oh, thanks Mirrorlit!

3573
03:12:20,910 --> 03:12:21,850
Oh my gosh!

3574
03:12:23,770 --> 03:12:24,770
This guy is an asshole.

3575
03:12:26,330 --> 03:12:28,050
Thank you for the pink by the way.

3576
03:12:28,230 --> 03:12:29,050
I appreciate it.

3577
03:12:31,430 --> 03:12:32,410
Oh my god!

3578
03:12:34,410 --> 03:12:35,910
He's honking at me!

3579
03:12:38,170 --> 03:12:39,330
All threat to attack.

3580
03:12:39,750 --> 03:12:40,210
Unlucky.

3581
03:12:40,310 --> 03:12:41,230
How do we keep getting unlucky?

3582
03:12:41,350 --> 03:12:42,610
We're supposed to have a hula lady.

3583
03:12:50,130 --> 03:12:53,190
The driving test really don't prepare you for how many birds you have to fight.

3584
03:12:54,750 --> 03:12:55,650
It's true.

3585
03:12:59,010 --> 03:13:04,430
If you brake and he hits you, you get the money.

3586
03:13:04,790 --> 03:13:07,330
So honestly, it's like a win to me, baby.

3587
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:22,310
I like this West Coast band.

3588
03:13:23,670 --> 03:13:24,490
Oh, no car holes.

3589
03:13:25,850 --> 03:13:26,690
Yeah, it's his fault.

3590
03:13:27,410 --> 03:13:30,190
I kind of wish someone would hit me so I could get a new car.

3591
03:13:33,270 --> 03:13:35,190
I kind of wish that...

3592
03:13:37,270 --> 03:13:39,010
You know, someone would hit me.

3593
03:13:40,070 --> 03:13:41,190
And then I could...

3594
03:13:43,630 --> 03:13:44,530
Oh, whoops, wrong one.

3595
03:13:47,450 --> 03:13:48,650
I could get the money.

3596
03:13:49,630 --> 03:13:51,410
It'd be kind of nice, I'm not gonna lie.

3597
03:13:51,410 --> 03:13:51,470
Okay.

3598
03:13:54,610 --> 03:13:55,170
Ouch.

3599
03:13:57,230 --> 03:13:58,770
Alright, Minto, buckle up.

3600
03:13:59,490 --> 03:13:59,950
Yeah.

3601
03:14:11,010 --> 03:14:12,250
15 minutes to collab?

3602
03:14:12,370 --> 03:14:13,050
Oh, shit!

3603
03:14:17,430 --> 03:14:19,230
Oh, I think they're messaging me.

3604
03:14:31,640 --> 03:14:32,200
Wait.

3605
03:14:56,120 --> 03:14:56,840
Oh, introspection.

3606
03:14:56,960 --> 03:14:57,580
Sorry, I was reading.

3607
03:14:57,880 --> 03:14:59,280
I had a lot of DMs.

3608
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:01,380
Introspection.

3609
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:02,900
Jeez, this road is really boring.

3610
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:04,900
Look out the door.

3611
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:06,020
No, keep your eyes on the road.

3612
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:09,500
Not a bend or curve or even some nice nature.

3613
03:15:09,860 --> 03:15:10,980
There's nature everywhere.

3614
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:12,320
What are you talking about?

3615
03:15:13,260 --> 03:15:14,060
Oh, we're tired.

3616
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:18,620
Look out the window.

3617
03:15:18,820 --> 03:15:19,320
Do it.

3618
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:22,340
Here!

3619
03:15:22,740 --> 03:15:23,780
Lady, your cat!

3620
03:15:26,320 --> 03:15:31,660
You found... She's been standing out here for days, even in the rain.

3621
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,740
Oh my god!

3622
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:37,660
We got a hundred dollars!

3623
03:15:40,200 --> 03:15:42,580
She's my best friend!

3624
03:15:42,580 --> 03:15:42,680
Ah!

3625
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:48,700
We did it, baby!

3626
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:55,300
We did it!

3627
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:56,920
A toolbox.

3628
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,440
Oh, nice.

3629
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:01,120
You know what?

3630
03:16:01,620 --> 03:16:04,860
This jerrycan is less expensive.

3631
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:06,020
Let's get it.

3632
03:16:12,640 --> 03:16:13,980
Were we cold earlier?

3633
03:16:14,180 --> 03:16:15,300
No, we were hot earlier.

3634
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:16,060
Now we're tired.

3635
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:18,820
Alright.

3636
03:16:18,820 --> 03:16:19,960
What a deal.

3637
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:21,480
Chicken wings!

3638
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:22,680
You're starving?

3639
03:16:23,440 --> 03:16:25,460
You can get that bad?

3640
03:16:26,900 --> 03:16:28,460
That doesn't sound so good.

3641
03:16:29,060 --> 03:16:33,160
Let's get some... We don't need the soap because we still have the toilet paper.

3642
03:16:34,320 --> 03:16:36,380
We still have a good amount of cigarettes.

3643
03:16:38,740 --> 03:16:39,200
Beans.

3644
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:42,760
What's this one?

3645
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:43,320
Toilet paper.

3646
03:16:43,420 --> 03:16:44,420
Oh, we got more toilet paper.

3647
03:16:49,930 --> 03:16:51,970
No, back it up, back it up.

3648
03:16:52,170 --> 03:16:53,030
Any hotdogs?

3649
03:16:54,090 --> 03:16:55,130
Nothing of the sort.

3650
03:16:57,770 --> 03:16:58,890
No hotdogs.

3651
03:17:00,130 --> 03:17:01,630
I'm gonna fill up my gas.

3652
03:17:05,530 --> 03:17:06,250
Let's see.

3653
03:17:06,390 --> 03:17:07,970
Let's get to like...

3654
03:17:08,570 --> 03:17:09,150
You know what?

3655
03:17:09,830 --> 03:17:10,850
We did good.

3656
03:17:11,590 --> 03:17:13,590
We deserve a full tank of gas.

3657
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:16,670
We deserve a full tank of gas, baby.

3658
03:17:16,670 --> 03:17:22,770
And with that, I'm gonna go make a waiting room for my next collab in 10 minutes.

3659
03:17:23,950 --> 03:17:25,650
I have to install the game.

3660
03:17:25,870 --> 03:17:26,270
Oh my gosh.

3661
03:17:26,810 --> 03:17:27,690
Thank you guys!

3662
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:28,330
Otsumito!

3663
03:17:31,250 --> 03:17:31,750
Here.

3664
03:17:33,270 --> 03:17:35,890
Actually, while I'm here, let me just make the thumbnail.

3665
03:17:36,370 --> 03:17:36,850
Zort.

3666
03:17:37,530 --> 03:17:38,590
Zort game.

3667
03:17:39,150 --> 03:17:39,890
Let's see.

3668
03:17:40,850 --> 03:17:44,910
Actually, we'll listen to the music, you know?

3669
03:17:45,930 --> 03:17:47,490
What the heck is this game?

3670
03:17:47,890 --> 03:17:51,050
Oh, this is Doki's suggestion by the way, so...

3671
03:17:51,550 --> 03:17:53,450
I don't know what this is.

3672
03:17:53,650 --> 03:17:54,070
Zort.

3673
03:17:56,370 --> 03:17:56,830
Zort.

3674
03:17:58,890 --> 03:18:00,670
I'm making a thumbnail right now.

3675
03:18:02,350 --> 03:18:03,890
This game is so fun though.

3676
03:18:03,950 --> 03:18:05,050
I wanna keep driving.

3677
03:18:05,930 --> 03:18:06,570
Get it?

3678
03:18:06,890 --> 03:18:08,110
I wanna keep driving.

3679
03:18:08,990 --> 03:18:09,870
That's the name of the game.

3680
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:20,440
That's the name of the game, baby.

3681
03:18:21,420 --> 03:18:22,220
Title drop.

3682
03:18:22,320 --> 03:18:23,000
Roll credits.

3683
03:18:24,400 --> 03:18:25,020
Otsumito, everybody!

3684
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:26,540
Thank you so much!

3685
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:29,780
I'll see you guys if you come to the collab, and if not, I'll see you later.

3686
03:18:29,980 --> 03:18:31,220
I'll see you when I'm back from Japan!

3687
03:18:32,500 --> 03:18:32,900
Otsumito!

3688
03:18:33,480 --> 03:18:37,060
And if I see you at the collaboration cafe...

3689
03:18:38,580 --> 03:18:40,020
Take lots of pictures, okay?

3690
03:18:42,280 --> 03:18:44,060
Or you'll see me on Twitter too, you know?

3691
03:18:44,200 --> 03:18:45,940
I'll be posting, of course, obviously.

3692
03:18:46,480 --> 03:18:47,240
Bye bye!
