20
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,950

I'm excited.

24
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,710
This has been fun so far.

25
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,050
Yeah!

26
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,870

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,130
Oh, it's already the fourth here.

28
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,630
I thought it said your fourth birthday.

29
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,170
Watching this while making Wisp charms to bring Safer of Expo.

30
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,590
Zubu!

31
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,610

Happy happy birthday About my gamer subs merch And wore the shirt to work The back was covered Okay good

33
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:31,030
Rodrigo thank you She's addicted to the grind I don't know there was something about it Maybe like it was like a trauma bonding event Or something I don't know how to explain it I don't know I just really liked it I also can't stop playing the water park game Why did you do this to me?

34
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,850
Oh, so invisible boost.

35
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,670
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

36
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,630
Thank you.

37
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,650
Thank you.

38
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,470
Thank you.

39
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,230
Surely it wasn't the swimsuits.

40
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,190
I mean.

41
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,070
No, I don't know.

42
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:56,090
It was something about the rush and just running around and mopping stuff up and serving hot dogs and lemonade.

43
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,030
myself.

44
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,170
But it also had me thinking.

45
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,010
So I don't think I talked about this.

46
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:17,570
But when I during MGSCon, I had the chance to go to a theme park I've never been to before.

47
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,230
And it was Knott's Berry Farm.

48
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,210
And guys, I can't stop thinking about that place either.

49
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,330
I had never been to Knott's Berry Farm.

50
00:07:28,390 --> 00:08:56,750
before and it was it was so good oh my gosh I loved it I loved it I was too shy to meet Snoopy I was too shy to meet Snoopy but I went on every single big roller coaster and there was one roller coaster there that I can't stop thinking about called hang time and oh my gosh it was so oh my gosh so it's like a it's like a what's it called it's like a surfing theme surfing surfing theme roller coaster and at night at night it's lit up where so first you do like a 90 degree going up like you are your back and you're like going up the incline and you're like whoa my gosh that was my least favorite part i didn't like that and then then you like hang a little bit over the edge just so and then you're just kind of sitting there and you're like and then it drops you but the rest of the ride is so smooth it's so smooth and like the loops are kind of slow So,

51
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:04,790
like, you really feel like you're, like, riding a wave, and you're like, oh, like, oh, my gosh, it feels so good.

52
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,750
I can't stop thinking about that ride.

53
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,650
I can't stop thinking about Knott's Berry Farm, and I want to go back, and I want to ride Hang Time.

54
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,610
Oh, my God.

55
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,970
It's super duper smooth.

56
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,150
Ah, did you ride Ghost Rider?

57
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,250
I rode Ghost Rider.

58
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,730
I rode every roller coaster.

59
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,750
Because I love roller coasters.

60
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,010
Did you do accelerator?

61
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,590
Mm-hmm.

62
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,390
That's the one that's like mini King de Cot, right?

63
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,610
Yeah, I love roller coasters.

64
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,250
Was your butt also too big to fit in the seats, like shacks?

65
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,930
Yeah, pretty much.

66
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,070
Freaking Barry's tweet about that.

67
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,490
Also, Logan, thank you so much for the time, guys.

68
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,710
Thank you.

69
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,310
Yeah.

70
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,240
I love roller coasters.

71
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,100
Wait, King Dakar is dead now?

72
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,200
Aw, man.

73
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,700
Wait, I think I remember hearing about that, actually.

74
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes, yes.

75
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
Curse of the big butt.

76
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,980
But yeah, I think even if you don't like roller coasters, I think hang time is really smooth.

77
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,260
The initial part is, like, really nerve-wracking, I'll be honest.

78
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,200
But the rest of the ride is so smooth and feels so good.

79
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,380
Feels so good.

80
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,300
Feels really like you're surfing.

81
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,620
Oh, I love, I love.

82
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,300
And then, I don't think I've ever heard of Knott's Berry Farm until now.

83
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,340
And then, this is also really cool.

84
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,620
They are originally a berry farm, so they grow the poison berries.

85
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,800
And I got to try so many different poison berry things.

86
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,980
I even got to try poison berry dip and dots.

87
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,320
Yeah!

88
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,460
I got that.

89
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,660
And then, um...

90
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,260
I tried some Boisenberry cheesecake.

91
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
And I had Boisenberry...

92
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,540
Bubble tea!

93
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,340
Oh, I forgot to move the notice.

94
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,260
My bad, hold on.

95
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,920
Wait, one second.

96
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,780
Back to where they were.

97
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,200
There we go.

98
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,220
Thank you!

99
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,480
Thanks, Logan.

100
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,740
And...

101
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,900
Um...

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
That was about what I ate.

103
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,640
If you're ever in Utah, somehow I highly recommend Lagoon.

104
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,720
Very fun and cool roller coasters.

105
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,920
I want to go to every amusement park, theme park in the world.

106
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,820
I feel cheated.

107
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,900
Nots was lame-o when I was a kid.

108
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
Oh, did they not have, like, the good rides?

109
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,300
No, it's good.

110
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,800
It's really good, and there's Snoopy?

111
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,320
Snoopy everywhere?

112
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,540
I really wanted a woodstock.

113
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,220
You know, he had the woodstock is the bird.

114
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,980
They had little woodstock headbands.

115
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,640
I wanted Snoopy ear headbands, but they only had, like, light-up ones, and they were hard and heavy.

116
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,940
And I wanted floppy Snoopy ears.

117
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,260
Vivi Korn, thanks for the gift.

118
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,820
Thank you.

119
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,320
And, uh, well, did I say your name right?

120
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,880
I hope so.

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,740
for the deck of the...

122
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,060
That's poisoned.

123
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
Bum, bum, bum.

124
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah.

125
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,180
Kids today don't know peanuts.

126
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,760
No, they will if they go to Knott's Berry Farm and they'll see Snoopy.

127
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,860
And I got to ride a couple Snoopy rides.

128
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,900
I was very happy.

129
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,380
One was like a little ride where you go through the camp with, you know, you see little Snoopy.

130
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:45,300
He's like, fish and you see other peanuts characters and they're like we're at the camp and we are we are having a camp competition and i was like so it's so cute it's so cute yeah um i went on one ride that was uh it was a snoopy roller coaster and it was so cute i and i liked it a lot it was so cute because they were they were they would have you go twice and when they pass you through the second time they're like one more time it was so cute

131
00:13:49,360 --> 00:14:01,440
so and also the crowd there was like nobody there which it was really awesome and then at that And then that night, they had like this, they had like a live band.

132
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,560
And so I got to listen to that.

133
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,860
And they had like a jazz band and everything.

134
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,120
And there were people like, like, like swing dancing and stuff.

135
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
And it was really nice.

136
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,780
I was like, wait, this is, this is so cute.

137
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,560
And I went on a train and then I got, the train got attacked by people.

138
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,740
And it was so fun.

139
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,500
It was so fun.

140
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,700
I love theme parks.

141
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,800
Yeah.

142
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,360
Sounds like a really fun day.

143
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,140
It was.

144
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,940
If you ever get a chance to go to Knott's Berry Farm.

145
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,020
I recommend it so much.

146
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,740
It was so good.

147
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,780
Yeah, we were attacked by bandits.

148
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,900
They came and they were like, Hey, you got it.

149
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,640
You got where's your gold?

150
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,780
And I was like, um, I don't have any.

151
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,020
Yeah, I have.

152
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,180
That's, um...

153
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,980
I lied.

154
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,980
You see the trailer for that Snoopy mystery game?

155
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,600
No?

156
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,220
I didn't?

157
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,380
We love you, boys.

158
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,260
I love you.

159
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,820
You should have gone to Great America when you were at Off-Kai.

160
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Oh, yeah!

161
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,980
Oh, yeah.

162
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,780
They're planning to close the park in 2027.

163
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,840
Well, that means next off, Kai, I could go.

164
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,700
My favorite there is Flight Deck.

165
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,840
It used to be called Top Gun.

166
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,540
There was, uh, there was another Top Gun ride.

167
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,360
Uh, oh gosh, I remember mmm, was it North Carolina?

168
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,280
South Carolina?

169
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,640
Some, some southern state.

170
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,560
I think?

171
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,020
There was a Top Gun ride.

172
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
I can't remember.

173
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:01,820
Carowins?

174
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Was it?

175
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
The Carowins one?

176
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,540
Where is it?

177
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,040
Hold on.

178
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm so bad at a map.

179
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,480
Okay, Carowins.

180
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,280
Yeah, Carowins North Carolina had the top gun ride.

181
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
Yes, yes.

182
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,360
Yes.

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,860

Yes.

187
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,440
I knew there was another Top Gun, and I was sad because I didn't know about it until I liked Top Gun, and now I can't ever ride it.

188
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,400
It was so sad, but, you know, the bandits will remember you live.

189
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,280
Have you ever seen Carpet Bagger?

190
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,900
He makes YouTube videos about theme parks and roadside attractions.

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,500
He's a great person.

192
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,400
I've never seen him.

193
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,200

Yeah.

198
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,630

I don't think I took any photos.

201
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,590
I don't think I did.

202
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,990
Oh, wait, no, that's a lie.

203
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,510
I took some pictures of Little Snake.

204

I took pictures of Snake with Snoopy.

205
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,650
I took pictures of Snake in jail.

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:34,050
I took pictures of Snoopy when I was When I was riding, the ride was Snoopy.

207
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,430
I took...

208
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,230
Those are the only pictures I took.

209
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,170
Oh, I took a picture of a tree.

210
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,150
That looked like a...

211
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,190
Like a hairless cat.

212
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,190

273
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,320
So going up, I wish I had a pointer.

274
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:31,800
Hold on.

275
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,520
Let me get a pointer.

276
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Let me get a pointer.

277
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
I'm going to use this party hat.

278
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,280
Okay.

279
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,720
Look at the tip of the party hat.

280
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,480
So here, this is like the incline, right?

281
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,880
You're on your back going up.

282
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,100
And this part is like kind of like a gold, like an orangey color.

283
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,240
And it's supposed to be like the sand.

284
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,020
And then you're over here.

285
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,440
And you're still in the sand.

286
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:58,620
And then you've got to go in this this is when this is this is when it turns blue and it looks like the water it's so so pretty at night i'd be terrified on the way up no i mean i was but right here is actually not so bad either and the drop the drop is not a 90 degree angle it's kind of like a little bit it's it's a little bit inward so the drop is not so bad you know if you really hate that pit that feeling in your tummy you don't really feel it because it's not like a you feel those kind of you feel that worse if it's like it's a little inverted so um yeah you don't feel it so bad the drop curves yeah yeah yeah yeah and so then you and it's really smooth it's so good but i just thought this was pretty yeah no it's very fun we're so cute okay let's my stories.

287
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,680
We can play the game now.

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,440
We can play the game now.

Thanks for listening to my stories.

290
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,420
But the incline is so bad.

291
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,960
The incline sucks.

292
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,320
Because it feels like you're about to fall, like it feels like you're gonna slip out because you're laying back so much, you know?

293
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,840
Ugh!

We're just gonna ignore the fact that we met a bunch of cannibals.

300
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,500
They're upset that I called it so quickly.

301
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,420
The game is mad.

302
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,840
They're like, you didn't guess it.

303
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
They just weren't that important.

304
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,320
The Walking Dead.

305
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,580
National Guard orders evacuation of city.

306
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,600

Is that where you got it, Sean?

312
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,800
Where do you come down on staying or going?

313
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,960
You mean packing up the motel and getting in the RV?

314
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,140
Yeah, we've been talking about it, but have you made up your mind yet?

315
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,340
Um, we could split up.

316
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,040
We should go.

317
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,880
We should go.

318
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,860
I want to go on an adventure.

319
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,240
Motels run its course, and it's not safe.

320
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:41,640
Yeah.

321
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,920
You're damn right it has.

322
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,040
We pile into the RV and don't pull over till we see water.

323
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,480
And if Lily's dead set on staying, then, well, that's the way it goes.

324
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,680
I mean, yeah, because now you know there's bandits in the area, I think, right?

325
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,140
Like, I wouldn't want to stay.

326
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
Okay, just like last time.

327
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,220
Over the rig, into the pharmacy, and scrape together whatever supplies are left.

328
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:04,940
Okay.

329
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,100
We didn't leave much in there.

330
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,240
Hey, we're out of options.

331
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,740
Something's better than nothing.

332
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,990
How would a zombie climb up?

333
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,330

00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,950
I'm not sure how many more trips she's got in her.

337
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,670
I'm not sure how many more trips we've got in us.

338
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,190
No kidding.

339
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:30,770
Okay.

340
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,450
Look at the wind.

341
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,630
Okay.

342
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,730
What else we got going on around here?

343
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,010
We got a Jeep.

344
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,330
We've got debris.

345
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,910

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,010
I just realized that this is the prescription.

349
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,050
Not prescription.

350
00:29:59,410 --> 00:29:59,670
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:59,730 --> 00:29:59,890
Sorry.

352
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,890
I read the prescription thing.

353
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,950
This is the place we start, like his family's drugstore, no?

354
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,330
They're blocked by all the fallen concrete.

355
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:10,670

Doug.

364
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,050
This is where we lost him.

365
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,390

366
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,030

Okay, I get it.

371
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,290
The Jeep is there.

372
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,350

373
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,350

Oh, come on.

380
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,450
How did a zombie take down a helicopter?

381
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,030
Okay, but say that to Resident Evil as well, because the same exact thing happened.

I won't.

392
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,960
I just don't know.

393
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,230
We attach it.

394
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,100
Okay.

395
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,540

Wait, do you think that was Doug's store?

No.

400
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,980
There's no way.

401
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,160
Oh.

402
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,960
Look at the control.

403
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,960
There we go.

404
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:42,740
Oh.

I hope not.

410
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,980
She'll get there.

411
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,180
I didn't take anything.

412
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,840
I was good.

413
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,320

Yeah, think about it.

446
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,200
We're always worrying about the ones we can't see.

447
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,740
She stays alive and brings them all out of their holes.

448
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,180
Yeah, she's a goner.

449
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,980

We can't do anything.

454
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,500
We should be good to clear this place out.

455
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,660

468
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:20,930

520
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,850
How did she lure them all to...

521
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,290
us so quickly?

522
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,290
What are all these arrows?

523
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,950
Oh my gosh!

524
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,690
Wait, we're getting a attacked by the people so much?

525
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,610
Also, they said that they didn't, like, clear out the pharmacy, but there was still a lot of stuff.

526
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,530
I'm not gonna lie.

527
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,170
The bandits are insane.

528
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,670
Aw, Clem.

529
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,670
You're back.

530
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,730
Ben found some stickers in a drawer and I put them on my walkie.

531
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,510
So cute.

532
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,050
Hey, sweet pea.

533
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,270
That's neat.

534
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,930
I'll find you in a minute.

535
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,710
So cute.

536
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:52,850
So cute.

537
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,510
He's so cute.

538
00:39:59,460 --> 00:39:59,980
Hi.

539
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,000
Looks like we got the kid on watch again.

540
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:03,860
What'd you get?

541
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,340
Might as well leave a sign out that says the men are going and come and rape our women and children.

542
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,180
Huh.

543
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,140
So, what did you get?

544
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,180
Uh, uh, what was left?

545
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,560
Just what was left.

546
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,140
Which was a lot, actually.

547
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,140
Take a look.

548
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,720
Kenny, chill.

549
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,680
Chill, Kenny.

550
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,180
We're fine, by the way.

551
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,820
Nice work.

552
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,080
This will keep us going.

553
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,840
If we carry on like this, we'll get through the winter here.

554
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,600
The winter?

555
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:34,920
What?

556
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,240
We'll freeze our asses off here.

557
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,000
Right, yeah, what?

558
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,380
Just piling into an RV with you, too, after what you did to my dad is so appealing.

559
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,140
You can leave.

560
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,060
You know, I'll do what it takes to keep everyone safe.

561
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,920
We're already safe.

562
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,940
We do whatever is best for the kids.

563
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,840
That's not graffiti.

564
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,220
Those are bullet holes.

565
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,980
And we got enough arrow shafts sticking out of it to dry our life.

566
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:52,160
if you say that we do whatever is best for the kids yeah doesn't that make sense yeah it's suicide out there we'll die in here you're right you could see someone sleeping and kill one of us sleeping okay girl girl let's not be dramatic don't boss your dad was i'm sorry somebody needs to make executive decisions for the group though and i don't think you're capable anymore don't start with yeah you're gonna stop everything can't come down to the same disagreement we're gonna be points here yeah i'm so tired of it being you two versus damn it i'm not on anyone's side lily these decisions affect everyone what about the food situation what about protection what about when this place falls somebody's got to be thinking about this how has this not been working we have everything we need because of me lily that's bs k we got and you we got plenty of food from that station wagon you didn't even want to take it oh wait where the hell would we be now i forgot not the station i just keep our

567
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:49,220
fingers crossed from station wagons everything that happens to us is another excuse for you to pull this crap about leaving all I want is a week of peace of not hearing it do you know how we got these supplies we got lucky let a girl get out there what some girl came screaming out of an alley she had dead hanging all over her she gave us enough time to get everything we could out of the drugstore and you just let suffer like what like bait oh god what is happening well i mean she was dead you guys couldn't try to save her don't take that tone with him she was dead kenny why did you tell them that it made the most sense in the morning why did you tell him that kenny wait a second kenny putting our lives on the line doing these runs into the city kenny you're making us look the shit we see we all appreciate it ken you should be thanking lee for not shooting that girl it's not so easy for him Look,

568
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,420
Makin and its people aren't savable.

569
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,540
It's not a town.

570
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,920
It's full of walkers.

571
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,420
And the people who were left are dying and wandering out onto the streets.

572
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,340
It's hell on earth, and it's coming this way.

573
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,080
It's not going to be easier out on the road.

574
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,480
How would you know?

575
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,460
What I know?

576
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,440
I know you're not above murder.

577
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,260
I know somebody has been stealing our supplies.

578
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,180
That's right.

579
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,020
Stealing!

580
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,280
And I know the list of people I can trust here gets smaller every day.

581
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,920
Everybody get out!

582
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,180
I think it's Ben.

583
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,940
Ben is stealing.

584
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,400
I don't trust that guy.

585
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,880
We don't know him.

586
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,020
Uh, she'll get over it.

587
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,360
She'll get over it.

588
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,460
She's riling everybody up, otherwise.

589
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,840
You understand.

590
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,820
She's right about one thing.

591
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,540
I love being called cool as a pickle.

592
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah, they'll get over it.

593
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
That's my solution to everything.

594
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,760
They'll get over it.

595
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,760
Things are coming to a head.

596
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,740
Oh my gosh.

597
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,480
You could say that.

598
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,180
I would say it's safer here.

599
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,460
Well, I think you did good today.

600
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,420
And I find myself thinking that most days.

601
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,380
If not for the bandits.

602
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,180
You know?

603
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,720
Thanks.

604
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,580
It's probably worth following up with Lily about what she was saying about missing supplies.

605
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,540
With her wound up the way she is, I don't want to see her paranoid.

606
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,720
I think Doug would have touched us that way.

607
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,180
No question.

608
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,460
And I'd like to talk when you've got a minute.

609
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,020
Hmm.

610
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,080
Maybe.

611
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:20,780
Maybe.

612
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,180
Maybe.

613
00:44:22,900 --> 00:45:07,860
when in doubt choose they'll get over it yeah no i think staying here would probably be a safer option if not for the bandits you know like they're literally like you saw the number of arrows and everything in in the walls and the bullet holes there's no way you can stay here there's no way i would say something like maybe like knocking down one of the fences like if you did stay you could knock down like a part of the fence and rebuild it to include a garden but yeah i think it's i think we gotta go i think we gotta go

614
00:45:12,880 --> 00:46:29,570
they can't aim you're safe hey you two how are you doing we're okay just having a little spat uh-oh we all carry guns I don't like it it's the way it's got to be it is I know but I'm not getting used to it I'm sorry how are you I'm in um I think you just gotta get I think you guys just gotta get over it I think you just gotta like I don't know ma'am anyway she'll be fine you need to try harder with Lily you guys got a straightness huh actually I think I don't know how straight we can get it given all that's happened so what then time will come we'll have to do its best for our families and that's what we'll do you guys trust everyone here you guys uh trust everyone here no more or less I obviously have my problems with Lily but I don't distrust her yeah she's annoying we can't turn on each other any more than we have I don't you know she doesn't seem bad about the About the guns.

615
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,550
Don't you start.

616
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,890
I just wanted to say, Kat, it's probably good they make you uncomfortable.

617
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,110
Thank you, Lee.

618
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,550
Oh, Kenny will remember that.

619
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,370
But we need them.

620
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,150
There's no doubt about that.

621
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,570
I'll talk to you later.

622
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,050
Kenny will remember that.

623
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,170
Kenny, you need to calm down a little bit, man.

624
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:56,770
You're making me, you're making, we're bros, but like, bros will also slap some sense into each other.

625
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,410
Hi, Lee.

626
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,150
Hi.

627
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:00,970
Where's...

628
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,050
Oh, where's Duck?

629
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,430
Duck.

630
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,950
Oh, Duck.

631
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,730
Sounds like Kenny actually has that thing running.

632
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,290
He'll get over it.

633
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,790
I'll believe it when I see it.

634
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:13,810
Hello, Ben.

635
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,150
Hey, Ben.

636
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,410
What's up, Lee?

637
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,370
See anything weird?

638
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:20,910
Yeah.

639
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,210
Have you seen anything weird on watch?

640
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,070
Is there anybody out there up to anything?

641
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,990
Nope.

642
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,450
Really quiet.

643
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,550
Yeah, totally.

644
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:31,710
Which is good.

645
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:32,130
Yeah.

646
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,130
Yeah.

647
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,330
Did you ever come down to Macon much?

648
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,810
Did you ever come down here to Macon much?

649
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,330
I didn't have much reason to.

650
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,310
My parents would let me take the car into the city on the weekend.

651
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,050
But what's in Macon?

652
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:47,830
People in Macon make Macon?

653
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,690
It's kind of a waste of time compared to Atlanta.

654
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,710
I grew up in Macon.

655
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:52,050
Oh.

656
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,110
Oh.

657
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,810
I didn't mean to say it's crappy or anything.

658
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,650
It's super nice.

659
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,150
I mean, not now, but I bet it was.

660
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,070
Is.

661
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:02,930
Is.

662
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,350
Nah, we get you.

663
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,390
What do you think about Lily?

664
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,690
Hello?

665
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,390
What do you think about Lily?

666
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,530
She scares the crap out of me.

667
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,590
That's a reasonable thing to feed.

668
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,430
I'm just worried she's going to snap.

669
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,530
Talk to you later, Ben.

670
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:19,290
Bye.

671
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,270
That is a reasonable...

672
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,570
You know what?

673
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,630
That's a reasonable fear.

674
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,290
Nah, she'll get over it.

675
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,630
has a problem.

676
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,970
I miss the part when that's my problem.

677
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,410
Oh cute!

678
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,590
There's even bullet holes here.

679
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,170
That's not us, right?

680
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,530
We're moonwalking?

681
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:44,570
We're moonwalking?

682
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,770
Not again.

683
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,850
For anybody that doesn't know, I'm obsessed with that.

684
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,570
With, with bully Peter Parker.

685
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,750
When he's like, I miss the part where that's my problem.

686
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,210
I love that.

687
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,170
Bully McGuire.

688
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,310
Bully McGuire is so funny.

690
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,670
Clementine.

691
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,110
Hey, Clementine.

692
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,170
Hey, Lee.

693
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:19,850
Whatcha doing?

694
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,330
What's that you're working on, Clem?

695
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:21,890
Where's Doug?

696
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,990
It's called a leaf rubbing.

697
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,570
My teacher, Miss Moore, showed us how to do him when we went to the botanical garden once.

698
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,770
She's so smart.

699
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,670
See, it's the same.

700
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,730
Um, kind of.

701
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,330
Oh, that's really something.

702
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,170
I'll make one for you too.

703
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,690
She's so sweet.

704
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,250
She's so, she's so precious.

705
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:46,170
Oh, Clem, oh, Clementine, I love you so much.

706
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,570
Look, he's hiding in the shadows.

707
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,750
He's waiting to torment her more.

708
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,670
Do you like it here?

709
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:52,310
Do you like it here?

710
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,710
I don't like it here.

711
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,130
Yeah, so.

712
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,070
Do you want to leave?

713
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,570
Where are we going?

714
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:29,870
somewhere else I don't know maybe if I knew where yeah that'd be a good thing to know let's go to the beach later clan okay I think if we told her we're going to the beach she would be very excited okay okay what was that when there was one movie I think it was the quiet place movie talk to Lily she has a cat and no not yet I will What I wanted to say was,

715
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,530
I've been thinking a lot about you.

716
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,230
Confession?

717
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,490
I think about you too.

718
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,990
I think about you too.

719
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,630
Confession?

720
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:41,190
Confession?

721
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,690
Our group is small.

722
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:46,830
You're small.

723
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,070
Why would you say that?

724
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,390
You're a convicted killer.

725
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:52,690
Hello?

726
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,150
Carly.

727
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:53,850
Jesus.

728
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,890
And I think people should know.

729
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,690
Not because they deserve to.

730
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:26,410
and not because you're a bad man I think the opposite of those two people need to know because we're hanging by a thread here and I can't see Lily talk about you without thinking it's the next thing she's going to say you don't have to tell everyone but think about who you trust and take the opportunity while you have it me I've been stop we'll listen to her I like her you're probably right of course I'm probably right.

731
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,270
I don't think Kenny is going to like us, though.

732
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:28,810
I don't think...

733
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,950
People might be pissed, though.

734
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,830
But it will be a far cry from what will happen if they don't hear it from you.

735
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,890
Yeah, that's true.

736
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,390
Unless we kill everybody who knows.

737
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:38,530
Carly.

738
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,210
Just think.

739
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,850
This could be Doug confessing to you right now.

740
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,190
I'll let people know.

741
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,170
I'll let people know.

742
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,550
You're totally right.

743
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:49,530
Good.

744
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:50,950
I think it's for the best.

745
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:52,890
Women aren't strong.

746
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,710
Just me.

747
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,850
Don't call me small.

748
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,890
Don't call me Shirley.

749
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,890
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

750
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,970
You guys, I think we're in.

751
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,890
I think we're in.

752
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:18,970
I think we're in.

753
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,290
It should have been Doug.

754
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,690
You think people are ready to hear about me?

755
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,150
You really think people are ready to hear about me?

756
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,510
It's not a matter of ready or not.

757
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,370
She doesn't seem that small.

758
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,030
But there are going to be a lot of bad ones.

759
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,990
Why do you say that?

760
00:52:34,770 --> 00:53:05,810
seem like one of them but everyone's different who knows how each person would take it you know maybe it's worth thinking about who you want to tell she seems she's like average height completely i don't get it oh my gosh do you feel safe here show me a bath with a heated floor in a high-rise apartment and hand me a full-bodied malbec and then i'll feel safe i don't know this place is heated floors okay she's bougie i could change it any second Rizter with batteries,

761
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,530
dolly.

762
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,030
I watched a video today.

763
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:18,770
Sometimes, you know how people will travel different airlines and try their first class or their business class or whatever.

764
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,230
I watched a video today about Emirates first class.

765
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,130
Good golly, is that like actually insane?

766
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:35,790
But I learned that the bathrooms in the Emirates first class heated floors.

767
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:48,230
That seems like the most, like, it seems like the most, like the top of the top of what you could buy if you have money.

768
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,770
Like, because you don't need heated floors.

769
00:53:50,950 --> 00:54:53,470
Like, I wear slippers or socks everywhere, but like, people who have, who go through the extra effort of heated floors, it feels like the most, if you don't need it, it feels like the most bougie thing I've heard of them in my afterlife like for real Carly is 5'6 Lee is around 6'2 so she's tall for 2008 yeah what the heck then who's walking in there barefoot ah so I have no idea it's kind of scary I don't want to think about that yeah I just wear slippers everywhere but I guess if you also live in like a really like i'm not saying it's not probably a necessity everywhere you know what i mean but like if you don't need it if you're just like uh like an airplane does not need heated floors if you are you know like if you're just like ah i'm just give me my heated floors like ma'am this is Georgia.

770
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,890
It's the most like...

771
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,310
You are one state above Florida.

772
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,190
Don't act like you need that.

773
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,090
Jeez.

774
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,410
Anyway, you have any thoughts about Lily?

775
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,130
You have any thoughts about Lily?

776
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:21,410
I worry about her.

777
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,870
Back in 2012 and 13 years later.

778
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,450
She keeps trying to run things, but it's just not working.

779
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,130
I'm going to look into this thing.

780
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,070
Good idea.

781
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,510
Okay.

782
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,110
Bye, Carly.

783
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,250
Thanks for the kiss.

784
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,070
Is she in there?

785
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,130
Okay, Lily is in there.

786
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,430
I guess let's go tell.

787
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,550
You think he's going to hate me?

788
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:48,490
When I used to work on boilers, I had a customer with heated floors and Egyptian artifacts behind glass.

789
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,870
The husband worked in advertising, apparently.

790
00:55:52,890 --> 00:56:26,440

791
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,880
Haven't you...

792
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,940
No.

793
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:30,500
Yes.

794
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,460
I could use your help.

795
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,240
There's a traitor.

796
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,160
Somebody.

797
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,100
One of us.

798
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:35,700
Out there.

799
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,380
He or she or they have been taking things.

800
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,400
Uh...

801
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,400
Who?

802
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:43,800
For real.

803
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:44,500
Who?

804
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,380
What do you got?

805
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,640
Yes, for real.

806
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,860
And I don't have shit.

807
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,040
I just know.

808
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:49,920
Lily.

809
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,460
It counts often.

810
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,260
It's the good stuff.

811
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,540
Antibiotics.

812
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,140

Go look around.

Let me know if you find anything weird.

817
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,500
I feel like Duck is going to be the one to solve this.

818
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,180
I feel like Duck is going to find something.

819
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,080
Duck detective.

820
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,360
Duck will help is what it says.

821
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,480
Oh my gosh.

822
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,200
Duck detective.

Murder.

833
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,780
It's not important.

834
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,060
Oh.

835
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:09,500
Oh.

836
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,420
Just, if you hear anything, it's probably true.

01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,840
And now you know.

838
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,860

Kenny.

Kenny, you got a second?

846
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,160
I need to tell you something.

847
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,120
Can I tell them both at the same time?

848
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,740
Oh, oh, oh.

01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,300
with Larry.

856
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,340
Oh,

857
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,220
I just told her that I killed some...

858
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,500
Wait, but then she'll know that...

859
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,980
I didn't kill Larry.

860
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,220
Kenny killed Larry.

861
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,280
Oh, I don't think I should.

862
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,320
I don't think I should.

863
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,980
I think we should take the fall.

864
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,360
Tell her, you think so?

865
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,020
Okay.

866
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,580
I held Lily back, and Kenny made sure Larry didn't get up.

867
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,800
What did he do?

868
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,260
He smashed his head in.

869
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,840
I think I'm ruining their marriage.

870
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,220
I think I...

871
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,380
I think I just caused a divorce.

872
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,020
Gotcha.

873
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,580

Okay, so I wanted to come over here because she said by the ice maker, here we go, the broken glass.

879
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,030
There's some broken glass on the ground there.

880
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:51,650
Inspect it.

881
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:52,290
Oh.

882
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:52,910
Hmm.

883
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,910
Oh.

884
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,450
What is that?

885
01:06:59,770 --> 01:06:59,990
Wait.

886
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,950
There's something drawn there.

887
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:10,690
Hmm.

888
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:11,790
Chalk.

889
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,850
Oh gosh, duck!

890
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:16,910
A clue!

891
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,310
Maybe.

892
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,930
She's the only well-adjusted adult here.

893
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:20,150
What do you think it is?

894
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,030
I don't think it's anything.

895
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,130
Maybe it's a sign.

896
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:28,250
It could be.

897
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,130
It's pink chalk, which is weird.

898
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,650
Okay, back to investigating.

899
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:37,530
What is this, like, funky music side plot?

900
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:39,970
Man.

901
01:07:43,670 --> 01:08:41,230
there's no pink on the ground like that's orange yeah there's no pink definitely weird huh huh duck detective where is he sounds like Kenny actually has that thing running I believe it when I see it about the chalk hey Ben I need a piece Chuck you know where I can get any why would I have any just asking around well I don't play with that stuff I've got my well my thoughts and I've been reading the Bible I found in my room he's got his thoughts what it's there for I've been reading yeah idiot you you have that and you read it I like how we we can't even ask Carly about the X.

902
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,910
We just immediately trust her.

903
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,050
I think we're in love.

904
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,050
Have you seen any chalk around?

905
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,070
Ah, yes.

906
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,990
Clementine loves to draw with it.

907
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,310
Yeah, of course.

908
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,490
I'll talk to her.

909
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:52,150
Yeah.

910
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:53,830
Yeah.

911
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,050
Pink chalk.

912
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,330
Maybe it went missing.

913
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,690
Hey, Clementine.

914
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:01,850
It's Clementine.

915
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:04,550
Do you have any pink chalk?

916
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,290
No.

917
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,950
It's gone somewhere.

918
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:07,910
Hmm.

919
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,250
Do you want blue?

920
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,890
No, no, it's okay.

921
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,430
Wait, so whoever has the pink chalk.

922
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:12,750
Lee.

923
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,910
I found something.

924
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:19,170
What is it?

925
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:23,350
I found this piece of pink chalk and a scuff of it over by the gate.

926
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:23,790
Where?

927
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:24,490
Oh, really?

928
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,450
Totally.

929
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,710
I was coming to see him for clues.

930
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:28,770
Yeah, Duck, I got it.

931
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,650
Good job.

932
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,630
Oh, let the kid talk.

933
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:32,650
Oh, there.

934
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,410

935
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,230
Oh, he's miming?

01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,390

Just the chalk.

941
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,710
I also found some bugs underneath the stairs.

942
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:38,270
Don't tell Clementine.

943
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,810
Okay, I won't.

944
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,630
Restart the run.

945
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,030
I'm sorry.

946
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,690
I will pay for my words and my deeds.

947
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,010
You seem to know a bit about all of this.

948
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:53,950
The chalk?

949
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,650
You found the scuff here?

950
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:56,210
His eyes.

951
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,850
This is going to sound crazy, but you're not involved, are you?

Interesting.

957
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,800
It's a bag of something.

958
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:24,720
Oh.

959
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,740

960
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,160
Oh!

961
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,420
Is it full of pills?

962
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,200
Son of a bitch.

963
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:36,870
Uh-oh.

964
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:41,350
You haven't come up with anything, have you?

965
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,070
I came up with this.

966
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,950
It's got a bunch of meds in it.

967
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,910
It was in a grate on the outside wall.

968
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:50,030
And there's a sign on the other one.

969
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,330
Holy fuck.

970
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:52,630
Yeah.

971
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,110
What?

972
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,070
Okay, we line everybody up.

973
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:57,070
Everybody.

974
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,850
Somebody is killing us.

975
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:05,510
Stealing from that supply is the same as slipping into your room at night and cutting your throat while you sleep.

976
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,050
Whoa, whoa.

977
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:06,530
You die.

978
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:08,290
What is the difference?

979
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:11,470
What if Clementine gets sick and we don't have what we need?

980
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,330
What the hell like oxy?

981
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,630
You don't fucking steal from us!

982
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:19,690
Who the fuck is that?

983
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,750
Got our people out there!

984
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:22,930
Oh my god!

985
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:23,890
We're fucking around!

986
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:25,210
Not the bandits!

987
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:25,790
Shit!

988
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,570
They're gonna start kicking indoors any second.

989
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,630
Lily, what the hell are you- Wait, what?

990
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,970
Just keep them talking.

991
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,730
Do whatever it takes to stop him pulling the trigger.

992
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:37,790
You made the biggest mistake of your life!

993
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:38,250
Oh no!

994
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,550
Oh gosh, okay.

995
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,250
Okay, no pressure.

996
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,610
Enough of this bullshit!

997
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,830
Stop putting your boot to these doors.

998
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,870
Yeah.

999
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,690
Hold it, asshole.

1000
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,530
Take it easy.

1001
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,670
Yeah, his shirt says hard ass.

1002
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,410
Um, oh.

1003
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,790
We have more supplies.

1004
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,450
We can keep the deal going.

1005
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,690
Too late, shithead.

1006
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,690
We ain't giving second chances.

1007
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:02,370
What deal?

1008
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,370
It was a mix-up.

1009
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,650
We'll make it worth your while.

1010
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,270
I'm listening.

1011
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,690
Oh, oh, um, what will it...

1012
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:11,010
What will it take to reach a deal?

1013
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:11,410
Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,370
About twice as much as you've been.

1015
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,530
given us.

1016
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,250
You got it.

1017
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,710
Done.

1018
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:17,530
Is that so?

1019
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,430
Well, I suppose we ought to hash out some terms then.

1020
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,710
I don't like no hash.

1021
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:23,790
Man, shut up, bro!

1022
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:25,030
Christ!

1023
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:26,030
Oh, shit!

1024
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,490
I don't like no hash.

1025
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,290
Oh, she's got a good shot.

1026
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,750
Get him!

1027
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,430
I got him in the butt.

1028
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:37,030
Oh.

1029
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,370
Oh, no!

1030
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:40,530
Oh, no, oh, no!

1031
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,410
Get back there.

1032
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,210
Smoke him out!

1033
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,870
We got to get out of here.

1034
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:47,930
No shit.

1035
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,090
Get those bastards.

1036
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,950
Cover our people and get them to the RV.

1037
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,630
Oh, my God.

1038
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:53,630
Uh.

1039
01:14:58,910 --> 01:14:59,390
Oh.

1040
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,870
Go around, shit for brains.

1041
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,630
He's back there.

1042
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,490
Oh, wow.

1043
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,310
Nice shot me.

1044
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,010
Nice shot me.

1045
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,390
Now, get over here.

1046
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:09,750
Hurry.

1047
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,570
Man, you saved our assets.

1048
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:12,750
Get inside.

1049
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,250
Time crisis.

1050
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:15,930
Cloud!

1051
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,830
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1052
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,070
Gotcha, hang on!

1053
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,670
And there's zombies!

1054
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,570
Where is he?

1055
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:27,210
Oh my gosh.

1056
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:35,300
Gotcha!

1057
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:36,600
Hurry, come on!

1058
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,480
Clip, get inside the RV.

1059
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,860
It's gonna be okay, go!

1060
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,640
Oh my god.

1061
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,200
Oh Christ.

1062
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,700
Lily, get in the RV.

1063
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,480
Screw her.

1064
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,340
Let her stay.

1065
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,300
Lily!

1066
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:57,760
Shit!

1067
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:02,970
Well, I have to do this now.

1068
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,020
A or D?

1069
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:08,620
Oh, okay.

1070
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:09,000
Oh, okay.

1071
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:09,720
Oh, shoot.

1072
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:11,780
Okay.

1073
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:14,230
Other side?

1074
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:14,970
Oh, gosh.

1075
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:15,310
Okay.

1076
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,730
How long do I have to do this?

1077
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,260
Oh, my goodness.

1078
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:28,980
Last chance.

1079
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,840
Get down here.

1080
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,360
Free earth foot licker.

1081
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,820
Thank you so much for the What was

1082
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:43,810
the point of me shooting at them?

1083
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:44,510
Jesus, are you okay?

1084
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:45,610
I'm fine.

1085
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,470
I'm fine.

1086
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:48,730
Duck is not looking so good.

1087
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:50,810
I'm sorry.

1088
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:51,690
Everything's fine.

1089
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,950
Everything's not fine.

1090
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:53,790
Ben.

1091
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,850
You need to figure out how this happened.

1092
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,250
Ben.

1093
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,530
You just lost everything.

1094
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:57,990
Ben.

1095
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,430
Well, we're lucky as shit to have this RV.

1096
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,590
And nobody died.

1097
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,130
Cat's head is split open.

1098
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:02,490
I'm fine.

1099
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:03,450
Duck is...

1100
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,530
Duck's eyes are rolling into the back of his head.

1101
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,570
The bandits have had our number for weeks.

1102
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,730
This is different.

1103
01:17:09,570 --> 01:18:13,510

1106
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:39,470
Voting duck.

1107
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,290
Will we lay off of him?

1108
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:42,210
I...

1109
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,610
Oh shit!

1110
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:44,870
What's going on up there?

1111
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:46,230
I hit something.

1112
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,330
We gotta stop.

1113
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,090
Oh.

1114
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:50,610
Well, we can deal with this now then.

1115
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,650
Oh my god!

1116
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,170
What do you mean you hit something?

1117
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,550
Kitty, is it safe?

1118
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:58,550
Should be.

1119
01:18:58,910 --> 01:18:59,670
Everybody out.

1120
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:00,910
Think we know what you hit?

1121
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:01,470
Out.

1122
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,090
Oh, good.

1123
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,210
Right next to another car, though.

1124
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,150
There might be supplies.

1125
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,240
Ew, you can hear it.

1126
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,630
Ew, you can hear it.

1127
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:19,110
Kenny, you have, like, one job.

1128
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:28,450
Kenny, the RV has some surface damage, but there's a walker trapped underneath.

1129
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:31,770
God damn it.

1130
01:19:32,390 --> 01:20:03,370

1131
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,370
Okay, fine then.

1132
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,070
Why do I think that?

1133
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:06,470
Kenny?

1134
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,150
I don't know.

1135
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:08,690
Fuck.

1136
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,290
Just stop, would you?

1137
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:12,810
Well, your vote counts for you and Kacha.

1138
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,050
We don't need all these votes.

1139
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,250
You said to vote!

1140
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:17,250
Trust me.

1141
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,110
I'll do anything.

1142
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,570
I'll do watches for months.

1143
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:20,810
Huh.

1144
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,210
The hell you will.

1145
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,350
I'll get more food.

1146
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:24,210
More medicine.

1147
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:24,970
Anything.

1148
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,290
You think any of that is good now?

1149
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,210
Just let me stay, please.

1150
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:30,470
God, please.

1151
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:31,410
You have better.

1152
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,390
It was your idea to vote.

1153
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:32,990
Look at you.

1154
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,570
Okay, you're making it worse, man.

1155
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:35,490
You're making it worse on yourself.

1156
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,150
I just don't want to be on my own.

1157
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,410
You should have thought of that.

1158
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,790
Do we need any more evidence than this?

1159
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:43,670
Fuck evidence.

1160
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,250
Stop treating him like this.

1161
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,970
Shut up, Connie.

1162
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,710
Wait a second, though.

1163
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,230
I've heard enough out of you.

1164
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,290
Kenny, what's it going to be?

1165
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:52,130
Just give me a damn minute.

1166
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:57,850
Then, you have until that Walker is dealt with to tell me it was her and not you.

1167
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,650
Stop this.

1168
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,730
You're torturing him.

1169
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,210
No!

1170
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,970
This is about trust, and I've never trusted you.

1171
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,550
Lily, are you off?

1172
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,370
I can't, Lee.

1173
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,130
You know I can't.

1174
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:10,850
Thank you, Lee.

1175
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:12,450
Please, listen to him.

1176
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,090
Please don't kick me out of the group.

1177
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:15,010
We won't.

1178
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:15,630
Tell me.

1179
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:16,810
Now.

1180
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,970
Why doesn't she think it was Kenny?

1181
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,110
I've got him, he's.

1182
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,710
Let's just get back in the RV.

1183
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,150
You think you're some tough bitch, don't you?

1184
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,330
Like nothing can hurt you.

1185
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,070
But you're just a scared little girl.

1186
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,570
Get the fuck over it.

1187
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:31,390
Take a page from Lee's book and try helping somebody.

1188
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:45,610

What are we gonna do with her?

1192
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,420
Leave her for the walkers.

1193
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,860
You're not coming with us.

1194
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,120
I'll die out here.

1195
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,380
No, yeah, we leave her.

1196
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,460
You're a murderer, Lily.

1197
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:25,740
We can't have you with us.

1198
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,740
I'm a murderer.

1199
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,420
You've had Lee with you this whole time.

1200
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,820
I don't care what he did before.

1201
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,940
If we keep you with us, how long until you get me?

1202
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,880
I was trying to protect all of us.

1203
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,720
I don't have anything left.

1204
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,580
Get in, Lee.

1205
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,200
Let's go, you guys.

1206
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,260
Girl, you can't be acting like the victim right now.

1207
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,520
I suppose they should get over it.

1208
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,240
She's acting like the victim.

1209
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:59,990
You resorted to the worst thing.

1210
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,110
Lily.

1211
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:05,230
Lily.

1212
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:06,470
Lily.

1213
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:36,790

1216
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,600
Duck is bitten.

1217
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:08,520
Huh?

1218
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:12,040
He got bit by a walker trying to escape the motel.

1219
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,400
I was too slow.

1220
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,780
I don't feel good.

1221
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,260
Clem?

1222
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,220
Clem, don't say that.

1223
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,140
What about Carly?

1224
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,460
Gone, but won't come back.

1225
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,040
Because she was shot in the head.

1226
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:29,360
That's right.

1227
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,440
Yeah, it is.

1228
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:33,780
It is.

1229
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:34,740
If

1230
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,220
we had saved Doug.

1231
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,120
I'm glad I have you.

1232
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,460
Me too.

1233
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:58,060
I heard you outside my treehouse that day and thought about dropping a hammer on your head.

1234
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:58,840
Good girl.

1235
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,280
That's nice.

1236
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,360
That's nice.

1237
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,360
I didn't though.

1238
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,340
She's she's protecting herself.

1239
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,780
Yeah, good instincts, exactly.

1240
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:21,160
Banana.

1241
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,040
Oh, God.

1242
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,580
Wait, what?

1243
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,460
This is a dream.

1244
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,220
This is a dream.

1245
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:34,800
This is a dream.

1246
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:35,660
This is a dream.

1247
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:36,920
This is a dream.

1248
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:37,320
Okay.

1249
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,580
I knew it.

1250
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,500
I knew it.

1251
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,740
We got something up ahead.

1252
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,020
I knew it.

1253
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,900
I knew it.

1254
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,260
It's okay.

1255
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,020
We're fine.

1256
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,780
Wait, but he still hasn't turned?

1257
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:04,220
They really tried to redeem Duck with the cute little detective thing, and then they killed him.

1258
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,600
That's crazy!

1259
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,740
They were like, yo, you...

1260
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,220
You know, Duck's been annoying this whole time, but he's actually quite cute.

1261
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,280
Oh my gosh.

1262
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,520
Is there any way to get around it?

1263
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,860
Doesn't look like it.

1264
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,200
On foot, maybe.

1265
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,080
Can't really afford to do that now.

1266
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,580
I guess it was like a kind of a death flag in its own way.

1267
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,780
This seems like a safe area.

1268
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,140
Well, this brush will stop anything from creeping up on us.

1269
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:38,620
What?

1270
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,270
Oh!

1271
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,720
Why don't you and I go look around?

1272
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,320
Yeah, everyone else relax.

1273
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,120
Clem, stay close to Kinney and Cat, okay?

1274
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:54,780
But not Duck.

1275
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,160
Lee, if you come across anything to drink, if there's a dining car or something, I think Duck's a bit dehydrated.

1276
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,780
It's a freighter, huh?

1277
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,500
Be careful in there.

1278
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:05,600
What?

1279
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,300
You think there might be something dangerous inside an abandoned locomotive?

1280
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,340
Hadn't crossed my mind.

1281
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:43,660
okay exciting train box car ladder we'll talk to Ben I think duck is dead I think so yeah duck is thirsty for blood was it you was it you not this again I'm just asking no okay then I don't know I feel like Ben won't forget that.

1282
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,400
Don't worry, Minto, the protagonist.

1283
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,500
Ben is still alive.

1284
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,080
Happy you stayed with us all this time.

1285
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,320
What would you have done with Lily?

1286
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,440
I don't know.

1287
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,560
Left her?

1288
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,360
I've never seen anybody kill someone like that before.

1289
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,920
You've seen a bunch of other stuff by now.

1290
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,200
Yeah, but not like that.

1291
01:29:11,420 --> 01:30:15,120

1292
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:24,680
Has Clementine said anything to you about Connie and Duck or anything?

1293
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,860
I'm worried about her.

1294
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:30,480
No.

1295
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,540
That little girl is a puzzle.

1296
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,440
Yeah, she is.

1297
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,060
She's a poor Carly.

1298
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,820
She's not a puzzle.

1299
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,640
God, where did yesterday go?

1300
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,420
I know.

1301
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,340
My gosh.

1302
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,920
I don't know.

1303
01:30:44,780 --> 01:31:17,840

1304
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,380
Please do not let him solely our good name

1305
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:35,940
Uh-oh Seems like all the Ben's need to vote a Ben out Benjamin Would you have left Lily back there on the side of the road like that?

1306
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,680
Yes, Lee.

1307
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:40,480
Yeah We have to have lines.

1308
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,440
Yes, I would have left her.

1309
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,720
That's very true If Katya says it's okay, then I think it's okay.

1310
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,960
Let me know if anything changes here.

1311
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,940
She's probably the best moral compass here.

1312
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:53,660
Oh, wait.

1313
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,440
Kani.

1314
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,960
Oh, wait, I did talk to Kani.

1315
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,420
Still looking around and haven't figured much out yet.

1316
01:31:58,860 --> 01:31:59,300
It's fine.

1317
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,300
Radiator could use a rest as it is.

1318
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,280
Sorry, I forgot Kani didn't have anything to say.

1319
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,940
Okay, let's go check out the car.

1320
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,420
Wait, should I go inside?

1321
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:09,680
It's kind of scary.

1322
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,480
But what if Lily was right?

1323
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,480
that it was Carly?

1324
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:17,880
I don't know.

1325
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,820
Anybody in here?

1326
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,360
Oh gosh, the whimsy music stopped.

1327
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,640
Oh no, scary music started.

1328
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,560
Oh, this place looks...

1329
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:33,940
Yeah, it's us.

1330
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:34,480
Yeah, man.

1331
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,600
Shit, think they're gone?

1332
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:40,080
I hope so, but this looks recently used.

1333
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,180
Be on the lookout and have you gone.

1334
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,640
It smells recently used.

1335
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,920
We changed Ben's name to Shirley.

1336
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,340
Looks unopened.

1337
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,680
Um, okay.

1338
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,920
I'll take this to Katja for Dutch.

1339
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,400
Oh, that's right.

1340
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:56,920
He's thirsty.

1341
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,540
Look at the map.

1342
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,360
A clipboard.

1343
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,480
A map of where the train goes.

1344
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,880
I think these tracks might lead to the coast.

1345
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:11,460
Oh!

1346
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,260
27 Savannah.

1347
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,180
That's where Kenny's got us headed.

1348
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,060
Okay, nice.

1349
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:20,960
Yikes, this mattress.

1350
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:23,560
Okay.

1351
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,520
The frog magazine?

1352
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,040
I thought it was dog food.

1353
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:36,210
Okay, okay.

1354
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,890
I was like, can I do anything here?

1355
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:40,630
Engine compartment.

1356
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:42,070
Might be something inside.

1357
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:43,010
Okay.

1358
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,090
Ozombo.

1359
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:46,550
I'm ready?

1360
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:48,190
Oh, okay, never mind.

1361
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:51,430
Uh.

1362
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,830
Switch.

1363
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,570
Nintendo.

1364
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:57,830
Frog food.

1365
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:00,770
Is there a zombo in here?

1366
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,620
Okay, we got some spike removers.

1367
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,220
I'll take that.

1368
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,520
Bintendo.

1369
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,400
A minkey wrench.

1370
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,720
I'll take that.

1371
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,480
Just kidding, I can only have one.

1372
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,400
Okay, we'll just hold on to it for now.

1373
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:29,900
now.

1374
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:30,960
Minky!

1375
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,580
Might be something inside.

1376
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:34,980
There we go.

1377
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:43,700
Nuh-uh.

1378
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,200
Time to build a water park.

1379
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:50,700
Yahoo!

1380
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:04,270
This seems like it's going to be a pain in the butt because we have to open the doors and do the cuts.

1381
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:07,690
If I have to open doors multiple times, it's going to be kind of annoying.

1382
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:09,990
Oh, that's...

1383
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,410
Shit.

1384
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,570
It's shot in the head.

1385
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:14,990
I think it's okay.

1386
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:15,450
We got one.

1387
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,750
No, no, I think it's...

1388
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,550
Sitting in the chair.

1389
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,110
No, it's head.

1390
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:19,970
Oh.

1391
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,270
Is he alive?

1392
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:25,350
Use monkey wrench.

1393
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,370
Is it awake?

1394
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:29,090
Maybe not.

1395
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:38,490
A sitter.

1396
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,970
Yeah, he's not doing anything.

1397
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,050
That guy's dead dead.

1398
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,590
Suppose we all look him over.

1399
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:47,710
Oh.

1400
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,150
Examine him.

1401
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:06,220
Oh, is little of the photo of his family?

1402
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:09,260
I don't think this guy came back.

1403
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,160
Oh.

1404
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,280
That light is blinking.

1405
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,080
Push it.

1406
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:16,880
Push it.

1407
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:17,660
Why not?

1408
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,120
Are you fucking serious?

1409
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,180
Here, look.

1410
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,420
Oh, Ben!

1411
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:22,280
Ben!

1412
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:22,800
Ben!

1413
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,400
It's just the brakes.

1414
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,180
Okay, I'll give you that one.

1415
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:30,400
This fucker works?

1416
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,100
Seems like it.

1417
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:32,940
Oh my goodness.

1418
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,080
How the hell do we get it moving?

1419
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:35,840
Explosion button.

1420
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,700
I don't know.

1421
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,500
That's Mr. Amtrak over here.

1422
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:39,760
No clue.

1423
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:42,920
We found this in the box car back there.

1424
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:43,280
Yeah.

1425
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,640
Whoa, is this what it looks like?

1426
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:45,820
I think so.

1427
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,060
This horse will take us right to Savannah.

1428
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,720
A hundred tons of steel.

1429
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,720
Put a thousand walkers between us and the ocean, and we don't have to give a shit.

1430
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,420
That's true.

1431
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,440
I can't believe it.

1432
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,940
Uh, I wouldn't, yeah.

1433
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,100
I wouldn't mind plowing through some walkers.

1434
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:01,800
Hell yeah.

1435
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,060
That's the spirit.

1436
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,540
Try to get this thing started.

1437
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,020
There's gotta be some sort of manual or something.

1438
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,520
Huh, I don't know about that.

1439
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,360
The nuke button for the train.

1440
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,720
Man, if you could keep an eye on the girls and duck, I'd appreciate it.

1441
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:15,440
I won't make sense of these controls.

1442
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,820
Someone should have played train simulator.

1443
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,380
Man, this could be exactly what we need.

1444
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:23,840
Yeah.

1445
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:25,720
Yeah.

1446
01:37:26,460 --> 01:38:12,600
hey kid what's up no Ben that's the blow up the whole train button every train has one every train has one because who knows if he need to I don't know about leaving Lily back there now I knew abandoning someone on the side of the room it's the same as murder don't worry about it we just would have had to deal with her eventually you want to talk about duck you want to talk about duck why did i slide in nobody deserves this there's nothing to talk about you heard cat he could be fine we probably shouldn't ignore it nobody's ignoring nothing i'm not worried you shouldn't be either

1447
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:35,110
yeah yeah we needed something to help us god we need some help getting this train going people take notes right when working on stuff like this We're smart guys, we can figure it out.

1448
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:37,410
Yeah, okay.

1449
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,530
I'll get back to it.

1450
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:39,230
Me too.

1451
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,110
Oh, there's that.

1452
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:42,130
The map bin.

1453
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,410
A bunch of maps about Georgia's cities.

1454
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:46,910
Nothing about the tree.

1455
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,770
Oh, that's a picture.

1456
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,390
Look at this boat.

1457
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:53,470
Oh, here we go.

1458
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,390
Shit, this is it.

1459
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,270
Instructions on starting the engine.

1460
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:57,390
Engines.

1461
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:57,810
Damn.

1462
01:38:58,490 --> 01:38:59,010
Pages are gone.

1463
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,270
No, how convenient.

1464
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,010
I can kind of see the engine.

1465
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:02,370
The Rizzler?

1466
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,110
Wait!

1467
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:04,990
Clem!

1468
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,730
Find a way to read the notebook.

1469
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:08,990
We gotta talk to Clementine.

1470
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:13,330
She knows the leaf rubbing.

1471
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,410
Okay.

1472
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:22,350
Give me down.

1473
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:25,110
And let's go give the water bottle to...

1474
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:28,270
Do you think I should put a little drop of blood in there?

1475
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:29,810
For... for, uh...

1476
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:30,230
For duck?

1477
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:32,850
You think it was?

1478
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,530
You think get his palette ready?

1479
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:42,130
We found a notebook that we think might have had some starter directions on it, but the page is missing.

1480
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:43,090
Some sugar.

1481
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,770
I'm sure you guys will figure it out.

1482
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:46,150
Hey, you too.

1483
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:49,930
There's a notepad on the train.

1484
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:52,110
Do you have any pencils or anything in your pack?

1485
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:54,250
No, I wish.

1486
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,010
Maybe in the RV.

1487
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:57,590
What do you need it for?

1488
01:39:57,990 --> 01:40:00,930
There used to be something written on the notepad that I need to know about.

1489
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:03,090
Well, if you're not using it, I'd take it.

1490
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:07,010
I'm out of paper and there's all sorts of new leaves around here.

1491
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:13,110
She wants some leaves.

1492
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:13,530
Okay.

1493
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,650
Here, found some water.

1494
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:17,930
Oh, thank you.

1495
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:18,490
Perfect.

1496
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:21,070
He's allergic to bees.

1497
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,170
Is that right?

1498
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:24,070
It's all I can keep thinking about.

1499
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:26,590
Like, somehow that matters.

1500
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,890
He doesn't.

1501
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:28,690
He doesn't look good.

1502
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,370
I know.

1503
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,650
Well, I don't.

1504
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:32,010
But you're probably right.

1505
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:38,530
oh he's also allergic to zombies

1506
01:40:43,360 --> 01:41:39,420

1507
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,040
Okay, what about that banana drink?

1508
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:42,960
Can I try that?

1509
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:43,680
Oh, yeah.

1510
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,020
Let me see the banana.

1511
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,340
Banana.

1512
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,620
Oh, I'm trapped.

1513
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,460
Okay, there we go.

1514
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:53,800
Glenn died?

1515
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,000
OMG spoilers.

1516
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,200
Sorry.

1517
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,120
Use it.

1518
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,680
Just eating Mike Tyson's ass.

1519
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,520
Thank you for the super- Ah, Taco!

1520
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,940
to see what I said, though.

1521
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,640
I'm sorry.

1522
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,520
Banana drink is a recurring joke in Telltale games.

1523
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:23,140
Oh, is it?

1524
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:23,860
That's fun.

1525
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,140
Alright.

1526
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,000
Perfect.

1527
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:30,600
You can read it now?

1528
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:31,260
Yeah.

1529
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,120
Should be able to just follow the steps to get the engine on.

1530
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,400
Sounds good.

1531
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:43,270
Six, five, nine, nine.

1532
01:42:44,170 --> 01:43:07,250
Okay, I'm guessing that's like the the door I think we got this wait which door never mind I don't I have no idea wait

Oh, oh, use notepad!

1536
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:53,970
Okay, here we go.

1537
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:54,430
Okay.

1538
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:55,890
Down, down.

1539
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:02,190
Down, down, and this was like...

1540
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:02,430
Oh.

1541
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:03,590
Up, up.

1542
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:06,550
Up.

1543
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,710
Up.

1544
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:12,310
And then...

1545
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:15,310
Up, down, up.

1546
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:17,470
Up.

1547
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:20,550
Down.

1548
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:25,120
Oh.

1549
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,200
Son of a bitch.

1550
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,220
Whatever you did, let the dash up.

1551
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:28,760
Let's go.

1552
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:29,820
So far so good.

1553
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:30,980
Konamiko, yeah.

1554
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:37,510
Alright, use notepad.

1555
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:38,770
It was five.

1556
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:39,390
Okay, so.

1557
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:42,190
Horizontal vertical.

1558
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,480
There we go.

1559
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:48,520
Horizontal.

1560
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,320
Now we're talking.

1561
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,380
Okay, easy.

1562
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,780
Alright, and then it was nine, nine.

1563
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,760
Which, maybe, look it right at lunch.

1564
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:57,940
Ew.

1565
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:58,780
Ew.

1566
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,800
Maybe nine is out here.

1567
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,360
Okay.

1568
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:12,080
Um, it was like, there was one of these.

1569
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,100
Was it this one?

1570
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:19,520
Nine!

1571
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:20,100
Okay.

1572
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,820
Uh, one to the left, one to the right.

1573
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,300
Okay.

1574
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:29,400
Left.

1575
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,630
One to the right.

1576
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:37,530
Yahoo!

1577
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:42,410
Holy shit.

1578
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,390
We're golden.

1579
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:47,090
Yeah, we...

1580
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:47,870
This thing is loud.

1581
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:50,350
So what?

1582
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:52,790
We're barreling down the tracks at 40 miles an hour.

1583
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:54,310
I don't care about the noise.

1584
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:55,630
I mean, but...

1585
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:56,570
Let's fucking enjoy this.

1586
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:58,070
We can't have too many zombies.

1587
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,510
They'll clock it up.

1588
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,770
They'll clock it up.

1589
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:03,470
Should I

1590
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:08,680
follow you?

1591
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,840
It's all yours.

1592
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:13,380
Me?

1593
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,080
I get to do the honors?

1594
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,880
Look at throttle.

1595
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,420
That's the throttle.

1596
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:21,240
That's the throttle.

1597
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:23,960
Does it work?

1598
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,900

1615
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,280
It didn't matter.

1616
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:32,520

Why don't we hold off on stay with us?

1632

I'll be up front.

1639
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,750
I don't want to hear any nonsense until we get where we're going.

1640
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:16,540
Maybe he's car-sick.

1641
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,880
He's just feeling a little motion-sick.

1642
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:20,040
That's why he's turning green.

1643
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,020
Candy, don't be like this.

1644
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,420
Okay, I'm going to full throttle.

1645
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,860
Maybe he swallowed a beat.

1646
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,160
He's allergic.

1647
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:34,880
Oh, no!

1648
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,840
Ah, nice and slow.

1649
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,800
40 miles per hour.

1650
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,680
This will definitely take care of anybody.

1651
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,400
Any zombies.

1652
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,900
Just talking about Outer Wilds with my friend earlier on.

1653
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:50,480
I love Outer Wilds.

1654
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:51,940
I love, love, love.

1655
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,280
Oh my god, not the gaunt.

1656
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:00,340
His face is all sunken in.

1657
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:06,100
Ew, that guy is missing an arm.

1658
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:19,740
I wish I could play Outer Wilds again for the first time.

1659
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:25,720
That's me in the morning.

1660
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:29,280
Three adults, taking care of three kids.

1661
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:31,580
No disrespect, son.

1662
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,260
Well, there were more of us.

1663
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:39,980
Dead, get them.

1664
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:42,200
Yeah, something like that.

1665
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:44,120
Oh, well, yes?

1666
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,240
Uh, yes.

1667
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:45,820
Yes.

1668
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:48,780
No, it's a shame.

1669
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:50,260
Lee.

1670
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,340
Lee, I need you right now.

1671
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,900
I need you to go get Ken.

1672
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,000
Would you get that off his face?

1673
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,640
My hands are full here.

1674
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,540
He's gonna bite me.

1675
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:00,600
He's gonna bite me.

1676
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:02,240
He's gonna bite me if I do that.

1677
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:03,620
Oh my god.

1678
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:04,720
Thank you.

1679
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,340
Could you just get that off his face, please?

1680
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:10,860
Clean duck.

1681
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,260
Oh my god.

1682
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,120
Oh my god.

1683
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,690
He's out of time.

1684
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:20,450
We need to stop this train.

1685
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:22,570
Or you could just throw him off.

1686
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:28,380
Oh, Clementine.

1687
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:29,560
I'm going to go get Kitty.

1688
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:32,060
Hold on tight in case the train stops fast.

1689
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,260
I'll get this train stopped right quick.

1690
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,520
Yeah, I am.

1691
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:41,980
Stopping the train.

1692
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:43,260
Stay put.

1693
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:44,980
Okay.

1694
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:49,100
Why is he so grumpy?

1695
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:52,480
Is he so grumpy because...

1696
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,580
Oh, I got to go the other way.

1697
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:53,980
That's right.

1698

Don't make me fucking regret it.

1703
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:45,960
That's true.

1704
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,060
That's very true Hey, man.

1705
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:49,860
Come on.

1706
01:57:53,030 --> 01:58:02,570
You want to hurt people because you're afraid losing duck ain't enough for you because you're fucking lose everything acting like this I'll fucking kill you before I let that happen.

1707
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:04,530
Oh my god.

1708
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:06,570
Oh my god.

1709
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,180
I'm sorry.

1710
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,560
I'm sorry.

1711
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,780
I'm sorry.

1712
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:19,480
Please forgive me for choking you out.

1713
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:22,640
I knocked some sense into Kenny.

1714
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,640
We did it!

1715
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:34,560
I'm sorry.

1716
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,200
I'm sorry your son died.

1717
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:43,980
27th birthday to JP release the Metal Gear Solid 1 Thank You Akira!

1718
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:44,680
Yeah!

1719
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:51,340
We don't...

1720
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,040
Again, it's... I think it's time.

1721
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:58,200
Oh, he doesn't sound very good.

1722
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:00,760
Oh, Mr. Duck Detective.

1723
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,560
The boy's been bit.

1724
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,400
In case you haven't figured that out.

1725
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:11,520
Oh, uh, what do you need?

1726
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,080
What do you need?

1727
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:14,340
I...

1728
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:15,420
I...

1729
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:15,840
I...

1730
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,000
Gotcha.

1731
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,540
It's time to...

1732
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,920
This is not possible.

1733
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,160
What are we gonna do?

1734
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,560
Our little duck detective!

1735
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,580
We can't allow him to become one of those things.

1736
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:33,160
But what if... what if he doesn't?

1737
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,580
Kenny, I love you very much.

1738
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,020
I love our son more than life itself.

1739
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,620
I need you to hear me.

1740
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:45,500
What you are saying, that he may not turn, is foolish.

1741
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:46,440
But...

1742
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:46,740
No.

1743
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:50,820
There's...

1744
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:52,000
Come on, cat.

1745
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,360
If you think of one, you let me know.

1746
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,940
Isn't there some sort of pill or something we can just give him?

1747
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:58,420
Stop it.

1748
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:00,780
Just drift off to sleep, right, hun?

1749
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,580
I mean, Jesus, this is our son.

1750
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:07,840
I know, but we know it's here or nothing.

1751
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,260
That's true, that's true.

1752
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,080
Just who, then?

1753
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:12,380
You want me to?

1754
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,320
You don't have to.

1755
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:14,860
I'll do it.

1756
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:15,180
No.

1757
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:16,880
You don't have to.

1758
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,160
God, you're fucked.

1759
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:19,940
I can.

1760
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,700
I can do this.

1761
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:22,920
I'll do it.

1762
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,260
No, it should be apparent.

1763
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,600
They will remember that.

1764
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:27,740
You'll be able to do something like this.

1765
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:29,940
Lee's right, Kat.

1766
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:33,720
We can say our goodbyes and just let that be it.

1767
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,920
I'll old yell at him.

1768
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:35,900
Don't worry.

1769
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:39,240
Lee, you'd be doing this family a great service.

1770
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,300
Why don't we take him into the forest so Clementine doesn't have to see?

1771
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:46,960
Yeah.

1772
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:50,060
Give us a moment to say goodbye.

1773
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:50,940
Of course.

1774
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,380
Okay, but be fast because he's sound like he's about to start.

1775
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,660
You know.

1776
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:09,700
You would think that the train sounds would attract zombies, but maybe they're not out this far.

1777
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,400
Except duck.

1778
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:19,050
What's happening?

1779
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:19,730
Oh.

1780
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:23,130
Oh, Clem.

1781
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:23,570
Oh.

1782
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:30,510
Duck is dying.

1783
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,730
I think we should be honest with her.

1784
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:32,230
I know.

1785
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:37,010
But we don't need to tell her that we're the one handling it.

1786
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:37,410
What are you doing?

1787
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:44,770
Going to make sure he's okay.

1788
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:47,170
In a sense.

1789
02:01:47,290 --> 02:01:48,610
I'm going to make sure he's okay.

1790
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:49,350
Yeah.

1791
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,610
But how?

1792
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:51,890
He's bitten.

1793
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:55,790
I'm making sure he doesn't come back.

1794
02:01:56,190 --> 02:01:57,630
Oh, she'll remember my honesty.

1795
02:01:58,510 --> 02:01:59,030
Look, Clem.

1796
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,490
Things are...

1797
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:00,970
What the?

1798
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:01,570
No!

1799
02:02:02,110 --> 02:02:03,970
Finn, take Clementine into the train.

1800
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:04,490
Go.

1801
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:05,530
It'll be fine.

1802
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,610
What?

1803
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,720
Why did they take him out so far?

1804
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:16,440
Oh, my gosh.

1805
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:17,720
We're, like, really running in.

1806
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:26,240
Gotcha!

1807
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,160
Cat, cat, gotcha.

1808
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:31,900
What?

1809
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:37,100
Why?

1810
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:37,740
Cat.

1811
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:39,200
Oh, hi.

1812
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,060
Oh, fucking God.

1813
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:48,450
I don't even...

1814
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:49,130
Oh, my God.

1815
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:51,190
Oh, my God.

1816
02:02:52,870 --> 02:02:53,870
I...

1817
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:55,270
I...

1818
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:57,670
Oh, Cat.

1819
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,200
Oh.

1820
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:13,180
Oh.

1821
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:24,510
Oh my gosh, we've lost so many people this chapter.

1822
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:25,590
What the heck?

1823
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:26,570
What do we do?

1824
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:29,070
Oh.

1825
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:32,430
Give me the gun, kid.

1826
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,610
I'll do it.

1827
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:37,350
Oh, Kenny.

1828
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:49,130
Oh, Kenny.

1829
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,590
Oh, Kenny.

1830
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:52,570
Oh, why are they really making me do it?

1831
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:53,570
It's no good.

1832
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:55,990
I can't do it.

1833
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,410
Oh, duck.

1834
02:03:59,490 --> 02:04:00,450
Oh, duck.

1835
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:00,890
Oh, duck.

1836
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:04,070
It's just like...

1837
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:04,430
Oh gosh.

1838
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:10,290
It's just like Metal Gear.

1839
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:15,430
I'm gonna be doing this again in Delta!

1840
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:17,950
No!

1841
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:25,320
Duck Detective.

1842
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:03,060
That was so bad.

1843
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,160
That was actually just so bad.

1844
02:05:13,700 --> 02:06:31,300
this whole chapter you understand what happened yes oh okay what are you thinking about what chuck said what chucks say that what happened to duck would happen to me what the fuck he did swear sorry i'm gonna go talk some sense into it don't be mad why did he say that um excuse me hey hey how you doing um why did you say what you said to Clementine I don't care what reasons you had for doing it no reason to go and tell my girl she's gonna end up dead because she is I don't know much about you folks but I can tell you as sure as the Sun's gonna come up tomorrow but y'all keep going on like this and that girl ain't gonna make it what do you know I know that you don't have a goddamn plan we get to Savannah and then what I don't know uh we we do what's best for clementine best for clementine oh well then you do have it all chuck doesn't like that mind look sit down with the girl and hash it out find a map for christ's sake i'd give you one if i had it and if something were to happen oh but

1845
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:45,660
you had a plan just chilling in the train if it were you gotta prepare the girl teach her to use a weapon and for crime and he cut that hair what's wrong with her hair She's a little girl.

1846
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,520
She's a little girl.

1847
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:49,840
And she'll die a little girl if you treat her like one.

1848
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:50,540
Okay, that's better.

1849
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:53,080
You gotta consider her a living person.

1850
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,740
That's it.

1851
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:55,600
You're either living or you're not.

1852
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:57,760
You ain't little, you ain't a girl, you ain't a boy.

1853
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,120
You ain't strong or smart.

1854
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:01,720
You're alive.

1855
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:03,280
Look at her hair.

1856
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:08,840
You gotta run around with a mop that's gonna act like Velcro to any hand swinging its way.

1857
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:13,680
Find some scissors in my pack and take care of that hair before Walker does it for you.

1858
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:45,800
my god and then i know he has a good point but it makes me upset that's what saves your life from here on now he has a point but it makes me bad i don't mean to tell you how to do your job but too many people have died already that's so true they have yeah and seeing another little girl die might just do me in i hear you a plan a haircut and a gun it's good advice it is yeah push him off no you have any family Out there somewhere.

1859
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:50,860
Been sort of on my own for the past little 14 years.

1860
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:51,880
14 years.

1861
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:52,700
Sorry to hear that.

1862
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:55,820
No one to blame What yourself?

You're homeless, then?

Suppose I've had homes here and there and They just don't work out.

02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:21,940
It's still the best plan.

1874
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:22,600
Yeah.

1875
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:24,760
It's the best plan.

1876
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,380
It's the best plan.

1877
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,040
Carly.

1878
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,780
I wonder if I get by you for a second, Kitty.

1879
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,680
Can you just leave me alone?

1880
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:36,460
I want to see the map, please.

1881
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:37,940
Just a second.

1882
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:38,720
Yeah.

1883
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:41,880
Are there any maps in here?

1884
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,080
Are there any maps up here?

1885
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:44,580
I don't know.

1886
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:49,920
I just want to look over one with Clem, so she has a lay of the land once we get to Savannah.

1887
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,020
Wait, please.

1888
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,840
Please, Kenny, please.

1889
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:56,420
You mind if I'm looking there for a second?

1890
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:59,160
I really wish you'd just leave me alone.

1891
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,300
I just gotta reach over your shoulder.

1892
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:02,300
Don't worry about it.

1893
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:03,060
Get out of here.

1894
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:04,720
Just one second.

1895
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,340
What's your problem?

1896
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:12,120
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, just reach that for me, bro.

1897
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,680
If I could buy you for a second, Kenny.

1898
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:41,320

1899
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,900
Yeah, you're going to be able to step up?

1900
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:47,540
Are you going to be able to step up?

1901
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:49,560
I can do just as much as anyone else.

1902
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:50,160
Okay.

1903
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:50,860
Good.

1904
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:51,840
I hope that's true.

1905
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:52,080
Yeah.

1906
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,180
Yeah.

1907
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:54,980
I was thinking that.

1908
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,700
I was just like, he hasn't done anything.

1909
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:00,040
Like, this guy has been completely useless.

1910
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:03,200
Carly didn't have to die, you know.

1911
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,080
She would have killed me instead.

1912
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:06,860
Carly?

1913
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,680
Yeah, maybe.

1914
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:09,000
See you.

1915
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,300
I don't think Carly...

1916
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:10,740
Yeah.

1917
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:12,440
I don't think Carly would have killed you.

1918
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:13,540
What are you talking about?

1919
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,420
Oh my god.

1920
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:26,880
He means Lily.

1921
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:30,000
Oh, Lily, oh, I was just like, why are you talking?

1922
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:32,080
Oh, he does have a bottle of whiskey.

1923
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:33,180
Uh-oh.

1924
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,200
I hope we're not on this train much longer.

1925
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:38,320
That blood could come from anywhere.

1926
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:45,020
Looks like Chuck has some booze left.

1927
02:11:47,140 --> 02:12:16,660
we're just gonna take that so he doesn't you know it's a fifth of whiskey oh wow that's a lot okay chucks camp he's lived here a while what oh what's he got scissors in chucks bag oh that's right we gotta cut her hair give it to kenny those are huge we're not gonna give the man who is driving the train oh you know what let's try it Alright,

1928
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:18,300
I'll be right back, Clementine.

1929
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:30,140
It's not like he's steering.

1930
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:30,920
That's so true.

1931
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:32,440
Oh, I can't.

1932
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,220
It won't let me.

1933
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:35,160
If you want to drink, let me ask.

1934
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:37,580
About my past.

1935
02:12:37,620 --> 02:12:40,560
I wanted to talk to you about keeping my past from your...

1936
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,020
You told us it was your parents' store back in Macon.

1937
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,220
That was enough personal information.

1938
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:51,340
I'm sure... Cat would be okay with you, so forget it.

1939
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:52,760
Okay.

1940
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:54,440
Oh.

1941
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,520
I don't think we should give it to him.

1942
02:12:57,940 --> 02:13:01,440
We don't know what this guy is like drunk, but we can find out.

1943
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:07,620
I found this if you wanted.

1944
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,140
Damn.

1945
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:11,780

What a crappy day.

1970
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:05,980
That's such an understatement.

1971
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,540
You need to know how to protect yourself.

1972
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:15,980
Like hiding or running away?

1973
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:17,340
Got it.

1974
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:19,300
I mean, with one of these.

1975
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:19,760
Uh-oh.

1976
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:21,260
First, look at her face.

1977
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:22,080
She's like, uh-uh.

1978
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,100
It's just a thing.

1979
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:32,580
Take it, but know where your finger is all the time and don't put it on the trigger unless you want to hurt somebody Okay, okay Trigger discipline.

1980
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:33,480
It's not scary.

1981
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,720
It's a little scary.

1982
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:45,860
You'll get stronger to aim you look right down the top through that notch Line up the sight at the end with your target Is there anything else I should know?

1983
02:17:48,160 --> 02:18:07,780
Aim for the head when you're ready to shoot make sure you're not breathing too hard and then hold your breath right when you pull the trigger like when i'm swimming no just for a quick second i found that if i did that it's a lot more accurate is the is the safety on i'm kind of i can do that okay

1984
02:18:11,780 --> 02:19:19,220
uh hold on i'm trying to blow my nose at the same time good don't lock your elbows okay let's take your first shot squeeze the trigger smoothly and i'll cover your ears nice and easy okay nice and easy oh you okay the hands hurt i don't like this let's stick with it okay do i have to yeah i'll be welcome to membership thank you don't lock your yeah keep it steady close now keep it steady aim higher okay a little higher day oh too high aim left okay aim a little bit more to the left aim lower aim lower oh too too much aim right to the right keep it steady steady now almost got it I got it excellent good shot good shot oh again

1985
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:46,130
okay aim left a little bit more to the left and aim lower a little bit lower there you go nice okay clown again again fix your arms

1986
02:19:49,360 --> 02:20:25,340
i did it yeah you did good job good job i was holding my breath and the gun didn't shake so much not walkers though no far from it but you know how these things work now we'll graduate you to walkers one day okay i feel good that's so scary huh no oh gosh please be careful fast learner holy cow you taught clementine to protect yourself my hands hurt and my ears have noise in them like

1987
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,400
Ah, what a crappy day.

1988
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:32,600
What a crappy day.

1989
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:34,180
She's pretty good.

1990
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:36,700
Three months ago, I'd known what you'd be seeing.

1991
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,020
I don't know if I would have taken you with me.

1992
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:41,200
I probably would have run out of food.

1993
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,300
You're damn near starved with me.

1994
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,200
I'm glad I came with you.

1995
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:48,960
What do you think about Chuck?

1996
02:20:48,980 --> 02:20:49,900
What do you think about Chuck?

1997
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,040
I don't know.

1998
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:52,040
Me neither.

1999
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,840
He might be an okay guy, though.

2000
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:55,820
First rule of gun safety is have fun.

2001
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:57,560
So true.

2002
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:29,040
I want to talk about Savannah Me too And what we're going to do when we get there We don't know what to expect The city could be bad or totally under control I don't know The thing is You and I, we're a team, you know And a team needs a plan Aside from everyone else When this train stops You and I should know exactly what we're doing A plan I like it Not put in a cough drop Good Good Oh,

2003
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:32,420
we should go our own way.

2004
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,240
Uh, we should find a...

2005
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:35,540
We need to help find a boat.

2006
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:36,940
It's our best bet at safety.

2007
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:41,120
Okay, but we'll be in Savannah, and my parents were in Savannah.

2008
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,040
I know.

2009
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:42,760
Look.

2010
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,200
No, I don't care about safety.

2011
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,240
I care about finding them.

2012
02:21:51,370 --> 02:21:52,790
We'll look for them.

2013
02:21:52,810 --> 02:21:54,230
Okay, we'll look for them.

2014
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:55,030
We'll just... Really?

2015
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:56,810
Yes, of course.

2016
02:21:56,810 --> 02:21:57,230
Clem!

2017
02:21:57,430 --> 02:21:57,910
I'm sorry.

2018
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,350
Let's look at the map.

2019
02:22:00,690 --> 02:23:22,270
where they were we can start there okay let's oh looks like we'll come right through town if there's nothing on the tracks to hold us up she gonna see her zombified parents here I imagine and from there we got all the Savannah to the southwest of us now we've got a good chunk of Savannah here what do you think they always stay in the same place when they go there oh it's hmm hey don't worry we'll figure it out have you ever been there once well think about it tales on here but read this map and maybe it'll jog your memory yeah they've got really tasty desserts it's called the M something me are is this it the marsh house the marsh yes that's it oh there we go we'll head there yes yeah they'd be rotting zombies I think it's very good can I tell my parents you know sure sure go ahead why are we not gonna I know we're still treating her like a little girl but like wait what does she want to tell them actually now I think about what what does she want to tell them what hey clip hi that I'm

2020
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:44,230
a murderer you're probably not gonna like this oh no what happened nothing we have to talk about someone it's not safe that's not nice what are you saying it smells no what cuz it does oh kind of oh oh do you remember when Andy st.

2021
02:23:44,470 --> 02:24:01,670
John grabbed it and I got mad yeah well that could happen again and if it's a walker well we need to trim it just trim the best haircut is some what's wrong with her eyes I think I thought...

2022
02:24:04,430 --> 02:24:06,090
I think she's a little broke.

2023
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:08,490
I guess not.

2024
02:24:08,770 --> 02:24:09,510
Don't mow.

2025
02:24:10,130 --> 02:24:11,590
It's a good thing.

2026
02:24:12,890 --> 02:24:13,530
Oh, there she is.

2027
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:14,490
Lift your head, Clem.

2028
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,330
You can do it.

2029
02:24:15,570 --> 02:24:17,210
Her hair is way too heavy.

2030
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:18,850
This is why we're cutting her.

2031
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:19,630
Do you know how to do this?

2032
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:22,870
Uh, how hard can it be?

2033
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:24,050
Oh my god!

2034
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:26,150
We just cut to this.

2035
02:24:26,990 --> 02:24:27,710
We just...

2036
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:28,130
Oh, okay.

2037
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:29,470
It's still there.

2038
02:24:29,890 --> 02:25:26,770
you did kill someone before yeah i'm glad you finally told me i thought it cut to the next scene and he chopped off everything it doesn't even matter that's true just joining team bald here we'll we'll go bald in solidarity killing is bad no matter what oh killing is bad no matter what yeah but you do it now to protect yourself and to protect me doesn't make it good but you have to I do it because it's necessary walkers aren't people yeah okay I think I'm about done I can probably tear these pieces back with some here I have some hair thingies you do hair thing yeah I also call them that for sleeping there everybody's dead oh my gosh

2039
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:31,190
Does it look dumb?

2040
02:25:31,710 --> 02:25:33,750
Wait, he gave her pigtails, it's so cute!

2041
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:36,990
Wait, I can also have twin tails.

2042
02:25:39,630 --> 02:25:41,730
It's so bright, sorry, sorry.

2043
02:25:44,970 --> 02:25:46,250
She looks so cute.

2044
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:47,210
How do you feel?

2045
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:48,530
Good.

2046
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:49,250
Better.

2047
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:51,170
I'm glad we have a plan.

2048
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:53,130
And you're a good little chef.

2049
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:54,210
Thanks.

2050
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:56,190
I guess we should see how far.

2051
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:56,970
Oh, shit!

2052
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:58,010
Hold on, everybody!

2053
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:02,880
Oh, my ears.

2054
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:08,900
Charles is like, whatever.

2055
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:20,180
Oh.

2056
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,040
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

2057
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:32,160
Maybe we could walk.

2058
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,740
That's fucking stupid, Ben.

2059
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:36,180
I'm just saying.

2060
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:38,760
Hmm, I don't know.

2061
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:44,260
I ain't got much experience with y'all's fortitude, but we could probably deal with that.

2062
02:26:44,340 --> 02:26:44,780
Uh, or you?

2063
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,100
We got a goddamn train.

2064
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:48,920
A thing's not full of milk, Charles.

2065
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:49,580
Yeah, exactly.

2066
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:50,560
It's flammable.

2067
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:51,040
It's gas or diesel.

2068
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,940
Something that's going to explode.

2069
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:55,660
You've got to get a hold of yourself.

2070
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,560
This is a crew here.

2071
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,260
Oh.

2072
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:01,080
This ain't shit.

2073
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:01,700
This.

2074
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:05,240
Yo, you keep screaming like that and you're going to get your face chewed off.

2075
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:05,620
Oh!

2076
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:06,900
Are you guys going to be trouble?

2077
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:08,860
Because we could have just kept walking.

2078
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:12,540
Oh, oh, oh, define trouble.

2079
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:13,540
Why is my thing?

2080
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:14,640
Define trouble.

2081
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:16,500
Define trouble.

2082
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:23,220
Anything that gets you killed or worse, and it tends to come hand in hand with groups of guys in distress.

2083
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:24,600
Let's give these guys a break.

2084
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:25,420
We'll see.

2085
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:26,380
They'll remember that.

2086
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:27,700
You guys got a problem with your train?

2087
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:30,280
Yeah, you're standing right in front of it.

2088
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:31,640
Dude, it's a wreck.

2089
02:27:32,020 --> 02:27:33,180
It's not so bad from up here.

2090
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:34,960
Send your buddy up to have a look.

2091
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:36,400
Hold up.

2092
02:27:37,360 --> 02:28:09,600
ways up there we won't let them escape okay I'm coming we'll be down here okay we're gonna get a good old beautiful view if I come up there you better not be murderers or thieves I guess you'll have to find out keeping me in suspense a group of guys is what we need they're what you think we We're doing fine for now.

2093
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,480
What about when stop it when?

2094
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:13,080
Hey, dude.

2095
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,780
I'm Omid Lee.

2096
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:15,180
Hey, dude.

2097
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:16,900
Krista wants to deal with the train.

2098
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:18,280
We're driving it.

2099
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:23,380
Oh, man Uh, it's been a bad day.

2100
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:33,460
Oh, yeah, I'm not gonna bullshit you our group is a little fucked right now He had a bite victim then his mom took her life and before that just it's okay.

2101
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:34,680
Yeah, it's been a bad day.

2102
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:40,500
Oh shit Oh What are you doing up here?

2103
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:42,880
Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a kid?

2104
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:43,600
Shit!

2105
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:44,620
What's your name?

2106
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:45,540
Why are you so excited?

2107
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:48,540
Oh, so he gets to swear.

2108
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:49,920
Oh, this is great!

2109
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:50,660
See?

2110
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:51,900
Things are looking up.

2111
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:53,160
You're not her dad.

2112
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:54,160
He down there?

2113
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,720
It's that obvious?

2114
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:56,820
To me.

2115
02:28:57,300 --> 02:28:59,260
And no, he's not down there.

2116
02:28:59,820 --> 02:28:59,920
Huh.

2117
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:01,400
What's your story?

2118
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:06,400
I don't understand why people think it's so weird that like a girl is traveling without a...

2119
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:06,840
Yeah.

2120
02:29:08,140 --> 02:29:10,200
I came across Clementine alone.

2121
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:11,900
First day all of this happened.

2122
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:14,180
You know, like, everybody's so weird about it.

2123
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:15,080
And everybody down there.

2124
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:20,420
In this kind of situation, it just feels very like, um, Ben is young and stupid.

2125
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:24,760
Ben's young and stupid, and I think harmless.

2126
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:25,560
I know, no, no.

2127
02:29:25,960 --> 02:29:27,120
I did not say that!

2128
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:28,600
I did not say that!

2129
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:30,500
I know, we just have to keep an eye on him.

2130
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,000
No!

2131
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:33,700
It's been rough for everybody down there.

2132
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:35,380
I'm sure you can say the same.

2133
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,340
We're sorry for anything that's happened.

2134
02:29:37,360 --> 02:30:01,680
to you guys that train is awesome though that tank is a real problem we'll help you with it but if we see anything we don't like we're moving on down the road alone we'd appreciate the help you can't just blast through it i guess if you could get it down the rest would probably be pretty easy did we forget that did we forget that four people are dead because of ben i cannot believe this

2135
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:37,470
oh gosh okay well this seems really difficult i'm not gonna lie let's go talk to your people man oh me what he's so excited am i gonna have to tell your people the plan or what okay hold on i'm looking around gosh it's empty uh-oh there's somebody in there folks probably had their way Mostly harmless.

2136
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:44,450
Oh, okay.

2137
02:30:46,810 --> 02:30:48,310
We got some tape.

2138
02:30:51,090 --> 02:30:51,150
Nice.

2139
02:30:51,150 --> 02:30:53,070
That's about the only useful thing in here.

2140
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:56,050
Oh, gosh.

2141
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:59,170
I didn't say that at all about Ben.

2142
02:31:00,010 --> 02:31:02,010
Oh, they put words into my mouth.

2143
02:31:04,870 --> 02:31:26,610
I think I've said it before, but like people are so like I understand that it's just like a girl without a girl a kid walking or kid going around without their parents is weird but like in this sort of situation it does not seem weird at all whatever government work was going on here didn't seem to help

2144
02:31:29,690 --> 02:32:33,750
like in fact it seems like oh you saved this kid I don't know an apocalypse you ever people are just finding everybody angle to hell no releasing it no nothing i don't know there's no way i'm pulling anything apart down there all right let's go talk to our friends guys this is oh meeting krista big on welcomes i told you we had a bad day yeah we just wanted to say hi and say your train it's pretty cool but we're not looking for charity we could help you guys though maybe it's time we move forward yes oh meet and Krista gonna help us we're gonna get past this damn tanker we're happy to stick around we'll see about that you want to start in on that tanker I'll get to know the girl for a minute if you don't mind yeah I'll show you how this thing works in case something happens oh really kid it's probably for the best oh someone might want to have a look inside of that station.

2145
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:35,090
Show me how this works.

2146
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:35,570
Sounds great.

2147
02:32:36,050 --> 02:32:37,050
Let's do this thing.

2148
02:32:37,210 --> 02:32:38,070
I'm Kenny.

2149
02:32:39,070 --> 02:32:40,330
I'm sad, Kenny.

2150
02:32:44,690 --> 02:32:46,050
Is he playing the guitar?

2151
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:49,950
I'm glad someone's managed to keep this spirit.

2152
02:32:52,570 --> 02:32:53,030
Oh.

2153
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:56,550
I'm the

2154
02:32:59,740 --> 02:33:00,360
Rumban.

2155
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:02,480
All this power, we're still stuck.

2156
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:05,140
Deserves to die.

2157
02:33:07,940 --> 02:34:04,920
what are you doing up there anyway do a flip he's actually so stupid got a clear view up there yeah we're good for a ways thank god no he's being lookout someone anyone to come along in and exterminate them or something us wait uh oh the the the walkers get used to them i don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon yeah well their numbers keep up and ours I'm telling you if they ever get a hold of me and I know I'm not getting out of it that's it man I'm just gonna punch my own ticket punch your own ticket yeah take myself out don't be dramatic and don't let them get a hold of that's right stupid

2158
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,440
That's right.

2159
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:11,600
I don't think there's anything else down there.

2160
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:13,740
The flower.

2161
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:18,600
Oh.

2162
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:22,360
Always with the scenarios.

2163
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:25,240
Oh, what a guy.

2164
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:27,280
Wait.

2165
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:32,180
Hi, Clementine.

2166
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:34,820
So cute.

2167
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:39,100
You interrogating this woman for us?

2168
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:39,500
Yeah.

2169
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:39,840
Yep.

2170
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,120
Gee, set off any alarm bells?

2171
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:43,620
Not yet.

2172
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:45,240
She's very thorough.

2173
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:45,740
Oh, good.

2174
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,100
That's what I like to hear.

2175
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:50,100
Yeah, they're having girls talk.

2176
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,240
Oh, hey there.

2177
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:55,840
That's a pretty useful radio for her to be holding on to, no?

2178
02:34:56,460 --> 02:34:59,080
It's busted, but it means something to her.

2179
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:00,900
Oh, I understand.

2180
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:02,040
Yeah.

2181
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:05,640
Careful, she's a crackshot now.

2182
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:07,680
Careful, she's a crackshot now.

2183
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:09,840
You got this girl shooting guns?

2184
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:11,560
Look, I don't need a lecture.

2185
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:12,980
You weren't getting one.

2186
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:13,800
It's good.

2187
02:35:14,140 --> 02:35:15,680
Yeah, should be able to take care of it.

2188
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:16,740
Exactly, exactly.

2189
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:19,060
She's cross-eyed.

2190
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:19,640
Gosh.

2191
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:23,940
She's high on the on the on the excitement.

2192
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:25,940
She's like, yeah, I can shoot guns.

2193
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:27,960
Oh my gosh.

2194
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:30,960
Where are you from?

2195
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:32,240
San Francisco.

2196
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:34,700
Oh, geez, a long way from home.

2197
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:36,640
I blame the one in there.

2198
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:39,260
He wanted the great American route trip.

2199
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:53,040
he got a little more than he bargained for huh who the hell is into civil war history anyway other than old white guys wonderful you two be thick as thieves

2200
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:06,900
why was he

2201
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:16,010
He looked so damn goofy about it.

2202
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:18,230
Oh my god.

2203
02:36:18,710 --> 02:36:19,750
He's so funny.

2204
02:36:22,530 --> 02:36:22,810
Oh.

2205
02:36:23,710 --> 02:36:26,570
What are you guys arguing about when I was coming up the ladder?

2206
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:28,090
Nothing.

2207
02:36:28,830 --> 02:36:32,110
If you're gonna be around for a while, Master Ballad and welcome back.

2208
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:32,730
Thank you.

2209
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:35,530
Then maybe we won't be around for a while.

2210
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:40,070
Krista didn't appreciate you prying.

2211
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:41,810
The zombie outbreak happened.

2212
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:43,170
I hope I get to meet men.

2213
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:45,730
I know whatever group she ends up will survive.

2214
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:49,830
But also, I'm a ghost, so...

2215
02:36:50,730 --> 02:36:52,270
What do you think he's a professor of?

2216
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:54,290
Was he a professor of history?

2217
02:36:54,490 --> 02:36:55,170
I can't remember.

2218
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:58,610
Not sure how we'll get that tank down.

2219
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:00,010
Maybe ask Omid.

2220
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:01,590
He likes to break things.

2221
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:02,690
Omid.

2222
02:37:04,130 --> 02:37:04,390
Okay.

2223
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:05,950
I like the music.

2224
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:10,190
Alright, we're gonna go check out the...

2225
02:37:10,190 --> 02:37:11,810

2231
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:26,180
Somebody was doing some painting.

2232
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,500
Yeah, we see survivors inside.

2233
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:31,800
Somebody was doing a lot of painting.

2234
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:34,580
Somebody was doing some painting.

2235
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:37,560
Somebody was doing a lot of painting.

2236
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,380
How did they get in though?

2237
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:46,900

She's my little baby girl.

02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,140
Nah, she'll be okay.

2244
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,860
But I'm not have to let her out.

2245
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:17,600
Later on.

2246
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:20,980
I got a fork.

2247
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,560
I think that thing's worked in years.

2248
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:23,240
Dang.

2249
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:26,200
This place seems kind of busted.

2250
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:29,240
Let's see.

2251
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:31,800
I can't see in there.

2252
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:32,660
Hmm.

2253
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:38,160
Um, and it's locked?

2254
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:42,560
What's Clementine got?

2255
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:43,980
We'll have to find a way here.

2256
02:43:49,070 --> 02:43:50,270
Oh, hello.

2257
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:53,690
Old Bert.

2258
02:43:54,750 --> 02:43:55,010
Okay.

2259
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,630
Hmm.

2260
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:02,270
Hmm.

2261
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:08,780
I don't see another way.

2262
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:12,920
Yeah, we could try knocking, right?

2263
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,340
Like, if there's...

2264
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:27,420
I can't I don't know why we need to look at all these signs It's making me nervous like do I have to remember them Uh okay there's nothing on this side

2265
02:44:32,810 --> 02:44:37,350
Well yeah I feel like if it says survivors inside why don't we try knocking right

2266
02:44:42,710 --> 02:45:15,500
Let's see Is this are these signs gonna be the test oh i see the window above the door the windows open up there maybe i could look in okay the windows open up there maybe i could look in why don't i put you on my shoulders and you can peek into that window up there sounds good

2267
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:20,510
Thank you.

2268
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:23,030
Okay, I can see in.

2269
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:24,470
What do I do now?

2270
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,150
Uh, what do you see?

2271
02:45:27,290 --> 02:45:27,770
What do you see?

2272
02:45:28,350 --> 02:45:30,130
Lots of crates and stuff.

2273
02:45:30,670 --> 02:45:34,090
Maybe we can find the key or figure out a way to knock this door down.

2274
02:45:34,710 --> 02:45:39,190
Kenny'd probably have me pick the lock, which actually might work now that we have the time.

2275
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:40,190
I think I opened it.

2276
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:40,970
For real?

2277
02:45:41,190 --> 02:45:41,990
I think so.

2278
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:48,710
Well, I'll be damned.

2279
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:51,090
Okay, Miss Clementine.

2280
02:45:52,250 --> 02:45:52,690
Wow.

2281
02:45:53,630 --> 02:45:54,210
Let's go.

2282
02:45:54,630 --> 02:45:55,570
Be careful.

2283
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:57,430
I'm supposed to tell you that.

2284
02:45:57,570 --> 02:45:59,150
It just saved, so I'm scared.

2285
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:10,100
I wouldn't let that door shut.

2286
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:11,440
Damn, it's dark in here.

2287
02:46:11,980 --> 02:46:13,660
Maybe I can hold the door open?

2288
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:15,680
I don't like that.

2289
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:17,320
I'll prop it open with something.

2290
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,620
Yeah, I was gonna say...

2291
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,200
What's...

2292
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:31,240
Why do we have a timer?

2293
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:31,880
Oh, okay.

2294
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:33,640
Okay.

2295
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:35,020
We're fine.

2296
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:37,600
There's gotta be something useful in here.

2297
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:38,320
Shipping in...

2298
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:39,760
There could be anything!

2299
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:41,660
How are we doing?

2300
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:42,340
Good.

2301
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:43,700
What do we need?

2302
02:46:44,100 --> 02:46:45,820
Something to help us deal with the tanker out there.

2303
02:46:45,820 --> 02:46:46,780
Yeah, why was there a timer?

2304
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:49,860
Something to help with what?

2305
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:52,780
Why is it like a jail?

2306
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:58,100
It's locked up good, but there's some space at the top.

2307
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:58,500
Oh, no.

2308
02:46:58,560 --> 02:46:59,080
We're lucky.

2309
02:46:59,240 --> 02:46:59,860
I'm so little.

2310
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:00,300
No!

2311
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:01,100
Yeah, we are.

2312
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:03,140
You know who else was little?

2313
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:08,000
Oh, I called her small.

2314
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:10,040
Oh, Carly.

2315
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:11,760
Oh, Carly.

2316
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:18,100
Don't say duck.

2317
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:19,420
I wasn't going to.

2318
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:21,100
Wait, am I actually going to boost her?

2319
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,980
There's some space up there, but not much.

2320
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:26,000
We're lucky, I'm so little.

2321
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:27,140
Yeah, we are.

2322
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:29,160
Well, I guess come here.

2323
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:31,240
We're going to boost you again, Clementine.

2324
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,240
Oh, this is going to be bad.

2325
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:33,460
You okay going over the top of this fence?

2326
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,140
I think this is bad.

2327
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:34,800
This is bad.

2328
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:35,480
Yeah, definitely.

2329
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:36,400
Huh?

2330
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:38,880
Oh my god, it just saved.

2331
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:40,160
Go on and grab the keys, Clem.

2332
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:43,680
Come on, scoot.

2333
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:47,520
Behind you!

2334
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:49,480
Oh, gosh!

2335
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:50,280
Fuck!

2336
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:53,800
Where did they come from?

2337
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:55,780
Oh my god, no, no, no.

2338
02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:00,940
Uh, get the thing.

2339
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:16,640
I'm the walking dead.

2340
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:19,040
Go on and grab the keys, Clem.

2341
02:48:19,100 --> 02:48:19,820
That was fast!

2342
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:21,200
That was really bad.

2343
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:23,480
Come on, scoot.

2344
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:26,280
Behind you!

2345
02:48:26,500 --> 02:48:27,700
Where did they come from, though?

2346
02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:30,960
Also, survivors inside.

2347
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:32,340
You guys are such bonies.

2348
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:35,880
When did the zombies learn how to ride?

2349
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:42,220
Get it, get it, get it!

2350
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:46,320
Got

2351
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:51,080

they're learning.

2355
02:49:08,470 --> 02:49:09,150
Little big.

2356
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:09,630
It's okay.

2357
02:49:09,830 --> 02:49:10,210
It's okay.

2358
02:49:10,450 --> 02:49:11,250
Everything's fine.

2359
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:21,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2360
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:24,420
Keys, now!

2361
02:49:27,930 --> 02:49:28,710
Oh, my God.

2362
02:49:28,830 --> 02:49:29,190
Oh, my God.

2363
02:49:31,350 --> 02:49:32,470

Fear is the mind killer.

It's true.

2375
02:52:00,620 --> 02:52:01,500
It's true.

2376
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:08,170
Is this guy's name again?

2377
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:08,910
Odin?

2378
02:52:09,590 --> 02:52:11,450
I found a blowtorch in the station.

2379
02:52:11,990 --> 02:52:14,130
Should make quick work of the coupling up there.

2380
02:52:15,290 --> 02:52:15,710
Excellent.

Turn it off, dude.

2387
02:52:57,450 --> 02:52:59,650
I don't want my eyebrows burned off.

2388
02:53:00,810 --> 02:53:01,970
Better plug that leak with something.

2389
02:53:02,190 --> 02:53:03,350
Dog never dies!

2390
02:53:04,770 --> 02:53:06,590
Odin, the Allfather.

2391
02:53:07,310 --> 02:53:08,450
I don't know what I...

2392
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:10,970
Uh...

2393
02:53:10,970 --> 02:53:11,890
Oh, I got the tape!

2394
02:53:11,970 --> 02:53:12,350
That's right.

2395
02:53:15,370 --> 02:53:17,770
This guy's eyes are bugging, though.

2396
02:53:18,210 --> 02:53:20,370
It kind of scares me.

2397
02:53:23,470 --> 02:53:24,410
Everybody's a dog.

2398
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:25,470
Everybody's a dog.

2399
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:27,010
That's crazy.

2400
02:53:27,230 --> 02:53:28,130
Look at it go.

2401
02:53:29,130 --> 02:53:31,610
Just about got it I'm scared

2402
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:37,300
Whoa, thanks no sweat man.

2403
02:53:37,980 --> 02:53:45,240
This thing is hanging by a thread the smallest cut and it'll go Levi look at the membership there.

2404
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:45,880
Thank you.

2405
02:53:45,900 --> 02:53:46,360
Thank you.

2406
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:46,980
Thank you.

2407
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,640
I'm all bad with names now.

2408
02:53:50,300 --> 02:53:59,660
I'm sorry Here the weak portion of the couplings out of my reach you think it'll be within mine No But I'm gonna dangle you over that ledge.

2409
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:01,220
The hell you are.

2410
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:01,780
Yeah.

2411
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:06,260
God, you're a real son of a bitch, aren't you?

2412
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:08,040
Shut up and start cutting.

2413
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:09,360
Start cutting.

2414
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:22,720
Guys!

2415
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:24,860
There's something coming!

2416
02:54:25,360 --> 02:54:26,040
What the what?

2417
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:27,720
There must be thousands.

2418
02:54:28,700 --> 02:54:29,860
We gotta go!

2419
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:31,380
Fuck.

2420
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:33,280
Omi, cut, cut!

2421
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,860

2422
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:37,140
It's going!

2423
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:37,980
Pull me up!

2424
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:41,800

2426
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:48,550
Can he go?

2427
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:53,680
Oh my god.

2428
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:54,840
Oh my god.

2429
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:06,420
Let's blow her up, baby.

2430
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:07,700
Holy crap.

2431
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:12,360
Wait, maybe wait for the train to go.

2432
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:14,900
We gotta jump.

2433
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:15,340
What?

2434
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:16,340
No way.

2435
02:55:17,340 --> 02:55:18,020
Yes way.

2436
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:20,260
We gotta.

2437
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:22,900
Um.

2438
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:26,040
Oh wait.

2439
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:26,400
Jump!

2440
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:29,160
Jump, damn it!

2441
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:29,480
Jump!

2442
02:55:30,060 --> 02:55:31,000
With his eyes.

2443
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:36,640
Come on!

2444
02:55:37,220 --> 02:55:37,620
Okay.

2445
02:55:38,400 --> 02:55:38,800
Oh.

2446
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:40,900
Shit.

2447
02:55:46,060 --> 02:55:46,900
He's fine.

2448
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:48,540
Get him up.

2449
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:49,660
Yep, there you go.

2450
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:04,360
No!

2451
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:05,900
Wait, she can keep running!

2452
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:07,260
You piece of shit?

2453
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,040
She's a woman, don't you know...

2454
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:11,460
What are you talking about?

2455
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:12,380
She's fine!

2456
02:56:13,300 --> 02:56:14,460
It's okay, honey.

2457
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:15,740
I'm okay.

2458
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:19,200
You were the one lip-pick you wouldn't have made it!

2459
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:23,320
She seems really fit, yeah.

2460
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:24,740
I think she's fine.

2461
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:25,700
She's a woman.

2462
02:56:25,820 --> 02:56:26,980
What was that supposed to mean?

2463
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:29,060
The fuck?

2464
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:30,900
That was a lot, Bill.

2465
02:56:31,340 --> 02:56:32,260
Are you hurt?

2466
02:56:32,580 --> 02:56:33,960
No, we're okay.

2467
02:56:34,580 --> 02:56:35,560
Speak for yourself.

2468
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:36,940
My leg is fucked.

2469
02:56:37,360 --> 02:56:38,220
That's your fault.

2470
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:39,460
You didn't stick the landing.

2471
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:41,140
Fine.

2472
02:56:43,140 --> 02:56:54,900
so excited anymore i like how some of the zombies are frozen like they're all not moving some of them are just like little pngs

2473
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:01,450
they just give up yeah

2474
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:07,840
is that kenny

2475
02:57:15,250 --> 02:57:19,180
i wasn't gonna push him i'm not i'm not his mom

2476
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:25,650
No, I saw him.

2477
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,610
I saw a little quack, quack.

2478
02:57:28,130 --> 02:57:29,030
I saw him.

2479
02:57:30,950 --> 02:57:32,210
Oh, it's all three of them.

2480
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:33,330
Oh, he can't see this.

2481
02:57:33,410 --> 02:57:34,350
It'll break his little heart.

2482
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:36,270
It'll break his Kenny heart.

2483
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:44,200
We trust the ladies are more independent than men on this train.

2484
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:46,900
The lady?

2485
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:49,160
Well, there's just one.

2486
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:51,180
We will.

2487
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,540
It was a real sausage fest here for a moment.

2488
02:57:54,780 --> 02:57:57,460
You'll be all right.

2489
02:57:57,780 --> 02:57:58,600
You'll be all right.

2490
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:01,380
I'll be alive, I guess.

2491
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:03,220
The tried and true advice.

2492
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:05,100
You'll get over it.

2493
02:58:05,320 --> 02:58:06,580
I'll leave you to your thoughts.

2494
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,560
She's out cold like I've never seen.

2495
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:14,940
Oh?

2496
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,700
No way.

2497
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:25,280
Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine.

2498
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:27,120
I got your parents right here.

2499
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:31,160
And you be sure to find me whether Lee wants you to or not.

2500
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:32,380
Now, what do I need?

2501
02:58:33,240 --> 02:58:34,200
Holy shit.

2502
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:34,680
Lee?

2503
02:58:34,900 --> 02:58:35,180
Wait, what?

2504
02:58:35,180 --> 02:58:36,960
I thought that fucking thing was broken.

2505
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:38,900
So did I.

2506
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:43,660
Well, sounds like somebody knows where we're headed.

2507
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:45,760
Who the fuck?

2508
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:46,060
How?

2509
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:46,420
What?

2510
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:47,020
I don't know.

2511
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:47,380
What?

2512
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:50,140
But I doubt we're going to be happy when we find out.

2513
02:58:50,380 --> 02:58:50,840
What?

2514
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:52,440
How do they know?

2515
02:58:52,860 --> 02:58:53,340
Oh, my God.

2516
02:58:53,420 --> 02:58:54,880
She's like the president or something.

2517
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:56,540
Clementine is the president.

2518
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:01,300
She's a secret princess.

2519
02:59:01,900 --> 02:59:02,500
Wait, what?

2520
02:59:06,650 --> 02:59:07,850
We're almost at the river.

2521
02:59:08,410 --> 02:59:09,310
You want to get on a boat?

2522
02:59:09,610 --> 02:59:11,950
You want to wait around till the walkers figure out we're here?

2523
02:59:12,470 --> 02:59:14,670
We need to focus on finding the boat right now, Cloud.

2524
02:59:15,410 --> 02:59:16,810
Like we talked about on the train.

2525
02:59:17,690 --> 02:59:19,770
No, we talked about finding her parents at the...

2526
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:22,310
I don't know how much longer he can keep on like this.

2527
02:59:22,750 --> 02:59:25,550
If his leg gets any worse, we're going to have to carry him.

2528
02:59:25,870 --> 02:59:26,730
Or leave him.

2529
02:59:27,410 --> 02:59:27,830
Doug.

2530
02:59:28,190 --> 02:59:29,510
If I were you, I'd get...

2531
02:59:29,530 --> 02:59:46,910
out of the street now who the hell is this answer me damn it this is crazy what is this mystery who have you been talking to oh you come back here i'll kill you you understand i will kill you

2532
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:06,560
let's see you and 59 of players did not shoot the girl on the streets my gosh so much has happened this episode?

2533
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:08,360
I completely forgot about her.

2534
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:11,620
You and 42% of players left Lily.

2535
03:00:11,980 --> 03:00:12,900
I mean, come on.

2536
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:15,920
55% of people fought Kenny.

2537
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:17,180
I did fight that guy.

2538
03:00:18,680 --> 03:00:19,580
A lot of people.

2539
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:21,300
Almost everybody shot Duck.

2540
03:00:21,740 --> 03:00:23,400
79% of people shot Duck.

2541
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:26,180
Clearly been at the end.

2542
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,560
And then you and 55% of players helped

2543
03:00:35,700 --> 03:01:03,420
at me for it my gosh he wouldn't have made it he would have died only 42 percent of people left lily they're crazy they're crazy but i'm i feel like i'm playing pretty in the middle so far so like uh i think i think uh usually i have like one thing that is an overwhelming majority that most

2544
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:08,140
Hey baby girl.

2545
03:01:08,460 --> 03:01:09,020
Come here.

2546
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:11,120
Come here baby girl.

2547
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:13,040
What are you doing laying on the ground?

2548
03:01:13,740 --> 03:01:14,560
Are you so cute?

2549
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:16,620
Are you the cutest girl in the world?

2550
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:19,000
Are you the cutest girl ever?

2551
03:01:19,220 --> 03:01:21,300
The littlest, tiniest baby girl.

2552
03:01:21,740 --> 03:01:23,180
Are you my little baby baby?

2553
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:25,020
Pies.

2554
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:25,760
Pies.

2555
03:01:26,080 --> 03:01:26,500
Pies.

2556
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:26,760
Pies.

2557
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:28,160
Look at me.

2558
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:29,620
She's not even looking at me.

2559
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:30,560
She hates me.

2560
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:33,580
My cat hates me.

2561
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:36,740
Ah!

2562
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:39,120
Oh well.

2563
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:45,230
But yeah, oh my gosh.

2564
03:01:47,110 --> 03:01:48,850
What an episode that was.

2565
03:01:50,190 --> 03:01:52,510
That was a long road ahead.

2566
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:54,650
That was actually insane.

2567
03:01:55,870 --> 03:01:58,110
We lost so many people.

2568
03:01:58,910 --> 03:01:59,350
Duck.

2569
03:02:01,710 --> 03:02:02,130
Lily.

2570
03:02:03,430 --> 03:02:03,990
Carly.

2571
03:02:05,890 --> 03:02:06,630
Katya.

2572
03:02:09,490 --> 03:02:10,690
Like, wow.

2573
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:14,090
Wow, we lost our home?

2574
03:02:16,870 --> 03:02:17,390
That's crazy.

2575
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:19,470
That was really intense episode.

2576
03:02:20,230 --> 03:02:24,870
Oh, you and 7% of players left hanging.

2577
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:28,490
I didn't know it was time.

2578
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:36,310
And I was in mid-sentence being like, should we leave him hanging?

2579
03:02:36,430 --> 03:02:39,090
And then it said, You left duck hanging.

2580
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:43,890
The last time when Carly died and things just got worse and worse.

2581
03:02:44,090 --> 03:02:44,590
What a ride.

2582
03:02:45,190 --> 03:02:46,190
My gosh.

2583
03:02:48,650 --> 03:02:50,550
Carly, I did not expect at all.

2584
03:02:50,730 --> 03:02:51,490
I don't know why.

2585
03:02:53,290 --> 03:03:01,830
I thought she would have some semblance of, like, love interest plot armor, but that's just not.

2586
03:03:02,110 --> 03:03:03,070
I should know.

2587
03:03:03,250 --> 03:03:04,810
That's not a thing in The Walking Dead.

2588
03:03:05,630 --> 03:03:07,150
Literally nobody has plot armor.

2589
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:21,190
I think I'm most upset about Duck in a way because I feel like I was really fast.

2590
03:03:23,810 --> 03:03:26,550
I feel like I was pretty fast and I shot that thing.

2591
03:03:28,350 --> 03:03:32,160
And I'm upset about it.

2592
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:35,760
The game wants Lee X Kenny.

2593
03:03:37,120 --> 03:03:39,360
Lee on Kennedy.

2594
03:03:43,340 --> 03:03:44,620
It's foretold!

2595
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:47,600
It's already written!

2596
03:03:56,820 --> 03:03:58,100
Leon Kennedy!

2597
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:01,260
She cracked the code!

2598
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:04,420
Only Daryl has plot armor.

2599
03:04:06,020 --> 03:04:08,120
That's Norman Redis, right?

2600
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:12,660
This episode is so rough, mostly thanks to Ben, though.

2601
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:13,580
Thanks for the stream!

2602
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:14,440
Thank you, Timaru!

2603
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:17,040
How did they get out of it?

2604
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:18,680
Yeah.

2605
03:04:22,860 --> 03:04:23,400
Yeah.

2606
03:04:24,380 --> 03:04:24,860
Ben.

2607
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:26,120
I can't believe he...

2608
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:32,120
You know, he could have just said something before...

2609
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:33,820
Before...

2610
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:34,900
Uh...

2611
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:35,580
What's her name?

2612
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:37,220
What even got the gun out?

2613
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:38,000
Uh...

2614
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:38,400
Lily.

2615
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:41,520
Leon, Kenny, D's nuts, got him!

2616
03:04:50,070 --> 03:04:51,690
That made me bald.

2617
03:04:59,270 --> 03:05:26,870
he was correctly afraid of being kicked out well no we kicked out we kicked out lily because she killed a person um we could have just you know we could have done we could have thought of something to do with him i don't know but i do know guys as i am show hungry I'm going to go eat dinner.

2618
03:05:28,790 --> 03:05:30,930
So thank you so much for more Walking Dead.

2619
03:05:31,150 --> 03:05:32,930
I guess we have two more chapters left, right?

2620
03:05:33,290 --> 03:05:34,270
Because it's five chapters.

2621
03:05:37,550 --> 03:05:39,290
And, yep, yep, yep.

2622
03:05:39,750 --> 03:05:40,370
What am I eating?

2623
03:05:40,470 --> 03:05:45,750
I got me some chicken Alfredo with my name on it.

2624
03:05:50,250 --> 03:05:52,590
Thank you, everybody, for hanging out with me again.

2625
03:05:52,690 --> 03:05:53,290
Thanks for watching.

2626
03:05:53,410 --> 03:05:54,590
Thanks so much.

2627
03:05:55,230 --> 03:05:56,390
I will see you when I see you next.

2628
03:05:56,730 --> 03:05:57,190
Have a good day.

2629
03:05:57,270 --> 03:05:57,590
Have a good day.

2630
03:05:57,690 --> 03:05:59,310
Have a good time, Joan.

2631
03:06:00,710 --> 03:06:01,870
And I will see you later.

2632
03:06:03,170 --> 03:06:03,450
Otsobito!

2633
03:06:03,850 --> 03:06:04,930
Ita-tara-shai!

2634
03:06:05,350 --> 03:06:05,910
Bye-bye.
