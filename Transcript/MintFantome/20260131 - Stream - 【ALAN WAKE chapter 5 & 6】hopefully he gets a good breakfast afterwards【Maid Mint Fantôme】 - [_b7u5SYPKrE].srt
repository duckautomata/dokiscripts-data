00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:05,970
Hello everybody, hello everybody, hello everybody, hello
everybody, welcome in!

2
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,310
Welcome in, hi!

3
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,070
Today we're finishing Alan Wake, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

4
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:26,090
I guess we're finishing the main game because there are
still the DLC, the two chapters of DLC, but we will do that

5
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,770
another stream.

6
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,770
Maybe even next week, I don't know.

7
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,610
Thank you for giving me a reason to check out Oshi Uplink in
Toronto this May.

8
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,010
Yes, I got announced!

9
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,130
Me and Denzatsu.dixi, we will be guests at Oshi Uplink.

10
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,610
Going to Canada.

11
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,990
Greetings, Canada.

12
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,870
Let's go.

13
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:55,210
Oh my gosh, Invisible Moose, thank you so much for the 50
gift and say, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

14
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,590
Thinking about going now?

15
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,270
Yeah, they're trying to make more VTuber conventions in
other areas.

16
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,950
So if you are like, man, East Coast never gets anything,
well...

17
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,070
Yeah!

18
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,070
Hello, Minto and I booze like you.

19
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,490
Don't get mad, I spilled paint on the floor again.

20
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,210
Don't get mad, please.

21
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,890
How does this keep happening?

22
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,490
I'm not mad.

23
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,970
I'm not even disappointed.

24
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,170
I'm just confused.

25
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,140
So, I'm just confused.

26
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,340
VTuberCon's everywhere.

27
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,400
Europe still doesn't get anything.

28
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,700
There's literally Vexpo.

29
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,200
I don't know.

30
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,900
I wish I could go to like Doko Min one year.

31
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,020
That would be really fun.

32
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,180
Hmm.

33
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,460
Yay!

34
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,020
DOKOMI looks so cool.

35
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
I know, right?

36
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,960
I want to go, I want to go.

37
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,500
Here are great things about DOKOMI.

38
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,200
Me too.

39
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,260
Me too.

40
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,920
Yeah, well, you know I can only do what I'm invited to.

41
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:32,800
And what is, what is, what cons are the, are available

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,560

44
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:06,390
the sick beat What if it's unk?

45
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,710
Unk, unk, unk, unk, unk.

46
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,120
Unk, unk, unk.

47
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,740
Yeah.

48
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,220
Unks and hags.

49
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,480
I don't know.

50
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,700
Unk sounds so, I mean, because it's just uncle short, right?

51
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,220
It's just, that's what it's supposed to be, right?

52
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,940
Uncle shortened.

53
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,140
But uncle is like not inherently like an old person.

54
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:55,360
you know so i'm kind of confused where this connotation came
from or like where this you know why it's associated with

55
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:10,400
old now baby core thank you for that gift thank you oji san
localized that's what i was thinking too you can be an uncle

56
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,940
at one year exactly that's what i'm saying that's what i'm
an uncle since 10 years old.

57
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,380
Oof.

58
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,600
Oh my gosh.

59
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
Unk status acquired at 10.

60
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,960
Hey, you're born?

61
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,100
You're old now.

62
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,640
You were born yesterday?

63
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,780
Unk.

64
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,540
Oh.

65
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,380
Never even had a chance.

66
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,280
My nephew was born 10 days before me.

67
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,280
Unk.

68
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,540
My name is Alan JP and I'm a viewer excited to see more of
this game.

69
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,300
Oh my gosh viewer Alan JP I'm such a big fan.

70
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,420
I have your standee cut out in my mid cafe.

71
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,420
I wonder what happened to Rose.

72
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,640
I wonder if she's okay.

73
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,840
I wonder if we'll see her again.

74
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,100
I think so probably.

75
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,640
Right hopefully.

76
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,140
My niece was born today.

77
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh my gosh congratulations.

78
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Unk!

79
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,280
Unk!

80
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:16,700
Unk!

81
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,180
I grew up in Singapore.

82
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,680
Unk was just what we called any older man who wasn't related
to us.

83
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,320
Like, taxi drivers were Unkul.

84
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,140
I just figured the rest of the world caught on.

85
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,860
That's what it kind of seems like, right?

86
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,700
That's what it kind of seems like, right?

87
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,040
It seems nicer than being like, Hey, old man!

88
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,260
Hey, you, old man!

89
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Like, hey, Uncle!

90
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:53,400
It's kind of like a friend it feels like familiar like uncle
uncle hey uncle

91
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:11,920
hey old man even like oji san i feel seems to but at the
same time i like oji san feels like you know i guess anyone

92
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:24,180
but like i feel like it's mean to like not mean but i feel
even it's like a little like it has its own connotation

93
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:35,040
right maybe like a g-chan is cuter what speak up young lady
what you said but you wouldn't call like your taxi driver

94
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:45,740
like oni san or something you know it's so i'm i'm What else
is there in Japanese to say?

95
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,260
Hey, vid, do a viewer.

96
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,560
Are you going to watch World Baseball Classic?

97
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,220
And what team are you going for?

98
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm Team Japan because of Shohei.

99
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,920
You know, I don't know anything about baseball.

100
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,840
The only thing I know about baseball is from Power Pro.

101
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,940
And also, when I was a long, long time...

102
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,500
ago i sang the national anthem for like a major game

103
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:40,140
that's all i know but if i were to pick a team it probably
would be with otani shohei because he's on the

104
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:49,480
advertisements for the green team Itoen sponsors him like
crazy That man, you can't escape his face It's crazy

105
00:13:49,480 --> 00:14:00,200
Scandal, I'm actually not an uncle But your name is Uncle
Spooky Wait, don't false advertisement Yeah, he's everywhere

106
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,220
in Japan He really is As soon as you get off the plane
There's advertisements of him He's everywhere

107
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,340
Uncle.

108
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,880
It's kind of crazy how, like, good he is.

109
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,520
Like I do, do, I guess sports do have prodigies, right?

110
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,200
But it's like, I guess you're an athletic prodigy.

111
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
I feel like he is that.

112
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,220
It's kind of insane.

113
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,380
generational talent for sure they definitely do oh yeah

114
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,160
i think it's really cute that sometimes you'll see him like
carrying like a like a hello kitty bag or something because

115
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:11,660
his wife will make him it's pretty it's pretty cute i'm an
ibu prodigy i believe that i believe that i'm old enough to

116
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,480
remember when Yu Darvish was the MLB player the Japanese
loved.

117
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,880
I don't, I've never heard that name before ever.

118
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,760
Is he the LeBron James of Japanese baseball?

119
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,820
Is LeBron James, I mean, I guess he has to be good.

120
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,000
I've always thought he was just a meme, though.

121
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,280
Imagining a young hot Onisan taxi driver.

122
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,280
Wait, no, I shouldn't feed ideas to fish on the novel,
right?

123
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm sure they've already thought about it, to be honest.

124
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,640
No, what's really crazy is when you get a female taxi
driver.

125
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm like, whoa!

126
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,400
Whoa, lady driving me!

127
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,140
Yeah, whoa, wow, whoa!

128
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,240
Because it's so rare.

129
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
I think I've only had one, like, maybe once ever.

130
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,800
Minto, Mr. Wake, to keep you company at work.

131
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,180
Good luck with work!

132
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,910
But at the same time, Taxis are expensive, so...

133
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,250
I only take them in emergencies, if it's like a...

134
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,810
I must get to this location.

135
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,410
But sometimes like if I...

136
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,050
Let's say, um...

137
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,030
Like a before 3D or something.

138
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,150
If I'm like, I don't want to...

139
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,250
I want to conserve my energy, not running from...

140
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,210
Train to train, then I will take a taxi, things like that.

141
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,250
Minto, are you awake or are you awake?

142
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,050
I'm a young Ibu with an unc soul.

143
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,830
Family raised me on the SNES and the Walkmans and VHS
because we didn't have money for the new stuff.

144
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,470
That's culture though.

145
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,410
That's culture.

146
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,130
Don't feel bad.

147
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,070
Don't be like, I think that's even better.

148
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,530
We need more youngins with unc souls.

149
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,670
SNES is an encore I owned in SNES?

150
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,170
Do you guys, do you say SNES or do you say SNES?

151
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,450
Snish.

152
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,110
I feel silly saying snish.

153
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,690
Snish.

154
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,630
Snush.

155
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,770
Sush.

156
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,410
Snish.

157
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,610
Snish.

158
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,230
Snish.

159
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,550
Snish.

160
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,990
Sniz.

161
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,250
Both.

162
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,350
Both.

163
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,830
I say Super Nintendo.

164
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,150
Okay, fancy pants.

165
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,070
Super Nintendo.

166
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,670
S-N-E-S.

167
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,110
You have room in your mouth for two more syllables.

168
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,470
Lucky you.

169
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,270
Lucky you.

170
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,390
It's the full cover of it name.

171
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:04,970
I know.

172
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,990
Super Nintendo.

173
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,350
What is it?

174
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,410
Is it Super Nintendo Entertainment System?

175
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,510
S-N.

176
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,390
That's what I'm guessing is the last two.

177
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,270
That would be the full government name.

178
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,570
Okay, oh my gosh, I guessed that.

179
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,450
Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

180
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,870
You get your butt over here right now.

181
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,690
Super Nintendo, yeah.

182
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,030
Super Nintendo.

183
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,490
Slapp's mouth, this baby can fit so many syllables.

184
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,270
Sufami to tick off the nod weeps.

185
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,910
Wait.

186
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,910
Okay, so this is, this is, I, I, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm
a, I'm a young 19 forever.

187
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,710
But, Famicom, wait, are they different?

188
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,350
Wait.

189
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,710
Are they different?

190
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,710
Actually, I have no idea.

191
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,570
The Famicom and that.

192
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,670
Oh, they are.

193
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,270
Oh, it's S, N, wait, it's N E.

194
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,430
Wait, what's the NES?

195
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,050
Famicom is the original.

196
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,850
I'm such a fake fan, aren't I?

197
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,210
I did not have so much Nintendo.

198
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,290
I didn't even have a N64, so...

199
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,680
Before the SNES.

200
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,180
Super free Nintendo, or was it free Super Nintendo?

201
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
Not free.

202
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,440
Famicom is...

203
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,840
NES?

204
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,680
Super Famicom.

205
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,860
Is SNES.

206
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,120
Ah, okay.

207
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,340
CS, I always get confused.

208
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,280
Why can't they just like...

209
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,100
Why couldn't they call it the Famicom overseas too?

210
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,920
Right?

211
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,880
Confusing.

212
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,700
My brain.

213
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,200
You know what Nintendo should do?

214
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,260
They should go back to their roots and release cards.

215
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,460
Release a deck of cards again.

216
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,320
NES, SNES, 64 GameCube, and so on.

217
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,900
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

218
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,900
Famicom sounds cool.

219
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,480
I think so too, right?

220
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,560
It's like, why don't we like...

221
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Oh, sorry, that was my controller disconnecting.

222
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,740
I...

223
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,200
We knew it wasn't a family computer.

224
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,540
But...

225
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
I guess that's true.

226
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,860
Wait.

227
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,340
I...

228
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,460
I feel like...

229
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,520
Sometimes, though, like...

230
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,340
Why don't we shorten some things similarly to how Japanese
do like aircon?

231
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:08,060
I feel like we could totally I'm always like oh, yeah, turn
on the air conditioner You know or something But I feel like

232
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:19,420
I could say aircon Instead, it's the same thing Famicom is
what Otakon would have been if he was a Ryu 2 Oh!

233
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,370
AC!

234
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,810
DC!

235
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,010
What does AC DC stand for?

236
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,770
I'm asking so I feel like I'm five years old.

237
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,270
I feel like I was born yesterday right now.

238
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,630
What's wrong with me?

239
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,220
We called the Famicom family down here.

240
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,060
SNES were almost non-existent so I never found out how we
called them.

241
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,180
Oh, interesting.

242
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,840
Alternating.

243
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,900
Alternating current, direct current.

244
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,060
Why don't we call it the...

245
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,780
Oh yeah, my favorite band, Alternating current, direct
current.

246
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,020
I'm five years old!

247
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,440
Insert Densetsu cord dense sticker here.

248
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,920
I am not afraid to ask questions, okay?

249
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,940
And I think everybody should also feel that way.

250
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,000
Otacon voice, what's wrong with AC?

251
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,380
Otakon was named after a U.S.

252
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,240
anime convention.

253
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,300
No, he's not.

254
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,280
No, he's not.

255
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,800
The video game crash caused by Atari.

256
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,620
Families were wearing a video game, so they named it the
Nintendo Entertainment System to ease consumers.

257
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,660
Wait, that's so crazy.

258
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,340
Huh.

259
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,720
So there was like a bit of a story behind it.

260
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,340
Interesting.

261
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:15,600

What?

264
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,620
It's even funnier how they pronounce Eminem?

265
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,980
How do they pronounce Eminem?

266
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,220
How do they pronounce Eminem then?

267
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,330
I can't wait.

268
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,250
I-Mu-Nimu?

269
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,310
E-M-N-M-N-M-E-M-E-M?

270
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,890
Everybody's giving me different answers.

271
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,770
Oh my gosh, wait.

272
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,450
I remembered yesterday.

273
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,210
I was talking about phones and stuff.

274
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,950
I just thought of this.

275
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,150
Because I was thinking of it earlier too.

276
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,310
There was a phone that I talked about yesterday.

277
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,410
If you didn't see the stream, that's totally okay.

278
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,370
But it was a phone that is like coming out that is a square
phone.

279
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:33,530
Like apparently more like phones the size of like cards and
stuff are like square cards are kind of becoming popular,

280
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:33,910
right?

281
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,330
And it was called the eco.

282
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,370
Wait...

283
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,590

284
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,770

Iko 1 mind, I think?

287
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,900
But it has...

288
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,060
Yabloko Maloko?

289
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080

290
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,380

293
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,370

294
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,630
That's one.

296
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,770
Sorry, I just remembered it, so I wanted to talk.

297
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,930
I wanted, because yesterday I couldn't remember what the
name of it was, and nobody said it in chat, so I couldn't be

298
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,850
like, that's the one, that's the one.

299
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,890
Ikaam bokaam.

300
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,290
Ikaam.

301
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:32,890
Ikaam.

302
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,530
Ikaam.

303
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,310
Oh my gosh.

304
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,350
If you remember Ikaam, you're definitely unc.

305
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,610
You're VTuber unc.

306
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,090
Well, Junior, someone bet you breakfast?

307
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,090
Oh no, oh no!

308
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,090
I don't, I don't make the rule, sorry.

309
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,850
It felt like it was just yesterday, I know.

310
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,290
I too remember when the Wii-Hoo was invented.

311
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:13,470
Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan, Ikan.

312
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,510
Shall we get into Alan Wake now?

313
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,650
I'll quit yapping.

314
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:21,890
But I...

315
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,010
Wait.

316
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,870
Hello, controller?

317
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,810
Okay, there we go.

318
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,030
Okay.

319
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,310
Because it's going to be a bit longer.

320
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,190
We're trying to get through two chapters today.

321
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,250
So, let's do it.

322
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,150
Let's get through it.

323
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,370
Let's wake up.

324
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,150
Alan, wake up!

325
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,230
Alan, go!

326
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:43,950
Previously on Alan Wake, under the influence of the dark
presence, I wrote a horror story.

327
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,770
story that is coming true yeah jagger had been my editor
making sure that the unfolding story would make her more and

328
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:55,470

my escape into the story together we can create something

Thomas said so.

338
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,910
He wrote it.

339
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,750
The key is insurance.

340
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,150
It's my job to keep it safe.

341
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,630
Safe in the light.

342
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,630
Oh, it's in the light.

343
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,990
Phil, thank you so much for the funding you did.

Thank you, thank you.

346
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,100
All the manuscript pages were gone.

347
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh, my God.

348
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,480
The FBI agent had taken them.

349
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,380
I think my tongue just took a crap in my mouth.

350
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:18,880
How?

351
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,120
Wait, we're in jail now?

352
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
Uh, Al.

353
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,100
Al, this is not good.

354
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,900
Oh, Al.

355
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,280
Oh, nothing came out.

356
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,380
I am never drinking again.

357
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,800
Oh, Al.

358
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,560
I need to talk to Weaver.

359
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
She's the one in the song.

360
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,860
The lady of the light.

361
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
Yeah, that's right.

362
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,780
The lady of the light.

363
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,920
The lady who's obsessed with the lamps and stuff.

364
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,140
Whatever you say, Al, but we're stuck here.

365
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
They're not gonna...

366
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,140
I had some reading to do first, Sheriff.

367
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,320
And let me tell you, it was an interesting read.

368
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,960
Well, I've got you now, Raymond Chandler.

369
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,020
It's all here.

370
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,660
All the evidence, including conspiracy to murder a federal
agent.

371
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,760
There's no way you're walking out of here.

372
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,520
You hear me in there, Brett Easton Ellis?

373
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,580
This guy sucks.

374
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,900
He's so annoying.

375
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Yeah, Alan's stuck.

376
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
Well, we all want things, Sheriff.

377
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,100
I wanted my...

378
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,520
Look, why is he freaking out like this?

379
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Agent Nightingale, I insist.

380
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:29,900
Whoa.

381
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,920
Wake, what's wrong?

382
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Lady, are you stupid?

383
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,400
It's a trick.

384
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,660
It's an obvious trick.

385
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,320
Okay, I've had enough of this crap.

386
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,340
Wake, I'm going to trust you with this.

387
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,140
You're joking.

388
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:48,060
Agent Nightingale, your opinion would matter more if you
were sober and if I actually believed you were here on

389
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,920
official business.

390
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,940
Oh!

391
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,780
Get back in the cell, Stephen King.

392
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,580
The only way you're leaving this place is over my dead...

393
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,700
Wait a minute.

394
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,380
I know this...

395
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
Oh my god!

396
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,830
He wrote about this!

397
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,110
Light.

398
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,350
We need light.

399
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,170
It's the only way to fight this thing.

400
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,510
In my office.

401
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,610
I've got your things there.

402
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,330
Follow me.

403
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:14,710
Okay.

404
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,250
Oh man.

405
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,270
We're sitting ducks with the lights out.

406
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,950
Stay cool.

407
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,970
I can get the emergency power on.

408
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,350
Okay, we're following.

409
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,490
Okay, wait, don't run so fast, please.

410
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,290
They're scaring me.

411
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,750
They're scaring me, please.

412
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,510
Wait, actually, are there any thermoses?

413
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,050
Oh, Barry is in no rush at all.

414
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,710
This guy is totally cruising.

415
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,070
Thermos!

416
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,050
I knew it was here.

417
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,170
I knew it was here.

418
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,090
I knew it.

419
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,310
Wait a second, what's our man?

420
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,270
Okay, the manuscript that we dropped.

421
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,650
Okay, so much has happened all at once all of a sudden.

422
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,290
Nightingale tried to make sense of the manuscript.

423
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,170
He didn't understand half of it.

424
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,630
But it all ran true.

425
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,070
Impossibly true.

426
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,470
He took out his hip flask when he reached the page that
described how he reached the page that made him take out his

427
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,970
hip flask.

428
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,110
It wasn't the booze that made his mind read.

429
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,710
She took out his hip flask when he reached the page that
described how he reached the page that made him take out his

430
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,730
hip flask.

431
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,470
Least lady nice to me.

432
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,970
I'm Alan Wake and I'm a writer.

433
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:31,730
It took out his hip flask when he reached the page that
described how he reached the page that made him take out his

434
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,010
hip flask.

435
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,570
Alan run on sentence.

436
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,730
Oh, oh my gosh, you guys.

437
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:47,850
There's this.

438
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,630
Okay, I don't know if you guys saw it, but there's this
brand called Huff, I think.

439
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,270
And they have a collab right now with Metal Gear.

440
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,590
And I saw last night before I went to bed that they were
releasing some skateboard decks.

441
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,390
And they looked really, really nice.

442
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,530
But then they also put out clothes.

443
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,850
And I was like, oh, these look so good.

444
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,810
I'm such a sucker for Yoshi Shinkawa art that I was like,
okay, I have to buy a couple shirts.

445
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,950
But what's really funny is on the back of them, I don't know
why this, it's because it's a funny scene.

446
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:30,470
sentence but on the back of the shirts they have like
certain quotes from the game like they're so funny because

447
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:43,410
it's like okay hold on let me just like there's like really
huge text and also just like really funny lines like there's

448
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:50,530
a gray fox shirt and it's just like on the back it's like
huge like graphic design is my passion text it says neither

449
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:57,170

meaningless and I'm just like this is this is so awesome for

was another one there's like a there's like a bunch I

452
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:25,830
recommend looking at the they're kind of pricey because it's
you know a it's like a special brand but they have like a

453
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:33,250
they have like a mgs2 hoodie and on the back it has like the
the human race will probably come to an end sometime and new

454
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:39,190
species may rule over this planet earth may not be forever
but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of

455
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:45,470
life we can building the future and keeping the past alive
are one and the same thing and i'm like i want it so bad

456
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:56,530

like huge text it's so awesome if i wore hoodies i would

sitting in a throne shirt i don't know about that wait like

458
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,930
like a porcelain throne

459
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,720
nightingale felt the situation veering out of his control
but the gun at least felt steady in his hands he was ready

460
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:29,740
to fire resolved that he would let this happen over his dead
body and yet he he had seen this moment before read it in

461
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:36,920
the page he was transfixed by the deja vu and the horror
that he was a character in a story someone had written and

462
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:43,440
the monstrous presence bursting behind him and dragged him
into the night what an idiot this guy had a literal

463
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:55,100
walkthrough and still didn't realize about the the monstrous
presence the darkness coming in what a dummy he literally

464
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,280
had the script in him Oh my gosh.

465
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,400
Bear, are you good?

466
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,360
Sorry for the little thing about Metal Gear shirts.

467
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,700
It was just...

468
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,480
Pick up a flare.

469
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,140
Uh-oh.

470
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380
More flares.

471
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,000
Uh-oh, that means I can get hurt without my police friend.

472
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,200
Oh, I'm on the desk.

473
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,880
I was like, what's this out?

474
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm so glad you picked up on how much of a hack writer Alan
is.

475
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,840
Yeah.

476
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,540
Guy is silly.

477
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,620
Alright, let's go.

478
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,380
Oh.

479
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,960
Holy cow.

480
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,040
Where did she go?

481
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,640
In here?

482
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,140
The meeting room?

483
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,440
Oh.

484
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,300
Oh, geez.

485
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,440
She scared me.

486
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,460
Is this going to be like a...

487
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:48,800
Barry?

488
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,740
Barry, I need you over here.

489
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Oh, okay.

490
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,040
I was going to say like a protect her while she turns the
lights back on kind of moment.

491
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
It says follow Sarah, but I think she's following me.

492
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,940
You have my stuff in your room, didn't you say?

493
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,890
Oh.

494
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,150
Okay.

495
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,930
It's so awkward.

496
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,470
Here are your things.

497
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,890
Wake, what do I need to know?

498
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,050
What do you need from me?

499
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,030
They can be hurt in the light, only in the light.

500
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,550
And I need to find Cynthia Weaver.

501
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,290
She can help me stop this.

502
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,550
It's a canon event.

503
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:28,930
Light.

504
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,710
Check.

505
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,490
Cynthia, she lives in the old decommissioned power plant.

506
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:33,850
Why?

507
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,270

Night Springs, okay?

00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,890
Arm to the teeth.

520
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,610
For real.

521
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,630

Gotcha.

523
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,870
Oh, hey, that radio guy is on the list.

Main.

525
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,610
Who's Frank Breaker?

526
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,490
He related to you?

527
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,670
My dad.

528
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,330
Oh.

529
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:29,790

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,170
You'll be safe here.

533
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,370
The backup power's on.

Oh, check it out.

545
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,030
Whatever took Nightingale must have broken the gate
controls.

546
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,850
We can't reach the gate's control box from here.

547
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,030
We need to get to the other side over the rooftop.

548
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:03,590
Awesome.

549
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,090
I'll go.

550
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,150
I'll open the gate for you once I'm across.

551
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,670
You stay here in the light and cover me, Sheriff, okay?

552
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:09,990
Are you sure?

553
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:10,890
Okay, then.

554
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,470
But hurry.

555
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,330
Oh.

556
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,390
Okay.

557
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:26,830
I did see okay, I remember trying to get up this ladder
before and now it's highlighted so I can still hear him say

558
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,450
hi Barry Wheeler

559
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:43,130
Barry Barry Barry I needed to reach the rooftop to get to
the other side of the broken gate Okay, okay Wheeler

560
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,450
Wheeler.

561
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,570
Wheeler.

562
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,650
Wheeler.

563
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,690
Oh.

564
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,290
What's the shining stuff?

565
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:00,850
Oh!

566
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:02,670
Oh!

567
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,930
It's the doo-doo.

568
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,590
Oh, gosh!

569
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,670
I almost stepped in it!

570
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,750
Oh my god!

571
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,050
Any more of it?

572
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,370
Hidden around in here?

573
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,950
Not the doo-doo.

574
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:20,770
Yeah.

575
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:28,050
though come on oh yes I can finally use it yes let's go

576
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,980

577
00:40:42,860 --> 00:41:00,600

Alan clean that is that's terrifying there's

578
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,120
some more right here I think I gotta be closer.

579
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,300
Oh dear.

580
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,080
Dear Festival.

581
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,360
Dear Festival goes hard.

582
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,260
I wonder if I dropped like if I could just run around town.

583
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,340
Wait, I could just like reach the other side from here.

584
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,160
Easy peasy.

585
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,260
In light you can hurt them.

586
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,320
Yeah, we know, we know.

587
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,200
Lights in this game are, like, very specific, I feel.

588
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,900
Wait, there was a door downstairs.

589
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,300
Do you think I should go to it real quick?

590
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,820
I don't know what I think about.

591
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,740
Oh, I just reached the checkpoint.

592
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,740
I didn't get a good look at the deer.

593
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,880
You want to see it?

594
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,540
It's right there.

595
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,520
Why didn't he just climb the gate?

596
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,640
He is a rider.

597
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,300
He is not an ideas man.

598
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,240
Please understand.

599
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,680
There it is.

600
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,620
There's...

601
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,100
It looks even worse in the light.

602
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,480
Oh dear, oh dear.

603
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,560
I do really love how, like, the town looks in this game,
though.

604
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,280
Sorry, I know I'm backtracking a little bit.

605
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,400
I just want to make sure there's nothing that I miss in this
room over here.

606
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,840
Because it was lit up.

607
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,560
I imagine then that means we can go in there.

608
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,220
I just don't want to really get ambushed.

609
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:45,740
Watch.

610
00:42:45,740 --> 00:43:03,580
is locked i knew it was gonna be locked oh my god okay game
i i i i get it i know your i know your tricks now hold on

611
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:21,420
alan locked what the heck i feel something tickling my arm
maybe you come back through there maybe maybe right

612
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,710
map in general is so beautiful.

613
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,710
It's like so nice looking.

614
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:38,050
I just think it's very funny that like whoa that like
they're like you're safe in the light but this game is very

615
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,870
bright and also like light is extremely concentrated.

616
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:56,580
Like like I'm not I'm not safe there right there but I'm
safe right there, you know what I mean?

617
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,900
Sequel gets much darker.

618
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,020
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

619
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,100
Just from what I've seen of screenshots.

620
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,140
Exciting.

621
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,820
Spooky.

622
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:12,580
Scary.

623
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,380
Oh, there's more.

624
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,840
Oh, it's ambushing.

625
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,860
Ambush me.

626
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,100
Come on.

627
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:27,700
Come on.

628
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,020
Yep, up.

629
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,800
Nice.

630
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,600
All right.

631
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,060
Don't fall.

632
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,140
Alan fall.

633
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,100
Okay.

634
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,680
Now my...

635
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,070
I was like, I think I'm going to get ambushed here, so I
want to have my...

636
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,450
No coming at once!

637
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,960
Nice.

638
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,760
Okay.

639
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:33,960
jeez louise I think you can dodge the birds too that would
make sense it's okay though they give an audio cue when

640
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:44,480
they're about to like getcha getcha it's just when they all
come at once it's a little scary but we're good suddenly

641
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:52,580
birds just Alan wake things can I make that am I supposed to
climb on... No.

642
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,780
I'm supposed to jump?

643
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,620
Okay.

644
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,260
Oh, nice.

645
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,680
Alan, jump.

646
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,920
Hey, Sheriff.

647
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,060
Your password.

648
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,920
Night Springs?

649
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,200
What's that all about?

650
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,960
It's a stupid joke we have.

651
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,080
That Bright Falls is the original inspiration for the TV
show.

652
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,700
This town can get weird at times.

653
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,140
Never this weird.

654
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:33,340

657
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,880
Wait a second.

658
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,420
Madam.

659
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,830
Oh yeah.

660
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,090
Why?

661
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,390
Okay.

662
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,450
Where'd she go?

663
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,350
Okay.

664
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:06,170
Ouch!

665
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,030
It's smart.

666
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,090
He's so stupid!

667
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,380
Yeah!

668
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,980
Oh, you missed?

669
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,240
Oh, you missed?

670
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,100
Yeah.

671
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,080
Whoa, shoot.

672
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,780
Riddle!

673
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,340
Good job, Sheriff.

674
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,720
Alan Dodge.

675
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,680
He's so good at that.

676
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,860
Oh, am I still going?

677
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,120
I'm following you, Sarah.

678
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,960
That's what my objective says.

679
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,520
To follow you.

680
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:00,600
Ma'am.

681
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,300
Ma'am.

682
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:03,740
Ma 'am.

683
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,060
Oh.

684
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,720
Okay.

685
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,730
Follow Sarah.

686
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,510
Okay.

687
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,450
I guess we're going through.

688
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:25,510
Right?

689
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,530
Sarah?

690
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,530
I'll walk too.

691
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,210
I'm scared.

692
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,270
It's quite foggy out.

693
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,590
It's really a silent hill here.

694
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,470
Oh my god, the deer!

695
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,160
Oh, whoa.

696
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,420
Uh, light it!

697
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,670
Holy cow.

698
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,560
Ow, I tried to dodge but I was reloading at the same time!

699
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,700
Yeah, stay back!

700
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,520
Dummy.

701
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,760
Nice.

702
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,900
Boom, headshot.

703
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,360
That wasn't a headshot, though.

704
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,340
Is the deer okay?

705
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,990
Alan bonked.

706
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,910
Every time he gets bonked, he has an idea for another story.

707
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,130
Where is she going?

708
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:37,370
Okay.

709
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,570
Let's just push that into the ocean.

710
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,550
Sure.

711
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,350
Sure.

712
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,170
Oh.

713
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:45,850
More?

714
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:46,770
Oh.

715
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:55,410
She doesn't know that I have to, I have to take out their,
uh, their light, their shields first with the light.

716
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,470
Come on, Sarah.

717
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,050
I gotta take it out first.

718
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,050
Wait, there's gotta be a thermos around here.

719
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,250
Hold on, Sarah.

720
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,070
Is the diner open?

721
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:06,590
Oh.

722
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,430
Oh.

723
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:08,850
Oh.

724
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,330
Oh.

725
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,290
Visual, visual glitch.

726
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:14,070
No way it is.

727
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,940
Don't I already have a heavy duty?

728
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,690
Oh no, I guess not.

729
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,710
It felt like I did.

730
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,270
Revolver ammo, revolver ammo.

731
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,170
Nice.

732
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,630
I don't want to go back there, though.

733
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,110
I'm scared.

734
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,850
I don't want to go back there.

735
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,090
Batteries.

736
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:38,870
Oh, she came in.

737
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,650
I'm going to want explanations, you know.

738
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,990
For example, what the hell happened to Rose?

739
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,670
She's seriously messed up now.

740
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,390
I don't know.

741
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:45,970
No, that's not mean.

742
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,070
The same thing I think happened to me after I arrived.

743
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,510
During this week you can't remember?

744
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,250
Oh, I remember now.

745
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,350
Oh.

746
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,650
I remember now.

747
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,490
Can we go in the kitchen?

748
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:01,530
Staff only?

749
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,550
Wait, we could use the jukebox still?

750
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,020
The lime and the coconut.

751
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,740
We put the lime and the coconut.

752
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,020

All right, we'll follow.

758
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,920
I like having Sarah on my side, though.

759
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,600
This is awesome.

760
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,340
She alerts me when guys are coming.

761
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,780
She's really strong.

762
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,080
Oh!

763
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:11,840

00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,620
Competent NPCs.

765
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,580
We'd love to see it.

766
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,580
Oh, okay, I've reached my...

767
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:21,980
Oh, 20.

768
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,860
I've reached my limit.

769
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:23,820
Oh, wow.

770
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,300
Why are they set up like this?

771
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,040
Oh my god!

772
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:32,720

I was like, why isn't he not dying?

780
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:10,160
Silly Sarah doesn't know how to focus her flashlight,
obviously.

781
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,440
Is she in the body?

782
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:11,960
No.

783
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,240
Where'd she go?

784
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,420
There she is.

785
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,040
Anybody else in the body?

786
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,540
Sarah awake.

787
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,120
Sarah's strong.

788
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,880
Hey, Sarah.

789
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,380
Oh, okay.

790
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,380
Wait.

791
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:34,660
Mate!

792
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,920
Oh, okay.

793
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,320
Just kidding.

794
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,650
Okay.

795
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,990
Oh.

796
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:45,650
Evil?

797
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,570
Evil barrel?

798
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,990
Evil car?

799
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,170
Sarah?

800
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:52,950
I'm scared.

801
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,450
Sarah the ambiance.

802
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,710
It's like a zombie game all of a sudden or something, it
feels.

803
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,330
There's light.

804
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:04,170
There is?

805
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,250

00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,530
Oh, true, true, true.

809
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,070
Oh, no, no, no.

00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,050
Oh, no, no, no.

811
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,230
How long does it take to unlock a gate?

812
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,230
Oh, shoot.

813
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,860
How long does it take to unlock a gate?

814
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,160
That's all I gotta ask.

815
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,180
Oh, no, you don't.

816
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,080
Oh,

817
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,420

818
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,540
She's so awesome.

819
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,040

Ow!

824
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,150
I knew that was coming.

825
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,070
I saw it too.

826
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,350
Whoops!

827
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,890
You can kill him now!

828
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:38,510
Oh.

829
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,540
Oh, nice.

830
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,500
We got his ass.

831
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,320
Nice.

832
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,200
Yeah, he just tossed a knife at me.

833
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,840
They do that.

834
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,780
Just...

835
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,820

box here but you should be able to jury rig it while I find

841
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,780
the keys jury got electrocuted once today how about I look
for the keys and you get burned for a Okay.

842
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,440
They should be in the clerk's office on the other side of
the building near the main entrance.

843
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,560
That sounds really far.

844
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,480
Find the helicopter key.

845
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,260
Is it?

846
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,100
Isn't it Jerry rig?

847
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,900
She said Jerry rig.

848
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:23,680
Oh.

849
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,680
Jerry rig is apparently the proper way to say it, but
everyone says Jerry rig.

850
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,780
Oh, no way!

851
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,300
Is that so?

852
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,480
Okay.

853
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,560
to checkpoint.

854
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,980
And there's a manuscript.

855
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,000
Uh-oh.

856
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:47,100
It's going to say, while he's inside, about to grab the
keys, he gets the biggest ambush of his life, and it makes

857
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,460
him have to poo-poo his pants.

858
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,280
So embarrassing.

859
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,380
The darkness that wore Barbara Jagger's face was furious.

860
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,140
The story in the manuscript had been making it stronger all
the time.

861
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,760
It's like, Helen, why'd you write that?

862
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,460
She set the lighter free and heard it.

863
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,280
Weakened it.

864
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,340
It was only a matter of days before the dark presence would
be strong again.

865
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,720
But meanwhile, it would be difficult to recapture the
writer.

866
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,180
Oh.

867
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:19,260
It's like, can you imagine just him writing like the most
off, like the craziest thing?

868
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:26,440
It's just like, and then everybody realizes that the things
that he wrote were the things that are coming true.

869
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,340
And then they just kind of were like, Alan, why did you
write that?

870
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,800
Why did you, why did you write that?

871
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,320
It's like,

872
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:41,240
the story in the manuscript had been making it stronger all
this time but now the light had set the writer free and

873
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:52,700
heard it we can do sorry i wasn't paying attention it was
only a matter of days before okay okay uh she said on the

874
00:58:52,700 --> 00:59:04,640
other side of the building hall records i'm guessing it's in
here oh moshi moshi The message was from Barry.

875
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,660
He was getting worried at the station.

876
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,240
He wanted us to hurry.

877
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,220
I'm worried for you too.

878
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,380
Don't worry, buddy.

879
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,080
Wait, hold on.

880
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,600
I do want to go upstairs, though.

881
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,400
The power went to his head, okay?

882
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,400
Clearly.

883
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,220
The keys aren't upstairs, wake.

884
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,200
I'm just going to take a quick look.

885
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,040
Jeez.

886
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,940
I'm just looking.

887
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,960
Can't the guy be curious?

888
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,020
I'm just a little curious.

889
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,440
And who knows?

890
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,280
Maybe someone moved them.

891
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,680
Oh, what are yous?

892
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,300
Night Springs!

893
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,420
A fusion of vigilance, conscience, and uncompromising
clarity of vision.

894
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,980
A need so fundamental.

895
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,440
iPad kid, iPad kid.

896
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,300
And yet, a man may be brought to his knees in a single
heartbeat.

897
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,240
In Night Springs.

898
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,280
Nice.

899
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah, get your popcorn, guys.

900
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:06,840
Oh!

901
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,620
For young Manny, the knight hasn't been kind.

902
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,160
He's a marked man.

903
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,860
Selected for a lifetime of certitude after answering an ad
in the newspaper.

904
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,940
But first, a little field surgery is required.

905
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,020
I bet recording these were so fun.

906
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
Wow, wow, wow.

907
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,080
Wow, wow.

908
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,160
Yeah, I think you're just about ready for it.

909
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,460
Just if you don't resist this kid, we gotta beat it out of
you.

910
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:39,920
What?

911
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,960
I don't understand.

912
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,100
What did I do?

913
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,300
I just wanted to get a job in the service industry.

914
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,200
Wow, you're gonna serve alright.

915
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,780
Go, ah, go, please!

916
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,940
Ooh, ah, oh god, ah!

917
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
It's coming out now.

918
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,840
Right between the self-esteem and the childhood traumas.

919
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,560
What are you doing to me?

920
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,420
It's Mormon.

921
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,800
There, I've got it.

922
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,280
Oh my god!

923
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,600
What was that?

924
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:18,580
Whoa.

925
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,540
Nothing for you to worry about, Manny.

926
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,620
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

927
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,360
We'll tell you all about that.

928
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,960
Don't you worry.

929
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,880
Ouchie, ouchie.

930
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,080
You're so excited to serve.

931
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:40,280
Stranger Ant, birthed in fury and violence for the pleasure
and convenience of ruthless and malicious men.

932
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,520
Stranger Things.

933
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,280
In night springs.

934
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:53,520
Did you guys hear about how apparently the Duffer brothers,
the guys who wrote Stranger Things, were inspired by Elphin

935
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:53,840
Lead?

936
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:55,860
Oh.

937
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,680
Why did that fall over?

938
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,540
That's so scary.

939
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,280
Wait, why did it fall over like that?

940
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,160
That's so scary.

941
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,400
The darkness controls the Taken.

942
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,900
Yeah, for the series.

943
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,500
Yeah, yeah.

944
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:22,080
If you think about it, if you think about it, a girl in a
lab with, like, psychokinetic kind of powers is, like,

945
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,280
experimented on and escapes.

946
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:31,220
And you kind of, like, it kind of makes sense.

947
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:32,820
Yeah.

948
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,240
That's Lucy, yeah.

949
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,100
It's very funny because, like, a bunch of the people that
don't like the ending of...

950
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,360
Oh!

951
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,200
My gosh.

952
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,320
A lot of the people that don't like the ending of the
Stranger Things show are, like, clowning on the fact that

953
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,780
they were inspired by the anime.

954
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,780
Did I get it?

955
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,340
I got it all?

956
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:05,960
Okay, awesome.

957
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,360
Surprise!

958
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:18,540
ceiling man oh he came from the roof wow sunroof they should
get that fixed yikes alright what if it rains all these

959
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,540
documents oh my gosh imagine the mold

960
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:37,900
and not even a good anime I heard that the manga and then
there's also because like in the anime Lucy has like a with

961
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,820
like a clock, a grandfather clock.

962
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:45,380
And then there's a character in Stranger Things that like
has clocks as his imagery.

963
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,420
But apparently it was all for nothing.

964
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,680
The imagery was like just because they liked the clock in
Elfin League.

965
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,620
Eleven's first scene is almost shot for shot.

966
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,560
A toned down version of Lucy's first scene.

967
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,700
No way!

968
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,360
Is it?

969
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:11,660
to be fair young girl with psychic powers escapes government
facility and finds a lover and friends to fight super demons

970
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:18,120
with is a very anime trope it very is yeah

971
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:35,760
okay now that we know this building has sunroofs oh my gosh
where'd you go where'd you go there was another guy wasn't

973
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:07,660
well um i forgot to pick that up oh my gosh it's so dark
these flashlights are so bad.

974
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,380
Checking around, making sure I got it all.

975
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,240
Now let's go into his room too.

976
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,480
Oh, there's stuff.

977
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,240
Hunting rifle!

978
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,580
Wait, but I do like my pump, my shotgun.

979
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,240
I don't know.

980
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,000
I think I really like the hunting rifle too though.

981
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,600
I think I remember liking both.

982
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,980
Copy, there was...

983
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,420
Nice.

984
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,900
I can't see anything.

985
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,080
It's so bad.

986
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,160
That's what I mean.

987
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,280
The light in this game is so concentrated.

988
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,000
They're both solid.

989
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:02,980
Yeah, okay.

990
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,780
Of course we're going into the light that I said I did
not...

991
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,400
Or the room...

992
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,380
Why did the...

993
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,200
Why did that just shut?

994
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,040
Why did that door just shut?

995
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:13,520
On its own?

996
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:18,610
Why did it do that?

997
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:24,570
Flashbang!

998
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,710
They're like, get the key and then get ambushed.

999
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:32,150
Dummy.

1000
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:33,930
You know what?

1001
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,550
I will have my flashbang at the ready.

1002
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:39,790
Oh gosh!

1003
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,670
My thermost favorite streamer!

1004
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,370
Yeah, we're getting a ton of stuff.

1005
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,070
Oh gosh, I'm so scared.

1006
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:53,970
Alright, but we have to do it.

1007
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:54,950
Three, two, one, go!

1008
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,030
Okay, Sheriff.

1009
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,090
I got the keys.

1010
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,790
Sheriff?

1011
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,150
Sheriff answer me.

1012
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,130
Leave town hall.

1013
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:13,550
Oh, my gosh.

1014
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,290
Seriously?

1015
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,090
Wait.

1016
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,230
Barry?

1017
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,930
Why isn't he inside?

1018
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:23,390
Oh, God.

1019
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,590
Oh, God.

1020
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:48,180
he made it inside wake he's okay but it's dark in there we

1023
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,220
i saw a manuscript page I see nothing.

1024
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,500
Just doing a little bit of exploration.

1025
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,090
No, you can't.

1026
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,110
Absolutely, no, you can't.

1027
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,470
You're so right.

1028
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:26,210
I'm stupid.

1029
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,230
You're so right.

1030
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,110
I'm like the dummy dumb here.

1031
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,210
There's no way we could climb over this and then...

1032
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,310
Yeah, I'm an idiot.

1033
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:34,930
I'm an idiot.

1034
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,630
You're so right.

1035
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,390
Whoa.

1036
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,930
Whoa, freaky park.

1037
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,530
What the heck is this?

1038
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:46,870
I want to read it?

1039
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:54,090
It's not recorded when Bright Falls was first formed as a
nameless trading post, but it became a town when the Bright

1040
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,430
Falls mining company started to operate nearby in 1878.

1041
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:05,890
It was then that Hubert Biltmore, a fur trapper, and Amos
Gunderson, a pioneer from Tacoma, decided to build a post

1042
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:09,450
office, saloon, and hotel, all operating from the same
building.

1043
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,970
Stop overestimating Alan's physical capabilities.

1044
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,210
He's a writer, not an Olympic athlete.

1045
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:16,530
You're so right.

1046
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:22,030
It was through the efforts of these two men that the Bright
Falls became...

1047
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,570
Oh, that Bright Falls became the permanent and thriving town
it is today.

1048
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:26,370
Aww.

1049
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:28,530
Oh.

1050
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,550
Yellow.

1051
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,370
Trust no one in the dark.

1052
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:35,430
Okay.

1053
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:36,650
Oh.

1054
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:38,450
Did I see it?

1055
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:39,450
Sorry.

1056
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,230
I keep thinking.

1057
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,790
Okay, maybe it's not just me.

1058
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,630
I keep thinking I'm seeing things, like shining.

1059
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,090
Watch out.

1060
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,770

01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,400
And also, I will switch back to my hunting rifle.

1106
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,200
I wish I thought for a second that there was hunting rifle
ammo.

1107
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,020
A little sad there's not.

1108
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,660

1110
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,680

What's it called in this game?

1121
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,600
The voices are very quiet and the...

1122
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,220
Um...

1123
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:25,660
The voices are very quiet, but the, uh, the shooting is very
loud, so I'm sorry.

1124
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,340
Ooh, they're giving us a lot of stuff.

1125
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:35,760
Marties!

1126
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,220

1127
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:39,760

1128
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:40,760
Really?

1129
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,960
Am I gonna have to defend her as she opens the church?

1130
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,320
Is that gonna be it?

1131
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,620
Hold on, let's make sure we got everything.

1132
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,000

1133
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,640
Hold on.

1134
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,400
What's going on in the church?

1135
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,600

1136
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,280

01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,060

1142
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,280
So romantic.

1143
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,840
The Presbyterian Choir of Watery Visit, September 8th, 28th.

1146
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,200
feet inside the Bright Falls general store and off.

1147
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,460
Right next to the cans of baked beans was a locked case
filled with flare guns.

1148
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:55,980
Oh, nice.

1149
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,960
And yet here was a conveniently placed barrel of crow bars.

1150
01:16:59,280 --> 01:16:59,360
Nice.

1151
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:05,240
Barry's smile widened as he realized that this was the
classic movie scene where the hero had to gear up and arm

1152
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,180
himself to the teeth.

1153
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,480
Barry threw himself into the roll.

1154
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,500
Let's go, Barry Pro Tag!

1155
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,560
Barry Pro Tag moment!

01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,140
What does it say?

1157
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,600
Wake and Sheriff Breaker have to meet up with Barry and then
reach the helicopter.

1158
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:16,860
Okay.

1159
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:21,620
Because we gotta get to the helicopter so we can get to the
Uh...

1160
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,180
Nandake.

1161
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,200
Uh...

1162
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,400
The power plant.

1163
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,840
So that we can then see the lady.

1164
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,640
That's our current objective.

1165
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:36,660
Was that another?

1166
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,960
Oh my gosh, I almost missed this flashbang.

1167
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,320
That would have been huge!

1168
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,100
Are we going in?

1169
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,570
Okay, I'm ready.

1170
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,510
I'm gonna give Pastor Howard a piece of my mind about this
lock.

1171
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,530
I told him to get it fixed.

1172
01:17:59,250 --> 01:17:59,450
Ah.

1173
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,150
Physical labor!

1174
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:07,770
Uh...

1175
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,130
What do we want to do?

1176
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:09,690
Sheriff?

1177
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,490
Oh, here they come.

1178
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:26,550
Physical labor.

1179
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,310
Oh, no, it's one of these guys.

1180
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:34,610
Oh, geez.

1181
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:35,930
Oh, shoot.

1182
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:36,890
Oh shoot.

1183
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:40,870
Ah!

1184
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,240
Uh...

1185
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,540
I'm losing him, I'm losing him.

1186
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,000
Oh my gosh!

1187
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,440
I'm trying!

1188
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,700
There we go.

1189
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:07,640
Oh my gosh.

1190
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,400
This isn't good.

1191
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,900
Ah, nice, nice.

1192
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:17,500
Woo!

1193
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:24,610
Holy cow!

1194
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,350
Survive the assault.

1195
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,650
I'm almost out of bullets.

1196
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:29,930
Uh-oh.

1197
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,930
The bullets.

1198
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:34,950
Okay, it's open.

1199
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:37,370
Yeah.

1200
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:43,170
That took you two seconds after you...

1201
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:43,510
Focus.

1202
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,690
Aww.

1203
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,230
On the night before Deerfest.

1204
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,590
All through the house.

1205
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:57,630
was stirring not not even a rider

1206
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:20,180
well seems kind of dangerous yeah very fire safe exactly
exactly not even a deer make it through the church that

1207
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:25,480
sounds really ominous considering we're almost there we'll
have to go through the basement to get to the parking lot oh

1208
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:29,080
why there's no way going through the Crypt will turn out to
be a bad idea.

1209
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,340
That's what I'm saying.

1210
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,500
Why are we doing that?

1211
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,520
Why are we going through the basement?

1212
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,680
Why is it there?

1213
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:39,500
Okay.

1214
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,820
Let's go.

1215
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:54,720
Come on.

1216
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:55,480
I'm scared.

1217
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,060
Why are we down here?

1218
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,320
What is this?

1219
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,340
Why a red means scary.

1220
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,440
Why is it red over there?

1221
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,040
I need you closer.

1222
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:06,340
What do you mean?

1223
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,160
Sheriff.

1224
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:09,400
Eh.

1225
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,600

1226
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:13,980
Oh, you know what?

1227
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,340
Throw.

1228
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,280
Oh,

1229
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:23,070
they were the big guys too.

1230
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:23,790
I took care of them.

1231
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,770
Nice.

1232
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,970
That was perfect.

1233
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,720
Alan Flash.

1234
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,080
That was easy peasy.

1235
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:41,390
I hear so many sound effects.

1236
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,010
It's freaking me out.

1237
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:48,070
What is this anyway?

1238
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,970
Oh.

1239
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,710
That's for heat, right?

1240
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,390
Not for burning bodies?

1241
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:55,630
I hope.

1242
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:01,610
I sure hope so.

1243
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,930
Is this also a crematorium?

1244
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,790
That's what I'm saying!

1245
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:09,410
Did you call 911?

1246
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,110
Woo!

1247
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,770
Wait, who did that?

1248
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:15,730
Yes, that was the light.

1249
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:16,570
Barry!

1250
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,510
You didn't like that one?

1251
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:20,670
A tough audience.

1252
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,270
No, it was great!

1253
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,190
I got plenty more.

1254
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:24,930
What are the Christmas lights for?

1255
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,670
Protection, man?

1256
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,570
Like garlic against vampires?

1257
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,950
Yeah, why would you ask that, Alan?

1258
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:30,790
You stupid?

1259
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,570
The helicopter is just across the parking lot and up the
hill.

1260
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,350
Come on!

1261
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,190
Let's go!

1262
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,070
Why would you ask that?

1263
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:44,910
Why are you covered in lights when these are creatures that
are weak to darkness?

1264
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:55,890
I mean, to weak against light stupid what's wrong with you

with work good luck thanks for dropping by thanks for the

1270
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:52,440
super chat I could see my house from here.

1271
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:53,600
All right, hold on.

1272
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,020
What's this?

1273
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,420
What's this page we got going on here?

1274
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,740
Oh, yeah, I missed two, my bad.

1275
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,920
For it to be free, the Dark Presence needed the writer to
finish the story.

1276
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,180
Again and again, the story let it get frustratingly close to
the writer without letting it capture him.

1277
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,160
It was bound by the events depicted in the master.

1278
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,380
Yeah, why didn't anyone use a headlamp until now, actually?

1279
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,520
We could pursue the writer indirectly.

1280
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,760
Put others on the task and stop those who would help him.

1281
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,260
made them its puppets and sent them after Alan Wake.

1282
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:24,940
That done.

1283
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,260
Actually, you know what I would have done?

1284
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:31,340
First of all, if I were buried, I would have gotten an extra
one for me.

1285
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:40,120
Second of all, I mean, I know their headlamps, but if you,
like, strap them to your arms, to your legs, like, on your

1286
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:47,020
butt, everywhere, all over, you could just be like a disco
ball and it would be perfect.

1287
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,460
Oh, he said it was the last one.

1288
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,280
Oh, okay, just kidding.

1289
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:56,480
Alice had screamed until she had no voice left to scream
around her the darkness was alive oh no it was cold and wet

1290
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:04,100
and malevolent and without end she was a prisoner trapped in
the dark place the tarot would have burned her mind out but

1291
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:11,260
one thing made her hang on she could sense Alan in the dark
she could hear him she could see the words he was writing

1292
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:17,700
his flickering shadows he sensed her too he was trying to
work his way to her oh we're gonna be running are we gonna

1293
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:24,580
be in the darkness There's three pages here that we can't
get because hard mode.

1294
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:36,200
We're going up, up, up to the helicopter.

1295
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,760
It's at the top of this hill.

1296
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:39,600
Why?

1297
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:40,380
Why?

1298
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,540
I mean, I don't, I get why it's on the top of the hill,
but...

1299
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:47,680
Someone throws a damn school bus at your head and you're
about to take a helicopter ride with someone who may or may

1300
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,060
not have a pilot's license.

1301
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,740
You're cleared for departure to Night Springs.

1302
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:11,140
one second everybody follow me instead real quick everyone
follow me everyone follow me oh shit oh where

1303
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:27,950
that's why I needed you guys to follow me I've wasted a
bullet no it's one thing about the hunting rifle the

1304
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:32,670
original version of this game there are several ads for
Verizon phones and Energizer batteries, which he used to

1305
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:33,190
power your light.

1306
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,310
The remastered game removed all the traces of the ads.

1307
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,010
Oh, that's funny.

1308
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,230
Timber!

1309
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,270
Oh, geez.

1310
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:50,840
Get the weight.

1311
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:56,780
Oh, gosh.

1312
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,220
Big boy.

1313
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,200
Big boy coming in.

1314
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,520
Ah!

1315
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,720
Holy cow.

1316
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,360
Anyone else?

1317
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,820
Oh, I'm never going to get used to this.

1318
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,380
You're okay, Barry.

1319
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:18,960
You're okay.

1320
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:25,250
I'm going to...

1321
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,880
Switch to my revolver for a bit.

1322
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,500
It's not ideal, but...

1323
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,400
Oh, this is where the lights are!

1324
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,980
What do you mean need a while?

1325
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:42,900
It'll take too long.

1326
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,060
I want to get out of here.

1327
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,200
Yeah.

1328
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,740
What's a while?

1329
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,100
What's a while?

1330
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,480
Can we get, like, a...

1331
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,180
I feel there has to be an Alan Wake Kingdom Hearts crossover
somewhere.

1332
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,340
I don't think that needs to be a thing.

1333
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,320
Oh, see!

1334
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,600
Shotgun ammo?

1335
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,060
Oh, wait.

1336
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:04,860
You know what?

1337
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,380
We'll switch.

1338
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,280
We'll switch to the pump action.

1339
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,500
I think I have so much more shotgun ammo than I do anything
else, so...

1340
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,000
Nice.

1341
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,620
And...

1342
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:19,920
Awesome.

1343
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,120
Oh, we're about to like, we're about to fight.

1344
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,680
We are about to fight.

1345
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,820
Holy cow.

1346
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,840
And I see, okay, there's these.

1347
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,170
And there's also like the explosion barrels.

1348
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:37,810
Okay, okay.

1349
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,150
Um, why aren't you prepping?

1350
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,920
Very, very.

1351
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:55,960
Boss fight!

1352
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:57,440

1359
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:46,250
Pick up the flash.

1360
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,420
Pick up the flare.

1361
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:51,900
Okay.

1362
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,620
Where are they?

1363
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:55,380
More of them?

1364
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,190
Pick up the flare.

1365
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,530
Okay.

1366
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:02,810
Oh,

1367
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:07,110
there's one.

1368
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,540
Oh my gosh.

1369
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,480
Helicopter simultaneously so loud and not so loud.

1370
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,060
I don't.

1371
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,220
I'm doing my best here.

1372
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:41,620
Why don't I have my shotgun?

1373
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:42,340
There we go.

1374
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,120
Oh gosh, okay.

1375
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:53,440
Ha!

1376
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:04,880
Anyone else?

1377
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,080
Trash can attack!

1378
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,860
Rapid, please!

1379
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,800
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1380
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,540
Everything's happening, all outwinds.

1381
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:18,740
Oh!

1382
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,420
How long does it take, ma'am?

1383
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,700
Oh, they're coming for the rooftops.

1384
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:47,220
flashbangs oh did that hurt me oh my gosh where'd you guys
step on me

1385
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:56,360

1387
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:27,360
you better put an end to this just get me to leave her
sheriff you're taking a big chance on a local crazy Lady Al.

1388
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,980
I hope you're right about her, or we could kiss this town
goodbye.

1389
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,960
I think we're the most right about her.

1390
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,580
What other leads are we supposed to go on anyway?

1391
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,300
Yay, we did it!

1392
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:45,720
That wasn't so- that was like the easiest ambush that we've
had, I think.

1393
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,100
I hope you know how to deal with this wake.

1394
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:54,120
I guess you New Yorkers are used to rough situations like
this.

1395
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:03,100
Kong mutant alligators and Alex Casey shoots the place up
every weekend look I never even carried a gun until a couple

01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:11,120
of days ago well my dad used to be a cop there tells some
pretty wild stories stuff like this no no just normal bad

01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:06,210
they're gonna live, right?

1405
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,150
Uh.

1406
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:10,810
Uh.

1407
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:11,710
Uh.

1408
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:18,990
I'll

1409
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,600
get them.

1410
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:40,980
I'll get them.

1411
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,820
I'll get them.

1412
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:43,040
Close.

1413
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,820
Wait, what happened to all my batteries?

1414
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,580
Wait, what happened to all my batteries?

1415
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:53,180
I had like 20!

1416
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,600
Did they fall out of my pocket or something?

1417
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,260
And my flashlight!

1418
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,500
Wait, I have no weapons.

1419
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,660
What happened to all my stuff?

1420
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,380
Excuse me!

1421
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,540
We left them in the chopper.

1422
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,700
No, stinking way!

1423
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,540
Wow, he picked up everything!

1424
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:28,720
I had to do something about the chain for the door to open.

1425
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,620
Ooh, that's kind of spooky the way it's like trying to open
on its own.

1426
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,020
It reminds me of when like, uh...

1427
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:40,620
Oh, great.

1428
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,060
All this revolver ammo for the revolver that I definitely
have.

1429
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:44,560
Oh.

1430
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,080
Yay!

1431
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,720
I ever played Undertaker?

1432
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,520
pale yellow.

1433
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,080
I don't know that game, but I would never say never.

1434
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,340
Sorry, guys.

1435
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,900
I feel something tickling me this entire time.

1436
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,460
I feel like it's like a cat hair.

1437
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,480
I had so much stuff.

1438
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,320
I was completely loaded up on everything.

1439
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,280
And the game took it all from me.

1440
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:20,360
Okay.

1441
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:21,860
Oh.

1442
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:22,720
Oh.

1443
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,640
The darkness wears her face.

1444
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,220
Okay.

1445
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,060
The darkness controls the daikon.

1446
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:34,820
Wait, what am I?

1447
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,560
Am I supposed to shoot this?

1448
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,640
No.

1449
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:42,760
Uh...

1450
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:46,000
Is there like a wire cutter around here?

1451
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:54,800
Each level resets your inventory.

1452
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,720
I didn't realize that...

1453
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,660
But this is...

1454
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,860
Not a new chapter.

1455
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,820
This is not chapter 6, right?

1456
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,560
Like, it's just...

1457
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:10,380
Yeah, it's still chapter 5.

1458
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:12,680
Maybe I do...

1459
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:13,540
Do you think I missed it?

1460
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,110
Let's try.

1461
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,600
Oh, the wood.

1462
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,000
Oh, shoot.

1463
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:30,960
Oh, my God.

1464
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:31,480
Ah!

1465
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,240
Ah!

1466
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,340
Ah!

1467
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,880
I have no flares or anything.

1468
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,400
Oh, my gosh.

1469
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,600
Ah!

1470
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,700
I know I saw...

1471
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:46,580
Um...

1472
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,280
Shit!

1473
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,080
I ran the wrong way.

1474
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,980
Oh my gosh, I'm wasting everything.

1475
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:52,780
Ah!

1476
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,320
God!

1477
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,280
This is terrible.

1478
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,940
Why would you...

1479
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,720
Oh, the light inside!

1480
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,700
You guys are so right.

1481
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,860
I didn't even see it.

1482
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:07,760
I'll be honest.

1483
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,940
I got so hung up on the fact that I was about to get
ambushed.

1484
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,440
Run in and run in and run in and run in and run in.

1485
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,300
Oh, God!

1486
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,380
Oh, it's...

1487
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,490
Oh, please.

1488
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:27,370
Alan, Alan dodge.

1489
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:47,240
Oh, thanks, game.

1490
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:48,960
Really appreciate it.

1491
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,760
Alan, bad knees.

1492
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,080
Alan, roll.

1493
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,280
Alan, Alan do something.

1494
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,640
Alan, Alan.

1495
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,860
Oh, I got some flares.

1496
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,380
Oh, thank goodness.

1497
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:09,580
I realized how truly dependent on everything I am.

1498
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:10,340
Look at this, guys.

1499
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,180
We're not in the woods.

1500
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,420
We're in...

1501
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,660
Industry yard.

1502
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,100
Yeah, we love it.

1503
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,880
They can't...

1504
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,220
The thing is, is, like, they send so many huge guys at me
now.

1505
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:27,440
That it's, like, really difficult to...

1506
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:34,130
to not have more special stuff, you know what I mean?

1507
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,380
Yeah, they're sending huge guys!

1508
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,420
And here's a new song from a band that...

1509
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:51,000
They always remind me of our local rock legends, the old
gods.

1510
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:52,720
Wait, is this DMCA?

1511
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,400
Hugh Morris?

1512
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,120
DMCA free song.

1513
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:57,700
Thank you!

1514
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,780
Perfect.

1515
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,080
Oh, are we gonna have a soundtrack for when we fight the
next guy?

1516
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,120
Ow!

1517
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:07,800
Oh,

1518
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:18,180
nice!

1519
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:34,410
Where'd he go?

1520
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,540
So there's this guy left, right?

1521
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:43,650
Shit.

1522
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,630
I have no more flares.

1523
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:55,690
I'm screwed.

1524
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:56,650
I'm so screwed.

1525
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,810
Oh, I have flares, just kidding.

1526
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:14,250
Oh my gosh, there's so many huge guys.

1527
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:15,210
Please!

1528
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:15,930
Ouch!

1529
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,950
Ouch!

1530
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:17,050
Ouch!

1531
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,550
Ouch!

1532
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:19,530
Oh shit!

1533
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:20,870
Shit!

1534
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:23,310
I'm trying to move.

1535
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,050
Oh my god.

1536
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:26,370
Oh!

1537
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:28,070
Holy!

1538
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:30,350
Holy cow!

1539
01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:32,510
They're like, uh...

1540
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:33,350
Oh my gosh.

1541
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:35,610
The barrel.

1542
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:36,070
What?

1543
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,090
This one right here?

1544
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,340
Wow, that one was tough.

1545
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:48,260
Hmm.

1546
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:48,620
Hmm.

1547
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:49,860
Hmm.

1548
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,020
It's because I only see them sometimes.

1549
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,240
Also, if I'm too close, I'll get hurt too, right?

1550
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,060
That's how I feel.

1551
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,800
Red with the white... I'm not that stupid, you guys!

1552
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,080
I know which ones explode!

1553
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,640
I know which ones!

1554
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,100
Oh my god!

1555
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,860
I know which ones explode!

1556
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,760
I've been shooting them before!

1557
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,600
What the hell?

1558
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:22,240
You guys think I'm actually stupid, I think.

1559
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,620
Oh my god.

1560
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,040
Anyway.

1561
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:47,060
Like I said, the reason I am hesitant about shooting them is
I'm worried about myself exploding.

1562
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,440
But if I am okay, then I guess we'll be okay.

1563
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:52,660
Let's try it.

1564
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,560
What if I don't turn on the music?

1565
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,640
Screw it.

1566
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,320
So if I...

1567
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:01,540
Oh.

1568
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,080
If it didn't lock on him, that would be pretty nice too.

1569
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:05,740
Wait.

1570
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:06,260
Oh.

1571
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,280
But it's kind of like...

1572
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:08,340
Oh.

1573
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:09,520
Yeah.

1574
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:09,900
Okay.

1575
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,420
It's pretty far.

1576
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:10,860
Bro.

1577
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:11,540
Oh my god.

1578
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:30,150
Ah!

1579
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:30,510
Shoot!

1580
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:33,770
Okay.

1581
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:44,970
one second

1582
01:43:51,970 --> 01:44:02,010
don't be mean you guys don't be mean that's all i want to
say hold on trying to find somebody to time you out because

1583
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:02,660
you're being mean

1584
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:16,280
uh I can't find you, but when I find you again, I'll time
you out because you're being mean.

1585
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,740
This is the one of the more annoying fights in the whole
game, so don't worry about it.

1586
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:23,620
Thank you.

1587
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:26,800
Oh, my gosh.

1588
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,680
It's fine.

1589
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,620
I'm not annoyed so far.

1590
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,520
All right, come here.

1591
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,820
Oh, please.

1592
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:38,060
Ah, bam!

1593
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,870
Ah, I'm sure he'll get him.

1594
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,910
Oh, it's too far.

1595
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:43,310
That sucks.

1596
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,710
Oh, whoop!

1597
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,010
Okay.

1598
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,970
Headshot!

1599
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:02,780
I wish I had my lamp.

1600
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:03,740
Shoot.

1601
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,720
Oh, gosh.

1602
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,400
I only have one flare left, though.

1603
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,040
Oh.

1604
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,040
Wait, did I get the other barrel?

1605
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:22,840
Where'd it go?

1606
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,760
Oh, God!

1607
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:25,280
Oh,

1608
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,120
shoot.

1609
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,260
I'm just wasting bullets.

1610
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,760
I get so scared about it!

1611
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,360
Oh my god, please.

1612
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,140
Leave me alone.

1613
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:43,340
I know that I'm shooting them and I'm wasting my ammo,
but...

1614
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,300
The guy tried to throw his...

1615
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:48,680
Please!

1616
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,220
There's so many guys!

1617
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:53,920
I'm trying to dodge.

1618
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,620
I'm trying to dodge to get them more.

1619
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,980
I think there's more items on the other side.

1620
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,920
But getting through them is crazy.

1621
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,980
Like, there's more items over there.

1622
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,580
Actually, that just looks like ammo.

1623
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,600
It doesn't look like flares.

1624
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,700
Yeah, it just looks like ammo.

1625
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,260
Dang it.

1626
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,000
Oh, this one's hard.

1627
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:17,300
No, the stuff on the shelves is what I'm talking about.

1628
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,000
I think it's just ammo, not...

1629
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:21,040
Oh.

1630
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:24,140
Maybe you want a bum rush to the other side.

1631
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:24,840
Let's try that.

1632
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,220
Yeah.

1633
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:27,880
I'm not even going to start these.

1634
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,640
Where does this guy even come from, for real?

1635
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,980
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1636
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,440
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

1637
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:36,120
Oh, my gosh.

1638
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:38,520
Ah, please!

1639
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:38,940
No!

1640
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,220
Okay.

1641
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:49,720
Oh, I see, it does hurt me, but...

1642
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,880
I guess we kind of got that guy.

1643
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:52,820
Oops.

1644
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:54,900
Oh, geez!

1645
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,700
Where did you go from?

1646
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:57,300
Ah!

1647
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,000
Please!

1648
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,380
Oh, my God.

1649
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:02,900
Oh, my God.

1650
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:05,320
Oh,

1651
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:09,010
my God, oh, my God.

1652
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,520
Please shoot that thing.

1653
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,120
Shoot that thing.

1654
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,600
Oh my

1655
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:27,160
god.

1656
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:27,840
Oh my god.

1657
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,180
Oh my god.

1658
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,780
Oh my god.

1659
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,800
This one's so tough.

1660
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:41,330
It's like all big guys too.

1661
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:42,090
Yeah, exactly.

1662
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,690
Okay, hold on.

1663
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:48,330
The coffee makes me shaky.

1664
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,690
I wonder, okay, what if?

1665
01:47:52,070 --> 01:48:03,750
Because one thing that it does, is when I try to I like to
aim with it but I guess I don't need to okay what if I go

1666
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:13,590
down here and before he smashes it right before I shoot it
and then he smashes it and then maybe it will explode on him

1667
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:22,570
kid me raged hard at this game

1668
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:28,390
Okay, let's try it.

1669
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:30,870
Alright.

1670
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:35,410
Alright, run, run, run.

1671
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,910
Oh, that worked!

1672
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,450
Oh my god, I got him!

1673
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:42,070
Oh, yes, I got him!

1674
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:48,800
Yes!

1675
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:51,240
My big brain!

1676
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,000
AAAAAAAA!

1677
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,060
Where did you come from?

1678
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,100
You asshole?

1679
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,560
Oh, shoot.

1680
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,120
These guys are so fast and scary.

1681
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:20,650
Holy shit.

1682
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:21,170
Holy shit.

1683
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:21,870
Ouch.

1684
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:28,390
Shrunk the ammo.

1685
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:29,790
Just pick it up.

1686
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,970
Any flares?

1687
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:31,930
Oh, I have one left.

1688
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:35,670
That's right.

1689
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,840
Holy shit.

1690
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,220
Yes.

1691
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,480
Yes, sir.

1692
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,520
Yes.

1693
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,840
Oh my god, more!

1694
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,610
No, I won't let you charge.

1695
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:09,010
I won't let you charge.

1696
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:15,280
Don't hold me to?

1697
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,140
Please let me pick up...

1698
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,500
Oh, it's revolver ammo, that's why.

1699
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,540
Oh my god, we did...

1700
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,280
That was...

1701
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,600
That was the stride.

1702
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,000
That was the stride, for real.

1703
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:37,860
Oh, yeah.

1704
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,320
Oh my gosh.

1705
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,040
Well, not really.

1706
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,840
I could have exploded more barrels, maybe.

1707
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:42,520
But I did explode.

1708
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:49,440
some and I did get some guys I'm trying to get the I thought
I saw a thermos where are you there you are on the other

1710
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:13,780

1711
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,620
I have one bolt.

1712
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,040
You know what?

1713
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,020
Time to revolver time, I suppose.

1714
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:20,980
Okay.

1715
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,100
I timed it absolutely perfectly.

1716
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,840
That first one.

1717
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:28,100
Yeah.

1718
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,780
Cross the transformer yard.

1719
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:31,420
What is this?

1720
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:32,240
Metal gear?

1721
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,560
Powerplant glowed in the night.

1722
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:34,720
It was close.

1723
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,740
But I had to find a way across.

1724
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,880
Just swim, Bozo.

1725
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:39,820
Like, what are we talking about?

1726
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,520
I had to find a way across.

1727
01:51:43,480 --> 01:52:02,020
the water I don't know I think I'm done with Alan wait I
think I'm mad at him I think I'm like shut up Alan yeah all

darkest in the water maybe that is the case huh Maybe.

1729
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:20,080
Oh.

1730
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:27,820
I was expecting like a super, like a, like, you know, like a
big heavy door that's opening.

1731
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:37,910
Oh.

1732
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,240
Oh.

1733
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:59,970
Alan Dodge.

1734
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,890
Wait, if I run through...

1735
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:05,390
No.

1736
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:07,330
I don't even think then.

1737
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:09,390
How do I get through?

1738
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:13,210
Alan climb.

1739
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:15,570
Alan climb only once.

1740
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:18,250
It'll get hurt.

1741
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:18,610
Yeah.

1742
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:19,670
I don't want to get zapped.

1743
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:22,530
Obviously.

1744
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:25,810
Alan swim!

1745
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:34,590
I am curious how they are expecting me to get to the other
side.

1746
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:36,450
Oh, there's a bridge over there.

1747
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:37,050
Maybe that.

1748
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,270
Oh.

1749
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:45,310
Oh my gosh!

1750
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,890
Hi!

1751
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:47,830
Tippy!

1752
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:49,310
Okay.

1753
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,890
Oh.

1754
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:52,490
Temporary.

1755
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:54,810
That's fine.

1756
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:58,570
That's fine.

1757
01:53:58,750 --> 01:53:59,770
Does it work again?

1758
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:01,910
Oh.

1759
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:03,570
Oh wow!

1760
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:04,990
I can checkpoint anytime I want!

1761
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:09,130
Huh.

1762
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:15,290
I'm looking around.

1763
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:25,930
La la la la!

1764
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:37,870
That did checkpoint me, right?

1765
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:43,030
Yeah, why did Alan write so many ambushes?

1766
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,290
Great question.

1767
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:45,550
Okay, there, we got a checkpoint.

1768
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,010
Alan Big Brian?

1769
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:50,390
You could call me a writer.

1770
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:52,070
They're

1771
01:54:59,680 --> 01:54:59,960
back.

1772
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:00,920
Oh, they're back.

1773
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:07,310
Um, excuse you.

1774
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:13,630
I thought I heard a third guy.

1775
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,930
Or saw a third guy, rather.

1776
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,050
Kaboom.

1777
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:25,030
Oh, I did- I did.

1778
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:26,070
I 100% did.

1779
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:29,070
I don't care.

1780
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:30,410
They're so big.

1781
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:32,130
They take forever.

1782
01:55:36,890 --> 01:55:38,030
They take forever!

1783
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:47,470
especially with this with this um what's the word?

1784
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:53,850
Flashlight I'm gonna wait for it to recharge they're so
tanky

1785
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:11,780
I hear it whispering something's whispering but whatever oh
checkpoint

1786
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:27,680
la la la la la la la la la three flares whoops whoops Can I
go through here?

1787
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:29,000
No.

1788
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,920
Alright, who's gonna be over there?

1789
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:35,140
I wonder.

1790
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:40,430
Huh?

1791
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:42,170
Eh?

1792
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:43,710
Well.

1793
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:48,230
I thought I heard...

1794
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:48,630
Yellen.

1795
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:51,730
Oh, thermos!

1796
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:54,910
Thermos, my beloved!

1797
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:57,190
Yeah, I'll come for you!

1798
01:56:58,430 --> 01:56:58,950
Come on, Alan.

1799
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,130
Just shimmy on through, buddy.

1800
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:02,400
You can do this.

1801
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,010
Skinny legend.

1802
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:09,690
It's just teasing you, I know.

1803
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,020
Whoa!

1804
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,300
Danger zone!

1805
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,220
Don't touch anything, okay.

1806
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:24,060
Oh.

1807
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:27,620
Shut the hell up.

1808
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:28,500
This is...

1809
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,360
So mean.

1810
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:30,480
Yeah, back up.

1811
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:33,540
Not that way.

1812
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,470
I was hoping that would happen.

1813
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:57,150
Stupid.

1814
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,400
That was Beast Mode Minto Gaming.

1815
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:10,320
Whoa, I wonder why it's all sealed up.

1816
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,140
Why does that look like a trap?

1817
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,780
Like, you know, like a...

1818
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,760
Oh, look, there's an item in the middle.

1819
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:18,960
Don't you want it?

1820
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,460
Don't you want it?

1821
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:23,200
Page on top of this building?

1822
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:30,880
Oh, I got a checkpoint.

1823
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:31,480
Okay, perfect.

1824
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,260
Alan does not know how to jump very well.

1825
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,460
Or use his arms.

1826
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:44,060
Oh!

1827
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,880
What an interesting setup we have here.

1828
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:55,370
What an interesting setup we got going on.

1829
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,810
Oh, she really couldn't have put us, like, further from...

1830
01:59:00,350 --> 01:59:02,510
Wait, there was nothing else over there that I needed,
right?

1831
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:04,350
Looks like we dropped down now.

1832
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:06,830
Yeah, because I just see electricity.

1833
01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:07,570
Okay, cool.

1834
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:12,550
Um...

1835
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:14,130
Did we miss one?

1836
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:14,570
Oh, no!

1837
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:15,110
I hope not.

1838
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:17,170
The story I had written in the cabin had come true.

1839
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:20,730
Touched by the dark presence, I had written a horror story.

1840
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:22,390
But the end was still missing.

1841
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:28,310
The story was incomplete, and the last unfinished page of
the map manuscripts still sat in the typewriter in the cabin

1842
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,850
study.

1843
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:29,210
Oh.

1844
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:35,470
If I could get back there, if I could read the page, then I
could write my own ending to this story and save Alice.

1845
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:37,430
Deus Ex Machina, the whole thing.

1846
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:41,070
It's back towards the entrance of this place.

1847
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:42,870
No kidding, really?

1848
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:44,890
Wait, seriously?

1849
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:50,660
Will the bad...

1850
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:54,100
Will the guys respawn or can we just like run through it
real fast?

1851
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:56,500
I can't believe I missed it.

1852
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,260
you saw lying on the ground.

1853
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,900
I don't think I saw it.

1854
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,040
They shouldn't.

1855
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:07,640
Wait.

1856
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:15,140
Let's, we'll try real quick, because I do obviously want to
collect as many pages as possible.

1857
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:25,570
So back close to where I started.

1858
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,500
Wait, oh, yes!

1859
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,440
I forgot to turn around!

1860
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,580
Oh, okay, okay.

1861
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:45,020
I thought we were having to go, like, you know, actually
back to the beginning.

1862
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:47,320
Oh, good.

1863
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,420
Oh, good, good, good.

1864
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:55,380
Making her way through the water pipe alone, Cynthia was
angry at the writer.

1865
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:58,540
Foolish young man, taking unnecessary risks.

1866
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:02,580
And the way he broke the rules, didn't he understand what
was at stake?

1867
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:02,960
Rules?

1868
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:06,160
Since the terrible days in the 70s, she hadn't wavered once.

1869
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,600
hard as it had been.

1870
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:12,780
She was tired of protecting the town all these long years
and now only wanted to rest.

1871
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:13,900
It's so funny.

1872
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:18,680
The terrible days in the 70s is such a way to describe that.

1873
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:21,720
That's so funny that it wasn't even this page.

1874
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,260
It's this one.

1875
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,560
That's funny though.

1876
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:27,620
Well, yeah, what rules?

1877
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:31,260
Fushi gear.

1878
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:39,390
This part was so evil.

1879
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:51,390
thread the needle they're like don't trip what where is OSHA
hello this doesn't seem safe

1880
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:08,040
the terrible days in the 70s can't wait to tell the young
generation I used to watch mint in the 20s the terrible days

1881
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:28,140
in the 20s oh it's like I was surfing checkpoint love to see
it love to see it making sure there's nothing over here okay

1882
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:42,360
I'm gonna try and swim okay actually that was a speedrun
strat so I don't have to walk all the way back okay just

1883
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:48,780
seeing what all I've got Seeing what all I've got.

1884
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:53,070
Okay.

1885
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:58,890
Wait, the bridge doesn't even connect to it either.

1886
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:01,570
How the hell?

1887
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:03,250
How am I supposed to get over there?

1888
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:05,610
Why did they leave me?

1889
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:12,770
Why did Barry, why did they leave me?

1890
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:15,600
Whoa.

1891
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,540
Crazy bridge.

1892
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:20,160
It's one of those that like turns.

1893
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:22,340
Oh.

1894
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:23,900
Oh.

1895
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:26,000
Visual glitch?

1896
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,680
Oh my gosh, thermos.

1897
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:36,240
I'm getting a lot of funky glitches today!

1898
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:38,140
Where'd he go?

1899
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,920
Alan bugged.

1900
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,680
Yeah, I'm getting a lot of funny bugs and glitches today.

1901
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:54,210
Hello.

1902
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:58,510
I'll take that.

1903
02:03:59,350 --> 02:04:00,010
I'll take that.

1904
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:01,630
Um.

1905
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:04,310
Those guys look like salary men.

1906
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:05,270
They make me laugh.

1907
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:06,890
I'll take that.

1908
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:09,250
Take that and that.

1909
02:04:09,370 --> 02:04:09,810
Oh, checkpoint.

1910
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:12,050
Wait, before so.

1911
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:16,590
Before, though.

1912
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:18,050
What's over here?

1913
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:20,030
I got the checkpoint.

1914
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:22,510
Is there anything?

1915
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:23,450
No manuscript?

1916
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:25,590
No ammo?

1917
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:27,990
Just the worst car pile up ever.

1918
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:30,910
The most inconvenient pile up.

1919
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:32,350
in episode one.

1920
02:04:32,730 --> 02:04:34,310
Survive jumping into a lake from a cliff.

1921
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:37,330
Alan episode five just dies from falling into the water.

1922
02:04:39,230 --> 02:04:42,230
That dude entered like Kramer enters Jerry's apartment.

1923
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:47,510
I also have to wonder why did this happen?

1924
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:51,570
Are we actually murdering people like in the town?

1925
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:53,170
Like is that actually how that works?

1926
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:55,430
Or is it just like a...

1927
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,590
Oh my god, I'm probably gonna have to do that.

1928
02:04:57,890 --> 02:04:59,670
Survive until...

1929
02:05:02,890 --> 02:05:15,470
until the bridge moves kind of situation here huh they're
already dead yesent before I do this though real quick guys

1930
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:23,610
I'm gonna be right back I'm going to the little ghosties
room one second one second one second I will be right back

1931
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:33,290
I'm going fishing wait I'm going fishing I wish wishing I
was fishing okay BRB.

1932
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:15,580
I'm back.

1933
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:18,280
I'm back.

1934
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:20,780
I'm back.

1935
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:26,140
Alrighty, let's fight some zombies.

1936
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,460
Let's do this thing.

1937
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:34,260
Use...

1938
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,560
Cross the bridge.

1939
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,900
So much easier said than done, huh?

1940
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,880
What if I just chill in here for now?

1941
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:46,680
What if I chill in here and wait for it to...

1942
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:47,080
finish?

1943
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:53,400
Did you catch any fish?

1944
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:58,820
Actually, I left the idle fishing game go...

1945
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:00,760
Wait, what's happening?

1946
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:04,520
Hello?

1947
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:05,920
Oh.

1948
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:07,960
Oh, okay.

1949
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:08,660
We're good?

1950
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:13,580
Was that supposed to happen?

1951
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:18,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1952
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:19,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1953
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:21,460
Oh my god, we made it.

1954
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:22,300
Wait, but...

1955
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:23,900
More birds!

1956
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,400
More birds!

1957
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:29,560
Oh shoot!

1958
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:32,520
I just have to stay on this side.

1959
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:34,220
And we'll reach it.

1960
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:43,980
More birds.

1961
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,100
More birds.

1962
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,240
Okay.

1963
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,080
Okay.

1964
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:09,920
I don't know if there was anything else on there, but I
don't really care.

1965
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:11,080
Night Springs!

1966
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:17,560
Are we men dreaming of being butterflies or butterflies that
dream of being men?

1967
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:18,960
Who's dreaming of being a butterfly?

1968
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,220
Wait, what?

1969
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:28,400
And yet, some of us can find concrete proof of the nature of
our existence.

1970
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:33,760
The whole building is shaking while the bridge is like...

1971
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:37,100
Wait, is it not gonna stop?

1972
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:44,030
Am I supposed to be the one to stop it?

1973
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:49,610
Just does that.

1974
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:57,710
It's in the basement.

1975
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:03,410
Oh, Martha.

1976
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:08,380
Whoa.

1977
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,400
I

1978
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:15,510
can't look straight at it.

1979
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:17,930
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

1980
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:19,530
What the heck?

1981
02:11:20,110 --> 02:11:21,930
How did you get here?

1982
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:24,590
Well, I'm trying to work.

1983
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:27,610
Did you put this thing here?

1984
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:31,770
In a way, to be more precise, I put everything here but
that.

1985
02:11:32,370 --> 02:11:32,830
Really?

1986
02:11:33,330 --> 02:11:34,530
But what is it?

1987
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:38,050
Oh, I guess the temptation is to call it a hole.

1988
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:38,870
Yeah, it's a hole.

1989
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:42,150
It's really an absence of a profound lack of reality.

1990
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:43,090
So it's like a black hole?

1991
02:11:43,330 --> 02:11:44,450
In Martha's basement?

1992
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:47,230
In Martha's basement?

1993
02:11:47,310 --> 02:11:48,550
Who voiced these slaves?

1994
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:56,150
two old ladies and put something really weird in the
basement it was a great start but i'm completely blocked now

1995
02:11:56,150 --> 02:12:04,490
i can't imagine what i was up to what what well surely it's
just an ordinary basement is it he wrote them why did you

1996
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:15,290
call your friend here then well i i don't know oh well can
you just ignore it no no i couldn't do that it would

1997
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:23,150
probably turn into a plot hole a plot whole enterprise oh my
god the building is shaking again

1998
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:33,370
i can't hear over the noise of the you should just go back
upstairs for a cup of coffee while i try to figure out what

1999
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:46,270
i'm up to well if you think that's best maybe i should just
stop here or is that too moronic he's stuck in the plot hole

2000
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:49,630
is that too moronic Beat.

2001
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:50,330
You can tell.

2002
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:54,570
It's a fine line between the stupid and the sublime.

2003
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:57,290
Night Springs.

2004
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:00,030
Woo!

2005
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:03,270
Night Springs.

2006
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:04,190
Nice.

2007
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:06,310
All right.

2008
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:09,210
Are they still after me or...

2009
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:12,010
Can't tell.

2010
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:14,250
Checkpoint, please.

2011
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:14,470
Oh.

2012
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:15,250
Oh!

2013
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:18,210
Coast Guard.

2014
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:18,670
Coast Guard.

2015
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:19,830
Oh, nice.

2016
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,690
You're almost at the power plant.

2017
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:22,550
Keep going.

2018
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:23,390
I'll give you support.

2019
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:26,230
Holy cow, they're gonna give me support.

2020
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:27,750
Wait, this is awesome.

2021
02:13:28,650 --> 02:13:29,550
Wait, is there anything over here?

2022
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:29,990
One second.

2023
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,690
So meta, I know, right?

2024
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:37,450
One second, one second.

2025
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:39,690
There's so many cars here.

2026
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:42,050
Like, why are there actually so...

2027
02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:46,150
I guess all these people that were leaving work from the
power plant, I have to imagine.

2028
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:48,750
Pequod!

2029
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,500
Whoa, you're fast.

2030
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,780
Support, support, support.

2031
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:05,820
Oh my god.

2032
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:07,860
Wait.

2033
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:09,140
Oh!

2034
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,840
Wait, you're in the light!

2035
02:14:37,030 --> 02:14:38,130
Excuse me!

2036
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:41,010
Oh my gosh.

2037
02:14:43,290 --> 02:14:43,990
Are we moving again?

2038
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:46,230
Come on.

2039
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:47,330
Wait, where are we going?

2040
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:48,830
Which way is this?

2041
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:50,250
Hello?

2042
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:52,490
Is it?

2043
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:55,390
Okay.

2044
02:14:55,690 --> 02:14:57,110
I'll just keep going then.

2045
02:14:57,670 --> 02:14:57,950
Oh, okay.

2046
02:14:58,510 --> 02:14:58,810
Why?

2047
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:00,470
Why are you going so fast?

2048
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:04,270
Oh my gosh.

2049
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:10,270
My dodge skills are unmatched.

2050
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:13,890
Whoa!

2051
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:14,450
Jeez!

2052
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:20,520
Oh my god!

2053
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:21,140
Oh my god!

2054
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:21,380
Sorry.

2055
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:23,760
The bug, the bug, the bug, the bug.

2056
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:25,280
Oh shit, oh shit!

2057
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:28,220
They all three came at me at once!

2058
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:30,320
The bug, the bug?

2059
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:30,660
Okay.

2060
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:35,380
Oh my gosh, it takes me out every time.

2061
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:39,100
I think I need to, like, use this bad boy.

2062
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:41,080
Oh my god.

2063
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:46,820
Oh my god.

2064
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:47,500
Oh my god.

2065
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:56,020
Oh, they're so strong.

2066
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:57,660
They're so stinking strong.

2067
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:09,840
um okay hold on let's uh i'm i'm preparing myself real quick
i got clogged hard it's so funny that they can go into this

2068
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,900
light right why is that allowed

2069
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:23,540
flashbang that's right that's right

2070
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:32,020

2071
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:39,940
on you

2072
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:50,300
I'm not wasting my shotgun ammo on you.

2073
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:54,240
Okay.

2074
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,140
Helly light hits different, I guess.

2075
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,520
Yeah, what the heck is this?

2076
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:01,660
Hold on, I'm letting my...

2077
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:06,950
I just have the flare gun ready.

2078
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,420
The flashbang really did help, though.

2079
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:21,200
Alright.

2080
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:22,720
I find...

2081
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,380
Okay, let's go.

2082
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:28,780
This helicopter support sucks.

2083
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:31,400
What is this?

2084
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:32,340
What kind of support?

2085
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:40,350
Get inside!

2086
02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:40,670
Okay!

2087
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:41,870
Where's inside?

2088
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,260
Hold on.

2089
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:48,840
Oh my god!

2090
02:17:48,980 --> 02:17:49,580
Oh my god!

2091
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:51,820
Holy cow!

2092
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:52,920
That was so close.

2093
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,520
Oops, birds, yeah.

2094
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:58,120
Wait, what's over here?

2095
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:01,640
Secret?

2096
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:06,100
The support lasted two seconds.

2097
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:08,520
Oh, nice.

2098
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:14,410
Take everything.

2099
02:18:14,890 --> 02:18:16,010
Yes, very good.

2100
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:21,270
Awesome.

2101
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:23,770
Yeah, the music stopped.

2102
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:30,570
Is that just a flare on the ground?

2103
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,750
Wait, no checkpoint?

2104
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:32,490
Oh, so I mean.

2105
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:35,230

Safe haven, she says.

Generator hall.

you nice oh my gosh i hope her power doesn't fail because of

2127
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:51,880

wherever i go you know like i kind of bring misfortune to

2128
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:58,700
everybody who uh excuse me what do you say you need to drive
the darkness back The well-lit room is at the dam.

2129
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:00,880
I built the room to keep it safe.

2130
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:02,600
Will it help me find Alice?

2131
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:03,940
Will it get me back to the cabin?

2132
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:04,840
Fine, let's go.

2133
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:07,380
I can get my friends to come back with the helicopter.

2134
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,000
Oh, we won't go outside.

2135
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:12,340
Never at night.

2136
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,840
That's rule number one.

2137
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:14,240
Yeah.

2138
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:17,080
You've been breaking the rules, young man, and where has
that gotten us?

2139
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:17,940
Hmm?

2140
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:20,740
No, I have a secret route, a lit route.

2141
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:21,640
Oh.

2142
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:24,420
Oh.

2143
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:34,580
at the transformer yard it's the rain all the reserve power
without it the pipe will go dark the power to the yard must

2144
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:42,880

the one who likes to break the rules i can't be outside in

2147
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:58,180
Oh, never mind.

2148
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,600
You got lucky.

2149
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:04,880
Cut the power to the transformer yard.

2150
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,300
I'm taking her thermos even.

2151
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:12,540
I have been preparing for these times, the dark tides.

2152
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,700
You have found my caches.

2153
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:16,200
Yeah, I've been taking everything.

2154
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:16,720
See the signs.

2155
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,000
Very few people can.

2156
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,300
Yes, please.

2157
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:20,800
Take what you need.

2158
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:21,420
Oh, see, I'm not stealing.

2159
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:23,540
This is all for you, for the likes of us.

2160
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,340
We do Tom's work, don't we?

2161
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,120
Hurry!

2162
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:29,660
The switch is on the wall facing the shore.

2163
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:31,580
Okay, hold on.

2164
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:33,360
Oh, that's my old flashlight.

2165
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:35,660
Oh, my goodness.

2166
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:38,080
Why is it so bright?

2167
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,380
Oh, it's batteries.

2168
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,160
I don't need anymore.

2169
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:41,440
I think those are batteries, too, yeah.

2170
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,500
So I gotta go cut the power to...

2171
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:48,480
I cannot take you to the well-lit room if the lights and the
pipe go out.

2172
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:52,380
You must go outside to use the emergency switch.

2173
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:53,620
Okay, okay!

2174
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:55,980
One second, you said take all I need.

2175
02:22:56,120 --> 02:22:56,640
I am!

2176
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:58,380
That's what I'm doing right now, lady.

2177
02:22:59,140 --> 02:22:59,800
Oh, man.

2178
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:08,130
I do have four of these bad boys.

2179
02:23:10,130 --> 02:23:10,890
No, it's not dark.

2180
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:12,010
Light.

2181
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:14,850
Alright, so it's where?

2182
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:15,590
Where is this?

2183
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:16,390
The transform?

2184
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:25,860
Okay.

2185
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,980
Is that- Oh, it's here.

2186
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:29,260
Okay.

2187
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:31,380
Thanks, I guess.

2188
02:23:36,370 --> 02:23:37,350
What does this do?

2189
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:40,110
If only this were it, right?

2190
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:41,370
If only if it were so easy.

2191
02:23:44,710 --> 02:23:45,850
Can't go in there.

2192
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,350
All right.

2193
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,450
Very cool.

2194
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:51,110
Cut the...

2195
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:57,070
Back up, buddy!

2196
02:23:57,570 --> 02:23:58,230
Back up!

2197
02:23:58,610 --> 02:23:58,830
Back up!

2198
02:23:58,930 --> 02:23:59,530
Back up!

2199
02:24:00,010 --> 02:24:00,970
You both of you!

2200
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:01,610
Back up!

2201
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:03,190
Oh, shoot.

2202
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:04,750
That didn't get you at all.

2203
02:24:05,890 --> 02:24:06,030
Oh!

2204
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:08,110
Oh, I forgot that I was holding this way.

2205
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:08,870
Oops.

2206
02:24:09,310 --> 02:24:09,870
Well, that worked.

2207
02:24:10,970 --> 02:24:12,030
The other guy was on me anyway.

2208
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,530
I just wasted so many things.

2209
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:14,470
Oh, okay.

2210
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:16,270
Where the hell did you come from?

2211
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:24,620
Overkill.

2212
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:27,120
The druid sent me to cut the power to the transformer yard.

2213
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,180
I was willing to do grunt work for her to get her to help
me.

2214
02:24:30,280 --> 02:24:30,740
Yeah, exactly.

2215
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,160
I hoped Weaver was dependable.

2216
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:35,480
I'd stumbled into this crazy world a little over a week ago.

2217
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,100
She had been living this insanity for decades.

2218
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:41,220
Darkness waits.

2219
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:43,460
Why did you write that there?

2220
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:46,820
The game gives you tons of resources.

2221
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:47,940
It does until it doesn't.

2222
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:48,840
But yeah, you're right.

2223
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:49,440
It does.

2224
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:50,340
For the most part.

2225
02:24:59,340 --> 02:24:59,580
Never go.

2226
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:00,160
Rule one.

2227
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:00,980
Never go out.

2228
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:02,720
Someone's going to bust out of there.

2229
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:07,220
When we're like coming back, someone's definitely...

2230
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:08,200
Oh.

2231
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,620
No, wait.

2232
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:12,060
This is her place.

2233
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:13,360
Never mind.

2234
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:14,100
We might be okay.

2235
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,820
You're so cute in your black outfit.

2236
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:17,560
Thank you.

2237
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:20,040
I feel like it fits the tone of the game, right?

2238
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:21,240
Why is that thing shaking?

2239
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:22,620
Is he cold?

2240
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,720
If you're cold, he's cold.

2241
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:30,500
I'm working on a coding assignment for my college class and
just realized the project file is called lights off.

2242
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,140
No!

2243
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:36,270
He's shivering.

2244
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:40,070
Oh.

2245
02:25:40,890 --> 02:25:41,210
Oh.

2246
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:46,270
We're moving.

2247
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:49,970
Slightly.

2248
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:51,990
What's happening?

2249
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,190
Oh.

2250
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:54,770
Interesting.

2251
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:55,650
Okay, anyway, sorry.

2252
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:56,340
I'm so easily...

2253
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:07,250
that would cut the power that went all the way over there
now i had to find a way to reach it okay alan think

2254
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:15,510
floodgate controls all right interesting okay what we got
going on over here oh my gosh alan puzzle time let's go

2255
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:25,330
let's go figure out the gates yeah yeah yeah what's that
kill switch rule three always remember the lantern what's

2256
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:26,210
rule number two

2257
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:32,640
did it.

2258
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:34,600
I think.

2259
02:26:38,570 --> 02:26:38,930
Okay.

2260
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:42,610
Cool.

2261
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,040
Oh no!

2262
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:49,540
Never mind.

2263
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,860
I didn't realize this one was blocked.

2264
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:51,640
Okay, wait.

2265
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:56,960
So I think we have to get this unblocked first.

2266
02:26:57,060 --> 02:26:57,640
Okay, just kidding.

2267
02:26:57,800 --> 02:26:57,980
Alright.

2268
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:03,520
Here I was thinking I had the biggest brain in the whole
universe.

2269
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:06,980
What's this one do?

2270
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:11,320
And what's this one do?

2271
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:18,900
So if I press this one, is it go back to the first thing?

2272
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,820
It's been a beautiful 21 months in the meantime.

2273
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:27,440
Thank you.

2274
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:28,400
Thank you.

2275
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:33,690
Thank you.

2276
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:39,810
Alan Kick.

2277
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:53,690
rule number two keep the lights on oh Alan punch

2278
02:27:57,170 --> 02:28:04,530
so now we have to get all three of them nice try I really
thought that was the solution

2279
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:15,380
you thought again I really did floodgate controls to be by
authorized personnel only.

2280
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,360
Oh, man.

2281
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:21,100
Okay, wait.

2282
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:24,340
Maybe it's number two.

2283
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:29,260
Oh, yeah.

2284
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:30,900
Actually, that works.

2285
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:33,420
You know what?

2286
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:34,940
Actually, I was making it more difficult.

2287
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:35,380
Oh, wait.

2288
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:35,940
No, it doesn't.

2289
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:37,040
I'm so stupid.

2290
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:40,860
Okay, hold on.

2291
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:56,200
If I do this, does it do all three?

2292
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:01,660
Ah, ah, ah.

2293
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:02,080
Oh,

2294
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:32,570
yeah, I know, I know.

2295
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:34,330
Oh, more shotgun ammo, actually.

2296
02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:37,730
Nice shot, thank you.

2297
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:42,590
All right, wait, can I...

2298
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:44,710
Is this...

2299
02:29:46,410 --> 02:29:51,470
Okay, no, I have to run how I did before.

2300
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:53,750
Oh my gosh, this is going to be stressful.

2301
02:29:56,850 --> 02:29:58,890
That's what I'm thinking.

2302
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:03,030
Oh!

2303
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:09,330
Oh, but now this is open.

2304
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:10,390
No, it is not.

2305
02:30:10,530 --> 02:30:12,770
The transporter yard would dark and dead.

2306
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:16,030
Weaver's water pipe passage should now be good to go.

2307
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,080
Oh my gosh.

2308
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:25,100
Yeah, technically you did, Alan.

2309
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:25,920
So true.

2310
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:27,140
Oh my gosh, please run.

2311
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:28,060
Please run.

2312
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:31,780
Checkpoint.

2313
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:35,980
Go, go, go.

2314
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:37,860
Wait, I'm going to get my flare out instead.

2315
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,400
Yeah, so I can just run with it.

2316
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:41,720
Oh!

2317
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:53,960
Why can't I go through the door?

2318
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:54,680
That's why.

2319
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,220
Why is this not open?

2320
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:05,500
Why is this not open?

2321
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:07,080
Open the door?

2322
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:09,320
Open your...

2323
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:09,960
Oh god!

2324
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:10,460
Oh god!

2325
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:34,400
We're running?

2326
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:45,820
Wait, what was that?

2327
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,800
Oh, it was the...

2328
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:47,520
Oh my gosh.

2329
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:50,580
I did it!

2330
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:51,600
This way, young man.

2331
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:52,160
Follow me.

2332
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:52,880
Come, come.

2333
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:53,920
The pipe's empty now.

2334
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:54,640
We're ready to go.

2335
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:55,540
Okay, cool.

2336
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,660
I was a little stressful, lady.

2337
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,840
This way, we need to go.

2338
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:00,520
Okay.

2339
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:02,940
I knew them both, Tom, and...

2340
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:06,240
Barbara, I had such a crush on him.

2341
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,240
Such a beautiful man.

2342
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:10,300
I was jealous.

2343
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:15,540
There was a part of me that was maybe a little glad when she
had the accident.

2344
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:21,280
And then Tom started riding and woke the darkness up.

2345
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:24,840
He tried to bring it back, but you can't do that.

2346
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:27,400
There are no free rides like that.

2347
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:28,380
What is...

2348
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:30,680
What is she just...

2349
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:34,700
In that case, young man, perhaps you're a smarter man than
Tom was.

2350
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,400
The witch looked like her.

2351
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:41,140
Barbara was sweet.

2352
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:44,260
He didn't understand until it was too late.

2353
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:49,220
He tried to undo it, wrote himself, everything he'd ever
written out of the world.

2354
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:50,460
Like all of this unprompted.

2355
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:51,560
For real.

2356
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:52,580
He was so famous.

2357
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:55,580
And afterward, no one knew.

2358
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:56,520
No.

2359
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:57,020
Oh.

2360
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:02,160
He left only one thing behind in my game in case it happened
again.

2361
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:03,420
Insurance.

2362
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:05,400
He trusted me.

2363
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,220
Or perhaps mused me a little.

2364
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:08,800
Oh.

2365
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:09,000
Oh.

2366
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:10,800
Tom knew how I felt.

2367
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:12,760
Knew I wouldn't refuse him.

2368
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,320
I built the well-lit room and put it there.

2369
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:18,100
I curse you, Tom Zade.

2370
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:21,560
We are characters trapped in a story you have written.

2371
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:23,840
And none of us will survive to see the end.

2372
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:28,420
But if the darkness isn't stopped, she'll twist the story to
her own dark ends.

2373
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:30,160
How do you know all this?

2374
02:33:30,700 --> 02:33:33,040
Tom, that's the way he wrote it.

2375
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:33,800
Oh.

2376
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:34,920
He still talks to me.

2377
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:37,320
In television, beyond.

2378
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:38,440
In the television?

2379
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:42,220
We have both been touched by the darkness, young man.

2380
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:47,180
He saved us both by the light, but the darkness stays here.

2381
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:48,600
You need help with that?

2382
02:33:53,900 --> 02:33:57,380
This pipe will take us directly to the well-lit room.

2383
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,340
Okay, I need to call my friends.

2384
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:00,980
Tell them where we're going.

2385
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:02,420
Little, little, little.

2386
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:03,280
Hello?

2387
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:04,460
Ow!

2388
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:05,840
Barry, oh my gosh.

2389
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:08,620
That's Alan Wake using AI.

2390
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:12,920

2391

down that's it that's all you got The well-lit room.

2397
02:35:21,810 --> 02:35:23,330
I was calling it the well-lit room.

2398
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:24,150
It's so funny.

2399
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:25,450
I don't know why.

2400
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,110
It's just like...

2401
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:30,130
Oh my god.

2402
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:32,570
It's one thing after another.

2403
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:34,190
Why did you write it like this, Alan?

2404
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:35,950
Why did you write it like this?

2405
02:35:36,230 --> 02:35:37,390
I'll never forgive you.

2406
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,500
Oh, we still have two more missing pages, right?

2407
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:44,860
Yeah.

2408
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,680
Sarah was almost starting to relax.

2409
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:51,000
Maybe they could turn this into a win yet.

2410
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:58,620
Suddenly, there was a piercing sound like a table saw going
wild as a hundred birds made out of shadows swarmed into the

2411
02:35:58,620 --> 02:35:58,920
rotor.

2412
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:03,660
The chopper bucked wildly and the board lit up, telling her
what she already knew.

2413
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:05,100
They were going down.

2414
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,440
Barry Wheeler screamed next to her.

2415
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:15,320
You know, at any point, they could have locked or sorry,
they could have landed the helicopter and joined us in the

2416
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:15,720
pipe.

2417
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:20,840
At any point, they could have landed the helicopter.

2418
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:23,340
And joined us walking to the room.

2419
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:26,300
Why?

2420
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:28,940
Why did they not do that?

2421
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:34,140
I'm going to become the Joker.

2422
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:36,020
I'm just...

2423
02:36:41,690 --> 02:36:42,450
Oh,

2424
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:48,320
I'm just...

2425
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:48,960
I just...

2426
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:58,500
Yeah.

2427
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:00,420
Take him out.

2428
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:00,580
Take him out.

2429
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,300
Yeah!

2430
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:11,780
Oh shit!

2431
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:13,340
I

2432
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:25,370
didn't have enough battery.

2433
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:26,570
Wait, I saw something.

2434
02:37:28,770 --> 02:37:29,390
Yeah!

2435
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:32,270
She's jonkling out.

2436
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:33,290
I am!

2437
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:36,590
Oh my gosh!

2438
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:39,070
They're just so stupid!

2439
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:42,830
Oh, this is a checkpoint I just realized.

2440
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:43,270
Nice.

2441
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:44,650
He's the logger.

2442
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:45,950
The log.

2443
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:48,550
Are they coming after me?

2444
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:49,390
Oh yes.

2445
02:37:53,490 --> 02:37:57,190
Oh, there was a log here we could have gone down.

2446
02:37:57,370 --> 02:37:58,330
That's fine.

2447
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:06,600
Nice.

2448
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,960
Oh, there's a log here we got across.

2449
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:16,050
Oh,

2450
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,040
that was close.

2451
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,360
I didn't even see them.

2452
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:25,620
I was trying to aim for other guys.

2453
02:38:52,770 --> 02:38:55,270
Just reached the crash site!

2454
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:56,170
Barry!

2455
02:38:56,730 --> 02:38:57,450
Sheriff Baker!

2456
02:38:57,930 --> 02:38:58,230
Sarah!

2457
02:38:59,590 --> 02:39:00,830
They already left?

2458
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:01,950
Or they fell.

2459
02:39:02,290 --> 02:39:03,210
No, they're alive.

2460
02:39:04,490 --> 02:39:04,950
I believe.

2461
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:09,310
The crash site looked bad, but as far as I could tell, the
wreck was empty.

2462
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:10,610
Yeah?

2463
02:39:11,090 --> 02:39:12,070
Yeah, that's true.

2464
02:39:13,450 --> 02:39:14,370
Pick up Flare.

2465
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:15,810
Oh.

2466
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:31,530
yeah thanks oh another flare oh my gosh I'm like a kid in
candy any more flares the well lit oh it's such a good thing

2467
02:39:31,530 --> 02:39:36,870

2468
02:39:40,830 --> 02:39:43,930
very very very

2469
02:39:50,710 --> 02:39:51,830
Keep hitting them!

2470
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:52,790
Keep hitting them!

2471
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:53,950
Keep hitting them!

2472
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:54,990
Keep hitting them!

2473
02:39:55,470 --> 02:39:56,250
Keep hitting them!

2474
02:39:56,450 --> 02:39:56,550
Oh,

2475
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:00,620
shoot.

2476
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:06,060
Yeah, baby.

2477
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:07,800
That's the strong stuff.

2478
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,260
Keep hitting them.

2479
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:16,380
Keep hitting them.

2480
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:17,220
You know when to make an entrance wake.

2481
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,360
We were ready to make like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid.

2482
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:22,280
I have a different ending in mind.

2483
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:23,200
Ha ha ha ha.

2484
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,000
I'm fine.

2485
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:25,820
Thanks for asking.

2486
02:40:26,560 --> 02:40:27,280
are back!

2487
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:38,460
I hear whispers.

2488
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:40,180
Are you guys flashing?

2489
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:41,740
Oh, yes, yes.

2490
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:42,680
Wait.

2491
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,120
Oh, here.

2492
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:44,720
Up here, up here.

2493
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:45,700
Okay, okay.

2494
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:50,280
Keep hitting him.

2495
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:51,200
Keep hitting him.

2496
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:52,880
This is kind of far.

2497
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:54,100
Hello?

2498
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:55,580
Oh, okay, we got it.

2499
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:02,500
Yahoo!

2500
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:03,520
Okay.

2501
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:05,440
Oh, thank you, Sheriff.

2502
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,180
And friends.

2503
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:10,160
Is this, this is not where we're supposed to go, right?

2504
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,540
Or maybe it is.

2505
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:17,580
A different way, technically, I suppose.

2506
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,320
We gotta get to the top of the dam.

2507
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:24,160
Oh yeah, we could have, okay, okay.

2508
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:27,780
Nice.

2509
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:29,100
Page!

2510
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:30,160
Where?

2511
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:33,320
There's a page somewhere?

2512
02:41:40,010 --> 02:41:40,730
I don't see.

2513
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,950
Pizza dinner!

2514
02:41:43,310 --> 02:41:44,190
I want some pizza!

2515
02:41:46,310 --> 02:41:47,870
Well, I don't see a page.

2516
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:50,790
They're usually very...

2517
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:51,910
Very bright.

2518
02:41:53,050 --> 02:41:54,230
Oh, my flare gun is equipped.

2519
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:54,630
Thank you.

2520
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:01,760
I want pizza.

2521
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:03,920
Sounds good.

2522
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:12,140
when you spend most of your night running uphill while a
crazy bunch of demon hicks try to take your head off with an

2523
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:26,080
axe you know your helicopter crash landed in night springs
so true he's already said this before I'm never gonna get

2524
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:29,460
used to this he's already said this before I'm never I
should have kept that gym membership are you know what

2525
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:37,740
you'll save your your breath that's the elevator we need to
take okay you'll save your breath if you stop talking so

2526
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:56,340
much Barry it's real you can't believe I saw something oh oh
crap there's more than one of them uh nothing moves like

2527
02:42:56,340 --> 02:43:04,320
that it's impossible are is are we really questioning stuff
I'm working on it.

2528
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:06,300
He's too fast.

2529
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:07,600
I can't get a shot.

2530
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:09,860
I'm working on it.

2531
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:10,660
Where'd he go?

2532
02:43:10,700 --> 02:43:11,360
No, there!

2533
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:13,440
Ow, they're all over the place.

2534
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:14,280
Just keep walking.

2535
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:17,940
How many of them are there?

2536
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:18,640
Where'd that one go?

2537
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:19,400
There's like two, right?

2538
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,120
Oh shoot.

2539
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:23,040
Okay, I got one.

2540
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,820
All me, all me.

2541
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:26,360
How the hell did that freak go?

2542
02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:28,380
Wait, this is bad.

2543
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,800
This is really bad.

2544
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:32,740
All me, all me?

2545
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:37,380
Nice.

2546
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,860
Keep winning them.

2547
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:40,280
Just got a promotion!

2548
02:43:41,360 --> 02:43:43,800
Celebrated by buying a ticket to Ochi Uplink.

2549
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:45,300
I wonder who is going to be there.

2550
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:46,440
Congratulations!

2551
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:50,100
Oh my gosh.

2552
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,140
Hey, how?

2553
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:52,440
I got a bad feeling.

2554
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:54,160
Let's keep our eyes open.

2555
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:56,100
This is a bad idea.

2556
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:57,560
I know we're going to regret this.

2557
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:58,120
Thermus.

2558
02:43:58,580 --> 02:43:59,760
Wait, call the elevator.

2559
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:00,960
I'm keeping watch.

2560
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:02,500
I think I hear something moving around.

2561
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:03,800
Stop saying that.

2562
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:04,720
You're freaking me out.

2563
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:10,420
Yeah, it will be an Oshi Outlink with a dancer too!

2564
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:14,480
Hope to see you guys there.

2565
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:15,920
Oh, we have full everything.

2566
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:21,100
Calling the elevator and now we wait for it to come down
very, very slowly.

2567
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:24,180
And we will be ambushed in the meantime.

2568
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:24,700
Heads up!

2569
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,500
Here they come!

2570
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,720
Right on cue!

2571
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:45,920
Oh no!

2572
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:46,000
Oh no!

2573
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:48,020
Oh no!

2574
02:44:48,140 --> 02:44:48,680
Oh no!

2575
02:44:48,980 --> 02:44:49,380
Oh no!

2576
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:52,320
Why is everything in slow motion?

2577
02:44:56,300 --> 02:45:00,740
Barry, don't get too close, buddy.

2578
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:03,020
Let me handle this.

2579
02:45:03,220 --> 02:45:05,280
I swear this is the slowest elevator, I guess.

2580
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,660
Le epic.

2581
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:13,580
Oh, I just saw them literally spawn in the place.

2582
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:24,100
Barry is recognizing video game logic.

2583
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:31,650
Yeah, buddy.

2584
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:36,570
Oh, shoot.

2585
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:40,790
Oh, why did I click the wrong button instead of running?

2586
02:45:40,990 --> 02:45:41,770
Oh, my gosh.

2587
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:44,050
I am.

2588
02:45:44,850 --> 02:45:46,710
It's extra safety, I guess.

2589
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:51,230
I clicked the other one instead of run.

2590
02:45:52,010 --> 02:45:52,970
We're almost there.

2591
02:45:53,330 --> 02:45:55,190
There's an entrance into the dam at the top.

2592
02:45:55,630 --> 02:45:56,650
What's the plan, Wake?

2593
02:45:57,710 --> 02:46:04,450
crazy but she's got something Zane left behind something to
fix yeah she's also like a fangirl could you be a little

2594
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:15,730
more vague Thomas Zane seriously might as well be Paul
Bunyan or Bigfoot yeah well he was real he was real to me

2595
02:46:15,730 --> 02:46:24,390
I'm surprised the elevator actually worked oh my gosh let's
be careful okay I'm surprised it actually didn't break on us

2596
02:46:24,390 --> 02:46:25,950
or something I hate this

2597
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:32,620
Okay, wake.

2598
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,700
There's a button over there that opens the door.

2599
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:35,580
There is.

2600
02:46:36,340 --> 02:46:37,120
Oh, this one?

2601
02:46:37,640 --> 02:46:38,440
Wait, hold on.

2602
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:41,320
Oh, well-lit room?

2603
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:43,300
Oh my gosh, it's the well-lit room!

2604
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:46,140
Wait, what's...

2605
02:46:48,530 --> 02:46:51,830
I'm looking for any manuscripts, but I don't see any pages.

2606
02:46:53,270 --> 02:46:55,250
Do they need Alan alive?

2607
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:58,410
Great question.

2608
02:47:00,170 --> 02:47:00,930
Oh, I have to hold it?

2609
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:04,430
I think something's broken.

2610
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:06,410
Hold the button down so we can get in.

2611
02:47:08,010 --> 02:47:09,470
Oh, so you guys can get in.

2612
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:11,010
Okay.

2613
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,430
Sure.

2614
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:20,530
What's going on?

2615
02:47:20,530 --> 02:47:22,190
We can get to the dam through here.

2616
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:23,590
What's happening out there?

2617
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:25,770
You guys go ahead and find Weaver.

2618
02:47:26,170 --> 02:47:27,330
She should be in the dam now.

2619
02:47:27,570 --> 02:47:29,270
I'll have to make it alone through the top.

2620
02:47:29,550 --> 02:47:31,050
Okay, good luck.

2621
02:47:31,230 --> 02:47:32,810
Don't get yourself killed.

2622
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:35,230
Now, please be careful.

2623
02:47:35,970 --> 02:47:37,630
I'll take good care of Barry Wade.

2624
02:47:38,050 --> 02:47:39,610
You just look after yourself.

2625
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:44,470
I'm not even amused right now.

2626
02:47:45,130 --> 02:47:45,170
Oh!

2627
02:47:46,850 --> 02:47:48,470
You gotta be kidding me.

2628
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:48,990
That, no.

2629
02:47:49,630 --> 02:47:50,530
You did this.

2630
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:52,170
Oh my gosh.

2631
02:48:01,310 --> 02:48:03,930
There goes my last flare, too.

2632
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:06,330
I don't want to accidentally use that.

2633
02:48:12,830 --> 02:48:14,250
It's because I'm holding.

2634
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:26,330
Holding down, I often accidentally hit RB because I'm
holding down LT to focus and so I don't think to like dodge

2635
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:29,350
or like, you know, because I'm my index finger.

2636
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:30,630
Whatever, it's fine.

2637
02:48:31,310 --> 02:48:32,150
Oh, there's a page.

2638
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:38,640
It is what it is.

2639
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:39,700
Small fingers.

2640
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:44,920
Yeah, I think I actually mixed, actually, actually missed
one.

2641
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:45,580
That's so upsetting.

2642
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:52,460
Thomas Zane knew he had to remove all that had made this
horror possible including himself that was the only way to

2643
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:59,180
banish the dark presence he had unleashed and now looked at
him through the eyes of his dead love dead love despite his

2644
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:05,680
best efforts his dead love someday return so even as he
wrote himself and his work out of existence he added a

2645
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:14,500
loophole as insurance an exception to the rule anything of
his stored in a shoebox would remain interested hot dog hot

2646
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:20,580
dog just finished work Don't know if this has been brought
up yet, but how many times did you get pinged about the

2647
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:21,880
Koharu Nendo news?

2648
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:29,320
Only a couple times, but it showed up naturally in my
Twitter page, like in my Twitter for you, so.

2649
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:31,620
Drew, welcome to membership.

2650
02:49:31,880 --> 02:49:32,900
Thank you.

2651
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:33,320
Thank you.

2652
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:37,500
My dead love.

2653
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:55,520
Oh, this game pisses me off.

2654
02:49:57,280 --> 02:49:58,000
Am I supposed to?

2655
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:58,600
Oh, this way.

2656
02:49:58,920 --> 02:49:59,460
My bad.

2657
02:50:02,660 --> 02:50:04,380
See, it's so bright here, right?

2658
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:10,460
Like, I'm like, there's no way anything could be around, but
that's not the case, apparently.

2659
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:13,160
Reach the top of the dam.

2660
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:17,280
So much easier said than...

2661
02:50:21,940 --> 02:50:24,140
So much easier said than done.

2662
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:26,260
Oh, gosh.

2663
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,260
Oh, gosh.

2664
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:28,000
Turn around!

2665
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:32,240
Oh!

2666
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:33,380
They're from all over!

2667
02:50:49,860 --> 02:50:50,460
Yeah!

2668
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:52,780
That's right.

2669
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:55,800
The well-lit...

2670
02:50:55,800 --> 02:50:58,440
Wait, the one that was at the bottom wasn't the well-it
room?

2671
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:01,340
God damn it.

2672
02:51:04,460 --> 02:51:08,120
Oh, I should reload my gun.

2673
02:51:13,690 --> 02:51:15,570
There we go.

2674
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:17,570
Oh, flare?

2675
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:19,870
Ah!

2676
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:25,510
I was ridiculously outnumbered.

2677
02:51:25,810 --> 02:51:27,330
The searchlight could even the odds.

2678
02:51:27,850 --> 02:51:27,850
Oh.

2679
02:51:28,990 --> 02:51:29,550
You're right.

2680
02:51:31,270 --> 02:51:31,930
Uh, use?

2681
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:34,410
Patrol.

2682
02:51:34,650 --> 02:51:35,290
Oh, boost.

2683
02:51:50,110 --> 02:51:52,710
I hope nobody's coming up from behind me.

2684
02:51:53,790 --> 02:51:56,590
That'd be pretty bad if anybody came up from behind me.

2685
02:51:57,150 --> 02:51:58,030
Just saying.

2686
02:51:58,450 --> 02:51:59,670
Oh my god, there's so many guys.

2687
02:52:00,150 --> 02:52:01,110
Wait, what the heck is this?

2688
02:52:03,070 --> 02:52:03,830
Oh god!

2689
02:52:04,490 --> 02:52:05,230
Like I said!

2690
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:11,350
Stop throwing things at me.

2691
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:21,160
Turrets, actually.

2692
02:52:22,940 --> 02:52:23,860
Defeat the taker.

2693
02:52:24,140 --> 02:52:24,460
No, okay.

2694
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:26,020
You will go no further.

2695
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:27,640
Oh, the trees!

2696
02:52:29,540 --> 02:52:31,060
Oh shoot, wait, that's actually kind of bad.

2697
02:52:31,780 --> 02:52:31,960
Wait.

2698
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:32,760
Ooh.

2699
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:39,460
Escape the dark presence!

2700
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,060
Oh, okay.

2701
02:52:45,190 --> 02:52:46,530
Running, running, running, running.

2702
02:52:47,910 --> 02:52:49,010
Is it this guy?

2703
02:52:56,710 --> 02:52:59,090
Could really use a well-lit room right now.

2704
02:53:00,350 --> 02:53:00,470
Oh.

2705
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:02,250
I think I went the wrong way.

2706
02:53:08,670 --> 02:53:09,630
This way.

2707
02:53:09,850 --> 02:53:10,290
Oh!

2708
02:53:11,690 --> 02:53:12,250
Woo!

2709
02:53:13,310 --> 02:53:13,730
Woo!

2710
02:53:15,090 --> 02:53:15,650
Woo!

2711
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:29,850
Reach the top of the dam, they said.

2712
02:53:29,970 --> 02:53:32,210
It will be easier after you get to the top, they said.

2713
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:37,530
Here's a well-lit room, they said!

2714
02:53:38,070 --> 02:53:38,610
Oh my goodness.

2715
02:53:39,930 --> 02:53:41,130
Thermus, they said!

2716
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:47,510
Holy cow!

2717
02:53:48,870 --> 02:53:49,690
Oh shoot.

2718
02:53:50,310 --> 02:53:50,490
Oops.

2719
02:53:51,070 --> 02:53:51,330
Sorry.

2720
02:53:51,350 --> 02:53:53,350
Sorry, I didn't realize that it was...

2721
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:57,270
Where am I?

2722
02:53:57,690 --> 02:53:58,170
Oh, up here.

2723
02:54:00,410 --> 02:54:01,430
Alan leap!

2724
02:54:04,450 --> 02:54:05,910
That's what he... Alan do!

2725
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:17,170
Alan escape.

2726
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:23,050
Ah, yep!

2727
02:54:23,830 --> 02:54:24,310
Oh shoot!

2728
02:54:24,670 --> 02:54:25,690
Oh my god, that was close.

2729
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:30,090
Well lit, Rube!

2730
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:39,560
Oh shoot.

2731
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2732
02:54:46,460 --> 02:54:48,480
It's the well-lit room!

2733
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:50,640
Baby?

2734
02:54:51,700 --> 02:54:51,840
Woo!

2735
02:54:53,720 --> 02:54:55,060
Poorly lit damn.

2736
02:54:56,580 --> 02:54:57,100
Golly!

2737
02:54:57,440 --> 02:55:01,140
I'm glad I was wrong.

2738
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:03,380
But it was a foolish chance to take.

2739
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:03,980
Ah, whatever.

2740
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:05,160
Don't worry about the noise.

2741
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:06,180
We're safe here.

2742
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:07,040
Don't say that.

2743
02:55:08,820 --> 02:55:17,700
room for many many years now there is no shadow in the
well-lit room the hour is fail-safe and all the bulbs are

2744
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:27,500
numbered and changed regularly based on their make and model
oh my god it's the well-lit room yeah nothing can go wrong

2745
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:37,040
in the well-lit room I guess we're gonna make our game plan
in here and then there's an old army base at raincoat point

2746
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:44,280
north of here it was active during the second world war they
operated here back then they must have built this yes they

2747
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:50,340
did it's my place now i stole it it's my precious

2748
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:02,040
what if it stops being well lit never it couldn't it
couldn't whoa then i won't need to worry about the room

2749
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:09,300
anymore because six and 33 and 118 need changing soon and i
don't want to climb up the ladder to change them because

2750
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:11,160
it's very late I'm tired.

2751
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:14,080
And if you take it, I won't have to do that anymore.

2752
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:18,140
That's so well it.

2753
02:56:18,140 --> 02:56:19,420
The page was autobiographical.

2754
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:21,140
A memory from my childhood.

2755
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:22,940
But I didn't write this.

2756
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:24,900
It was a page written by Thomas Zane.

2757
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:25,680
Thomas Zane?

2758
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,380
None of them were supposed to exist anymore.

2759
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:31,960
Alan, seven years old, would fight sleep to the bitter end.

2760
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:37,620
When he did sleep, he soon woke up, screaming that
nightmares fresh in his mind.

2761
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:39,020
Light bulbs.

2762
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:40,680
One evening, his mother said...

2763
02:56:40,700 --> 02:56:47,220
never been to the lighting section of a home depot she
called it the clicker and clicking the switch would turn on

2764
02:56:47,220 --> 02:56:53,940
a magical light that would drive the beast away yes yes to
imbue the talisman with all possible power she added that it

2765
02:56:53,940 --> 02:57:00,700
had been given to her by Alan's father Alan never knew him
and anything of his took on mythical proportions in his mind

2766
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:08,060
wait so I can click the button am I gonna become all
powerful slept like a baby now almost 30 years later Alan

2767
02:57:08,060 --> 02:57:12,760
thought of this as he stood on the rim of Holdren Lake, the
clicker in his hand.

2768
02:57:13,620 --> 02:57:16,200
He took a deep breath and jumped.

2769
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:17,640
My mind swirled.

2770
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:20,600
I'd given the clicker to Alice, yet it was here.

2771
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:24,500
Zane had written it into existence in a story I had written.

2772
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:30,160
I can get to her now.

2773
02:57:30,360 --> 02:57:31,300
I can finish this.

2774
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:31,860
Yeah!

2775
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:35,760
Shut the door.

2776
02:57:35,900 --> 02:57:36,840
Oh, watch your foot.

2777
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:39,440
Yeah!

2778
02:57:45,470 --> 02:57:47,150
Oh my gosh.

2779
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:55,500
End of episode 5.

2780
02:57:58,220 --> 02:57:59,580
We got the clicker, baby.

2781
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:05,180
I am going to run real quick and grab...

2782
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:07,580
I have some food that I was like...

2783
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:11,460
I just know how to grab it so I can eat it and have a little
snack before episode 6.

2784
02:58:13,880 --> 02:58:15,060
One second, I'll be right back.

2785
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:16,120
No DMs here.

2786
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:16,980
Yeah, I'll just leave it running.

2787
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:18,500
So you can leave, listen.

2788
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:56,100
Ah, yeah.

2789
02:58:58,060 --> 02:58:58,620
Look at that.

2790
02:58:58,740 --> 02:58:59,360
Thank you.

2791
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:02,620
I'm just going to eat some of this real quick and then...

2792
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:13,100
One thing that's good about coffee is it keeps me focused.

2793
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:13,880
Well, not focused.

2794
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:14,940
It keeps me...

2795
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,520
But then it also makes me so hungry.

2796
02:59:25,820 --> 02:59:27,460
Outside of Alan Wake, they make good music.

2797
02:59:27,580 --> 02:59:28,740
What's the band called again?

2798
02:59:38,810 --> 02:59:40,170
Poets of the Fall.

2799
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:48,840
Caffeine is supposed to be an appetite suppressor?

2800
02:59:49,240 --> 02:59:51,000
Not for me.

2801
02:59:51,140 --> 02:59:55,780
It makes my metabolism go I'm a hungry ghost.

2802
03:00:05,430 --> 03:00:06,730
They did music for Max Payne too.

2803
03:00:06,910 --> 03:00:07,450
That's so awesome.

2804
03:00:09,210 --> 03:00:10,270
Studio just really likes them.

2805
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,640
Same, I drink coffee and I get ravenous.

2806
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:21,040
Yeah!

2807
03:00:31,730 --> 03:00:32,290
Koi!

2808
03:00:32,390 --> 03:00:33,130
Happy birthday!

2809
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:38,570
I've been playing MGSV with the subsistence mod and so Minto
mods, Minto mods!

2810
03:00:38,750 --> 03:00:40,810
So much fun!

2811
03:00:41,110 --> 03:00:41,890
Happy birthday!

2812
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:42,670
What am I?

2813
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:44,210
Happy birthday Koi!

2814
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:48,950
I'm glad you're having fun with it.

2815
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:06,440
Is the last chapter super duper long or is it about the
same?

2816
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,260
This chapter wasn't so bad.

2817
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:40,040
slightly shorter a few hours still okay all good i was like
i if i if we were going 10 hours today i was ready for it so

2818
03:01:40,040 --> 03:01:47,040
i was that's why i was like we'll start early we'll go we'll
go we'll go to the end

2819
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:52,800
but doesn't seem like we'll need to do that

2820
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:03,480
probably a lot of fights i bet Probably.

2821
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:07,880
It's selfish, but I hope it takes longer.

2822
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:09,920
Oh, do you want to hang out with me?

2823
03:02:10,900 --> 03:02:12,420
Little needy eyeball.

2824
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:17,460
DLC will continue.

2825
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,380
The story will be another stream.

2826
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:21,600
Oh, yes, the DLC will be another stream.

2827
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:22,540
Yeah, yeah.

2828
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:24,260
Most likely.

2829
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:25,560
How do I think about it?

2830
03:02:27,900 --> 03:02:28,500
Probably.

2831
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:34,280
Previously on Alan Wake, a horror story that has come true.

2832
03:02:34,320 --> 03:02:35,900
Thomas Zane did the same in the 70s.

2833
03:02:35,900 --> 03:02:37,820
That's a crazy interpose of the fall when he's giving up.

2834
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:41,940
If I continue like the dark presence wants me to, the story
I'm writing won't save Alice.

2835
03:02:42,420 --> 03:02:43,240
It's a horror story.

2836
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:45,240
Power balance while Mid beats his peak.

2837
03:02:45,980 --> 03:02:47,400
You're the lady of the light.

2838
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:49,020
You're the lady of the light.

2839
03:02:49,220 --> 03:02:49,720
You must have been behind to help me.

2840
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:50,700
The clicker.

2841
03:02:51,020 --> 03:02:54,380
Alan thought of this as he stood on the rim of Cauldron
Lake.

2842
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:55,640
The clicker in his hand.

2843
03:02:55,860 --> 03:02:58,320
He took a deep breath and jumped.

2844
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:00,360
I can get to her now.

2845
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:01,480
I can finish this.

2846
03:03:02,500 --> 03:03:05,360
Is there a romance happening between Barry and the sheriff?

2847
03:03:10,040 --> 03:03:11,080
Because it...

2848
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:11,780
Hudson River.

2849
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:13,180
New York.

2850
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:14,660
Two years ago.

2851
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:17,520
No.

2852
03:03:23,370 --> 03:03:23,890
Barif?

2853
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:25,390
They have a ship name?

2854
03:03:26,750 --> 03:03:28,110
What's he doing with his arm like that?

2855
03:03:28,770 --> 03:03:32,130
My head was about to explode and the light hurt my eyes.

2856
03:03:32,930 --> 03:03:35,690
I needed my sunglasses and painkillers to dull the pain.

2857
03:03:35,710 --> 03:03:37,450
He was like pretending to hold a gun.

2858
03:03:37,470 --> 03:03:40,930
In one of my finer moments of self-deception, I swore to
quit drinking.

2859
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:42,210
Alan.

2860
03:03:42,930 --> 03:03:43,490
Alan?

2861
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:46,650
Alan, no self-control.

2862
03:03:47,210 --> 03:03:47,330
Oh.

2863
03:03:49,230 --> 03:03:50,910
Where is my sunglasses?

2864
03:03:50,930 --> 03:03:53,490
I wasn't sure if I could face the world without my
sunglasses.

2865
03:03:53,950 --> 03:03:55,090
And something for my headache.

2866
03:03:55,430 --> 03:03:56,410
Oh my god, it's so bright.

2867
03:03:57,610 --> 03:03:57,950
Ooh.

2868
03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:03,380
Oh my gosh.

2869
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,880
The pills worked fast.

2870
03:04:08,540 --> 03:04:18,580
started to seem bearable again this tiny tiny little washing
machine I'll never forget no water I can't I don't know how

2871
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:30,050
people can do that oh there's my sunglasses oh Alan cool the
sunglasses made the world look bearable now I could keep my

2872
03:04:30,050 --> 03:04:35,790
eyes open without feeling like a vampire in the Sun did it
actually or did they just turn down the brightness because

2873
03:04:35,790 --> 03:04:38,910
it almost feels like they was a message waiting for me on
the machine.

2874
03:04:41,130 --> 03:04:45,190
It almost feels like they actually darkened it a little bit.

2875
03:04:46,570 --> 03:04:46,770
Yeah.

2876
03:04:47,490 --> 03:04:48,210
Our glasses.

2877
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:50,570
I'm just looking around a little bit.

2878
03:04:52,690 --> 03:04:53,930
Looking for a thermos.

2879
03:04:56,070 --> 03:04:56,630
Sorry.

2880
03:04:58,490 --> 03:04:59,830
I have an obsession.

2881
03:05:01,430 --> 03:05:03,590
I have a problem and I recognize it.

2882
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:04,630
Okay.

2883
03:05:05,990 --> 03:05:06,550
Okay.

2884
03:05:08,590 --> 03:05:09,070
Um...

2885
03:05:09,070 --> 03:05:10,890
You have one new message.

2886
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:11,470
Ow!

2887
03:05:12,130 --> 03:05:13,130
Are you still asleep?

2888
03:05:13,330 --> 03:05:13,810
Very.

2889
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:15,530
Wakey, wakey!

2890
03:05:15,910 --> 03:05:17,590
You should have your show on your TiVo.

2891
03:05:18,130 --> 03:05:23,130
If Alice wasn't too mad to record it, as she called me
earlier and really chewed me out.

2892
03:05:23,250 --> 03:05:26,150
Yeah, yeah, we went a little overboard last night.

2893
03:05:26,650 --> 03:05:28,990
But parties are a part of this business.

2894
03:05:29,910 --> 03:05:30,390
TiVo.

2895
03:05:30,510 --> 03:05:31,570
I'm saying this is your friend.

2896
03:05:31,970 --> 03:05:36,210
She's not doing your career any favors by trying to run your
life like that, okay?

2897
03:05:37,090 --> 03:05:37,870
Talk to you later, Al.

2898
03:05:38,030 --> 03:05:38,850
Watch the show.

2899
03:05:39,210 --> 03:05:39,430
What?

2900
03:05:40,230 --> 03:05:41,890
Barry's like, divorce, babe.

2901
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:42,910
Divorce.

2902
03:05:44,890 --> 03:05:45,850
Where's the TV?

2903
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:46,370
Oh, here.

2904
03:05:51,350 --> 03:05:54,130
The Harry Barrett Show.

2905
03:05:54,650 --> 03:05:55,430
Garrett Show.

2906
03:05:56,070 --> 03:05:56,630
Garrett Show.

2907
03:05:57,210 --> 03:05:57,810
Bam.

2908
03:05:58,150 --> 03:05:58,670
Thank you.

2909
03:05:58,850 --> 03:05:59,950
Thank you, everybody.

2910
03:06:00,730 --> 03:06:03,290
We have a great show tonight.

2911
03:06:03,570 --> 03:06:04,350
I've been talking with...

2912
03:06:04,350 --> 03:06:04,950
This is our show.

2913
03:06:05,010 --> 03:06:05,550
Wait, is that?

2914
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:06,450
Oh!

2915
03:06:07,030 --> 03:06:08,590
The sudden stop.

2916
03:06:08,590 --> 03:06:13,150
Oh my gosh, it's Alan Wake in front of the green screen.

2917
03:06:14,010 --> 03:06:16,330
Look, I'm going to be honest here.

2918
03:06:16,430 --> 03:06:17,150
Is that wise?

2919
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:19,110
No, but I'm going to do it.

2920
03:06:19,110 --> 03:06:20,030
Is that wise?

2921
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:22,390
I think I would have punched this guy.

2922
03:06:23,450 --> 03:06:25,870
But this one, I actually read from cover to cover.

2923
03:06:26,130 --> 03:06:27,470
I mean, I'm a big fan.

2924
03:06:28,030 --> 03:06:28,830
Wow, thanks.

2925
03:06:29,430 --> 03:06:32,610
Now, this might be a spoiler for those who haven't read the
book yet.

2926
03:06:33,010 --> 03:06:36,710
Based on the sales figures, the two people out there who
haven't read the book yet.

2927
03:06:38,450 --> 03:06:46,610
this last book is all about the death of the main character
the hard-boiled New York oh no he kills off Alex Casey now

2928
03:06:46,610 --> 03:06:54,170
there's been a lot of outrage about this why the hell did
you kill Casey spoilers wait a second maybe not everybody

2929
03:06:54,170 --> 03:07:00,770
read the book no seriously though seven years and six books
is a long time he was a gloomy guy to spend all your working

2930
03:07:00,770 --> 03:07:07,210
hours with and it was a good run but it's time to explore
new things my next book will be a departure from the old for

2931
03:07:07,210 --> 03:07:14,410
me you selfish bastard always thinking of yourself now
you've certainly given us a lot of entertainment over the

2932
03:07:14,410 --> 03:07:22,830
years okay now that you mentioned it oh it's like the
fastest supplies ever with his love life with the ladies was

2933
03:07:22,830 --> 03:07:30,130
that autobiographical in anyway yeah no kidding casey's lady
friends tended to die on him with casey it was all about his

2934
03:07:30,130 --> 03:07:38,930
pain no nothing autobiographical about that i'm a happily
married man my wife is my muse My life is my muse.

2935
03:07:38,950 --> 03:07:40,510
That's great to hear.

2936
03:07:40,970 --> 03:07:43,450
So, how's the publicity tour been treating you?

2937
03:07:43,630 --> 03:07:43,830
Good?

2938
03:07:44,250 --> 03:07:44,490
Great.

2939
03:07:45,230 --> 03:07:47,570
But I gotta say, I'm glad to be back home in New York.

2940
03:07:47,950 --> 03:07:51,430
With the glasses on, he kinda looks like the guy who made
the room.

2941
03:07:54,970 --> 03:07:55,210
Ooh.

2942
03:07:56,350 --> 03:07:56,810
Ooh.

2943
03:07:58,110 --> 03:07:58,570
Ooh.

2944
03:07:59,170 --> 03:08:01,310
Well, that guy was really in my face.

2945
03:08:01,650 --> 03:08:02,350
Tommy, why so?

2946
03:08:02,550 --> 03:08:02,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2947
03:08:02,910 --> 03:08:03,630
I know that wasn't cool.

2948
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:06,190
Well, you are famous for that temper.

2949
03:08:06,710 --> 03:08:08,870
I'm trying to show you the first, but my head is annoyed.

2950
03:08:10,570 --> 03:08:11,230
See you.

2951
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:16,750
Well, your latest novel is called The Sudden Stop, and it's
in bookstores now.

2952
03:08:17,150 --> 03:08:18,140
Go get it.

2953
03:08:18,710 --> 03:08:21,310
That means the two of you out there who haven't bought it
yet.

2954
03:08:22,130 --> 03:08:23,910
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all we have for you tonight.

2955
03:08:23,970 --> 03:08:24,830
I did now.

2956
03:08:24,890 --> 03:08:27,750
I want to thank all our guests for the evening, Alan Wake,
Sam Lake.

2957
03:08:28,310 --> 03:08:29,850
What's more, do the face work, Sam?

2958
03:08:31,670 --> 03:08:34,590
And our musical guests, Sam Lake?

2959
03:08:34,890 --> 03:08:35,410
Thank you.

2960
03:08:36,710 --> 03:08:38,210
At least I've been funny.

2961
03:08:38,230 --> 03:08:40,230
Oh my gosh, it's Bo, it's on the phone!

2962
03:08:40,710 --> 03:08:45,610
Oh my gosh, I didn't say anything stupid if that's what you
want to know.

2963
03:08:46,310 --> 03:08:47,030
Okay, grumpy.

2964
03:08:47,530 --> 03:08:48,710
You want an aspirin or something?

2965
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:50,850
Are you going to start with me about drinking now?

2966
03:08:51,270 --> 03:08:51,790
You know what?

2967
03:08:52,270 --> 03:08:53,350
Go back to sleep, Alan.

2968
03:08:53,490 --> 03:08:56,030
Why are you being such a do-do head?

2969
03:08:56,170 --> 03:08:56,730
Oh my gosh.

2970
03:08:56,990 --> 03:08:57,930
I did not hear her.

2971
03:08:58,090 --> 03:08:58,530
I did not.

2972
03:08:58,990 --> 03:09:00,010
Now you can't even talk to me?

2973
03:09:00,070 --> 03:09:04,830
Well, this morning I was angry because you said you'd be
home at midnight and you showed up at 7 a.m.

2974
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:06,330
and passed out in mid-sentence.

2975
03:09:06,870 --> 03:09:08,150
Now I'm over it.

2976
03:09:08,270 --> 03:09:08,850
Are you angry?

2977
03:09:09,110 --> 03:09:10,190
This goddamn tour.

2978
03:09:10,770 --> 03:09:11,830
It's gotten out of hand.

2979
03:09:12,730 --> 03:09:13,230
Oh, honey.

2980
03:09:14,230 --> 03:09:15,590
It's almost over, right?

2981
03:09:16,230 --> 03:09:17,410
We can get back to normal.

2982
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:18,710
And you can start writing again.

2983
03:09:18,710 --> 03:09:19,290
Do the face again.

2984
03:09:20,070 --> 03:09:21,050
I'm sorry, honey.

2985
03:09:22,010 --> 03:09:23,950
Alan, you're not thinking straight.

2986
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:26,470
Just take a shower and go back to bed, huh?

2987
03:09:27,230 --> 03:09:27,670
How old?

2988
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:28,830
Yeah, you're right, honey.

2989
03:09:29,070 --> 03:09:30,590
How old is Alan?

2990
03:09:30,710 --> 03:09:32,570
Once this is over, let's go away together.

2991
03:09:33,210 --> 03:09:33,790
I'll vacation.

2992
03:09:34,110 --> 03:09:35,210
Just you and me.

2993
03:09:35,390 --> 03:09:36,190
Some peace and quiet.

2994
03:09:38,210 --> 03:09:40,910
The lady kept calling him young man.

2995
03:09:43,730 --> 03:09:44,770
His 30s.

2996
03:09:45,690 --> 03:09:45,990
Rough.

2997
03:09:49,610 --> 03:09:49,950
Present day.

2998
03:09:50,910 --> 03:09:52,430
The clicker was the key to the cabin.

2999
03:09:53,010 --> 03:09:55,170
I had to return to Carbon Lake to save Alice.

3000
03:09:56,690 --> 03:09:58,010
Yeah, plans to stream Alan Wake 2?

3001
03:09:58,410 --> 03:10:00,270
Yeah, that's why I started Alan Wake 1.

3002
03:10:02,850 --> 03:10:05,110
I'm going back to the lake to finish this.

3003
03:10:05,110 --> 03:10:11,010
I'm going to write an ending to the story in the manuscript
on my own terms to make it all right Why can't you just

3004
03:10:11,010 --> 03:10:11,810
write it here?

3005
03:10:12,030 --> 03:10:13,950
The last page is still in the typewriter.

3006
03:10:14,070 --> 03:10:15,710
I need to read it first.

3007
03:10:15,810 --> 03:10:17,530
Everything needs to be just right.

3008
03:10:17,770 --> 03:10:20,390
Zane tried to cut some corners And it didn't end well.

3009
03:10:20,770 --> 03:10:22,170
Okay, ready when you are.

3010
03:10:22,330 --> 03:10:25,350
Yeah, we're the team I'm sorry, Sarah, but I need to do this
alone.

3011
03:10:25,590 --> 03:10:27,050
No, Barry take her gun.

3012
03:10:27,210 --> 03:10:28,030
Oh my god.

3013
03:10:28,270 --> 03:10:28,630
Why?

3014
03:10:28,790 --> 03:10:30,450
Miss Weaver closed the door when I leave.

3015
03:10:30,630 --> 03:10:30,890
What?

3016
03:10:32,070 --> 03:10:32,470
What?

3017
03:10:36,650 --> 03:10:54,050
what what what good luck Alan why Alan why why see you later
what I'm about to I can't deal I can't take this man anymore

3018
03:10:54,050 --> 03:11:01,530
when I got out it was wool and sunny I'd flick the switch of
the clicker had it done this I didn't stop to question it I

3019
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:08,710
had to take advantage of the sunlight to get to the lake on
zane's page i'd stood on the rim of cauldron lake about to

3020
03:11:08,710 --> 03:11:17,850
use the clicker that's where i was headed imagine the game
is like okay now backtrack from the beginning

3021
03:11:23,030 --> 03:11:26,770
i'm so angry right now we had the dream team the three of us

3022
03:11:33,490 --> 03:11:40,910
the pacific northwest landscape it was hard not to let doubt
creep in one last time i could still chalk everything up to

3023
03:11:40,910 --> 03:11:47,070
a dream a delusion i had enough imagination to make up
something like this what having been in the cabin all this

3024
03:11:47,070 --> 03:11:54,050
time trapped in a story inside my head gone mad from grief
over alice's death like hartman had claimed there would be

3025
03:11:54,050 --> 03:12:04,970
no way of knowing i told myself it didn't really matter my
course was set no i was just kidding when i said we We have

3026
03:12:04,970 --> 03:12:05,230
to...

3027
03:12:05,230 --> 03:12:06,150
I was just kidding you.

3028
03:12:06,190 --> 03:12:08,210
I said we have to go all the way back to...

3029
03:12:08,210 --> 03:12:09,670
I was just kidding about that.

3030
03:12:12,570 --> 03:12:15,090
Visit the haunted witches ladle.

3031
03:12:15,370 --> 03:12:15,570
What?

3032
03:12:16,190 --> 03:12:17,130
I want to go there.

3033
03:12:18,190 --> 03:12:20,790
Someone that just turned 34 that cut deep, Minto.

3034
03:12:21,030 --> 03:12:21,370
Sorry.

3035
03:12:23,930 --> 03:12:25,590
No, I don't mean it.

3036
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:26,770
Sorry.

3037
03:12:26,890 --> 03:12:27,610
You have to forgive me.

3038
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:31,090
I mean, to be fair, I'm still 19.

3039
03:12:32,290 --> 03:12:33,290
Everybody's old to me.

3040
03:12:36,390 --> 03:12:38,110
How long have we been 19?

3041
03:12:39,230 --> 03:12:39,810
A while.

3042
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:45,280
Wow, look at that view.

3043
03:12:46,980 --> 03:12:48,540
Wow, wow!

3044
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:52,240
That's the PNW.

3045
03:12:52,320 --> 03:12:53,200
Scenic area!

3046
03:12:55,860 --> 03:12:58,980
Also, aka a place to buy a new car.

3047
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:01,060
I mean, not buy.

3048
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:01,880
Fine.

3049
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:06,640
Oh, why would you leave your car here at the scenic area,
you dummy dumb?

3050
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:12,100
I can't believe we actually are having to...

3051
03:13:12,100 --> 03:13:13,160
Oh my god.

3052
03:13:14,560 --> 03:13:18,040
But it's daytime, so I will stop and I will grab things.

3053
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:19,320
Did I just knock that over?

3054
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:23,380
Alan Vandalize!

3055
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:27,260
The Majestic Motel.

3056
03:13:27,780 --> 03:13:29,340
Just down the road, come on in!

3057
03:13:30,220 --> 03:13:32,000
Kitchenette in every room!

3058
03:13:32,360 --> 03:13:32,820
Nice.

3059
03:13:34,160 --> 03:13:36,200
Oh, oh, okay, nope, it's still daylight.

3060
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:39,700
Don't let the game fool you.

3061
03:13:41,500 --> 03:13:42,820
They were like...

3062
03:13:42,820 --> 03:13:45,220
They were like, oh, it's daylight, you said?

3063
03:13:46,340 --> 03:13:47,600
Nah, we're just kidding, it is.

3064
03:13:49,380 --> 03:13:50,380
Nah, we're just kidding.

3065
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:51,420
We're just joshing.

3066
03:13:53,440 --> 03:13:53,920
Logging.

3067
03:13:55,460 --> 03:13:57,140
Oh, what if you want another car?

3068
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:02,400
I cannot believe.

3069
03:14:10,210 --> 03:14:11,610
Do I have a map?

3070
03:14:11,630 --> 03:14:12,190
No.

3071
03:14:12,970 --> 03:14:15,950
I just have the little yellow dot to guide me.

3072
03:14:17,710 --> 03:14:19,030
Oh, we couldn't go this way anyway.

3073
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:19,930
Why was that?

3074
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:26,880
This thing is so rusty except that one white part at the
top.

3075
03:14:28,280 --> 03:14:28,300
Wow.

3076
03:14:31,540 --> 03:14:32,420
Alan Explorer!

3077
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:38,000
Easter eggs.

3078
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:40,180
Can you take the loader?

3079
03:14:40,300 --> 03:14:40,840
Which was that?

3080
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:41,420
Is that this?

3081
03:14:45,680 --> 03:14:46,340
Oh wait.

3082
03:14:46,480 --> 03:14:47,540
There's a little shack over here.

3083
03:14:47,560 --> 03:14:47,700
there?

3084
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:48,240
Hold on.

3085
03:14:48,560 --> 03:14:50,500
Sorry, I am trying to search for supplies and stuff.

3086
03:14:50,960 --> 03:14:52,100
And manuscript pages.

3087
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:55,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-huh.

3088
03:14:56,780 --> 03:14:58,240
Search and you shall be rewarded.

3089
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:00,440
See?

3090
03:15:03,640 --> 03:15:04,120
Okay.

3091
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,500
I was right here.

3092
03:15:05,640 --> 03:15:08,000
I completely blind.

3093
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:09,460
The VTuber is blind.

3094
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:14,920
I don't know why the game is kind of glitching out on me.

3095
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:16,820
Let's switch cars.

3096
03:15:19,060 --> 03:15:24,120
I love Alan Wake GTA mod.

3097
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:25,100
So great.

3098
03:15:29,080 --> 03:15:31,580
I mean, there's nobody on these streets anyway.

3099
03:15:34,960 --> 03:15:37,520
Why do I have to worry about it?

3100
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:39,400
Oh.

3101
03:15:46,070 --> 03:15:47,690
Oh, what's here?

3102
03:15:55,340 --> 03:15:56,280
Alan Theft.

3103
03:15:56,800 --> 03:15:57,940
Yeah, Alan Theft Auto.

3104
03:15:59,440 --> 03:16:00,620
Grand Theft Allen.

3105
03:16:03,100 --> 03:16:03,720
GTI!

3106
03:16:03,880 --> 03:16:04,380
GTI!

3107
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:07,840
Is there

3108
03:16:10,930 --> 03:16:11,850
anything even in here?

3109
03:16:12,190 --> 03:16:12,310
Oh!

3110
03:16:12,890 --> 03:16:14,770
Shut up, a thermos.

3111
03:16:17,090 --> 03:16:18,350
But I meant inside the house.

3112
03:16:18,570 --> 03:16:19,630
How do you get inside?

3113
03:16:23,350 --> 03:16:24,330
Ah, fascinating.

3114
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:33,470
I guess it's the boarded up room or door, I mean.

3115
03:16:37,090 --> 03:16:42,170
Bright Falls, Deer Festival, cuisine, trophies, hunting,
family fun.

3116
03:16:43,410 --> 03:16:46,450
That looks like one of those billboards that they just leave
up all year.

3117
03:16:46,630 --> 03:16:47,990
You think I can push through here?

3118
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:14,890
That was extremely...

3119
03:17:16,110 --> 03:17:17,770
The darkness had touched me.

3120
03:17:18,350 --> 03:17:19,550
There was a link between us.

3121
03:17:19,730 --> 03:17:20,430
Always would be.

3122
03:17:20,830 --> 03:17:23,010
I could feel its presence again getting closer.

3123
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:26,250
I have no car anymore!

3124
03:17:26,590 --> 03:17:27,770
Can I drive this one?

3125
03:17:29,610 --> 03:17:30,150
Damn.

3126
03:17:31,090 --> 03:17:31,810
Dang it.

3127
03:17:34,210 --> 03:17:35,770
What's that in the middle of the road?

3128
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:43,140
Oh.

3129
03:17:43,140 --> 03:17:44,700
I will kill your wife.

3130
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:46,080
Oh, come on.

3131
03:17:49,420 --> 03:17:49,960
Oh!

3132
03:17:55,230 --> 03:17:56,010
What just happened?

3133
03:17:56,770 --> 03:17:58,350
Did my finger slip and I didn't realize?

3134
03:18:03,640 --> 03:18:05,060
I didn't press it, though.

3135
03:18:08,200 --> 03:18:08,680
Funky.

3136
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:13,120
I will kill your wife.

3137
03:18:15,240 --> 03:18:15,740
Magic?

3138
03:18:17,100 --> 03:18:18,260
Probably me messing up.

3139
03:18:18,620 --> 03:18:18,880
My bad.

3140
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:21,460
The Dark Presence wants to stop Wake.

3141
03:18:21,580 --> 03:18:26,180
The Dark Presence was no longer trying to capture the writer
so he could create the ending it wanted.

3142
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:27,860
The writer knew too much.

3143
03:18:28,220 --> 03:18:28,960
The Clicker.

3144
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:31,880
And he carried a weapon left behind by Thomas Zane.

3145
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:33,380
Something that could hurt it.

3146
03:18:35,200 --> 03:18:40,960
was doing everything in its power to simply stop the rider
from ever reaching Calderon Lake and the dark place it came

3147
03:18:40,960 --> 03:18:41,500
from.

3148
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:46,720
Whoa, look how many pages there are that I can't get.

3149
03:18:46,940 --> 03:18:48,540
Oh, there's only, there's so few actually.

3150
03:18:51,460 --> 03:18:52,220
No, my light!

3151
03:18:52,340 --> 03:18:55,240
Wait, I don't have a clicker.

3152
03:19:01,640 --> 03:19:03,220
I could drive this though, right?

3153
03:19:04,180 --> 03:19:05,220
Oh yeah!

3154
03:19:09,440 --> 03:19:13,220
I wanted it to be daytime when we went back to the lake.

3155
03:19:22,180 --> 03:19:25,440
Another abandoned car, another abandoned car.

3156
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:29,620
That one doesn't look like it's such a good condition.

3157
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:52,540
Can I go this way?

3158
03:20:00,540 --> 03:20:00,780
Uh.

3159
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:21,100
Getting Grand Theft Allen before GTA 6 is crazy.

3160
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:22,260
Can I go in?

3161
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:24,860
Oh, nice.

3162
03:20:25,420 --> 03:20:26,020
Checkpoint.

3163
03:20:26,580 --> 03:20:26,800
Exam.

3164
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:32,800
Based on the signature in the motel register, Agent
Nightingale had stayed here in room number two.

3165
03:20:32,900 --> 03:20:33,000
Oh.

3166
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:36,620
Oh.

3167
03:20:38,680 --> 03:20:41,220
Do we want the shotgun or the hunting rifle?

3168
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:42,240
Wait.

3169
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:47,120
I think the hunting rifle is good.

3170
03:20:52,320 --> 03:20:54,020
The Majestic Motel.

3171
03:20:54,180 --> 03:20:54,860
General Info.

3172
03:20:54,940 --> 03:20:55,640

Mr. No oh

3178
03:21:43,220 --> 03:21:48,400
he slept with photos of of Barry

3179
03:21:52,020 --> 03:22:04,850
uh okay this guy is God right he's dead dead or It had
obviously been the room where Agent Nightingale had stayed

3180
03:22:04,850 --> 03:22:06,790
when he hadn't been busy harassing me.

3181
03:22:16,580 --> 03:22:19,120
He kept the sheet so perfect.

3182
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:22,580
But he slept with no pillow.

3183
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:25,340
This guy is a freak.

3184
03:22:27,660 --> 03:22:30,420
How would he feel right now knowing that I'm in his bed?

3185
03:22:33,020 --> 03:22:35,760
One little monkey jumping on the bed.

3186
03:22:37,940 --> 03:22:38,400
Hey!

3187
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:45,400
Oh my god!

3188
03:22:49,820 --> 03:22:50,720
Where'd he go?

3189
03:22:51,080 --> 03:22:52,280
Oh, I killed him.

3190
03:23:02,890 --> 03:23:04,290
I'm in the light.

3191
03:23:05,090 --> 03:23:05,950
La la la la la la.

3192
03:23:07,150 --> 03:23:07,550
Okay.

3193
03:23:14,420 --> 03:23:16,100
Can I go into any other rooms?

3194
03:23:17,200 --> 03:23:17,760
Okay.

3195
03:23:17,780 --> 03:23:18,360
Dang.

3196
03:23:19,360 --> 03:23:20,700
People actually lock their doors.

3197
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:22,700
Insane information.

3198
03:23:28,270 --> 03:23:29,390
Can I...

3199
03:23:29,390 --> 03:23:29,710
Oh.

3200
03:23:30,090 --> 03:23:31,150
Oh, you are still here.

3201
03:23:35,030 --> 03:23:36,030
And you too.

3202
03:23:38,290 --> 03:23:39,810
Oh my god!

3203
03:23:40,090 --> 03:23:41,430
I did it again!

3204
03:23:41,550 --> 03:23:42,670
What's wrong with me?

3205
03:23:43,450 --> 03:23:44,510
So my gosh.

3206
03:23:44,610 --> 03:23:45,450
I need to unequip.

3207
03:23:46,230 --> 03:23:47,090
Why do I...

3208
03:23:47,090 --> 03:23:49,990
Why have I suddenly started, like, pressing this instead of
dodging?

3209
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:57,230
I'm so stupid I've like trained myself in the worst way Ah

3210
03:24:03,410 --> 03:24:05,050
Beep Beep

3211
03:24:09,280 --> 03:24:19,650
At least it works I know but the flashbangs are so pricey
Let's see if there's anything over there Okay let's just go

3212
03:24:22,880 --> 03:24:24,000
Oh I

3213
03:24:31,410 --> 03:24:34,990
think I'm safe right here Oh

3214
03:24:39,070 --> 03:24:39,590
Hello?

3215
03:24:41,930 --> 03:24:42,350
Okay.

3216
03:24:42,710 --> 03:24:43,490
Checkpoint reached!

3217
03:24:46,410 --> 03:24:48,930
I'm like getting my, what's it called?

3218
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:49,910
It's all mixed up.

3219
03:24:50,030 --> 03:24:51,410
I'm pressing like all the wrong buttons.

3220
03:24:54,150 --> 03:24:55,530
What the heck is wrong with me?

3221
03:24:57,490 --> 03:24:58,930
As long as they give me more.

3222
03:25:01,210 --> 03:25:01,610
Eventually.

3223
03:25:17,080 --> 03:25:17,540
Where'd he go?

3224
03:25:17,700 --> 03:25:17,780
There we go.

3225
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:27,780
You would think whatever is flashing in my face would be
enough light to take care of the...

3226
03:25:29,260 --> 03:25:29,640
Ah!

3227
03:25:36,210 --> 03:25:36,850
Bully!

3228
03:25:38,050 --> 03:25:38,270
Yeah!

3229
03:25:38,970 --> 03:25:39,250
Sure.

3230
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:47,800
What?

3231
03:25:49,100 --> 03:25:49,500
What?

3232
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:51,620
Are you okay?

3233
03:25:52,060 --> 03:25:52,680
Are you evil?

3234
03:25:54,160 --> 03:25:55,040
Oh, everything's evil.

3235
03:25:56,480 --> 03:25:57,200
Of course you are.

3236
03:25:57,620 --> 03:25:58,880
Oh my god!

3237
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:01,760
Fight past the poltergeists.

3238
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:03,260
It's kind of fun.

3239
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:05,280
What is this?

3240
03:26:07,440 --> 03:26:08,480
Is that a light?

3241
03:26:08,660 --> 03:26:09,480
Is that a manuscript?

3242
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:10,140
What is this?

3243
03:26:13,980 --> 03:26:15,040
I'm gonna die.

3244
03:26:16,020 --> 03:26:17,220
From these freaking things.

3245
03:26:24,620 --> 03:26:25,420
Is it a page?

3246
03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:26,260
I can't tell.

3247
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:28,760
Yeah, it looks like one, right?

3248
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:30,280
Ugh.

3249
03:26:33,740 --> 03:26:34,400
What?

3250
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:36,080
What is?

3251
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:37,860
Is it a light?

3252
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:40,700
I think it's a light.

3253
03:26:41,740 --> 03:26:42,660
Oh, it's a light.

3254
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:44,340
That's so funny.

3255
03:26:45,860 --> 03:26:46,620
That's so silly.

3256
03:26:56,520 --> 03:26:57,300
Now in jump.

3257
03:26:58,060 --> 03:27:01,300
Oh, dodge!

3258
03:27:05,770 --> 03:27:06,130
Okay.

3259
03:27:15,170 --> 03:27:17,380
I think there was something behind me.

3260
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:26,440
Dodge, dodge, dodge!

3261
03:27:26,680 --> 03:27:27,900
Ah, geez.

3262
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:31,180
Where's the other one?

3263
03:27:31,340 --> 03:27:31,800
Right here.

3264
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,000
Yeah!

3265
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:40,620
I think there was something behind me, but,

3266
03:27:44,480 --> 03:27:45,100
uh...

3267
03:27:45,100 --> 03:27:45,460
Woo!

3268
03:27:53,240 --> 03:27:54,060
You.

3269
03:27:54,660 --> 03:27:54,980
Oh.

3270
03:27:56,620 --> 03:27:57,820
Oh, dang it!

3271
03:28:03,560 --> 03:28:04,660
Oh, that was close.

3272
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:07,840
That was close.

3273
03:28:08,720 --> 03:28:12,040
Hold on, I'm letting my health regen a little bit on my
battery.

3274
03:28:12,260 --> 03:28:12,740
Okay, we're good.

3275
03:28:19,860 --> 03:28:23,100
Oh, shoot.

3276
03:28:23,360 --> 03:28:23,720
Oh, shoot.

3277
03:28:24,040 --> 03:28:24,340
Oh, my God.

3278
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:25,100
Please, let me move.

3279
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:25,620
I'm trying.

3280
03:28:29,100 --> 03:28:29,700
Is it...

3281
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:30,720
Which part is it?

3282
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:32,060
Woo!

3283
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:39,520
George!

3284
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:41,720
Road, road, road!

3285
03:28:46,970 --> 03:28:48,390
Is that just a...

3286
03:28:48,390 --> 03:28:50,590
a square of...

3287
03:28:50,590 --> 03:28:51,270
of light?

3288
03:28:53,510 --> 03:28:55,830
Oh my god, they gave us a new car.

3289
03:28:57,090 --> 03:28:57,470
Awesome.

3290
03:29:05,230 --> 03:29:06,510
This is ridiculous.

3291
03:29:08,010 --> 03:29:09,310
All during Deer Festival.

3292
03:29:10,910 --> 03:29:13,290
They couldn't have picked the worst time, right?

3293
03:29:13,610 --> 03:29:14,310
Oh my god!

3294
03:29:24,120 --> 03:29:25,740
But I'm stuck on the road.

3295
03:29:30,760 --> 03:29:31,600
Oh,

3296
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:35,300
uh...

3297
03:29:35,720 --> 03:29:36,600
Evil car!

3298
03:29:37,020 --> 03:29:38,440
Wait, it's a monster car!

3299
03:29:39,760 --> 03:29:40,160
Wait!

3300
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:43,400
Evil monster car!

3301
03:29:48,960 --> 03:29:49,800
Can

3302
03:29:56,260 --> 03:29:57,940
I get it still?

3303
03:30:02,500 --> 03:30:04,540
I'm going into the well-lit room.

3304
03:30:04,740 --> 03:30:05,900
Why is there a boat?

3305
03:30:10,220 --> 03:30:11,740
Oh, they all threw it once.

3306
03:30:11,860 --> 03:30:12,740
Did you see that?

3307
03:30:13,860 --> 03:30:16,140
The sequence throwing was crazy.

3308
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:17,760
Oh my gosh.

3309
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:29,960
I think it's stuck.

3310
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:33,600
Oh, my car is, like, not doing so hot.

3311
03:30:41,150 --> 03:30:41,710
Nice.

3312
03:30:56,140 --> 03:30:56,700
Oops.

3313
03:31:02,120 --> 03:31:03,420
Well lit barn!

3314
03:31:08,120 --> 03:31:09,260
What's up here anyway?

3315
03:31:09,380 --> 03:31:11,640
Why is it so...

3316
03:31:11,640 --> 03:31:13,040
What is shaken?

3317
03:31:13,120 --> 03:31:14,000
What is shaken bacon?

3318
03:31:14,680 --> 03:31:15,760
What's shaken so much?

3319
03:31:17,060 --> 03:31:18,600
I think I need to move this car.

3320
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:21,600
And get into the other car.

3321
03:31:22,600 --> 03:31:23,320
What is shaking?

3322
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:36,120
New car!

3323
03:31:38,780 --> 03:31:39,800
Probably the monster car.

3324
03:31:40,140 --> 03:31:41,040
I can't see anything.

3325
03:31:47,530 --> 03:31:49,150
I guess we keep going.

3326
03:31:50,970 --> 03:31:51,670
Awkward.

3327
03:31:55,230 --> 03:31:55,930
Awkward!

3328
03:31:56,590 --> 03:31:56,850
Alright.

3329
03:31:57,970 --> 03:31:58,470
Excuse me!

3330
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:08,230
It's still shaking, whatever it is.

3331
03:32:08,770 --> 03:32:09,550
You guys see that?

3332
03:32:10,350 --> 03:32:11,590
Maybe it's supposed to be the way.

3333
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:19,320
Holy cow.

3334
03:32:21,440 --> 03:32:22,700
Oh my gosh.

3335
03:32:25,260 --> 03:32:25,880
Holy cow.

3336
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:34,820
We did it.

3337
03:32:35,580 --> 03:32:36,260
Oh, no, my bad.

3338
03:32:47,890 --> 03:32:48,530
There we go.

3339
03:32:53,690 --> 03:32:54,630
Alan, no clip.

3340
03:32:58,210 --> 03:32:59,350
How much?

3341
03:33:02,270 --> 03:33:10,230
If I switch to this, 12 bullets over the 8 we have on the
hunting rifle.

3342
03:33:10,350 --> 03:33:12,310
I still think the hunting rifle is better though.

3343
03:33:13,390 --> 03:33:14,590
Pick up the flare, dummy.

3344
03:33:14,810 --> 03:33:15,330
Thank you.

3345
03:33:15,870 --> 03:33:17,350
Do we have any more cars or?

3346
03:33:18,210 --> 03:33:19,010
Oh, there's one.

3347
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:24,360
There's like, oh, wait.

3348
03:33:25,320 --> 03:33:25,500
No.

3349
03:33:28,820 --> 03:33:30,260
There are no more cars.

3350
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:30,780
Why?

3351
03:33:32,180 --> 03:33:32,420
Why?

3352
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:34,560
Why?

3353
03:33:35,160 --> 03:33:35,620
Why?

3354
03:33:36,320 --> 03:33:36,680
Why?

3355
03:33:39,890 --> 03:33:41,170
Maybe if I get rid of the goop.

3356
03:33:41,770 --> 03:33:43,270
Come on, please, let me drive.

3357
03:33:47,870 --> 03:33:49,610
I reached a checkpoint though.

3358
03:33:50,190 --> 03:33:51,750
I do see the flares there.

3359
03:33:58,360 --> 03:33:58,660
One second.

3360
03:33:59,320 --> 03:33:59,620
One second.

3361
03:34:02,340 --> 03:34:03,060
One second.

3362
03:34:16,110 --> 03:34:20,310
Sometimes, oh gosh, it really feels like sometimes that I'm
playing like Eternal Darkness, I'm not gonna lie.

3363
03:34:23,990 --> 03:34:26,250
I'm like what in the

3364
03:34:30,340 --> 03:34:32,680
Oh shit Oh

3365
03:34:43,640 --> 03:34:47,340
Stay away from me Stay away from me

3366
03:34:51,400 --> 03:34:53,940
That's right

3367
03:34:57,000 --> 03:35:06,700
It feels like my sanity is going crazy And making it so that
I Oh it's just Littered with stuff

3368
03:35:10,600 --> 03:35:15,280
Oh Oh my gosh.

3369
03:35:15,840 --> 03:35:17,360
Ow, just, ah!

3370
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:20,460
Oh my god.

3371
03:35:20,620 --> 03:35:21,600
I'm gonna die here.

3372
03:35:21,860 --> 03:35:22,630
I'm gonna die here.

3373
03:35:25,870 --> 03:35:26,730
Wow, Jesus!

3374
03:35:32,380 --> 03:35:33,140
That was tough.

3375
03:35:36,300 --> 03:35:37,520
Aw, man.

3376
03:35:39,540 --> 03:35:41,180
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

3377
03:35:42,360 --> 03:35:43,780
Alright, alright, alright.

3378
03:35:50,980 --> 03:35:51,640
Alright.

3379
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:52,180
Alright, alright.

3380
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:57,020
Wait, let's get this guy.

3381
03:35:57,880 --> 03:35:59,180
Oh, I'm too far away, I think.

3382
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:01,680
I don't want to like accidentally run into them, you know?

3383
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:07,120
There we go.

3384
03:36:10,020 --> 03:36:12,100
All right, all right, all right.

3385
03:36:15,620 --> 03:36:17,900
Modern camping equipment is...

3386
03:36:17,900 --> 03:36:19,460
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3387
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:22,620
That's right.

3388
03:36:23,780 --> 03:36:25,060
Little babies over there.

3389
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:26,420
Little baby?

3390
03:36:30,420 --> 03:36:34,100
Yeah, I don't even need to use two flares on you guys this
time.

3391
03:36:35,520 --> 03:36:36,100
That's right.

3392
03:36:36,940 --> 03:36:38,360
I don't even need to.

3393
03:36:43,170 --> 03:36:44,350
But this part scares me.

3394
03:36:45,350 --> 03:36:47,850
I will use the flares instead of the explodees.

3395
03:36:48,610 --> 03:36:50,190
Instead of the flashbangs, I think.

3396
03:36:51,670 --> 03:36:52,210
Okay.

3397
03:36:58,540 --> 03:36:59,060
F4.

3398
03:36:59,720 --> 03:37:00,260
AHHHHH!

3399
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:05,300
What the hell you weren't supposed to come yet?

3400
03:37:05,660 --> 03:37:06,200
AHHHHH!

3401
03:37:17,820 --> 03:37:20,260
Did they respawn or something or...

3402
03:37:36,520 --> 03:37:37,300
Oh shoot.

3403
03:37:42,810 --> 03:37:43,310
Ouch!

3404
03:37:44,190 --> 03:37:44,330
Ouch!

3405
03:37:44,490 --> 03:37:44,490
Ouch!

3406
03:37:44,650 --> 03:37:44,650
Please!

3407
03:37:44,810 --> 03:37:44,890
Please!

3408
03:37:45,090 --> 03:37:45,090
Please!

3409
03:37:49,790 --> 03:37:50,270
Oh my god.

3410
03:37:51,570 --> 03:37:52,150
Oh my god.

3411
03:37:52,450 --> 03:37:52,450
Please.

3412
03:37:52,770 --> 03:37:54,470
Let me... Oh my god.

3413
03:37:55,750 --> 03:37:56,250
Okay.

3414
03:37:56,950 --> 03:37:57,490
Oh geez.

3415
03:38:02,250 --> 03:38:02,790
What's happening?

3416
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:04,570
Why is it... Pick up the page.

3417
03:38:04,890 --> 03:38:05,210
And run.

3418
03:38:07,230 --> 03:38:08,190
Holy cow.

3419
03:38:09,610 --> 03:38:10,830
We made it.

3420
03:38:13,150 --> 03:38:13,750
We made it.

3421
03:38:13,870 --> 03:38:14,350
We made it.

3422
03:38:15,950 --> 03:38:16,130
Yahoo!

3423
03:38:16,650 --> 03:38:16,950
Okay.

3424
03:38:18,230 --> 03:38:19,230
And new car.

3425
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:20,210
Yippee!

3426
03:38:22,130 --> 03:38:23,450
Jeez, Louise.

3427
03:38:23,890 --> 03:38:24,650
I know, right?

3428
03:38:25,910 --> 03:38:27,790
They know how to get you in this game.

3429
03:38:28,550 --> 03:38:30,870
When will we get to Cauldron Lake?

3430
03:38:31,970 --> 03:38:32,430
For real.

3431
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:45,540
Auto salvage and used parts.

3432
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:49,100
Surely I can run through that, right?

3433
03:38:56,060 --> 03:38:57,140
We're going to tap it.

3434
03:38:57,220 --> 03:38:57,880
Love tap it.

3435
03:39:07,570 --> 03:39:08,450
Okay, anyway.

3436
03:39:10,590 --> 03:39:12,530
I don't think there was anything important up there.

3437
03:39:12,750 --> 03:39:12,990
Oh, wait.

3438
03:39:13,010 --> 03:39:13,950
Is that the way I need to go?

3439
03:39:18,710 --> 03:39:20,170
It's pointing to the right.

3440
03:39:31,710 --> 03:39:32,730
But that's a page.

3441
03:39:33,810 --> 03:39:35,350
It's a manuscript page, hold on.

3442
03:39:35,450 --> 03:39:36,890
What we're going to do is we're going to

3443
03:39:40,750 --> 03:39:42,750
make our getaway.

3444
03:39:46,930 --> 03:39:47,150
Alright.

3445
03:39:47,930 --> 03:39:48,690
Oh, please.

3446
03:39:49,230 --> 03:39:49,750
Okay.

3447
03:39:50,270 --> 03:39:51,170
Alright, there we go.

3448
03:39:53,810 --> 03:39:56,210
If anything comes and gets us after grabbing this.

3449
03:40:00,710 --> 03:40:01,390
Okay, nice.

3450
03:40:02,930 --> 03:40:03,310
Anyway.

3451
03:40:04,050 --> 03:40:04,410
Alright.

3452
03:40:04,990 --> 03:40:06,250
We'd have to do that anyway.

3453
03:40:06,950 --> 03:40:07,830
Oh, brrrrr.

3454
03:40:08,690 --> 03:40:10,030
Trail of the Dark Presence.

3455
03:40:10,150 --> 03:40:15,450
The bottom of Calderon Lake was a graveyard of things the
lake had claimed in one way or another over the decades.

3456
03:40:15,590 --> 03:40:16,070
Freaky!

3457
03:40:16,750 --> 03:40:18,610
The Dark Presence brought them up in its wake.

3458
03:40:18,950 --> 03:40:21,830
Scattering the rotten waterlogged hull of an old boat here.

3459
03:40:22,110 --> 03:40:24,510
The remains of a long ago crashed airplane there.

3460
03:40:24,910 --> 03:40:26,750
Trees shattered under the impacts.

3461
03:40:27,210 --> 03:40:27,990
The earth groaned.

3462
03:40:28,490 --> 03:40:29,430
It didn't even notice.

3463
03:40:29,890 --> 03:40:31,570
It didn't even notice.

3464
03:40:33,850 --> 03:40:34,130
Oh!

3465
03:40:34,950 --> 03:40:35,830
Wait, what is our...

3466
03:40:35,830 --> 03:40:38,070
Wake now knows that he can finish this and rescue Alice.

3467
03:40:38,170 --> 03:40:42,130
But first he needs to reach cauldron lake and the cavern
where it all began.

3468
03:40:51,640 --> 03:40:52,120
Easy.

3469
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:54,460
Easy.

3470
03:40:55,180 --> 03:40:57,280
Look, I'm taking care of my vehicle.

3471
03:40:58,460 --> 03:40:59,340
Is that just fire?

3472
03:40:59,800 --> 03:41:00,700
Is that on fire?

3473
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,000
Okay.

3474
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:06,060
So why am I going in here now and not to the lake?

3475
03:41:06,240 --> 03:41:06,460
Oops.

3476
03:41:06,780 --> 03:41:08,340
I said I was taking care of my things.

3477
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:09,800
I meant it.

3478
03:41:11,920 --> 03:41:13,400
I have another unread page.

3479
03:41:13,440 --> 03:41:13,680
I do.

3480
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:27,000
oh you're right Sarah Barry in the well-lit room in the end
Barry wasn't going to shoot Sarah they both knew that once

3481
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:32,800
she had no chance of catching up to wake Barry gave up the
gun and sat down on the floor shielding his face from the

3482
03:41:32,800 --> 03:41:39,620
merciless glare of the well-lit room I don't think I'm ever
gonna see him again he said in a weak voice Sarah didn't

3483
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:47,020
have it in her to be mad at him besides he was probably
right oh he saw That's our best friend!

3484
03:41:48,760 --> 03:41:50,360
That's our best friend!

3485
03:41:51,700 --> 03:41:53,240
Why am I not at the lake?

3486
03:41:53,520 --> 03:41:55,400
I have many questions.

3487
03:41:56,140 --> 03:41:59,240
Do I get the checkpoint even in... Okay, I guess not.

3488
03:42:02,700 --> 03:42:03,260
Very...

3489
03:42:04,460 --> 03:42:07,620
Okay, I did see all of this going on over here.

3490
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:14,770
This looks like an ambush, like for real.

3491
03:42:16,010 --> 03:42:17,590
This looks like I'm gonna... wait.

3492
03:42:23,330 --> 03:42:26,590
And wouldn't you know I called it?

3493
03:42:27,330 --> 03:42:28,230
Wouldn't you know?

3494
03:42:30,550 --> 03:42:31,910
Where'd the other guy go?

3495
03:42:33,770 --> 03:42:35,370
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

3496
03:42:35,770 --> 03:42:37,790
Why am I regressing?

3497
03:42:38,750 --> 03:42:43,010
Why are my fingers like abandoning me?

3498
03:42:51,790 --> 03:42:53,430
I just get it in my head.

3499
03:42:57,940 --> 03:42:58,360
Nice.

3500
03:42:58,860 --> 03:43:00,080
A lot of good stuff.

3501
03:43:05,370 --> 03:43:06,610
That's fine, though.

3502
03:43:08,730 --> 03:43:09,470
It's in my nature.

3503
03:43:09,590 --> 03:43:10,670
What does that suppose I mean?

3504
03:43:10,910 --> 03:43:13,370
It's in my nature to be a screw-up.

3505
03:43:17,030 --> 03:43:20,190
Can we, like...

3506
03:43:21,650 --> 03:43:22,470
Read.

3507
03:43:22,730 --> 03:43:23,070
What's that?

3508
03:43:23,130 --> 03:43:23,910
What do you mean, read?

3509
03:43:24,490 --> 03:43:25,110
What am I reading?

3510
03:43:25,630 --> 03:43:26,010
Oh, this?

3511
03:43:26,850 --> 03:43:28,670
All visitors must see the yard manager.

3512
03:43:28,850 --> 03:43:29,950
You must sign a liability.

3513
03:43:31,950 --> 03:43:33,310
shift hazardous area.

3514
03:43:34,250 --> 03:43:34,870
Okay, whatever.

3515
03:43:36,170 --> 03:43:36,230
Hmm.

3516
03:43:38,350 --> 03:43:39,830
Is there something to open that?

3517
03:43:47,090 --> 03:43:48,470
Leave me alone!

3518
03:43:49,570 --> 03:43:50,610
Oh, shoot!

3519
03:43:58,350 --> 03:43:59,350
There's the manager.

3520
03:44:00,010 --> 03:44:02,190
I would like to speak to a manager.

3521
03:44:09,580 --> 03:44:10,260
More ammo.

3522
03:44:11,960 --> 03:44:12,360
Yippee!

3523
03:44:16,060 --> 03:44:20,560
I thought that there would be something to Open the gate.

3524
03:44:20,720 --> 03:44:27,620
I guess I could try the gate to see if I, you know, need to
open it or not.

3525
03:44:28,240 --> 03:44:30,000
But it's fine getting supplies too, it's good.

3526
03:44:35,770 --> 03:44:36,630
There is.

3527
03:44:43,500 --> 03:44:44,380
Very nice.

3528
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:46,720
Very nice.

3529
03:44:48,040 --> 03:44:50,400
Why does it feel like we've been here before?

3530
03:44:51,080 --> 03:44:55,040
Or at least an area that looked very similar to this area.

3531
03:44:56,320 --> 03:44:56,840
Okay.

3532
03:44:56,860 --> 03:45:01,040
This is like the same exact building layout, and then there
was like a boss down here.

3533
03:45:01,160 --> 03:45:01,860
I remember that.

3534
03:45:03,740 --> 03:45:05,280
They reuse assets a lot.

3535
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:06,380
It seems like it.

3536
03:45:13,580 --> 03:45:14,340
Oh my god.

3537
03:45:22,580 --> 03:45:23,040
I leave.

3538
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:27,040
I hear him running.

3539
03:45:31,440 --> 03:45:31,720
Anyway.

3540
03:45:34,720 --> 03:45:36,360
Planned my escape route perfectly.

3541
03:45:38,980 --> 03:45:39,540
Please.

3542
03:45:39,700 --> 03:45:40,840
I just want to get to the lake.

3543
03:45:42,540 --> 03:45:43,980
I really just want to get to the lake.

3544
03:45:47,820 --> 03:45:48,180
Wow!

3545
03:45:49,640 --> 03:45:50,000
Okay.

3546
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:52,360
Wow.

3547
03:45:52,820 --> 03:45:53,840
That looks not so good.

3548
03:45:59,920 --> 03:46:01,220
Where are we supposed to go from here?

3549
03:46:01,400 --> 03:46:01,840
Over here?

3550
03:46:06,150 --> 03:46:06,490
Maybe?

3551
03:46:10,460 --> 03:46:11,660
Oh, it's like swinging.

3552
03:46:12,480 --> 03:46:12,820
Whoa!

3553
03:46:15,740 --> 03:46:16,100
Um...

3554
03:46:17,840 --> 03:46:19,740
Am I supposed to do this?

3555
03:46:20,860 --> 03:46:21,480
Minto of the lake.

3556
03:46:21,700 --> 03:46:22,540
What is your wisdom?

3557
03:46:25,020 --> 03:46:26,060
Oh, there's a page here.

3558
03:46:27,380 --> 03:46:27,920
And some flares.

3559
03:46:28,500 --> 03:46:30,760
My wisdom is...

3560
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:32,580
Go with friends.

3561
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:36,840
You don't have to do it alone.

3562
03:46:39,340 --> 03:46:41,700
Game is charming, but it's very padded with combat.

3563
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:44,100
And they put too many enemies behind you.

3564
03:46:44,220 --> 03:46:45,700
I enjoyed Alan Wake 2 a lot more.

3565
03:46:45,820 --> 03:46:46,440
Hope you will, too.

3566
03:46:46,940 --> 03:46:47,500
I'm glad.

3567
03:46:47,840 --> 03:46:56,420
glad that because I guess that would be my quote-unquote
criticism about this game and if two is less like that then

3568
03:46:56,420 --> 03:47:05,000
that's good Thomas Zane's last drive Zane cut its heart out
but it didn't die the thing that wore Barbara's face kept

3569
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:11,760
crooning sweet nothings demolition derbing me though he put
on the suit untied the monster from the chair the thing in

3570
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:19,960
his arms thrashed weakly but he held fast he stepped outside
off the pier and into the dark water a sinking pinprick of

3571
03:47:19,960 --> 03:47:28,020
light descending toward a bottom that never came she has a
lot of variety oh i'm really glad that's my only thing about

3572
03:47:28,020 --> 03:47:38,600
this game is like it feels pretty repetitive it's like i get
to an area uh i get ambushed i get to an area i get ambushed

3573
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:39,700
you know

3574
03:47:43,640 --> 03:47:45,860
okay i'm about to be ambushed

3575
03:47:49,600 --> 03:47:52,020
What is this anyway?

3576
03:48:02,660 --> 03:48:03,540
Okay.

3577
03:48:21,340 --> 03:48:22,220
Got

3578
03:48:28,290 --> 03:48:33,010
me driving over the five feet to this thing.

3579
03:48:36,270 --> 03:48:36,390
No!

3580
03:48:36,890 --> 03:48:37,210
No!

3581
03:48:38,570 --> 03:48:38,730
No!

3582
03:48:39,190 --> 03:48:39,470
Oh

3583
03:48:56,480 --> 03:48:58,220
my god, it's hefty.

3584
03:49:02,700 --> 03:49:03,760
That's right.

3585
03:49:07,020 --> 03:49:07,880
Are there still guys?

3586
03:49:10,200 --> 03:49:11,720
I don't know, I can't tell.

3587
03:49:15,620 --> 03:49:16,140
My car!

3588
03:49:17,860 --> 03:49:19,020
My car!

3589
03:49:20,740 --> 03:49:21,800
My car!

3590
03:49:22,420 --> 03:49:23,900
We lost a Vitra rock.

3591
03:49:24,500 --> 03:49:25,800
Wait, where am I?

3592
03:49:25,980 --> 03:49:27,220
What is opening up anyway?

3593
03:49:28,160 --> 03:49:29,860
Like I lost it, whatever it was.

3594
03:49:33,480 --> 03:49:34,500
That's just sparks.

3595
03:49:40,720 --> 03:49:42,620
Yeah, I don't know where I need to go.

3596
03:49:43,260 --> 03:49:44,420
Oh, this opened up, just kidding.

3597
03:49:44,620 --> 03:49:45,640
I do know where I need to go.

3598
03:49:47,600 --> 03:49:51,420
Run in, run in, run in, run in, run in, run in, run in, run
in, run in.

3599
03:49:52,560 --> 03:49:53,480
A new car!

3600
03:49:57,720 --> 03:49:59,120
Game is like, here you are, buddy.

3601
03:49:59,780 --> 03:50:01,460
We know you destroyed your last one.

3602
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:07,160
All right, on the road.

3603
03:50:09,380 --> 03:50:17,180
I just don't understand, I guess, Alan's logic being like,
oh, I have to go through this place to...

3604
03:50:19,460 --> 03:50:19,960
Whoa.

3605
03:50:22,200 --> 03:50:24,060
Did we go through there?

3606
03:50:25,320 --> 03:50:25,720
Wait.

3607
03:50:28,620 --> 03:50:30,960
What if we could get the car over there?

3608
03:50:31,340 --> 03:50:33,340
I think I also saw a manuscript page.

3609
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:39,360
well i know the road is blocked but it still just seems so
silly

3610
03:50:42,500 --> 03:50:47,880
but also the layout of this town is actual hell what if i
need to get to a hospital

3611
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,700
like i think everybody might die

3612
03:50:56,870 --> 03:51:06,350
can i grab the no okay i think i heard whispers Nope, I
think it's just ambiance.

3613
03:51:06,510 --> 03:51:07,090
Just kidding.

3614
03:51:10,650 --> 03:51:12,030
No, I think I heard a cat.

3615
03:51:12,750 --> 03:51:13,630
What am I hearing?

3616
03:51:15,330 --> 03:51:17,930
Oh, there's like so many blinky light things in here.

3617
03:51:18,630 --> 03:51:19,470
What's going on?

3618
03:51:19,510 --> 03:51:24,490
When I told Barry my plan back in the well-lit room, I'd
acted as if I knew what I was doing.

3619
03:51:25,450 --> 03:51:26,030
I didn't.

3620
03:51:26,390 --> 03:51:28,950
I was operating on the shifting logic of a dream.

3621
03:51:29,310 --> 03:51:29,690
Follow!

3622
03:51:29,910 --> 03:51:32,390
I had to fight my way to the lake through the horrors of the
night.

3623
03:51:34,810 --> 03:51:41,850
imbued with childhood magic i had to write a happy ending to
a horror story i had to save my wife from the dark prison

3624
03:51:41,850 --> 03:52:02,310
she was being held in follow okay why why oh wait what did i
miss revolver ammo where am i supposed to go from here i

3625
03:52:02,310 --> 03:52:14,370

town is wait hello am I trapped in here how do I get out do

3626
03:52:14,370 --> 03:52:32,600

go I can't see it all oh push yes introduce a new mechanic

3627
03:52:32,600 --> 03:52:44,910
at the last chapter of the game Alan push it's a new
mechanic but it's literally just pushing a thing

3628
03:52:48,340 --> 03:52:53,780
I think this happened once before okay okay

3629
03:52:57,660 --> 03:53:06,070
some weapons yeah I was seeing all of these great love it

3630
03:53:09,220 --> 03:53:10,260
Love it.

3631
03:53:13,340 --> 03:53:17,320
What am I- oh no, we're using a hunting rifle.

3632
03:53:17,500 --> 03:53:20,040
I'll still stick with that I think even.

3633
03:53:25,230 --> 03:53:26,810
Okay, here they come.

3634
03:53:31,230 --> 03:53:35,350
I see so many blinky things in the- I will never give her to
you.

3635
03:53:35,730 --> 03:53:36,370
Oh my god.

3636
03:53:36,830 --> 03:53:37,170
Oh!

3637
03:53:41,750 --> 03:53:42,910
Oh Ooh

3638
03:53:47,040 --> 03:53:49,190
Oh wait, what happened to me?

3639
03:53:50,790 --> 03:53:51,490
What is going on?

3640
03:53:52,370 --> 03:53:53,390
What is going on?

3641
03:53:57,320 --> 03:54:06,760
I don't know if there's other guys, just in case Oh I think
I need to do this again

3642
03:54:12,130 --> 03:54:16,590
Oh shoot You asshole!

3643
03:54:17,170 --> 03:54:17,230
You asshole!

3644
03:54:17,250 --> 03:54:18,510
Please!

3645
03:54:26,170 --> 03:54:27,070
Oh my god.

3646
03:54:28,010 --> 03:54:29,310
Oh my god, this is so unfair.

3647
03:54:31,070 --> 03:54:31,830
This is so unfair.

3648
03:54:34,330 --> 03:54:35,790
Oh, come on!

3649
03:54:42,910 --> 03:54:44,310
If I couldn't use it!

3650
03:54:45,650 --> 03:54:46,310
What?

3651
03:54:46,850 --> 03:54:54,390
Why would you give me the spotlight if you're gonna have a
guy spawn right next to me?

3652
03:54:57,370 --> 03:54:59,690
That was so rude!

3653
03:55:05,050 --> 03:55:07,850
Yeah, and now I know not to go next to it.

3654
03:55:07,970 --> 03:55:10,170
And then I got like blown into a...

3655
03:55:10,170 --> 03:55:13,650
Okay, we'll use the flashbangs for sure.

3656
03:55:16,530 --> 03:55:18,910
That was craziness!

3657
03:55:21,670 --> 03:55:22,310
Game.

3658
03:55:23,090 --> 03:55:23,730
Game.

3659
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:28,480
Wait, please.

3660
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:29,800
Pick up the flashbang.

3661
03:55:30,060 --> 03:55:30,840
Thank you.

3662
03:55:32,940 --> 03:55:33,380
Alright.

3663
03:55:34,920 --> 03:55:35,940
Can't trust this game.

3664
03:55:36,080 --> 03:55:36,780
I don't!

3665
03:55:37,240 --> 03:55:38,720
Why would they do that?

3666
03:55:39,600 --> 03:55:41,860
I will never give her to you.

3667
03:55:42,960 --> 03:55:44,060
It's so loud.

3668
03:55:45,400 --> 03:55:47,040
Don't just... don't focus.

3669
03:55:47,180 --> 03:55:47,580
Just run.

3670
03:55:48,120 --> 03:55:48,620
We're running.

3671
03:55:48,740 --> 03:55:48,980
We're running.

3672
03:55:49,140 --> 03:55:49,380
We're running.

3673
03:56:03,700 --> 03:56:04,060
Please.

3674
03:56:04,400 --> 03:56:04,680
Hit.

3675
03:56:06,860 --> 03:56:08,380
Oh, I don't think it hit enough.

3676
03:56:11,680 --> 03:56:15,380
hit oh i don't oh what the hell was that noise

3677
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:33,840
i don't care if i'm wasting these honestly i don't care

3678
03:56:44,970 --> 03:57:00,460
what does that mean oh okay more oh my god they're so
stinking tanky i'm just throwing another one I don't care oh

3679
03:57:00,460 --> 03:57:06,400
my god these

3680
03:57:12,470 --> 03:57:24,430

asshole come over here and fight me it's like it's like a

3682
03:57:40,440 --> 03:57:48,220
farting sound zooming past me i guess i could have like
lowered this because previously when i was attempting to use

3683
03:57:48,220 --> 03:57:59,060
it um i was able to lower it and like weaken them but it was
just easier throwing all the nades i'm not gonna lie like

3684
03:57:59,060 --> 03:58:06,740
the flash bags were so much easier what was that So rude.

3685
03:58:08,940 --> 03:58:10,500
So stinking rude.

3686
03:58:11,660 --> 03:58:12,340
Come on.

3687
03:58:12,700 --> 03:58:13,040
Alan jump.

3688
03:58:13,580 --> 03:58:14,060
Alan push.

3689
03:58:14,340 --> 03:58:15,380
Oh my god.

3690
03:58:15,620 --> 03:58:17,500
You have to B to push and then just spam A.

3691
03:58:20,600 --> 03:58:22,920
I need to reload my gun.

3692
03:58:33,000 --> 03:58:35,620
Suddenly they're like, hey, don't you want to push all this
stuff?

3693
03:58:42,420 --> 03:58:42,980
Uh...

3694
03:58:42,980 --> 03:58:44,980
Oh cool, then we're just missing one more.

3695
03:58:45,020 --> 03:58:48,860
The dumb place I found myself in was unlike anything I could
ever have imagined.

3696
03:58:49,520 --> 03:58:50,220
It wasn't solid.

3697
03:58:51,380 --> 03:58:53,080
It was conceptual and subjective.

3698
03:58:53,340 --> 03:58:53,900
Solidus.

3699
03:58:53,900 --> 03:58:56,280
For someone else, an artist in another field.

3700
03:58:56,700 --> 03:58:57,960
It would have been very different.

3701
03:58:58,560 --> 03:59:01,120
I could sense the story of the manuscript all around me.

3702
03:59:01,480 --> 03:59:04,820
The words and ideas floating in the air, poised to become
real.

3703
03:59:06,140 --> 03:59:06,360
Liquid.

3704
03:59:06,800 --> 03:59:07,800
No, solidus.

3705
03:59:08,300 --> 03:59:09,780
Neither solid nor liquid.

3706
03:59:10,920 --> 03:59:12,620
A space in between.

3707
03:59:14,500 --> 03:59:15,040
B to push.

3708
03:59:15,640 --> 03:59:16,200
Spam A.

3709
03:59:26,060 --> 03:59:27,100
Which way do I go?

3710
03:59:27,380 --> 03:59:28,460
Oh, probably towards the lion.

3711
03:59:30,920 --> 03:59:34,520
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

3712
03:59:48,960 --> 03:59:49,960
And guys...

3713
03:59:52,200 --> 03:59:54,220
If I leave the light...

3714
03:59:55,200 --> 03:59:56,760
I guess they like totally despawn.

3715
03:59:57,000 --> 03:59:57,240
That's nice.

3716
03:59:57,420 --> 03:59:57,920
Andragos!

3717
03:59:58,080 --> 03:59:59,260
Thank you so much, I thought I'd get that.

3718
03:59:59,600 --> 03:59:59,980
Thank you!

3719
04:00:00,820 --> 04:00:02,900
I could see Mirror Peak in the distance.

3720
04:00:03,420 --> 04:00:04,960
That's where Calderon Lake was.

3721
04:00:06,300 --> 04:00:07,420
Wait, the... the...

3722
04:00:08,160 --> 04:00:09,540
Which... the tall mountain?

3723
04:00:11,100 --> 04:00:11,600
Or...

3724
04:00:12,160 --> 04:00:13,240
Oh my god.

3725
04:00:22,680 --> 04:00:23,720
What were you looking at?

3726
04:00:25,760 --> 04:00:27,520
What were you looking at?

3727
04:00:35,110 --> 04:00:36,950
Do I go down here?

3728
04:00:37,070 --> 04:00:37,750
Oh yes, I do.

3729
04:00:38,310 --> 04:00:39,990
Wait, do I get to ride this?

3730
04:00:42,150 --> 04:00:43,630
Now let's jump!

3731
04:00:45,770 --> 04:00:46,930
Wait, what just happened?

3732
04:00:49,530 --> 04:00:51,190
Okay, hold on.

3733
04:00:52,510 --> 04:00:53,070
Yes!

3734
04:00:53,870 --> 04:00:54,430
Yes!

3735
04:00:58,410 --> 04:01:00,370
This is fine.

3736
04:01:01,390 --> 04:01:02,050
And very slow.

3737
04:01:05,780 --> 04:01:07,200
It's so peaceful.

3738
04:01:12,540 --> 04:01:13,340
I see the birds.

3739
04:01:21,980 --> 04:01:22,860
Kind of hard, though.

3740
04:01:25,950 --> 04:01:26,750
Oh,

3741
04:01:35,610 --> 04:01:35,970
my god.

3742
04:01:37,430 --> 04:01:38,710
We barely made it.

3743
04:01:44,050 --> 04:01:49,550
I'm kind of like, is this chapter mostly going to be getting
to the lake?

3744
04:01:52,590 --> 04:01:57,810
If only we had a helicopter or some friends, some nice
company.

3745
04:01:59,370 --> 04:02:00,510
We made it!

3746
04:02:02,650 --> 04:02:04,650
It is entirely getting to the lake.

3747
04:02:04,790 --> 04:02:05,730
Don't tell me that.

3748
04:02:06,510 --> 04:02:07,230
No way.

3749
04:02:08,550 --> 04:02:09,110
Entirely?

3750
04:02:14,240 --> 04:02:18,280
Oh my gosh, am I going to be pushing this thing and then
also trying to fight off the birds?

3751
04:02:20,380 --> 04:02:21,900
I hate when I'm right.

3752
04:02:25,380 --> 04:02:30,240
You know, the gift of prophecy, at least, oh, maybe we're
fine.

3753
04:02:30,920 --> 04:02:36,760
They call it a gift, but it's quite often a curse.

3754
04:02:42,020 --> 04:02:42,720
Oh, no.

3755
04:02:51,940 --> 04:02:53,080
Alan jump

3756
04:03:02,470 --> 04:03:03,650
Where'd you go?

3757
04:03:11,790 --> 04:03:24,410
That was close I was hoping that maybe my battery would
charge enough before they flew back at me but no i don't

3758
04:03:24,410 --> 04:03:32,610
cinematic very allans don't belong in a lash oh

3759
04:03:37,610 --> 04:03:44,590
i love the music the music kills me it's so funny

3760
04:03:51,500 --> 04:03:59,860
i'd rather fight birds the entire time than the guys though
i'm not gonna lie give me birds all the way I'm the rest of

3761
04:03:59,860 --> 04:04:00,700
my way there.

3762
04:04:01,660 --> 04:04:03,040
Please, I don't want to fight anymore, man.

3763
04:04:03,380 --> 04:04:04,240
So tired.

3764
04:04:12,860 --> 04:04:14,760
Oh, oh, oh,

3765
04:04:22,100 --> 04:04:27,260
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh.

3766
04:04:27,260 --> 04:04:28,020
Yeah, stay away.

3767
04:04:28,660 --> 04:04:29,020
Where'd you go?

3768
04:04:29,540 --> 04:04:31,140
Wait, I said stay away, but come back.

3769
04:04:32,060 --> 04:04:37,100
Oh, I shall...

3770
04:04:37,100 --> 04:04:38,740
Get him in the legs, get him in the legs.

3771
04:04:38,860 --> 04:04:39,360
Oh shoot.

3772
04:04:44,380 --> 04:04:48,080
Where the hell?

3773
04:04:48,660 --> 04:04:49,420
Screw it.

3774
04:04:55,190 --> 04:04:55,490
Oh shoot.

3775
04:04:59,670 --> 04:05:00,870
Why is it in slow though?

3776
04:05:03,350 --> 04:05:04,310
Okay.

3777
04:05:07,590 --> 04:05:07,970
Sick.

3778
04:05:11,950 --> 04:05:12,910
Cinema.

3779
04:05:14,210 --> 04:05:14,890
Cinema.

3780
04:05:21,470 --> 04:05:22,510
Get ragdolled!

3781
04:05:27,540 --> 04:05:30,000
Oh, please have hunting rifle.

3782
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:31,920
No.

3783
04:05:32,580 --> 04:05:33,560
This revolver ammo.

3784
04:05:34,280 --> 04:05:36,020
I'll still take it.

3785
04:05:39,140 --> 04:05:41,240
I often forget about the flare gun.

3786
04:05:41,380 --> 04:05:42,040
I'm not gonna lie.

3787
04:05:42,760 --> 04:05:46,540
I'm sure you can tell, but it's great when I use it.

3788
04:05:48,460 --> 04:05:50,080
Okay, so we're going to the lift.

3789
04:05:51,100 --> 04:05:52,040
Anything else around?

3790
04:05:52,320 --> 04:05:55,720
I keep thinking I'm seeing sparkles, you know.

3791
04:05:59,920 --> 04:06:00,620
La la la.

3792
04:06:01,700 --> 04:06:02,600
La la la.

3793
04:06:03,980 --> 04:06:05,840
So much better in this game than in two.

3794
04:06:06,460 --> 04:06:08,120
I mean, I have a lot of ammo for it.

3795
04:06:08,200 --> 04:06:08,840
I should use it.

3796
04:06:10,820 --> 04:06:11,700
La la la.

3797
04:06:12,340 --> 04:06:13,500
To the lake.

3798
04:06:14,360 --> 04:06:15,480
To the lake.

3799
04:06:17,340 --> 04:06:18,440
Oh my god.

3800
04:06:18,460 --> 04:06:19,640
Oh!

3801
04:06:25,380 --> 04:06:25,520
Oh!

3802
04:06:29,930 --> 04:06:30,110
Oh!

3803
04:06:31,210 --> 04:06:31,450
Oh!

3804
04:06:32,490 --> 04:06:32,970
Yeah!

3805
04:06:48,520 --> 04:06:51,180
Why am I getting you through the tree?

3806
04:06:53,740 --> 04:06:54,360
I'm

3807
04:06:57,650 --> 04:06:58,830
hiding behind the tree!

3808
04:07:00,290 --> 04:07:06,440
Did I just go run?

3809
04:07:07,720 --> 04:07:08,940
He's hiding.

3810
04:07:10,300 --> 04:07:11,780
Scary cat, baby.

3811
04:07:20,720 --> 04:07:22,520
Can't wait to be ambushed here, too.

3812
04:07:24,280 --> 04:07:24,900
Oh my gosh.

3813
04:07:25,760 --> 04:07:26,060
Oh my gosh.

3814
04:07:26,640 --> 04:07:27,220
Holy shit.

3815
04:07:28,640 --> 04:07:28,940
Please.

3816
04:07:31,900 --> 04:07:32,480
Oh my god.

3817
04:07:32,640 --> 04:07:33,160
Oh my god.

3818
04:07:35,460 --> 04:07:36,460
Wait, no.

3819
04:07:42,080 --> 04:07:42,620
Okay.

3820
04:07:43,040 --> 04:07:43,440
Okay.

3821
04:07:44,120 --> 04:07:45,180
Now I can start this.

3822
04:07:46,020 --> 04:07:46,680
Jeez, Louise.

3823
04:07:52,480 --> 04:07:54,100
Yeah, I heard them coming too.

3824
04:07:54,540 --> 04:07:57,100
That's why I was like, I'm about to get ambushed by some
guys.

3825
04:07:58,260 --> 04:07:58,840
I know.

3826
04:07:59,000 --> 04:07:59,420
I know.

3827
04:08:00,240 --> 04:08:01,640
I know this game now.

3828
04:08:08,960 --> 04:08:09,700
This way?

3829
04:08:10,620 --> 04:08:11,540
What's up here?

3830
04:08:11,960 --> 04:08:12,240
Nothing?

3831
04:08:12,420 --> 04:08:12,660
Okay.

3832
04:08:13,320 --> 04:08:18,420
You can see, like, the parts that were, like, you know how
it describes the inside of the lake as, like, having all

3833
04:08:18,420 --> 04:08:19,220
the...

3834
04:08:22,820 --> 04:08:23,260
Another!

3835
04:08:23,580 --> 04:08:24,320
Like, all this stuff.

3836
04:08:24,620 --> 04:08:25,320
Oh my god.

3837
04:08:30,220 --> 04:08:30,600
Come on.

3838
04:08:30,820 --> 04:08:31,300
Where are you?

3839
04:08:31,520 --> 04:08:31,920
Where'd you go?

3840
04:08:33,860 --> 04:08:34,320
Oh, oh.

3841
04:08:34,640 --> 04:08:35,440
No, I'm just kidding.

3842
04:08:41,320 --> 04:08:41,760
Yeah.

3843
04:08:45,460 --> 04:08:46,520
You saw the rock?

3844
04:08:48,820 --> 04:08:49,320
She's stuck?

3845
04:08:57,080 --> 04:08:57,640
He's...

3846
04:08:57,640 --> 04:08:58,400
Who's he doing?

3847
04:08:58,980 --> 04:08:59,540
Oh,

3848
04:09:10,460 --> 04:09:10,940
I missed.

3849
04:09:12,080 --> 04:09:12,440
I missed.

3850
04:09:12,620 --> 04:09:13,220
Oh my god.

3851
04:09:17,920 --> 04:09:21,240
Oh my god, that scared the heck out of me.

3852
04:09:27,700 --> 04:09:29,540
That scared me so much!

3853
04:09:35,710 --> 04:09:36,870
Oh my god!

3854
04:09:46,540 --> 04:09:47,020
Where'd he go?

3855
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:51,480
I see you.

3856
04:09:52,040 --> 04:09:52,600
Thermus.

3857
04:09:56,460 --> 04:09:57,680
Grab it.

3858
04:09:57,860 --> 04:09:58,500
Grab it?

3859
04:09:59,060 --> 04:10:00,020
Oh, there's a guy there.

3860
04:10:06,110 --> 04:10:07,650
I'm gonna run out of flares at this rate.

3861
04:10:08,030 --> 04:10:08,730
Oh man.

3862
04:10:09,710 --> 04:10:10,350
Ah!

3863
04:10:10,930 --> 04:10:12,210
There's so many of them!

3864
04:10:15,250 --> 04:10:16,130
Oh shoot.

3865
04:10:16,790 --> 04:10:17,430
Oh shoot!

3866
04:10:22,730 --> 04:10:23,210
Yeah!

3867
04:10:25,910 --> 04:10:27,430
Late epic shot.

3868
04:10:29,330 --> 04:10:30,950
Where is he anyway?

3869
04:10:32,110 --> 04:10:33,170
Where is he?

3870
04:10:36,650 --> 04:10:38,010
Where is he?

3871
04:10:38,130 --> 04:10:38,270
Oh!

3872
04:10:47,520 --> 04:10:49,320
There's more stuff in here.

3873
04:10:49,800 --> 04:10:50,700
Flashbangs!

3874
04:10:51,180 --> 04:10:51,960
Thank you.

3875
04:10:54,080 --> 04:10:55,040
Itadakimasu!

3876
04:10:58,500 --> 04:11:02,700
I feel like I'm actually like kind of running out of flares
though.

3877
04:11:02,940 --> 04:11:05,620
I know that game like usually gives you so many, but I'm
like...

3878
04:11:06,380 --> 04:11:07,340
Um, I don't know.

3879
04:11:08,320 --> 04:11:09,080
Kind of scared.

3880
04:11:09,860 --> 04:11:11,040
Am I going the right way?

3881
04:11:11,440 --> 04:11:13,620
Seems like it.

3882
04:11:17,040 --> 04:11:17,500
Ah!

3883
04:11:20,080 --> 04:11:20,880
Holy shit!

3884
04:11:21,560 --> 04:11:21,880
Whoa!

3885
04:11:26,120 --> 04:11:27,420
Oh my god!

3886
04:11:28,380 --> 04:11:28,760
Oh shoot.

3887
04:11:34,190 --> 04:11:36,330
That was so cool!

3888
04:11:43,340 --> 04:11:44,480
Please, don't...

3889
04:11:44,860 --> 04:11:45,260
Please.

3890
04:11:47,140 --> 04:11:47,660
Okay.

3891
04:11:49,540 --> 04:11:50,520
Holy cow!

3892
04:11:52,360 --> 04:11:53,120
Alright.

3893
04:11:56,220 --> 04:11:58,040
I thought I heard somebody.

3894
04:12:00,900 --> 04:12:03,840
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3895
04:12:04,760 --> 04:12:05,520
Alright.

3896
04:12:07,300 --> 04:12:08,700
Your Honor, she's gaming.

3897
04:12:11,120 --> 04:12:12,960
I didn't even do anything.

3898
04:12:13,940 --> 04:12:14,540
I think.

3899
04:12:19,600 --> 04:12:20,520
What was that?

3900
04:12:21,660 --> 04:12:21,800
Oh.

3901
04:12:26,160 --> 04:12:27,460
We just keep going.

3902
04:12:27,880 --> 04:12:29,320
Just what I was about to say.

3903
04:12:31,000 --> 04:12:31,780
Oh crap indeed!

3904
04:12:38,060 --> 04:12:39,760
Stop with the slow-mos, please!

3905
04:12:46,830 --> 04:12:48,270
Just stay on the edge.

3906
04:12:48,670 --> 04:12:49,270
I think I'm okay.

3907
04:12:52,050 --> 04:12:53,190
Oh my god.

3908
04:12:54,930 --> 04:12:55,650
Maybe I'm not okay.

3909
04:12:59,770 --> 04:13:00,770
It's a barrel.

3910
04:13:01,570 --> 04:13:01,870
Ouch!

3911
04:13:02,490 --> 04:13:03,470
Oh, what was that?

3912
04:13:04,410 --> 04:13:05,250
No, wait.

3913
04:13:05,690 --> 04:13:07,250
Oh, I think it's the goop.

3914
04:13:08,530 --> 04:13:08,930
It's whatever.

3915
04:13:09,350 --> 04:13:09,750
I run.

3916
04:13:10,470 --> 04:13:11,050
I do not see.

3917
04:13:11,170 --> 04:13:11,730
I do not care.

3918
04:13:14,470 --> 04:13:14,950
Haunted.

3919
04:13:15,350 --> 04:13:15,590
Yeah.

3920
04:13:18,690 --> 04:13:20,190
I'll clean up anyway.

3921
04:13:20,310 --> 04:13:21,310
Because I'm a good Samaritan.

3922
04:13:22,030 --> 04:13:23,550
No litter, no litter.

3923
04:13:24,090 --> 04:13:27,050
Even if it's a spooky, goopy haunted litter.

3924
04:13:30,410 --> 04:13:34,590
Oh, get to Cauldron Lake, they said.

3925
04:13:37,250 --> 04:13:42,590
This is like suggesting to go to Silent Hill for like
vacation.

3926
04:13:43,070 --> 04:13:43,750
Who would do that?

3927
04:13:46,410 --> 04:13:47,910
Where even are we?

3928
04:13:48,670 --> 04:13:50,550
Is this the historical site?

3929
04:13:50,730 --> 04:13:51,390
Like what?

3930
04:13:51,410 --> 04:13:52,410
What is this place?

3931
04:13:55,350 --> 04:13:56,150
What are you saying?

3932
04:13:56,630 --> 04:13:58,110
The darkness wears her face.

3933
04:13:58,330 --> 04:13:58,550
I know!

3934
04:13:58,730 --> 04:13:59,290
I get it!

3935
04:13:59,390 --> 04:14:00,010
My god!

3936
04:14:18,100 --> 04:14:20,400
I have so much shotgun ammo.

3937
04:14:25,780 --> 04:14:30,420
I feel like I should just use the shotgun for a bit now.

3938
04:14:35,080 --> 04:14:35,640
Hmm.

3939
04:14:38,760 --> 04:14:40,040
to my hunting rifle.

3940
04:14:44,600 --> 04:14:46,140
Was I out of rifle shells?

3941
04:14:46,260 --> 04:14:47,520
I thought I had like eight or something.

3942
04:14:48,740 --> 04:14:50,480
The darkness controls the dragon.

3943
04:14:51,700 --> 04:14:52,900
Alright, over here, right?

3944
04:14:54,140 --> 04:14:54,880
Okay, good.

3945
04:15:00,040 --> 04:15:01,240
I'm like just looking around.

3946
04:15:01,460 --> 04:15:05,700
I'm scoping the place out before we... Oh my gosh.

3947
04:15:05,840 --> 04:15:07,460
There's like buttons everywhere.

3948
04:15:07,540 --> 04:15:08,680
This place is huge.

3949
04:15:10,460 --> 04:15:11,220
Oh no!

3950
04:15:11,760 --> 04:15:19,500

the thing over and ride it oh man this is gonna wait how do

3952
04:15:35,980 --> 04:15:41,660

3953
04:15:46,230 --> 04:15:48,890
I'm trying to like plan my route before I go through.

3954
04:15:49,390 --> 04:15:51,310
Alan could just bend out.

3955
04:15:52,130 --> 04:15:54,510
Alan has the worst knees in histories.

3956
04:15:58,070 --> 04:15:58,970
You don't.

3957
04:16:00,430 --> 04:16:02,190
But am I not driving that?

3958
04:16:08,780 --> 04:16:11,480
Preemptive flare gun at the ready?

3959
04:16:19,860 --> 04:16:20,260
Huh.

3960
04:16:26,930 --> 04:16:27,650
I'm scared.

3961
04:16:29,570 --> 04:16:30,130
Oh my god.

3962
04:16:30,910 --> 04:16:31,690
Oh my god.

3963
04:16:32,110 --> 04:16:33,630
They give you so much stuff.

3964
04:16:52,840 --> 04:16:54,360
What is he doing?

3965
04:16:56,200 --> 04:16:57,040
Oh my god!

3966
04:17:05,370 --> 04:17:06,090
Oh my god.

3967
04:17:06,290 --> 04:17:06,730
I missed.

3968
04:17:07,250 --> 04:17:07,590
I missed.

3969
04:17:08,150 --> 04:17:08,470
Oh my god.

3970
04:17:08,670 --> 04:17:08,890
I missed.

3971
04:17:09,190 --> 04:17:09,730
Oh my god.

3972
04:17:16,360 --> 04:17:17,240
Come on.

3973
04:17:17,240 --> 04:17:18,360
Can you guys, like, stay close?

3974
04:17:24,060 --> 04:17:26,480
Oh shoot, uh, Flare?

3975
04:17:29,200 --> 04:17:31,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3976
04:17:32,340 --> 04:17:32,780
Okay.

3977
04:17:33,420 --> 04:17:35,220
I wish I could see anything right now.

3978
04:17:40,370 --> 04:17:41,170
Where are you?

3979
04:17:41,910 --> 04:17:42,550
Oh my god!

3980
04:17:43,370 --> 04:17:43,870
Oh my god.

3981
04:17:44,330 --> 04:17:45,430
That was so stinking close.

3982
04:17:47,550 --> 04:17:49,290
Uh, he's like, camping me?

3983
04:17:58,420 --> 04:18:00,240
I wish I had my hunting rifle right now.

3984
04:18:02,780 --> 04:18:04,840
I wish I had my hunting rifle right now.

3985
04:18:06,240 --> 04:18:08,080
I wish I had my hunting rifle right now.

3986
04:18:13,900 --> 04:18:15,300
Okay, I think I took care of them for now.

3987
04:18:24,120 --> 04:18:30,260
Honestly, with those guys running around, it's easier to
just, like, kind of wait for them.

3988
04:18:31,040 --> 04:18:31,680
I hear somebody.

3989
04:18:54,440 --> 04:18:54,880
Wee!

3990
04:18:55,060 --> 04:18:56,760
Why is everything in this game so slow?

3991
04:18:59,500 --> 04:19:01,520
Oh, okay.

3992
04:19:04,780 --> 04:19:06,360
I don't even feel like looking around.

3993
04:19:07,080 --> 04:19:08,020
Just give me to the like.

3994
04:19:13,500 --> 04:19:15,340
Oh, I think that's our last page!

3995
04:19:16,140 --> 04:19:16,500
Awesome!

3996
04:19:20,020 --> 04:19:22,300
Oh, I was worried that I might miss it.

3997
04:19:24,820 --> 04:19:25,180
Nice.

3998
04:19:28,740 --> 04:19:29,180
Yes!

3999
04:19:29,840 --> 04:19:30,040
Right?

4000
04:19:30,360 --> 04:19:31,580
If it doesn't scroll down, yeah.

4001
04:19:32,300 --> 04:19:36,480
After Zane had gone, I stood alone in the shifting dream
that was the dark place.

4002
04:19:37,060 --> 04:19:38,500
I had to find a way to the cabin.

4003
04:19:39,180 --> 04:19:41,660
I had written myself a way through this place in the
manuscript.

4004
04:19:42,380 --> 04:19:44,060
I followed the idea of a path.

4005
04:19:44,740 --> 04:19:50,460
I had written myself across the ocean that blocked my way,
and with that, there was a bridge to the island beyond.

4006
04:19:51,180 --> 04:19:53,920
The idea of the cabin flickered in the underwater darkness.

4007
04:19:54,360 --> 04:19:57,080
I willed the cabin to be real, and it was.

4008
04:19:57,960 --> 04:20:00,040
The idea of a path.

4009
04:20:03,820 --> 04:20:08,360
I'm getting like Looney Tunes vibes where you know like...

4010
04:20:08,360 --> 04:20:09,880
Where like...

4011
04:20:09,880 --> 04:20:12,300
Wildy Coyote will paint a road...

4012
04:20:12,500 --> 04:20:14,780
Like a... Like a road on the wall.

4013
04:20:15,120 --> 04:20:17,240
And Roadrunner will run down it.

4014
04:20:17,340 --> 04:20:18,800
And it's just...

4015
04:20:22,780 --> 04:20:23,500
Okay.

4016
04:20:24,120 --> 04:20:24,520
Nice.

4017
04:20:24,760 --> 04:20:25,720
We just gotta think.

4018
04:20:26,700 --> 04:20:28,020
And it will happen.

4019
04:20:28,640 --> 04:20:29,420
I guess.

4020
04:20:29,640 --> 04:20:30,360
Oh.

4021
04:20:30,380 --> 04:20:32,400
Oh, thank goodness.

4022
04:20:34,440 --> 04:20:35,400
All right.

4023
04:20:36,760 --> 04:20:38,000
Are we almost there?

4024
04:20:44,800 --> 04:20:46,700
Turn back now.

4025
04:20:47,340 --> 04:20:51,780
Oh, oh, it's a magnet.

4026
04:21:00,020 --> 04:21:00,340
Oh shoot.

4027
04:21:00,700 --> 04:21:01,080
Oh my god.

4028
04:21:01,420 --> 04:21:02,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4029
04:21:04,340 --> 04:21:04,980
Please.

4030
04:21:05,960 --> 04:21:06,520
There we go.

4031
04:21:10,690 --> 04:21:11,810
Oh, awkward.

4032
04:21:18,300 --> 04:21:18,820
Oh, oh, shoot.

4033
04:21:19,200 --> 04:21:20,320
I have the wrong weapon.

4034
04:21:21,320 --> 04:21:22,680
Holy cow.

4035
04:21:33,200 --> 04:21:34,640
Why are you so strong now?

4036
04:21:35,180 --> 04:21:37,580
Shouldn't my shotgun, like, do more than just that?

4037
04:21:39,200 --> 04:21:39,680
Allen dodge.

4038
04:21:39,980 --> 04:21:40,580
Allen dodge.

4039
04:21:41,380 --> 04:21:42,640
Okay, we got rid of that.

4040
04:21:44,660 --> 04:21:45,840
Um, what if I do this?

4041
04:21:47,760 --> 04:21:48,280
Hey, yeah.

4042
04:21:52,380 --> 04:21:52,940
Did

4043
04:22:00,450 --> 04:22:01,010
that?

4044
04:22:01,030 --> 04:22:01,570
that do anything?

4045
04:22:07,080 --> 04:22:08,300
You were spoiled by the rifle.

4046
04:22:08,540 --> 04:22:09,440
I truly was.

4047
04:22:16,570 --> 04:22:18,110
I think I hear somebody.

4048
04:22:18,610 --> 04:22:18,670
What?

4049
04:22:24,440 --> 04:22:26,080
Stop it!

4050
04:22:28,160 --> 04:22:29,460
Go away!

4051
04:22:33,120 --> 04:22:34,160
Nice spot.

4052
04:22:34,920 --> 04:22:35,860
What if we hit flare gun?

4053
04:22:37,260 --> 04:22:37,760
Oh.

4054
04:22:44,760 --> 04:22:46,140
Oh, just kidding.

4055
04:22:55,080 --> 04:22:57,660
Oh my god, wait, there's rocks.

4056
04:22:58,020 --> 04:22:59,500
Oh my god, what am I supposed to do about the rocks?

4057
04:23:13,070 --> 04:23:14,850
Why this game's so flashy.

4058
04:23:16,150 --> 04:23:16,710
Oh my goodness.

4059
04:23:18,170 --> 04:23:19,070
Wait, is this my thumbnail?

4060
04:23:19,710 --> 04:23:20,630
Oh my god.

4061
04:23:23,270 --> 04:23:24,530
Why would you say that?

4062
04:23:26,890 --> 04:23:28,910
What does that have to do with anything?

4063
04:23:30,850 --> 04:23:33,030
I think she liked me very much, maybe.

4064
04:23:36,530 --> 04:23:37,730
Am I getting it from here?

4065
04:23:39,530 --> 04:23:40,070
Oh, wait!

4066
04:23:41,190 --> 04:23:42,210
Oh, my God!

4067
04:23:42,430 --> 04:23:43,210
Holy cow!

4068
04:23:43,390 --> 04:23:44,650
That was so close!

4069
04:23:51,750 --> 04:23:53,990
Alan, dodge, but do it better.

4070
04:23:54,470 --> 04:23:54,750
Dodge!

4071
04:24:02,530 --> 04:24:03,210
Oh, wait.

4072
04:24:08,910 --> 04:24:10,490
Is that a thermos?

4073
04:24:11,150 --> 04:24:11,150
No.

4074
04:24:13,770 --> 04:24:15,850
Just will the house into existence!

4075
04:24:16,870 --> 04:24:17,770
You can do it!

4076
04:24:17,950 --> 04:24:18,470
Checkpoint!

4077
04:24:18,910 --> 04:24:19,170
Nice.

4078
04:24:21,530 --> 04:24:22,150
Oh, ouch.

4079
04:24:22,350 --> 04:24:22,950
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4080
04:24:24,670 --> 04:24:25,630
Can't see anything.

4081
04:24:31,860 --> 04:24:32,360
I'm going!

4082
04:24:32,460 --> 04:24:32,560
Oh!

4083
04:24:33,020 --> 04:24:33,280
Oh!

4084
04:24:33,760 --> 04:24:34,260
By bad.

4085
04:24:35,080 --> 04:24:35,340
I

4086
04:24:39,880 --> 04:24:42,060
didn't know that there was a...

4087
04:24:47,760 --> 04:24:49,100
Destroy the tornado!

4088
04:24:50,340 --> 04:24:50,860
Oh.

4089
04:25:00,280 --> 04:25:00,800
Wee!

4090

4098
04:25:11,840 --> 04:25:12,100
Shoot!

4099
04:25:13,540 --> 04:25:14,900
Oh, okay, that didn't do much.

4100
04:25:15,620 --> 04:25:23,550
Uh, how else do you want me to do this?

4101
04:25:23,930 --> 04:25:26,750

4105
04:26:00,200 --> 04:26:01,400
See that at the end of it?

4106
04:26:01,960 --> 04:26:02,840
You want these parts too?

4107
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:03,920
Okay.

4108
04:26:04,980 --> 04:26:05,940
Ammo box?

4109
04:26:06,120 --> 04:26:06,260
Where?

4110
04:26:08,700 --> 04:26:09,140
Woo!

4111
04:26:09,940 --> 04:26:11,040

4112
04:26:12,080 --> 04:26:13,060
Um, okay.

4113
04:26:14,080 --> 04:26:14,940
Follow the boat.

4114
04:26:16,480 --> 04:26:17,660
Oh my goodness.

4115
04:26:17,660 --> 04:26:19,080
Oh my gosh, stop doing that please!

4116
04:26:24,700 --> 04:26:25,440
Uh...

4117
04:26:25,440 --> 04:26:26,320
Uh...

4118
04:26:26,320 --> 04:26:26,700
Uh...

4119
04:26:27,360 --> 04:26:28,440
There we go.

4120
04:26:32,700 --> 04:26:34,780
I had to get light into it's hard to hurt it.

4121
04:26:35,720 --> 04:26:38,180
Bill is hard with light.

4122
04:26:39,340 --> 04:26:40,400
Oh, my gosh.

4123
04:26:40,520 --> 04:26:41,820
I feel like I almost about to fall.

4124
04:26:42,360 --> 04:26:42,900
Holy cow.

4125
04:26:45,300 --> 04:26:46,600
Not that one.

4126
04:26:47,640 --> 04:26:48,240
There we go.

4127
04:26:52,310 --> 04:26:52,410
Oh.

4128
04:26:56,320 --> 04:26:57,660
Jump into it.

4129
04:26:58,600 --> 04:26:59,720
I don't think so.

4130
04:26:59,940 --> 04:27:00,180
Maybe?

4131
04:27:00,400 --> 04:27:01,040
I don't know, actually.

4132
04:27:04,900 --> 04:27:05,300
Alan.

4133
04:27:06,020 --> 04:27:06,100
Alan.

4134
04:27:06,120 --> 04:27:06,980
Do

4135
04:27:11,420 --> 04:27:12,960
not jump into it.

4136
04:27:13,100 --> 04:27:13,560
Are you sure?

4137
04:27:15,820 --> 04:27:16,300
Because...

4138
04:27:17,380 --> 04:27:19,980
I feel like it's just that one piece that I can't get.

4139
04:27:23,320 --> 04:27:25,280
Oh my gosh, it's moving so fast.

4140
04:27:29,090 --> 04:27:30,670
Oh, that one.

4141
04:27:33,020 --> 04:27:34,560
There's an ammo box?

4142
04:27:34,640 --> 04:27:35,200
Is there really?

4143
04:27:37,580 --> 04:27:38,120
I don't...

4144
04:27:38,120 --> 04:27:38,320
Oh!

4145
04:27:40,520 --> 04:27:41,820
Can I jump that way?

4146
04:27:41,900 --> 04:27:42,640
I don't think I can.

4147
04:27:45,320 --> 04:27:47,680
Oh, I can, I can.

4148
04:27:47,820 --> 04:27:51,000
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4149
04:28:00,710 --> 04:28:02,530
Okay, okay, okay.

4150
04:28:04,450 --> 04:28:05,010
Uh...

4151
04:28:05,010 --> 04:28:05,590
Oh, shoot.

4152
04:28:08,550 --> 04:28:09,110
Maybe...

4153
04:28:09,110 --> 04:28:09,450
Like, hit.

4154
04:28:11,150 --> 04:28:11,570
Ah!

4155
04:28:34,590 --> 04:28:35,670
Times it, like, targets on.

4156
04:28:47,170 --> 04:28:48,530
I don't think I got him.

4157
04:28:50,650 --> 04:28:52,570

It did say the heart.

4160
04:28:57,130 --> 04:29:01,930
Maybe I got all that I can shoot at around it.

4161
04:29:02,290 --> 04:29:02,810
Let's see.

4162
04:29:02,850 --> 04:29:06,170
The flare gun was the only way to get right into the heart
of the gun.

4163
04:29:06,390 --> 04:29:07,970
Oh, yeah, baby!

4207
04:32:00,720 --> 04:32:02,220
He stands in your way.

4208
04:32:02,640 --> 04:32:03,960

Big Zane.

4211
04:32:09,220 --> 04:32:10,900
He's filled with darkness.

4212
04:32:12,060 --> 04:32:13,940
You must fill his heart with light.

4213
04:32:14,020 --> 04:32:15,560
I'll fill his heart with light!

4214
04:32:20,020 --> 04:32:20,440

Don't mind him.

4217
04:32:26,380 --> 04:32:27,220
He's Mr. Scott.

4218
04:32:28,600 --> 04:32:30,840
Your friends will meet him when you're gone.

4219
04:32:31,340 --> 04:32:32,160
Don't mind him?

4220
04:32:32,360 --> 04:32:33,740

4221
04:32:36,340 --> 04:32:37,880

4222
04:32:46,430 --> 04:32:47,810

4223
04:32:48,190 --> 04:32:49,270
The evil clone of you?

4224
04:32:49,890 --> 04:32:50,250
Yeah.

4225
04:32:51,650 --> 04:32:52,170
Whoa!

4226
04:32:53,710 --> 04:32:54,830
What is happening?

4227
04:32:55,230 --> 04:32:56,350
Oh, okay, now I can move.

4228
04:32:58,650 --> 04:33:00,090
Get rid- oh, I hate text!

04:33:17,450 --> 04:33:18,550
Wait, this is so fun!

4233
04:33:20,630 --> 04:33:20,910
Hello!

4234
04:33:23,590 --> 04:33:25,230
I followed the idea of a path.

4235
04:33:26,930 --> 04:33:27,690
A path!

4236
04:33:28,810 --> 04:33:30,410
What's in the shopping cart?

4237
04:33:37,020 --> 04:33:38,060
Domestic Allen.

4238
04:33:38,440 --> 04:33:39,020
What's this one?

4239
04:33:40,540 --> 04:33:41,640
What does that say?

4240
04:33:42,680 --> 04:33:43,380
Lighting pole?

4241
04:33:43,760 --> 04:33:44,060
Talking?

4242
04:33:44,440 --> 04:33:44,800
What is this?

4243
04:33:45,160 --> 04:33:46,140
Some sort of pole?

4244
04:33:47,420 --> 04:33:48,300
Oh, okay.

4245
04:33:49,380 --> 04:33:51,280
I followed the idea of a path.

4246
04:33:55,820 --> 04:33:57,180
It's revealed to me!

4247
04:33:57,320 --> 04:33:57,520
Oh.

4248
04:33:59,280 --> 04:34:00,400

4253
04:34:11,760 --> 04:34:12,800
I'm leaving you, Alan.

4254
04:34:13,380 --> 04:34:14,040

4255
04:34:14,720 --> 04:34:15,920
I'm in love with someone else.

4256
04:34:18,120 --> 04:34:19,240
Super chat.

4257
04:34:19,600 --> 04:34:20,860

How could you?

4259
04:34:22,480 --> 04:34:23,680
I wouldn't even love yourself.

4260
04:34:24,520 --> 04:34:27,540
All you do is torture yourself with work you can't do
anymore.

4261
04:34:28,120 --> 04:34:29,000

04:35:34,850 --> 04:35:36,370
Don't call Matara that.

4275
04:35:37,130 --> 04:35:45,290
Your husband refused to do as you was told all they had to
do was write what i wanted him to write now it's too late

4276
04:35:45,290 --> 04:36:04,590
it's his fault you'll stay here forever the done oh my god
this part's so funny now you will never get her back why why

4277
04:36:09,250 --> 04:36:11,670
I am much older than you.

4278
04:36:11,970 --> 04:36:12,630
Yeah, I know.

4279
04:36:13,750 --> 04:36:16,010
Older than your first work of art.

4280
04:36:16,690 --> 04:36:17,730
What does that have to do with it?

4281
04:36:18,130 --> 04:36:19,930
I will find a new face to wear.

4282
04:36:20,350 --> 04:36:22,950
Ah, someone else to dream me free.

4283
04:36:24,630 --> 04:36:25,090
I...

4284
04:36:25,090 --> 04:36:25,330
Oh!

4285
04:36:27,010 --> 04:36:29,350
She hasn't been embraced like that in a long time.

4286
04:36:31,650 --> 04:36:32,690
Good clicker!

4287
04:36:35,230 --> 04:36:35,490
Oh,

4288
04:36:48,080 --> 04:36:49,020
Bill's with the line.

4289
04:36:50,420 --> 04:36:51,520
Yeah, get clicked.

4290
04:36:51,700 --> 04:36:52,540
Yeah!

4291
04:36:53,500 --> 04:36:53,760
Yeah!

4292
04:36:54,060 --> 04:36:55,060
Get clicked!

4293
04:36:58,140 --> 04:36:58,740
Elbozo!

4294
04:37:02,490 --> 04:37:04,950
Alan Hug was too much for her.

4295
04:37:07,490 --> 04:37:08,670
Alan Hug!

4296
04:37:10,010 --> 04:37:10,030
I

4297
04:37:13,410 --> 04:37:16,590
could feel Alice's presence close by.

4298
04:37:18,430 --> 04:37:20,350
I understood what I had to do now.

4299
04:37:20,430 --> 04:37:21,530
What happens when you turn 30?

4300
04:37:21,930 --> 04:37:22,770
I knew how to write the ending to departure.

4301
04:37:22,810 --> 04:37:24,470
Yeah, you're like...

4302
04:37:24,470 --> 04:37:25,830
There's light and there's darkness.

4303
04:37:25,830 --> 04:37:26,350
I am older than you.

4304
04:37:26,830 --> 04:37:27,650
cause and effect.

4305
04:37:27,950 --> 04:37:29,210
There's guilt and there's atonement.

4306
04:37:30,150 --> 04:37:31,710
But the scales always need to balance.

4307
04:37:31,910 --> 04:37:32,990
Everything has a price.

4308
04:37:33,290 --> 04:37:34,490
That's where Zane had gone wrong.

4309
04:37:38,450 --> 04:37:40,750
There's a long journey through the night back into the
light.

4310
04:37:42,450 --> 04:37:45,030
Eight months old is technically hag territory for roaches.

4311
04:37:45,430 --> 04:37:45,950
Alice?

4312
04:37:47,650 --> 04:37:48,170
Alice?

4313
04:37:48,170 --> 04:37:48,690
Alice?

4314
04:37:53,110 --> 04:37:54,830
What happened to the FBI guy?

4315
04:37:54,970 --> 04:37:55,430
Did he die?

4316
04:37:56,450 --> 04:37:57,130
Oh, no.

4317
04:37:58,050 --> 04:37:58,890
Oh, no.

4318
04:38:01,170 --> 04:38:02,090
Oh, no!

4319
04:38:11,400 --> 04:38:12,520
A million hours.

4320
04:38:12,680 --> 04:38:14,480
That's what it felt like playing this game.

4321
04:38:14,720 --> 04:38:15,340
No, just kidding.

4322
04:38:31,920 --> 04:38:34,260
My guy is constantly diving into water.

4323
04:38:34,380 --> 04:38:38,960
My guy is constantly just doing the most.

4324
04:38:41,100 --> 04:38:43,400
I think we should just get rid of the whole town.

4325
04:38:44,800 --> 04:38:45,140
Alice!

4326
04:38:45,560 --> 04:38:46,300
She swam!

4327
04:38:46,520 --> 04:38:47,100
She swam!

4328
04:38:48,060 --> 04:38:49,280
Oh my god, that's what we wrote.

4329
04:38:49,660 --> 04:38:51,540
She swam really hard.

4330
04:38:53,840 --> 04:38:54,900
She swam good.

4331
04:38:55,560 --> 04:38:59,520
Actually, she was an Olympic swimmer.

4332
04:38:59,940 --> 04:39:02,160
So she could swim a lot.

4333
04:39:06,600 --> 04:39:09,360
I'm literally, that's what he's typing right now.

4334
04:39:12,140 --> 04:39:14,880
Oh my gosh, we got Alice back.

4335
04:39:15,120 --> 04:39:16,140
That's crazy.

4336
04:39:17,900 --> 04:39:19,600
Wait, did he sacrifice himself though?

4337
04:39:21,420 --> 04:39:24,660
So Alice is alive, but he's...

4338
04:39:24,660 --> 04:39:24,660
Alan?

4339
04:39:24,960 --> 04:39:25,720
In the cabin?

4340
04:39:32,170 --> 04:39:33,170
Oh, no.

4341
04:39:36,300 --> 04:39:38,080
Balancing the scales, he said.

4342
04:39:41,640 --> 04:39:45,840
Oh, he was like, as long as she's alive, it's okay.

4343
04:39:46,720 --> 04:39:48,600
Zane wanted them to be together.

4344
04:39:49,400 --> 04:39:50,720
Flame, welcome to Babusha.

4345
04:39:50,820 --> 04:39:51,440
Thank you.

4346
04:39:53,920 --> 04:39:55,260
Alan, save.

4347
04:39:56,760 --> 04:39:58,560
Alan will never wake.

4348
04:39:58,800 --> 04:40:00,480
He'll never get breakfast.

4349
04:40:02,140 --> 04:40:02,480
No!

4350
04:40:03,760 --> 04:40:06,620
And Alice swam real good and beat the bad guy.

4351
04:40:07,860 --> 04:40:10,400
And then it never turned night ever again.

4352
04:40:13,040 --> 04:40:15,140
Because she was scared of dark.

4353
04:40:17,540 --> 04:40:19,300
Welcome to Bright Falls.

4354
04:40:21,800 --> 04:40:22,840
Alice swam good.

4355
04:40:23,140 --> 04:40:24,800
Wife and arms, spooch, smooch.

4356
04:40:25,580 --> 04:40:25,800
Oh!

4357
04:40:25,940 --> 04:40:28,340
Dear Festival is happening!

4358
04:40:30,480 --> 04:40:31,820
Oh my gosh, there's more than...

4359
04:40:31,820 --> 04:40:32,180
Wow!

4360
04:40:33,160 --> 04:40:35,940
We killed, like, half the population, but...

4361
04:40:36,760 --> 04:40:38,520
There's still 20 people left!

4362
04:40:42,700 --> 04:40:45,960
How is this heart with three sizes that day?

4363
04:40:46,080 --> 04:40:46,540
Oh!

4364
04:40:47,060 --> 04:40:47,880
The brothers!

4365
04:40:48,500 --> 04:40:49,920
They made it!

4366
04:40:50,020 --> 04:40:50,320
Oh!

4367
04:40:53,800 --> 04:40:54,200
Oh.

4368
04:40:54,780 --> 04:40:55,920

It's not a lake.

4389
04:46:23,740 --> 04:46:24,580
It's an ocean.

4390
04:46:26,380 --> 04:46:26,560

Minky is too cute.

4394
04:46:34,580 --> 04:46:37,900
And there's nothing I can do.

4395
04:46:47,560 --> 04:46:48,820
Don't worry, guys.

4396
04:46:48,960 --> 04:46:50,620
I know that I played.

4397
04:46:51,020 --> 04:47:01,920
Alan Wake 1 to get to Alan Wake 2, but I was fully informed
of playing control in between this and Alan Wake, so I, and

4398
04:47:01,920 --> 04:47:14,200
Alan Wake 2, I mean, so I do plan on playing it like that,
so don't worry, don't worry, fully informed, yes, by the

4399
04:47:14,200 --> 04:47:17,340
many people in chat that told me.

4400
04:47:18,760 --> 04:47:19,800
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

4401
04:47:22,700 --> 04:47:28,060
American Nightmare, we'll see if I want to, I kind of want
to just, like, that's not a mainline game, like, main story

4402
04:47:28,060 --> 04:47:28,560
game, right?

4403
04:47:28,800 --> 04:47:34,000
So, I kind of want to just, like, play the, I want to get to
Alan Wake 2.

4404
04:47:34,180 --> 04:47:35,980
Maybe we'll see it after Alan Wake 2.

4405
04:47:38,600 --> 04:47:40,040
It's not canon, yeah.

4406
04:47:45,960 --> 04:47:51,380
I, I, I originally started this because I was like, man,
I've heard such good things about Alan Wake 2.

4407
04:47:51,480 --> 04:47:52,700
I want to know the hype.

4408
04:47:53,760 --> 04:47:54,320
So...

4409
04:47:54,320 --> 04:47:55,620
Oh my gosh, Sam Lake!

4410
04:47:57,760 --> 04:47:58,320
He...

4411
04:47:58,320 --> 04:48:00,540
He was next to Alan Wake!

4412
04:48:02,220 --> 04:48:03,300
Did he do that on purpose?

4413
04:48:04,960 --> 04:48:09,280
Wait, Minto, did you know the darkness wears her face?

4414
04:48:09,420 --> 04:48:09,720
No!

4415
04:48:10,060 --> 04:48:13,060
Also, if you told me that...

4416
04:48:14,480 --> 04:48:15,040
That...

4417
04:48:15,040 --> 04:48:18,180
Don't trust anyone in the dark, I would be shocked.

4418
04:48:19,580 --> 04:48:20,440
I don't...

4419
04:48:20,440 --> 04:48:21,240
I...

4420
04:48:21,240 --> 04:48:22,780
I don't even know.

4421
04:48:23,060 --> 04:48:24,440
Do you trust anyone that are?

4422
04:48:24,520 --> 04:48:26,300
Never, never, never.

4423
04:48:28,040 --> 04:48:29,380
100 on purpose.

4424
04:48:32,820 --> 04:48:35,320
Halo Infinite actually is next chronologically.

4425
04:48:35,660 --> 04:48:38,140
Oh, well, I cancel my stream tomorrow.

4426
04:48:38,740 --> 04:48:39,980
We're going to play Halo Infinite.

4427
04:48:43,640 --> 04:48:45,280
It's not a Sam Lake.

4428
04:48:45,560 --> 04:48:46,840
It's a Sam Ocean.

4429
04:48:50,720 --> 04:48:51,800
Then the SpongeBob...

4430
04:48:51,800 --> 04:48:53,040
The SpongeBob...

4431
04:48:53,060 --> 04:48:54,000
SpongeBob movie.

4432
04:48:56,440 --> 04:48:57,440
Big pants.

4433
04:48:57,700 --> 04:48:58,240
Big guy.

4434
04:48:58,560 --> 04:48:59,080
Big pants.

4435
04:48:59,200 --> 04:49:00,100
Which SpongeBob movie?

4436
04:49:00,220 --> 04:49:00,820
The newest one?

4437
04:49:01,220 --> 04:49:02,900
Because if so, oof.

4438
04:49:03,620 --> 04:49:04,480
We might skip.

4439
04:49:05,180 --> 04:49:06,060
Spang baby.

4440
04:49:10,610 --> 04:49:11,810
I can't believe.

4441
04:49:12,010 --> 04:49:12,690
Wait, so.

4442
04:49:13,610 --> 04:49:17,070
If Rose becomes the new Cynthia, what happened to Cynthia?

4443
04:49:17,390 --> 04:49:18,570
What happened to Barry?

4444
04:49:21,590 --> 04:49:22,310
Barry.

4445
04:49:28,830 --> 04:49:29,050
Wait.

4446
04:49:29,450 --> 04:49:32,030
Did they ever leave the room?

4447
04:49:32,490 --> 04:49:33,570
The well-lit room?

4448
04:49:35,490 --> 04:49:36,410
DLC answers?

4449
04:49:36,650 --> 04:49:37,270
Okay, good.

4450
04:49:40,880 --> 04:49:41,960
She got clicked.

4451
04:49:44,880 --> 04:49:48,300
Did she disappear because of...

4452
04:49:48,860 --> 04:49:51,960
Anyone that knew of Zane, did they all have to disappear?

4453
04:49:55,080 --> 04:49:56,380
Whoa, my goodness!

4454
04:49:56,600 --> 04:49:57,800
Look at their multiple...

4455
04:49:57,800 --> 04:49:58,160
Wow!

4456
04:49:59,440 --> 04:50:00,840
Talented people!

4457
04:50:01,680 --> 04:50:04,080
Playing so many roles.

4458
04:50:05,640 --> 04:50:06,600
Night Springs narrator.

4459
04:50:09,840 --> 04:50:10,460
Wow.

4460
04:50:12,380 --> 04:50:13,000
Taken.

4461
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:16,920
Night Springs man number one.

4462
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:17,460
Deputy.

4463
04:50:17,840 --> 04:50:19,240
Night Springs dreamer.

4464
04:50:19,540 --> 04:50:19,740
Deputy.

4465
04:50:20,300 --> 04:50:20,620
Taken.

4466
04:50:22,240 --> 04:50:22,900
I would...

4467
04:50:22,900 --> 04:50:23,400
Oh my gosh.

4468
04:50:23,500 --> 04:50:26,040
I would love to play one of the Taken in this game.

4469
04:50:26,700 --> 04:50:28,380
What kind of line would you want to say?

4470
04:50:28,500 --> 04:50:29,240
They're so funny.

4471
04:50:30,660 --> 04:50:31,280
I'm not...

4472
04:50:31,300 --> 04:50:32,720
I want to say a taken line.

4473
04:50:34,920 --> 04:50:36,440
Do you think you'll still call him Alan Wick?

4474
04:50:36,700 --> 04:50:37,880
I don't think so.

4475
04:50:41,120 --> 04:50:45,600
Because I got so used to being like, Alan jump.

4476
04:50:46,200 --> 04:50:47,480
You know, Alan wake up.

4477
04:50:47,700 --> 04:50:49,160
I think I get it now.

4478
04:50:50,980 --> 04:50:51,680
I think I'm okay.

4479
04:50:51,840 --> 04:50:52,420
I think I'm okay.

4480
04:50:52,660 --> 04:50:53,480
I think I'm cured.

4481
04:50:54,280 --> 04:50:56,220
John Wick, Alan Wake.

4482
04:50:56,660 --> 04:50:57,640
I know the difference.

4483
04:50:57,800 --> 04:50:58,760
I know the difference.

4484
04:50:59,300 --> 04:51:00,300
I know.

4485
04:51:01,300 --> 04:51:02,240
That was my controller.

4486
04:51:04,440 --> 04:51:06,040
I know the difference.

4487
04:51:11,980 --> 04:51:13,580
Character development.

4488
04:51:15,420 --> 04:51:16,220
I...

4489
04:51:17,320 --> 04:51:19,980
Maybe that would be my line in Alan Wake.

4490
04:51:21,180 --> 04:51:26,160
And be like, Have you watched critically acclaimed John Wick
movie?

4491
04:51:29,100 --> 04:51:32,120
You know, there were no girl taken.

4492
04:51:33,740 --> 04:51:35,480
Now that I think about it.

4493
04:51:37,940 --> 04:51:41,240
American Nightmare answers what happens to Barry, but I
thought it wasn't canon.

4494
04:51:42,060 --> 04:51:42,640
Congrats on being cured.

4495
04:51:42,780 --> 04:51:43,880
Thank you!

4496
04:51:50,120 --> 04:51:50,500
Yeah.

4497
04:51:52,580 --> 04:51:54,380
There were no girl taken.

4498
04:51:57,320 --> 04:51:59,040
Your line wouldn't be Metal Gear related.

4499
04:52:02,280 --> 04:52:04,320
How could we make it Metal Gear related?

4500
04:52:06,140 --> 04:52:09,260
Alan Wake's journey through the night will continue!

4501
04:52:12,180 --> 04:52:13,420
Oh my god!

4502
04:52:19,280 --> 04:52:24,020
Unable to log into Epic Online Services, please check your
connection and restart.

4503
04:52:27,620 --> 04:52:28,820
Did you finish John Wake?

4504
04:52:28,900 --> 04:52:30,220
I only watched the first one.

4505
04:52:37,920 --> 04:52:41,260
Wait, I kind of want to watch this again and see what we
recognize now.

4506
04:52:41,260 --> 04:52:59,280
I saved my wife Hot dog Hot dog indeed Or save it Oh Yeah
that part was kind of poopy Stupid FBI guy Thanks for coming

4507
04:52:59,280 --> 04:53:11,240
up On up to Deerfest Hope we can make it back for the next
fest I don't think I ever want to go to the PNW Because I

4508
04:53:11,260 --> 04:53:13,420
I'm just going to fear this game.

4509
04:53:14,120 --> 04:53:17,660
I'm going to be so scared of running around in the forest.

4510
04:53:18,460 --> 04:53:20,380
Forever and ever and ever.

4511
04:53:24,700 --> 04:53:26,540
Do you all see you next week?

4512
04:53:28,280 --> 04:53:29,140
Maybe next week.

4513
04:53:31,000 --> 04:53:31,560
Maybe, maybe.

4514
04:53:32,260 --> 04:53:34,340
There are only like four women in the entire town.

4515
04:53:34,540 --> 04:53:36,460
So yeah, I'm not shocked by the lack of Taken ladies.

4516
04:53:36,600 --> 04:53:36,820
You know what?

4517
04:53:36,820 --> 04:53:37,500
That's so fair.

4518
04:53:39,500 --> 04:53:41,240
All the Taken guys were like at...

4519
04:53:41,260 --> 04:53:49,260
you know what also all the guys that were taken were the
zane is so funny where ever it seemed like they were taken

4520
04:53:49,260 --> 04:54:02,420
at work most of the time like you had like the lumberjacks
and you had you had your uh you had your uh guys at the

4521
04:54:02,420 --> 04:54:05,980
power plant but minke think of the deer

4522
04:54:11,260 --> 04:54:16,860
is canon but it's a side story think of it to mgr to mgs

And I writeeth.

4533
04:55:18,510 --> 04:55:21,470
This game is so wackadoodle, it's so funny.

4534
04:55:23,270 --> 04:55:24,490
It's like just...

4535
04:55:24,490 --> 04:55:27,190
What's so funny about it is it...

4536
04:55:28,070 --> 04:55:31,770
I don't want to say it completely takes itself seriously,
because it doesn't.

4537
04:55:33,710 --> 04:55:36,290
But it's so like...

4538
04:55:36,290 --> 04:55:41,150
It's so funny in that it'll be like, Oh no, my...

4539
04:55:41,690 --> 04:55:42,210
Oh, whoops.

4540
04:55:42,530 --> 04:55:43,270
My girlfriend.

4541
04:55:43,610 --> 04:55:44,930
Or my wife is gone.

4542
04:55:44,930 --> 04:55:50,310
Yeah, it plays it straight, even though it's so silly.

4543
04:55:50,610 --> 04:55:51,430
It's so fun.

4544
04:55:53,190 --> 04:55:54,250
It's so, so funny.

4545
04:55:54,770 --> 04:55:55,830
This is my kind of game.

4546
04:55:55,970 --> 04:55:56,930
I had so much fun.

4547
04:55:57,850 --> 04:55:58,410
Oh, dude.

4548
04:55:59,910 --> 04:56:00,990
Here, we're gonna skip.

4549
04:56:01,110 --> 04:56:02,090
We're gonna move.

4550
04:56:02,990 --> 04:56:04,170
We're gonna move over.

4551
04:56:04,670 --> 04:56:06,790
We can chat for a little bit before I...

4552
04:56:06,790 --> 04:56:08,450
I was fully prepared.

4553
04:56:08,510 --> 04:56:10,490
I thought at least, like, another hour or so.

4554
04:56:10,890 --> 04:56:11,250
Awesome.

4555
04:56:17,880 --> 04:56:19,750
Cool, cool, cool.

4556
04:56:22,140 --> 04:56:23,720
Uh, actually?

4557
04:56:24,820 --> 04:56:27,440
Is this gonna work?

4558
04:56:29,000 --> 04:56:31,040
Where the heck is the desk?

4559
04:56:33,520 --> 04:56:34,540
What?

4560
04:56:35,180 --> 04:56:36,600
Oh, there it is.

4561
04:56:37,880 --> 04:56:40,480
My scenes are all messed up recently.

4562
04:56:43,620 --> 04:56:45,200
Where's the table?

4563
04:56:50,400 --> 04:56:51,480
Where am I?

4564
04:56:52,060 --> 04:56:53,520
Oh, I went down, that's right.

4565
04:56:55,600 --> 04:56:57,520
I went below.

4566
04:56:58,820 --> 04:56:59,120
Yay!

4567
04:56:59,600 --> 04:57:00,720
Let me put on some music.

4568
04:57:01,000 --> 04:57:01,480
Wait, hold on.

4569
04:57:02,360 --> 04:57:03,640
Let's quit the game.

4570
04:57:03,920 --> 04:57:04,820
Wait, what's the extras?

4571
04:57:05,900 --> 04:57:07,420
What are my stats?

4572
04:57:08,100 --> 04:57:08,580
Wait!

4573
04:57:09,060 --> 04:57:10,240
I want to see my stats.

4574
04:57:10,640 --> 04:57:11,800
Wait, hold on.

4575
04:57:14,480 --> 04:57:15,340
Where's the game?

4576
04:57:16,000 --> 04:57:17,200
The game?

4577
04:57:17,360 --> 04:57:18,700
Oh, guys.

4578
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:24,160
Guys, killed with the revolver.

4579
04:57:25,420 --> 04:57:26,260
149.

4580
04:57:26,380 --> 04:57:27,100
It's like a Pokemon.

4581
04:57:28,460 --> 04:57:29,840
At least 150.

4582
04:57:30,780 --> 04:57:32,100
One more to see.

4583
04:57:32,420 --> 04:57:34,020
I killed 800 birds.

4584
04:57:35,860 --> 04:57:40,620
I found 72 out of 100 thermoses.

4585
04:57:44,290 --> 04:57:47,610
Wait, I still missed so many chests also.

4586
04:57:48,070 --> 04:57:49,130
I missed a radiant...

4587
04:57:49,130 --> 04:57:49,350
Wait.

4588
04:57:50,670 --> 04:57:55,870
I wonder if it counts the one that I didn't turn on, even
though I had turned it on before.

4589
04:57:58,810 --> 04:58:01,890
There were cardboard standees and alarm clocks.

4590
04:58:02,670 --> 04:58:04,370
Night Springs video games.

4591
04:58:04,770 --> 04:58:05,890
What the...

4592
04:58:05,890 --> 04:58:07,030
Wait, signs found.

4593
04:58:07,170 --> 04:58:07,650
What does that mean?

4594
04:58:07,750 --> 04:58:09,190
Oh, like the things I could read maybe?

4595
04:58:10,690 --> 04:58:12,090
Indirect kill 65.

4596
04:58:12,410 --> 04:58:13,770
No, they were all on purpose.

4597
04:58:16,530 --> 04:58:18,030
Poltergeist objects destroyed.

4598
04:58:19,290 --> 04:58:20,590
240 batteries.

4599
04:58:21,250 --> 04:58:24,150
Kills with flashbangs, kills with vehicles.

4600
04:58:30,200 --> 04:58:35,420
I didn't even know that you could find standees or alarm
clocks or video games.

4601
04:58:36,080 --> 04:58:36,960
What the heck?

4602
04:58:37,760 --> 04:58:39,180
The last items are from the DLC.

4603
04:58:41,060 --> 04:58:42,100
Oh, that makes sense.

4604
04:58:49,060 --> 04:58:49,700
Playback.

4605
04:58:50,940 --> 04:58:52,000
Oh, fine.

4606
04:58:54,520 --> 04:58:55,760
Oh, fine.

4607
04:58:58,640 --> 04:59:01,140
David Bowie's Space Oddity.

4608
04:59:01,800 --> 04:59:03,360
Let's go sing Space Oddity.

4609
04:59:06,100 --> 04:59:07,590
Let's go sing it.

4610
04:59:18,130 --> 04:59:19,750
Karaoke time.

4611
04:59:21,270 --> 04:59:23,470
Since you guys didn't get to hear it at all.

4612
04:59:31,200 --> 04:59:32,480
You guys didn't get to hear it.

4613
05:00:04,590 --> 05:00:07,580
Round control to Major Tom.

4614
05:00:08,620 --> 05:00:29,800
vocal ground control to major Tom take your protein pills
and put your helmet on ground control to major Tom

4615
05:00:29,800 --> 05:00:36,800
commencing countdown engines on

4616
05:00:40,180 --> 05:00:47,180
Check ignition and may God's love be with you.

4617
05:00:57,210 --> 05:01:01,830
This is ground control to Major Tom.

4618
05:01:02,610 --> 05:01:05,390
You've really made the grave.

4619
05:01:07,510 --> 05:01:12,390
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear.

4620
05:01:12,410 --> 05:01:33,130
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare This is Major
Tom to ground control I'm stepping through the door And I'm

4621
05:01:33,130 --> 05:01:56,850
floating in a most peculiar way And the stars look very
different Today For here Am I sitting in a tin can Far above

4622
05:01:56,850 --> 05:02:10,650
the world Planet Earth is blue And there's nothing I can do
BAMB

4623
05:02:37,300 --> 05:02:41,960
Though I'm thinking past 100,000 miles.

4624
05:02:42,240 --> 05:02:45,440
I'm feeling very still.

4625
05:02:47,480 --> 05:02:51,940
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.

4626
05:02:54,080 --> 05:02:57,700
Tell my wife I love her very much.

4627
05:02:57,960 --> 05:02:59,740
She knows!

4628
05:03:01,500 --> 05:03:06,660
Ground control to major time your circuit's dead.

4629
05:03:06,660 --> 05:03:08,380
There's something wrong.

4630
05:03:08,640 --> 05:03:11,060
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

4631
05:03:11,960 --> 05:03:14,820
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

4632
05:03:15,580 --> 05:03:18,240
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

4633
05:03:18,940 --> 05:03:20,680
Can you hear?

4634
05:03:22,060 --> 05:03:38,100
Am I floating around my tin can Far above the moon The
planet's earth is blue And there's nothing I can do

4635
05:03:50,980 --> 05:03:51,860
So good!

4636
05:04:12,140 --> 05:04:14,540
Since you guys didn't get to hear it in the credits!

4637
05:04:18,420 --> 05:04:21,140
I love this song so much, it's so good!

4638
05:04:26,450 --> 05:04:29,310
Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee!

4639
05:04:32,340 --> 05:04:33,700
Do you guys have any plans for this weekend?

4640
05:04:36,200 --> 05:04:37,760
Anything you're planning on doing?

4641
05:04:38,600 --> 05:04:39,840
Anything you got going on?

4642
05:04:45,920 --> 05:04:49,340
I was never a Bowie fan until I listened with you.

4643
05:04:49,380 --> 05:04:50,400
What do you mean?

4644
05:04:52,560 --> 05:04:53,780
I'm in space.

4645
05:04:53,980 --> 05:04:55,380
You are in space.

4646
05:04:57,380 --> 05:04:59,260
Building gumball fun.

4647
05:04:59,740 --> 05:05:00,200
Chilling.

4648
05:05:00,420 --> 05:05:01,400
Work, unfortunately.

4649
05:05:01,640 --> 05:05:02,700
No, you're sick and bad.

4650
05:05:02,780 --> 05:05:03,580
Feel better.

4651
05:05:04,040 --> 05:05:04,640
Feel better.

4652
05:05:04,920 --> 05:05:05,380
Beam.

4653
05:05:07,080 --> 05:05:08,760
Hey, Ximinto, that was beautiful.

4654
05:05:08,980 --> 05:05:09,640
Of course.

4655
05:05:12,220 --> 05:05:14,220
Let me see, um...

4656
05:05:17,260 --> 05:05:19,340
Uh, what's this one?

4657
05:05:31,880 --> 05:05:34,060
Resident Evil Marathon before the new game.

4658
05:05:34,440 --> 05:05:35,860
Wait, when does the new game come out?

4659
05:05:36,240 --> 05:05:37,200
Did they announce it?

4660
05:05:37,580 --> 05:05:38,180
Thank you, Minto.

4661
05:05:38,780 --> 05:05:39,560
Thank you!

4662
05:05:41,440 --> 05:05:42,360
Iron Lung.

4663
05:05:43,060 --> 05:05:44,220
I want to go see it.

4664
05:05:44,960 --> 05:05:48,230
I heard that it has like practical effects and stuff and
that it's...

4665
05:05:49,140 --> 05:05:50,060
February 27th!

4666
05:05:50,100 --> 05:05:51,260
Wow, that's so soon!

4667
05:05:52,160 --> 05:05:53,600
Oh my gosh.

4668
05:05:53,900 --> 05:05:55,620
I had no idea it was so soon.

4669
05:05:56,680 --> 05:05:57,800
That's exciting.

4670
05:06:01,540 --> 05:06:10,200
I kind of wish that I did a that I did a that I caught up,
you know.

4671
05:06:11,140 --> 05:06:12,180
The Markiplier one.

4672
05:06:13,920 --> 05:06:16,540
My mom bought me a streaming ticket for your jazz concert.

4673
05:06:17,300 --> 05:06:18,160
Thank you, mom.

4674
05:06:20,240 --> 05:06:23,440
The mortuary assistant is also are releasing on the 13th.

4675
05:06:27,200 --> 05:06:27,500
Game?

4676
05:06:34,520 --> 05:06:34,920
Movie?

4677
05:06:35,560 --> 05:06:38,500
Wasn't there there was an AirDorf movie?

4678
05:06:39,540 --> 05:06:40,820
They made a movie!

4679
05:06:42,460 --> 05:06:44,400
Wait, I must go see it!

4680
05:06:44,480 --> 05:06:45,200
Wait, hold on.

4681
05:06:46,400 --> 05:06:47,500
Mortuary Assistant.

4682
05:06:48,720 --> 05:06:50,380
I loved that game.

4683
05:06:51,840 --> 05:06:54,140
Wait, there's a... Wait, can we watch the movie trailer?

4684
05:06:54,640 --> 05:06:55,880
Wait, let's watch the movie trailer together.

4685
05:06:55,940 --> 05:06:56,880
It might be kind of spooky, though.

4686
05:06:56,920 --> 05:06:57,680
Are you guys okay with that?

4687
05:06:58,140 --> 05:06:59,920
Oh, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

4688
05:07:02,480 --> 05:07:03,920
It put me in like a...

4689
05:07:08,620 --> 05:07:10,240
Yeah, okay, hold on.

4690
05:07:10,560 --> 05:07:12,680
Resident Evil Marathon and my life is yours.

4691
05:07:21,130 --> 05:07:22,290
Oh, what joy is this?

4692
05:07:25,150 --> 05:07:26,030
Oh, this works.

4693
05:07:26,270 --> 05:07:27,430
It's like, put me in.

4694
05:07:27,570 --> 05:07:28,970
There we go, hold on.

4695
05:07:29,610 --> 05:07:30,290
There we go.

4696
05:07:31,090 --> 05:07:32,010
I'll put it below me.

4697
05:07:34,730 --> 05:07:36,650
I had no idea about this.

4698
05:07:36,690 --> 05:07:38,830
This game really spooks me.

4699
05:07:39,670 --> 05:07:43,190
I love on Beyond's games more than anything, you know?

4700
05:07:46,970 --> 05:07:47,850
So, um...

4701
05:07:47,850 --> 05:07:49,030
You got room in this chair?

4702
05:07:49,270 --> 05:07:50,030
Okay, I'm...

4703
05:07:50,030 --> 05:07:50,250
It worked.

4704
05:07:52,570 --> 05:07:54,170
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot over.

4705
05:07:54,510 --> 05:07:55,250
Scoot, scoot, scoot over.

4706
05:07:57,850 --> 05:07:59,610
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot over.

4707
05:08:01,270 --> 05:08:03,010
Big buttoot hog in the whole thing.

4708
05:08:03,710 --> 05:08:07,790
Okay, let's uh, where'd I put the, wait, where'd the,
where'd the window go?

4709
05:08:07,910 --> 05:08:08,190
Oh, there it is.

4710
05:08:08,290 --> 05:08:08,330
Okay.

4711
05:08:08,850 --> 05:08:09,090
All right.

4712
05:08:09,230 --> 05:08:10,370
Three, two, one.

4713
05:08:14,310 --> 05:08:16,170
All right, Mr. Leibowitz.

4714
05:08:16,630 --> 05:08:19,590
Let's get you en-bombed and I guess- She said shutter.

4715
05:08:19,790 --> 05:08:20,790
So is it on the shutter?

4716
05:08:22,230 --> 05:08:22,550
Terrifier!

4717
05:08:22,690 --> 05:08:24,130
Oh no, is it going to be boring?

4718
05:08:28,910 --> 05:08:29,230
Slapface.

4719
05:08:29,990 --> 05:08:30,110
Slapface.

4720
05:08:36,450 --> 05:08:54,160
is somebody there I know what you experienced was terrifying
but you need to listen to me if you want to survive the

4721
05:08:54,160 --> 05:09:09,360
entity will do anything to gain control oh my god I remember
this part oh my god I want this to stop Please!

4722
05:09:10,800 --> 05:09:12,200
To banish a demon to hell.

4723
05:09:13,860 --> 05:09:15,280
Oh my gosh.

4724
05:09:15,420 --> 05:09:16,400
You need to learn its name.

4725
05:09:18,960 --> 05:09:19,120
Oh!

4726
05:09:19,500 --> 05:09:21,140
Do I have something that you wish?

4727
05:09:21,840 --> 05:09:23,840
I wonder what ending they'll go for.

4728
05:09:24,920 --> 05:09:26,000
You need to get off the phone.

4729
05:09:27,180 --> 05:09:28,240
You have to help me.

4730
05:09:28,520 --> 05:09:29,680
Oh my gosh, that's that guy!

4731
05:09:30,140 --> 05:09:30,980
That's me.

4732
05:09:33,400 --> 05:09:36,320
The demon knows everything about you.

4733
05:09:38,260 --> 05:09:39,420
So what do we do?

4734
05:09:39,520 --> 05:09:40,420
It looks fine.

4735
05:09:40,860 --> 05:09:42,260
Oh my gosh, I'm like recognizing everything.

4736
05:09:43,000 --> 05:09:46,040
I'm like the houses of hell.

4737
05:09:46,180 --> 05:09:47,760
I command you back.

4738
05:09:47,980 --> 05:09:49,100
Okay, I don't remember that.

4739
05:09:51,800 --> 05:09:52,320
Ew.

4740
05:09:53,020 --> 05:09:53,240
Oh.

4741
05:09:57,420 --> 05:09:58,660
It's pretty icky.

4742
05:10:00,480 --> 05:10:02,600
The possessed ending is most likely.

4743
05:10:02,700 --> 05:10:03,200
You think so?

4744
05:10:03,700 --> 05:10:05,420
It's actually in theaters.

4745
05:10:05,920 --> 05:10:06,320
What?

4746
05:10:07,340 --> 05:10:09,140
Wait, I'm the 13th.

4747
05:10:09,700 --> 05:10:10,620
Oh my gosh, Valentine.

4748
05:10:10,740 --> 05:10:11,440
Wait, that's one of my shows.

4749
05:10:11,460 --> 05:10:24,820

4752
05:10:42,620 --> 05:10:44,000
Don't show canceled.

4753
05:10:44,260 --> 05:10:45,380
Don't want to do that.

4754
05:10:47,460 --> 05:10:48,660
We go watch.

4755
05:10:49,720 --> 05:10:51,200
Surely it's not going to come out at night.

4756
05:10:52,360 --> 05:10:53,760
That's not how movies work.

4757
05:10:54,640 --> 05:10:58,740
They have a daytime showing, too.

4758
05:11:00,640 --> 05:11:01,780
Oh, scary.

4759
05:11:03,460 --> 05:11:05,500
Oh, that game really freaks me out.

4760
05:11:05,600 --> 05:11:06,260
I hope it's anything.

4761
05:11:06,440 --> 05:11:06,980
It looks...

4762
05:11:06,980 --> 05:11:07,340
I don't know.

4763
05:11:07,380 --> 05:11:08,840
The trailer makes it seem like...

4764
05:11:08,840 --> 05:11:11,440
It's always those kind of trailers that make it seem like
more.

4765
05:11:11,460 --> 05:11:19,560
more action-y, you know, than how the original was.

4766
05:11:21,600 --> 05:11:23,500
Do you scream in the theater?

4767
05:11:23,860 --> 05:11:24,740
I don't think so.

4768
05:11:25,380 --> 05:11:25,720
I don't know.

4769
05:11:25,760 --> 05:11:28,760
I don't know the last time I went and saw a horror movie in
the theater.

4770
05:11:30,220 --> 05:11:31,880
Have you seen the autopsy of Jane Doe?

4771
05:11:33,280 --> 05:11:36,400
Uh, yes, once a long time ago.

4772
05:11:37,420 --> 05:11:38,080
The true horror.

4773
05:11:38,200 --> 05:11:41,200
Hundreds of eyeballs descending on a single unsuspecting
theater.

4774
05:11:41,460 --> 05:11:45,980
I'm wondering, honestly, how well this movie is going to
perform.

4775
05:11:47,380 --> 05:11:49,500
Because I haven't heard anything about it.

4776
05:11:50,780 --> 05:11:53,460
Maybe I just haven't seen anything, but...

4777
05:12:01,180 --> 05:12:02,800
That's the scariest part.

4778
05:12:03,300 --> 05:12:04,300
Iron Lung is doing great.

4779
05:12:04,440 --> 05:12:04,860
Yeah!

4780
05:12:05,440 --> 05:12:12,280
I heard that Markiplier even said that he made a profit
before the movie came out, which is kind of crazy.

4781
05:12:24,710 --> 05:12:25,310
How?

4782
05:12:25,330 --> 05:12:26,190
I don't know.

4783
05:12:26,690 --> 05:12:28,130
Maybe pre-order tickets?

4784
05:12:28,510 --> 05:12:31,470
I don't know how it works, to be honest.

4785
05:12:32,210 --> 05:12:33,370
I honestly don't know.

4786
05:12:35,990 --> 05:12:37,370
A singular prophet.

4787
05:12:38,610 --> 05:12:39,790
I heard, though, it was pretty good.

4788
05:12:39,910 --> 05:12:47,050
Like, I saw, I've seen reviews from people that played the
game and also like Markiplier, and then I've seen reviews

4789
05:12:47,050 --> 05:12:54,670
from people that know of Markiplier and are, like, more
movie people and don't know the source material, which I

4790
05:12:54,670 --> 05:13:03,390
honestly think, those kinds of reviews are more valuable
than someone that does know the source material because as

4791
05:13:03,390 --> 05:13:13,570
much as I love like a fan service you know you gotta make it
you gotta make it digestible to everybody you know you can't

4792
05:13:13,570 --> 05:13:22,770
just have me being pointing at the screen the whole time
being like I get it I know that reference you know but yeah

4793
05:13:22,770 --> 05:13:31,430
it's gotta be good on the cord yeah yeah yeah so i as from
the from the reviews of people that don't know the game they

4794
05:13:31,430 --> 05:13:41,810
kind of were like they liked it they said it was good just
that there were some parts that were kind of confusing so

4795
05:13:41,810 --> 05:13:44,830
like what was expected of the minecraft movie

4796
05:13:48,870 --> 05:14:03,330
you don't like fan service for the most part i kind of love
fan service i'm not gonna lie a time and place like say it

4797
05:14:03,330 --> 05:14:17,410
depends on how it's marketed you know like if it's marketed
to fans then it's it's i think it's okay but if it's like hi

4798
05:14:17,410 --> 05:14:20,930
hi come check out my movie then

4799
05:14:24,350 --> 05:14:34,030
then yeah I think it's like well I get it but you know you
want people to like the thing that you like so that you can

4800
05:14:34,030 --> 05:14:43,410
get more of the thing that you like you know what I mean
that's just the truth of the matter that's just the truth of

4801
05:14:43,410 --> 05:14:54,710
the matter but yeah it's very cool we've been getting well i
was about to say we've been getting like all these video

4802
05:14:54,710 --> 05:15:01,630
game actually we've been getting all these like horror game
movie adaptations but i did you guys hear the reviews on the

4803
05:15:01,630 --> 05:15:10,450
silent i don't want to speak because i don't want karnami to
hear me

4804
05:15:25,240 --> 05:15:40,520
There's like, there was one Big change in the movie that
makes me It changes the story so much That it like Upsets me

4805
05:15:40,520 --> 05:15:46,660
to a To A crazy degree

4806
05:15:59,100 --> 05:16:09,920
I'm always like torn on like adaptations of video games
because I understand when people say well you've played if

4807
05:16:09,920 --> 05:16:17,060
you want the original story of the game play the game you've
seen the story of the game we're kind of changing it up a

4808
05:16:17,060 --> 05:16:21,120
little bit you know what I mean Yeah, the director did not
understand the game at all.

4809
05:16:21,440 --> 05:16:21,880
I know.

4810
05:16:22,240 --> 05:16:22,600
Oh my god.

4811
05:16:23,100 --> 05:16:23,100
Sorry.

4812
05:16:23,320 --> 05:16:23,760
It's rise.

4813
05:16:24,240 --> 05:16:26,820
It's it's been it's been driving me crazy the past couple of
days.

4814
05:16:27,000 --> 05:16:27,460
But anyway.

4815
05:16:38,360 --> 05:16:44,960
Like I understand when people are like, yeah, we're doing
like the same story, but kind of our own rendition of it.

4816
05:16:45,200 --> 05:16:45,680
I get it.

4817
05:16:46,180 --> 05:16:46,740
I get it.

4818
05:16:46,800 --> 05:16:48,340
I understand that mentality.

4819
05:16:49,280 --> 05:16:59,520
is it my favorite mentality not quite like i i understand it
but i'm always just like yeah but if you it's kind of like

4820
05:16:59,520 --> 05:17:07,560
with the disney live action remakes you know like how
they've been changing so many like they'll be like oh this

4821
05:17:07,560 --> 05:17:16,980
this uh we're doing a live action of snow white but we're
giving so and so a backstory and it's like what like the

4822
05:17:16,980 --> 05:17:25,720
thing about it is if you do a different okay so people like
the original right if you do something different there's not

4823
05:17:25,720 --> 05:17:34,260
there's always a chance that people are not gonna like it
you know what i mean so it's just kind of like you're it

4824
05:17:34,260 --> 05:17:42,080
almost feels like you're damned if you do damned if you
don't because if you make a faithful true adaptation then

4825
05:17:42,080 --> 05:17:43,500
people are like well i'm just gonna play the

4826
05:17:49,920 --> 05:17:52,720
Yeah, it's just...

4827
05:17:52,720 --> 05:18:03,280
Yeah, if you like Silent Hill 2, I heard that the
cinematography is really good.

4828
05:18:05,120 --> 05:18:07,620
That it has some cool shots in it.

4829
05:18:09,500 --> 05:18:12,440
Isn't the point to show the work to non-gamers?

4830
05:18:12,920 --> 05:18:16,380
I'm talking about adaptations all around.

4831
05:18:17,620 --> 05:18:18,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4832
05:18:18,460 --> 05:18:20,380
Not just gaming, game.

4833
05:18:20,920 --> 05:18:26,040
Because, I mean, you have adaptations of anime and stuff,
too.

4834
05:18:28,280 --> 05:18:28,940
What was that?

4835
05:18:30,800 --> 05:18:34,180
There was, like, that one movie with Tom Cruise in it.

4836
05:18:36,400 --> 05:18:39,180
The one where he keeps dying and being reborn.

4837
05:18:39,300 --> 05:18:40,660
That's an adaptation of an anime.

4838
05:18:41,220 --> 05:18:41,700
Or a manga?

4839
05:18:45,280 --> 05:18:46,220
Edge of Tomorrow!

4840
05:18:46,420 --> 05:18:47,100
Yes, yes, yes.

4841
05:18:47,260 --> 05:18:48,260
It's, uh...

4842
05:18:48,800 --> 05:18:49,920
Edge of tomorrow.

4843
05:18:52,000 --> 05:18:53,640
I liked the movie.

4844
05:18:53,860 --> 05:18:54,740
I liked that movie.

4845
05:18:56,960 --> 05:18:59,520
All you need is kill is that anime, I believe.

4846
05:19:00,440 --> 05:19:00,540
Right?

4847
05:19:02,280 --> 05:19:04,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

4848
05:19:05,000 --> 05:19:05,900
I like the movie.

4849
05:19:05,960 --> 05:19:07,840
I don't know anything about all you need is kill.

4850
05:19:08,240 --> 05:19:09,040
But I like the movie.

4851
05:19:09,640 --> 05:19:10,480
I did like the movie.

4852
05:19:12,660 --> 05:19:12,980
Yeah.

4853
05:19:13,560 --> 05:19:14,520
Movie was good.

4854
05:19:16,300 --> 05:19:17,960
There's a new anime movie for that too.

4855
05:19:18,460 --> 05:19:29,380
is i saw it recently the animation looks really interesting
yeah yeah yeah so see like that's a i guess a good example

4856
05:19:29,380 --> 05:19:35,000
but also at the same time i feel like nobody would know that
it is based off of a manga

4857
05:19:38,140 --> 05:19:43,960
getting an anime but fairly different visuals yeah egypt
tomorrow was nothing like the original

4858
05:19:48,450 --> 05:19:57,610
but you know you just can't the truth of the matter is too
you can't make everybody happy that's just that's just how

4859
05:19:57,610 --> 05:20:12,030
it goes you can't make everybody happy and that's why it's
nice that if a media comes out of something that you really

4860
05:20:12,030 --> 05:20:25,190
like be it a movie adaptation or whatever if you don't like
it you can ignore it and you can play the game and say wow I

4861
05:20:25,190 --> 05:20:33,250
like the game if you don't like something ignore it you'll
be much happier

4862
05:20:37,860 --> 05:20:39,460
ignoring yeah

4863
05:20:47,050 --> 05:21:01,090
what if we like VTuber named the made me channel don't
ignore don't ignore game bunga bunga yeah yeah yeah yeah

4864
05:21:01,090 --> 05:21:11,150
pretend not to see it's like oh i love i love thing it's so
great that thing exists and we don't talk about other stuff

4865
05:21:11,150 --> 05:21:27,350
a scene with the gravestone though oh in silent hills oh i
would give you guys spoilers but i i don't you know

4866
05:21:33,660 --> 05:21:44,460
did you watch it silent hill no no no no no i didn't and
that's okay i especially it was very weary i mean a lot of

4867
05:21:44,460 --> 05:21:52,720
people were from the trailers alone a lot of people were
like oh pull that collar i don't know about this one

4868
05:21:55,800 --> 05:21:56,260
But...

4869
05:21:56,260 --> 05:21:57,140
Yeah.

4870
05:22:01,360 --> 05:22:02,700
Have you guys seen that?

4871
05:22:03,000 --> 05:22:03,540
You know what?

4872
05:22:03,660 --> 05:22:06,720
It's kind of funny because before...

4873
05:22:08,600 --> 05:22:11,720
Before Silent Hill 2 remake, I don't think...

4874
05:22:11,720 --> 05:22:13,440
Because I heard so many good things about it.

4875
05:22:13,520 --> 05:22:14,660
Obviously, I haven't played it myself.

4876
05:22:15,020 --> 05:22:19,160
But before that, I wouldn't have been excited about a new
Bluebird team game.

4877
05:22:19,840 --> 05:22:22,060
But did you see that they were teasing something?

4878
05:22:22,720 --> 05:22:27,720
A lot of people think it's Rule of Rose, which would be very
interesting if it is.

4879
05:22:29,720 --> 05:22:30,920
Very, very interesting.

4880
05:22:38,660 --> 05:22:39,980
Rule of Rose is wild.

4881
05:22:40,700 --> 05:22:43,280
It would be quite...

4882
05:22:43,280 --> 05:22:43,800
You know what, though?

4883
05:22:44,220 --> 05:22:48,380
I often confuse elements of Rule of Rose and Haunting
Ground.

4884
05:22:48,600 --> 05:22:49,320
Like, they're so...

4885
05:22:49,320 --> 05:22:50,620
Because there's, like, the dog.

4886
05:22:50,780 --> 05:22:53,280
Like, sometimes I'll be like, oh, yeah, that's monster.

4887
05:22:53,420 --> 05:22:55,520
And I'll be like, no, that's Haunting Ground, not Rule of
Rose.

4888
05:22:56,200 --> 05:22:56,560
Hmm.

4889
05:23:02,260 --> 05:23:08,380
both feature a girl with a dog they're remaking the first
silent hill aren't they they did announce that they were

4890
05:23:08,380 --> 05:23:15,580
doing that so but i don't i don't know if that's i wonder if
they would do a countdown for especially like it was like a

4891
05:23:15,580 --> 05:23:26,840
17 day countdown for the remake of silent hill one something
that they've already announced i feel like they i feel like

4892
05:23:26,840 --> 05:23:42,700
either a new uh i think it's a new property or something
content ground is called demento in japanese whoa i didn't

4893
05:23:42,700 --> 05:23:55,740
know that actually i didn't know that they're making
something with nintendo too oh really oh you know what oh my

4894
05:23:55,740 --> 05:24:03,440
gosh please eternal darkness remake you know what i would i
would do it i would I would play it all over again.

4895
05:24:04,700 --> 05:24:07,720
I mean, I have to play it again to get the other ending, so.

4896
05:24:13,770 --> 05:24:18,330
Because imagine, like, the sanity effects they could do,
like, modern day.

4897
05:24:20,030 --> 05:24:21,310
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

4898
05:24:30,110 --> 05:24:30,630
Parodius.

4899
05:24:32,770 --> 05:24:34,230
Yeah, it'd be pretty fun.

4900
05:24:35,150 --> 05:24:36,230
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

4901
05:24:37,670 --> 05:24:38,930
Peace Walker Portal.

4902
05:24:38,950 --> 05:24:39,650
on Switch?

4903
05:24:40,850 --> 05:24:42,130
We gotta get...

4904
05:24:42,130 --> 05:24:46,870
I think, well, definitely Master Collection Part 2 will have
Peace Walker port, for sure.

4905
05:24:47,570 --> 05:24:48,410
They can't not.

4906
05:24:49,130 --> 05:24:50,070
House have Peace Walker.

4907
05:24:51,930 --> 05:24:53,630
And hopefully 4.

4908
05:24:53,830 --> 05:24:54,990
Hopefully that's what we're waiting on.

4909
05:24:58,730 --> 05:25:00,170
Opens up your system file.

4910
05:25:00,290 --> 05:25:00,750
Oh my gosh.

4911
05:25:01,030 --> 05:25:02,070
People will play...

4912
05:25:02,070 --> 05:25:02,550
Oh no.

4913
05:25:03,570 --> 05:25:12,910
People will play Eternal Darkness if it got remade and be
like, Is this Doki Doki Literature Club...

4914
05:25:15,070 --> 05:25:19,070
Is this Doki Doki Literature Club RPG?

4915
05:25:29,240 --> 05:25:33,040
No, no, don't say that.

4916
05:25:35,120 --> 05:25:35,420
Oh.

4917
05:25:40,740 --> 05:25:43,240
Who even owns the Eternal Darkness IP?

4918
05:25:45,000 --> 05:25:46,180
It's a great question.

4919
05:25:46,620 --> 05:25:50,020
I know the sanity thing is copyrighted, so that's why it's
like...

4920
05:25:52,900 --> 05:25:54,060
Will you play the final?

4921
05:25:54,120 --> 05:25:54,720
Oh, final.

4922
05:25:54,920 --> 05:25:55,260
Oh my gosh.

4923
05:25:55,580 --> 05:25:57,180
Fatal Frame 2 remake.

4924
05:25:57,440 --> 05:25:57,920
Absolutely.

4925
05:25:58,120 --> 05:25:58,640
Yes, I will.

4926
05:25:59,620 --> 05:26:00,400
Yes, yes, yes.

4927
05:26:02,620 --> 05:26:03,640
Yes, yes, yes.

4928
05:26:06,840 --> 05:26:09,280
First horror game was Doki Doki Literature Club.

4929
05:26:09,480 --> 05:26:09,960
I know.

4930
05:26:10,200 --> 05:26:10,680
I know.

4931
05:26:13,520 --> 05:26:14,000
Final.

4932
05:26:14,020 --> 05:26:20,400
frame you oh nintendo does own it okay okay

4933
05:26:26,920 --> 05:26:35,840
fatal frame is called project zero in the eu for some reason
i think that's because it's closer to the to the uh japanese

4934
05:26:35,840 --> 05:26:44,260
name but maybe sometimes they do that because like it's too
close i i wonder if like project zero is too close to

4935
05:26:44,260 --> 05:26:45,160
another copyright

4936
05:26:49,400 --> 05:26:57,900
or it could be that they were like oh project zero doesn't i
don't know sometimes they just change things to kind of feel

4937
05:26:57,900 --> 05:27:12,860
like it'll appeal to more people yeah like resident evil
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah biohazard biohazard

4938
05:27:12,860 --> 05:27:20,860
i don't know i i feel like the name resident evil is so
Like, I can't think of another...

4939
05:27:20,860 --> 05:27:22,900
You know, I couldn't think of it as a biohazard.

4940
05:27:34,790 --> 05:27:35,890
It made a name for itself.

4941
05:27:40,670 --> 05:27:41,550
Resident Evil.

4942
05:27:42,670 --> 05:27:44,870
I always think of, like...

4943
05:27:44,870 --> 05:27:46,950
No, I think of...

4944
05:27:46,950 --> 05:27:48,750
I'm kind of thinking...

4945
05:27:48,750 --> 05:27:52,930
I'm saying Resident Evil with, like, the House of the
Dead...

4946
05:27:52,930 --> 05:27:55,270
Like, the guy that says House of the Dead on the...

4947
05:27:56,750 --> 05:27:57,370
What's the word?

4948
05:27:58,870 --> 05:27:59,730
The Arcade.

4949
05:27:59,830 --> 05:28:13,550
game when it goes house of the dead i think resident evil
you know but it's so iconic house of the dead these games

4950
05:28:13,550 --> 05:28:23,690
are so fine resident evil used to have that too oh it did
maybe that's why i'm thinking of it also that's how they say

4951
05:28:23,690 --> 05:28:35,890
it in the games too oh maybe i am thinking of it then
resident of the house of House of the Evil Dead Residents.

4952
05:28:40,670 --> 05:28:42,930
Very memorable title screens.

4953
05:28:43,330 --> 05:28:44,350
Bring them back.

4954
05:28:45,350 --> 05:28:46,490
Bring them back.

4955
05:28:48,410 --> 05:28:51,030
Another one that I like to say is on the 3D...

4956
05:28:51,030 --> 05:28:51,530
Not 3D.

4957
05:28:51,830 --> 05:28:52,550
On the...

4958
05:28:52,550 --> 05:28:53,330
Yeah, 3DS.

4959
05:28:53,990 --> 05:28:56,470
Was it Rune Factory 4?

4960
05:28:59,470 --> 05:29:00,950
An old roommate.

4961
05:29:01,390 --> 05:29:08,090
I had it on the 3DS and so they would just be like, Rude
Factory 4.

4962
05:29:19,240 --> 05:29:20,980
I'm sure you already brought this up.

4963
05:29:21,160 --> 05:29:22,540
I'm sure somebody already brought this up.

4964
05:29:22,960 --> 05:29:24,980
I don't know if you'll play it, but did you see the
potentially...

4965
05:29:24,980 --> 05:29:28,400
Yeah, the Solid Snake and Rainbow Six Siege I did.

4966
05:29:29,100 --> 05:29:30,580
The trailer was pretty cool.

4967
05:29:30,720 --> 05:29:38,820
Having the codec come up, specifically MGS2 codec, and then
like the smoke all around him, it looked really good.

4968
05:29:40,540 --> 05:29:42,180
It looks pretty cool.

4969
05:29:43,800 --> 05:29:45,180
But I've never played that game.

4970
05:29:45,420 --> 05:29:46,880
It's like just a shooter, isn't it?

4971
05:29:49,200 --> 05:29:50,240
It's just...

4972
05:29:50,240 --> 05:29:53,700
You know, I was able...

4973
05:29:53,700 --> 05:29:56,560
I was tempted to get the...

4974
05:29:58,780 --> 05:30:00,400
Like, I was tempted...

4975
05:30:00,400 --> 05:30:03,480
Rather, I was convinced to get the Fortnite skins.

4976
05:30:04,160 --> 05:30:05,780
But I don't know if I'll do this.

4977
05:30:10,260 --> 05:30:25,380
you would be in hell I'd be like Anu Ectol please be nice to
me I may be like Shut up Shut up stupid baby Except they

4978
05:30:25,380 --> 05:30:28,340
would Say something Much worse to me

4979
05:30:31,780 --> 05:30:37,240
It would be Something I would have to beat maybe

4980
05:30:42,170 --> 05:30:45,530
Something I would have to Something I would have to censor
from the stream.

4981
05:30:46,710 --> 05:30:50,470
Unless I get to my channel, take it away from me.

4982
05:30:52,630 --> 05:30:56,010
Game has issue with players vote kicking for no reason.

4983
05:30:56,650 --> 05:30:58,970
They're just, you're just, no, it's the vibes.

4984
05:30:59,090 --> 05:30:59,710
It's the vibes.

4985
05:31:00,170 --> 05:31:01,610
You don't pass the vibe check.

4986
05:31:04,150 --> 05:31:06,730
Resident Evil is to me like MGSSCO.

4987
05:31:06,870 --> 05:31:08,390
It's my biggest special interest of all time.

4988
05:31:08,530 --> 05:31:11,270
If you need a place to start Resident Evil 2, remake is the
best.

4989
05:31:11,750 --> 05:31:12,630
Thank you!

4990
05:31:13,930 --> 05:31:21,470
I have been wanting to start the Resident Evil journey
lately.

4991
05:31:22,830 --> 05:31:24,850
There's just too many series that I want to do.

4992
05:31:27,090 --> 05:31:28,330
Not enough time.

4993
05:31:32,470 --> 05:31:35,930
I feel like I need to like...

4994
05:31:35,930 --> 05:31:42,970
Do like, okay guys, we're starting this series, the game,
whole week.

4995
05:31:43,330 --> 05:31:43,950
But it's hard.

4996
05:31:46,530 --> 05:31:48,690
the first world problems.

4997
05:31:48,830 --> 05:31:49,390
I know.

4998
05:31:51,510 --> 05:31:52,050
I know.

4999
05:32:05,900 --> 05:32:09,140
And with you, I'm winning an eternal darkness remaster, a
good remake.

5000
05:32:09,300 --> 05:32:11,900
I love that game to death and it's been horribly neglected.

5001
05:32:12,660 --> 05:32:13,220
It just sucks.

5002
05:32:13,320 --> 05:32:14,580
It's stuck on the GameCube.

5003
05:32:15,620 --> 05:32:18,860
You know, like...

5004
05:32:19,840 --> 05:32:23,300
That's the worst feeling is when a game is stuck on an old
console.

5005
05:32:30,330 --> 05:32:31,090
Dark Souls?

5006
05:32:37,050 --> 05:32:41,630
I've already saw Ace Combat ahead of you, and it's crazy how
cool the games feel from the very first one.

5007
05:32:41,730 --> 05:32:51,310
I think, I don't know, I'm very, like, with my schedule how
it is, I'm so, like, when do I get to Ace Combat?

5008
05:32:52,690 --> 05:32:54,930
And also, even before Ace Combat 8.

5009
05:33:02,780 --> 05:33:03,740
Vicky for help.

5010
05:33:04,780 --> 05:33:05,680
What on Dark Souls?

5011
05:33:05,920 --> 05:33:10,800
We did think about doing a Night Reign, Densetsu, Trio.

5012
05:33:20,240 --> 05:33:22,100
Too many good games.

5013
05:33:22,340 --> 05:33:23,620
I know, I know.

5014
05:33:26,820 --> 05:33:27,720
That would be chaos.

5015
05:33:27,880 --> 05:33:28,980
That'd be hilarious.

5016
05:33:30,440 --> 05:33:35,340
Two very differing thoughts on the matter.

5017
05:33:37,240 --> 05:33:39,120
Nah, I don't know the...

5018
05:33:41,120 --> 05:33:45,400
stories are so different you can play eight without
finishing the others it won't matter i know but like by

5019
05:33:45,400 --> 05:33:55,640
principle i've i've been collecting them so that i can play

5020
05:33:55,640 --> 05:34:03,000

the beginning because obviously it's been a really long time

5021
05:34:03,000 --> 05:34:10,240
since i played seven i thought about even going back in my
free time and just kind of getting back into the controls of

05:34:10,240 --> 05:34:26,020
it the dog fighting of it all um so yeah re7 no no sorry not

Oh, there's you.

5041
05:36:04,200 --> 05:36:04,360
Okay.

5042
05:36:07,600 --> 05:36:07,920
Woo!

5043
05:36:08,860 --> 05:36:10,340
Thanks for all the cute noises, Minto.

5044
05:36:10,740 --> 05:36:11,400
What did I do?

5045
05:36:11,700 --> 05:36:12,280
What noises?

5046
05:36:13,240 --> 05:36:15,600
Minto ended the stream and smiled in triumph.

5047
05:36:15,840 --> 05:36:17,680
No more Alan bad knees.

5048
05:36:18,000 --> 05:36:22,260
No more taken with their ambushes and with fart-sounding
axes.

5049
05:36:23,660 --> 05:36:25,700
Why did they suddenly start sounding like that?

5050
05:36:26,000 --> 05:36:29,060
But the game done, Minto, was left to write out the rest of
her night.

5051
05:36:29,540 --> 05:36:31,880
And she wrote herself a fantastic one.

5052
05:36:32,280 --> 05:36:32,520
Aww!

5053
05:36:33,660 --> 05:36:35,340
All the well, that ends well, huh?

5054
05:36:35,600 --> 05:36:37,040
Thanks again for playing Alan Wake, Minto.

5055
05:36:37,220 --> 05:36:37,660
Thank you!

5056
05:36:38,040 --> 05:36:38,760
Thanks for watching.

5057
05:36:39,240 --> 05:36:39,720
Good playthrough.

5058
05:36:39,980 --> 05:36:41,300
Oh, thank you!

5059
05:36:43,440 --> 05:36:45,400
Did you ever end up reaching out to Maddie?

5060
05:36:45,840 --> 05:36:46,880
I should, I should.

5061
05:36:47,120 --> 05:36:48,380
It's been so long since I've talked to her.

5062
05:36:49,380 --> 05:36:50,240
I just want to say hi.

5063
05:36:51,040 --> 05:36:51,720
That I love her.

5064
05:36:51,860 --> 05:36:58,520
She drew some really funny comics recently with Caitlin from
Final Fantasy VII.

5065
05:36:59,840 --> 05:37:01,600
Kate Sith for some of you guys.

5066
05:37:02,180 --> 05:37:03,920
I call him Caitlin because it's cuter.

5067
05:37:04,440 --> 05:37:05,300
Anyway, they're really funny.

5068
05:37:06,720 --> 05:37:07,780
Oh, it's you.

5069
05:37:08,460 --> 05:37:09,160
It's a meet now.

5070
05:37:09,620 --> 05:37:10,540
Thank you, everybody.

5071
05:37:11,160 --> 05:37:11,520
Have a good day.

5072
05:37:11,600 --> 05:37:12,000
Have a good night.

5073
05:37:12,100 --> 05:37:13,480
Have a good time zone.

5074
05:37:13,940 --> 05:37:14,680
Have a good time zone.

5075
05:37:15,840 --> 05:37:17,020
I will see you when I see you next.

5076
05:37:17,600 --> 05:37:19,000
We're doing FNB tomorrow.

5077
05:37:19,180 --> 05:37:19,980
I'm so excited.

5078
05:37:20,120 --> 05:37:20,720
I'm so excited.

5079
05:37:23,000 --> 05:37:24,540
Watch out, out, out, out, out, out.

5080
05:37:25,120 --> 05:37:26,400
Eat out, out.

5081
05:37:26,620 --> 05:37:26,980
Bye.
