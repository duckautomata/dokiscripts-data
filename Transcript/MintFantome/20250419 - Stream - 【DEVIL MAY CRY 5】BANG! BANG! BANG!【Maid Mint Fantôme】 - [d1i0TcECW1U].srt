00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,770
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,910
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

3
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,390
Welcome to Devil May Cry 5.

4
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,670
Five.

5
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,130
We're here.

6
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,110
Devil May Cry 5.

7
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,070
We've been through... What?

8
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,630
Through four?

9
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,530
Including two?

10
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,830
We've been through the whole journey.

11
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:51,810
Whoa.

12
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,410
Casey.

13
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,830
Oh my gosh.

14
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,650
Thank you for the HakuSupa.

15
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,310
What?

16
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,490
No spoilers, but there are a few things that your Metal Gear brain will latch onto.

17
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,150
Now I'm motivated.

18
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,690
That's so funny.

19
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,690
I almost asked.

20
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,370
I was almost going to be like...

21
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,390
Hey guys, should I buy any of the DLC?

22
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,070
There's like DLC on Steam for this game.

23
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,290
Wait, hold on.

24
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,650
Let me see.

25
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,830
View all in store.

26
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,290
Like there's bananas.

27
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,850
I kinda want that.

28
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,290
I kinda want the bananas.

29
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,010
Maybe I shouldn't look at this though.

30
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,770
I like how you can still buy Rorbs and Blorbs though.

31
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,510
That's pretty funny.

32
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,910
Maybe make you never cry.

33
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,250
Thanks, Golden Foxy!

34
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,990
Thank you.

35
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,730
You can get it later.

36
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,090
Yeah, I think we'll... I think we'll... Maybe a second... Next... Next time I play.

37
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,350
Hope you enjoy DMC5.

38
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,050
It will be peak.

39
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,410
Love you.

40
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,310
Thank you, Leto!

41
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,290
Thank you.

42
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,590
Minto tags.

43
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,930
There is no such thing.

44
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,890
DMC3 has lots of very cool cutscene live action and behind the scene motion capture content.

45
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,990
Ooh, I like... I actually really like motion capture content.

46
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,490
It's something I've always wanted to do is like be a... Motion capture... Actor?

47
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,530
So that part of... Stuff really interests me.

48
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,350
So thank you!

49
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,330
Oh, did you guys watch W3?

50
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,570
Did you guys watch... Here.

51
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,730
Actually, I'm gonna link it.

52
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,910
One second.

53
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,290
Yes?

54
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,550
It's a little different from the first two.

55
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,990
I hope you guys don't mind... Hold on.

56
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,730
I don't want it to play though.

57
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,030
Wait.

58
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,610
Shut up.

59
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:51,970
Shut up.

60
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,090
There we go.

61
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,410
Okay.

62
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,350

Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes.

176
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,220
Good vibes.

177
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,220
Yeah, let me also say... No spoilers, because this is my first time playing.

178
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,440
And... If you're here for good gameplay, don't watch VTubers.

179
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,380
Or like 90% of VTubers.

180
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,960
Yeah.

181
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh, that's my... That's my opening statement.

182
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm here for cute ghostmates.

183
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,780
If you want... If you want silly...

184
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,160
Then you're in the right place, maybe.

185
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,140
I was talking with a friend earlier.

186
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,400
And I was just like, you know...

187
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Obviously, there's one thing to really watch someone be good at a game.

188
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,540
Like some people who are like...

189
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Able to play games blindfolded.

190
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,000
But then at the same time...

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
You know, you don't...

192
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,860
I mean...

193
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,020
If someone's... It depends.

194
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,180
It depends on how someone plays their game.

195
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,720
Like...

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,400
I... Sorry.

197
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,100
I talk about Big Saru all the time.

198
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,680
Because I'm obsessed with his channel.

199
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,720
But he's...

200
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
Uh...

201
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,760
He's a...

202
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:39,880
He's a...

203
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,660
A Metal Gear...

204
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,420
Player.

205
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,540
I was not wed to you.

206
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,940
But...

207
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
He also is so good at the game that he...

208
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,180
Like messes around a lot and does silly things.

209
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,080
So there's like people that are really good at games and are able...

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,340
Are so good that they can do silly things and get away with it.

211
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,440
But then there's also like...

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
People that are taking games so seriously.

213
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,860
They're so serious.

214
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,960
They're so...

215
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,040
They're so serious about how people play.

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Spoilers.

217
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,060
Everyone is hot.

218
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Thank you guys for the super time.

219
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,760
Thank you.

220
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,960
Yeah.

221
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,380
Come for the silly.

222
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,440
Stay for the freaky.

223
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,840
Woo!

224
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,040
Oh yeah.

225
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,960
So...

226
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,640
But I like...

227
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,060
You know...

228
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,240
Even if I'm not...

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,080
Good at the game.

230
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,120
I can at least...

231
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,140
You can maybe get a chuckle out of...

232
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,300
Out of some of the gameplay.

233
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,220
So...

234
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,760
The...

235
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,020
What I'm trying to say is...

236
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,620
Don't take things so seriously.

237
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,640
That's me being the...

238
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,160
Joker.

239
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,940
Why so serious?

240
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,140
Why so serious?

241
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,860
Will you watch the recap?

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,520
There's a recap?

243
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,940
Is it the history of DMC?

244
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,980
Is that like...

245
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,680
Because last time it was a bunch of text.

246
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,160
In the...

247
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,980
In DMC4.

248
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,380
So...

249
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,260
And I couldn't keep up reading it.

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,820
I was like...

251
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,400
I was a rap god.

252
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,920
It's a video this time.

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,500
Watch a movie that explains the history.

254
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,960
Yes.

255
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,100
I would love to watch this.

256
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,620
Thank you guys for all the...

257
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:19,880
Donuts.

258
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,460
We're for a drinker.

259
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,780
Welcome to DMC5.

260
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,120
Congrats on making it at this point.

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,780
Thank you.

262
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,180
All the moves, fights, stingers, blurbs, uphills, downhills.

263
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,540
I've led you to this point.

264
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,140
Hope you enjoy this crazy game.

265
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,520
Yeah!

266
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm so excited.

267
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,060
People have always been like...

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Um...

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Have always been like...

270
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,200
Five is...

271
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,560
Five is where it's...

272
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,280
All...

273
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,000
Cumulates.

274
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,160
It's all...

275
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,800
It's all leads up to five.

276
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,660
Which I mean...

277
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,640
That's how games...

278
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,660
That's how series work.

279
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,480
But also...

280
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,740
That five is like the best.

281
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,160
Medium difficulty is always the intended experience by the devs.

282
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,900
F the haters.

283
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,640
Ah!

284
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,080
I didn't pick human.

285
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,400
I picked Devil Hunter.

286
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
That's the same as four.

287
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,880
So...

288
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,180
That's what I did last time.

289
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,240
Mm-hmm-hmm.

290
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,760
First time live, viewer!

291
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,100
Woo!

292
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Thank you!

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
And thank you for the super chat.

294
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
I really appreciate it.

295
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,120
He said he made this for the fans.

296
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
That he was confident it will exceed all expectations.

297
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,860
Whoa!

298
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,460
Okay.

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm going in with big expectations!

300
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,160
I'm going in with big expectations.

301
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
But before we start, let's watch the movie.

302
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,540
To get a little bit of a recap.

303
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,800
Happy.

304
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,980
Long ago.

305
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,300
A single demon challenged the Emperor of the Underworld for the sake of mankind.

306
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,260
The demon would prove victorious and seal off the Underworld.

307
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,000
Dark Knight.

308
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,300
Oh my gosh, and I'm the Joker.

309
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,040
That demon was the Dark Knight Sparta!

310
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,860
Yeah, that guy.

311
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,680
Sparta's legend spread, and the legendary Dark Knight was revered by mankind.

312
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,900
But as the years slipped by, the memory of his deeds and the existence of demons faded from memory.

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,060
After 2,000 years, the seal on the Underworld began to weaken.

314
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,600
The demon Emperor Mundus sent his minions after Sparta's wife and twin sons...

315
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, in an act of something.

316
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,260
Sorry.

317
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Sparta's human wife, Eva...

318
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,100
No chance against the demons and lost her life.

319
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,980
One of Sparta's sons, Virgil, went missing.

320
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,720
The only survivor was Dante.

321
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,300
Virgil's twin brother.

322
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,840
Decades later.

323
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,320
Oh.

324
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,620
Dante was reunited with his lost brother, Virgil.

325
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:30,800
Oh.

326
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
Virgil survived.

327
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,890
Oh, sorry.

328
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,550
I was supposed to be read.

329
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,510
He got Yamato.

330
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:49,050
Arkham, a man bent on obtaining demonic power, knew that unlocking Sparta's power would weaken the seal on the Underworld!

331
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,430
To this end, Arkham manipulated Virgil from the shadows to fulfill his saluted ambitions.

332
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,430
Conflicted over his feelings for his lost brother, Dante set out to stop Virgil and Arkham.

333
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,930
Along the way, Dante met a demon under the name of the lady!

334
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,650
Her lust for revenge!

335
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,030
You can't say lust for revenge.

336
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,290
Woo!

337
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,820
Sorry.

338
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,460
The battle between brothers was fierce, but Virgil met his match.

339
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,120
In the end, he refused Dante's help as he fell alone into the Underworld.

340
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,960
Soon after, Dante opened his shop for business.

341
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Devil may cry!

342
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,240
Frunting as a local handyman, he used his business to hunt down demons and collect information on...

343
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Was it Mundus?

344
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Is that what he said?

345
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,740
Sometime later, a mysterious and beautiful woman appeared at Dante's door.

346
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,900
The woman's name was Trish, and she bore a striking resemblance to Dante's deceased mother!

347
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,180
Now we're on Devil May Cry.

348
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,440
She led Dante to Mallet Island, where Mundus had been sealed away.

349
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,280
Away!

350
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,660
There, Dante faced a gauntlet of Mundus' minions, all of whom who fell the...

351
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh, sorry.

352
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,160
One such adversary was revealed to be Virgil, warped into the demon known as Nilo Angelo!

353
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,120
In the face of Mundus' cruelty, Dante's anger erupted like never before!

354
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,340
The true power Dante inherited from his father Sparta was unleashed, which he used to seal Mundus away once again!

355
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Why?

356
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,580
Wait!

357
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,600
Is this the anime?

358
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,320
Many demons continued to invade the human world.

359
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,980
But not even demonic rulers rivaling the power of Mundus could match Dante.

360
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,980
Always at peace in the human world.

361
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,940
Yeah, the original, right?

362
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,360
But not for long!

363
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,660
Devil May Cry 4!

364
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,560
A Sparta worshipping cult known as the Order of the Sword.

365
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,780
Oh, it's so bad.

366
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Those Dante trolls...

367
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,380
Thank you, Sparta!

368
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,180
Oh, wow.

369
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,820
So...

370
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,040
What is this remix?

371
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,220
You came to die!

372
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,760
Wait, this is so good!

373
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,360
Nero learned of the Order's true goals during his pursuit of Dante and was killed...

374
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,700
Wait, oh, sorry.

375
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,600
Unbeknownst to all, Virgil's sword Yamato has been in the Order's possession.

376
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,840
The blade resonated with Nero, arriving here with new demonic powers!

377
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
This is proof enough that the blood of Sparta coursed through Nero's veins as well.

378
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,680
Having learned of the Order's sinister plans, Nero confronted...

379
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,580
A fellow Holy Knight and Mentor credit card with his involvement.

380
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,340
But alas, his former mentor had been working towards the Order's goals all along!

381
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,480
On top of everything, Sanctus was revived with the aid of nefarious powers.

382
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,560
Nero's beloved Chidiae was taken hostage!

383
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,640
My sister, wife, and the lovers were absorbed into the core of the Order's ultimate weapon.

384
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
The savior!

385
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,640
Enraged over his sister, Chidiae's treatment, Credo tried to save Nero, only to be dealt a fatal blow at the hand of Sanctus!

386
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
Not the rule!

387
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,740
And we were all satisfied.

388
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Nero was then able to defeat Sanctus and put an end to the Order's evil...

389
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,860
Uh, something... something's happened.

390
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Dante sensed in Nero the same connection to Sparta's power, and so entrusted Yamato to the youth before leaving Fortuna.

391
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,960
The two parted ways and continued their fight against demons in defense of the human world.

392
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,920
The two descendants of Sparta kept the world safe, and at peace for many years.

393
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,180
But nothing lasts forever.

394
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,740
And a crisis looms on the horizon, the likes of which their world has never seen.

395
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,180
And they just...

396
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,600
They just completely be like...

397
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,900
Two?

398
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
Uh, never heard of her.

399
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200
Yay!

400
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,780
Oh, yeah!

401
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,540
One...

402
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
Three, four!

403
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,560
And they showed more of...

404
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,420
Of the anime than they did of two.

405
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,420
The real question is, are you going to watch the live-action cutscenes at the DLC?

406
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,720
Uh, maybe.

407
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,460
I want to play the game first, though.

408
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,040
Thanks for the nice read-through.

409
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,120
I did my best.

410
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,420
Fronting is a handyman.

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
He should've...

412
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,660
More like Fronting-ass Pizza Man.

413
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
That guy didn't...

414
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,520
That guy doesn't...

415
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,980
Probably has never held a wrench before.

416
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,180
It's like, you guys...

417
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,000
You say...

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,660
You're like, hey, Dante, can you give me the Allen wrench?

419
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,620
And he's like, Allen who?

420
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,940
I don't know that guy.

421
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,570
Two got the portable ops treatment.

422
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,210
Wow!

423
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,170
Good...

424
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,250
Good, uh, recap of everything.

425
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,010
And now...

426
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,830
We're on to...

427
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,170
Five!

428
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,150
The...

429
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,650
The...

430
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,890
Quote-unquote final game.

431
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,070
Um, I have lots of people asking if I will play...

432
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,990
Like, DMC, Devil May Cry.

433
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,090
Um, just so that I don't keep...

434
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,350
Resp...

435
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,190
Uh, uh...

436
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,030
Answering the question over and over again.

437
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,450
I'm still deciding.

438
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,510
I don't know yet if I will or not.

439
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,950
Just because...

440
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,490
Um...

441
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,830
I don't know yet.

442
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,210
So...

443
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,870
Yeah.

444
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,230
That's just...

445
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,010
I don't know yet.

446
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,650
That's all.

447
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,570
Anyway.

448
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,170
Oh my god.

449
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,650
Obviously, I guess...

450
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,010
V.

451
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,180
Interesting.

452
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,220
Fun.

453
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,540
There's three characters now!

454
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,120
Oh.

455
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,380
There was...

456
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,960
At once a demon who saved the human world from destruction...

457
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
I can't read anything in this game.

458
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
And it grew both day and night...

459
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,480
Till it bore an apple bride.

460
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,120
V has come too!

461
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,300
Whoa!

462
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,260
That was really triggering my trepophobia.

463
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,340
This thing's nasty.

464
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,940
Big ol' pomegranate.

465
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm that guy with his hand on his hips.

466
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,020
He's like...

467
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,100
Well, that's peculiar.

468
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,750
Whoa!

469
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,220
Oh, I forgot to say too, you guys.

470
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,140
May 16th!

471
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,780
It's almost that day!

472
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Oh my gosh!

473
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,340
Wait, why didn't you guys tell me this took place on May 16th?

474
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,560
I would have started it then.

475
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,000
We've known each other a long time.

476
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,480
Uh-oh.

477
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,360
There's no subtitles.

478
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,940
You never had this much trouble.

479
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,120
Senpai, happy birthday!

480
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,540
You're gonna make it through this, Dante.

481
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,640
Ah!

482
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,580
Dante!

483
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,540
He's so old!

484
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,120
Jack Frost!

485
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,900
What am I doing, wasting my time here?

486
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,980
He's got this!

487
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,500
Oh, he's got a haircut!

488
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,220
Vero!

489
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,480
You should not underestimate this demon.

490
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,560
Mysterious!

491
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,740
After all, it was he who took your right arm.

492
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,080
And gained a great deal of power from it.

493
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,860
I'm leaving.

494
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,460
I suggest you do not fall behind.

495
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Not to...

496
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,680
What the hell?

497
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay, Fae.

498
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,540
You're an interesting guy, but you're right.

499
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,160
He's just skating away.

500
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm a freak.

501
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,520
I've got a score to settle with that son of a bitch.

502
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
We're like so media ray.

503
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,020
Oh my god.

504
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,720
Whoa.

505
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh, wow.

506
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,360
Wait, is there a way I can turn on subtitles?

507
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,980
Oh, my arm!

508
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,640
Wait, Nira, what happened to you?

509
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,500
What a...

510
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,240
So much has...

511
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,260
So much has happened.

512
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:36,860
Hold on.

513
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,320
Okay.

514
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,020
Wait, let me go to options first and turn on...

515
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm guessing it's under language.

516
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,060
Subtitles.

517
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,480
Yes.

518
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,200
Thank you.

519
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,760
Okay.

520
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,600
Wait, I also saw that there was Japanese, but it actually won't let me change it.

521
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
It's just kind of interesting.

522
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm not left-handed.

523
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,310
Oh, look, there's like a whole melee attack, gun attack.

524
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,830
Okay, it's all unused.

525
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,990
Why is B unused?

526
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,270
Unused.

527
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,210
Jump.

528
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,010
Change.

529
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:12,950
Lock on.

530
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,490
Unused?

531
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,550
The D-pad's unused?

532
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,430
For now.

533
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:16,990
Maybe.

534
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,950
Lock on.

535
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,430
Yo.

536
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,130
Whoa!

537
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,330
Jeff, thank you so much for the...

538
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh, thank you.

539
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,670
Also, I'm sorry.

540
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,010
Let me sing happy birthday before we...

541
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,790
Happy birthday to you.

542
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,750
Happy birthday to you.

543
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,430
Happy birthday to Simbad.

544
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,050
Happy birthday to you.

545
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,010
Happy birthday!

546
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,670
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,290
We're just so in the middle of this right now.

548
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,830
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,110
Okay.

550
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:52,950
Exceed.

551
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,050
Taunt.

552
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,150
Are those my Blorbs and my Rorbs?

554
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,370
The Rorbs look hideous.

555
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,850
Okay.

556
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,710
Kai?

557
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,650
Dante.

558
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:15,750
Dante.

559
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,610
Oh!

560
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,990
Oh, there's...

561
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,830
Some people said he looks like Kylo Ren.

562
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,550
I see it, though.

563
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,190
Yeah?

564
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:24,870
Oh!

565
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,050
It's a...

566
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,690
Jump.

567
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,990
Okay.

568
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,730
All right.

569
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,390
I'm keeping up.

570
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:31,750
Oh!

571
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,350
Where the...

572
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,330
I'm not keeping up.

573
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:33,850
Just kidding.

574
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,550
I lied.

575
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,990
Oh, raspberry!

576
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,390
Oh!

577
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:41,870
Oh!

578
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,580
Em...

579
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,200
Pew shot!

580
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Pew shot!

581
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,000
When a barrier blocks off your path...

582
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,300
Yep, yep.

583
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,780
I know that.

584
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,500
The seals...

585
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,420
I can take you with no arms.

586
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,080
Ho-ho!

587
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,860
Wait.

588
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,560
Nice.

589
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,840
I have, like, no...

590
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,180
Oh!

591
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh!

592
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Oh!

593
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,700
Oh, it's so ugly!

594
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,260
A lot of references to DMC Devil May Cry in file.

595
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,120
Oh, well...

596
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,460
That's okay.

597
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,110
Oh, there's more!

598
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,390
Okay.

599
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,670
Oh.

600
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,290
Wait.

601
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,950
What did it say?

602
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,790
Oh, change lock-on.

603
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,390
That's...

604
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,770
Yeah, I know.

605
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,450
Yeah, that's okay.

606
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,810
Oh, it's so stylized.

607
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,450
The game is loud?

608
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,690
I'll turn it down.

609
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,730
It's so stylized!

610
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,190
Everything is...

611
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,610
Wow!

612
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,850
Wow-wee!

613
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,550
Oh, this way.

614
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,590
I guess...

615
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,530
I trust you.

616
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,840
I thought the audio was fine.

617
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
I can turn it up just a little bit.

618
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,320
I'll put it in between, but I just had it.

619
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,100
These things are so nasty!

620
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,940
Everything's so HD and so good-looking.

621
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,740
Ah!

622
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,140
Eww!

623
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,420
Eww!

624
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,720
Oh, my God!

625
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,080
High roller.

626
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,060
You have a number of special moves.

627
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,860
Okay, yeah.

628
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,160
Hold down Y to follow them into the air.

629
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:43,980
Neat.

630
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,720
Hold X until you're...

631
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,020
Oh...

632
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, okay, okay.

633
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,600
We have that.

634
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

635
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,220
Color up.

636
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,480
Okay.

637
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,560
Ravens helping each other out.

638
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,160
What's the world coming to?

639
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,180
Hi-ya-yah-yah.

640
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,380
Young-yah.

641
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,820
Wait, hold on.

642
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,700
Out of the way!

643
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,140
Oh, wait.

644
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,100
Oh, I forgot to hold Y.

645
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,080
There we go.

646
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,100
Yeah, badass!

647
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,620
Oh!

648
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,300
Eww!

649
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,940
Everything looks so gross!

650
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,520
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!

651
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,800
I just barely missed him.

652
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,520
Come here!

653
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,640
Come here!

654
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh yeah.

655
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,480
Oh yeah, hold on.

656
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,840
Hold X.

657
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm holding.

658
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,620
Is that it?

659
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,820
Oh!

660
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,180
RE Engine for TMZ5.

661
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
Nerissa's in this game.

662
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,440
Come on with your bad self.

663
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,650
Okay.

664
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,390
Whoa.

665
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,810
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

666
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,830
What the hell?

667
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,990
I was just looking around.

668
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,230
I didn't think that we would get a full shot of...

669
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,330
Oh!

670
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,370
Come here!

671
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,650
Oops, I meant up.

672
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,150
Come here, come here.

673
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:38,970
Dismal.

674
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,790
Oh, villain!

675
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,430
Oh my gosh!

676
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,970
What's up with all the Argo Superbuzz?

677
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,090
I wasn't able to beat all five games.

678
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,090
That's okay, why would you apologize?

679
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,650
But thank you!

680
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,390
Managed to beat DMZ3 with Royal Guard only in honor of your Royal Guardless DMZ.

681
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,050
All right, although the final boss took me almost an hour.

682
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:01,890
Oh my gosh!

683
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,810
Yeah, your motivation.

684
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,170
Do these have things?

685
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:07,630
Come here.

686
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,570
Whoa...

687
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,510
Whoa...

688
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,470
Starring the DMZ crew.

689
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,250
Where's your motivation?

690
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,210
Nope, nevermind.

691
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,330
It's kinda weird that you, like, absorb the Rorbs immediately.

692
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,290
I like destroying these.

693
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,150
More nasally?

694
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,590
Oh, sorry.

695
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,380
Nasty!

696
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,840
I don't think I'm getting anything from these, but it's still fun.

697
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,960
I don't know.

698
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,120
This guy's so cool!

699
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,020
He looks like, almost like he could be a Dark Souls boss or something.

700
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,160
Also, I'm so stupid.

701
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,840
Like, I've been watching Nimi play, uh...

702
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,140
Elden Ring?

703
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,720
Elden Ring.

704
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,420
And I was just like...

705
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,600
I was like, wow.

706
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,180
This game...

707
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,040
Feels like Dark Souls.

708
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,920
And because of my brain, I...

709
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,980
I could...

710
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,660
I replaced Elden Ring with Elder Scrolls.

711
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,020
And so, I was just like, is she...

712
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,720
Is she playing, like, Skyrim?

713
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,840
I was like, I thought Skyrim was different than this.

714
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,440
It's so weird.

715
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
I was like, huh?

716
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,720
This looks so hard.

717
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,300
People told me to play Skyrim.

718
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:53,640
I...

719
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,480
I'm gonna...

720
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,140
I'm gonna die all the time.

721
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,720
So, I was like...

722
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,420
This whole time, she's been playing it for, like, weeks.

723
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,880
And my dumb ass has been like, why is it like Dark Souls?

724
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,200
I thought it was an adventure game.

725
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
The reason Virgil is so nasally is because he had a cold.

726
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,080
I think that was a myth though, no?

727
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,750
And Elden Scrolls.

728
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,310
Has an online feature.

729
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,550
I did see that.

730
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,250
Um...

731
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,210
I did see that because it asked me at the beginning of the game.

732
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,950
It was just like...

733
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,110
There's a photo mode!

734
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,850
Hold on, sorry.

735
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,790
It asked me at the beginning of the game.

736
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,570
It was like, do you...

737
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,710
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be this obnoxious with pausing usually, but...

738
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,570
It asked me if I wanted to, um...

739
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,590
Uh...

740
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,870
Like, play with friends or not.

741
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,570
Smile, Nero!

742
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,090
He's got his little...

743
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,230
He's got his little...

744
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,690
Oh, sorry.

745
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,130
Oh.

746
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,350
I saw...

747
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,970
I definitely saw his skull.

748
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,270
Wow, buddy.

749
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,410
We need to get you on some sort of skin care routine.

750
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,910
Like, pronto.

751
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,570
Holy!

752
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,770
I saw his teeth.

753
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,590
Yeah.

754
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,130
He's got teeth.

755
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,810
Oof.

756
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,550
It's okay.

757
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,270
He still...

758
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,030
He looks like old Jack Frost.

759
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,010
Okay.

760
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,330
Moisturize!

761
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,230
He's like, I'm too busy fighting demons.

762
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,890
Wait, what's up right this way?

763
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,250
A lot of nothing.

764
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,220
RE engine?

765
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,060
But yeah, but like...

766
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,400
But like...

767
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,840
Leon is...

768
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,880
He's like...

769
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,720
Fishy boy.

770
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,690
Lady!

771
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,530
Oh my god!

772
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,550
Trish!

773
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,030
Everybody's down!

774
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,090
Dang!

775
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,770
Uh-oh.

776
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,610
Uh-oh.

777
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,990
Looks like this won't be a total waste of time after all.

778
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,190
Hey!

779
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,590
Jackass!

780
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,770
Didn't your mother ever teach you it's not nice to steal?

781
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,290
Wait, I'm supposed to fight something that...

782
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,710
Sorry Dante!

783
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,690
Took out our whole team?

784
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,490
I'm bagging this bitch!

785
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,230
Yeah!

786
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,630
Oh no!

787
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,710
Oh no!

788
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,450
Yeah, I totally...

789
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,170
Know how to do that.

790
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,410
Oh yeah, I totally know how

791
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,940
to...

792
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,400
Oh!

793
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,860
I jumped right into it.

794
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,720
I tried to jump away from it.

795
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,840
Ah!

796
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,960
Wait, can I still dot?

797
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,520
Oh yeah, I can.

798
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,740
Okay.

799
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,300
Oh!

800
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:50,760
Wait!

801
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,160
No!

802
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Oh,

803
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,370
I missed the boat!

804
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,430
Oh my god!

805
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,470
Oh my god!

806
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,730
He's actually hard!

807
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,090
Oh, come on!

808
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,060
Is

809
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,900
this one of those fights you're not actually supposed to win?

810
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,000
Because um...

811
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,260
Why?

812
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,260
You barely hit an empty...

813
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,100
Oh god!

814
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,780
You can win?

815
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,440
No way.

816
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,220
Oh, oops.

817
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,660
See guys, it's all according to plan.

818
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,300
You can actually beat it, that's crazy.

819
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,780
This is it!

820
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,780
This is the end!

821
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,980
It's all over!

822
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,180
Help us, Kylo Ren!

823
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Use the force!

824
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,260
Oh my god.

825
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,120
Nero got beat in like two seconds.

826
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,640
Dante?

827
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,960
Oh my god.

828
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,900
This is so old.

829
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,300
How much time took place after...

830
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,220
Four?

831
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,740
Round two.

832
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,120
Oh my god.

833
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,740
Elderly Ren!

834
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,510
No!

835
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,530
Damn!

836
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,270
Oh!

837
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,050
Oh!

838
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:49,730
Oh!

839
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,350
Dead weight!

840
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,190
You must leave here!

841
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,410
You are stronger than we ever could have imagined!

842
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,260
Oh!

843
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,140
Noooo!

844
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,040
Frosted call me Deadweight!

845
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,040
But he come all this way for the other!

846
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, you're gonna lose your other arm, Nero!

847
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,430
There's Alan.

848
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,970
Dante won't lose.

849
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,830
Oh my god.

850
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,470
Oh my god.

851
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:44,850
Look at that!

852
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,170
Oh wait.

853
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:46,930
Uh oh!

854
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,450
This is bad.

855
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:47,870
Sorry.

856
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,870
I was looking at the wrong thing.

857
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,530
No!

858
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:49,650
No!

859
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,020
Rebellion!

860
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,730
Someone defeat Groot right now!

861
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:05,750
No!

862
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,970
Wait, he's still alive, though.

863
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,430
It's fine.

864
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,830
Ew!

865
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,650
What?

866
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,390
Me too!

867
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,870
It doesn't look good.

868
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,650
Oh no!

869
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,150
Oh no!

870
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,870
Why were you all standing so close?

871
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,050
Dante lost?

872
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,990
Dante!

873
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,270
Just casually walking away.

874
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,540
What?

875
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:20,540
See?

876
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,020
What?

877
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,320
It's so dramatic.

878
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh.

879
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,420
No!

880
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,360
Oh, we're on June now.

881
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,020
Being part demon is the dry skin and massive pores.

882
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,460
Yeah.

883
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,580
See for clap.

884
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,140
Ah!

885
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,320
Uh-oh.

886
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,360
We had, like...

887
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,720
A whole month...

888
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,700
To get better.

889
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,340
Niko niko n...

890
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,000
One month later.

891
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,400
There's so many new characters now.

892
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,340
They've expanded business like crazy.

893
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,280
One month ago.

894
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,120
In light of this incident.

895
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,240
The government...

896
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,190
This is a trial from the heavens above.

897
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,150
Same crap, different day.

898
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,570
So, tell me.

899
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,450
Tell you what?

900
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,670
Tell you what?

901
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,830
How does it feel to be rescuing the guy that killed your father?

902
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,090
Hey, I'm glad we're getting personal.

903
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,230
Well, he abandoned my mother and I and left us for dead.

904
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,390
So, I feel nothing.

905
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,310
Well, he's not exactly going up for father of the year ward now, is he?

906
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,090
Hmm...

907
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,550
His research wasn't that bad.

908
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,670
Came in handy.

909
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,570
Mowbley, thank you for that.

910
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,570
I have to do that in here.

911
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,870
It already smells like gas.

912
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,190
That's you.

913
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,920
Oh, nasty.

914
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,100
Hey, Niko.

915
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,440
Don't lose your tits.

916
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,060
I'll see you.

917
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,660
Wow, the branded truck.

918
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
It's so good.

919
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,640
Hey, you have to hit every single bump in the road.

920
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,780
She's just taking out a few.

921
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,910
This is how you play any sort of, like, GTA game.

922
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,630
Oh my god!

923
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,920
Ow!

924
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,760
The credits!

925
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,480
Yeah!

926
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,070
I'm doing all this, by the way.

927
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,710
Oh my god, I just noticed his robot part.

928
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,990
It's not...

929
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,710
There's no arm attached, but...

930
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,370
Oh yeah!

931
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,340
Wait!

932
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,600
Wait!

933
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,340
Wait!

934
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,600
I just realized with Sire!

935
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,440
Bang!

936
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:58,940
Bang!

937
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,340
Bang!

938
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,840
Pull my devil trigger!

939
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,020
Oh

940
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,210
my god!

941
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,150
Oh my god!

942
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,730
Oh!

943
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,210
Nice!

944
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:29,290
Nice.

945
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,530
This game does not promote smoking.

946
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,710
Thank you.

947
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,810
Thank you, game.

948
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,290
Oh, look at the five on the truck.

949
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,370
That's so cute.

950
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,190
Devil May Cry 5.

951
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,120
No, Nero doesn't like smoking.

952
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,600
He said it was stinky.

953
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,700
Oh.

954
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
You got this.

955
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,520
June 15th, 5am.

956
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,340
Yeah, be like Nero.

957
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,220
Oh my god.

958
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,440
The bus is here.

959
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,200
Your Uber driver is here.

960
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,740
You look like you need a hug.

961
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,180
But you're not going to get one from me.

962
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,400
You better get lost.

963
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,360
Hey, who are you?

964
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,880
Hey, you're going to get yourself killed.

965
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,320
Don't crap yourself.

966
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,880
He likes to kill demon things.

967
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,140
Let him do his thing.

968
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,820
I like her country action.

969
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:56,940
You know what I said?

970
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
You don't want I'm son of a bitch.

971
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,680
You're going to die.

972
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,940
He's like, just watch it.

973
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,220
Whoa!

974
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,000
Wait a second.

975
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,560
Is that our grabby grab?

976
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,320
All right.

977
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,420
Time to kick some ass.

978
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,060
Never notice the five on the truck?

979
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
Wait, is that our grabby grab?

980
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,780
Press B to perform your devil breaker special attack.

981
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,920
Taking damage while executing this attack will destroy your current devil breaker.

982
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,900
Hold B then release.

983
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,360
Verging an attack will make that attack more powerful.

984
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,720
But the devil breaker you have equipped will be destroyed.

985
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,360
I've got some cleaning up to do.

986
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,480
This guy's okay, right?

987
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:55,760
Wait, so...

988
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,000
Two at once.

989
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,240
I can't.

990
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm too good at this game.

991
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,310
Oh my

992
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:21,740
god.

993
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,060
This guy is having...

994
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,160
He's having like an epiphany.

995
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,280
A life-changing moment.

996
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,660
To kick demon ass.

997
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,580
Oh, no.

998
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,440
Hey, psycho!

999
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,840
Watch the merchandise.

1000
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,200
Hey, stop bitchin' and take cover.

1001
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,780
This is...

1002
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,340
It's a little...

1003
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,840
It's fine.

1004
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,940
How does it do that though?

1005
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,620
How many are in there?

1006
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,620
Wire snatch.

1007
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,480
Oh my god.

1008
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:57,860
Wait.

1009
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,600
Enhanced grabby grab.

1010
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,280
Pulling enemies you've locked onto.

1011
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,840
Heavy enemies can't be pulled in.

1012
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,780
So use this technique to pull closer instead.

1013
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,220
Break away.

1014
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,000
I'll be...

1015
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,560
You can forcefully have severed your devil breaker.

1016
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,140
To generate an explosion.

1017
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,180
You can use this to get out of dangerous situations.

1018
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,420
What?

1019
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,040
Wait.

1020
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,120
Come here.

1021
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,240
Come here.

1022
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:25,810
Yeah.

1023
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:26,610
Wait.

1024
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:27,870
Oh.

1025
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,210
Oh.

1026
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,050
My bad.

1027
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,330
Stop drop and roll.

1028
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,890
Stop drop and roll.

1029
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:35,890
Wait.

1030
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:36,230
LB.

1031
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,510
Ow.

1032
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,330
Neat.

1033
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,450
I'm really getting the hang of this new toy.

1034
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:43,970
Shut up.

1035
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:44,910
Shut up.

1036
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:45,870
Shut up.

1037
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,840
Getting used to it.

1038
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,720
Getting used to it.

1039
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,400
Oh.

1040
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,140
Someone read it.

1041
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:01,700
Thank you.

1042
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,560
Overture.

1043
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,400
Picking up devil breakers.

1044
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,280
Touch a devil breaker.

1045
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,560
Walk over any devil breaker you find to pick it up.

1046
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,640
And equip it automatically.

1047
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,720
You cannot pick up any new arms if your magazine is already full.

1048
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,580
Do I have...

1049
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,720
Do I have ammo in this game?

1050
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,660
They're disposable.

1051
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,600
They're consumables?

1052
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,780
You have arms.

1053
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,880
Arm ammo.

1054
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,360
No.

1055
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,260
No way.

1056
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,820
No.

1057
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,220
No.

1058
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,520
No.

1059
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,200
My devil may cry would never...

1060
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,340
Wait.

1061
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:46,960
There's another one.

1062
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,940
Oh.

1063
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,360
Okay.

1064
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,720
Thanks.

1065
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,440
She just left it on the ground for us.

1066
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,200
That doesn't seem good.

1067
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,660
Wait.

1068
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,360
What did I just do?

1069
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,940
What did I just grab?

1070
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,900
Where did I get these from?

1071
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,060
Where are the rorbs coming from though?

1072
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,080
I don't...

1073
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,480
Wait.

1074
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,780
Am I supposed to kill these?

1075
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,000
No.

1076
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,340
Oh.

1077
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,640
I just noticed they're like human faces.

1078
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,600
They're even worse than I first thought.

1079
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,040
I don't see where the rorbs are.

1080
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,220
Where...

1081
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,880
Oh, there...

1082
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,520
There's...

1083
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,800
Oh.

1084
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,340
I see him now.

1085
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,100
Aha.

1086
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:39,800
I see.

1087
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,160
I see.

1088
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,340
I see him now.

1089
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,920
I need...

1090
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,840
I need air hike, like...

1091
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,620
Pronto.

1092
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,820
Whee.

1093
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:51,940
Where is he?

1094
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,560
Where did that guy go?

1095
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,760
Hello?

1096
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,020
Oh.

1097
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,000
Whoa.

1098
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,020
What is that?

1099
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,550
Oh.

1100
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,530
There's more.

1101
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:13,590
Crazy.

1102
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,470
Oh, there's another one.

1103
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:18,650
Okay.

1104
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:18,910
Oh.

1105
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,370
Bye.

1106
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,390
Oh my god.

1107
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,330
Hold down, V.

1108
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,510
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding.

1109
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,220
Hey.

1110
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,180
Chill out.

1111
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:38,920
Okay.

1112
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,360
So that, there's like a charge attack.

1113
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,740
Okay.

1114
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,900
I guess I killed that guy in the explosion.

1115
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,820
I didn't even realize.

1116
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:46,980
Oops.

1117
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,740
What a lovely house plant.

1118
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,700
All the fo...

1119
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,480
Faults.

1120
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,020
Roots.

1121
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,450
You missed the blor...

1122
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,450
There was a blorb!

1123
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,850
I'm still getting used to the intense...

1124
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:34,890
I brought the marshmallows.

1125
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,690
I'm revving, but it's like not working.

1126
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:38,850
Dodging.

1127
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,630
Yeah, I did that.

1128
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,990
Okay.

1129
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,430
Am I revving?

1130
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:43,410
Oh.

1131
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,900
Oh.

1132
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,020
Swing in a minute.

1133
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,700
Okay.

1134
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,320
Whoop.

1135
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,300
Whoop.

1136
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,320
Whoop.

1137
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,960
It's shining.

1138
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,400
Yeah.

1139
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,060
Oh.

1140
00:48:59,180 --> 00:48:59,340
Ouch.

1141
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,540
Two.

1142
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,700
Oh.

1143
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,580
Oh my gosh.

1144
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,300
Dang, they hit hard.

1145
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,060
Wait.

1146
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,240
Oh.

1147
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,240
Let me, let me rev up.

1148
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,040
Oh.

1149
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,120
That didn't do nearly as much as I thought it would do.

1150
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,940
Okay, never mind.

1151
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,540
I just...

1152
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,880
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

1153
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,090
Oh, wait.

1154
00:49:59,170 --> 00:49:59,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1155
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,820
I feel slower in this game.

1156
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,580
I don't know why.

1157
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,480
Ouch.

1158
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,180
Am I slower?

1159
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,520
Or is it just...

1160
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,140
Arm

1161
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,730
that blew up.

1162
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,030
Ah.

1163
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:22,810
Oh.

1164
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,250
It's a little slower.

1165
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:38,990
The camera's further out, I think.

1166
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:39,830
Maybe that's it.

1167
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,110
My depth perception.

1168
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,810
We'll get faster with upgrades.

1169
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,150
Hey.

1170
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:48,790
Tough guy.

1171
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,170
That'll keep up, but not for long.

1172
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:51,530
What do you mean?

1173
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,090
Soldier boy said city's gone to hell and back.

1174
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,270
Taken over by the underworld.

1175
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,770
Uh-oh.

1176
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,250
Not just here, but everywhere.

1177
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,590
Why don't you know the game and secrets on our first playthrough?

1178
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,010
I know.

1179
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,290
Yamato did this.

1180
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,480
April 3rd.

1181
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,940
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

1182
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,360
Why do I feel like your pet mechanic?

1183
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,420
We're so close to the actual day.

1184
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,440
Don't get used to it.

1185
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,060
Hey.

1186
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,270
Be right there.

1187
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,030
Who's that?

1188
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:38,630
Hey.

1189
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,390
Sounds cute.

1190
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,270
Why don't you go ahead?

1191
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,190
I'm gonna finish up here.

1192
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,290
Nero's such a handy...

1193
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,730
Nero's the actual handyman.

1194
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:45,630
Not.

1195
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:46,610
Not.

1196
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:46,790
Not.

1197
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,420
Oh, it's Kirie.

1198
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,200
Wait, actually?

1199
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,480
Is this her?

1200
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,100
Oh.

1201
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,020
Kirie, you've changed.

1202
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,000
You've...

1203
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:06,940
Your style.

1204
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,140
This guy needs an inhaler.

1205
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,800
Oh, this is how he loses his arm.

1206
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,170
Nero, the food's getting clean.

1207
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,830
Kirie, get back inside now!

1208
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:37,210
Oh!

1209
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,780
What?

1210
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,840
He just stole it?

1211
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,000
No way!

1212
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,020
Back?

1213
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,680
Oh my god!

1214
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,640
Look at that stance.

1215
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,660
I'm running out of time.

1216
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,330
For real?

1217
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,390
He just took his arm!

1218
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,230
Nero bleeds out.

1219
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,210
End of game.

1220
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:41,870
All of this is just finna.

1221
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,270
Oh, dream.

1222
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,570
Trying not to get us killed on the way there.

1223
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,150
He was taking it back.

1224
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,050
Let's...

1225
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,810
It's Virgil's sword!

1226
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,520
Wait, I kind of miss having like a...

1227
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,240
The full...

1228
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:13,800
S...

1229
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,440
D...

1230
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,980
C...

1231
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,600
A...

1232
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,420
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1233
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,370
This game is filled with secrets and easter eggs at every corner and there's no...

1234
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,560
Longer any time penalty, so you're free to explore.

1235
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,900
Ah, okay, cool.

1236
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,480
Nero got disarmed.

1237
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,980
I like this time...

1238
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,400
Oh, look!

1239
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,440
It even shows who's together in the like the timeline.

1240
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,340
That's it.

1241
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,600
No more wheels from here.

1242
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,360
All right.

1243
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,620
Guess I'm walking then.

1244
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,300
Yo, yo, yo.

1245
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,580
Check it out.

1246
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,760
Yo, yo, yo.

1247
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,580
And this is...

1248
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,000
From Morrison.

1249
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,120
I think it's...

1250
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,020
I keep adjusting the audio just like before.

1251
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,780
Oh, Morrison's letter.

1252
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,500
It's been a good 30 years since I last wrote something like a letter.

1253
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,260
Don't have a typewriter or nothing.

1254
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,500
So, unfortunately, you're stuck with my shitty handwriting for now.

1255
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,080
I heard you're heading back to Redgrave.

1256
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,560
Wasn't sure exactly what I could do for you.

1257
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,660
I'm not a powerhouse like you or the sharpest knife in the drawer.

1258
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,660
Still giving my business.

1259
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,500
The least I can do is get you a few leads.

1260
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,120
Can't say exactly how useful they'll be to you, but hey, gotta be better than nothing, right?

1261
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,140
I like this music.

1262
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,560
So, the first time I met Dante, he actually went by a different name.

1263
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,140
Tony...

1264
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,840
Tony Redgrave.

1265
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:43,710
Morrison was in the anime.

1266
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,050
Ah, gotcha, gotcha.

1267
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:50,150
Tony Redgrave.

1268
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,090
Bet that got your attention, huh?

1269
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,410
Tony Redgrave?

1270
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,570
Redgrave City?

1271
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,670
Just a coincidence?

1272
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:56,750
Or something more?

1273
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,230
I honestly can't say.

1274
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,990
Still, figured if you're heading into that...

1275
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,030
In that direction, you might be able to learn the truth yourself.

1276
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,550
That's why I've decided to tell you everything about the Dante I know.

1277
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,450
It ain't every day that I just give this stuff away, boy.

1278
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,010
You best be grateful.

1279
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,370
Morrison's letter.

1280
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,770
The more missions you complete, the more information you'll be able to be like Morrison's letter.

1281
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,110
Boy, we get all of Dante's secrets.

1282
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,510
It's...

1283
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,930
Hey, are we doing this or what?

1284
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,110
Yes, this is a very serious alias.

1285
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,010
I'm waiting on you.

1286
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,830
I'm cooking.

1287
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,690
Any special orders?

1288
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,230
Oh, do we buy from her?

1289
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,310
In this game?

1290
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,070
What's with mint and robot armed guys?

1291
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,010
I don't know!

1292
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,030
Hey, I got a new arm for ya.

1293
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,830
Sparta tools!

1294
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:48,890
So cute!

1295
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,230
I really worked out a sweat on that one!

1296
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:53,350
Geburra?

1297
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:54,010
Whoa!

1298
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:57,790
Customize.

1299
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:03,590
Here you can use Rorbs to acquire skills, replenish items, or change equipped gear to help you get a leg up in battle.

1300
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,170
Durable.

1301
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:10,110
Cycle through the tabs at the top of the screen to select a section to customize.

1302
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,150
Uh, you can acquire skills and abilities.

1303
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,510
Once you have acquired a skill or ability, you won't be able to reverse the...

1304
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,930
I won't be able...

1305
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,770
Oh, I like how they're just like, hey!

1306
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,750
Um, remember how you used to be able to be like, I don't like this.

1307
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,590
I'm gonna sell it.

1308
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,830
Not this time.

1309
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,410
No refunds here!

1310
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,010
Won't be able to reverse the decision.

1311
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,670
Select try to test them out before making a commitment!

1312
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,190
Oh my god!

1313
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,030
That's crazy!

1314
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,750
Devil breakers.

1315
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,150
Wow!

1316
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:45,230
Buy in bulk.

1317
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:45,750
Okay.

1318
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,630
And our equipment.

1319
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:55,410
Use edit to help find a setup that best fits your fighting style.

1320
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:55,910
Okay.

1321
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,400
The Florb is like...

1322
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,950
This is an actual Megamind.

1323
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,190
I don't think the Gorb should be called a Gorb.

1324
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,170
It's a triangle.

1325
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,150
It's not an orb.

1326
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,530
Here you can buy orbs to increase.

1327
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:14,210
Okay.

1328
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:15,890
Whoa!

1329
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:17,370
A speed!

1330
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,090
Table Hopper.

1331
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,330
Wire Snatch 2.

1332
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,590
Air hike, my beloved.

1333
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,310
Enemy Stip.

1334
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,750
I didn't buy that before, but I kind of want to try it this time.

1335
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,770
I'm sorry.

1336
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,370
How much is that?

1337
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,790
One.

1338
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,370
Zero.

1339
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:35,850
Zero.

1340
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,350
Zero.

1341
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,390
Zero.

1342
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:38,150
Zero.

1343
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:38,490
Zero.

1344
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,010
Zero.

1345
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,360
It's an armory!

1346
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,040
Hold on.

1347
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,160
Let me make sure I read the correct amount of zeros.

1348
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:52,640
Zero.

1349
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,080
Zero.

1350
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,460
Zero.

1351
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,200
Zero.

1352
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:55,680
Zero.

1353
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,180
Zero.

1354
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,800
A special taunt given only to those who paid a heavy price.

1355
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,760
Increases stylish rank more than a normal taunt.

1356
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:11,740
It better be like all the way to super stylish, sexy, stylin'.

1357
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,020
Super sexy style beyond.

1358
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,720
Pay to taunt!

1359
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,520
That's crazy!

1360
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,280
Oh my gosh!

1361
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,980
It's worth all right.

1362
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,380
Yeah.

1363
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,780
Blue Rose, color up too.

1364
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,400
Red Queen.

1365
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,460
Wait, is this our...

1366
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,330
This looks like our...

1367
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:44,840
Wait.

1368
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,100
What's...

1369
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,880
I want to see what it...

1370
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,400
Try it out in the void!

1371
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:50,660
Whoa!

1372
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,160
The void is a training ground offering free reign to try out skills and techniques.

1373
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,940
Tweak specific settings in the menu to set up a training session just for you!

1374
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:58,400
Wow.

1375
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,560
Remember when 500 orbs was expensive?

1376
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,620
Does this thing attack me?

1377
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,920
Or are you just like gonna stand there?

1378
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,370
Are you gonna do it?

1379
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,830
Oh, he is just like a...

1380
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,110
He's just a little guy.

1381
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,290
He's a punching bag.

1382
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,320
It feels so good.

1383
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,010
Why am I turning around?

1384
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,810
Why does it turn around?

1385
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,520
Is it not locked on?

1386
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,180
I guess so.

1387
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,100
Okay.

1388
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:08,680
Wow.

1389
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,300
It's even showing what my movements are.

1390
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,140
You guys can see.

1391
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,840
That's crazy.

1392
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:13,560
Wow.

1393
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,460
You can see everything I'm doing.

1394
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:16,300
Wait.

1395
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,400
Guess what I'm gonna do.

1396
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,280
Whoa.

1397
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:43,680
How do I get out of here?

1398
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,020
I went out of...

1399
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,840
Does exit...

1400
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,500
Oh, leave the void.

1401
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:47,880
Okay, good.

1402
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:49,380
Quit the void.

1403
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,380
Yes, get me out of the void.

1404
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,280
I think I'm gonna learn this one.

1405
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:56,860
Yes.

1406
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,840
There it is.

1407
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,160
Streak two, baby.

1408
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:00,720
Split.

1409
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,820
Back Y.

1410
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:04,720
Oh, mid-air.

1411
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1412
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,120
Red queen combo.

1413
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,680
We know many of these.

1414
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,720
Or rather, like, we are familiar with many of these.

1415
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,540
Is there an air hike there is?

1416
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,460
I cannot afford it.

1417
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,940
Color up deals a good amount of damage.

1418
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,480
Hold on.

1419
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:27,780
Let's see.

1420
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,320
Exceed.

1421
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,900
Oh, oh.

1422
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,120
Devil breaker.

1423
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,480
Devil breaker plus?

1424
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,220
Oh, plus one magazine.

1425
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:41,640
Okay.

1426
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,140
I love that she's just chilling here.

1427
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,360
But I kind of missed the music from the last game.

1428
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,800
More arm slots.

1429
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,160
Yeah, it sounds pretty...

1430
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,140
It sounds like it could be worth it.

1431
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,180
We still have 12,000, so...

1432
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,740
Speed.

1433
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,520
Yes, thank you.

1434
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,020
Yeah, we definitely want speed.

1435
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,540
I think I'll use...

1436
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,740
Oh, and these two I can even try out.

1437
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,900
I will definitely use a wire snatch too.

1438
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,960
I want to get speed though.

1439
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,620
Oh, just a little bit.

1440
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:22,380
Viewers are reacting with excitement and amusement to a character named Mint jorking her sword in the game.

1441
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:27,040
They are providing tips and suggestions for optimizing her moves and abilities.

1442
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,800
Wow, speed!

1443
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,140
Happy birthday!

1444
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,760
Happy birthday to you.

1445
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,520
Happy birthday dear Speed King.

1446
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,780
Happy birthday to you.

1447
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,480
Happy birthday!

1448
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:54,920
Nice.

1449
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,080
Wait, I wanna try.

1450
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,900
How do you just mid-air press A near an enemy?

1451
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,880
Wait, I wanna try it.

1452
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,000
Why is this one so expensive?

1453
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,340
I don't remember it being this pricey before.

1454
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,540
Why is it so expensive now?

1455
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:08,920
Oh.

1456
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,800
Wait, where are you?

1457
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:18,800
W-w-w-w-w, w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w.

1458
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:30,700
Wait, come here.

1459
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,360
Why can't you just keep jumping on him?

1460
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,950
Wait.

1461
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,050
Wait.

1462
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,090
Try taunting the air.

1463
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,310
Right and hide.

1464
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,710
Wait, hold on.

1465
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,870
Let's get airborne.

1466
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,510
Come on.

1467
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:02,610
Come on.

1468
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:06,790
Wait.

1469
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:07,270
Wait.

1470
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:09,250
Whoa.

1471
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,590
Wait, hold on.

1472
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,110
Come here, come here.

1473
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,350
Oh, I keep forgetting to like, when you do this.

1474
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:19,370
So

1475
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:23,330
cute.

1476
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:25,110
Bad night.

1477
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,090
Come here.

1478
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,730
Try to rev after the taunt.

1479
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,030
Wait, rev?

1480
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:38,490
Also...

1481
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:39,830
Oh, there it is.

1482
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,130
Okay.

1483
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:44,430
Um...

1484
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:48,770
It's getting cool.

1485
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:57,870
Wait.

1486
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,210
Someone said to rev.

1487
01:05:59,330 --> 01:05:59,950
I see it.

1488
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:00,570
I see it now.

1489
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,050
It looks the same.

1490
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:05,970
Let's get airborne.

1491
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,110
Woo!

1492
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,090
Shall we dance?

1493
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,370
Taunt then rev.

1494
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:24,790
Oh.

1495
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,450
What'd you say?

1496
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,850
Taunt then rev, rev, rev.

1497
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,390
You can rev and taunt.

1498
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:32,830
I can't?

1499
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,430
What'd you say?

1500
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,330
I'm confused!

1501
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,330
Right now.

1502
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:39,110
Wait.

1503
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,150
Hold on.

1504
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:40,810
Wait.

1505
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,210
Let's get airborne.

1506
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,330
Like that?

1507
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:44,790
Oh, it's...

1508
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:45,110
It won.

1509
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,570
Wow, it did it in one try.

1510
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,070
Oh, I see.

1511
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,470
I see.

1512
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,790
Oh.

1513
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:51,910
Oh.

1514
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:52,710
No, it didn't.

1515
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,310
Wait.

1516
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,970
It was taunt.

1517
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:55,730
Wait.

1518
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:57,410
Wait, what was it?

1519
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:57,790
Which...

1520
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,350
What was the order?

1521
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:02,290
Ah, there it is.

1522
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:02,850
Ah, I did it.

1523
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,130
I did it.

1524
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:03,470
I did it.

1525
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,990
Okay, okay.

1526
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:07,110
Uh...

1527
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:07,590
Okay, hold on.

1528
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:09,770
Oh, wait.

1529
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,330
Ah, wait.

1530
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:12,890
What's the timing?

1531
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:14,850
What's the timing?

1532
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,650
It's timing perfectly.

1533
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,790
Yeah, I gotta get it.

1534
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:19,210
Hold on.

1535
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,830
Am I too early?

1536
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,410
Hold on.

1537
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:26,290
What?

1538
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:29,130
When he puts his feet on the sword.

1539
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,410
Okay.

1540
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,830
Let's get airborne.

1541
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,230
I mean, it's tough.

1542
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:37,990
Like always.

1543
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:46,670
Ah!

1544
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,510
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

1545
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:51,870
Oh, timing.

1546
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:54,710
Okay.

1547
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:57,870
Okay.

1548
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,570
It's something you'll get your...

1549
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,790
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

1550
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,010
Ah!

1551
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,930
See, sometimes I get it so easily.

1552
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,650
And sometimes I don't.

1553
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,170
But I'll keep practicing it.

1554
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:09,610
Oh!

1555
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,810
We did it twice this time.

1556
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:15,250
Let's get airborne.

1557
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:16,270
Okay.

1558
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:18,530
Ah!

1559
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:18,630
Hi!

1560
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,290
Hey, hey hey hey.

1561
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,510
Side-sepping.

1562
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:29,630
Go, go Nero!

1563
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:30,230
Go, Nero!

1564
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,490
Go!

1565
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,370
Go, Nero!

1566
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:32,230
Go!

1567
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,030
Go, Nero!

1568
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,670
Go, Nero!

1569
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,530
Go, Nero!

1570
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,510
That was handy, though.

1571
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,470
Thank you for teaching that to me, you guys.

1572
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,550
Get more orbs!

1573
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,070
I want it.

1574
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:00,150
Okay.

1575
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:02,830
Let's see.

1576
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,450
Let's see.

1577
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:11,270
Maybe... Maybe I'll save up for... Wire Snatch 2.

1578
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:12,870
Air Hike.

1579
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:13,250
Okay.

1580
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:14,170
Wait.

1581
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:15,170
Oh, no.

1582
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,610
I want to see the other stuff, too.

1583
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:17,370
Devil Breakers.

1584
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:17,970
Oh!

1585
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,390
Oh, you got... Wait.

1586
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:24,610
A mobile... Devil Breaker letting you cancel attacks with shockwaves or fire.

1587
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:26,750
Converged...

1588
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,390
Oh, wait.

1589
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,890
Can I... Do I have enough for... Oh, I do have enough for this one.

1590
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:31,470
We'll expand.

1591
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,830
You can get up to eight!

1592
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:38,550
Wow.

1593
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,130
Hi, Dada!

1594
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:44,610
Buy in bulk.

1595
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,330
Purchase one of each Devil Breaker.

1596
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,450
Currently available in the menu.

1597
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,350
There's no discount for buying in bulk.

1598
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:50,830
Okay.

1599
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,030
Letting you cancel attacks.

1600
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,550
I'll try it.

1601
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,850
Just finish at the gym.

1602
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,790
What's here?

1603
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:06,870
What did this bring?

1604
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:07,590
Some trivia.

1605
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:12,030
Dante was in debt because he didn't charge people if they were poor and sends money to...

1606
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:15,310
If... To... To... A late partner's daughter out of guilt.

1607
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,070
Wee...

1608
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:21,450
Oh, we have one in here.

1609
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,330
Let's put that in there.

1610
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,330
I guess we'll... Get to try it eventually.

1611
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,030
Oh, God.

1612
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,090
That thing is hideous.

1613
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,310
It's so ugly.

1614
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:35,250
That thing made...

1615
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:38,370
I don't think I never... I didn't think that...

1616
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,190
I didn't think that they really could make it any worse looking.

1617
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:47,150
But, like, they just...

1618
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,710
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,250
I'm blurb shaming right now.

1620
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,750
It's so bad.

1621
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:56,510
Oh, my gosh.

1622
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,370
It's so bad.

1623
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:02,490
Holy...

1624
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:02,870
Okay.

1625
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,250
Quick customization.

1626
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,710
Yeah, I want to actually like...

1627
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,770
We'll just get into the game.

1628
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:07,850
We can always do more custom...

1629
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:08,730
I'm guessing...

1630
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,590
Yeah, you can customize after every mission.

1631
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,110
There you go.

1632
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,190
Customize screen is accessible from the mission menu.

1633
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,090
Wait, so...

1634
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,510
There's no...

1635
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,230
So only the mission menu?

1636
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,130
Blorb watched with...

1637
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,210
Blorb goes bent up.

1638
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,330
You'll see?

1639
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,130
Oh, okay.

1640
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,410
You have some mid-mission.

1641
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:31,730
Okay.

1642
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,750
Mission star...

1643
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,450
Wait, why is it an exclamation point?

1644
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:40,650
There's so many...

1645
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,110
It's like so familiar and so different at the same time.

1646
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:44,610
It's strange.

1647
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:45,370
You know?

1648
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,750
It's so strange.

1649
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,490
There she is!

1650
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,170
Oh.

1651
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,950
Sorry, ma'am.

1652
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,790
Shall we dance?

1653
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:03,570
Taunt her?

1654
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,210
I did.

1655
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,390
What'd you say?

1656
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:07,250
What'd you say?

1657
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,950
Wait, now?

1658
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,450
Let's get in!

1659
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,390
I'm too good!

1660
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:21,870
Damn, they even stole the clothes off the mannequins.

1661
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,690
I need to catch up to V.

1662
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:24,410
Fast.

1663
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,950
Okay.

1664
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:34,090
Is that a person standing there or...

1665
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:34,950
Oh, these are...

1666
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,730
Oh, technically.

1667
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:36,930
Technically, yes.

1668
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,020
Oh, look at that shadow!

1669
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:43,800
Oh my god, that's so awesome!

1670
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,380
This is so messed up.

1671
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:48,480
Ew!

1672
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:52,580
Nice.

1673
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,580
Give me...

1674
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,740
Roars...

1675
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,120
Oh, there's some more over here.

1676
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,040
Okay.

1677
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,500
You guys said to explore a little bit more.

1678
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,340
I am exploring.

1679
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,400
I'm exploring.

1680
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,720
Oh, yeah!

1681
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,600
I hate furniture!

1682
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,720
Yeah!

1683
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,880
We hate furniture!

1684
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,420
Wait, what's up here?

1685
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,540
Anything?

1686
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,020
Smokin' sick...

1687
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,360
Snack shack!

1688
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,080
I like the decorations in this area.

1689
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:32,820
It's very cute.

1690
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,080
It's so trendy here.

1691
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,060
Smokin' snake...

1692
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:37,440
Wait.

1693
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,420
Smokin' sick...

1694
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,140
Snack...

1695
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,940
Shack.

1696
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:42,500
Oh!

1697
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,240
I think I scared him off.

1698
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:44,720
My bad.

1699
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:45,760
Yeah!

1700
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,540
We hate benches!

1701
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,320
We hate any form of furniture!

1702
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,820
Oh, gosh!

1703
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,580
The people...

1704
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:50,820
Ew!

1705
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,100
What if you touch them?

1706
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,240
It's so gross!

1707
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,120
Coffee...

1708
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:55,840
And donut!

1709
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,200
Wait.

1710
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,220
It's like an eyeball.

1711
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,320
Look how cute it is!

1712
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,440
But...

1713
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,060
Breaking furniture doesn't seem to give you anything anymore.

1714
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,880
And that's...

1715
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,900
Pretty disappointing.

1716
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:16,740
I'm not gonna lie.

1717
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,980
Not gonna lie.

1718
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,240
That makes me a little bit sad.

1719
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,200
Hachiko?

1720
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,100
Ah...

1721
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,960
Miro, you monster!

1722
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,660
What if you get the bad end just for doing that?

1723
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,300
Wait.

1724
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,920
Now I'm the evil creature.

1725
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,970
Whoa, the atmosphere is so cool.

1726
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:00,910
Oh,

1727
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:07,920
stylish rank.

1728
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:08,640
Savage.

1729
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,920
Among other things, the length and variety of your combos determine how many stylish points you get.

1730
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,040
Ooh, yeah, we know.

1731
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,700
Oh, I'm here.

1732
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,440
I'm here.

1733
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,240
Wait.

1734
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,420
Oh, I forgot to do it.

1735
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,260
Wait.

1736
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,500
Ah, no, wait.

1737
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,260
Ah, yeah!

1738
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:51,460
Woo!

1739
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,700
Come here.

1740
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,280
Ah, dang it.

1741
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,820
I almost had it.

1742
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:08,720
Yeah.

1743
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,180
Oh.

1744
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:11,860
Yeah.

1745
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,920
Rup, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1746
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,100
Riding high.

1747
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,660
Oh, ah, yeah, yeah.

1748
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:28,020
Ew.

1749
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,520
Ooh, he's nasty.

1750
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,340
You only get song lyrics on B and up.

1751
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,140
Let's get air for it.

1752
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:43,880
No way.

1753
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,280
Riding high.

1754
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,460
Let's get air for it.

1755
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,200
Ah!

1756
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,340
Okay, that took me a couple tries.

1757
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,260
That took me a little bit.

1758
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,180
Kind

1759
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:10,440
of, how would you identify, like, a secret, you know?

1760
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,780
Like, what would be, like, to look, be on the lookout for to find a...

1761
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,040
Oh, yeah, my hands.

1762
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:20,600
Thank you.

1763
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,180
Yeah, yeah.

1764
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,290
The B button.

1765
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,830
Something's doing in a city like this.

1766
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,750
Something to this place.

1767
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:33,030
Hmm.

1768
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,470
Something suspi...

1769
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:35,630
Oh.

1770
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,770
A hand.

1771
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,910
Let's go.

1772
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,970
How did she get over here?

1773
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,410
How did she get over here?

1774
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:54,720
Secret.

1775
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,780
Yeah, I know you can rev after every hit.

1776
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,760
I'm just...

1777
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,040
Uh, I...

1778
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,080
I...

1779
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:06,720
Did not really get used to it in, um...

1780
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,620
The first game.

1781
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,260
So...

1782
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,560
Or, like, in...

1783
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:13,900
Uh...

1784
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,320
Four.

1785
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:16,320
So, I didn't really learn how to do it.

1786
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:17,500
Can you actually defeat these things?

1787
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,480
You can?

1788
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,020
Playing DMC2?

1789
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:32,400
Nice.

1790
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:37,890
Get away!

1791
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,940
Not making it easy for me, huh?

1792
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,620
Oh, there's more.

1793
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,140
I love the way he sidesteps.

1794
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,580
Oh, there's more?

1795
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:04,740
Oh!

1796
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:11,750
Oh.

1797
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,950
I wish I had that...

1798
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:13,310
What's it called?

1799
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,090
Come here!

1800
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:14,430
Come here!

1801
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,010
Dude, where are you going?

1802
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:19,550
What the hell are you?

1803
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:20,350
Wait!

1804
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,550
I can't hit you at all!

1805
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,390
Out of the way!

1806
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,990
Oh, I can't even lift you up!

1807
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:25,930
Come here!

1808
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:27,010
Wait...

1809
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,830
I can't...

1810
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:33,480
Ouch!

1811
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,400
He's too fat!

1812
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,300
He's got, like, mega rorbs, though.

1813
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,840
Okay, I'm just going in circles, but...

1814
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,260
Dummy thick man.

1815
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,660
He's the roar bug.

1816
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,820
I want my, like...

1817
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:00,780
The one that you go in the air and then you go...

1818
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,000
On the ground.

1819
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,620
I want that one back.

1820
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,160
I've never seen them fight back.

1821
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:09,880
Oh, yeah.

1822
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,400
Um, I was just showing you all the features of the game.

1823
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,300
Okay, I'll keep going now.

1824
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,020
Split!

1825
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:21,520
Yeah!

1826
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:35,900
Oh!

1827
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,520
Oh!

1828
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,040
Oh!

1829
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:49,580
Oh!

1830
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:49,680
Oh!

1831
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:49,840
Oh!

1832
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,180
Oh my God!

1833
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,320
Oh, dang it!

1834
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:02,500
Holy cow!

1835
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,020
Come on!

1836
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,110
Oh my God!

1837
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:16,450
Holy cow!

1838
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,570
Get out of my gun!

1839
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,250
Yippee!

1840
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,440
I like how I grab them and then shoot them away.

1841
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,100
Whoa!

1842
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,700
Whoa!

1843
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:47,580
Oh, yo!

1844
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:49,400
Whoa!

1845
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,640
She's feeling motivated.

1846
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,720
Bang!

1847
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,180
Bang!

1848
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:03,620
Bang!

1849
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,870
A little bit.

1850
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:12,830
Let's go, baby!

1851
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:13,250
Let's go!

1852
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:13,650
Whoa!

1853
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:13,830
Whoa!

1854
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:18,630
Anything on top of the horse?

1855
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,150
So close.

1856
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:22,730
Come on, Nero.

1857
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:23,810
Come on, Nero.

1858
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:25,270
Live your...

1859
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,130
My little pony.

1860
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:28,870
He's like, I'm a...

1861
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:29,850
Pegasister.

1862
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:31,870
Wait.

1863
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:32,910
He would be brony.

1864
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,310
So how do you...

1865
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,970
Like, how easy is it to break the arms?

1866
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,970
Because I haven't even broken a single one.

1867
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,370
Stand down its head?

1868
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,030
That's what I was trying to do.

1869
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,430
Can you actually...

1870
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,950
Stay on the horse?

1871
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:51,330
I'm trying to actually get on it.

1872
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:52,850
Wait.

1873
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,650
I actually am trying to...

1874
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:55,130
Oh!

1875
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:00,310
See?

1876
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:00,950
I knew.

1877
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,690
I knew that there was something about the horse.

1878
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:05,370
I knew.

1879
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:05,890
I knew.

1880
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,430
I knew.

1881
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:08,170
I knew my senses were tingling.

1882
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:11,450
But yeah.

1883
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:12,350
What was it?

1884
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,670
Sorry.

1885
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,150
What?

1886
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,620
What was it about the arm?

1887
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,020
Charge, attack, or LB bomb?

1888
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,800
Oh, that's right!

1889
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:28,540
You can LB!

1890
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,300
I keep thinking that's...

1891
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,280
You know...

1892
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,000
Or...

1893
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,300
Devil trigger, so...

1894
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,900
Aw, these people were just trying to leave.

1895
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,020
This guy looks so sad.

1896
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,400
Oops, sorry.

1897
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,440
I barely touched him.

1898
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,060
Oh, sorry.

1899
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:50,920
Sorry.

1900
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:53,540
I barely touched him.

1901
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:53,920
Come on, Nero.

1902
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,740
Have a little bit of tact, please.

1903
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,340
Don't worry about breaking them.

1904
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,240
Wait, can I get up there?

1905
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:08,820
Oh, oh.

1906
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,560
So close.

1907
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,020
You got this.

1908
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:11,800
You got this, buddy.

1909
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,640
Or you could use the stairs.

1910
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,500
Let's do that.

1911
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,620
Just trying to be a little extra over here.

1912
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:21,740
Wow!

1913
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:22,920
Oh my gosh.

1914
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,040
Thank you so much for the 15th.

1915
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:24,640
Thank you!

1916
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,040
Woohoo!

1917
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,160
Oh yeah!

1918
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,260
Wait, I'm gonna try it.

1919
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,480
Maybe it's a waste on this guy, though.

1920
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,140
Maybe it's a waste on this guy.

1921
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,400
Oh no!

1922
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:42,900
It's a...

1923
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,760
Oh look, it's this guy!

1924
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,450
Oh, he's leaving!

1925
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,510
No, come back!

1926
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,250
He's like, wrong hotel!

1927
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:56,910
Wait, hold on.

1928
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:57,390
Let me try it.

1929
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,890
I think I killed all of them, no?

1930
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:14,890
Hold B?

1931
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,390
Oh, wait.

1932
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:17,410
What's LB then?

1933
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,320
Ah, to throw it away.

1934
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,180
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1935
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,500
So hold.

1936
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,380
Okay.

1937
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:39,750
I keep wanting to destroy everything for rorbs.

1938
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,330
But that's just not how the game works anymore.

1939
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:44,390
That's just not how the game works anymore.

1940
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:45,830
Things have changed!

1941
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,500
Hold on.

1942
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,980
Making sure there's no other...

1943
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,840
Wait, is there a map?

1944
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,280
I don't see one.

1945
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,050
Devil may cry.

1946
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,090
It's changed.

1947
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,850
No map, okay.

1948
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:05,690
Though it seems kinda linear, I'm not gonna lie.

1949
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,070
It's not gonna be any place to explore.

1950
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,430
At least in these, you know.

1951
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:14,550
Who's talking?

1952
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,190
Who's yelling?

1953
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:16,130
Huh.

1954
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,270
Looks like I'm gonna make it there before you do, V.

1955
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,310
What do you mean?

1956
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:23,970
V's right there.

1957
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,360
Whoop!

1958
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,320
Oh my god, he just let it happen.

1959
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:35,560
Oh.

1960
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,340
Trying to stop me.

1961
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,600
Whatever shall I do?

1962
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,740
I don't like that.

1963
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:40,760
I don't like that.

1964
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,580
Examine.

1965
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,120
Ew!

1966
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:48,980
Oh!

1967
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,980
Neathog hatchling!

1968
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,340
A hatchling of the parasitic Neathog.

1969
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,800
It feeds on weakened parts of the...

1970
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,960
Clipfoth.

1971
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,880
Destroying its internal structure.

1972
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:04,560
Okay.

1973
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,500
We got a little creature.

1974
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,100
Oh, and I put him in here?

1975
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:08,740
Ew!

1976
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,420
Destroy him!

1977
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:11,940
Ew!

1978
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,260
Parasite.

1979
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,180
Clif...

1980
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,180
Clifloff.

1981
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,100
Clif...

1982
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,120
Clifloff.

1983
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,060
That'll be in case you're grabbed by an enemy.

1984
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,360
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1985
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,700
The arm will explode and stun them.

1986
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,040
It's like an oh shit button.

1987
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,820
Ah, okay.

1988
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,980
Thank you, thank you.

1989
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,240
Okay.

1990
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,420
I will remember.

1991
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,180
Hopefully.

1992
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,600
I'll try to at least.

1993
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:40,160
Okay.

1994
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,160
Wow, there's really...

1995
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,660
It's like exploration, but also not really.

1996
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:47,560
Orbs.

1997
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,100
Oh, here?

1998
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,540
He doesn't seem like a demon to me.

1999
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,220
He's got a lot to say.

2000
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,220
Nero.

2001
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,520
He's got a lot to say.

2002
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,480
Did Mito steal all of Nero's hair and add her hair?

2003
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:09,400
I know, right?

2004
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,620
I should make my hair shorter.

2005
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,320
Nero got his little Jack Frost cut.

2006
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,000
I don't know which one I like.

2007
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,460
Usually I feel like I would prefer this cut, but I don't know what I...

2008
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,880
But on him, I don't know.

2009
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,200
Which...

2010
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,260
Which way did I come from again?

2011
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:25,520
Which way did I come from again?

2012
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,800
Wait, you can't be lost.

2013
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,040
Wait, the next objective.

2014
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,760
Press and hold LS.

2015
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,800
Wait, if you're lost your way...

2016
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,220
What?

2017
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,660
Wait, no way.

2018
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,480
Wait, let's see.

2019
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,240
Wait, I'm...

2020
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:40,980
I'm going this way.

2021
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:50,460
Oh!

2022
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:51,900
Oh, I really...

2023
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,440
It really does.

2024
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:52,800
Okay.

2025
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,280
Oh, I see.

2026
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:54,660
I see.

2027
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,120
Well, hold on.

2028
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,080
I haven't lost my way just yet.

2029
01:28:59,140 --> 01:28:59,500
I...

2030
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,140
I'm...

2031
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:00,960
Oh.

2032
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:05,740
Oh.

2033
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,540
Okay, I'm gonna hold B.

2034
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:10,740
Oh.

2035
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:11,920
I think I messed it up.

2036
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,940
Where is he going?

2037
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:13,700
Wait, come back!

2038
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,680
Hold on!

2039
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,760
Wait, don't leave!

2040
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2041
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,760
Hold on, hold on.

2042
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:28,740
This is the way we're supposed to go.

2043
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,020
What's upstairs?

2044
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:32,820
Nothing.

2045
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,340
Turn around.

2046
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,440
See?

2047
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,580
It pays.

2048
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,360
It pays to explore.

2049
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,100
Literally, it pays.

2050
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,300
Look, we're already almost so close to air hike.

2051
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:45,740
Oh, wait.

2052
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,020
Let's check in here.

2053
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,300
It pays!

2054
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,140
Oh, come on.

2055
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:53,280
There was a trap!

2056
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,260
No!

2057
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,140
Ah!

2058
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:57,680
Ah!

2059
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,480
Don't come rushing at me like that!

2060
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,700
You scared me!

2061
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:02,980
Damn it.

2062
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,380
Hold on.

2063
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,060
Wait.

2064
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:05,940
No.

2065
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,780
Hold on.

2066
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:07,700
Hold on.

2067
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,400
There we go.

2068
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,540
Oh, damn.

2069
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,100
I was two busy times and he missed me.

2070
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,500
Yeah!

2071
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:31,260
Yeah!

2072
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:31,940
Let's get out of my suck!

2073
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,090
Let's get airborne.

2074
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:41,310
Riding hot.

2075
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,510
Let's get airborne.

2076
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:43,630
Riding hot.

2077
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:44,070
Let's get airborne.

2078
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,170
Very good.

2079
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,250
Good job, Nuro.

2080
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,210
Cup, cup, cup, cup.

2081
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,990
I can't get over the way he moves.

2082
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:00,230
It's too good.

2083
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,450
All right.

2084
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,030
All right.

2085
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,790
Oh, we need another...

2086
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,450
Oh, I still have the same one?

2087
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:05,210
No.

2088
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:05,570
Okay.

2089
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,210
I gotta go find another.

2090
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:10,130
Oh.

2091
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:13,210
Let's check this room first.

2092
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:15,210
Okay.

2093
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:16,050
Wow.

2094
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,190
This place, like...

2095
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,670
Where did all the furniture go?

2096
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,290
Like, it went to hell so fast.

2097
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,530
I mean...

2098
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:23,570
Like, it just feels like it was already empty.

2099
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:25,430
Not that the furniture was, like, obliterated.

2100
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,230
Mead hog.

2101
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,110
Mead hog.

2102
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,530
Oh.

2103
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,760
We gone!

2104
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,920
Where are you?

2105
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:51,090
Yeah!

2106
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,430
I got a bluer fragment!

2107
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,610
Where is he?

2108
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,930
Wait, I can't see anything.

2109
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,290
Oh, there we are.

2110
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,410
Where is he?

2111
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,070
Oh, there he is.

2112
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,320
Thank you so much for the raid!

2113
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,580
Hello, hello, hello.

2114
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:38,380
Wahey!

2115
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,200
Yo, we totally got that.

2116
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:40,860
Let's go.

2117
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,540
Oh, look.

2118
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,800
We could've just run over...

2119
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,220
Whatever.

2120
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:46,980
Nice!

2121
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,340
Hiya!

2122
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:49,460
Hiya!

2123
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,240
Hiya!

2124
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:51,520
Hiya!

2125
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,440
Hiya!

2126
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:53,560
Hiya!

2127
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,140
So, it might be worth practicing in the void.

2128
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:55,860
Riding high!

2129
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,260
Okay.

2130
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:57,520
Let's get airborne!

2131
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:58,940
Riding high!

2132
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,560
Let's get airborne!

2133
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:00,780
Ugh!

2134
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,840
I feel like I'm pressing it at the same time every time, but...

2135
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,020
Clearly, I'm not.

2136
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,560
Is there anything else in here?

2137
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:10,020
Just the bluer fragment?

2138
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,600
That was awesome, though, that we found that.

2139
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,480
Very cool.

2140
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,140
Riding high!

2141
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,140
Raymack, thanks for the gifted!

2142
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,440
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

2143
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:19,940
Thank you, guys.

2144
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,280
Probably a three frame.

2145
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:22,860
Maybe.

2146
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,540
Let's get airborne!

2147
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:27,440
Riding high!

2148
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:28,740
And...

2149
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,400
Turn to dust.

2150
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,420
Work.

2151
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:34,940
Nevermind.

2152
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:35,560
Ew!

2153
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,680
Wait, I think I'm...

2154
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:41,940
There we go.

2155
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,860
Actually, I knew I was doing it early on that one.

2156
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,760
Wait, why did I do that when I know I'm gonna do that?

2157
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:48,420
Ah!

2158
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,960
I am getting the timing a bit better.

2159
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,980
Actually.

2160
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:00,840
Ah!

2161
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:01,640
Rude!

2162
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,420
So rude.

2163
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:03,700
Okay.

2164
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,000
Um...

2165
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,580
Oh, here we go.

2166
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:06,600
Oh!

2167
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,920
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2168
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:10,880
I learned something.

2169
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,200
Okay, so...

2170
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,220
Sometimes I don't play my games on my computer.

2171
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,620
Sometimes I play them on, like, my TV.

2172
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:24,620
And I learned that Paws is one of those cats that loves to, like...

2173
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:27,460
She'll, like, look at everything that's happening on the TV.

2174
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,360
And so, uh...

2175
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,320
Last night, I put on cat TV for...

2176
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,420
Like, I just Googled, like, TV for cats.

2177
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:38,040
Or, like, you know, like, videos for cats.

2178
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,260
And, like, it was one with a bunch of birds and stuff.

2179
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,680
And she...

2180
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,520
The whole...

2181
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,120
She was, like, getting up...

2182
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,540
I've never had a cat that would do this.

2183
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:47,680
She was getting on the table.

2184
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,520
She was getting on the TV stand.

2185
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:50,820
She was, like...

2186
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:51,260
She was, like...

2187
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,580
Every bird.

2188
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,320
Oh my god.

2189
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,740
I was, like...

2190
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,300
I was, like...

2191
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:56,640
She's...

2192
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,200
She's doing the cat thing!

2193
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,680
It was so cute!

2194
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,900
I've never had a cat that's done that before.

2195
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,020
So I was, like...

2196
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,900
So I was, like...

2197
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,000
This is so fun.

2198
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,600
Bird, bird, bird.

2199
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,020
And then she would, like, follow the birds with her eyes.

2200
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,120
And I was like, oh my gosh.

2201
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,280
Oh, we can just go around.

2202
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:19,920
Whoa.

2203
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,020
Someone's doing...

2204
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,340
Oh, secret.

2205
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,080
That's what a secret mission is.

2206
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,880
As you progress through missions, you will come across special patterns scrawled on the parts of the environment.

2207
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:31,700
What?

2208
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:36,080
One of my previous cats, Bill, would watch NASCAR and bat at the cars.

2209
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:36,500
Yeah.

2210
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,620
Stand on the glowing point nearby and adjust your viewing angle to line up the pattern.

2211
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,200
What?

2212
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:43,940
That's so cool.

2213
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,100
Secret missions present you with a challenge that...

2214
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:48,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2215
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:50,340
Wait, let's see.

2216
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,560
Where's the glowing part?

2217
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:54,560
Oh.

2218
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:55,240
Oh.

2219
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:56,740
It's...

2220
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,440
Oh, wait.

2221
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:57,820
Oh.

2222
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:58,920
Oh, here.

2223
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:00,400
Oh.

2224
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,480
Secret mission.

2225
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,500
What is it, though?

2226
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,040
Wait.

2227
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,160
Secret mission?

2228
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,740
It said A, no?

2229
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,760
Do I have to line it up even more?

2230
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,340
Oh, there we go.

2231
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,680
Eliminate all of the demons.

2232
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,560
We could probably do this one, right?

2233
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,380
It's an optical puzzle.

2234
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,120
Those are so cool.

2235
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,120
All we gotta do is kill them.

2236
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:31,660
Oh, there's a time limit.

2237
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:32,120
Oh, gosh.

2238
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,500
Oh, shoot.

2239
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:37,940
Hold on.

2240
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,400
Okay.

2241
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:39,760
Never mind.

2242
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,180
I give up.

2243
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,800
Oh, there's flying guys, even.

2244
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,900
Come here.

2245
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:11,640
Oh.

2246
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:12,220
Woo.

2247
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:13,920
I

2248
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:26,010
pulled my devil trigger.

2249
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,060
I don't think I...

2250
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,720
Oh, I made it.

2251
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,600
Second floor fragment.

2252
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,680
I pulled my devil trigger.

2253
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:57,600
Okay.

2254
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:58,120
Cool.

2255
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,620
Hold on.

2256
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,800
I'm gonna...

2257
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,360
Sorry.

2258
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:09,320
If you don't like how I play, just go, please.

2259
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:13,800
Okay.

2260
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,340
Oh, okay.

2261
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,440
Um...

2262
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,080
This way.

2263
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,300
No?

2264
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:24,920
Yes?

2265
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,480
Oh, yes.

2266
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,340
No?

2267
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,400
Excuse me.

2268
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,220
They're in my way.

2269
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,300
Wait.

2270
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:42,740
Oh?

2271
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,380
Hold on.

2272
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,540
This is the time.

2273
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,340
I'm lost.

2274
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:47,760
Last game.

2275
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,040
I'm lost.

2276
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,660
This way.

2277
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,060
Oh.

2278
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,560
Oh, the door is open.

2279
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,840
I couldn't tell.

2280
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,480
Wow, this room is clean.

2281
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,680
How did this room get spared?

2282
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,120
Okay.

2283
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:01,940
Oh.

2284
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:19,760
Oh, dang it.

2285
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:20,120
Hold on.

2286
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:21,480
Ah.

2287
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,100
I couldn't get it.

2288
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:25,480
No.

2289
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:46,450
Come

2290
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:50,470
on.

2291
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,110
Let me just kill one guy, please.

2292
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:52,610
Thank you.

2293
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,130
Oh.

2294
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,680
There we go.

2295
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,180
Savage.

2296
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,240
We can't.

2297
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,600
Oh, I just heard the lyrics though.

2298
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,260
I feel like...

2299
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:14,360
I need her to start singing sooner.

2300
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,460
Hey guys, I'm too good at the game.

2301
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,820
I need to get the S-Rag faster.

2302
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:32,280
Hello.

2303
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,820
Stupid tree, stupid tree, stupid tree.

2304
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,480
Take out your aggression, Miro.

2305
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,940
There's a lot down here.

2306
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:47,840
Is that a...

2307
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,180
Is that a health...

2308
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:50,300
thingy?

2309
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,940
Not the chair.

2310
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,860
It is?

2311
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:57,100
Okay.

2312
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,300
That's what I thought.

2313
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,300
Oh, where did you come from?

2314
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:15,990
Did he die?

2315
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:20,740
Oh my gosh.

2316
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,280
I keep...

2317
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,840
I keep trying to grab them.

2318
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:42,700
I think I got him.

2319
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:44,280
Oh, there's so many Rorbs everywhere.

2320
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:47,700
Oh yeah.

2321
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,660
Sometimes I try to do Buster and I forget that I'm locked on.

2322
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,700
Or vice versa.

2323
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,720
Or I do like it out of order.

2324
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:56,720
Like I'll do...

2325
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,660
I'll lock on...

2326
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,160
I'll do this.

2327
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,320
But I'm...

2328
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,180
You know what I mean?

2329
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,780
It's just, you know...

2330
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,040
Miro, I...

2331
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,460
Only had the chance to play with him for a whole game.

2332
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:12,240
It's not like I would be totally used to him or anything by this point.

2333
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:13,940
That's craziness.

2334
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,480
I only got to play with him the whole time.

2335
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:20,960
Okay, no.

2336
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:21,260
Whatever.

2337
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:22,540
Oh.

2338
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:23,500
Nasty.

2339
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,120
Give me the...

2340
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:25,860
Oh, give me the creature.

2341
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,100
Give me the creature.

2342
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,400
I wish to see the baby.

2343
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,340
Rorb nearby?

2344
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,680
Where at?

2345
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,580
Up here.

2346
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:47,850
Climb the wall.

2347
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:49,130
Um...

2348
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,110
I hate to break it to you, but this is a city.

2349
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,030
There's...

2350
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,270
It's all wall.

2351
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:56,690
Wall by the arm.

2352
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:56,990
Okay.

2353
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:14,500
Oh, that's sick.

2354
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:15,060
Oh.

2355
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,520
Hell...

2356
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,340
End to Nora.

2357
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:21,700
Cool.

2358
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,440
These guys look awesome.

2359
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:23,760
Woo!

2360
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,300
Oh, gosh.

2361
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:28,900
I'm trying to dodge.

2362
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,200
Oh.

2363
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,480
Can I dodge these guys?

2364
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:46,250
If I...

2365
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,220
Chill out.

2366
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:50,600
Chill out.

2367
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:51,220
Oh, gosh.

2368
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,480
I'll challenge it.

2369
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:19,290
I'll challenge it.

2370
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,550
Oh, there it is.

2371
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:21,830
Okay.

2372
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:22,910
Thank you.

2373
01:44:23,110 --> 01:44:26,570
The game was like, that's where you need to put the baby.

2374
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:28,050
Thank you.

2375
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:29,030
Thanks, game.

2376
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:30,670
Okay.

2377
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:31,730
So this wall...

2378
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:33,510
Oh, I see it.

2379
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:34,230
Oh, thank you, guys.

2380
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:36,510
I will take that.

2381
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:37,430
Thank you.

2382
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:43,690
Yeah, you're right.

2383
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:44,670
Oh.

2384
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:45,470
This way.

2385
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:51,450
I still don't understand...

2386
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:52,890
With the...

2387
01:44:52,890 --> 01:44:53,990
With the flea.

2388
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:54,990
Oh, man.

2389
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:56,410
I'm getting sick of this.

2390
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,430
Like...

2391
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:58,050
Do I...

2392
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,350
So I hold it.

2393
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:02,130
And then do I, like, press it again to make it explode?

2394
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:02,630
Or...

2395
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,490
Is it a countdown?

2396
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,860
Oh, you can shoot it.

2397
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,680
You shoot it.

2398
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,160
Ah.

2399
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:19,160
I see.

2400
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:19,400
I see.

2401
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,780
Do I get hurt by my own explosion?

2402
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:24,960
Oh, my God.

2403
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,000
This is so sad.

2404
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,220
Two of them?

2405
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:32,220
No?

2406
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:32,720
Okay.

2407
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:33,580
Yippee.

2408
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,980
This looks like...

2409
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,520
This is, like, so Pompeii.

2410
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:40,360
You know?

2411
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,900
That's what it feels like.

2412
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,380
Oh, that's a person.

2413
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:46,020
Sorry.

2414
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,140
Sad.

2415
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:49,680
Oh, look.

2416
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,200
Warbs.

2417
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:50,860
Sad.

2418
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:51,840
Oh, someone's calling.

2419
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,560
Some telephones still have active phone lines.

2420
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,700
Get closer and check it out.

2421
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:58,100
Uh...

2422
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,440
Moshi, Moshi.

2423
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,260
Yeah?

2424
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,300
I guess the phone still works.

2425
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:09,840
Hello?

2426
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:10,580
Hello?

2427
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,800
Took you long enough, dumbass.

2428
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,080
What happened to the third recall?

2429
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,500
Tell you what.

2430
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,620
You call me now...

2431
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,820
How'd she know I was here?

2432
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:19,860
Oh.

2433
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:21,160
Wait.

2434
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,400
Is this how we...

2435
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,020
Buy from her mid-game?

2436
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:26,460
Wait.

2437
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:27,040
She comes?

2438
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,680
If I call her?

2439
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,080
Wait, that's so awesome.

2440
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,280
Calling Niko.

2441
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,020
You can call Niko's trailer where you can trade red orbs for skills and items.

2442
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,200
Any telephone you find is a chance to call Niko.

2443
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,040
What?

2444
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,020
Uh, let me in.

2445
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,160
This is so cute.

2446
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,180
Wait.

2447
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:52,580
Customize.

2448
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:52,920
Oh.

2449
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,820
You just here to window shop?

2450
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:57,080
All right.

2451
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,960
We have just enough for air hike.

2452
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,240
What do I get that or wire snatch too?

2453
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,920
The music is such a vibe.

2454
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,340
Air hike.

2455
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:16,960
Air hike.

2456
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:17,940
Air hike.

2457
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,320
Air hike.

2458
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:18,800
Air hike.

2459
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,660
I think you guys are right.

2460
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,560
Eddie.

2461
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,560
Welcome to membership.

2462
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:24,100
Thank you.

2463
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:25,660
Air hike is pretty handy.

2464
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:27,460
I'm broke.

2465
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,260
I'm broke.

2466
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,260
Okay.

2467
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:32,480
Bye.

2468
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,140
Bye.

2469
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:40,350
This is so cute.

2470
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:41,590
The way you can just...

2471
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,250
Wait, hold on.

2472
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:43,530
I like this.

2473
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:43,870
Hold on.

2474
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:45,830
Where do I go?

2475
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:48,510
Wow.

2476
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:54,070
It looks like...

2477
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:56,150
It looks like four here.

2478
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:57,330
Like the environment.

2479
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:00,150
Very cool.

2480
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:00,910
All right.

2481
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,290
Who's going to ambush me here?

2482
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:06,350
My first boss?

2483
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:06,810
Already?

2484
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,630
Oh my gosh.

2485
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,950
Our Uber.

2486
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:20,670
Somebody call a doctor?

2487
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:22,930
You limp.

2488
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:26,650
I wasn't expecting any survivors.

2489
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,690
Big boy.

2490
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:35,070
Sorry to disappoint you.

2491
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:36,070
Hey.

2492
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:38,070
You happen to see a guy around here?

2493
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,070
About this big.

2494
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:39,810
Used as a cane?

2495
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:41,230
I was supposed to meet him.

2496
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:42,970
Did you snack on him?

2497
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:43,730
Snack?

2498
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:45,910
I'm your blood.

2499
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:48,890
It's a very precious sacrifice.

2500
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:49,450
Oh my god.

2501
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:50,490
He's so cool looking.

2502
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:51,810
You know it do me no good.

2503
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:54,230
I must have every last trouble.

2504
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:56,390
To rule the underworld.

2505
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:57,910
As king.

2506
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:59,370
He's got a lot of eyeballs.

2507
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:06,430
I don't know.

2508
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:11,630
I mean, you're a big guy and all, but you seem more like a knuckle scrapping fart in the wind than anything else.

2509
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,690
Nero has learned so much from Dante.

2510
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:21,180
You know who I am?

2511
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:35,530
How do you keep any food down?

2512
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:38,270
Whoa.

2513
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:39,030
Oh.

2514
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:41,430
He's chomping on them rocks.

2515
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,390
He's getting all those minerals.

2516
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:44,090
What?

2517
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,380
Do you do parties?

2518
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,880
Oh my god.

2519
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:00,800
Oh no.

2520
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:02,500
Okay, here we go.

2521
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:03,260
Boss battle.

2522
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:03,840
Let's go.

2523
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,200
Whoop.

2524
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:07,600
Yeah, maybe I will.

2525
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,540
Sorry, I'm about to go.

2526
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,900
Oh gosh, I wish I could have dodged that.

2527
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,200
Okay.

2528
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,340
Whoop.

2529
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:30,820
Oh shoot.

2530
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:31,200
Ah.

2531
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:32,380
Whoop.

2532
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:32,840
Whoop.

2533
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:33,660
Whoop.

2534
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,140
Whoop.

2535
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:34,380
Whoop.

2536
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:34,580
Whoop.

2537
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,000
Whoop.

2538
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:41,020
Whoop.

2539
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,100
Whoop.

2540
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:41,580
Uh-oh.

2541
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,260
Uh-oh.

2542
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:42,780
Uh-oh.

2543
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,240
Oh my god.

2544
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,140
No, no, no.

2545
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,260
Holy cow.

2546
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,140
Oh my god.

2547
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,640
I'm gonna lose my first fight.

2548
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:05,200
Let's get here.

2549
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:05,620
Oh my...

2550
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,640
Oops, that's not what I meant to do.

2551
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,600
Ah!

2552
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,020
Holy shit.

2553
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,000
I'm gonna die in this guy.

2554
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:14,900
Wait.

2555
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:15,680
Wait.

2556
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,240
Holy shit.

2557
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,300
Oh my god.

2558
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,180
First death of the game.

2559
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,300
Here it comes.

2560
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,140
Woo!

2561
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:30,420
Wait, can I just have him like collapse the ceiling on himself?

2562
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:32,820
Oh,

2563
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:46,810
oh.

2564
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:47,750
Run Nero, run.

2565
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:48,710
Run Nero, run.

2566
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:49,750
Run Nero, run.

2567
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:50,950
Oh my god.

2568
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:10,150
Oh yeah.

2569
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:11,030
Yeah.

2570
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:14,010
We're back in business, baby.

2571
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,750
Did you just call me?

2572
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:20,790
Would you just call me?

2573
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:21,910
Ouch, ouch.

2574
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:25,850
Ouch.

2575
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:25,950
Oh wait.

2576
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:26,370
Oh shoot.

2577
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:27,610
Please.

2578
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:29,850
Ah!

2579
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:12,740
Holy shit.

2580
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:14,440
Um.

2581
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:15,400
Hold on.

2582
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:16,360
Uh.

2583
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,920
No, I'm gonna die.

2584
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,200
I wish I had a star.

2585
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:36,200
Oh, they gave me just...

2586
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,580
Just a little tiny bit of Gorb.

2587
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,280
Gorb and that's a hit.

2588
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,000
Ah!

2589
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,580
Oh gosh, I'm dead.

2590
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,480
Ah.

2591
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:44,700
Ah.

2592
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:44,920
Ah.

2593
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:46,740
Ah.

2594
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:48,460
Ah.

2595
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,280
I don't even...

2596
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,560
I don't think I have this...

2597
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,840
I could use Rorbs to revive?

2598
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:53,440
Ah.

2599
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:54,880
Ah.

2600
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,020
What?

2601
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,480
You were doing well, though.

2602
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:58,240
Thanks.

2603
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:03,730
I have a Gorb?

2604
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:05,890
When did I use... Oh, I do have one.

2605
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:08,070
Give up is better.

2606
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:08,510
Why?

2607
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:10,770
It's not worth it.

2608
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:15,450
It costs more every time.

2609
01:54:15,610 --> 01:54:16,870
Ah, okay, okay.

2610
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:18,610
Yeah, I don't want to revive here then.

2611
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:23,950
I don't want to... I don't want it to go up on the first battle.

2612
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:24,690
That would suck.

2613
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:27,950
Oh my god.

2614
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:30,850
The last judgment draweth nigh.

2615
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,750
Okay, checkpoint.

2616
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:34,550
Ha.

2617
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:44,030
Wait, so how much does it cost?

2618
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:51,670
How much does it cost to have it?

2619
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,170
Good first try.

2620
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:55,150
I feel like we got pretty... we got pretty far.

2621
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,230
Oh, I'm gonna skip it.

2622
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:02,570
Sorry.

2623
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:08,510
Yeah, maybe I will.

2624
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:10,550
Sorry, I'm about to kill you.

2625
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:21,120
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2626
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,120
Oh my gosh.

2627
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,200
I try to dodge and I instead...

2628
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:29,820
Um...

2629
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:32,630
Um...

2630
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:35,090
I instead, uh...

2631
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:35,630
Jump.

2632
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:38,430
I guess I'm not holding the right stuff around.

2633
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:39,690
I guess I'm not holding the right stuff around.

2634
01:55:40,130 --> 01:55:40,710
WAH!

2635
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,960
Alright, he's already starting to do this.

2636
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,460
WEEE!

2637
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:52,240
WEEE!

2638
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:52,260
WEEE!

2639
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:52,940
It's your grain.

2640
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:54,600
Jack it up all you want.

2641
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,120
You can at least get in little...

2642
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:00,020
...damage.

2643
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:00,640
I Uranus' champion.

2644
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:09,100
Ding it.

2645
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,420
I at least missed it.

2646
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,120
At least I did.

2647
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:13,740
OUGH!

2648
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:41,540
UH!

2649
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:42,540
I CAN'T GET OUT!

2650
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,080
NO, THIS SUCKS!

2651
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,180
NO, PLEASE LET ME OUT!

2652
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:46,940
WHERE AM I?

2653
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,400
Oh, I don't know...

2654
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:54,540
Oh...

2655
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:54,980
That sucked!

2656
01:56:58,460 --> 01:56:58,940
Uh...

2657
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:08,850
Go...

2658
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:09,390
Oh, there he is.

2659
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:10,770
He's just chillin' there.

2660
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:11,230
Ah!

2661
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:12,970
Oh, come on.

2662
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:19,130
Oh, there's another grower!

2663
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:20,250
I see it.

2664
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:23,170
Oh, please.

2665
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:23,870
Ouch.

2666
01:57:25,030 --> 01:57:25,610
Ah, please.

2667
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,640
Wait, how do I use the...

2668
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,540
Wait.

2669
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:37,740
How do I change to a different one?

2670
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,860
Or do I only have burrow left?

2671
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,180
Hold me to change it.

2672
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:47,180
Or charge it.

2673
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:54,450
You're eating garbage now?

2674
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:55,850
Oh, he's eating the garbage.

2675
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:56,190
Oh.

2676
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:57,630
Okay, go, go, go, go.

2677
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:00,230
I only have one left.

2678
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:00,770
What?

2679
01:58:00,850 --> 01:58:01,790
I wasted all of them?

2680
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:03,790
Oh, God!

2681
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:05,230
Holy shit.

2682
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:10,210
Ouch.

2683
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,090
Oh, dang it.

2684
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:18,810
I wasn't close enough.

2685
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:19,410
No!

2686
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:20,790
Oh!

2687
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:21,750
Ouch!

2688
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:23,850
Wait, it unlocked another dorm.

2689
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:25,210
Take it.

2690
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:26,930
Oh, my God.

2691
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:31,800
Oh, my God.

2692
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:32,160
Ouch!

2693
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:45,380
No, please, please!

2694
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,700
Please do any damage!

2695
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:46,860
What?

2696
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:47,380
Come on out!

2697
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,600
This doesn't mere damage.

2698
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:52,880
How about we wrap this Seppin?

2699
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:53,760
Oh!

2700
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,420
Choppa, Choppa, Choppa, Choppa!

2701
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,180
Haa haa

2702
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,860
Just keep dodging, Diro!

2703
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,780
Just keep dodging!

2704
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:12,840
No, no, no, no!

2705
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:13,440
No, no!

2706
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:13,920
No, no, no.

2707
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:14,880
Just keep dodging.

2708
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:15,380
Just keep...

2709
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:16,900
No, no, no, no, no!

2710
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:38,370
Please grab that.

2711
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:39,130
Please grab that.

2712
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:39,830
I got it.

2713
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:40,130
I got it.

2714
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,200
No!

2715
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,450
No!

2716
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:55,690
I was so close!

2717
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,880
I'm so tempted.

2718
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,980
Thank you, Doomguy!

2719
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:21,330
Waste the Rorbs.

2720
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:23,230
How much does it cost?

2721
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:24,010
All of them?

2722
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:25,270
Wait, let's see.

2723
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:28,230
What does it mean?

2724
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:29,570
Revive with three bars.

2725
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:32,870
What?

2726
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:36,610
Wait, next is 7,500.

2727
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:38,370
Oh, hell no.

2728
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:38,750
Wait.

2729
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:39,870
This is insane.

2730
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:42,290
1,500 to 7,500.

2731
02:00:42,290 --> 02:00:45,590
7,500 is insane.

2732
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,990
Wait, they reset every mission?

2733
02:00:48,170 --> 02:00:48,670
Is that true?

2734
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,430
Wait, is that true?

2735
02:00:58,340 --> 02:00:59,920
First use trial.

2736
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:02,000
I'm seeing yes and no.

2737
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,160
So I can't tell.

2738
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:11,010
Mixed messages.

2739
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:12,090
I don't know.

2740
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:15,830
I can hear him yelling in the background.

2741
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:20,000
Ah!

2742
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,280
Well, let's try one more time.

2743
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:23,320
Let's try one more time.

2744
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,960
I think we can get him.

2745
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,000
I think we can get him.

2746
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,400
We were so close this time.

2747
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,920
As long as I don't get sucked, I think I'll be good.

2748
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:34,240
If I don't get sucked, then I think I'll be good.

2749
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:45,220
Oh, wait.

2750
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,340
Well, we kept our Rorbs.

2751
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:47,260
Is there anything we can buy?

2752
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:49,200
Uh, ma'am?

2753
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,880
Is there anything... We can pay for?

2754
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:53,900
Let's see.

2755
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:00,140
She does have a blue Rorbs I can buy.

2756
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:09,540
Oh, I only have one arm left?

2757
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:11,340
Oops, you're so right.

2758
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:20,110
I think I'm gonna buy the Overture arm, though.

2759
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:21,630
Because I think this one...

2760
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:23,470
Oh, wait.

2761
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:24,370
It did also...

2762
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:24,370
Oh.

2763
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:38,230
Try charged...

2764
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:38,930
Burrow.

2765
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:43,430
What's the hold B, right?

2766
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:55,610
It's good for schmoven, is it?

2767
02:02:57,670 --> 02:02:59,650
This game is made to be played in multiple ways.

2768
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:01,050
Yeah, yeah, just if you...

2769
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:05,830
Yeah, if you, like, suggest something and I don't take your suggestion, it's not that I...

2770
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:08,910
You know, everybody has different play styles, so...

2771
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:13,670
I always go with what feels most comfortable for me.

2772
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:16,470
Yeah, yeah.

2773
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:21,700
Um...

2774
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,460
Wait, hold on.

2775
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:26,180
There's some more over here.

2776
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,720
Yeah, no, I just hate you specifically, so true.

2777
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:32,900
Wait, did I miss...

2778
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:33,500
Oh, no, there it is.

2779
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:40,400
Yeah, if I don't listen to you, I specifically hate you in particular.

2780
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:46,870
Why is this glowing?

2781
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,140
She hates me.

2782
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:54,420
There's no such thing as Cooper's hair.

2783
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:57,160
I knew it.

2784
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,520
I don't know what to do.

2785
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,940
I don't think I can buy any sort of abilities.

2786
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,120
I'm broke.

2787
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,280
I'm so broke.

2788
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:08,660
I'm so broke, yeah.

2789
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:09,180
But that's okay.

2790
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,300
Yeah, I'm broke.

2791
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:16,220
Do they not have devil stars in this game or anything?

2792
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:18,720
Sorry for a bit much.

2793
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,300
We're just meaning to let you know all your options.

2794
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:22,220
No, no, that's okay.

2795
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,020
Okay.

2796
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:24,240
Thank you.

2797
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:33,500
Yeah, that's why I kind of want to say, you know, I might not follow what you say, but I appreciate when people, you know, try to help out.

2798
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:34,080
I get it.

2799
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:37,840
No items.

2800
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:38,540
No items.

2801
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:47,360
Wait, so I think this is what the arm is kind of confusing me.

2802
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,460
So maybe I will just.

2803
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:51,000
I'm going to buy.

2804
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:51,960
Okay, I'm going to buy two.

2805
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:54,100
Yes.

2806
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,800
Good choice.

2807
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:05,580
No more holy water.

2808
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:08,480
Okay.

2809
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:12,960
Now we put you in here, right?

2810
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:14,540
And then if I buy.

2811
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:22,620
You know,

2812
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,700
I can find.

2813
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:28,400
Wait.

2814
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,420
Oh, I don't have enough money.

2815
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,020
I'm stupid.

2816
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,460
Oh, well, I guess that's it for us.

2817
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:36,380
Let's go try.

2818
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,160
Loving way three.

2819
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:41,900
Thank you.

2820
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:46,340
Only swap on breaking.

2821
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:46,840
Okay.

2822
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:47,120
Okay.

2823
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:47,380
Okay.

2824
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:49,080
Oh, wait.

2825
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:49,800
I bought it.

2826
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,140
I did.

2827
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:52,600
I thought I had, I would have enough.

2828
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,500
That's why I was so confused.

2829
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:54,900
Okay.

2830
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,260
I was like, what?

2831
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:02,240
I thought I did the math.

2832
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:02,940
Oh.

2833
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:02,960
Cool.

2834
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,240
Yes.

2835
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,700
Here we go.

2836
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,720
This will be a...

2837
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,580
I'll train with it later.

2838
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:12,600
But it'll be our last resort.

2839
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:13,580
Okay.

2840
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:14,140
All right.

2841
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:14,760
Alrighty.

2842
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:16,440
Now we're good to go.

2843
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,640
G to G.

2844
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:24,640
Ho.

2845
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:25,620
All right.

2846
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:36,260
What?

2847
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:36,740
What up?

2848
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:42,280
Ouch.

2849
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:43,280
Ouch.

2850
02:06:54,890 --> 02:06:56,110
Get him in the butt.

2851
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:57,310
Get him in the butt.

2852
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,230
Oh, I took damage on that.

2853
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:02,670
That sucked.

2854
02:07:04,990 --> 02:07:05,270
Okay.

2855
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:08,070
Not as strong as a start as before, but...

2856
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:35,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2857
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2858
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,440
It's gonna start sucking.

2859
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:38,480
Oh, man.

2860
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,280
Okay, we can leave.

2861
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,480
Tommy!

2862
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:09,610
Get us, Tommy!

2863
02:08:10,430 --> 02:08:11,050
Oh, my God.

2864
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:15,890
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

2865
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:18,190
Okay, but nothing to do so much...

2866
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:18,990
So much to us.

2867
02:08:25,970 --> 02:08:26,370
Ouch.

2868
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:36,730
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2869
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,860
I know there's a...

2870
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:46,780
Oh, sorry.

2871
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:47,500
I kept doing...

2872
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:47,820
Oh, my gosh.

2873
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:48,380
I'm so stupid.

2874
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,800
Slice, slice, slice!

2875
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:56,700
Slice, slice, slice!

2876
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:58,600
Slice, slice, slice!

2877
02:08:59,020 --> 02:08:59,460
Okay.

2878
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,300
I got that one.

2879
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:00,600
Nice.

2880
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:05,360
Oh, he's about to start sucking.

2881
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:07,620
Oh, wait.

2882
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,220
Now he's on!

2883
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:09,220
Oh, my God.

2884
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:11,020
I thought he was about to start sucking.

2885
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:12,400
Never mind.

2886
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,280
Wait, now he's gonna start sucking?

2887
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,220
When are you sucking?

2888
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,060
When are we sucking?

2889
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:20,700
I don't know.

2890
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,440
Oh, now he's sucking?

2891
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,100
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

2892
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:29,980
You asshole.

2893
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:35,100
Let's sleep?

2894
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,420
Nevermind.

2895
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:37,500
We're not leaving.

2896
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:46,600
Oh my gosh.

2897
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:47,320
Oh my gosh.

2898
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,340
Run, run, run, run, run.

2899
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,220
Find, find Grorb.

2900
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,800
Find Grorb.

2901
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:53,820
Grorb!

2902
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:05,050
Did I just parry that?

2903
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:07,430
You're eating garbage now?

2904
02:10:07,890 --> 02:10:08,490
Yeah!

2905
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:13,820
Oh my god, the parry!

2906
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:23,880
I totally meant to do that.

2907
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,040
Obviously.

2908
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:32,780
I totally... I knew that was happening and I did that.

2909
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:36,800
Oh my god.

2910
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:36,920
Oh my god.

2911
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:39,100
That made my love so high.

2912
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,980
And me, so low.

2913
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:43,250
Edgar Allan Poe.

2914
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,040
The raven.

2915
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:49,020
Oh!

2916
02:10:49,810 --> 02:10:50,780
The panther.

2917
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:54,840
Stevie, thank you!

2918
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:58,520
Lasagna.

2919
02:10:59,300 --> 02:10:59,680
Lasagna!

2920
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:04,560
Lasagna!

2921
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:09,440
Hey!

2922
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:11,860
Ew!

2923
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:18,980
Hey, don't take my rorbs from me, mister.

2924
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,640
Thought I was gonna have to pick you out of his, uh...

2925
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,520
Tummy teeth.

2926
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:25,200
Tummy teeth!

2927
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:25,940
Hahaha!

2928
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:29,340
I was catching up on some reading.

2929
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:30,320
Yeah.

2930
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:32,360
Looks like a real page turner.

2931
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:33,920
Is that where he got his name from?

2932
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:34,320
V?

2933
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,160
Yeah, he stole my kill!

2934
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:37,240
Whoa!

2935
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:40,420
So, uh...

2936
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:41,780
You think Dante's still in there?

2937
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:46,000
If Fiora's indefeated him, then...

2938
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,860
I expect he's not much more than...

2939
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:50,500
Clyphod pollen by now.

2940
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:52,200
A what?

2941
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:53,320
Clyphod.

2942
02:11:53,980 --> 02:11:56,380
It's a tree that grows in the underworld.

2943
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:00,200
It thrives on human blood and...

2944
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:02,820
Those whose blood it sucks, well...

2945
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:06,260
Let's just say they don't turn out too well.

2946
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:07,800
Oh, that's what happens.

2947
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:11,020
Well, in any case, we need to find out.

2948
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,740
If Dante's alive, we'll save him.

2949
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,000
If not, we don't.

2950
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:15,720
He's alive!

2951
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:18,900
First, we...

2952
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:21,020
Need to exterminate some...

2953
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,660
Clyphod roots.

2954
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:23,420
Clyph...

2955
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:24,600
Clyphoth?

2956
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,260
Is that how you say it?

2957
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:26,920
Clyphoth?

2958
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:28,500
Clyph...

2959
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:30,280
B!

2960
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:33,160
What the hell are you?

2961
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,660
I know, I know, I'm late.

2962
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:41,060
Shut it!

2963
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,060
The road's all clogged!

2964
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:45,340
Hey, you must be B, huh?

2965
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:46,920
Hey, you gonna get that?

2966
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:48,720
Ding, ding, ding, right by your feet!

2967
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:49,540
Oh, what is that?

2968
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:50,800
Oh!

2969
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:51,540
New weapon!

2970
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:53,380
Hoo-ee!

2971
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:55,920
I'm gonna make something amazing out of this...

2972
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,160
Oh, her nails are so cute!

2973
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:59,040
She's so cute!

2974
02:12:59,040 --> 02:12:59,440
Did you just sniff that?

2975
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:01,880
Do you have any idea where that's been?

2976
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:03,380
...up your butt.

2977
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,360
Focus on the mission.

2978
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,200
Yay!

2979
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,660
Oh, it does give us more points.

2980
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:20,580
I see it.

2981
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:24,780
13.

2982
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:29,580
What a woman.

2983
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,680
Wow, we got a lot of warps from that.

2984
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,120
Let's go.

2985
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:37,730
6.26 AM.

2986
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:43,830
Niko is literally... What do you mean, me?

2987
02:13:45,130 --> 02:13:47,410
I think we should split into two groups.

2988
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,950
And cover more ground.

2989
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:50,530
Good idea.

2990
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:51,890
How?

2991
02:13:53,650 --> 02:13:55,110
Behold, my genius.

2992
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:56,350
Oh my god.

2993
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,370
Cash first.

2994
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,450
Why does it gotta be red?

2995
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:02,470
All the materials I collected for your little pet projects don't count for anything.

2996
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:05,450
My brilliant badass work is worth every dime.

2997
02:14:05,590 --> 02:14:06,170
You know it.

2998
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:08,810
Well, your quality control sucks ass.

2999
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:09,630
And you know that.

3000
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:12,170
Or maybe don't let the demon smack you around so much.

3001
02:14:12,410 --> 02:14:12,530
Ooh.

3002
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:13,770
Ooh.

3003
02:14:15,070 --> 02:14:16,170
She's calling me.

3004
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:17,290
She's saying...

3005
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:18,830
I am truly gifted.

3006
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:20,030
She's saying skill issue.

3007
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:32,290
Bird's about to become lunch.

3008
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:37,550
My grandmother was called the .45 caliber virtuoso, legendary gunsmith.

3009
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:39,570
I hope to be like her someday.

3010
02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:42,210
An artist and a lethal artisan.

3011
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:43,550
Oh my god, grandma!

3012
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:44,510
Creator's art.

3013
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:48,910
Whether it's a gun or a steel pot to cook.

3014
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:51,090
Oh, yeah.

3015
02:14:53,950 --> 02:14:55,250
Any more questions?

3016
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:56,350
Huh?

3017
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,790
Little cheeky.

3018
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:00,730
Little cheeky.

3019
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:04,710
I'll take my leave now.

3020
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:07,570
Everybody hates that she smokes in her car.

3021
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:08,670
And if I don't see you along the way.

3022
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:12,530
I'll see you at the bottom of the Klyphod.

3023
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:13,790
Klyphod.

3024
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:14,050
Sure.

3025
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:15,570
Klyphod.

3026
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:16,470
What are you gonna do?

3027
02:15:17,090 --> 02:15:18,710
Can't say that word very well.

3028
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:20,730
I gotta shake the cobwebs out.

3029
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:22,230
I'll let you know.

3030
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:24,570
Hey, you got any more questions?

3031
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:25,810
Better ask it now.

3032
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,130
I can't read minds.

3033
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:31,450
What are the purposes of the buttons on her collar?

3034
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:34,670
Whoa, Malfuji.

3035
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:34,770
Malfuji.

3036
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:38,450
Klyphod.

3037
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:39,650
Yeah, yeah.

3038
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:40,590
She can't...

3039
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:42,750
She can't read minds yet.

3040
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:46,350
Wow, we're only on mission three?

3041
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:46,950
Crazy.

3042
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:49,430
It's called fashion.

3043
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:52,390
Yeah, I knew that.

3044
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:58,110
Hey, hey.

3045
02:15:58,430 --> 02:16:00,390
I got a new arm for ya.

3046
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:01,430
Oh, yeah.

3047
02:16:03,170 --> 02:16:03,770
Punchline!

3048
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:07,390
Helter Skelter!

3049
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:13,890
Wait, we got two new arms?

3050
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,220
Makes up for a lack of range with superior piercing power.

3051
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:24,160
Use it to break through enemy go...

3052
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:24,640
Whoa!

3053
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,560
Oh, golly.

3054
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:29,180
I'm gonna have to be like...

3055
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,960
I'm gonna have to like...

3056
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:34,300
Learn when to...

3057
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:35,160
Oh, my gosh.

3058
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:37,240
So, I can already see.

3059
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:38,980
You have to like set up your...

3060
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:42,460
Your arms in a way that like...

3061
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:43,820
Okay, I just used...

3062
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,920
I just used Overture.

3063
02:16:46,020 --> 02:16:46,800
Now I break it.

3064
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:49,140
And then I use Helter Skelter against this thing.

3065
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:49,960
And I break it.

3066
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:50,760
And then...

3067
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:51,000
Oh!

3068
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:52,240
Loadouts!

3069
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:52,680
Yeah!

3070
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:53,860
Oh, my God.

3071
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:58,160
Interesting.

3072
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:01,620
But how are you supposed to know what kind of enemies are in a run?

3073
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:02,260
Punchline.

3074
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:06,760
This Devil Breaker runs rampant, offering powerful strikes and flying rocket punches.

3075
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,340
You can even mount it to move around.

3076
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:16,400
That's the neat part.

3077
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:17,740
You don't...

3078
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:18,940
People love punchline.

3079
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,980
Yeah, it seems to be the case.

3080
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:21,560
Wait.

3081
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,860
Did she give me any for free?

3082
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:23,680
Yippee!

3083
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:24,640
Wait, so I can...

3084
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,780
Let's try it out.

3085
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:30,060
Powerful strikes and flying rocket punches.

3086
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:34,460
I see.

3087
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,000
I see.

3088
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:36,960
We'll put...

3089
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:37,900
We'll put you here.

3090
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,060
And you here.

3091
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:44,060
If I go into the void and I use all these...

3092
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:44,540
Well...

3093
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,340
They don't...

3094
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:46,340
Yeah, they don't...

3095
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:46,660
Like...

3096
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:47,800
It's not using them.

3097
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:48,800
Like...

3098
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,420
Let's see.

3099
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:49,860
Hold on.

3100
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:53,840
Now, I can get wire snatched too.

3101
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:57,780
Void protects.

3102
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:58,160
Okay.

3103
02:17:58,680 --> 02:17:59,440
They don't get wire snatched.

3104
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,180
What's up?

3105
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:02,680
Oh, wait.

3106
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,120
Uh, let me try.

3107
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:05,680
Okay.

3108
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:19,580
Wait.

3109
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:21,520
Oh, I was...

3110
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,040
I was locked on.

3111
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:22,340
That's why.

3112
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:42,840
Hold B when it comes back?

3113
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:43,260
Okay.

3114
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:50,670
What?

3115
02:18:51,350 --> 02:18:51,790
Ah!

3116
02:18:58,990 --> 02:18:59,550
Uh-oh.

3117
02:18:59,970 --> 02:19:00,050
Uh.

3118
02:19:07,230 --> 02:19:08,210
Come on, baby!

3119
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:09,350
Oh, I lost it.

3120
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:09,690
Oops.

3121
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:10,790
There it goes.

3122
02:19:10,970 --> 02:19:11,490
Okay, hold on.

3123
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:16,990
So this one just...

3124
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:18,890
This one...

3125
02:19:20,990 --> 02:19:21,430
There we go.

3126
02:19:21,430 --> 02:19:21,790
There we go.

3127
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:22,430
And then...

3128
02:19:23,550 --> 02:19:24,030
Okay.

3129
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:28,090
You can attack while riding it too.

3130
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:33,970
Oh, Gerbera.

3131
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:36,450
This guy is so...

3132
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:38,070
He was just lying there.

3133
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:40,670
Like, do I have to get off?

3134
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:44,030
Got a little something for you.

3135
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:49,770
Oh, and I can move with it too.

3136
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,670
Whoa!

3137
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:55,210
Are you okay?

3138
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:00,810
You can aim the beam?

3139
02:20:00,930 --> 02:20:01,150
Yeah!

3140
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:03,470
I only realized that, like, at the very end.

3141
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:05,710
Give me more!

3142
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:06,570
Give me more!

3143
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:07,590
Wait, let's save the board.

3144
02:20:09,310 --> 02:20:10,290
Let's do it again.

3145
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:10,870
Haha.

3146
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,250
Wow.

3147
02:20:13,590 --> 02:20:13,950
Wow.

3148
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:18,610
This needs ibuprofen.

3149
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:20,090
Let's take ibuprofen together.

3150
02:20:21,810 --> 02:20:22,330
Okay.

3151
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:24,250
Those are neat.

3152
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:25,110
I like them.

3153
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:26,190
Oh, there is a reset?

3154
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:26,990
Oh, I didn't even notice.

3155
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:35,790
The punchline is crazy.

3156
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:36,610
Okay, hold on.

3157
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:39,950
Oh.

3158
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:40,590
Oh.

3159
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:41,210
Oh, you, you.

3160
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:45,530
Oh, my God.

3161
02:20:55,350 --> 02:20:57,150
It went back for more!

3162
02:20:57,570 --> 02:20:57,890
Oh!

3163
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:14,400
Wait, I'm just like...

3164
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:14,540
Oh?

3165
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:16,680
Hold me.

3166
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:23,360
I can't... Wait, this feels... This feels so broken.

3167
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:24,260
No?

3168
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:27,360
This is how you're supposed to use it?

3169
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:32,220
Oh my god!

3170
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:35,820
Oh, it does low damage.

3171
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:36,100
Okay.

3172
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,020
Oh yeah, you're right.

3173
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:37,380
You're right.

3174
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:37,660
You're right.

3175
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:37,720
You're right.

3176
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:44,660
This is just one way to use it.

3177
02:21:45,420 --> 02:21:46,980
That's a way to use it, alright.

3178
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:56,540
3, 4, 5, 6, 11... Oh, okay.

3179
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,380
It takes quite a long time, actually.

3180
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:02,580
I

3181
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,640
know you can shoot it to make it go faster.

3182
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:10,040
I just wanted to see how long it takes.

3183
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:11,480
Yeah, that's why you shoot it.

3184
02:22:12,460 --> 02:22:13,760
That's why you shoot it.

3185
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:14,080
Okay.

3186
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:15,200
Very nice.

3187
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:20,320
Actually, I want to just try using this.

3188
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:31,870
Oh my god.

3189
02:22:32,170 --> 02:22:32,790
Wow!

3190
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:34,430
Oh!

3191
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:36,330
That's fun.

3192
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:39,810
Oh my god.

3193
02:22:40,730 --> 02:22:41,070
Oh my god.

3194
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:42,550
Oh my god.

3195
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:44,510
Oh my god.

3196
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:47,730
Overture arm is created using part of Blitz.

3197
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:48,410
Oh no!

3198
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:49,870
Not Blitz!

3199
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:50,930
Oh my god.

3200
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:52,990
Not Blitz, please!

3201
02:22:52,990 --> 02:22:53,230
Jeez!

3202
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:56,690
That thing was hellish.

3203
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:59,350
I'm glad I only had to fight it like two times.

3204
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:10,140
Okay, someone said to try... Wait.

3205
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:15,140
Woah!

3206
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:18,020
Oh!

3207
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:20,480
It was still in the air!

3208
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:22,560
Huh.

3209
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,440
You okay?

3210
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:31,520
While on the ground, just... Wait, was it?

3211
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:35,320
Just before an attack hits.

3212
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:36,580
Oh, this is the...

3213
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:37,400
The dodge.

3214
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:39,080
I didn't realize what was happening.

3215
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:43,720
How am I supposed to... How am I supposed to try it though?

3216
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:45,600
Is that it?

3217
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:49,080
This just feels like a dodge, no?

3218
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:55,920
Oh, you gotta change the settings.

3219
02:24:04,210 --> 02:24:05,710
Well, I'm not gonna buy it anyway.

3220
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:09,110
Very cool.

3221
02:24:09,470 --> 02:24:10,150
Very cool!

3222
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:13,010
Guys...

3223
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:16,990
I know I'm only on mission three.

3224
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:19,170
But I might actually call it today.

3225
02:24:20,330 --> 02:24:21,290
Um...

3226
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:22,850
I...

3227
02:24:22,850 --> 02:24:23,390
Uh...

3228
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:25,370
I got some new medicine.

3229
02:24:25,930 --> 02:24:26,890
And...

3230
02:24:26,890 --> 02:24:28,610
It's known for making you...

3231
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:30,270
Uh...

3232
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:30,670
Uh...

3233
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:31,370
Lightheaded.

3234
02:24:32,210 --> 02:24:33,050
And...

3235
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:33,830
Dizzy.

3236
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:35,710
And...

3237
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:37,030
So...

3238
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:38,210
Um...

3239
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:41,010
Next couple of streams might be a little...

3240
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:41,770
Uh...

3241
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:44,050
Shorter while I get used to it.

3242
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:46,530
Um...

3243
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:49,250
So, I apologize.

3244
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:50,090
I'm sorry.

3245
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:52,410
Um...

3246
02:24:53,450 --> 02:24:54,030
But...

3247
02:24:55,310 --> 02:24:56,470
So far...

3248
02:24:58,930 --> 02:24:59,510
I...

3249
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:01,890
Like this game a lot.

3250
02:25:04,030 --> 02:25:04,610
But...

3251
02:25:04,610 --> 02:25:06,390
It kind of sucks that it just fell...

3252
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:08,690
In that time when I started the new medicine.

3253
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:09,890
So, I'm sorry.

3254
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,320
Um...

3255
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:13,500
But yay!

3256
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:15,460
So...

3257
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:19,280
Thanks for the streamers.

3258
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:19,760
I feel better.

3259
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:20,680
Next time...

3260
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:22,200
I'll do double...

3261
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:22,520
Times.

3262
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:23,560
Since I...

3263
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:24,180
Maybe I'll...

3264
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,820
Maybe I'll switch it from like...

3265
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:27,560
From Friday to...

3266
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:28,560
Sunday or something.

3267
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:32,360
But...

3268
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:33,620
Um...

3269
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:34,860
Yes.

3270
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:36,880
I would like to go...

3271
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:38,240
I would like to go longer...

3272
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:39,040
Next time.

3273
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:40,220
So that we can...

3274
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:41,280
Get through...

3275
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:41,840
Some more stuff.

3276
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:42,260
Instead.

3277
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:46,980
Mission 2 is one of the longer ones.

3278
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:48,240
Because you're trying to figure these things out.

3279
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:48,540
Yeah!

3280
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:48,900
Yeah!

3281
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:49,600
It felt...

3282
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,220
It felt...

3283
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:51,660
I felt like I did more than...

3284
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:52,200
More...

3285
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:52,640
I was like...

3286
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,100
Oh, wait.

3287
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:55,060
We're only on mission 3 at the end of it.

3288
02:25:55,460 --> 02:25:55,780
So...

3289
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,320
But that was okay.

3290
02:25:59,480 --> 02:25:59,800
Yeah.

3291
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:00,040
Yeah.

3292
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:00,300
Yeah.

3293
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:01,080
So thank you guys.

3294
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:02,180
I'm sorry that...

3295
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:03,320
Um...

3296
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:04,160
That...

3297
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,000
Uh...

3298
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:06,440
Uh...

3299
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,160
Uh...

3300
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:08,620
That is a bit shorter today.

3301
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:09,500
But...

3302
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:10,440
Um...

3303
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:11,380
We're learning.

3304
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:12,800
It's good stuff.

3305
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:18,900
Why would you ever apologize for taking care of my I�- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

3306
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,120
That's what I hear coming from you.

3307
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,140
Wah, bah, bah.

3308
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:21,760
Wah, bah, bah.

3309
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:22,780
Wah, bah, bah, bah.

3310
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:26,320
Tutorials are draining.

3311
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:27,820
We'll continue.

3312
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:33,840
Well, um, before I... next time, too, I'll, like, uh... I'll go into the void and I'll, like, practice stuff.

3313
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:38,780
I like the void because it gives me a chance to be, like, before I get into the game to remember how to do everything.

3314
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:40,140
So, yeah!

3315
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:41,440
Thank you, guys.

3316
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:44,420
I hope you guys have a great weekend if I don't see you.

3317
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:46,440
And if I see you, then awesome.

3318
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,020
Um, but yeah, have a... have a good day.

3319
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:50,860
Have a good night.

3320
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:53,420
And, um, don't forget to watch W3.

3321
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,760
I like the void.

3322
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:56,820
Panic!

3323
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:57,920
Thank you for the vibe I'm gifted!

3324
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:03,060
Thanks, Chuna.

3325
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:06,660
Awesome, though!

3326
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,520
Thank you, everybody!

3327
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:08,700
Yeah!

3328
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:09,680
Double big cry five!

3329
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:14,400
Actually, I'm so glad that I went into it so quickly after four.

3330
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:16,540
Because I don't feel like I...

3331
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:22,540
I feel more comfortable with the controls than I probably would have if I had waited a little bit longer, so.

3332
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:24,880
Um, but yeah!

3333
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:27,040
Thank you, guys!

3334
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:28,560
And I'll see you next time!

3335
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:29,760
Bye-bye!

3336
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:30,460
Bye-bye!
