1
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,870
Beep beep, where'd the music go?

2
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,030
I think it doesn't loop.

3
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,510
It was playing this whole time.

4
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,790
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome!

5
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,950
Hey, y'all.

6
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,130
Howdy.

7
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,630
Congratulations on the five-year streaming.

8
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,210
Thank you!

9
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,410
Well, five-year streaming this... this... thur... thursday.

10
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,950
Yeah, this thursday.

11
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,430
Thank you!

12
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,250
Um, we will... we will do a thing on thursday.

13
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,950
And I will have an announcement.

14
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,590
An announcement!

15
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,450
Oh, what could it be?

16
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,310
Let's shake it, baby.

17
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,630
We looked lonely until Minto's streamed.

18
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:07,850
Yeah.

19
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,170
A thing, a thing, a thing.

20
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,110
A thing, a thing, a thing.

21
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,470
Can I get a birthday shout-out?

22
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,030
Your pal, Mai!

23
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,170
Happy birthday!

24
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,210
Happy, happy birthday, Mai!

25
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,450
Welcome, everybody, to Blade Runner.

26
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,690
It's very quiet.

27
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,530
Oh my gosh.

28
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,110
It's very quiet.

29
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,150
I don't know why the music... it doesn't loop.

30
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,230
Sorry.

31
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,510
Um...

32
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,970
But, uh... this is an old... 90s game.

33
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,670
It's retro... we're retro gaming.

34
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,650
We're retro gaming today!

35
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,130
Are you tabbed in?

36
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,150
I absolutely am.

37
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,150
And for some reason, the sensitivity on the mouse is so... slow.

38
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,910
So, hopefully... it improves in the game.

39
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,470
But this is like an old... an old... uh... point and click.

40
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,610
Congrats on five years.

41
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,830
Don't congrats me yet!

42
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,650
It's not yet!

43
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,450
It's not yet!

44
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,390
But thank you.

45
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,910
That's when I arrived.

46
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,610
Thank you!

47
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,830
Thank you for ordering it!

48
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,610
Digital woman, why are you digital?

49
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,810
90s is old now.

50
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,790
You have to... you have to come with ter... to ter...

51
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,650
You have to come to terms now.

52
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,730
The 90s are retro.

53
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,290
It's... it's... it's... it's not your fault.

54
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,250
It's just how time works.

55
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,390
You have to come to terms with it.

56
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,270
No, I'm young!

57
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,170
Right.

58
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,150
2015 is retro?

59
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,610
Okay, wait a second.

60
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,950
That's like only 10 years ago.

61
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,850
Um... thank you for all the zippernets!

62
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,950
Sorry, I can't read them!

63
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,450
Oh, hold on.

64
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,990
I could tab out and read some...

65
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,050
Before I start.

66
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,290
Um...

67
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,690
Finally gets Seiya on global.

68
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,090
Now JPS swimsuit Seiya.

69
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,570
I know!

70
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,530
Sudaku Wiz, thank you for the...

71
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,150
Super chat.

72
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,910
Oh my gosh, you guys.

73
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:19,770
I...

74
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,350
Oh gosh.

75
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,850
Thank you so much for all the super chats!

76
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,450
Thank you guys!

77
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,490
I am very...

78
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,050
I'm... I'm very extremely slow-brained today.

79
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,130
I... I actually... I was like, I'll start a little bit early of a stream.

80
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,470
So that I can play for longer.

81
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,350
And...

82
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,250
I was like, maybe I could even beat the game today.

83
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,470
When I first made my schedule.

84
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,930
And now my brain...

85
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,430
Oh gosh.

86
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,550
I'm so...

87
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,350
Eepy sleepy today.

88
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,270
I...

89
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,850
I woke up...

90
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:48,950
No.

91
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,100
Yesterday, I went to sleep at...

92
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,010
10...

93
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,670
10 p.m.

94
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,930
It wasn't so...

95
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,610
Early.

96
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,090
Uh...

97
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,390
Uh...

98
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,750
Uh...

99
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,110
8 p.m.

100
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,810
or 10 p.m.

101
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,450
I can't remember.

102
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,610
My sleep schedule has been wackadoodle lately.

103
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,490
And...

104
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,430
Um...

105
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,570
But I woke up...

106
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,910
At 3 a.m.

107
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,210
because it's the haunting hour.

108
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,110
And basically, every day, I've been waking up at 3 a.m.

109
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,950
I wake up at 3 a.m.

110
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,770
Uh...

111
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,850
But this time, I was having allergy attack.

112
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,350
And so I took allergy medicine.

113
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,650
And it had antihistamine in it.

114
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,010
Which just...

115
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,410
Which effs me up.

116
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,950
And now...

117
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,450
The whole day, I've been like...

118
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,730
A zombie.

119
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,810
A zombie!

120
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,930
I'm supposed to be a ghost!

121
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,770
And I'm a zombie!

122
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,330
Epee epee baby.

123
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,590
Yes.

124
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,370
Reminder that PS3 is almost 20 years old.

125
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,890
PS4 is 12 years old.

126
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,970
PS3 is almost 20?

127
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,810
It can almost drink?

128
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,370
In the US?

129
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,750
Mito, that's me!

130
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,250
This game was made by Westwood.

131
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,150
Who were most well known for making...

132
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,250
RTS games like Command and Conquer.

133
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,170
They're super talented.

134
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,450
Really excited for this game.

135
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,210
It's really, really cool.

136
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,230
You had to bomb me though.

137
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,110
Thank you!

138
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,850
I was saying...

139
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,550
I was saying...

140
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,690
That I would play this game a lot...

141
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,950
When I was a wee wisp.

142
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,430
I was a wee wisp.

143
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,950
And I would play this game...

144
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,890
With my papa...

145
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,870
Papa Ghost.

146
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,070
And...

147
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,890
He would play this game all the time.

148
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,790
And...

149
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,690
Even though I was a wee wisp...

150
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,810
I still remember so many things about this game.

151
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,910
But I never got to play it myself.

152
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,370
I was always so...

153
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,990
I was always too scared to play it.

154
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,510
It's kind of creepy, you know?

155
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,110
This game.

156
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,390
It's kind of creepy.

157
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,250
But I remember like the most abstract things about this game.

158
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,410
Like I know we're gonna start at a pet shop.

159
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,550
I know that.

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,830
And I know sometimes you go to a restaurant.

161
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,510
And then I know sometimes I...

162
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,430
Uh...

163
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,770
There...

164
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,990
I remember the aesthetic of big shadows on the walls.

165
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,070
Of big fans turning.

166
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,710
With their shadows turning on the walls.

167
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,110
And then I remember a guy who makes puppets.

168
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,190
Um...

169
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,430
And that area scared me a lot.

170
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,610
A lot!

171
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,310
And...

172
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,250
Um...

173
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,310
What else do I remember?

174
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,470
I think that's all I remember.

175
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,890
I remember...

176
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,370
This...

177
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:22,890
This...

178
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,210
This...

179
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,070
This...

180
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,530
Thing...

181
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,790
Traveling...

182
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,830
To and from...

183
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,210
With...

184
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,010
With this thing.

185
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,330
With our floaty car.

186
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:32,830
And...

187
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:33,970
Yeah...

188
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,410
I just...

189
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,590
I remember locations.

190
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,590
And I don't remember any of the story.

191
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,130
Um...

192
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,810
So...

193
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,210
I'll probably...

194
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,230
I'll probably...

195
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,170
If you guys...

196
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,210
Played this before.

197
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,810
And you're just like...

198
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,890
Oh, I remember this.

199
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,510
I will...

200
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,030
I will also be like...

201
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,670
Oh my gosh!

202
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,150
I remember this!

203
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,430
So...

204
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,430
Um...

205
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,430
Did you watch the movies?

206
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,530
You know, I...

207
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,430
Watched...

208
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,170
Probably...

209
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,450
The original Blade Runner.

210
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,330
So, so long ago.

211
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,930
I don't remember it.

212
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,090
But I watched the new one.

213
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,570
The new...

214
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:06,930
The...

215
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,630
The one that...

216
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,310
I watched it.

217
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,930
I watched it because so many people were memeing it.

218
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,230
So I wanted to watch it.

219
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,210
Why...

220
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,230
People were memeing it.

221
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,690
So...

222
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,090
Arigato!

223
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:18,610
Arigato!

224
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,730
Chuuu!

225
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,070
Chuuu!

226
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,550
Thank you!

227
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,450
Happy 5 year anniversary!

228
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,570
It's not my 5 year anniversary yet!

229
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,150
But thank you.

230
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,950
You guys are too early!

231
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,430
Yeah...

232
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,250
The original...

233
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,430
The original is Harrison Ford, no?

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,390
So of course I would love it.

235
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,310
Yeah, with...

236
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,490
With the...

237
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,590
The new one...

238
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,950
What is it?

239
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,590
20-40...

240
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,370
Something.

241
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,270
20...

242
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,050
40...

243
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,430
Something.

244
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,150
Happy your doctor said your throat was looking better.

245
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,930
Thank you!

246
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,390
Thank you, thank you!

247
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,050
Yeah, yesterday I was able to...

248
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,750
Record a cover that I had been putting off for many, many months.

249
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,270
So I was really happy...

250
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,050
That I was able to finally get it done.

251
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,830
And so many things have been on the back burner because of my throat.

252
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,690
So...

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,830
Finally, I'm catching up to things.

254
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,130
It's nice to play games that your parents played with you.

255
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,270
My dad never played anything.

256
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,910
My dad played a lot of games.

257
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,290
And I would...

258
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,770
I would sit and watch.

259
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,610
I was...

260
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,190
I was...

261
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,170
I was a daddy girl.

262
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,330
I...

263
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,250
I...

264
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,890
Um...

265
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,090
Always played games and stuff.

266
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,550
Or watched my dad play games.

267
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,490
He played like...

268
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,550
Like he uh...

269
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,570
Age of Empires.

270
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,750
He always played that.

271
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,430
And uh...

272
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,590
Neverwinter Nights.

273
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,670
He always played that.

274
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,730
And uh...

275
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,350
Tomb Raider.

276
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,430
He always played that.

277
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,030
So...

278
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,370
Yeah!

279
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,770
Speaking of the 90s, I recently acquired Slayers.

280
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,190
Oh!

281
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,250
I finished it today.

282
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,850
I loved it.

283
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,850
Now I'm sad because I want more Slayers.

284
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,670
But isn't Slayers...

285
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,430
I feel like Slayers was one of those...

286
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,850
Shows that felt very long.

287
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,850
I never watched it though.

288
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,010
But the opening is a bop.

289
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,690
Love Neverwinter Nights.

290
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,390
Oh my gosh.

291
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,130
My...

292
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,410
He...

293
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,750
We even had like...

294
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,210
He...

295
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,750
I guess he got the special edition.

296
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,510
And we had like a little...

297
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,810
It came with like a map.

298
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,310
Of like...

299
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,170
Where to go.

300
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,090
Like you know...

301
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,250
A map of the...

302
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,990
Of the city.

303
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,590
All I remember for Neverwinter Nights is the plague at the very beginning.

304
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,290
And how that was my favorite part of the game.

305
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,710
Was watching everybody die.

306
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,270
In the beginning.

307
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,090
In the beginning.

308
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,810
And Draco's...

309
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:47,970
Wait.

310
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,130
It doesn't say how many gifted memberships you gave.

311
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,850
But thank you.

312
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,930
Thank you so much.

313
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,350
But it came with like a little map of the...

314
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,370
Of the...

315
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,130
Of the city.

316
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,130
And my dad would be like...

317
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,690
Okay Mint.

318
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,230
Where do I go next?

319
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,590
And I'd be like...

320
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,190
Okay Dad.

321
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,610
You go here.

322
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,590
Did I use the map?

323
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,010
To tell him where to go.

324
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,310
Even though he already knew.

325
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590
Because he played the game a bajillion times.

326
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,270
He loved Diablo 2.

327
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,150
Not Diablo 2.

328
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,010
I mean he did play Diablo 2.

329
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,330
But he loved Diablo.

330
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,570
Yeah.

331
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:25,910
Yeah.

332
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,530
So.

333
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,390
Did he ever give you an unplugged controller to pretend you're playing?

334
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,730
No.

335
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,150
No.

336
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,730
No.

337
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,770
My dad played more PC games than anything.

338
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,790
I didn't really play.

339
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,390
Yeah.

340
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,450
Eventually he got into like Call of Duty.

341
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,630
And something else.

342
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,410
I can't remember.

343
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,910
There was...

344
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,910
There was some other game.

345
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,650
That was like...

346
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,510
Ugh.

347
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,290
I can't remember.

348
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,430
Tragic.

349
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,210
I don't think he...

350
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,310
I don't think he like was online.

351
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,790
Or...

352
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,090
You know.

353
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,230
He didn't...

354
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,530
He...

355
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:07,770
You know.

356
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,230
It was...

357
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,070
Oh yeah.

358
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,970
The pirate game.

359
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,590
Sid Meier's Pirates.

360
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:12,850
Yeah.

361
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,970
He loved that game too.

362
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,450
Yeah.

363
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,690
Yeah.

364
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,450
Sorry.

365
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,550
I'm just going over memory lane now.

366
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,190
I'll run the win.

367
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,010
Happy birthday.

368
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,950
Happy, happy birthday.

369
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,210
You're walking through a desert.

370
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,530
And you see a turtle flipped over.

371
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,690
On its back in the hot sun.

372
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,990
What do you do?

373
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,390
Flip...

374
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,310
Flip it over?

375
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,710
Yeah.

376
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,390
Anyway.

377
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,950
We should get started.

378
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,310
We'll see how long I go for this.

379
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,230
Because...

380
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,110
I...

381
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,750
Like I said...

382
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,230
I might...

383
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,470
I might get really excited.

384
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,130
And...

385
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,650
And...

386
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,990
And start feeling better.

387
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,830
But...

388
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,550
Right now I'm so...

389
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:51,790
Honk.

390
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,770
Me, me, me, me, me.

391
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,530
So...

392
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:53,750
Yeah.

393
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,130
Okie dokie!

394
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,990
Lance Gaou.

395
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,510
New game.

396
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,750
Difficulty...

397
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,190
What's...

398
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,830
I guess...

399
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,530
What's the...

400
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,250
My personality?

401
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,690
What's a sur...

402
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,610
Don't call me Shirley.

403
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,130
Erratic...

404
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,250
User choice.

405
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,330
I'm polite.

406
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,230
I'm demure.

407
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,710
Wait, what?

408
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,550
This is crazy.

409
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,770
I guess I'll try normal for the base experience.

410
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,430
What is a user's choice?

411
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,550
What if I want to be evil?

412
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,150
Erotic?

413
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:32,670
No!

414
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,150
Oh my gosh.

415
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,010
Card zero.

416
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,870
Thank you so much.

417
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,550
My other day was my birthday.

418
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,390
Happy birthday!

419
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,030
What is this game about?

420
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,350
It's Blade Runner.

421
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,370
Based off the movie.

422
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,710
Wait, do we want to be erotic?

423
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:59,030
You get to the crime scene and you're just like, what seems to be the problem here, officer?

424
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,550
And then...

425
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,550
And then you strip.

426
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,930
And then...

427
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,310
And then...

428
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,470
Robot women come.

429
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,290
Normal is the least fitting personality for you.

430
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,950
Yeah, but...

431
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,270
How...

432
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,570
What is a user's choice?

433
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,910
This is what...

434
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,810
This is the one that makes me most curious.

435
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,670
It's running in parallel to the plot of Blade Runner 1.

436
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:27,670
Yeah!

437
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,630
This is not Harrison Ford.

438
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,050
I don't know who this guy is.

439
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,490
Mint is joy and we're all the Ryan to her gosling.

440
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,250
What does that...

441
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,270
She Ryan on my gosling till I bing bong.

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,600
Okay.

443
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,680
This is not Ryan Reynolds.

444
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,140
This is old man.

445
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,980
Oh, I forgot to mention, I'm playing the enhanced version but I will...

446
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,800
I put it on the classic graphics.

447
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,740
So we'll see how that works.

448
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,140
Hopefully there's no issues.

449
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,260
It's your anniversary.

450
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,820
Happy anniversary.

451
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,040
It's not my anniversary!

452
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,980
But thank you.

453
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,820
She Ryan on my gosling till I Reynolds.

454
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,740
She's erotic, thinks erotic.

455
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,260
I didn't think erotic.

456
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,380
You guys did.

457
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,860
Okay, I'll just go with normal.

458
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,760
What does Shirley mean?

459
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
Hold on, I'm gonna look this up.

460
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,300
Shirley, don't call me Shirley.

461
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Meaning.

462
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,430
Bad-tempered and unfriendly.

463
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,610
That's why they don't want to be called Shirley.

464
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,310
Oh, I see.

465
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,010
It means that you're an asshole.

466
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:56,570
Okay.

467
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,390
Okay, hold on.

468
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,270
I'm gonna look this up.

469
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,210
It's gonna bother me.

470
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:07,070
Blade Runner game user choice personality.

471
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,470
Okay, we get a Steam page.

472
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,510
What does player personality do?

473
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,010
Oh, it's different lines of dialogue.

474
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,770
Oh, I kind of want to be a jerk.

475
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,850
I kind of want to be an asshole.

476
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,390
Be like, get out of my way.

477
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,370
Get out of my way.

478
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,230
User choice gives you more dialogue.

479
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,750
Oh, maybe that's good then.

480
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,410
We can kind of form our own character.

481
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,420
Maybe we try user choice then.

482
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,320
We can be grumpy.

483
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Maybe some days we wake up on the wrong side of the bed.

484
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,620
Some days we're just a happy camper.

485
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,360
All right.

486
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,870
Skip toggle graphics.

487
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,710
Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced robot evolution into the Nexus phase.

488
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,250
A being virtually identical to a human known as a replicant.

489
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,110
The Nexus 6 replicants were superior in strength and agility and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them.

490
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,010
Replicants were used off-world as slave labor in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets.

491
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:36,650
After a bloody mutiny by a Nexus 6 combat team in an off-world colony, replicants were declared illegal on Earth under penalty of death.

492
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,530
Special police squads' Blade Runner units had orders to shoot and kill upon detection any trespassing replicant.

493
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,950
This was not called execution.

494
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,410
It was called retirement.

495
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,890
Los Angeles, November 2019!

496
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,930
Ah, that's the LA.

497
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,390
I know and love modern-day LA.

498
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,930
It's too real!

499
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,850
Why are they copying Snatcher?

500
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,330
No!

501
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,570
Wasn't Snatcher inspired by this?

502
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,030
Big Tungus, thank you!

503
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,470
Oh my gosh!

504
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,170
Lady!

505
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,330
It's the pet sword!

506
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:37,910
I'm leaving now.

507
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,410
Lucy, my sweet.

508
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,530
I cleaned out the tiger cage and sorted all the meal bins.

509
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,930
Now that's a work uniform.

510
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,270
If it's alright, it's my turn to fix dinner.

511
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,590
Uh, uh, haven't you forgotten something, little one?

512
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,070
Just one little thing.

513
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,650
One day.

514
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,170
One day.

515
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,470
Let the lady go home!

516
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,690
It's a very long day.

517
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,630
Oh god, he's holding that- I don't want to.

518
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,810
He's clutching that bird.

519
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,950
No, Lucy, I thought we'd settled this last week.

520
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,670
Don't let's forget who pays your salary.

521
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,990
Yeah, he is.

522
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,950
We're closed.

523
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,870
Come back tomorrow.

524
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,050
LA to a team.

525
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,790
I haven't finished with you.

526
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,970
Those llamas?

527
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,710
I told you, we're closed.

528
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,190
We're not here to buy, little man.

529
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,670
We've come to sell.

530
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,270
Oh.

531
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,510
You can't possibly have anything to interest me.

532
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,330
Why is he gripping that bird?

533
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:30,990
These are extremely rare.

534
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,610
Let him go!

535
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,090
These are extremely rare.

536
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,650
Of the highest quality.

537
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,510
Oh yeah, the llamas are so rare.

538
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,930
What a coincidence.

539
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,710
So am I.

540
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,880
Why is this game so...

541
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,900
Everything is so quiet.

542
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,500
Not my animals.

543
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,260
Please.

544
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,020
I'm begging you.

545
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
No.

546
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,740
But what of honor, little man.

547
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,760
At what price?

548
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,700
Honor.

549
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,140
Oh my god, no.

550
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,160
That tiger is the rarest specimen I've ever seen.

551
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,360
Tiger, tiger burning bright.

552
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,760
In the voice of the night.

553
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,180
In the voice of the night.

554
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,480
VR61661 reports a preceptive...

555
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Were you sleeping and driving?

556
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,780
I was just finishing up my 12 out on patrol when I got the call.

557
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,500
No, you were sleeping.

558
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,240
Welcome relief, considering that the most action I've seen all night was a schizo and grandmother doing the shimmy on her underwear in the second sector.

559
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,000
Sorry for keeping that up for so long.

560
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,420
Auto-pilot.

561
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,100
Sure, sure.

562
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,120
Let me know if I need to turn the audio up though.

563
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,160
I might be adjusting it throughout the stream.

564
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,680
You're naked grandma.

565
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,220
Code three, repeat code three.

566
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
Not the code three.

567
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,120
The last time I had a three was when some hooker vomited Thunderbird on Bryant's desk, and yours truly led the cleanup crew.

568
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,740
A year and a half on the job, it was still the dirtiest work I'd seen.

569
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,300
Where's Captain Bryant?

570
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,900
Took a sick day.

571
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,180
Got himself an anus case of Tomei, though, isn't he?

572
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,480
He asked me personally to run the unit in his absence.

573
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,920
Guza was one of the old-time guys who took their knocks in the streets.

574
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,620
He had a friendly way about him, but you didn't want to turn your back on him if you were less than a friend.

575
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,120
Hope you've been enjoying your leisure time, kid.

576
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,680
Because it's time to take that thumb out of your ass.

577
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,960
Hallelujah.

578
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,580
Don't get too excited.

579
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,580
The other Blade Runners are all jammed up.

580
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,940
Holden's sucking dinner through a straw.

581
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,720
Gaff's working the Tyrell break-in and Steele's working special undercover.

582
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,460
Looks like you got this one by default.

583
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,820
You really know how to make a girl feel wanted.

584
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,920
Animal murder down at Runciter Zoologic.

585
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,720
Animal murder!

586
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,520
I'll just be a schizoid glitz, but we got the call.

587
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,100
Old man Runciter lost something like a billion Chinions worth.

588
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Ten to one, this ain't a job for Rep Detect.

589
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,580
You got something better to do?

590
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,820
Perfect your French cooking, maybe?

591
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,080
He's such a jerk.

592
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,180
Whoa, the lighting is crazy.

593
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,540
It's exactly what I remember.

594
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,360
I thought you were on special assignment.

595
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,180
Hot lady.

596
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Wasn't too damn special after I had the suckers out.

597
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,040
What happened?

598
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,580
A couple of fours were masquerading as fiberplast insulators down at Kaiser.

599
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,020
I dressed up like a nurse.

600
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,060
They never had a chance.

601
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,960
I'll bet.

602
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
You put them on the machine?

603
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,880
I wish I were there to see that.

604
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,120
Hell no.

605
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,140
There's a beautiful little thing in here called the magic.

606
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,800
And it ain't ever been wrong.

607
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,720
You develop it, you got a brilliant career ahead of you.

608
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,140
I'm working on it.

609
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,220
What scoos I got you doing tonight?

610
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:46,960
A.M.

611
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,640
at Runciter's.

612
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
Animal murder.

613
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,020
Oh, those skin jobs got no respect for anything that truly lives and breathes.

614
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,860
And that god damn Eldon Tyrell ought to be zipped into a body bag and flushed into deep space.

615
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,200
Yeah.

616
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,120
Get rid of him, we'd be out of a job.

617
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,700
Oh.

618
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,900
I think we're all overdue for a little off-world paid vacation.

619
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,940
So true.

620
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,360
You can stop staring at my ass now.

621
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,100
You got eyes in the back of your head?

622
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,020
All you gotta do is ask, Slim.

623
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,120
Tau!

624
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,580
She knows she's hot.

625
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,700
Animal sales was a profitable and prestigious business, since most real animals have died out after a terrible war.

626
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh my gosh, I remember this so much.

627
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,020
There were plenty of electric ones, though, powered by rechargeable batteries.

628
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,900
Here we start pointing and clicking, everybody!

629
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,680
No self-respective human would own one of those frauds.

630
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,460
Okay, hold on.

631
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Once...

632
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,580
Oh gosh, this...

633
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,080
It's...

634
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,100
The sensitivity is still pretty bad.

635
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Hopefully that doesn't screw me up during the shooting sequences.

636
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,600
But, um, one thing I am gonna do is I think I'm going to scoot you guys over.

637
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm gonna scoot it over a little bit.

638
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,080
Give me one second.

639
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,700
Just like that.

640
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,140
That should be good.

641
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,600
So you guys can see better.

642
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
And I'm gonna move our notifications down here.

643
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,320
Thank you guys!

644
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,580
You've been scooted.

645
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,540
Perfect!

646
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,700
The music is so good, right?

647
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,200
All right.

648
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,320
Let's start pointing and clicking!

649
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,820
Oh, I see something here.

650
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,420
Find something?

651
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,980
A piece of chrome.

652
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,260
From a car?

653
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,420
No, I think it's horse chrome.

654
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,000
Bag it and tag it.

655
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,340
Bag it and tag it.

656
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,840
What else?

657
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, oh, it turns a different color, I see.

658
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,960
Canvas the area.

659
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,640
Maybe somebody had his eyes open.

660
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,970
I'm on it.

661
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,880
What do you know?

662
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,540
What do you know?

663
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,240
About 30 counts of animal murder and one of aggravated assault.

664
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,120
30?!

665
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,140
The shop's been thrashed.

666
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,220
You ought to see this tiger cup they got here.

667
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,500
No!

668
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,560
It's a goddamn tragedy.

669
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,380
Oh, no!

670
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,840
How's old man Runceter holding up?

671
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm sorry, wait.

672
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,740
This isn't a pet store now.

673
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,440
You'd feel the same way if they were your animals.

674
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,760
How many perps?

675
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,020
At least two.

676
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,640
Bloody footprints all over the scene.

677
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,620
Must be a delightful sight.

678
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,620
No, tiger tiger.

679
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,140
Scratches and paint flecks, and I knew what they meant.

680
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,180
Unless the city had bought a jet black fire truck, somebody had a big fat traffic ticket coming.

681
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,280
Oh, and then this is to go back into our car, right?

682
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,940
I'm testing it out.

683
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,920
We're not leaving.

684
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,940
Maybe we are leaving.

685
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,660
Oh my gosh!

686
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, I remember this so...

687
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,100
How do I get it out of the car?

688
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,640
I guess I just click it.

689
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,120
Okay, here we go.

690
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,340
This is a pet store, but we're selling tigers?

691
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,720
Interesting.

692
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,900
Anybody else got something to say?

693
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
Canvass the area.

694
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,040
Maybe somebody had his eyes open.

695
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,200
Animal strip club.

696
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah, a little bit.

697
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,160
Let's go inside.

698
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,480
I already checked for a crowbar, some kind of tool.

699
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,200
No luck, but it looks like we've got some latency.

700
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,440
Make sure the lab boys run them through the mainframe.

701
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,560
Human and rep.

702
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,420
Human and rep.

703
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,060
Oh, I pressed the...

704
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,740
Okay, I thought I was going inside.

705
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Judging from the distance between the prints, I was looking for two very big men.

706
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,120
One dragged his right foot...

707
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Look at...

708
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,200
See, see, see!

709
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,580
You can see the...

710
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,480
The shadows?

711
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,100
That's exactly what I was talking about.

712
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,720
...graceful even.

713
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,860
Quite a pair.

714
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,460
See these shadows?

715
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,640
Oh my gosh.

716
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,260
This is everything in my memory.

717
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Security camera.

718
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,580
It'd be a banner day if it recorded anything before it was shot out.

719
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,040
Well, that's what Blade Runner was too.

720
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh my gosh.

721
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,780
Look at all the blood.

722
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,320
Oh, even the monkey!

723
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,520
Oh.

724
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,700
Look, I think these are dead animals on the ground.

725
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,480
No!

726
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,500
Wait, I can touch myself.

727
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:11,900
Ah!

728
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,660
Activated the key of database.

729
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,780
Office door force.

730
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,120
Limping footprints.

731
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,960
Graceful footprints.

732
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,980
Oh, whoa.

733
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,580
What the heck is this?

734
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,780
Oh gosh.

735
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,380
We access...

736
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm ruined.

737
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,260
Totally ruined.

738
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
We access the pause menu.

739
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,180
McCoy, LPD.

740
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm absolutely certain Lucy Devlin was involved in this heinous act.

741
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,080
She's the young girl who works for me.

742
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,820
What did I say?

743
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,000
She's responsible for all this mayhem?

744
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,820
No, of course not.

745
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,520
It was two men acting in concert with her, obviously.

746
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,080
Obviously.

747
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,100
What they look like?

748
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,640
Big and scary and absolutely malevolent.

749
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,900
My precious one.

750
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,980
She was my baby.

751
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,840
Oh.

752
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,880
Um, I didn't mean to say it like that.

753
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,160
Wait, what else can I grab here?

754
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,840
You guys know what I meant.

755
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,520
My precious one.

756
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
She was my baby.

757
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,500
Do you want to talk about your precious...

758
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,780
Oh.

759
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,220
Lucy.

760
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,420
Tell me about this Lucy.

761
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:27,940
Yeah.

762
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,900
There's not a lot I can tell you.

763
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,400
She's only worked for me for a short while.

764
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,180
Is she a replicant?

765
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,940
She's about 14 years old with pink hair.

766
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,060
A very attractive young thing.

767
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,860
She's 14!

768
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,580
How'd you find her?

769
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,180
She came to me with a reference from Ogilvy's in the northwest zone.

770
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,760
What were you asking her to do, mister?

771
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,020
And she's a very reputable home salesman.

772
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,380
Uh-oh.

773
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,520
You treat her well?

774
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,700
Also, her hair is purple!

775
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,720
This guy is such a liar!

776
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,640
She got a desk for some place where she worked.

777
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,500
She used to eat over there.

778
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,120
What's the motives here, mister?

779
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,280
Can you think of anything they might have been after?

780
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,900
First, I thought they wanted money, but I don't keep any in the shop.

781
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,280
Then I thought they wanted to steal my animals, but they started executing them.

782
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,000
Could they have been replicants?

783
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,200
Who else would be capable of such barbaric acts?

784
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,820
All my animals.

785
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,980
Yeah, what's the point of murdering a bunch of animals?

786
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,180
Let's go look at her desk.

787
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,300
I think he had one more prompt we can ask, but...

788
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,300
Oh my gosh, we're the slowest walker ever.

789
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,700
Oh, they're monkeys!

790
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,620
I thought they were...

791
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,480
I thought it was a lizard from far away.

792
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,560
Well, isn't that cute?

793
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,480
Monkey!

794
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
What's that?

795
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,380
A candy bar.

796
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,560
Oh, yummy.

797
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,860
Oh, yuck.

798
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't think he and I are gonna get along.

799
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,140
Howie Lee's in Chinatown.

800
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,320
I'd eaten there myself.

801
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,620
We got a cage on the ground, we got a dog.

802
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,460
I love old games because everything you need to click on is highlighted.

803
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
You just... you barely have to think.

804
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,520
A toy dog.

805
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,180
A toy dog.

806
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,320
Okay, it looks like we can go back there, but maybe not yet.

807
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,700
Monkey!

808
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,500
Monkeys.

809
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,120
The vibes are unmatched, right?

810
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,320
So good.

811
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,760
All right, we had one more thing to ask him.

812
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,960
Like the reference.

813
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,960
You ever do any business with the Replicant Manufacturers, Tyrell Corporation?

814
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,640
I resent that accusation.

815
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,780
The way he's moving.

816
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:51,640
Officer, last May I personally sold Governor Kolvig an exquisite Bertrand coat.

817
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,400
I have been a guest at his house on three separate occasions.

818
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,480
Do I look like I need to carry artificial product?

819
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
All my animals.

820
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,760
Okay.

821
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,980
Chill.

822
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,020
Hold on, I have something else to ask.

823
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,900
See if you can dig up that reference for Mogulby's.

824
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,580
Yes, it's somewhere here.

825
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,660
Just a moment.

826
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,620
Peak Noir aesthetic.

827
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,800
Only rivaled by the OG Blade Runner in Dark City.

828
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,360
Oh, he's going.

829
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,120
He's getting it.

830
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,540
Nice.

831
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,500
Our reference.

832
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,300
Oh, did he...

833
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,140
Oh, he's still getting it.

834
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,040
I can't control anything.

835
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,480
My cursor is gone.

836
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,080
Why is he walking in circles?

837
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,100
Here you are.

838
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh, thank you.

839
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,660
He's one of those types that can cannot turn, you know, he can only turn left.

840
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,200
Okay.

841
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,420
I'm ruined.

842
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,380
Totally ruined.

843
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,160
Is that everything?

844
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,520
Stick around.

845
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,880
I may not be finished with you.

846
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,740
I think that's everything that I can see.

847
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,180
Right?

848
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,460
It's so creepy.

849
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,340
Oh my gosh.

850
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:04,640
Wait.

851
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,820
The sound of the water?

852
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,180
I'm ruined.

853
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,820
Totally ruined.

854
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,640
The sound of the water also triggered like a nostalgia.

855
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,420
I think there's like a sewer part we also go through.

856
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,120
Oh my gosh.

857
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,400
Sorry.

858
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,060
I'm going to beat it.

859
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,760
I'm going to be insufferable this whole, this whole play through.

860
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,020
Alex, happy birthday.

861
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Happy, happy birthday.

862
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,580
I'm ruined.

863
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,540
Totally ruined.

864
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,500
Okay.

865
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,260
We get it.

866
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,960
You don't have to keep telling us.

867
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,360
Oh, you can run if you double click it.

868
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:38,780
Nice.

869
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,720
It didn't add up.

870
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,200
Animal murders, the lack of any theft, the small animals alone, were worth a good chunk of change on the street.

871
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,400
Totally ruined.

872
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,080
It seemed more like an act of vengeance.

873
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,340
Find anything else out here?

874
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,920
Zilcho, real actions inside.

875
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,500
Really cute.

876
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,180
Abstract art all over the walls and ceiling.

877
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,520
I never did appreciate art.

878
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:01,960
What?

879
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,600
I mean...

880
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,680
Okay.

881
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,140
All right.

882
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,720
What do I...

883
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Okay, let's see.

884
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,080
Canvas the area.

885
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,760
Maybe somebody had his eyes open.

886
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,200
No.

887
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,980
I'm on it.

888
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,380
Why does it say live?

889
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,800
It really does look like a strip club, doesn't it?

890
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,760
But they're...

891
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,580
But they're animals.

892
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,820
The whole...

893
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,660
The inside too even looked like it.

894
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,120
Make the last name ruined.

895
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,340
First name totally.

896
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,100
I think animal man might be ruined.

897
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,220
I don't know.

898
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,600
I think he needs to say it a couple more times to believe it.

899
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,800
I wonder now...

900
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,630
Do we go somewhere?

901
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,710
There was like the Chinatown he talked about.

902
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,590
I guess we go there.

903
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,150
Aha!

904
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:58,250
Pre-rendered scenes in this game were made with lightweight 3D, which was favorite in the 90s in TV...

905
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,350
Movies and games for realistic lighting.

906
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,650
It's having a renaissance.

907
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,550
Oh, cool.

908
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,190
All right, to Chinatown!

909
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,430
Wow!

910
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,970
This game looks so good.

911
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
And the...

912
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,300
Real sushi was a luxury reserved only for the elite, since most sea life had become radioactive after the Third Terran War.

913
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:24,940
Sushi is not Chinese.

914
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,320
The rest of us had to eat musu, soya mixed with off-world lichen.

915
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,080
Um, the...

916
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,860
The walking, when he's walking, it sounds like, um...

917
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,360
What's it called?

918
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,340
It sounds like the Barbie movies.

919
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,240
It's very, like, clicky-clacky.

920
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,080
McCoy, LPD.

921
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,100
Hey!

922
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,400
Oh, he left.

923
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm talking to you here!

924
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,120
Can I talk to you?

925
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,880
McCoy, LPD.

926
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,820
Hey!

927
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,640
Stop!

928
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,000
Stop it!

929
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,260
This is officer work.

930
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
Ray McCoy, Rep Detect.

931
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,080
Hey!

932
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:01,900
Hey!

933
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,260
Hey!

934
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,840
Okay, I guess, uh...

935
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Let's go talk to the chef.

936
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,800
Beautiful night, isn't it?

937
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,140
When business driving, night always beautiful.

938
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,340
Hey, big guy.

939
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:15,640
Easy!

940
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,620
No time for talk!

941
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,220
Okay!

942
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,000
McCoy, Itazura suruna.

943
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,960
You want something, you talk to me.

944
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,400
Sorry, Howie.

945
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,020
Got to mix more out back.

946
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,740
Speaks Japanese.

947
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
Itazura suruna.

948
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,950
Uh, wait, wasn't there...

949
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,690
Okay, well, this guy looks pretty suspicious with his big old red coat.

950
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,750
McCoy, LPD.

951
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,330
I want to ask you a couple of questions.

952
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,930
Sorry, my man.

953
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,550
I just don't got the time.

954
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,530
Gordos, don't...

955
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,310
He doesn't have the ta...

956
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,350
Wait, really?

957
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,250
Wait, the guy actually left.

958
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,410
Wait, I can go inside.

959
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,150
I'm breaking and entering.

960
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,790
Um...

961
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,770
Wow, nice green goop he got there.

962
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,970
Isn't this supposed to be...

963
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,530
It's literally Chinatown, speaks Japanese.

964
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,240
Okay.

965
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,920
Let's go talk to him.

966
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:24,980
Hello.

967
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,200
Howie says you're a master chef.

968
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,440
You not come back here.

969
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,900
Air bad.

970
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,780
This will only take a minute.

971
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm looking for a girl, about 14 years old, with pink hair.

972
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,180
You seen her?

973
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,340
I don't know her.

974
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,700
Uh-oh.

975
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,920
We're in pursuit?

976
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,380
Oh my god.

977
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,750
Wait, uh...

978
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,100
Okay.

979
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,240
Oh, shoot!

980
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, I'm actually gonna shoot!

981
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,740
Go, go, go!

982
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,080
Oh my god.

983
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,120
Go!

984
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,790
Oh my god.

985
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,410
Uh, I don't think that's our guy.

986
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,050
Oh my gosh, I could just kill a guy, if I wanted.

987
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,890
Holy cow.

988
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:14,750
I'm scared.

989
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,510
What if he shoots me?

990
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,470
I don't see him.

991
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:21,590
I don't see him.

992
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:21,950
I'm Ronan?

993
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,310
Wait, why am I shooting all of a sudden?

994
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,090
All in a day...

995
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,810
Oh, oh my gosh.

996
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,950
I told you, this game is scary, no?

997
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,350
Locked.

998
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,550
Locked.

999
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,510
Is that our guy?

1000
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,490
Because he spilled the soup.

1001
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,060
Maybe I was supposed to shoot that guy.

1002
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,870
Well, uh...

1003
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,890
Too late now.

1004
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,650
Is there anything?

1005
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,170
This way.

1006
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,290
Maybe.

1007
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,890
Was that our guy?

1008
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,090
That wasn't our guy, though!

1009
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,310
Ah.

1010
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,390
Oh.

1011
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,090
Oh, did I break the game?

1012
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,830
Ah.

1013
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,610
Ah.

1014
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:25,630
Ah.

1015
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:26,510
Ah.

1016
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,130
Yeah, didn't...

1017
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,650
He wasn't wearing his little...

1018
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,550
His little...

1019
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,450
Tank top.

1020
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,590
I'm not just gonna shoot a guy.

1021
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:37,450
Ha.

1022
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,830
Maybe we want a taste of the soup.

1023
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,970
BabyCorn, thank you so much for the gift.

1024
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:42,610
And thank you.

1025
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,460
Oh, yeah, okay.

1026
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,280
Huh.

1027
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:00,870
No.

1028
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,660
I need to get inside your home, please!

1029
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,000
Just...

1030
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,200
Just barge on in your LAPD!

1031
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,540
Um...

1032
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,820
Scary?

1033
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:23,800
Blacked.

1034
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,800
Start...

1035
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,120
Wait, can we shoot the lock?

1036
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,640
I don't think we can...

1037
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,900
Oh, no, because it didn't...

1038
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,580
Okay, well, I guess we leave.

1039
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We lost our guy!

1040
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,540
Dang!

1041
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,060
Am I just gonna run around with my gun out?

1042
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
That's kind of scary.

1043
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:47,840
He...

1044
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,340
He...

1045
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,820
He...

1046
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,920
He pulled a fast one on me!

1047
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,040
He spilled the soup!

1048
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,340
God, I love the way people hold their guy's white arm in the air, randomly waving it around.

1049
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,420
Right?

1050
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,320
Well, this is very futuristic, and, uh...

1051
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,800
Honestly, I think we did the people a favor.

1052
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,740
They shouldn't be eating the sludge.

1053
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,640
Oh my god!

1054
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
I still have my gun out!

1055
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,960
I can just shoot anybody I want!

1056
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
Wait, how am I supposed to talk to anybody?

1057
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,260
Wait!

1058
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,400
Right click?

1059
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,120
Oh my gosh!

1060
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:37,900
Thank you!

1061
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,160
Wait, if I left click...

1062
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,740
If I right click again...

1063
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,040
Oh!

1064
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I see!

1065
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,200
Hey, your guy just, um, runs it across...

1066
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,080
It's from your place, isn't it?

1067
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,120
Could be.

1068
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,600
Chopstick come from Yoshi's restaurant supply.

1069
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,540
Yoshi restaurant supply, you say?

1070
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,360
How long has that chef worked for you?

1071
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,540
Zubin?

1072
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,520
Just a month!

1073
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,400
Superior chef makes all kinds of new suits.

1074
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,360
New suits?

1075
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,900
Talk with your gun.

1076
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,420
What's real fresh tonight?

1077
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,380
Special ship in the portal, just the right.

1078
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:14,920
Whoa!

1079
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,320
I'd fix you right up, no one else.

1080
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,420
Thank you!

1081
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,080
Clean as a whistle.

1082
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,640
Oh!

1083
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,480
You're Prince, Howie.

1084
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,880
Aww!

1085
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,580
Really?

1086
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,460
You're gonna make me?

1087
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,240
Oh my gosh, he just gave it to us.

1088
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,840
See you later, Howie.

1089
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,320
Wait, no!

1090
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,480
Okay.

1091
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,820
See you, Howie.

1092
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,900
You're...

1093
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,980
Howie, you have a big mess to clean up back there.

1094
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,220
But I thought fish poison.

1095
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,880
I think they said that it was like some things were...

1096
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,980
Guys, I might be stupid with this game.

1097
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,760
I'm not gonna lie.

1098
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,040
Hold on, let's go back to the animal place.

1099
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,060
There's a lady staring at us.

1100
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,100
Have you guys ever seen that?

1101
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,000
I think it was in Dubai.

1102
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,980
There's like this super big building.

1103
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,160
And then they had...

1104
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
I think it was Rihanna on it.

1105
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,340
But her face was just completely stretched.

1106
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,020
At any time I see those types of buildings, I just think of that.

1107
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,350
Her face was like...

1108
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,290
She's like, hi, I'm Rihanna.

1109
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:29,450
And her face is like crazy looking.

1110
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,450
Well, now we can shoot.

1111
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,650
That's so exciting, no?

1112
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,470
Oh, this place is so creepy with nobody here.

1113
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,430
Oh my gosh.

1114
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,110
I don't think we have anything else to do here.

1115
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,740
It's so creepy!

1116
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,520
Okay, let's leave.

1117
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,840
See, it feels haunted.

1118
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,920
It's a fire hydrant.

1119
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,060
If that place is lo...

1120
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,380
Okay, let's...

1121
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,160
When in doubt, go to the police station.

1122
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,720
They'll tell us what to do.

1123
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:14,420
Right?

1124
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,900
It's possible you can do more with the door when you don't have the gun out.

1125
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,320
Maybe...

1126
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,560
I could try that.

1127
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,420
Review my evidence?

1128
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,300
What do I do?

1129
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,540
I...

1130
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,660
Oh yeah, click on myself.

1131
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:29,480
Wow!

1132
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,040
Okay.

1133
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,800
About 30 counts of animal murder and one of aggravated assault.

1134
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,460
I already checked for a crowbar, some kind of tool.

1135
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,320
Oh yeah, the...

1136
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,300
No luck, but it looks like we've got some lateness.

1137
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,280
Lucy.

1138
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:51,960
Oh!

1139
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,200
Okay, can I look at it?

1140
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:55,800
Nope.

1141
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:57,860
Okay.

1142
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,040
Door forced, graceful footprints.

1143
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,540
Well, we already know what the guy looked like.

1144
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,180
Whereabouts?

1145
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,360
Oh.

1146
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,540
Wow.

1147
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,620
This game is way more...

1148
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,780
My dad did all the things then.

1149
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,080
So excited about 2019!

1150
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,240
We will have flying cars that can speak Japanese.

1151
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,380
They can hold a gun!

1152
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,480
Clues.

1153
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,320
Audio recording.

1154
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,880
Wait, we have...

1155
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh.

1156
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,660
Audio recording.

1157
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,870
We got the chopstick wrapper...

1158
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,970
Candy, that's right.

1159
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,490
Oh, the toy dog.

1160
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:47,990
I don't...

1161
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,810
Is that a clue?

1162
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,030
Is that a clue?

1163
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,330
This thing?

1164
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,930
Why is this a clue?

1165
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,030
It's brown cow candy.

1166
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,490
Howie Lee's in Chinatown.

1167
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,710
I'd eaten there myself.

1168
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,350
Yeah.

1169
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,490
Gosh, it's so loud, that sound effect.

1170
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:10,770
Okay.

1171
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,630
Yeah, 2019 will be our year, guys.

1172
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,030
Roof.

1173
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,290
Mainframe and shooting rings.

1174
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,350
She scared me.

1175
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,810
Wait!

1176
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,670
Mainframe and shooting rings.

1177
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,910
I kind of want to try the shooting rings.

1178
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:34,110
Violent street crime in the city rose again last year by a whopping 26 percent, according to the latest figures from the Department of Justice.

1179
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:39,190
Governor Kulvig attributed the change to the dramatic increase in the number of specials.

1180
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:41,170
28.

1181
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,970
Oh wait, we're McCoy.

1182
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,970
Oh, we haven't tried at all.

1183
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:53,270
Registered as city residents and promised a tough new set of standards for the city immigration bureau by next month.

1184
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,090
Old copies of case files, notices, and memos.

1185
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,590
The usual station junk.

1186
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,870
This place is a dump.

1187
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,590
Where is the shooting range?

1188
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,150
Oh wait, it probably is this side, huh?

1189
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,070
Well, if it ain't Ray McCoy, Bryant finally letting you play with the big boys.

1190
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,610
My clearance come through?

1191
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,730
You bet.

1192
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,870
You bring your piece?

1193
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,390
Don't leave home without it.

1194
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:14,070
What's the piece?

1195
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,450
Steel's been running the maze every other day for two weeks.

1196
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,670
And the targets are getting a little roughed up.

1197
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,950
Yeah, Deckard kind of sucks.

1198
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,630
I thought Guzer was going to reposition some new ones.

1199
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:21,970
He got only 10 points.

1200
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,690
I ain't seen him in a better than a month.

1201
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,750
We're going to sweep him.

1202
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,910
And everybody else.

1203
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,110
Poor guy.

1204
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,890
I bet he gets all tuckered out from pushing those papers around.

1205
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,530
Oh.

1206
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,030
And don't sell him short, McCoy.

1207
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,830
Slang for gun.

1208
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,530
Guzer could be one tough hombre.

1209
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,910
I remember when we worked vice together.

1210
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:42,130
He poured acetone on two pimps that gave us some lip and lit a match.

1211
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,110
I'll tell you, it looked like the goddamn 4th of July out there.

1212
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,690
Peachy.

1213
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,050
That guy.

1214
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,730
He'll just set you on fire.

1215
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,270
Laughs.

1216
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,930
Laughs in red.

1217
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,970
What is this?

1218
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:58,870
What is that?

1219
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,230
What in the umineko is this?

1220
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,200
Okay.

1221
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,120
Um, well, hold on.

1222
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,120
I want to go to the shooting range.

1223
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,760
This is the shooting range, right?

1224
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,700
What is this?

1225
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,920
Hey.

1226
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,240
Use the esper for the first time.

1227
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,300
Esper late than never.

1228
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,540
What is this?

1229
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,340
Nothing is being explained to me.

1230
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,940
I can't even click anything.

1231
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,940
Nothing comes up.

1232
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,500
Am I using it?

1233
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,220
I'm clearly not using it correctly.

1234
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,480
Uploading personal clue database.

1235
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,380
Very 90s.

1236
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,980
Downloading mainframe clue database.

1237
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,260
I think we're doing it.

1238
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,740
Okay.

1239
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,300
Clue database transfer complete.

1240
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:49,980
All right.

1241
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,920
Cool.

1242
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,080
Bicep.

1243
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,560
Okay.

1244
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,260
Where's the shooting range?

1245
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,860
Okay, Esper room.

1246
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,450
Someone's cigarette.

1247
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,890
Lucky strikes.

1248
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,030
Crystal's brand.

1249
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,010
I knew she was spending a lot of time in the training maze these days.

1250
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,490
Even though she'd already gotten close to a perfect score.

1251
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:21,770
Where...

1252
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,490
Where is it?

1253
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,370
Am I stupid?

1254
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,610
It's not this door.

1255
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:36,970
Maybe it is...

1256
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,130
Maybe it's through here.

1257
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,490
Hello, I would like to try...

1258
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,510
You keeping busy, pal?

1259
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,230
Pale.

1260
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,630
Nah, the place has been pretty quiet the last couple of days.

1261
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,290
2019 is confusing.

1262
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,790
Where's the shooting range, please, sir?

1263
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:53,610
Oh, wait.

1264
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,650
Hit the lock, Jack.

1265
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,590
I guess there ain't no harm in it.

1266
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,810
Yippee!

1267
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,010
Oh my gosh!

1268
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,170
This area!

1269
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,270
I remember this so much.

1270
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,630
Okay.

1271
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,250
Wait, how do I do that?

1272
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,490
I'm scared.

1273
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:18,210
Oh

1274
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,940
my gosh, I got shot at!

1275
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,040
That seems...

1276
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,540
I can't tell.

1277
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,580
That looked like a lady.

1278
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,140
Ow!

1279
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:27,860
Wow!

1280
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,540
Oh, oops.

1281
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,500
I shot a lady.

1282
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,770
Did I get it?

1283
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,190
Did I?

1284
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:38,930
Oh, I see.

1285
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,790
I have to wait to see if they have a gun or not.

1286
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,070
Ouch!

1287
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:42,490
Ouch!

1288
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,210
Ouch!

1289
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,070
I'm shooting him!

1290
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:45,450
Shoot him!

1291
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,310
Shoot him!

1292
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:46,770
Shoot him!

1293
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,450
Shoot him!

1294
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,850
Okay, this is going to go really well for us now, isn't it?

1295
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:55,110
Oh, yeah.

1296
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:55,850
Oh, yeah.

1297
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,730
I'm a killing machine.

1298
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,060
Oh, shoot!

1299
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,740
How did I...

1300
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,300
I couldn't see if she had a gun or not.

1301
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:10,580
Yeah.

1302
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,140
Completed sequence.

1303
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,380
Proceed to next station.

1304
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,100
Did I win?

1305
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,580
Oh, where's the next station?

1306
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,140
Where?

1307
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,280
This way?

1308
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,860
I won again.

1309
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,460
Nope.

1310
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,080
We're still going.

1311
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,360
Got my gun out.

1312
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,340
Holy sh...

1313
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:39,520
Ow!

1314
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,280
Holy cow!

1315
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,540
Oh, there's people everywhere!

1316
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,900
Oh!

1317
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,000
Oh my god.

1318
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:48,960
Ow!

1319
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:49,540
I shot you!

1320
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,320
No, I didn't.

1321
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:50,940
Oh, that's a baby.

1322
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,460
Oh my gosh.

1323
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,540
We're killing machines.

1324
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,240
We're killing machines!

1325
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,540
I'm going to beat Deckard and his...

1326
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,660
and everything.

1327
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,280
That's a baby.

1328
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,790
Baby with a gun.

1329
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,630
Oh my gosh, I definitely clicked.

1330
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,290
But it didn't register it!

1331
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,230
Oh my gosh.

1332
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:29,950
No, I'm running!

1333
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,250
Why?

1334
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,070
Stop, stop running!

1335
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,930
Stop running.

1336
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,990
Why are you running?

1337
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:38,450
Is that guy...

1338
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,230
Completed sequence.

1339
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,530
Proceed to next station.

1340
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:42,970
The baby with a gun.

1341
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:45,690
Okay.

1342
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,220
Okay.

1343
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:50,740
Wow.

1344
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,140
All right.

1345
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,020
All right.

1346
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,240
I'm ready.

1347
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,360
Freddy.

1348
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,440
I'm not ready.

1349
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,260
I'm scared.

1350
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,920
Oh my god.

1351
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,030
Guys, I don't know if I'm...

1352
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,010
Oh, that was a baby.

1353
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:11,490
Sorry.

1354
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,800
I can't tell.

1355
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,960
That's a gun.

1356
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,960
That's a gun.

1357
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,970
The baby with a gun.

1358
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,170
Oh, I got him.

1359
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,290
Completed sequence.

1360
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,830
Holy cow.

1361
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:44,530
Proceed to next station.

1362
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:45,710
I'm killing babies!

1363
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,550
Your personality.

1364
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,370
Definitely erratic.

1365
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,280
Where's the next station, ma'am?

1366
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,440
Do I go back?

1367
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,140
Completed sequence.

1368
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:03,760
No.

1369
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,460
Proceed to next station.

1370
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,620
Next station.

1371
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,420
I wonder what our score is.

1372
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,180
Probably max.

1373
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,020
Um.

1374
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,080
Where do I go from here?

1375
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,100
Completed sequence.

1376
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,360
Proceed to next station.

1377
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,480
I wonder what our score is.

1378
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,360
I found it.

1379
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:32,530
Run.

1380
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:32,930
Run.

1381
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,120
Run.

1382
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,480
That's a baby.

1383
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,360
Oh my god.

1384
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,160
I got you.

1385
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:44,720
Kill.

1386
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,260
Kill.

1387
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:45,980
Kill.

1388
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,520
That's a baby.

1389
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,060
That's a baby.

1390
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,040
Ew.

1391
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,950
Guys, what do you think my score is?

1392
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,110
What do you think my score is?

1393
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:06,590
That's a baby.

1394
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,250
That's a baby.

1395
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,610
That's a baby.

1396
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,240
Completed all sequences.

1397
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,220
Damn, that was a good run.

1398
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,110
At least.

1399
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,450
Oh.

1400
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,230
Proceed to exit.

1401
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,250
Completed sequence.

1402
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,690
Proceed to next station.

1403
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,230
Not bad.

1404
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,250
Not bad.

1405
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:27,610
Wrong one.

1406
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,750
I think we got the top score.

1407
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:31,890
I think we got the top score.

1408
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,710
Completed all sequences.

1409
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,890
Proceed to exit.

1410
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,330
Why is it so wet in here?

1411
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,640
Yippee!

1412
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,480
Get the first place!

1413
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,720
No way!

1414
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,760
Old copies of case files, notices, and mail.

1415
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,350
Oh, we just barely did it.

1416
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:07,310
We just barely beat Steely.

1417
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,690
I almost got 69 for real.

1418
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,070
Nice.

1419
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,810
I'm a shooting queen.

1420
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,310
Nah, take that everybody else on the team.

1421
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,530
We're so ready for...

1422
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,430
Wait, where'd my...

1423
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,370
Okay, I was like, where'd my cursor go?

1424
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,190
Oh, oh, right.

1425
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,170
We were playing the game.

1426
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,090
Round floor.

1427
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,250
Mainframe and shooting.

1428
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:37,810
Laboratory.

1429
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,050
Laboratory.

1430
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:39,670
Roof.

1431
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,830
I like the way she says roof.

1432
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:42,890
Roof.

1433
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,330
Roof.

1434
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:45,650
Loved old point and clicks.

1435
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,010
The style reminds me of the longest journey game.

1436
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,130
I don't know that one.

1437
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:51,310
Epic shooting.

1438
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:51,810
First try.

1439
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,390
Let's go, baby.

1440
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,550
I'm Officer Wisp.

1441
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,830
We think you'd fit right in.

1442
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:01,590
Thank you!

1443
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,550
I only shoot babies sometimes.

1444
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,670
Let's try going back to Chinatown.

1445
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,750
And seeing maybe if we can do something.

1446
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:17,930
If my gun isn't out.

1447
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,770
Off world.

1448
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,990
All right.

1449
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:25,330
Oh, look.

1450
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:26,310
Wait, there's somebody here.

1451
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:27,790
Was that guy here before?

1452
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,330
Oh, I can't talk to them.

1453
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:33,910
Nope.

1454
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,430
What have you been doing this whole time, my guy?

1455
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,990
I think I should have shot that guy.

1456
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,590
Dang it!

1457
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,310
I have one chance to...

1458
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,210
Wait, I can search in here.

1459
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:58,870
I found a clue!

1460
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,490
What was that?

1461
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:02,930
I found...

1462
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,710
Nothing even remotely interesting, but hell.

1463
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,890
If I was going to root through trash, my expectations weren't too high.

1464
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:08,710
I got something.

1465
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,750
I don't know what it is.

1466
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:12,590
Huh.

1467
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,690
A license plate?

1468
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,510
It came and went so quickly.

1469
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,690
Totally uninteresting.

1470
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,770
Okay, then why'd you have me click on it?

1471
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,250
Totally uninteresting.

1472
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,510
Okay, my bad.

1473
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,530
Totally uninteresting.

1474
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,030
Totally uninteresting.

1475
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:31,150
What about this?

1476
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,590
It's totally uninteresting, too.

1477
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,550
Yuck.

1478
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,430
Yuck!

1479
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,090
Like, totally uninteresting.

1480
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:42,590
Like...

1481
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,050
The way he goes up the stairs is so funny.

1482
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,420
I don't see anything that click.

1483
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,000
Locked.

1484
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:58,980
Locked.

1485
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,020
Locked.

1486
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,440
I proposed to my girlfriend on Friday.

1487
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,420
She said, yes!

1488
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,560
You are!

1489
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,340
Oh my gosh!

1490
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,460
Congratulations!

1491
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:08,900
Wait.

1492
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,820
It would mean the world to her if you said hi to my wife, Theodora!

1493
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,260
Hello, Theodora!

1494
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,200
Congratulations!

1495
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,680
On our marriage.

1496
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,080
Our marriage.

1497
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,260
Our proposal.

1498
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,580
Okay, well we just got that thing.

1499
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,580
We got the license plate.

1500
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,140
Maybe we go run it, you know?

1501
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,260
Maybe we go back to the...

1502
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,980
We go back to the police station and we run the numbers.

1503
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,440
Maybe.

1504
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,980
I thought it was always that if someone is like, I'm getting married.

1505
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,140
Here's my wife.

1506
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,560
I thought it was always obvious that it was our wife.

1507
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,080
I thought that was just, you know, common sense.

1508
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,320
Boss, you shot a baby.

1509
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:27,700
Amazing.

1510
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,580
That right there is why you're the best, boss.

1511
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,280
Okay.

1512
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,040
Let's go run some numbers.

1513
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,780
Why am I walking so slow?

1514
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,080
Okay.

1515
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,660
You didn't know anything about this?

1516
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,180
See you later, Howie.

1517
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,060
Bye, Howie.

1518
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,740
Excuse me, pal.

1519
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,120
Excuse me, pal.

1520
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,480
Come here.

1521
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,400
Excuse me.

1522
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,560
You got anything that's a match for these?

1523
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,800
McCoy, LPD.

1524
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,500
Nobody respects you.

1525
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:01,940
Why?

1526
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,400
I wonder what the enhanced version looks like.

1527
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,300
I feel like this looks just totally fine, no?

1528
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,090
Like, this looks great.

1529
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,030
Oh, he did a little 360.

1530
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,570
Does that mean Firefly is your wife too?

1531
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,810
Stop coping, ducky.

1532
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,730
Is running with blades OSHA compliant?

1533
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:37,350
Yeah.

1534
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,260
Okay.

1535
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,620
Where do we go to run a plate?

1536
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:44,220
Laboratory.

1537
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,280
The laboratory.

1538
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:46,920
Lockup.

1539
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,200
Lockup?

1540
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:48,860
Who's in there?

1541
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,760
Ground floor.

1542
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,860
Mainframe and shooting range.

1543
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,280
What does mainframe mean?

1544
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,200
Laboratory.

1545
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,440
Let's try the laboratory.

1546
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,780
Whoa, there's so many wanted posters.

1547
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:05,600
Hello?

1548
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,860
Got anything new for me, Dino?

1549
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,200
I was wondering when you'd show your mug around here, McCoy.

1550
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,040
Hello.

1551
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,280
We got the animal corpses from Runciter's, but there wasn't a whole lot to work with.

1552
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,500
Bone marrow?

1553
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,180
About 50% were real, the rest were fakes.

1554
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,720
So, Runciter was ripping his customers off.

1555
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,880
Wow, what a surprise.

1556
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,120
State of the art fakes.

1557
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,400
Miles beyond the crap you see on Anemoid Row.

1558
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,960
The kind that comes from legit manufacturers?

1559
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,740
They're the ones that usually produce the quality.

1560
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,200
What about the wounds?

1561
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,440
Most of them were shot point blank, but we're looking at some others.

1562
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,500
Sloppy cuts with a knife.

1563
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,620
Like the perp was really pissed off at something.

1564
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:41,860
Butcher knife?

1565
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,280
Could be, but who cuts meat anymore?

1566
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,920
Nice bunch of reps I'm tailin'.

1567
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,800
Hope you're not pulling a meat cleaver out of my back next week.

1568
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,100
Stay hydrated, thank you, I have been.

1569
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,480
Hmm...

1570
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:54,960
Nasty!

1571
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,820
Anything else?

1572
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,460
That black paint you found on the fire hydrant?

1573
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,280
It's from a ground car.

1574
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,540
You sure?

1575
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,040
The angle of impact was almost head on.

1576
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:13,440
And there ain't too many spinner drivers klutzy enough to smack a street level hydrant in VTOL mode.

1577
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,820
I heard your wife got her license back.

1578
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,360
Heh, you're a real funny guy, McCoy.

1579
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:19,880
What?

1580
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,460
Are we still looking for the animal killer?

1581
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,480
Y-yes?

1582
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,080
Anything else?

1583
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,840
Oh, yeah.

1584
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,130
That piece of chrome you found outside of Runcidas is from a 1995 Pontiac.

1585
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,400
Nice set of wheels.

1586
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,720
It's okay, not what I call a classic.

1587
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,160
Well, it's classic now.

1588
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,440
Retro.

1589
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,340
Anything else?

1590
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,020
Anything else?

1591
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,600
Zip man, try me later.

1592
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,180
Okay, thank you.

1593
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,540
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing in this game.

1594
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,920
But I'm having fun.

1595
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,660
I have no idea what's going on.

1596
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,860
Mainframe and shooting range.

1597
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,860
Maybe we try here with the...

1598
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,940
Shut up.

1599
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,980
Maybe the license plate is working now.

1600
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,540
Downloading mainframe clue data...

1601
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,880
Clue database transfer complete.

1602
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,400
Okay.

1603
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,660
This thing sucks.

1604
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,360
It's broken!

1605
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,100
Esper machine!

1606
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,580
Just give it a good couple of whacks.

1607
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,920
I don't understand.

1608
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,480
Okay.

1609
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,940
We just have to be smart, I guess.

1610
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,480
Um...

1611
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,900
Maybe he knows.

1612
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,300
You keeping busy, pal?

1613
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,400
Nah, the place has been pretty quiet the last couple of days.

1614
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,140
Okay.

1615
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,700
We missed the camera discs.

1616
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:00,520
Hm?

1617
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,940
We missed something.

1618
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,860
Where at?

1619
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,620
I think this game is, not gonna lie, pretty easy to miss things at.

1620
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,360
You needed the security footage...

1621
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,520
See, I tried to!

1622
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,540
Wait, really?

1623
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,420
But I tried to get...

1624
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:18,580
I...

1625
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,180
I hovered over it, but nothing happened.

1626
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,240
Okay, let's go again.

1627
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,740
Consult the manual.

1628
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,560
Right?

1629
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,760
Oh my gosh.

1630
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,640
This is actually, like, the era of gaming where...

1631
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,660
Oh, no!

1632
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,360
Not Chinatown!

1633
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,840
I'm stupid.

1634
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:40,280
But this is the era of gaming where they were like, Yeah, people read the manual and it actually was the tutorial for the game.

1635
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,180
I

1636
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,340
didn't mean to come back here.

1637
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,060
I'm obsessed with the sushi.

1638
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,120
I'm obsessed with the... with Chinatown sushi.

1639
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,240
Call Campbell.

1640
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,060
That sushi.

1641
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,840
Okay.

1642
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:07,710
Well, maybe...

1643
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,120
Because no one's here, maybe we can go into that back room also.

1644
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:19,620
Let's get some security footage, baby!

1645
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,380
I clicked on it before, no?

1646
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,560
Security camera.

1647
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,120
It'd be a banner day if it recorded anything before it was shot out.

1648
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,640
Right?

1649
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,800
So, grab it.

1650
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,220
I don't like this area, it spooks me.

1651
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,950
See, all I got is monkey.

1652
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,550
There's nothing else in here.

1653
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,430
Wait, how am I supposed to get it?

1654
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,060
Was there somewhere else that I didn't click on?

1655
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,920
There's nothing... nowhere to go on the sides.

1656
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,320
Cell type!

1657
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,160
Happy birthday!

1658
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,400
Happy, happy birthday!

1659
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,020
What do you mean, bother me?

1660
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,060
You're never... it's never a bother.

1661
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,220
Thank you, lad.

1662
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,780
Thank you for the super tie.

1663
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,100
Happy belated birthday!

1664
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,800
Try the desk?

1665
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,640
Yeah, I tried.

1666
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,980
Nothing there.

1667
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:37,990
Security camera.

1668
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,550
It'd be a banner day if it recorded anything before it was shot out.

1669
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,730
I'm struggling here.

1670
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,180
That's why I was like, I thought I...

1671
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,080
Wait, wait.

1672
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,460
Wait, I saw blue?

1673
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,060
Oh.

1674
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,320
Because of this area.

1675
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,020
Yeah, there's no way to get past the curtain.

1676
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,460
Now we have to ask the guy for the footage.

1677
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,280
But where is he?

1678
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,060
Is he being locked up?

1679
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,840
Is he held downtown?

1680
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,080
Ask the guy for the footage.

1681
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,480
Shoot the camera?

1682
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,180
Ha ha ha ha.

1683
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,420
You need...

1684
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,280
Run sitter here for this.

1685
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,330
But he's not here.

1686
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,030
Uh oh.

1687
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,990
You can't get softlocked in this game.

1688
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,170
I clicked on that though!

1689
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:39,630
I did!

1690
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,070
I clicked on the security camera before I talked to him.

1691
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,320
Maybe we go home and take a nap.

1692
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:55,640
Did you?

1693
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,080
I did.

1694
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,720
I clicked it.

1695
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,020
Let's go home and take a nap.

1696
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,760
Maybe our virtual girlfriends then.

1697
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,780
Did they arrest him for his animals dying?

1698
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,080
What if they arrested him because some of his animals were fake?

1699
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,920
That could be the case.

1700
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,180
Right?

1701
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,960
How do I get inside my home?

1702
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:19,880
Home?

1703
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:20,220
Oh.

1704
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,310
You can misplot elements but you can't get into unwinnables.

1705
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:29,650
Oh!

1706
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:44,700
Oh!

1707
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,740
There's a guy walking.

1708
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,720
Very slowly but I can't do anything.

1709
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,780
Rumor has it you've been earning your stripes, McCoy.

1710
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,180
I just shot that guy!

1711
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,680
Oh my god!

1712
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,020
Working on it.

1713
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,200
Keep it up.

1714
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,020
You just might have a future in this business.

1715
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:04,780
Did you see that?

1716
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,580
I understand it's got a hell of a retirement plan.

1717
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,040
You'll VK the mark before retirement?

1718
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,340
You're not gonna address it?

1719
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:11,920
Didn't have to.

1720
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,420
That's why they call it the magic.

1721
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,220
I'm starting to understand.

1722
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,160
If you ever retire a human, your career is over.

1723
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:21,860
Remember that.

1724
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:22,760
What?

1725
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,940
I checked with UN Air.

1726
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,940
Looks your rep swung that Moonbust massacre last month.

1727
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,740
I was supposed to shoot him though, right?

1728
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,720
He was ambushing me at my own home!

1729
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,400
You disappeared into thin air.

1730
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,820
Brian thinks it crashed out in the kipple.

1731
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,040
How many reps are we talking about?

1732
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:38,980
Enough.

1733
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,740
They're Nexus Sixes.

1734
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,760
So don't take too much slap.

1735
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,260
I should pay attention.

1736
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:45,000
Oh my gosh.

1737
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:47,800
What?

1738
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,400
Who...

1739
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,280
What just happened?

1740
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,830
Okay.

1741
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:02,810
Alright.

1742
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,770
Yuck.

1743
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,960
Atom Man, you just killed!

1744
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:14,440
Yuck.

1745
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,390
This game is ridiculous!

1746
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:23,730
What?

1747
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,830
He was coming at me!

1748
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,310
Was I supposed to let it happen?

1749
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,170
I don't know!

1750
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,490
I don't know!

1751
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,230
That's me.

1752
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,110
Unloads your entire gun on one man.

1753
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,010
I see her in your stripes.

1754
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,890
The future of 2019 is often folks running...

1755
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,030
I lived with the best gal I'd ever seen.

1756
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,470
She was two now and full of life and love.

1757
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:58,190
She'd cost me about a year's salary, but she was worth it.

1758
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,590
Oh, your dog!

1759
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:01,530
It was good to have someone warm nearby after completing a dirty job.

1760
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:04,870
And the retirement swag from this case would go toward getting her a partner.

1761
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:05,770
Swag.

1762
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:08,290
Wait.

1763
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:09,550
Your dog?

1764
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,490
Maggie, come here, girl.

1765
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,910
Oh, Maggie!

1766
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,170
So cute!

1767
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:23,630
What about our robot girlfriend?

1768
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,170
Where is she at?

1769
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,050
She's on here on the telly?

1770
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,250
Oh, it's the aspirin machine!

1771
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,690
Get this shit out of here!

1772
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,570
I hate this thing!

1773
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,360
Here you go, baby.

1774
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,160
Dinner time.

1775
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,240
Oh, yeah!

1776
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,240
Can we pet the dog?

1777
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,320
Maggie, come here, girl.

1778
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,140
Pet the dog.

1779
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,100
Here you go, baby.

1780
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:46,920
Dinner time.

1781
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,880
Here you go, baby!

1782
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,510
Wow, this place is so...

1783
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:58,350
Wow.

1784
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,990
Zubin was the first Nexus 6 I'd come up against.

1785
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,350
There was something in his eyes.

1786
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:06,590
An almost primordial desire to live.

1787
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:10,030
Most of the threes, fours, and fives I'd seen would just give up.

1788
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:10,670
That was the guy we shot.

1789
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,650
But these sixes, they were a whole other breed.

1790
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,730
You saw the look in his eye?

1791
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:17,650
I don't know, you said yuck!

1792
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,610
You looked at his body and you said yuck!

1793
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,030
There was like a look in his eye to live.

1794
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,830
As you unloaded your gun on him?

1795
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,830
Yeah, we didn't report it or anything!

1796
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,250
Primordial and yucky.

1797
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,310
I was gonna say, is this the bathroom?

1798
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,490
I thought we would customize our appearance a little bit.

1799
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,710
Hey, you can use the toilet in this game.

1800
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:49,950
Can we sleep?

1801
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:52,330
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

1802
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,230
Oh!

1803
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,510
It's been one of those days.

1804
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,510
Reach Act 2!

1805
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:58,930
Are we dreaming?

1806
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,110
What is happening?

1807
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,230
What?

1808
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:13,710
Oh my god, we're going into the anti-gravity room.

1809
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:16,470
Oh no.

1810
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,110
It's about a third of what we got here on Terra.

1811
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,910
Why are you letting the pets just float in space?

1812
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,070
How about turning that dial, okay?

1813
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,150
When I say...

1814
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:27,430
Oh!

1815
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,210
Oh!

1816
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:28,850
Oh!

1817
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,190
Please...

1818
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:33,010
Can you control your rat?

1819
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:37,390
I'll have you know that Ricky's a purebred chihuahua.

1820
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:38,730
Chihuahua?

1821
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,330
Things going good at Tyrell Corporation?

1822
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,570
Boring, boring.

1823
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:47,750
Old man Tyrell's been on a Vagma kick lately.

1824
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,290
He never shuts up.

1825
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,870
I'm nervous about Maggie in this game, not gonna lie.

1826
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,250
Me too.

1827
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,910
Dang, this guy is nosy.

1828
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,210
Chihuahua.

1829
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:15,690
Chihuahua.

1830
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,150
This guy, I don't think he's wearing pants.

1831
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:18,670
Chihuahua.

1832
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,270
I hope he's wearing pants.

1833
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:27,050
Oh!

1834
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,850
She's this game's autogon.

1835
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:43,650
Tell me something I don't know.

1836
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,570
The organ designers.

1837
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:48,670
Miraji, Hannibal Chu, Luther and Lance.

1838
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,970
They're closer to him than I am.

1839
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,370
Where?

1840
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,330
What a name.

1841
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,350
DNA Row.

1842
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,650
Hannibal Chu human.

1843
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:57,230
They're all working down on DNA Row.

1844
01:17:58,710 --> 01:17:59,950
No, no, no.

1845
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,450
You're one miserable package man.

1846
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:02,910
No.

1847
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,470
No, please don't.

1848
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,210
Oh, right in the...

1849
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:08,750
Whoa!

1850
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,870
That was a weird dream.

1851
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:14,270
Pick up.

1852
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,810
Hope you aren't camped out there with a bottle of tequila.

1853
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:19,490
Very funny.

1854
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,290
Whatever that is.

1855
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,190
Early bird slays the worm, McCoy.

1856
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:23,530
Don't worry.

1857
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,370
I'm up, Lieutenant.

1858
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,150
What's the buzz?

1859
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,070
She-huah-huah.

1860
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:31,170
One of Tyrell's employees got his fat face splattered all over the marble interior of the Tyrell building.

1861
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,490
Inside?

1862
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:33,570
Inside?

1863
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,190
That's right.

1864
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,550
But we also got a sweet little break at it.

1865
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:40,070
Tyrell's surveillance system recorded the whole shebang.

1866
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,050
She-bang.

1867
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,510
Beautiful.

1868
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:42,350
How many perps?

1869
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:43,570
Just one.

1870
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:43,770
Just one.

1871
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,570
I don't know if it's related to the Run Center deal or not.

1872
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,970
Tyrell's security will have a disc for you when you get there.

1873
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:50,370
Okay.

1874
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:51,410
You'll be good, killer.

1875
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:52,170
Thank you.

1876
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:55,810
Mm-hmm.

1877
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,960
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

1878
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,300
Wait, no, no.

1879
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,140
Don't go back to sleep.

1880
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,080
Wake up!

1881
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:04,500
No!

1882
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,360
Oh, shoot.

1883
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,040
Okay, we're fine.

1884
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:08,860
Okay.

1885
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:09,960
Alright.

1886
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,380
Very good.

1887
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:13,800
Maggie!

1888
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,600
Maggie, come here, girl.

1889
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,720
Maggie is so cute.

1890
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,960
I worry for Maggie, too.

1891
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,340
Nothing better happen to Maggie.

1892
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,400
Maggie.

1893
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,220
Maggie's our little baby.

1894
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,020
Also, Maggie barks a lot, actually.

1895
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,220
This is why I can't have dogs.

1896
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,080
Do androids dream of electric freaks?

1897
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:34,480
Yeah.

1898
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,560
Wow, there really isn't anything in our house to interact with.

1899
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,280
That kind of sucks.

1900
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,980
What if I go to the ground floor?

1901
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,780
I'm just curious.

1902
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,080
Ground floor.

1903
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,580
Because obviously our car was on the roof.

1904
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,420
So...

1905
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:55,440
Whoa.

1906
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,120
Ew.

1907
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:03,260
We're just awkwardly standing here.

1908
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,540
Whoa.

1909
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,840
I like the...

1910
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,180
This whole game looks so cool.

1911
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:15,920
Oh, wait.

1912
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,740
We can get to the police station from here?

1913
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,060
I can see my house from here.

1914
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,160
So...

1915
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,500
2019.

1916
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,700
Look at him go.

1917
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,360
Hi,

1918
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:33,250
here we are.

1919
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:34,710
Can I talk to anybody?

1920
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,050
Oh, that's the elevator, I guess.

1921
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:38,350
What's this?

1922
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:40,090
Click.

1923
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:40,850
What do you know?

1924
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:42,210
What do you care?

1925
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,370
Who are you?

1926
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:44,970
Who are you?

1927
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:45,950
You're just a person.

1928
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:48,650
You're the only one I can talk to.

1929
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,150
What's her name?

1930
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:52,670
Hey, pal.

1931
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,390
Hey, talk to me.

1932
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,070
Hey.

1933
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:57,650
Hey.

1934
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,670
You killed anyone yet?

1935
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,710
Oh, it's Gaff.

1936
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,390
Yeah, I did actually.

1937
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:02,970
I did kill a person.

1938
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:03,870
What do you know?

1939
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,610
Zero that would interest you, detective.

1940
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:09,530
Okay, thanks, Officer Grifford.

1941
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:11,110
Wait, what's over here?

1942
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,890
I'm just exploring a little bit.

1943
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,530
I know we gotta go to the Tyrell building.

1944
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,610
I'm just taking a look around.

1945
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:21,710
Oh, it's this guy!

1946
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:23,510
Hey, I killed a guy.

1947
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,810
Money?

1948
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,630
Can the department float me some chin yen?

1949
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,330
This investigation's getting expensive.

1950
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,630
Look, this ain't on the department tab, okay?

1951
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,050
This is a personal loan.

1952
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:33,290
Oh.

1953
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:34,830
Thanks, Lieutenant.

1954
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,830
This goddamn city don't know how to manage funds.

1955
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,510
They haven't been flushed for years.

1956
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,790
Huh?

1957
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,670
I thought we were under budget.

1958
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,950
Trust me, ain't nobody getting rich unless they're sneaking some on the side.

1959
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:49,010
Hell, I can barely pay for the fuel for my car.

1960
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,310
Ever hear of public transportation?

1961
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:52,450
Aw.

1962
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:55,150
Get out of here before I throw my desk at you.

1963
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,010
Aw.

1964
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:56,110
Aw.

1965
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,270
Bryant, go on permanent leave and you get full use of the office, Lieutenant?

1966
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:06,250
You'd be amazed at how accommodating a man can be after his hemorrhoids get lanced.

1967
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:09,190
You've really been surprising the troops around here, kid.

1968
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,530
I know, I'm doing a good job.

1969
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:12,350
Gaff says you work their retirement like a champ.

1970
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:14,250
Just doing the job.

1971
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,130
Yeah, well, don't get too cocky.

1972
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:18,730
Those sixes can be damn unpredictable.

1973
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,070
Not the hemorrhoids.

1974
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,010
That, I know.

1975
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,130
But I'm proud of you, McCoy.

1976
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,150
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?

1977
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:26,510
Thanks.

1978
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:27,310
Wait, no.

1979
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:29,670
Famous is writing the advance to your account as we speak.

1980
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,050
What?

1981
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:31,050
How much?

1982
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,690
Couple hundred chin-yen.

1983
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:34,390
Enough to buy a sandwich or two.

1984
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:37,650
We gotta hold back the rest until the lab does the autopsy.

1985
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:39,290
Wait, but I'm supposed to go like...

1986
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:39,890
Paperwork, you know.

1987
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,870
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.

1988
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,230
So, the check's in the mail.

1989
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,170
Hey, don't worry.

1990
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:49,210
The boys upstairs wanna keep our best and brightest happy.

1991
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,290
Any idea what you wanna spend it on?

1992
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:54,010
Yeah, we just woke up, but it's perpetually night here.

1993
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:54,490
And I was thinking...

1994
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,570
Maybe a companion for my animal at home.

1995
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:57,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1996
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,290
Forget that.

1997
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,030
Buy yourself something.

1998
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,450
Something nice.

1999
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,350
Yeah, a companion would be nice.

2000
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:06,650
Once you start carving up that juicy bacon, kid, the taste never goes away.

2001
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:11,690
The great things in life, believe me, you'll just be wanting more and more.

2002
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:12,510
Bacon.

2003
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:14,710
Okay.

2004
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,810
Well, I'm gonna take the rest of the day off then.

2005
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,310
What the heck?

2006
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:20,970
Um, okay.

2007
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:25,510
We have to go to our car, so we can't stay here.

2008
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:27,470
Forget what.

2009
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,190
That dog is everything to McCoy.

2010
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:29,670
Yeah!

2011
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,130
Look at him running.

2012
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,990
Um, how do I get home?

2013
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:36,790
This way?

2014
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,470
Wait, so is this the ground floor?

2015
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:41,570
Where are we?

2016
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,450
This place is confusing.

2017
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,870
We can't go to the right.

2018
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,590
So that just leads to...

2019
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,630
This looks like something will come out of...

2020
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,030
Your floor number, please.

2021
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:53,470
No, please.

2022
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:54,530
We're going to the roof.

2023
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,250
Roof.

2024
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,810
Roof.

2025
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:59,450
Roof.

2026
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:00,590
Roof.

2027
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:01,990
Roof.

2028
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,430
Roof.

2029
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,810
Roof.

2030
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,110
Roof.

2031
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,330
Roof.

2032
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:08,190
Roof.

2033
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,710
Roof.

2034
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:09,270
Roof.

2035
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:09,370
Roof.

2036
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:09,770
Roof.

2037
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:13,690
Roof.

2038
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:14,870
It's the dog button.

2039
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:20,270
Okay, we're... Oh, somebody cleaned up that guy!

2040
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,190
Nice going.

2041
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:24,150
Cleanup crew.

2042
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,130
XOF out here.

2043
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:30,490
Okay.

2044
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:33,450
Not yet.

2045
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,910
Oh, wow, there's the title.

2046
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,270
Well, before we do that, we're going to go back to Run-Sitters.

2047
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,570
And see if that guy's there.

2048
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,210
If we can somehow get the security.

2049
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,310
If not, then we go to Tyrell.

2050
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,170
We just call it a loss, I guess.

2051
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,330
I feel like there's got to be something, though, that we missed.

2052
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:52,530
Or like...

2053
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:55,770
I feel like I remember getting it when my dad played.

2054
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,530
And us...

2055
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,190
Locked.

2056
01:24:59,050 --> 01:24:59,490
Locked?!

2057
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,450
What do you mean?!

2058
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,210
Okay.

2059
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,450
Skull Face is covering for McCoy.

2060
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,860
There we go.

2061
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:18,620
Yuck.

2062
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,420
Door locked?

2063
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,140
Yuck.

2064
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,780
What is awful?

2065
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,080
Whoa!

2066
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,940
L.A.'s on fire!

2067
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:35,910
Tyrell pyramids.

2068
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:38,870
McCoy, LPD.

2069
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:39,550
Hello.

2070
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:40,530
Just a minute.

2071
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:41,650
Where do I go?

2072
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,670
Grab test on the east wing.

2073
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:44,730
66th floor.

2074
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:45,490
66th floor.

2075
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:47,730
Here's the footage from the security cameras.

2076
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:48,230
Thank you!

2077
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,230
You get a pretty good look at the man's face.

2078
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,770
All right!

2079
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,150
How'd he get past you guys?

2080
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:54,710
He pretended to be a delivery man.

2081
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,350
Oh, my gosh.

2082
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,050
Uber Eats.

2083
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,990
The dealer ordered in a lot, so it didn't seem unusual.

2084
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,810
I may have more questions for you later on.

2085
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,870
Yes, sir.

2086
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,750
Yes.

2087
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:06,650
Yes.

2088
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:07,530
Actually, right now.

2089
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:09,210
One more thing.

2090
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,830
I told you everything I know, detective.

2091
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:12,410
Just kidding.

2092
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:13,310
I gotta work.

2093
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:15,250
These monitors don't watch themselves.

2094
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:16,450
Yeah.

2095
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:17,410
It's a tough gig.

2096
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:25,150
I hear like 15 conversations going...

2097
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:25,330
Whoa!

2098
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:28,770
What the hell?

2099
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:29,970
Wait, this...

2100
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:30,930
Oh, this is the room.

2101
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,890
Holy cow.

2102
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,550
This is freaky.

2103
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:36,070
Jesus.

2104
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:37,470
Oh!

2105
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,470
Why'd they strip his body?

2106
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,210
Why'd they make him naked?

2107
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,870
I've seen worse, but not by much.

2108
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,630
Oh, that's a terrible sound.

2109
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,610
Whatever that is.

2110
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:46,550
You could strain him through a sieve.

2111
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,520
Oh, it's a blanket?

2112
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,920
Oh, maybe a rye.

2113
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,480
Oh, I hate that sound.

2114
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,140
Whatever that is.

2115
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:00,380
What are you doing?

2116
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:01,860
The book is here.

2117
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,340
Stop.

2118
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,480
A takeout box from Kingston Kitchens.

2119
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,100
Kingston Kitchens.

2120
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,820
Okay, that sounds like a new place we can go.

2121
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,080
I'd seen more dead animals than live ones in the last 24 hours.

2122
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,200
And now it was dogs.

2123
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,040
Three of them.

2124
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,020
I thought about Maggie and nearly threw up.

2125
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,680
Sorry, the delivery.

2126
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,880
I thought about Maggie and nearly threw up.

2127
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,360
This sucks.

2128
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:34,960
Okay.

2129
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,500
King voice acting right there.

2130
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,180
No, no, no.

2131
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,100
This thing right here.

2132
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,720
I'd seen more dead animals than live ones in the last 24 hours.

2133
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,880
And now it was dogs.

2134
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,700
Three of them.

2135
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,700
I thought about Maggie and nearly threw up.

2136
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,460
Thought about Maggie and nearly threw up.

2137
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,580
Obviously he'd been killed with an explosive.

2138
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,860
And not just because he'd been plastered on the wall with a thousand strokes.

2139
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:03,360
The detonator wire I pulled out of his skull said the whole story.

2140
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:03,500
Oh, nasty.

2141
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,860
But I wondered why the killer didn't just shoot him.

2142
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:06,880
Yeah.

2143
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,480
He wanted to make a... cause a scene.

2144
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,420
Okay, I hate this room.

2145
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,300
It sounds... I don't like the sound in it.

2146
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,960
So I'm trying to get everything that I can.

2147
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,260
Wait, I think that's another dog.

2148
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,240
I've seen more dead animals than... and now it was dogs.

2149
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,220
I thought about Maggie and nearly threw up.

2150
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,380
Okay, I think... okay, there's the three dogs.

2151
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,000
What's... what's this right here?

2152
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,920
The dog collar has a name on it.

2153
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:31,140
Ricky, maybe?

2154
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:31,660
Ricky!

2155
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:34,940
Um...

2156
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,260
I really hate the sound here.

2157
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,480
If you spawn anything you think I oughta know about, tell me.

2158
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:40,580
Absolutely.

2159
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,180
Thanks, Mr. Photographer.

2160
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,780
The sound effect is so funny.

2161
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,900
This looks like it should be something, but it's not.

2162
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,880
If you spawn anything you think I oughta know about...

2163
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:53,480
Okay.

2164
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:54,760
Alright, let's leave.

2165
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,660
Cause it's...

2166
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,140
I hate... high-pitched sound.

2167
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,100
Oh, anything on the walls.

2168
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:01,600
You're right.

2169
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,900
Let's go back in.

2170
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,380
This up here?

2171
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,680
I think that's the security camera he shot.

2172
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,580
Um...

2173
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,480
I don't see anything on the walls.

2174
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,120
Can I walk around the room at all?

2175
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:18,840
No.

2176
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,140
Okay, I think we're...

2177
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:20,800
I think we're done.

2178
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,820
Oh my gosh, horrible.

2179
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,240
I even turned it down for you guys.

2180
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,040
Anything in here?

2181
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,260
Oop, what's that?

2182
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,640
It was a Tyrell sales brochure for the Nexus series.

2183
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,380
The kind of glossy hype that ends up littering the floor at trade shows.

2184
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:40,920
This one was for the new entertainment model.

2185
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,180
A comedian designed to entertain the troops off-world.

2186
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:45,520
Fine.

2187
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,620
What's this?

2188
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,440
The earring was shaped like an insect.

2189
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:54,160
I didn't know much about jewelry, but it looked like junk to me.

2190
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,380
Like the cheap crap sold at the stands and shops of Animoid Row.

2191
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:59,160
Or...

2192
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,740
It's a clue.

2193
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,320
I don't think our...

2194
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,820
I don't think our guy in there wore earrings, huh?

2195
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:07,720
Okay.

2196
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:09,820
We...

2197
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,140
That's a V-tuber.

2198
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,520
Lagging behind again?

2199
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:12,080
Oh!

2200
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,600
Guza didn't say anything about me working with a partner.

2201
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,640
Oh, in a pig's ass, Slim.

2202
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:18,720
No.

2203
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,240
I'm following up on my own.

2204
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:20,980
Oh, damn.

2205
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,900
Could be it's linked to this Tyrell debacle.

2206
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,600
Her case.

2207
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:28,740
How's yours connected to mine?

2208
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,780
I'm still putting the pieces together.

2209
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,420
It's all stored in Esper's mainframe.

2210
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,080
Ah, yours works?

2211
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,820
Did you hear about the Moonbus massacre?

2212
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,420
What?

2213
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,320
Jeff mentioned it.

2214
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,520
Could be our cases are overlapping.

2215
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,440
I might keep you posted.

2216
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,300
Laughs in Japanese.

2217
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:42,980
Do that.

2218
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,160
Do that.

2219
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:45,100
Wait, wait.

2220
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,160
Don't leave yet.

2221
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,460
No!

2222
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,800
Murder like we could shoot her?

2223
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:53,480
That'd be crazy.

2224
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,260
Earring, yeah.

2225
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

2226
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,660
You know if anyone lost an earring like this one lately?

2227
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,280
Yeah, yeah.

2228
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,240
Not one of the employees, that's for sure.

2229
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,320
The boss enforces a strict dress code around here.

2230
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,820
How did Eisenduller's Moomoo fit in?

2231
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,120
Yeah, you know, company rules only apply to the lesser mortal.

2232
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,200
Not the Moomoo!

2233
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,080
You friendly with Eisenduller?

2234
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,700
Most of the employees they see coming in morning and night, but old Marcus...

2235
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,200
I mean, uh, Dr. Eisenduller.

2236
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,100
He almost never left his lab.

2237
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,560
He afraid of somebody?

2238
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,500
I think it had something to do with the air outside.

2239
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,520
And the germs.

2240
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:30,340
The germs!

2241
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,040
I once heard him complain about it.

2242
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,000
Smart.

2243
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,140
What was his job?

2244
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,180
Grub test chief engineer.

2245
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:42,560
The lab runs tests to see how a replicant would perform in different planetary gravitational fields.

2246
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:43,640
That kind of thing.

2247
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,300
One of the other engineers could tell you more.

2248
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:47,420
Whoa!

2249
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,080
Where are the other engineers?

2250
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,700
Well, we got that one tape.

2251
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,020
We can put it in the Esper.

2252
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,220
Oh, wait!

2253
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,460
Now we have Anemoid Row because of the earring!

2254
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:03,900
Nice!

2255
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:07,660
Let's go back to the apartment real quick.

2256
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,440
Because I want to see if the Esper works.

2257
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,020
Oh, wait.

2258
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,340
Do I have to upload it first?

2259
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,720
Maybe I should go to the police officer.

2260
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:16,780
We'll try.

2261
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,140
We'll try.

2262
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:17,480
We'll try.

2263
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,000
The

2264
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,980
thing that allegedly has at least 88 floors.

2265
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,800
There's not a lot of parking spots.

2266
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,200
McCoy, 88F.

2267
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,160
88.

2268
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,420
Thank you.

2269
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:46,210
Good doggy.

2270
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:46,810
Yeah!

2271
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,340
Scanning video desk.

2272
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:55,220
It's working!

2273
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,260
One enhanceable image found.

2274
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,300
Enhance!

2275
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,300
Adding enhanceable photographs to Kaya database.

2276
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,200
Oh, it's Kaya!

2277
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,440
Tyrell Grav Test Lab.

2278
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:08,280
Beep boop beep!

2279
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,180
Brrrp boop!

2280
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,380
Whoa!

2281
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,580
What do I do here?

2282
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:13,180
Ah!

2283
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,180
Brrrp boop!

2284
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,980
Brrrp boop!

2285
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:19,280
Brrrp boop!

2286
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:19,480
Brrrp boop!

2287
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:19,800
Brrrp!

2288
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:20,160
Brrrp!

2289
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:20,280
Brrrp!

2290
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:20,520
Brrrp!

2291
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:20,760
Brrrp boop!

2292
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:22,140
Germs in 2019?

2293
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,980
I hope that's not prophetic.

2294
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:25,960
Uh...

2295
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,120
What am I supposed to do here?

2296
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:29,920
Brrrp boop!

2297
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,340
Brrrp boop!

2298
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,340
Is it gonna tell me anything?

2299
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,400
Can I zoom out?

2300
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,880
Oh, here we go!

2301
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,100
Okay.

2302
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,160
We'll zoom in on our guy here.

2303
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:40,980
Brrrp boop!

2304
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,440
Check out what gun he's using.

2305
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:44,660
Brrrp brrrp brrrp brrrp!

2306
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:45,720
Brrrp brrrp!

2307
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:45,780
Brrrp brrrp!

2308
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,120
Brrrp brrrp brrrp!

2309
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,340
Thank you!

2310
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,320
Thank you, thank you!

2311
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,300
Beep beep!

2312
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,920
Maybe I need to enhance more?

2313
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,100
Brrrp brrrp brrrp brrrp brrrp brrrp brrrp!

2314
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,800
What is this technology?

2315
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:08,600
The earring was shaped like an insect.

2316
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,340
I didn't know much about jewelry, but it looked like junk to me.

2317
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,540
Like the cheap crap sold at the stands and shops of Anemoid Row.

2318
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:15,880
Give me a hard copy of that.

2319
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:22,360
Oh, so if we hadn't gotten the earring there...

2320
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,030
We could have gotten the...

2321
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,180
The prompt to go to Anemoid Row here.

2322
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,600
That's interesting.

2323
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,120
Enhance!

2324
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,300
How did it...

2325
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:34,960
Look at the dog!

2326
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:36,860
Enhance!

2327
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,090
Oh gosh, we're really zooming in on the dog!

2328
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,130
Ricky!

2329
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:49,370
The dog collar has a name on it.

2330
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:50,570
Ricky, maybe?

2331
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:51,990
Give me a hard copy of that.

2332
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,810
Oh, and if you missed the collar too!

2333
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,950
It's kind of interesting.

2334
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:03,230
So it's like everything that we saw at the scene.

2335
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,090
But just in case you missed it.

2336
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,310
Was there anything hit with him?

2337
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:09,690
No?

2338
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:16,650
Oh, Ricky, you're so fine, you're so fine.

2339
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,310
You're on my mind, Ricky!

2340
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:20,470
Ricky!

2341
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:22,710
Enhance!

2342
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:23,990
Enhance!

2343
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:27,250
Keep enhancing!

2344
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:32,910
Enhance!

2345
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:34,950
Okay, never mind.

2346
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:36,790
I think we've run out of everything.

2347
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,710
Zoom in on the junk.

2348
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:42,690
It wasn't...

2349
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:44,730
There was like a pizza box or something we found too.

2350
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,290
Oh yeah, see, see, maybe this.

2351
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:50,850
They were like, oh, that...

2352
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:51,830
Nope, that's not it.

2353
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:53,890
Wow, though!

2354
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,470
Look at the graphics!

2355
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:57,990
This game is really good looking, huh?

2356
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:04,410
Okay.

2357
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:06,110
I think we got it.

2358
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:08,730
Don't feel paranoid about missing clues.

2359
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:11,530
This game has redundant evidences to mitigate that issue.

2360
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,450
Just like the collar thing you caught earlier.

2361
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:14,570
Neat!

2362
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:17,250
Okay, bye, Maggie!

2363
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:19,410
Hold on.

2364
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:20,950
Come here.

2365
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,750
Here you go, baby.

2366
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,570
Dinner time.

2367
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:25,670
Oh yeah, baby!

2368
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:27,610
What is this?

2369
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:29,910
Huh.

2370
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:34,070
Your floor number, please.

2371
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,530
It is very smart.

2372
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:40,030
Oh no, I didn't have her say it!

2373
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:41,130
Oof.

2374
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:42,450
Oof.

2375
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:43,830
Oof.

2376
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,190
Oof.

2377
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:02,410
To Anemoid Row.

2378
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,820
Wait, this looks exactly like that earring.

2379
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,660
Excuse me, pal.

2380
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,640
Excuse me, pal.

2381
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,060
I have questions to ask you.

2382
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,760
Or I'm gonna ask this guy here.

2383
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,600
You know who deals in insects down here?

2384
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,260
You don't want insects?

2385
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,160
They're no good companions.

2386
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:32,460
But fish.

2387
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:33,820
Fish are good.

2388
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,540
I don't think fish...

2389
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,220
I have every kind of fish for you.

2390
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,660
I don't think they're any better of a companion.

2391
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,320
Whole fish, dorado, miniature sailfish.

2392
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:41,300
Very friendly.

2393
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,540
Miniature sailfish?

2394
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:42,860
No, thanks.

2395
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,040
I got a dog at home.

2396
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,080
Fish just as good as dog.

2397
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,320
No, my dog is real.

2398
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,300
Real?

2399
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:52,020
Oh, you must make lots of money.

2400
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,780
Let's get back to insects.

2401
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,280
Official LPD business.

2402
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:56,260
Ah.

2403
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,700
Down at end of Animal Row.

2404
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,460
You see big green sign?

2405
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,040
My dog is real.

2406
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:01,840
You try there.

2407
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:02,760
Is he really?

2408
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,720
Good luck with all, friend.

2409
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,460
Hope he stays healthy.

2410
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:06,420
She.

2411
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,160
Is she really real?

2412
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:13,760
Or is he deluding himself, you know?

2413
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,400
What's in here?

2414
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:20,840
Whoa.

2415
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:22,780
Oh.

2416
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:23,740
Excuse me, pal.

2417
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:24,800
Nobody...

2418
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:25,620
Are we invisible?

2419
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,440
Like...

2420
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,420
Why doesn't anybody acknowledge us?

2421
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:31,780
I hear monkey.

2422
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,460
Give me the monkey.

2423
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:43,050
I don't remember this part at all.

2424
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,410
I'll be honest.

2425
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,070
I got a couple of questions for you, Captain.

2426
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,590
Captain.

2427
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,950
First one's on the house.

2428
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,070
The rest you pay for.

2429
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:51,150
You want chit-chat, you hire a hooker.

2430
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:52,810
This ain't no social club.

2431
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:59,050
I thought the music was going wah-wah.

2432
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:03,050
Pour me one.

2433
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:04,470
Just one?

2434
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:06,490
One, but one good one.

2435
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:07,810
One good one?

2436
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,030
Okay, we have to ask you a question.

2437
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:12,310
Or, we...

2438
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,910
Pour me one.

2439
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:13,990
Oh, another one?

2440
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,330
One?

2441
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:14,710
Okay.

2442
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,350
One, but one good one.

2443
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,450
Another good one.

2444
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,530
Two of them.

2445
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:19,750
Uh...

2446
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,930
I thought we were asking questions.

2447
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,670
What?

2448
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:23,610
Pour me one.

2449
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:23,990
Wait.

2450
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:25,010
Just one?

2451
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:26,070
Sir, we're on the job!

2452
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,050
One, but one good one.

2453
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:27,830
Stop it!

2454
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:30,050
One, but one good one?

2455
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:31,290
What's a good one?

2456
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:33,650
Can't we have another one?

2457
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,570
I guess we're not asking questions.

2458
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:37,410
We're getting drunk.

2459
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:43,090
The beer o'clock!

2460
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:45,550
Oh, yeah, we got the day off, huh?

2461
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,510
What is this?

2462
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:49,170
That looks like chicken.

2463
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:50,990
Step up!

2464
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:51,850
Step up!

2465
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:54,290
Mama, Isabella put you something special.

2466
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:55,090
How drunk can I get?

2467
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,170
Put a glow in your cheek.

2468
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:57,930
McCoy, LPD.

2469
01:39:58,210 --> 01:39:59,650
Mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

2470
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,030
Questions?

2471
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,970
They always need answers.

2472
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,850
Um, this photo.

2473
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:08,730
This guy worked for you?

2474
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:09,590
Oh.

2475
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:11,570
No, but I wish you do.

2476
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,750
He be one fine looking man.

2477
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:14,990
You sure?

2478
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:16,290
Never seen him before?

2479
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,490
I'd remembered him for sure.

2480
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:21,430
What else?

2481
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:22,430
Marcus...

2482
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:22,530
Oh.

2483
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:26,290
You send a lot of deliveries over to Marcus Eisenduller at the Tyrell building?

2484
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:26,950
Yeah, didn't it?

2485
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,210
Eisenduller.

2486
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:29,050
Oh, Eisenduller.

2487
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,650
Yeah, this is the place that it had the...

2488
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:30,710
Yeah.

2489
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:32,070
Let me tell you.

2490
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:32,950
That man could do it.

2491
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:33,690
I can't eat.

2492
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:34,850
I had the take out once.

2493
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:35,830
Send anything over lately?

2494
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:37,290
No sir.

2495
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:39,530
No deliveries to him no more.

2496
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:41,170
Not since last month.

2497
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:43,270
He be way behind on his bill.

2498
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:43,810
Not for a month.

2499
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:46,750
He works for a big company and he's not paying his bill.

2500
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,770
That means no more till him pay up.

2501
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:49,790
You may have a little trouble collecting.

2502
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:50,730
He's dead.

2503
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,670
Oh, I guess she doesn't care about that.

2504
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:56,470
That stew's looking tasty.

2505
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,430
Yeah, let's get some stew.

2506
01:40:57,470 --> 01:40:58,510
Picture right up.

2507
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,030
Only dirty chinion.

2508
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:01,930
It put a spring in your step month.

2509
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,930
The ladies, they be loving you.

2510
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:04,970
The ladies.

2511
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:07,330
Did we get one?

2512
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,230
Did we get the stew?

2513
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,150
What's over here?

2514
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:13,410
Oh, where are we?

2515
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:15,410
We went to Hawkers.

2516
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:20,470
This is Bullet Bob's runner surplus.

2517
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:22,470
Wait, we're like just...

2518
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:25,690
We're just like chilling outside now.

2519
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:26,070
Wait.

2520
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,130
I kinda wanna explore a little.

2521
01:41:29,870 --> 01:41:30,590
It's true.

2522
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:32,030
Ladies do love stew.

2523
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:34,730
Is that a .45 blaster under your coat?

2524
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:36,050
Or you're just happy to be here?

2525
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:39,150
You got good eyes.

2526
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:39,610
The turret!

2527
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:40,450
They ought to be.

2528
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:44,030
They're the only organs of mine that survived the Phobos Wars intact.

2529
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:46,490
Ray McCoy, Rep Detect.

2530
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,110
Blade Runner, huh?

2531
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:50,210
Oh, he said the thing!

2532
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:51,190
He said the thing!

2533
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:52,470
Blade Runner.

2534
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:56,970
Yeah.

2535
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,450
That doesn't look very safe.

2536
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,790
How come I never heard of you?

2537
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:04,250
I just got assigned.

2538
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,410
Yeah, I'm kinda buddies with Davey Holden.

2539
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:08,650
How's he doing?

2540
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:10,690
Word is he's gonna be okay.

2541
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:14,990
That skin job must have been pretty damn quick getting by Davey like that.

2542
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,350
He's the best in the business.

2543
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:19,270
He'll be back in the job soon.

2544
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,190
Now I'm the best in the business.

2545
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:21,550
Did you see my high score?

2546
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,550
Can we buy a gun?

2547
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:29,410
I wanna buy a big ol' big something.

2548
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,410
That guy came ambushed.

2549
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,390
It came up on me.

2550
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,630
I'm scared.

2551
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,310
There was this area too.

2552
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:36,730
Let's see.

2553
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:38,370
Happy 15 months, Vicky.

2554
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:39,150
Thank you!

2555
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:40,830
Thank you so much for 15!

2556
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:43,570
We're back here!

2557
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:45,250
Wait, can we go in now?

2558
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,130
Locked.

2559
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:47,710
Locked.

2560
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:48,850
Dang it, why?

2561
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,460
Okay, let's go back in.

2562
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,360
And then we go this way.

2563
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:06,470
And we keep walking.

2564
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:07,670
We keep going.

2565
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:09,230
Can we go in here?

2566
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:11,250
No.

2567
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,170
This guy just pours this one.

2568
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:15,410
And we don't pay for it.

2569
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:17,830
And we also are getting drunk.

2570
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:17,850
Okay.

2571
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,710
Where's the monkey coming from?

2572
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,250
One other thing.

2573
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:27,730
If you need to be extra persuasive, have your gun out.

2574
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:28,350
Wait, seriously?

2575
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:31,610
Interesting.

2576
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,090
You don't say.

2577
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:34,710
Hey, you.

2578
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:35,690
Hey, you.

2579
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:38,530
I'm trying to talk to this guy all the way over there.

2580
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:41,830
It works?

2581
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:42,650
No kidding.

2582
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,040
Hey, you.

2583
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,020
Hey, you.

2584
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,140
Might I interest you in a snake, noble one?

2585
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,100
A snake?

2586
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:55,960
Not today, thanks.

2587
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,320
Oh.

2588
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:57,800
No, no.

2589
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:58,300
Come on.

2590
01:43:58,460 --> 01:43:59,320
I'm the noble...

2591
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:03,230
The earring.

2592
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:04,050
This your work?

2593
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,150
Ah.

2594
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,170
Dragon.

2595
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:07,370
Dragon?

2596
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,370
Si.

2597
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:10,090
An asoptera.

2598
01:44:11,110 --> 01:44:11,510
Dragonfly.

2599
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:14,230
Late of the American South Swamp Plant.

2600
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,590
You sell jewelry with dragonflies?

2601
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:18,190
Item like that.

2602
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:19,970
Very special significance.

2603
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,410
Very rare, senor.

2604
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:24,130
Estate item.

2605
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:27,270
And most likely part of large collection.

2606
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:32,150
A person must have plenty of money to obtain a collection.

2607
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:33,790
More than I can afford.

2608
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:35,950
You try Hawker's Circle.

2609
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,810
Might want to try for this.

2610
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:40,310
With luck, you may find.

2611
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:43,630
If this is from a collection, I'm also looking for the other pieces.

2612
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,310
I make you a deal.

2613
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:48,910
I found out where to get dragonfly jewelry.

2614
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:49,450
Uh-huh.

2615
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:51,970
Then, you buy a piece, right?

2616
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,290
For special lady friends.

2617
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:56,190
You come back later.

2618
01:44:56,730 --> 01:44:57,370
I'll do that.

2619
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:58,650
Our special lady robot.

2620
01:44:58,750 --> 01:44:59,610
You take care.

2621
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,270
Chasing the dragon.

2622
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:04,130
Um.

2623
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:07,850
Handsome man like you as lady friend.

2624
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:08,610
Of course.

2625
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,690
All my girl cares about is food and lava.

2626
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:12,690
Uh, how romantic.

2627
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:13,590
Maggie!

2628
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:13,870
Don't say Maggie.

2629
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:15,290
What is this girl's name?

2630
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:16,450
Maggie.

2631
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,650
Maggie, Maggie.

2632
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:19,670
Ah!

2633
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:21,230
Maggie, senor.

2634
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:22,710
It's perfect.

2635
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:23,730
Is it not?

2636
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:24,310
Wait.

2637
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:27,490
Wait.

2638
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:32,150
So...

2639
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:50,060
They didn't want to make Ryan Gosling in love with his dog?

2640
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:08,420
Kinda starting to worry about McCoy's feelings.

2641
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,440
I guess we'll buy it.

2642
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:11,140
It's kinda ugly.

2643
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,440
How about you talking?

2644
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,020
Damn!

2645
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,420
We have no to act, do we?

2646
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,560
You hear anything yet about that dragonfly jewelry?

2647
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,520
Like what I showed you before?

2648
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,440
Yeah, we bought the thing.

2649
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,240
No, senor.

2650
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,720
My friend, he's asking for me.

2651
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,360
If you come back later, maybe I know something more.

2652
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,880
I don't think it's that kind of love, are you sure?

2653
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:31,220
Careful, senor.

2654
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,540
Your poison.

2655
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,600
Ooh, what are they?

2656
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,000
Scorpions.

2657
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:34,760
Scorpions!

2658
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,000
See?

2659
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:36,960
Finest quality.

2660
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,300
Perhaps you purchased one?

2661
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,140
Can I?

2662
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:40,800
I don't think so.

2663
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,840
They're beautiful though.

2664
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:42,720
No, I want one, please!

2665
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,300
I've never seen one before.

2666
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:43,940
Please!

2667
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,040
Oh, that'd be true, senor.

2668
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,180
Ah, they're so cute.

2669
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,880
Okay, so now we have...

2670
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,380
We gotta go back home so we can give our dog this beautiful piece of jewelry.

2671
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,700
For Maggie.

2672
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,040
So let's go home.

2673
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,580
Polo waifu or dog dad?

2674
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:10,760
What kind of Blade Runner are you?

2675
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:12,460
Yeah.

2676
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:20,800
He claims that Maggie's real, but for some reason I'm kind of doubting it.

2677
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,480
What about hawkers?

2678
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:26,400
That's where we were!

2679
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:26,720
No?

2680
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:30,500
Hold on, we'll go back.

2681
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,860
After we give Mackie her present.

2682
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,120
What if we die on the job?

2683
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:42,020
I still can't believe we were just running back home and that guys just came out from nowhere.

2684
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,060
I can't believe that happened to us.

2685
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,580
I'm not over it.

2686
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,440
I have trust issues with this rooftop now.

2687
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,880
I mean...

2688
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,440
Apartment.

2689
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,000
Roof.

2690
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,680
Roof.

2691
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,380
McCoy.

2692
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,240
88F.

2693
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,220
88.

2694
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:57,440
Thank you.

2695
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,200
That's what life was like in 2019.

2696
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:00,660
Yeah.

2697
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,740
So much has changed in the past six years.

2698
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:05,280
Maggie!

2699
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:05,940
Maggie?

2700
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:06,660
Come here, girl.

2701
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,180
I got something for you.

2702
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,580
Good doggy.

2703
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:10,920
Can you put it on?

2704
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:12,720
No?

2705
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,580
Who's the best dog in the whole world?

2706
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,220
He's so cute.

2707
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,660
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

2708
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,840
Wait, we can't give it to her.

2709
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:23,720
Here you go, baby.

2710
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:24,560
Dinner time.

2711
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:25,880
Aw, come on.

2712
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:27,660
What do you mean Maggie isn't real?

2713
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,680
She's real to me!

2714
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:33,620
I learned that Uma Musume got Ace Combat Composer in the game.

2715
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:37,520
Ace Combat and also Metal Gear.

2716
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,660
Hello, Nan.

2717
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,220
Who's the best dog in the whole world?

2718
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:46,100
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

2719
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,380
Okay.

2720
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:50,060
Oh, gosh.

2721
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:50,700
That scared me.

2722
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,960
We have so many clues.

2723
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,720
Look at this.

2724
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,340
This is insane.

2725
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,260
The dog collar has a name on it.

2726
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,480
Ricky, maybe?

2727
01:48:58,740 --> 01:48:59,240
Ricky.

2728
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,380
Maggie.

2729
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:01,980
Oh, wait, here.

2730
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,500
This is the bracelet.

2731
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,820
It says Maggie on it.

2732
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:07,840
Interesting.

2733
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,860
I'd rather not.

2734
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:09,800
Thank you so much for the thing.

2735
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,760
Thank you.

2736
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:14,140
The earring was shaped like an insect.

2737
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,840
I didn't know much about jewelry, but it looked like junk to me.

2738
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,060
Like the cheap crap sold at the stands and shops of Anemoid Row.

2739
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:21,460
Oh, whoa.

2740
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,520
Maggie, you good?

2741
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,420
Maggie is definitely a robot.

2742
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,100
Your floor number, please.

2743
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,400
Back

2744
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:42,580
to hawkers.

2745
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,220
Massive hawkers.

2746
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,340
A real set of godawkers.

2747
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:06,670
What did she say to ask in there about?

2748
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:09,770
I can't remember.

2749
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:11,670
It's fine, we'll figure it out.

2750
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:16,430
It was like, this is Hawkers, no?

2751
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:19,950
Because we came... Is

2752
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,360
he gonna pour us another one?

2753
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,040
Oh, wait!

2754
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:28,500
Wow.

2755
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,440
She's a dog.

2756
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:33,000
So is my wife, but I sure as hell don't brag about it.

2757
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:34,480
Pour me one.

2758
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,800
Just one?

2759
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,800
One, but one good one.

2760
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:39,140
Yeah, see, it's Hawkers Barkeep.

2761
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,600
Pour me one.

2762
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:46,000
Just one?

2763
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,060
One, but one good one.

2764
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,700
One, but one good one.

2765
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,620
Why did you say it like that?

2766
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:54,380
Anything over here?

2767
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:58,000
Can't talk to these people, we can't disturb them.

2768
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:01,120
I need to ask you...

2769
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:04,540
Whoa!

2770
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,440
That guy looks suspicious.

2771
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,440
Are you taking any drugs?

2772
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,400
Oh, my God!

2773
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:28,670
Nancy Drew, bro.

2774
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:30,170
Truly.

2775
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:31,810
Such a social butterfly.

2776
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:33,950
Oh, my goodness.

2777
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:34,910
Thanks for your time.

2778
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:38,310
I'm a little lost.

2779
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:41,830
Maybe I go talk to that guy with my gun out.

2780
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:45,070
But I'm scared he's gonna get... I'm gonna get shot at or something.

2781
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:47,630
Hey, mister!

2782
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:51,130
I have a question to ask you.

2783
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:52,230
Oh.

2784
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:54,310
Wait, maybe I can't ask him.

2785
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:55,950
Cause I have my gun out.

2786
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,390
Pull me one.

2787
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,230
Just one?

2788
01:51:58,030 --> 01:51:59,290
One, but one good one.

2789
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,490
I missed a screen!

2790
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:01,170
Wait, where?

2791
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:05,450
Are you talking about this one?

2792
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:06,690
There was nothing here, though.

2793
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:07,650
Where was there?

2794
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:11,170
Are you taking any drugs?

2795
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:11,750
McCoy, LPD.

2796
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:14,570
Oh, maybe this person.

2797
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:16,150
Oh, she's just standing there.

2798
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:17,890
Two minutes.

2799
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:22,150
That's how much time I give every stranger that wanders in here off the street.

2800
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,790
Okay, good.

2801
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:24,290
Sell a lot of stuff that way?

2802
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:26,230
I don't encourage browsers.

2803
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:30,990
What impresses me are people who know what they want and are not afraid to pay for it.

2804
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:33,550
What's the most expensive thing you got in here?

2805
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:33,990
Yeah.

2806
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:36,330
Value is a relative notion.

2807
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:39,730
What's significant to you might be meaningless to me.

2808
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:41,590
And vice versa.

2809
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:43,770
Everything here is guaranteed.

2810
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:46,750
The finest, most authentic anyone here.

2811
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:47,510
Are these drugs?

2812
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:48,190
What are we getting?

2813
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:50,610
I'm scared.

2814
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,750
What do you got for me?

2815
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:55,710
Can I go in?

2816
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:56,630
Oh.

2817
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:57,890
What?

2818
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,810
That wasn't two minutes.

2819
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,530
Wait, how do I...eh?

2820
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,590
Excuse me.

2821
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,370
Are you on drugs?

2822
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:11,530
I'm

2823
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:16,930
confused.

2824
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,390
Will he come back out?

2825
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:22,750
Excuse me, pal.

2826
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:30,110
Want drugs, please?

2827
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:30,950
Yeah.

2828
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:34,150
Excuse me, I would like to buy a drug.

2829
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,450
Can you go in?

2830
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,330
I can't do anything.

2831
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,870
Oh, he's back!

2832
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:43,970
Let me tell you what I want, and maybe I'll impress you.

2833
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:46,030
Or my paperwork is in order.

2834
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:47,190
Doesn't matter.

2835
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:48,410
I don't read, anyhow.

2836
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:49,590
What's your name?

2837
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,250
Iza.

2838
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,610
You move a lot of valuable goods through here.

2839
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:52,910
I can't read.

2840
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:53,970
Valuable and exotic.

2841
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:55,230
How exotic?

2842
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:59,050
We're talking exceptionally fine jewelry in the shape of a dragonfly.

2843
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:00,930
Oh.

2844
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:01,810
They were so majestic.

2845
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,010
Oh, he knows.

2846
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,910
I remember them from my childhood.

2847
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,130
Oh, dragonflies.

2848
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:06,390
That was the last time I've seen them.

2849
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:09,270
It's very important that I find out about this.

2850
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:09,970
Can you help me?

2851
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:16,210
If I see something, and you can match whatever my collectors will pay, it's all yours.

2852
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:17,850
Thanks a million.

2853
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:19,610
Thank you.

2854
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:19,890
There you go.

2855
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:22,490
I'm looking for some jewelry in the shape of an insect.

2856
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:24,910
Your two minutes are out.

2857
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:25,990
Damn.

2858
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:27,030
No, they're not.

2859
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:28,750
I'm looking for some jewelry in the shape of an insect.

2860
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,730
Part of the two minutes was you walking away.

2861
01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:31,930
For a whole minute.

2862
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,430
No.

2863
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:36,030
We got scammed.

2864
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:39,870
You walked away for a whole minute, though.

2865
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:42,110
Okay.

2866
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:48,890
So now we are waiting on two people to figure out something about the dragonfly.

2867
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:53,270
Time to pull out the gun.

2868
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:56,090
Wait, will it let me?

2869
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:56,630
Let's try.

2870
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:00,990
I wonder how easy it is to game over in this game.

2871
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:05,010
Excuse me, I have some questions to ask you.

2872
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:10,490
It won't let me talk to people with my gun out.

2873
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:12,630
Are we sure that's how we're more persuasive?

2874
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:15,650
I think you have to sleep.

2875
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:16,370
I think so too.

2876
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,230
I think that's how you like progress.

2877
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:25,970
You get through a day and then you sleep and then you have something else happen.

2878
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:29,930
How do you save in this?

2879
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:32,650
That's a great question.

2880
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,280
Thought you had the day off.

2881
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,440
No, he was just saying that.

2882
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,280
He was just saying that to be nice.

2883
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,200
But the bullets ask the questions.

2884
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:01,640
Yeah, but we won't get answers unless... unless... we miss.

2885
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:03,520
Your floor number, please.

2886
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,320
McCoy, 88F.

2887
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,260
88.

2888
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:10,520
Thank you.

2889
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:17,730
Maggie!

2890
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:19,110
Maggie!

2891
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,850
Come here, girl.

2892
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,170
Hello, Maggie.

2893
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:23,050
Stop barking at me.

2894
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:24,710
Hold on, I'm gonna click escape.

2895
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:26,130
Okay, save game.

2896
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:29,310
Nice.

2897
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:31,050
Okay, cool.

2898
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:32,910
Let's go to sleep.

2899
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:34,910
I wish that were me.

2900
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:35,770
I wish I were sleeping.

2901
01:56:37,070 --> 01:56:38,450
Wishing I was fishing.

2902
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,970
In my dreams.

2903
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:42,590
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

2904
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:57,640
I love how we can just majestically stare out our window.

2905
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:03,580
This feels like a... like a live wallpaper you could have or something, you know?

2906
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:08,720
Just like the ambiance of... of LA in 2019.

2907
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:15,590
With the music and everything.

2908
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:28,790
This is such a vibe!

2909
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:32,630
Do a flip!

2910
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,550
Then...

2911
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:45,870
What do we do now?

2912
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:51,010
Maybe since we slept, they'll have the information.

2913
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:58,370
Your floor number, please.

2914
01:57:58,850 --> 01:57:59,330
Oof.

2915
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:01,270
Oof.

2916
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,960
I'm suspicious every time I come up here.

2917
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:18,380
The music is great because Frank Papaki is a god.

2918
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:22,220
They didn't have the rights to the music so they had to replicate the movie soundtrack by ear.

2919
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:22,920
That's insane!

2920
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:23,420
What?

2921
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,900
My nose is so itchy today.

2922
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:36,130
Back to Anemoid Row.

2923
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:48,370
Let's see if the information has come through yet.

2924
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:49,830
Please.

2925
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,070
Please!

2926
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:54,750
The dragonfly!

2927
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:04,180
You hear anything yet about that dragonfly jewelry?

2928
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:05,340
Like what I showed you before?

2929
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,820
No, senor.

2930
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:09,360
My friend, he's asking for me.

2931
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:12,980
If you come back later, maybe I know something more.

2932
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:18,560
Okay, well if she doesn't know, I think probably the other guy won't know.

2933
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:21,200
What do I do from here?

2934
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:24,160
Maybe we go to the...

2935
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:26,380
...animal store.

2936
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:27,100
I don't know.

2937
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,080
Try the other guy.

2938
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:33,820
We can try.

2939
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,300
If he comes back out.

2940
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:36,940
It's perfect timing.

2941
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:37,860
Speak of the devil.

2942
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,260
I'm looking for some jewelry in the shape of an insect.

2943
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,680
Your two minutes are up.

2944
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:43,420
No!

2945
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,240
Please!

2946
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,600
I'm gonna shoot you!

2947
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,660
I'm gonna shoot!

2948
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,880
This is your warning shot!

2949
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,580
I swear I'll do it!

2950
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,520
Go to Chinatown?

2951
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:02,740
Go to Chinatown?

2952
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:04,140
To Chinatown.

2953
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:11,650
Ask him nicely for two more minutes.

2954
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:12,910
Please, sir.

2955
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,590
May I have some more?

2956
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,790
Please, please, sir.

2957
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:24,730
I was thinking the pet store, but I think it'll still be locked.

2958
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,190
Where's the chef?

2959
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:38,530
Wait, where's the guy who does...

2960
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,170
Where's Howie?

2961
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:40,970
Howie?

2962
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,550
Howie?

2963
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:45,930
Howie?

2964
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:51,530
Is he running...

2965
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:52,290
Is he back here?

2966
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:53,390
Taking a smoke break?

2967
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:55,490
No?

2968
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:59,850
Your two minutes may be up, but the rest of his life is up.

2969
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:00,210
Yeah!

2970
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:05,970
Is he with the American Idol?

2971
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:10,030
Oh, look at this!

2972
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:11,530
This is open now.

2973
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:13,790
Not Howie Mandel.

2974
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:16,630
That guy posted his prolapsed anus online.

2975
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,910
Whoa, what's here?

2976
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:21,070
Oh.

2977
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:23,310
Nothing?

2978
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:24,990
It's just a shortcut around?

2979
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:27,850
Oh!

2980
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:28,650
Whoa!

2981
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:31,090
Whoa, we went in a full circle!

2982
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:31,110
Whoa!

2983
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:35,710
Yeah, he did that.

2984
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:40,610
That's like the only thing I know about him.

2985
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:47,360
Yeah, he posted his prolapsed anus on...

2986
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,500
I think it was...

2987
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:52,340
It might have been TikTok, and people were like, Howie, what is this?

2988
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:56,100
I think we got over that way too quickly, I'm not gonna lie.

2989
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:57,160
Locked.

2990
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,120
Locked.

2991
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:03,020
First time you were here.

2992
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:03,500
Oh!

2993
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:04,300
Hello!

2994
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:08,440
I have a lot of knowledge about different things.

2995
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:12,860
You'll always learn something new on the...

2996
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:14,360
Mint Phantom channel!

2997
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,000
Howie, what is this?

2998
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,940
No, it's not Freak Phantom...

2999
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:27,100
How is it I'm the freak and I didn't post my...

3000
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:29,120
My booty hole!

3001
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,280
We'll just take your word for that.

3002
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,000
It's true!

3003
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,140
It's a true story!

3004
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,400
Guys, I might need to consult the game facts.

3005
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:50,800
I'm lost.

3006
02:03:02,070 --> 02:03:04,750
I'm gonna check this place one last time.

3007
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:07,250
Maybe we'll go back to Tyrell.

3008
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,820
Peak Freak.

3009
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:15,340
Locked.

3010
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,240
Locked.

3011
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:16,740
Okay.

3012
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:22,640
I write off my super chat too as educational expenses on my dad.

3013
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,980
I think that knowing this, like...

3014
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:30,220
This makes you a freak.

3015
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:31,240
No!

3016
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,900
Okay, hold on.

3017
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:38,880
Game facts time.

3018
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,210
Lead...

3019
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:44,930
Lead...

3020
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:45,530
Runner...

3021
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:47,110
Game...

3022
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:48,230
Walkthrough.

3023
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,740
Messy up there, isn't it?

3024
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:56,680
Yeah.

3025
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,960
Do you know anything else, mister?

3026
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:01,380
How do I get in to see the big boss?

3027
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:03,860
You don't, unless he wants to see you.

3028
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,480
Okay, how do I make him want to see me?

3029
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,320
Well, you could call his personal assistant...

3030
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:09,720
I ask that every day.

3031
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:10,480
Who is...

3032
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,340
Don't know, offhand.

3033
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:14,120
Yeah, I get the picture.

3034
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:18,820
I ask that every day of my afterlife.

3035
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:21,900
I may have more questions for you later on.

3036
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,940
Yes, sir.

3037
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:29,030
I want to see big boss.

3038
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:31,290
Anything else in here?

3039
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:35,450
Oh, the photographer's gone.

3040
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:37,690
And the dogs!

3041
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:39,190
But they didn't take the guy.

3042
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:40,330
Disgusting.

3043
02:04:40,630 --> 02:04:41,170
Jeez.

3044
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,970
Everybody is yucky to you, huh?

3045
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:49,990
One day you'll be like that.

3046
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:53,630
Free corpse.

3047
02:04:53,630 --> 02:04:53,750
Oops.

3048
02:04:54,670 --> 02:04:55,550
Okay, hold on.

3049
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,410
The hide and walk through.

3050
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:04,270
Let's see.

3051
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:25,290
Where am I?

3052
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:28,890
I don't think I'm at there.

3053
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:31,050
Oh, I'm only at Act 2.

3054
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:31,710
Okay, hold on.

3055
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:33,870
Uh...

3056
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:34,810
Apartment.

3057
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:35,310
Okay.

3058
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:36,530
What am I missing?

3059
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:45,580
It says that Two Minutes Guy is meant to have more dialogue, but doesn't say how.

3060
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:49,800
Hmm...

3061
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:53,600
In Blade Runner's LA is based on historical LA's oil fields.

3062
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,240
Those oil fields are still technically in LA.

3063
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,620
But hidden under...

3064
02:05:57,620 --> 02:06:00,800
Facades to blend them in with the surrounding city.

3065
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:01,780
Ooh.

3066
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:03,520
Kinda like how they'll make...

3067
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,020
They'll make...

3068
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,320
Electrical poles look like trees.

3069
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:17,480
Animoid Row.

3070
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:23,640
Izzo.

3071
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:25,440
Uh...

3072
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,800
Talk to him and he'll pull the camera off the shelf.

3073
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:28,140
What?

3074
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:29,240
How?

3075
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:31,080
How?

3076
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:34,540
Uh...

3077
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:35,020
Ah?

3078
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:37,140
Oh?

3079
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,340
He didn't do that.

3080
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:39,580
What?

3081
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,180
He told me that my two minutes were up.

3082
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,220
He doesn't like me.

3083
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,760
It's because of my bad personality.

3084
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,220
I'm too erotic.

3085
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,620
Is this the one from 97?

3086
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:56,860
Yes.

3087
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:09,460
Oh, I think we gotta go to the police station.

3088
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:10,460
Maybe.

3089
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,920
Your two users choice.

3090
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:20,600
Which one was the guzzler?

3091
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:21,440
Here?

3092
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,300
I think he was on the...

3093
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:23,640
Ground floor.

3094
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,300
Ground floor.

3095
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:31,480
We make cell phone towers look like palm trees in California.

3096
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:34,520
In Florida, they're just there.

3097
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:35,420
Yeah.

3098
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:37,380
All that 5G.

3099
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:38,480
Oh, here.

3100
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:39,040
Right?

3101
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:39,180
Got it.

3102
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,700
Isn't his name guzzler?

3103
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:43,780
Guzzman?

3104
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,700
Tell him that was your twin brother.

3105
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,660
So you get two more minutes.

3106
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:53,160
Oh!

3107
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:55,380
Hello?

3108
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:57,400
Guzzy?

3109
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:58,140
Wait.

3110
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:01,120
What's that?

3111
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:06,100
I don't see anything else in here.

3112
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:07,320
Huh?

3113
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:15,180
Oh, his name is Guzza.

3114
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,080
What did I do wrong?

3115
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,240
Thank you, thank you.

3116
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:33,920
They called me the guzzler in college.

3117
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:36,660
They call me that at the club.

3118
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:48,890
Sorry, I'm reading the walkthrough.

3119
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,040
I can't tell.

3120
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,000
Bring the weapons order to the shooting range.

3121
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,520
Ah!

3122
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:36,800
Oh my gosh.

3123
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,060
I think you need to head back to Tyrell.

3124
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:48,900
I already did that.

3125
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:48,940
What?

3126
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:57,060
Mainframe and shooting range.

3127
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:04,190
Maybe I'd talk to these guys.

3128
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:06,490
That weapon shipment just came in.

3129
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:07,790
You got the paperwork handy?

3130
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:08,730
Why?

3131
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:11,250
You got a pressing need to rummage through my private files?

3132
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:12,210
Yeah.

3133
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:14,850
I forgot you were keeping your lacy underthings in there.

3134
02:10:15,030 --> 02:10:15,970
Ooh la la.

3135
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:16,250
Look, Jack.

3136
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:18,970
I just want to see what they're charging for a crate of rifles these days.

3137
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:21,090
Too damn much if you ask me.

3138
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:23,710
Especially at the rate the assault teams are losing them.

3139
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:25,790
I guess there ain't no harm in it.

3140
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:27,730
What?

3141
02:10:28,650 --> 02:10:30,470
Can we get a new weapons shipment?

3142
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:34,270
Yeah, Guza requisitioned a couple of cases for the assault teams.

3143
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:35,430
Let me guess.

3144
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:37,730
He's planning on taking out a small city.

3145
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,970
Lieutenant's a big believer in overkill.

3146
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,370
Okay.

3147
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:52,370
Anything in the Asper room?

3148
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:55,570
Uploading personal clue database.

3149
02:10:58,830 --> 02:11:01,190
Downloading mainframe clue database.

3150
02:11:01,950 --> 02:11:02,750
Confused.

3151
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:06,530
Clue database transfer complete.

3152
02:11:11,170 --> 02:11:13,330
We still have just that one picture?

3153
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:14,270
Yup.

3154
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,830
We didn't get anything else.

3155
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:20,670
I'm confused.

3156
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:24,970
Let's try the autopsy guy.

3157
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:26,650
See if he's got anything new for us.

3158
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:34,750
Oh, no, he's not even here.

3159
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:39,870
Ah, stop.

3160
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:40,970
Geez.

3161
02:11:58,760 --> 02:11:59,800
Where is it?

3162
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,880
The thing that...

3163
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:03,060
The shipping form?

3164
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:03,820
Is that what it was?

3165
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:08,900
What's the point of having this as a clue if I can't even...

3166
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:09,800
Look at it.

3167
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,500
Save me, digital woman.

3168
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,060
What's the point?

3169
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:30,280
What's the point?

3170
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:32,580
I can't even like, uh...

3171
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:33,240
Observe it.

3172
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,400
Like...

3173
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,680
I guess I'll try going back to the animoid... role.

3174
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:56,660
I don't know.

3175
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:07,340
Try now.

3176
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:14,080
Excuse me.

3177
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:15,940
Ever consort with a group called CARS?

3178
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:16,920
C-A-R-S?

3179
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:18,260
CARS.

3180
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:19,240
What is that?

3181
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,080
Citizens against replicant slavery.

3182
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:24,400
I don't have time for such pursuits.

3183
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,540
How about Spencer Gregorian?

3184
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,040
The same goes for him, whoever he is.

3185
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,140
Funny.

3186
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,680
Because he described you to a key.

3187
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:32,340
I know, my gosh.

3188
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:34,640
Even down to that stupid little ponytail you got.

3189
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,280
It's called a chomagi.

3190
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:42,240
What would you say if I told you Gregorian named you as one of the people who was there when the Tyrell building blew up?

3191
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:45,120
There's a mistake somewhere along the chain of communication.

3192
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,720
So, you're denying all involvement?

3193
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,740
I won't lie to you, detective.

3194
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:54,120
There was a time in my life when I might have been involved in such an organization.

3195
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:56,000
I actually can.

3196
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,240
But now, all I care about is my business.

3197
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:02,320
I am nothing but a humble salesman.

3198
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:04,880
Perhaps I can interest you in this camera.

3199
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:05,480
The camera!

3200
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:08,200
A hundred years ago, it was a cherished idea.

3201
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:09,420
A hundred years ago.

3202
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:13,380
I've seen plenty of photographs in my time.

3203
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:16,440
I think cameras are still sought after.

3204
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:17,980
Wow!

3205
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:19,340
Flashbang!

3206
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:19,800
Wait.

3207
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,300
Uh-oh.

3208
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:23,440
Uh-oh.

3209
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,180
Take that.

3210
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:27,060
And we're going after him, baby!

3211
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:30,760
We're going after this guy!

3212
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:35,070
Whoa!

3213
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:37,550
Can I rob him blind?

3214
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:40,650
Oh!

3215
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:42,410
We're going down!

3216
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:46,930
Uh-oh!

3217
02:14:46,930 --> 02:14:46,950
Oh!

3218
02:14:47,150 --> 02:14:49,090
This looks... not good.

3219
02:14:49,610 --> 02:14:50,090
Wait.

3220
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:53,880
I'm exp... oh.

3221
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,920
There were off-world rifles here and more.

3222
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:00,240
Grenades, explosives, modern rifles, even some police issue restricted weaponry.

3223
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:03,580
Izo wasn't some small-time fence, but a big-time arms dealer.

3224
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:07,920
The exact arms that renegade replicants would be looking for to survive in the big city.

3225
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:10,380
Ooooooo...

3226
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:12,920
Ooooooo...

3227
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:13,940
Okay, I think we...

3228
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:15,000
This looks like it's...

3229
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:17,100
It's...

3230
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,040
What's the word?

3231
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:20,120
Interactable, but...

3232
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,980
Does not seem to be the case.

3233
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:22,180
Okay.

3234
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:23,320
Let's go with our...

3235
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,000
With our gun out!

3236
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:24,280
Come on!

3237
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:24,520
Wait!

3238
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:25,260
Oh!

3239
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:25,680
Oh!

3240
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:26,040
Oh!

3241
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:26,620
Oh!

3242
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:33,470
Izo!

3243
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:36,310
I'm ready to shoot!

3244
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:37,930
I'm scared!

3245
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:39,310
I'm scared, though!

3246
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:40,910
I'm ready to shoot.

3247
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:42,090
You come out!

3248
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:42,990
I practice!

3249
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:44,490
I have the highest score in the biz!

3250
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:46,190
What is this?

3251
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:47,850
Hmm.

3252
02:15:48,610 --> 02:15:48,930
Hmm.

3253
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:49,470
Okay.

3254
02:15:50,030 --> 02:15:51,690
I have the highest score in the biz!

3255
02:15:51,930 --> 02:15:53,090
You don't wanna mess with me!

3256
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,960
Has she saved?

3257
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,260
Oh, I have, but I probably should save again, huh?

3258
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,340
I'll save.

3259
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:07,580
I remember this!

3260
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:18,770
I remember this goopy area!

3261
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:20,430
But I don't remember.

3262
02:16:23,170 --> 02:16:24,410
How are you supposed to...

3263
02:16:24,410 --> 02:16:26,290
You go that way, but how do you get over there?

3264
02:16:27,670 --> 02:16:28,770
Or in there.

3265
02:16:29,330 --> 02:16:29,490
Hmm.

3266
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:31,910
Can't go this way.

3267
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,350
Let's go through here.

3268
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:34,910
That's...

3269
02:16:34,910 --> 02:16:35,670
Impossible.

3270
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:36,590
Just kidding.

3271
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:37,070
Okay.

3272
02:16:37,330 --> 02:16:38,250
Let's go this way.

3273
02:16:38,730 --> 02:16:38,850
Oh.

3274
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:39,770
That's...

3275
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:40,430
Impossible.

3276
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:43,090
Guys, it's impossible!

3277
02:16:43,390 --> 02:16:43,750
Pizza!

3278
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:45,870
Because you're the gifted!

3279
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:57,980
Maybe a different way.

3280
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:00,020
This way.

3281
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:01,420
This...

3282
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:01,760
Away.

3283
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:04,700
Well, where did our little friend go?

3284
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:15,610
I don't see anything to click on either.

3285
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:18,150
That's...

3286
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:18,890
Impossible.

3287
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:19,930
The ladder.

3288
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:20,210
Wait.

3289
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:21,030
Where do you see that?

3290
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:23,030
Ah!

3291
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:23,430
Hmm.

3292
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:24,970
Okay.

3293
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:25,550
Just kidding.

3294
02:17:28,550 --> 02:17:29,550
What ladder?

3295
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:32,530
You guys see a ladder?

3296
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:34,830
You guys have such good eyes.

3297
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:35,610
Where?

3298
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,530
Shoot the lever!

3299
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:44,790
It won't let me.

3300
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:54,260
Top left?

3301
02:17:58,720 --> 02:17:59,460
That's...

3302
02:17:59,460 --> 02:17:59,900
Impossible.

3303
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,810
Oh!

3304
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:07,610
This right here!

3305
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:09,410
Oh!

3306
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:10,110
My gosh!

3307
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:11,950
I barely saw that.

3308
02:18:12,830 --> 02:18:15,370
How the heck did you guys see that?

3309
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:18,590
Look at him go.

3310
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:22,870
I am not about to have all my hard work obliterated.

3311
02:18:22,910 --> 02:18:25,650
Just because you stumbled into my shop, detective.

3312
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:28,250
Westerners need guns and hardware.

3313
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:29,090
I don't have my gun out!

3314
02:18:29,330 --> 02:18:30,230
All I need is...

3315
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:31,530
This guy is just walking fast.

3316
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:32,590
With this...

3317
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:33,610
Freeze, Yoshi!

3318
02:18:35,390 --> 02:18:35,910
Easel.

3319
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:36,930
Whatever.

3320
02:18:37,630 --> 02:18:38,810
Been keeping yourself busy?

3321
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:40,830
I'll be out of lockup within the hour.

3322
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:45,650
Your little skin job friend's gonna take up a collection to bail you out, or you got it saved up?

3323
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:48,070
Maybe I got friends in high places.

3324
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:48,610
Hello!

3325
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:51,610
Yeah, and if my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle.

3326
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:53,530
What are you doing here, Slim?

3327
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:55,950
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

3328
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:56,150
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

3329
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:58,230
I've been tracking this boy for a week.

3330
02:18:58,470 --> 02:18:59,610
He thinks he's pretty clever.

3331
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:02,170
He's a material witness in a case I'm working.

3332
02:19:02,930 --> 02:19:05,490
In fact, your best buddy's a replicant, isn't he?

3333
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:07,470
The big guy with the dreadlocks.

3334
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:08,410
What's his name again?

3335
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:10,650
Hallucinate often?

3336
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:11,970
That's okay.

3337
02:19:12,830 --> 02:19:14,590
You'll be giving him up to me soon enough.

3338
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,970
I can handle it from here, Slim.

3339
02:19:17,230 --> 02:19:18,830
Why don't you go buy yourself a lollipop?

3340
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:20,390
Something else to suck on.

3341
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:21,830
Very clever.

3342
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:23,770
I'm the one who found him!

3343
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:28,370
Oh, he's just going with her.

3344
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:29,550
She didn't even lock him up.

3345
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:31,610
He's just walking along with her.

3346
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,190
Okay.

3347
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:38,570
Does this badge mean anything to you?

3348
02:19:39,010 --> 02:19:39,790
Clearly not.

3349
02:19:45,210 --> 02:19:46,030
Well, damn.

3350
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:54,000
I guess I will go get myself a lollipop.

3351
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:00,930
Maybe...

3352
02:20:01,570 --> 02:20:01,970
Uh...

3353
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:03,130
We can...

3354
02:20:03,130 --> 02:20:04,050
Dragonfly now.

3355
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,260
Can we go to the lockup?

3356
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,280
I think we can.

3357
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,320
But before we do that...

3358
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:16,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3359
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:17,580
What is this?

3360
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:18,580
Oh, just kidding.

3361
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:21,760
I thought it was something.

3362
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:21,800
I thought it was something.

3363
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:23,520
We grabbed a couple things too.

3364
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,500
We grabbed the camera.

3365
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:27,660
We grabbed some papers that were on the ground.

3366
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:30,720
But everything...

3367
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,040
I wish it was in the order of...

3368
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:34,840
Of...

3369
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:36,700
When you picked it up and not in alphabetical.

3370
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:39,020
It's my birthday!

3371
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,440
Synthesis, happy birthday!

3372
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:44,340
Thank you so much for the super chat!

3373
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,200
Happy, happy birthday!

3374
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:49,980
Uh...

3375
02:20:49,980 --> 02:20:51,200
Okay, maybe I...

3376
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:53,380
Oh, source easel!

3377
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:55,860
We got this picture.

3378
02:20:55,860 --> 02:20:56,520
Okay.

3379
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:58,520
Um...

3380
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,220
I'm gonna start getting like...

3381
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:00,440
I'm gonna steal.

3382
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,220
Batch number BR61354.

3383
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:06,420
Still working the explosion of the Tyrell manufacturing plant.

3384
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:10,880
It'll take a day or so to analyze the debris, but there's no doubt in my mind that we're dealing with a bomb here.

3385
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:11,580
One lollipop.

3386
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:14,180
Right now, it looks like the protesters had nothing to do with it.

3387
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:17,000
They were in too close proximity to have been in on Zeal.

3388
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,340
No MO's or identities are rolling up just yet.

3389
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:23,900
And I'm still going through the inset files to see if any replicate munitions experts are unaccounted for.

3390
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:30,800
I'm gonna go through all the clues so that when we do get something new, we know it'll be lit up, you know?

3391
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:34,100
The detonator wire I pulled out of his skull told the whole story.

3392
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:36,600
But I wondered why the killer didn't just shoot him.

3393
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,700
The dog collar has a name on it.

3394
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,300
The dog collar has a name on it.

3395
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:44,200
We have dog collar lowercase c and dog collar capital C.

3396
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,460
The dog collar has a name on it.

3397
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,560
Ricky's earring was shaped like an insect.

3398
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:49,840
I didn't know much about jewelry, but it looked like junk.

3399
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:51,000
While we do that, I'm gonna...

3400
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:52,760
Okay.

3401
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:56,380
Looks your rep swung that moon bus massacre last month.

3402
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,100
They ever find the moon bus?

3403
02:21:58,260 --> 02:21:58,660
The moon bus.

3404
02:21:58,660 --> 02:21:59,700
Disappeared in the thin air.

3405
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:03,120
Ryan thinks it crashed out in the kipple.

3406
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:03,700
The kipple.

3407
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:07,680
I'm gonna lower the volume so that you guys don't have to hear the beep.

3408
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:11,680
Judging from the distance between the prints, I was looking for two very big men.

3409
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:15,460
One dragged his right foot, indicating a possible injury or lameness.

3410
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:18,500
The other appeared a lot more controlled, graceful even.

3411
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:19,620
Quite a pair.

3412
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:23,980
Kingston kitchens.

3413
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:25,100
Where have I heard that before?

3414
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:27,740
Most of them were shot point blank, but we're looking at some others.

3415
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:29,800
Sloppy cuts with a knife.

3416
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,900
Like the pert was really pissed off at something.

3417
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,900
That black paint you found on the fire hydrant...

3418
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:34,760
I remember this.

3419
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:36,080
It's from a ground car.

3420
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:40,220
This is Crystal Steel badge number BR-61354.

3421
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:43,160
Conducting the interrogation of Spencer Gregorian.

3422
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:44,080
Spencer Gregorian.

3423
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:46,460
Who requires citizens against replicant slavery.

3424
02:22:47,140 --> 02:22:48,780
November 22nd, 2019.

3425
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,820
I once again ask that my attorney...

3426
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,020
Shut it, shitbird.

3427
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,540
I'm asking the questions.

3428
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:54,640
I'm asking the questions.

3429
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:58,100
We've already put you on the machine, so we know you're not a skin job.

3430
02:22:58,400 --> 02:22:59,600
That term offends me.

3431
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:03,780
Okay, so you're not one of those biomechanical scumbags.

3432
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:06,400
You claim to not know anything about the bombing at Tyrell.

3433
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:07,560
This is true.

3434
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:10,080
We advocate equal rights under the law of the replicants.

3435
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:10,940
This guy sounds like such nerds.

3436
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:13,580
We have nothing against Tyrell Corporation for creating them.

3437
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,380
Tyrell.

3438
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:15,360
That's some sick logic.

3439
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:19,680
The replicants are living organisms whether people like you like it or not.

3440
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:23,900
Replicants contribute greatly to the economic well-being of our culture.

3441
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:25,680
They cannot be discounted as such.

3442
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,540
Hell, it'd be no skin off my nose if each and every one of them was hosed down for good.

3443
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:31,700
You ever see this guy?

3444
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:32,200
White.

3445
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,240
Yes.

3446
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:34,720
Actually, I have.

3447
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:36,020
Actually, I have.

3448
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:36,760
He was present at the protest.

3449
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:40,000
He's not part of our group, but outsiders are usually welcome.

3450
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:42,140
How many new faces showed up that day?

3451
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,060
Not too many.

3452
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,260
A handful at most.

3453
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:45,760
Describe them to me.

3454
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:47,060
I don't know if I can.

3455
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:47,820
Oh, no?

3456
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:50,680
Recording off.

3457
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,560
Describe them for me again.

3458
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:56,480
There was that Rastafarian fellow and one of our ex-members showed up.

3459
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:57,300
Who's that?

3460
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,200
A Japanese man named Izo.

3461
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:00,300
Why'd you get rid of us?

3462
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:03,280
We're a pacifist organization and we have rules.

3463
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:06,200
One of them is no weapons allowed.

3464
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:07,560
Oh, Izo broke that.

3465
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:10,120
Izo refused to check in his samurai sword at the door during meetings.

3466
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:12,100
Where can I find this Izo?

3467
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:14,880
He owns one of those little second-hand stores downtown.

3468
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:18,860
Izo has all the guns in the world and he was using his little samurai sword.

3469
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:22,140
We have a number of anonymous donors.

3470
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:24,640
People with resources and sources.

3471
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:26,140
Such as?

3472
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,740
So anonymous even I don't know who they are.

3473
02:24:29,140 --> 02:24:30,160
I almost believe you.

3474
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,460
Let's check this out.

3475
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,260
How long has that chef worked for you?

3476
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:34,940
Zubin?

3477
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:35,840
Just month?

3478
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,460
Oh, yeah, we know this one.

3479
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,260
Alright, hold on.

3480
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:42,060
Pain transfer.

3481
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,300
Peruvian lady.

3482
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:45,800
Oh, we know this one.

3483
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,680
There's a photo of McCoy.

3484
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:55,340
That's the... Oh my gosh, we have a McCoy checky!

3485
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,220
That's when he took in my picture right before he ran.

3486
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:06,720
As a weeaboo, it is your duty to go back to Izo's room and confiscate his katana.

3487
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:07,860
I think he took it with him.

3488
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:11,240
Wait, is it actually in there though?

3489
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:11,900
That'd be awesome.

3490
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:21,740
Okay, this is this guy from the pet store.

3491
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:23,620
We never found Lucy.

3492
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:24,960
Lucy!

3493
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:25,380
Lucy!

3494
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,020
This game meshes the movie with the novel.

3495
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:30,940
Kipple is the term from the book that means useless junk.

3496
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:33,120
But all things wrought into.

3497
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:33,760
Neat.

3498
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,820
It was a Tyrell sales brochure for the Nexus series.

3499
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:36,840
Tyrell.

3500
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:37,900
Okay, yeah, we saw that.

3501
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,240
The security photo.

3502
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:40,300
We got that.

3503
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:41,760
We got that.

3504
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,860
We got that.

3505
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:43,460
We got that.

3506
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:43,720
Okay.

3507
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,540
So that's the weapons form.

3508
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:47,900
That's what we...

3509
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,120
And the weapons catch.

3510
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:50,260
There were four rifles here and more.

3511
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:54,580
Grenades, explosives, modern rifles, even some police issue restricted weaponry.

3512
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:54,960
Okay.

3513
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,640
Alright, so we've gone through all of our evidence.

3514
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:57,160
But a big...

3515
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:58,160
Very nice.

3516
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:00,060
Let's go talk to her real quick.

3517
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:01,560
And then...

3518
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,520
Where are we going?

3519
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:07,140
Rose, by definition, can never be skin jobs.

3520
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:08,060
You are.

3521
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:09,020
I have...

3522
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:10,320
I have fake skin!

3523
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:14,260
You hear anything yet about that dragonfly jewelry, like what I showed you before?

3524
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:15,760
No, senor.

3525
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,820
My friend, he's asking for me.

3526
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:23,000
Do you know that David Cage said that the Troy become human was like Blade Runner, except we're supposed to sympathize with the robots.

3527
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:26,380
Actually, I've been thinking about that game this whole time.

3528
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,660
Digital green women tempt me.

3529
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,520
We can be quite tempted.

3530
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:39,000
I was fresh out of Leeds.

3531
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:41,560
Poking around Hawker's circle had been a waste of time.

3532
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:45,100
I had nothing to connect this Ezo character to the Eisenduller murder.

3533
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:50,000
But if the replicants had done in one Tyrell scientist, maybe they'd go after another.

3534
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:55,040
And the subcontractors down on DNA Row didn't have Tyrell's security to protect them.

3535
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:57,780
A pet.

3536
02:26:58,220 --> 02:26:59,720
I love your voiceover.

3537
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:05,000
So we're going to...

3538
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,780
DNA Row, baby.

3539
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:11,020
DNA.

3540
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:11,800
DNA.

3541
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:15,140
I wonder what's here.

3542
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:16,580
28 stabbing.

3543
02:27:27,270 --> 02:27:29,460
The ambience is so...

3544
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:35,310
Why do I...

3545
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,210
I feel a little anxious right now.

3546
02:27:40,210 --> 02:27:40,290
Oh.

3547
02:27:43,610 --> 02:27:44,990
We can go in there.

3548
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:47,730
Oh, that's all where we can go.

3549
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:48,170
Okay.

3550
02:27:48,690 --> 02:27:48,890
Let's go.

3551
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:49,450
Not good time now.

3552
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:50,050
Come back later.

3553
02:27:50,490 --> 02:27:50,810
Oh.

3554
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,730
He's mumbling in Chinese.

3555
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:57,970
Wait!

3556
02:27:58,110 --> 02:27:58,850
Hannibal too!

3557
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:01,070
Is this Hannibal?

3558
02:28:02,650 --> 02:28:03,570
Can someone translate?

3559
02:28:06,130 --> 02:28:07,630
This has to be Hannibal.

3560
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:11,690
He's looking for someone.

3561
02:28:12,810 --> 02:28:13,710
Is that what he's saying?

3562
02:28:15,550 --> 02:28:16,370
I'm looking around.

3563
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:16,790
Wait.

3564
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:17,730
Excuse me.

3565
02:28:18,210 --> 02:28:18,370
Oh.

3566
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:19,590
Deliveries to Rare.

3567
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:22,130
LPD, I got a couple of questions.

3568
02:28:22,930 --> 02:28:23,070
Hmm.

3569
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,810
Talk, talk, talk.

3570
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:24,350
Always talk.

3571
02:28:24,750 --> 02:28:25,170
You wake.

3572
02:28:25,390 --> 02:28:26,150
You don't take up time.

3573
02:28:26,490 --> 02:28:27,050
Busy, busy.

3574
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:27,750
Talk, talk, talk.

3575
02:28:27,810 --> 02:28:29,150
Marcus Eisenduller is dead.

3576
02:28:29,950 --> 02:28:30,430
Uh, okay.

3577
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:31,310
We talk.

3578
02:28:31,970 --> 02:28:32,630
Quick, quick, pal.

3579
02:28:33,270 --> 02:28:33,810
What you want?

3580
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:37,210
Um, I want a...

3581
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:38,990
You were close to Eisenduller?

3582
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:39,410
Yeah.

3583
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:40,330
Eisenduller?

3584
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:41,230
Haha, no, no.

3585
02:28:41,310 --> 02:28:42,230
No time for him.

3586
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:43,670
No go to a lab.

3587
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:46,630
Eisenduller tests off world gravity.

3588
02:28:46,830 --> 02:28:46,970
Yeah.

3589
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:49,510
To work important organs.

3590
02:28:50,490 --> 02:28:52,370
Visual center, you see?

3591
02:28:52,570 --> 02:28:53,350
Completely different.

3592
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:54,270
Marcus is dead.

3593
02:28:54,650 --> 02:28:56,590
To work hard all night, all day.

3594
02:28:56,730 --> 02:28:58,410
No stop, no break, no OT.

3595
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:59,770
Voice by James Hall.

3596
02:28:59,790 --> 02:29:00,170
Did you hear me?

3597
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:00,690
Oh.

3598
02:29:00,910 --> 02:29:01,910
Of course I hear you.

3599
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:03,210
You think I'm deaf?

3600
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:06,590
Your time more important, huh?

3601
02:29:07,470 --> 02:29:08,290
Eisenduller dead.

3602
02:29:08,290 --> 02:29:08,390
Maraji may be dead.

3603
02:29:08,830 --> 02:29:10,070
Maraji may be dead.

3604
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:11,390
You out chasing skirts.

3605
02:29:12,610 --> 02:29:13,130
Maraji?

3606
02:29:13,690 --> 02:29:15,370
You eat supper with Maraji.

3607
02:29:15,690 --> 02:29:16,530
Every night, no fail.

3608
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:19,030
Sometimes Chinese, sometimes Indian, sometimes home cook.

3609
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:21,930
Sometimes we go up and eat with twins.

3610
02:29:22,270 --> 02:29:22,730
Twins?

3611
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:23,870
Maraji didn't show.

3612
02:29:24,030 --> 02:29:24,650
Did you call him?

3613
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:25,730
Call?

3614
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:26,430
No, I knock.

3615
02:29:26,650 --> 02:29:28,570
Ten minutes ago, door locked.

3616
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:29,850
No answer.

3617
02:29:30,490 --> 02:29:32,370
Where'd you come from, huh?

3618
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:33,210
What?

3619
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:34,150
Nothing.

3620
02:29:34,490 --> 02:29:34,610
Nothing.

3621
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:36,150
Huh?

3622
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:37,810
Tell me this.

3623
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:39,330
Hey, wait.

3624
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:39,970
LPT.

3625
02:29:40,110 --> 02:29:41,050
You there for something, huh?

3626
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:41,590
LPT?

3627
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:42,890
I'm very busy.

3628
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:44,250
Eis won't wait for nothing.

3629
02:29:45,210 --> 02:29:47,510
I'm a-a-a-b-b-b-b-b-the twins.

3630
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:50,830
Okay.

3631
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,330
Is that all we got?

3632
02:29:52,350 --> 02:29:52,850
Tell me this.

3633
02:29:53,470 --> 02:29:54,390
Hey, wait.

3634
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:55,170
I'm very busy.

3635
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:56,350
That's all we get from him.

3636
02:29:56,910 --> 02:29:57,070
Alright.

3637
02:30:00,330 --> 02:30:00,810
Interesting.

3638
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:05,390
Uh, nothing else around here, I think?

3639
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:10,540
Mm-hmm.

3640
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:11,240
Oh, wait.

3641
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:12,620
What's over here?

3642
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:21,000
I can't read it.

3643
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:21,860
It's so bright.

3644
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:25,620
We can go up.

3645
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:28,660
Or we can go through the front door.

3646
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,860
Let's try the front door.

3647
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:31,320
Ooh.

3648
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,300
What's going on?

3649
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,380
Who did this?

3650
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:34,020
Oh.

3651
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:34,700
Help me, sir.

3652
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:36,840
Please, help me.

3653
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:38,460
It is going to blow.

3654
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:39,800
What's happening?

3655
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:40,620
Who?

3656
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:42,220
No, no, no!

3657
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:43,340
Wait, what's hap- what?

3658
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:45,320
What's gonna blow?

3659
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:46,320
What's behind that door there?

3660
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:47,700
Are you crazy?

3661
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:49,460
That's a bomb on the chair.

3662
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:50,560
Oh, there is?

3663
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:51,360
This?

3664
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:51,780
Wait.

3665
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:53,660
Maybe I can disarm it.

3666
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:54,100
No!

3667
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,720
There is no time!

3668
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:57,340
And he said, if you touch it!

3669
02:30:57,620 --> 02:30:58,880
Oh, it's gonna explode.

3670
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:06,860
I didn't touch it.

3671
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:07,800
I didn't touch it.

3672
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:08,560
Oh.

3673
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,500
It was all a dream.

3674
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,820
Should have taken the stairs.

3675
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:20,840
So much for trying to be a good citizen and going through the front door.

3676
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:30,920
Wait, but... Oh, gosh.

3677
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,540
Where is it?

3678
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:34,060
Where did it put me back at?

3679
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:35,580
Now I think about it.

3680
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:38,640
Hold on.

3681
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:39,500
Let's run here.

3682
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:42,740
And then... touch.

3683
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:44,100
No!

3684
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:49,550
All of my... wait.

3685
02:31:50,750 --> 02:31:52,050
Where am... what?

3686
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,640
I don't know where it put us back.

3687
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:05,140
Hold on.

3688
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:05,820
Let me load.

3689
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:08,740
We can probably load from the sewers.

3690
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:13,280
I'd have to just backtrack a little bit here.

3691
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:15,640
I think.

3692
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:19,560
So here, this is right before we went up the ladder.

3693
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:20,120
Okay.

3694
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:22,480
I'll just skip it.

3695
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,680
Yeah, we'll just speed through this part.

3696
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:35,200
I am not about to have all my heart just...

3697
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,040
Oh!

3698
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:37,040
Freeze, Yoshi!

3699
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:38,720
With his katana.

3700
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,880
Can I talk to him?

3701
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:45,080
No.

3702
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:45,520
Okay.

3703
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:46,980
Alright, now...

3704
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:49,140
Um...

3705
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:50,540
I go back...

3706
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:52,080
Through here.

3707
02:32:54,980 --> 02:32:58,920
And we have our little inner monologue where we're like, I'm out of leads.

3708
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,540
But first, I'm gonna grab a drink.

3709
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:05,280
I think I deserve one.

3710
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:06,660
Pour me one.

3711
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:08,040
Just one?

3712
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:09,000
Yeah.

3713
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:10,040
One, but one good one.

3714
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:11,300
One, but one good one.

3715
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:15,920
I wonder if that actually costs money.

3716
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:19,220
If I'm just blowing my savings at this place.

3717
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:22,180
We'll never get Maggie a...

3718
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:23,380
A partner.

3719
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:23,700
Wait!

3720
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:25,940
Is this katana in here?

3721
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:28,400
For real?

3722
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:31,900
14K!

3723
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:52,130
I am the owner of the one and only 14K Laboobo.

3724
02:33:54,130 --> 02:33:54,770
Alright.

3725
02:33:55,130 --> 02:33:56,550
Once we get to...

3726
02:33:57,810 --> 02:33:58,450
DNA...

3727
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:02,790
We'll talk to the one guy, and then I'll save.

3728
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:13,240
Okey-dokey.

3729
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:16,440
What's a labubu?

3730
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,820
It's like a little plush.

3731
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:22,640
Oh my gosh, I touched a labubu for the first time.

3732
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:24,280
I was in Japan.

3733
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:28,440
And my friend had one.

3734
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:32,140
And I was like, oh my gosh, can I see her labubu?

3735
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,160
She was like, it was a gift to me.

3736
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:39,200
So I feel like, you know... How did it feel?

3737
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:39,900
It was cute.

3738
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,740
I actually kind of liked them.

3739
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:44,440
Tell me that... Okay.

3740
02:34:44,820 --> 02:34:50,600
Alright, now... We go... Back.

3741
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:54,740
Then over here.

3742
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:57,160
And now I'm gonna save.

3743
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:04,220
Okay, let's go upstairs.

3744
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:11,060
I too prefer my women with green eyes.

3745
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:12,120
My eyes are blue!

3746
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:17,340
Blue no good for you?

3747
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:18,580
Wait.

3748
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:20,340
This thing moves, doesn't it?

3749
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:20,680
Ah!

3750
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:22,020
Ah!

3751
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:25,620
Shut up.

3752
02:35:28,660 --> 02:35:29,660
Yeah, I remember.

3753
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:33,780
I recognized the logo on the envelope.

3754
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:36,040
It was definitely Runciter's animal sales.

3755
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:38,740
But I didn't expect to find hundreds of chin-yan inside.

3756
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:39,960
I didn't know what it was for.

3757
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:42,520
But I'd bet the farm it wasn't on Runciter's books.

3758
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:49,420
This thing used to scare the crap out of me.

3759
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,120
And I was a wee wisp.

3760
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:56,700
So are we just gonna... We don't need to worry about the...

3761
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,120
The bomb... If we're in here.

3762
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:03,580
He says, yep.

3763
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:05,000
You're okay to...

3764
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,380
Oh, I broke it.

3765
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:06,880
Oops.

3766
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:21,920
I didn't know you could do that.

3767
02:36:23,940 --> 02:36:26,180
Is it gonna explode while we're walking?

3768
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:27,060
That'd be crazy.

3769
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:28,320
Okay.

3770
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:30,400
Save again.

3771
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,060
And

3772
02:36:35,250 --> 02:36:35,850
blow it up!

3773
02:36:35,990 --> 02:36:36,610
What's going on?

3774
02:36:36,750 --> 02:36:37,670
Who did this?

3775
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:38,990
Help me, sir.

3776
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:41,130
Please, help me.

3777
02:36:41,390 --> 02:36:42,730
It is going to blow.

3778
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:54,000
You don't shoot the bomb.

3779
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,820
What's going on?

3780
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:08,900
Who did this?

3781
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,180
Help me, sir.

3782
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,340
Can I shoot right here?

3783
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,560
Isn't this a...

3784
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,220
Like a handcuff?

3785
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,160
I'm clicking.

3786
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:20,220
Run!

3787
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:20,900
Run!

3788
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:22,380
Oh!

3789
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:23,640
Run?

3790
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:28,920
Look at him go!

3791
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:32,450
Oh, I got an achievement.

3792
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:34,030
Escape the bomb explosion.

3793
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:34,730
Let's go.

3794
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:38,570
You good?

3795
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:41,670
Hold on.

3796
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:42,830
An ambulance will be coming.

3797
02:37:43,290 --> 02:37:45,890
You must warn the twins.

3798
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:46,770
The twins!

3799
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:49,530
It's good detective work, Lieutenant Minky.

3800
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,550
Thank you!

3801
02:37:50,890 --> 02:37:51,670
The stairs.

3802
02:37:52,610 --> 02:37:53,390
The twins?

3803
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:54,230
Did they do this?

3804
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:55,770
No.

3805
02:37:56,990 --> 02:37:59,390
Tall bed with...

3806
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:00,690
...redlocks.

3807
02:38:01,370 --> 02:38:02,690
The bomber.

3808
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:03,670
The bomber!

3809
02:38:04,030 --> 02:38:07,890
And another with beard.

3810
02:38:08,070 --> 02:38:09,370
Wasn't the guy at the beginning with the beard?

3811
02:38:09,570 --> 02:38:10,810
Piercing eyes.

3812
02:38:11,290 --> 02:38:12,590
That was a big brain solution.

3813
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:13,250
Hot dog.

3814
02:38:13,830 --> 02:38:14,270
Thanks.

3815
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:16,970
TNA information.

3816
02:38:18,250 --> 02:38:18,850
Don't...

3817
02:38:22,350 --> 02:38:23,930
Oh, it's Moragy.

3818
02:38:24,050 --> 02:38:24,650
I just noticed.

3819
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:27,610
Oh, you ratted him out.

3820
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:29,330
Don't shoot.

3821
02:38:30,190 --> 02:38:30,990
McCoy, rep detect.

3822
02:38:31,150 --> 02:38:32,750
BR-61-661.

3823
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,790
Sex...

3824
02:38:33,790 --> 02:38:34,890
Oh, dang.

3825
02:38:35,250 --> 02:38:36,130
What do you know about this?

3826
02:38:36,610 --> 02:38:37,670
Got a dead man here.

3827
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:38,930
Victim of an explosion.

3828
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:41,830
His name is, uh, was, Moragy.

3829
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:45,630
He was able to give me a description of the two perks just before he bought the farm.

3830
02:38:46,330 --> 02:38:46,590
Yeah?

3831
02:38:47,170 --> 02:38:48,150
They skin jobs?

3832
02:38:48,290 --> 02:38:50,330
Or are you just in the right place at the wrong time?

3833
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:52,670
I'm practically waxing their tails, officer.

3834
02:38:52,830 --> 02:38:53,430
I'm that close.

3835
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:55,130
But I don't have a lot of time.

3836
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:56,670
You mind, uh...

3837
02:38:56,670 --> 02:38:57,390
Mop it up here?

3838
02:38:58,170 --> 02:39:00,770
Just do me a favor and kick some rep ass, okay?

3839
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:03,870
It's high time someone got them illegals off the street.

3840
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:05,310
Appreciate it.

3841
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:08,230
This is 32, sector 3, reporting a homicide.

3842
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:11,170
Can you turn your mic down, Officer Grayford, please?

3843
02:39:12,630 --> 02:39:13,610
Goodness gracious.

3844
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:15,870
You got a sheet or something we could cover him with?

3845
02:39:16,570 --> 02:39:17,390
Nah, nothing.

3846
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:19,930
Cold Cup boys have been dragging ass.

3847
02:39:21,690 --> 02:39:22,810
Don't miss anything.

3848
02:39:23,210 --> 02:39:25,030
There ain't nothing left, detective.

3849
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:27,890
Can we go back in there?

3850
02:39:30,650 --> 02:39:31,530
Oh, we can.

3851
02:39:31,830 --> 02:39:32,450
Wait, hold on.

3852
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:34,190
Can I say it again?

3853
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:39,980
Yuck.

3854
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:42,240
So true.

3855
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:44,920
Slappy.

3856
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:48,840
Oh.

3857
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:52,880
If my instincts were right, he was the same Joker who lit up the Tyrell building.

3858
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:54,580
Dangerous, but still an amateur.

3859
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:58,460
The plot keeps thickening like some sort of detective story.

3860
02:39:59,140 --> 02:39:59,780
Wee-woo.

3861
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:04,260
Is there anything in here or has it all been blown to hell?

3862
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:05,960
Locked.

3863
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:07,220
No way through here.

3864
02:40:08,020 --> 02:40:09,320
You don't know that.

3865
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:10,260
It was...

3866
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:11,600
Hmm.

3867
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:14,020
I guess not.

3868
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:16,540
Okay.

3869
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:19,540
Let's go upstairs to the twins, I suppose?

3870
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,880
We were already up there, but he says to go again.

3871
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,040
Slap.

3872
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:30,180
Oh, this thing is still going.

3873
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:31,620
Oh my gosh.

3874
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:33,020
Scared me.

3875
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:36,000
Oh, twins!

3876
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:39,000
Twins!

3877
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:43,140
The vid phone was one of those old Zenith jobs.

3878
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:46,100
The last electronic tech that was still produced on this continent.

3879
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:47,580
In Mexico, to be exact.

3880
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:49,160
No wonder the sucker was on the blink.

3881
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:52,920
Won't let me.

3882
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,480
I wish I could shoot everything.

3883
02:40:57,340 --> 02:40:59,220
I thought that was like a person out there.

3884
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:04,120
Yeah, that seems to be it in here.

3885
02:41:04,420 --> 02:41:04,540
Wait.

3886
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:05,200
Hmm.

3887
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:06,440
I never...

3888
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:06,580
Nope.

3889
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:07,080
Yep.

3890
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:28,050
Oh, whoops.

3891
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:29,730
Uh, click on me.

3892
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:33,370
Okay, give me a second.

3893
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:34,650
I'm going to go through these...

3894
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:34,790
Wait.

3895
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:36,770
The guy who set the bomb had been sloppy.

3896
02:41:36,970 --> 02:41:38,830
He kept the charge small enough to leave the wall.

3897
02:41:39,070 --> 02:41:40,090
Of course I hear you.

3898
02:41:40,270 --> 02:41:40,650
Yeah.

3899
02:41:41,730 --> 02:41:42,170
Uh.

3900
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:44,930
This is Crystal Steel.

3901
02:41:44,990 --> 02:41:45,910
The detonator wire.

3902
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:47,230
We already went through them.

3903
02:41:47,390 --> 02:41:47,790
I reckon...

3904
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:48,030
I checked.

3905
02:41:48,270 --> 02:41:50,070
Judging from the distance between the print...

3906
02:41:50,070 --> 02:41:50,330
This is...

3907
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:50,910
Describe them.

3908
02:41:51,050 --> 02:41:52,050
How long a king's...

3909
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:54,410
Most of them had black paint you found on the fly hydrant.

3910
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:55,290
Judging from the...

3911
02:41:55,290 --> 02:41:55,490
Oh.

3912
02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:56,110
No!

3913
02:41:56,470 --> 02:41:56,910
Okay.

3914
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:57,850
The guy...

3915
02:41:57,850 --> 02:41:58,550
The bomber.

3916
02:41:59,130 --> 02:41:59,770
Scratches and paint.

3917
02:41:59,950 --> 02:42:00,030
See?

3918
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:01,330
One at a...

3919
02:42:01,330 --> 02:42:02,830
She came to me with a ref...

3920
02:42:02,830 --> 02:42:04,190
And there's not a lot...

3921
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:05,070
It was a...

3922
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:05,950
Most of...

3923
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:06,950
There were off-world rifles.

3924
02:42:07,290 --> 02:42:07,490
Okay.

3925
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:08,150
There we go.

3926
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:15,000
Sorry.

3927
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,360
Now I feel like I'm safe scumming.

3928
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:18,920
Um...

3929
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:21,000
So it said warn the twins.

3930
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,100
But how do I get to them?

3931
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:27,180
But we also saw...

3932
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:28,140
The thing about...

3933
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:28,980
The animals.

3934
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:30,240
So let's...

3935
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:30,340
Oh.

3936
02:42:31,300 --> 02:42:32,460
Maybe we head back here.

3937
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:39,410
Talk to Hannibal again.

3938
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:39,970
I guess we...

3939
02:42:39,970 --> 02:42:40,830
I should have done that.

3940
02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:42,610
I thought about it and then I forgot.

3941
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:44,630
Locked.

3942
02:42:44,630 --> 02:42:45,430
What still?

3943
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:48,230
But there was evidence there.

3944
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:57,460
We just had a bomb.

3945
02:42:58,820 --> 02:42:59,680
Who are you?

3946
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:00,200
Wait.

3947
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:02,940
Hey.

3948
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:03,720
Hey.

3949
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,580
You killed anyone yet?

3950
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:07,960
Hey.

3951
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:10,300
Go home and get some rest.

3952
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:12,300
I'm sure you need it.

3953
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:13,320
Why are you here?

3954
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:17,500
Hey, that guy has a cane.

3955
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:24,440
Wasn't one of the things that said there was a part here that killed the animals?

3956
02:43:24,600 --> 02:43:25,480
One guy had a limp?

3957
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:35,800
In a game where completely random bombs blow you up, I think an occasional saving is more than justified.

3958
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:45,320
Why is Gaff obsessed with killing Ryan?

3959
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:48,060
Am I going to get ambushed here again?

3960
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:48,660
I'm scared.

3961
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:53,220
I can't trust anything here.

3962
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,500
David, thank you so much for the super chat.

3963
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,120
Don't feel bad about saves coming.

3964
02:43:57,260 --> 02:44:00,920
It helps consider how some relevant evidences and factors may change for a playthrough.

3965
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,000
Thanks for helping me out, too.

3966
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:07,420
I think he's...

3967
02:44:07,420 --> 02:44:09,400
I feel like he said go get some rest.

3968
02:44:09,740 --> 02:44:12,120
I'm going to go see if maybe we start act three.

3969
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:15,400
If we sleep, you know?

3970
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:17,280
Maybe if it'll...

3971
02:44:18,380 --> 02:44:18,860
Maggie!

3972
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:22,740
Maggie, let me speak.

3973
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:23,380
Maggie.

3974
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:24,100
Maggie.

3975
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:25,380
Maggie.

3976
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:26,540
Good doggy.

3977
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:28,020
Maggie, shut up.

3978
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,760
Here you go, baby.

3979
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:31,580
Dinner time.

3980
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:32,820
She's hungry.

3981
02:44:33,380 --> 02:44:35,000
She's like, I haven't seen you all day.

3982
02:44:35,220 --> 02:44:35,480
Here you go, baby.

3983
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:36,320
Dinner time.

3984
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:36,800
There you go.

3985
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:37,120
Okay.

3986
02:44:43,890 --> 02:44:45,610
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

3987
02:44:45,890 --> 02:44:47,590
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

3988
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:52,570
I love how pixely he is compared to everywhere else in his apartment.

3989
02:44:53,570 --> 02:44:54,210
Okay, no.

3990
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:55,990
Not act three yet.

3991
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:01,790
Let's go talk to Hannibal.

3992
02:45:02,990 --> 02:45:03,970
Hannibal Chu.

3993
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:07,410
Your floor number, please.

3994
02:45:08,850 --> 02:45:11,110
The portrait of an Epee boy.

3995
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:12,950
Oof.

3996
02:45:14,750 --> 02:45:15,270
Oof.

3997
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:25,240
Going as best as a kid.

3998
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:30,440
What makes Maggie special is that she might just be the only real dog in LA since pets are a luxury.

3999
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:34,760
Well, she is now because all the pets at the...

4000
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:36,860
At the animal...

4001
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:39,480
At the animal...

4002
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:43,200
The animal store were all murdered, so...

4003
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:45,400
Yeah, probably now she is.

4004
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:59,180
If the game tells you that the bomber's an amateur, then he's probably a human.

4005
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:02,880
It says he's had military training and it's likely he's a replicant.

4006
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:05,240
I saw someone mention that earlier.

4007
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:06,140
How, like...

4008
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:08,420
How...

4009
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:08,640
Oh.

4010
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:09,420
What you do, huh?

4011
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:10,380
Hold on, I'll say after.

4012
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:12,080
Oh, that, uh...

4013
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:18,040
The game kind of randomizes who's replicants and who's humans?

4014
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:20,420
So that each playthrough is a little different?

4015
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:22,480
Like, that's so cool, no?

4016
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:23,320
Listen to me.

4017
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:24,480
Busy, busy.

4018
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:25,980
You're not delivery man.

4019
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,700
You go away.

4020
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:30,420
A distraction all day long.

4021
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:32,020
Never stop.

4022
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:34,640
Loud noises on the street.

4023
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:36,440
Beep, beep, bock, bock, bock.

4024
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:40,340
Beep, beep, bock, bock, bock.�ng Beep, beep, bock, bock, bock.

4025
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:42,340
That'd be Dermo Design Burning to the ground.

4026
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:43,500
Oh?

4027
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:46,020
Beep, beep, bock, bock, bock.

4028
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:47,320
What of Marazzi?

4029
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:48,900
He didn't make it.

4030
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:50,960
You leave now, okay?

4031
02:46:51,580 --> 02:46:52,220
Very busy.

4032
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:53,380
Must work.

4033
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:54,940
Must work.

4034
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:57,840
Uh,

4035
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:02,460
twins.

4036
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:03,540
You mentioned twins.

4037
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:04,840
Yes, yes.

4038
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,100
Luther and Lance.

4039
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:07,120
Siamese twins.

4040
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:08,320
Live about Miraji.

4041
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:10,000
They're genetic designers?

4042
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:13,200
Well, till last month.

4043
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:14,760
Got the boot, the shit camp.

4044
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:16,060
From who?

4045
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:17,720
Big boss, who else?

4046
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:18,560
Anybody tell them?

4047
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:19,900
Go ask them.

4048
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:21,560
I waste no more time.

4049
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:24,180
You think I nose around everybody's business, huh?

4050
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:31,140
Yeah, each playthrough is designed to be different, which is wild for a game.

4051
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:31,540
Right?

4052
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:34,960
Miraji.

4053
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:36,960
Miraji's some kind of DNA designer?

4054
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,680
Yeah, subcontractor like me.

4055
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:41,580
He's funny, though.

4056
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:43,400
Like old movies.

4057
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:45,560
Miraji, master chef.

4058
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:46,520
Wow.

4059
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:48,200
Twins go crazy when he cooks.

4060
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:52,040
What about this Lance?

4061
02:47:52,620 --> 02:47:53,500
What kind of guy is he?

4062
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:55,400
Why, he's like Luther.

4063
02:47:55,660 --> 02:47:56,280
Only different.

4064
02:47:56,720 --> 02:47:57,700
Don't know which which.

4065
02:47:58,540 --> 02:47:59,080
That so?

4066
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:00,620
One long hair.

4067
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:01,380
Talk a lot.

4068
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:03,260
Always make deals.

4069
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,900
Other more quiet.

4070
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:06,300
Work much harder.

4071
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:07,040
Okay.

4072
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:07,920
What kind of deals?

4073
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:09,660
Sell this, sell that.

4074
02:48:09,820 --> 02:48:10,580
No matter what weather.

4075
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:12,080
Like salesman.

4076
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:13,860
Very hard to take.

4077
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:14,920
No trust, no way.

4078
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:17,180
Did Lance sell something to Runciter?

4079
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:17,740
No.

4080
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:18,020
Who?

4081
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:19,680
Never heard of Runciter.

4082
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:21,600
No time for charades.

4083
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,820
Sound like this, sound like that, look like this.

4084
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:28,320
Why is it weird to like old movies?

4085
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:28,980
Right?

4086
02:48:28,980 --> 02:48:30,100
Sorry to bother you.

4087
02:48:32,840 --> 02:48:34,360
Okay, interesting.

4088
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:49,100
Wait, oh, wait.

4089
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:50,180
That's...

4090
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:52,000
Hey, you killed anyone yet?

4091
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:54,040
Why are you here?

4092
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:57,980
This is... there's a dead man right here.

4093
02:48:58,640 --> 02:48:59,600
Oh, he's gone.

4094
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:00,780
Just kidding.

4095
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:04,700
Wait, so there's... there's... the twins still aren't up here?

4096
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:06,740
I guess because they got fired?

4097
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:09,020
Why is Gap here?

4098
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:13,260
I'm telling you, he's suspicious to me.

4099
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,980
Did I kill anybody yet?

4100
02:49:23,700 --> 02:49:24,080
That

4101
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:29,740
guy at the very beginning of the game.

4102
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:36,100
And now he's gone.

4103
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:37,580
Okay.

4104
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:40,880
Let's see.

4105
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:45,560
Now do I go to Runciter's?

4106
02:49:50,090 --> 02:49:51,830
I'll try again, I guess.

4107
02:49:52,330 --> 02:49:52,450
Hmm.

4108
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:58,930
I thought Gap was like a symbol that was just like, okay, now...

4109
02:49:58,930 --> 02:50:00,870
If I'm here, that means he goes to sleep.

4110
02:50:03,070 --> 02:50:05,790
I'm not on a pacifist run, I'm trying to kill.

4111
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:12,890
Did you get the voice message about the twins?

4112
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,990
I should've, yeah.

4113
02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:20,090
No way.

4114
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:21,470
No way.

4115
02:50:21,470 --> 02:50:23,230
All my clues reset.

4116
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:25,110
Oh no, just kidding.

4117
02:50:25,310 --> 02:50:25,410
Okay.

4118
02:50:26,210 --> 02:50:27,290
That's just how they look.

4119
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:27,690
Okay.

4120
02:50:29,490 --> 02:50:30,110
Um...

4121
02:50:30,110 --> 02:50:32,170
He talked about the twins.

4122
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:34,310
Lance and Luther.

4123
02:50:48,330 --> 02:50:50,270
I don't see anything about it though.

4124
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:52,750
So maybe I didn't.

4125
02:50:55,810 --> 02:50:57,410
What was the audio recording?

4126
02:50:57,770 --> 02:50:58,070
Wait.

4127
02:51:02,390 --> 02:51:03,930
I don't see anything about twins.

4128
02:51:04,110 --> 02:51:05,950
I don't see anything about Lancer and Luther.

4129
02:51:08,570 --> 02:51:09,410
Suspects list?

4130
02:51:09,670 --> 02:51:09,810
Yeah.

4131
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:16,150
Uh...

4132
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:16,980
Lucy.

4133
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:17,980
Diesel.

4134
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:19,720
That guy.

4135
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:28,880
Someone responsible for animal murder and Moragia murder.

4136
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:31,340
Just the animal murder.

4137
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:33,220
This guy is the limping guy.

4138
02:51:37,690 --> 02:51:39,050
Zubin runs away.

4139
02:51:39,650 --> 02:51:40,270
Who's that?

4140
02:51:41,450 --> 02:51:41,570
Oh!

4141
02:51:42,230 --> 02:51:45,010
Zubin was the chef, I remember.

4142
02:51:49,390 --> 02:51:50,150
Hmm...

4143
02:51:50,150 --> 02:51:51,350
Central or Tyrell?

4144
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:52,470
Yeah, we can try.

4145
02:51:53,970 --> 02:51:58,110
How did my dad figure this game out?

4146
02:52:01,230 --> 02:52:01,870
How?

4147
02:52:02,770 --> 02:52:05,670
I guess it's just a lot of...

4148
02:52:06,590 --> 02:52:09,490
Trial and going around and seeing what you need to do.

4149
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:15,680
Look at him go.

4150
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:18,000
In his little car.

4151
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:28,620
I don't think...

4152
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:32,060
I may have more questions for you later on.

4153
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:33,080
Yes, sir.

4154
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:34,820
No, nothing here.

4155
02:52:41,930 --> 02:52:42,370
PlayStation.

4156
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:47,310
Yeah, I'm super eepy sleepy today.

4157
02:52:48,510 --> 02:52:50,810
It's okay, I can play a little bit more and then...

4158
02:52:50,810 --> 02:52:52,370
Maybe we'll finish it up tomorrow.

4159
02:52:57,870 --> 02:52:58,750
Ground floor.

4160
02:52:59,190 --> 02:52:59,850
Lock up.

4161
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:01,170
Oh wait, lock up!

4162
02:53:01,250 --> 02:53:02,010
We were gonna go to!

4163
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:04,710
Chu is voiced by James Hong.

4164
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:05,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4165
02:53:08,070 --> 02:53:10,350
Including the duck of Kung Fu Panda.

4166
02:53:10,850 --> 02:53:12,250
Also a military veteran.

4167
02:53:12,750 --> 02:53:14,610
Apparently he's 96 years old, wow.

4168
02:53:15,390 --> 02:53:16,270
Shido Neku-nya!

4169
02:53:16,610 --> 02:53:18,030
Thank you so much for the rito break!

4170
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:18,690
Thank you!

4171
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:20,610
You look right at home in there, Izo.

4172
02:53:21,150 --> 02:53:23,910
I've been in much tighter spots than this, McCoy.

4173
02:53:24,430 --> 02:53:25,110
I'll bet.

4174
02:53:25,310 --> 02:53:26,590
But this is only the beginning.

4175
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:27,250
Izo!

4176
02:53:29,110 --> 02:53:29,630
Is this?

4177
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:30,130
What's his name?

4178
02:53:30,410 --> 02:53:31,350
Are they letting me out?

4179
02:53:31,630 --> 02:53:32,490
Oh no, it's Gregorian.

4180
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,570
I'm not the one who makes that decision.

4181
02:53:34,010 --> 02:53:36,890
I suppose it's my turn to bear the cross for the cause.

4182
02:53:39,630 --> 02:53:40,810
You're're Spencer Gregorian, right?

4183
02:53:42,810 --> 02:53:43,410
Hey Kaskey, kid.

4184
02:53:43,590 --> 02:53:44,390
Thank you so much for the gifted.

4185
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:48,210
Thank you so much for the gifted.

4186
02:53:48,710 --> 02:54:06,850
Spank, thank you so much for the gifted!

4187
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:08,810
He says, where is your motivation?

4188
02:54:16,670 --> 02:54:18,110
He's right there.

4189
02:54:20,710 --> 02:54:22,730
He's within your shot.

4190
02:54:28,730 --> 02:54:30,250
He's next to you!

4191
02:54:33,630 --> 02:54:35,150
You mean your neighbor?

4192
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:37,870
Weapons to some of them.

4193
02:54:38,450 --> 02:54:39,510
What kind of weapons?

4194
02:54:40,050 --> 02:54:42,870
Guns so new that even the police had hardly used them, I heard.

4195
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:43,690
That's so funny.

4196
02:54:44,750 --> 02:54:46,150
Hey, I'm right here!

4197
02:54:46,790 --> 02:54:48,790
Quit talking about me like I'm dead!

4198
02:54:49,110 --> 02:54:50,290
Ready to supply me some answers?

4199
02:54:50,790 --> 02:54:52,510
I wish I had something to say.

4200
02:54:52,870 --> 02:54:54,790
I know your hands are dirty, Izo.

4201
02:54:55,210 --> 02:54:55,450
Yeah!

4202
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:57,790
Everybody in this world is trying to better himself.

4203
02:54:58,010 --> 02:54:59,450
No matter what the terms are.

4204
02:54:59,770 --> 02:55:01,790
If that counts as dirty, so be it.

4205
02:55:02,230 --> 02:55:04,430
The terms of your conviction won't be too clean.

4206
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:07,690
I'll be through with this place long before you, McCoy.

4207
02:55:08,650 --> 02:55:12,350
Yeah, I'm sure you've been saving up for a rainy day selling all those illegal weapons.

4208
02:55:12,910 --> 02:55:15,070
One never knows when fate will conspire.

4209
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:16,550
You must be prepared.

4210
02:55:17,130 --> 02:55:19,030
You're a real trooper, Izo.

4211
02:55:19,330 --> 02:55:22,150
Yeah, I love he's still got his little sword here.

4212
02:55:22,350 --> 02:55:23,150
On his back.

4213
02:55:23,490 --> 02:55:24,770
You look right at home in there, Izo.

4214
02:55:25,490 --> 02:55:26,530
That's really funny.

4215
02:55:27,630 --> 02:55:28,950
This guy had some other things.

4216
02:55:29,150 --> 02:55:29,550
Cars.

4217
02:55:29,850 --> 02:55:30,990
I got some more questions for you.

4218
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:34,250
Lot of people involved in your cause, Spencer.

4219
02:55:34,910 --> 02:55:36,450
With such an attitude.

4220
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:41,810
As more and more people realize that replicants have cognitive and emotional legitimacy.

4221
02:55:42,410 --> 02:55:46,650
The citizens against replicant slavery will spearhead the movement towards...

4222
02:55:46,650 --> 02:55:48,830
Save the pitch for someone who gives a shit.

4223
02:55:49,290 --> 02:55:51,210
We're peaceful people, detective.

4224
02:55:52,090 --> 02:55:55,550
We live by a code that men like you could never understand.

4225
02:55:56,050 --> 02:55:56,830
Try me.

4226
02:55:56,830 --> 02:56:00,490
Two centuries ago, humans were held in slavery.

4227
02:56:01,530 --> 02:56:04,070
Brave souls formed an underground railroad.

4228
02:56:04,530 --> 02:56:07,430
So, you help replicants escape the city.

4229
02:56:07,630 --> 02:56:10,010
I'm talking figuratively, detective.

4230
02:56:10,910 --> 02:56:11,730
Sure you are.

4231
02:56:12,150 --> 02:56:13,530
We're not children, detective.

4232
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:14,850
We have resources.

4233
02:56:15,410 --> 02:56:17,050
The world is changing.

4234
02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:22,190
People are waking up to the injustices perpetrated by a sick society that you have helped...

4235
02:56:22,190 --> 02:56:27,190
A lot of them will wake up dead if reps are allowed to run amok on Tara, jerk.

4236
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:28,350
Jerk.

4237
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:33,150
I see.

4238
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:39,470
V-V-Voy...Voy...Kampf.

4239
02:56:40,030 --> 02:56:41,510
I'm gonna give you a little test.

4240
02:56:41,890 --> 02:56:45,010
The other detective, she already tested me earlier today.

4241
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:47,170
Oh, we're just giv-we're all givin' out tests on.

4242
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:47,190
Uh-huh.

4243
02:56:47,190 --> 02:56:49,150
Look, I gotta check out the equipment, and you're the only stiff around.

4244
02:56:49,590 --> 02:56:51,090
I object to this treatment.

4245
02:56:51,090 --> 02:56:57,790
If you'll just call my lawyer, he'll take care- Your lawyer would tell you I got the authority to VK the mayor, if I want.

4246
02:56:57,890 --> 02:56:58,370
What does that mean?

4247
02:56:58,610 --> 02:57:02,410
And he'd have to smile and nod and kiss my butt until I cleared him.

4248
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:03,250
So sit down.

4249
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:04,630
He's gonna kiss her-oh!

4250
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:06,450
Administero!

4251
02:57:06,610 --> 02:57:08,530
Oh, I got the...the test!

4252
02:57:08,930 --> 02:57:10,350
What the hell is this?

4253
02:57:13,090 --> 02:57:14,240
Human reaction gauge.

4254
02:57:16,570 --> 02:57:17,830
Adjust the calibration.

4255
02:57:21,710 --> 02:57:23,770
I'm doing something and I don't know what I'm doing.

4256
02:57:26,910 --> 02:57:27,390
Uh...

4257
02:57:28,190 --> 02:57:29,530
Oh, I see, I see.

4258
02:57:33,090 --> 02:57:33,570
Uh...

4259
02:57:34,130 --> 02:57:36,390
Ask a medium intensity question.

4260
02:57:40,510 --> 02:57:41,470
Oh my...

4261
02:57:42,550 --> 02:57:44,330
What the hell is going on?

4262
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:56,760
Happy 10th anniversary of VK just getting in early.

4263
02:57:57,240 --> 02:57:58,120
Ha-ha-ha!

4264
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:00,380
Decorate, thank you!

4265
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:07,180
A-ha.

4266
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:14,020
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.

4267
02:58:14,320 --> 02:58:14,680
What?

4268
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:15,340
Where do you live?

4269
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:16,520
Third sector.

4270
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:17,160
Uptown.

4271
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:18,480
Nice neighborhood?

4272
02:58:19,180 --> 02:58:19,580
Very.

4273
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:21,400
Is this going to take long?

4274
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:23,860
Just keep your pants on, Spencer.

4275
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:26,480
I don't even know what's happening.

4276
02:58:31,730 --> 02:58:33,390
German fur without suffering.

4277
02:58:33,610 --> 02:58:35,550
It's a test to elicit an emotional response.

4278
02:58:36,190 --> 02:58:37,570
Replicates can be caught through this.

4279
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:38,010
Oh!

4280
02:58:38,770 --> 02:58:41,130
It was invented by the Soviets according to the novel.

4281
02:58:41,130 --> 02:58:41,610
Whoa!

4282
02:58:45,510 --> 02:58:46,370
I don't...

4283
02:58:46,370 --> 02:58:49,150
I wish I knew anything that was happening.

4284
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:50,990
You've been drafted into the army.

4285
02:58:51,370 --> 02:58:55,790
During a boot camp hazing, you're bound, blindfolded, and forced to eat worms.

4286
02:58:56,150 --> 02:58:56,510
Worms!

4287
02:58:56,510 --> 02:58:57,390
Hazing's illegal.

4288
02:58:57,890 --> 02:58:58,730
Oh, yeah.

4289
02:58:59,010 --> 02:59:00,690
You're really worried about breaking the law.

4290
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:03,170
Wonder why I'm the one on this side of the bars.

4291
02:59:03,870 --> 02:59:06,410
Civil disobedience has a long history in our world.

4292
02:59:06,730 --> 02:59:09,630
So does genocide, but I ain't out butchering my neighbors.

4293
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:16,570
I think this guy is human, though, but, like, I'm also very confused just what is happening.

4294
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:17,930
You're at a restaurant with friends.

4295
02:59:18,490 --> 02:59:19,950
One of them orders lobster.

4296
02:59:20,270 --> 02:59:24,910
The chef drops the lobster into the tub of boiling water while you watch.

4297
02:59:24,970 --> 02:59:25,190
No!

4298
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:26,950
Are you trying to make me sick?

4299
02:59:29,870 --> 02:59:34,710
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a large black spider crawling up the wall.

4300
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,950
I'd call animal services, of course.

4301
02:59:37,550 --> 02:59:40,450
I wouldn't try to move it myself, not without proper equipment.

4302
02:59:41,650 --> 02:59:43,290
I'm sorry.

4303
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:47,770
You're calling animal services for a spider?

4304
02:59:50,270 --> 02:59:50,750
Huh?

4305
02:59:54,230 --> 02:59:55,090
You know what?

4306
02:59:55,290 --> 02:59:55,910
Valid.

4307
02:59:56,270 --> 02:59:57,110
Like my briefcase?

4308
02:59:57,750 --> 02:59:58,490
Department issue.

4309
02:59:59,050 --> 02:59:59,750
Baby hide.

4310
02:59:59,750 --> 03:00:03,290
100% genuine human baby hide.

4311
03:00:03,890 --> 03:00:04,690
Appropriate.

4312
03:00:05,070 --> 03:00:05,990
For a killer.

4313
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:14,230
I don't know if we should be mentioning that.

4314
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:33,300
Is that something we should be mentioning to anybody?

4315
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:35,880
Is it from the babies I shot?

4316
03:00:35,880 --> 03:00:36,120
What?

4317
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:40,760
He's trying to get a reaction from Moses.

4318
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:43,560
It's quite the question, no?

4319
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:45,780
Ground floor.

4320
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:49,460
That's why me and Toa were shooting babies earlier.

4321
03:00:50,220 --> 03:00:51,600
For my briefcase.

4322
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:55,620
We got a whole bunch of new recruits, guys.

4323
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,400
We gotta...

4324
03:00:57,260 --> 03:00:58,780
We gotta get them...

4325
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:00,320
ready.

4326
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:00,620
Yeah.

4327
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:10,240
Um...

4328
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:12,180
I'm going to consult the...

4329
03:01:12,180 --> 03:01:13,040
the...

4330
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:13,880
the walkthrough.

4331
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:27,400
Go through the alley next to the eye lab.

4332
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:28,680
Oh wait!

4333
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:29,600
There's our guy!

4334
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:31,180
Go home and get some rest.

4335
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:33,160
I'm sure you need it.

4336
03:01:33,220 --> 03:01:34,280
Gaff is everywhere.

4337
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:38,300
A happier note...

4338
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:39,540
than baby hide.

4339
03:01:39,860 --> 03:01:41,440
Today is national ice cream day!

4340
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:43,100
I want ice cream!

4341
03:01:44,320 --> 03:01:45,560
I want ice cream.

4342
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:48,380
Okay.

4343
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:51,000
So...

4344
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:51,460
Roof.

4345
03:01:52,880 --> 03:01:53,980
We go...

4346
03:01:53,980 --> 03:01:54,580
There was a...

4347
03:01:54,580 --> 03:01:55,360
there was a la...

4348
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:57,240
an alleyway by the...

4349
03:01:58,060 --> 03:01:59,280
by the eye lab?

4350
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:00,560
In DNA Row?

4351
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:00,640
Oh?

4352
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:05,860
I guess I missed it.

4353
03:02:10,070 --> 03:02:11,470
Mochira on daisuki...

4354
03:02:12,010 --> 03:02:12,870
Ai sukurin!

4355
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:26,020
Alley, wait...

4356
03:02:26,020 --> 03:02:26,280
Is it...

4357
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,520
I'm guessing this is the eye lab.

4358
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:32,930
Here?

4359
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:59,130
Go through the alley next to the eye lab.

4360
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:00,850
Look out!

4361
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:01,970
Oh!

4362
03:03:02,090 --> 03:03:02,390
Here!

4363
03:03:02,650 --> 03:03:02,850
Maybe!

4364
03:03:02,850 --> 03:03:04,850
Oh my god...

4365
03:03:05,490 --> 03:03:05,850
Oh no.

4366
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,430
Just kidding.

4367
03:03:09,150 --> 03:03:10,110
Me too!

4368
03:03:10,610 --> 03:03:11,370
That's me!

4369
03:03:15,940 --> 03:03:21,320
Called Blade Brother so far, we've only seen one guy with a sword and he walked away with it.

4370
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,260
There was an alley...

4371
03:03:27,700 --> 03:03:28,840
somewhere, apparently.

4372
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:40,740
I am being told there's an alleyway in the walkthrough.

4373
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:50,980
I fear I'm being lied to.

4374
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:55,640
What?

4375
03:03:56,020 --> 03:03:56,860
What'd you do, huh?

4376
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:59,180
What did I do?

4377
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,080
Sorry to bother you.

4378
03:04:09,220 --> 03:04:13,440
Go into a mini cafe, your own little rice is inside out, and the latte art reads poison.

4379
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:14,700
What do you do?

4380
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:20,500
They won't let me go over here.

4381
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:21,900
If there's an...

4382
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:22,200
What?

4383
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:31,120
It says there's something here that we're supposed to enter.

4384
03:04:34,850 --> 03:04:37,930
To get us to Act 3, but I can't figure it out.

4385
03:04:56,500 --> 03:04:58,160
This game is a little obtuse.

4386
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:58,920
Sorry guys.

4387
03:05:00,480 --> 03:05:02,920
It says you should go after...

4388
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:13,640
After...

4389
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:14,760
Um...

4390
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:15,560
The bomb.

4391
03:05:18,500 --> 03:05:20,400
Point and click is always like that.

4392
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,660
Adventure games are like that?

4393
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:24,860
Yeah, they can be.

4394
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:32,880
Uh...

4395
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:35,500
It does say something about a Kia.

4396
03:05:36,220 --> 03:05:37,420
Like doing the Kia again.

4397
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:38,300
So let's do that.

4398
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:40,340
Oh my gosh!

4399
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,100
Guzz...

4400
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:42,880
Guzz...

4401
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:42,960
Guzz...

4402
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,140
Guzz...

4403
03:05:43,140 --> 03:05:44,240
He's here again!

4404
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:45,580
Let's go back.

4405
03:05:46,340 --> 03:05:46,600
Uh...

4406
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:47,360
Which would be faster?

4407
03:05:47,620 --> 03:05:48,460
The apartment maybe?

4408
03:05:50,700 --> 03:05:51,640
Let's try.

4409
03:05:54,780 --> 03:05:57,240
I'm looking out for any ambushers.

4410
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:01,600
So far we've only killed one guy.

4411
03:06:06,240 --> 03:06:08,300
I always keep the guide handy.

4412
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:10,280
I try not to.

4413
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,760
Your floor number please.

4414
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:13,820
But...

4415
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:16,320
McCoy, 88F.

4416
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:17,220
88.

4417
03:06:17,660 --> 03:06:18,400
Thank you.

4418
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:20,420
The new has me worried about Ray.

4419
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:21,660
What?

4420
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:24,840
Is it killing lately?

4421
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:26,020
Maggie!

4422
03:06:28,180 --> 03:06:28,800
Okay.

4423
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:31,080
So we had a new photo I believe.

4424
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:33,740
Which is what it wants us to investigate.

4425
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:34,280
This one.

4426
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:34,760
I think.

4427
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:35,620
China bar.

4428
03:06:35,960 --> 03:06:36,260
Yes!

4429
03:06:36,760 --> 03:06:38,400
So maybe this will...

4430
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:41,600
Activate something.

4431
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:48,920
Tooth game played by a cute maid.

4432
03:06:48,920 --> 03:06:49,480
Ah!

4433
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:51,380
Whoa!

4434
03:06:51,880 --> 03:06:52,920
Is that Izo?

4435
03:06:53,960 --> 03:06:54,460
Oof!

4436
03:06:55,020 --> 03:06:56,380
That guy sure gets around.

4437
03:06:56,680 --> 03:06:57,740
Give me a hard copy of that.

4438
03:06:58,140 --> 03:06:59,040
Wait, who is that guy?

4439
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:03,140
What about the lady?

4440
03:07:04,160 --> 03:07:05,840
What about our little lady friend?

4441
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:09,000
Enhance.

4442
03:07:13,720 --> 03:07:14,220
Enhance?

4443
03:07:14,700 --> 03:07:16,600
Hold on, sorry, I'm reading the guide again.

4444
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:17,180
Haha!

4445
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:26,960
Zoom on the head of the guy talking to the woman at the blonde bar.

4446
03:07:27,080 --> 03:07:27,400
Oh, okay.

4447
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:27,940
Nevermind.

4448
03:07:29,440 --> 03:07:31,540
I wonder if there's anything in the picture of us.

4449
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:34,100
Wait, how do I get back to that?

4450
03:07:37,310 --> 03:07:38,070
Oh, here we go.

4451
03:07:38,690 --> 03:07:38,950
This one.

4452
03:07:40,010 --> 03:07:40,410
Yeah!

4453
03:07:42,410 --> 03:07:43,290
Yeah!

4454
03:07:50,390 --> 03:07:54,090
Computer enhance on the lady in the bottom... bottom left?

4455
03:07:55,610 --> 03:07:56,850
Peach posting?

4456
03:07:57,530 --> 03:07:58,410
Peach?

4457
03:08:00,230 --> 03:08:01,490
No comment?

4458
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:08,040
Enhance!

4459
03:08:08,280 --> 03:08:09,120
Oh gosh!

4460
03:08:11,280 --> 03:08:12,160
Enhance!

4461
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:16,860
The other left.

4462
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:19,460
What a face.

4463
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:21,420
Face only Maggie could love.

4464
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:25,680
Okay, well we got this thing.

4465
03:08:26,200 --> 03:08:28,240
I don't think there was anything else in the china bar.

4466
03:08:36,570 --> 03:08:37,760
I don't think so.

4467
03:08:38,820 --> 03:08:40,400
Except a pretty lady.

4468
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:42,800
Who's this handsome devil?

4469
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:44,240
Ha ha ha ha.

4470
03:08:45,660 --> 03:08:46,720
McCoy, are you?

4471
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:47,400
Is that you?

4472
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,580
Your floor number, please.

4473
03:08:51,880 --> 03:08:53,760
Maybe that will activate where we need to go.

4474
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:54,380
Oof.

4475
03:08:55,060 --> 03:08:55,460
Oof.

4476
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:58,600
Maybe.

4477
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:00,560
Maybe.

4478
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:02,180
Ha!

4479
03:09:13,360 --> 03:09:14,000
Alright.

4480
03:09:18,540 --> 03:09:20,340
Where was that bar, anyway?

4481
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:23,580
It just said China bar.

4482
03:09:25,220 --> 03:09:29,240
I'm gonna go back to DNA row, because that's what the walkthrough tells me to do?

4483
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:34,540
But for some reason, I think that it's not going to change much.

4484
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:37,220
I might... hopefully I'm wrong.

4485
03:09:42,390 --> 03:09:42,930
Ah!

4486
03:09:43,230 --> 03:09:44,630
Where is the alleyway?

4487
03:09:45,050 --> 03:09:46,710
That we need to go to?

4488
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:46,870
Thank you.

4489
03:09:49,030 --> 03:09:50,750
This is the i...

4490
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:51,750
lab.

4491
03:09:51,930 --> 03:09:52,090
No!

4492
03:09:55,890 --> 03:09:58,030
Upstairs, twins, phone answering machine.

4493
03:09:58,270 --> 03:09:58,450
Okay.

4494
03:10:00,090 --> 03:10:01,250
Oh my god!

4495
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:03,510
Get out of here, you freak!

4496
03:10:05,090 --> 03:10:06,870
Why are you stalking me?

4497
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:10,030
Did I not get the phone?

4498
03:10:11,190 --> 03:10:12,190
Or the...

4499
03:10:12,190 --> 03:10:14,010
I thought there was something on the computer I got.

4500
03:10:14,430 --> 03:10:15,410
I'll check again though.

4501
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:18,730
Gaff is everywhere.

4502
03:10:19,790 --> 03:10:21,110
Let me do my job.

4503
03:10:21,310 --> 03:10:23,130
You can't be hovering over me like this forever.

4504
03:10:23,570 --> 03:10:23,810
Hmm.

4505
03:10:26,250 --> 03:10:27,270
Oh, maybe it's this!

4506
03:10:27,870 --> 03:10:28,450
Hello, Luther.

4507
03:10:28,830 --> 03:10:29,710
Hello, Lance.

4508
03:10:30,110 --> 03:10:33,870
You have no new messages and one saved voice-only message.

4509
03:10:34,170 --> 03:10:36,550
Would you like to hear the saved message again?

4510
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:37,750
Absolutely.

4511
03:10:38,590 --> 03:10:40,070
Hello, it's JF Sebastian.

4512
03:10:40,410 --> 03:10:42,010
I hope you guys are alright.

4513
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:42,670
Sebastian.

4514
03:10:42,670 --> 03:10:46,730
I tried to talk to Dr. Terrell about, uh, about your reinstatement.

4515
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:48,810
Re-employment.

4516
03:10:49,150 --> 03:10:49,510
Yeah.

4517
03:10:50,250 --> 03:10:53,170
But I haven't been able to get through to him yet.

4518
03:10:53,570 --> 03:10:57,570
He's kinda angry and you know what a cool customer he is.

4519
03:10:58,630 --> 03:11:01,930
I don't know what happened between you guys, but I'm still trying.

4520
03:11:02,470 --> 03:11:03,970
There is a doll maker in this.

4521
03:11:03,970 --> 03:11:05,810
If you want to get together, I'm still at the Bradbury.

4522
03:11:06,390 --> 03:11:07,230
I'll be here all night.

4523
03:11:07,270 --> 03:11:08,050
That's at the Bradbury!

To delete, please state your deletion security number.

4526
03:11:13,970 --> 03:11:14,790
Not right now.

4527
03:11:14,790 --> 03:11:16,470
8-0-0-8-5.

4528
03:11:16,610 --> 03:11:18,650
The pleasure is all ours at Sino Bell.

4529
03:11:19,790 --> 03:11:20,170
Okay.

4530
03:11:20,570 --> 03:11:21,130
Nice!

4531
03:11:21,350 --> 03:11:25,070
Alright, let's go meet our guy at the Bradbury.

4532
03:11:37,050 --> 03:11:39,190
He always walks so slowly there.

4533
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:39,410
Okay.

4534
03:11:41,190 --> 03:11:41,790
Yay!

4535
03:11:42,230 --> 03:11:43,510
That should activate it.

4536
03:11:43,590 --> 03:11:47,410
Thank you for, um, whoever told me about the...

4537
03:11:48,270 --> 03:11:49,670
Oh, but it doesn't.

4538
03:11:50,610 --> 03:11:50,870
Eh?

4539
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:53,230
Maybe the Bradbury is in our car.

4540
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:55,950
Maybe the Bradbury is the friends we made along the...

4541
03:11:55,950 --> 03:11:56,230
Ah!

4542
03:11:56,510 --> 03:11:57,710
He scared me again!

4543
03:11:59,650 --> 03:12:00,210
Bradbury!

4544
03:12:03,660 --> 03:12:05,820
This is so tiny, by the way.

4545
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:06,800
The DNA roll.

4546
03:12:10,850 --> 03:12:13,350
Maybe let's go talk to somebody.

4547
03:12:16,130 --> 03:12:16,690
Oh!

4548
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:17,090
Wait!

4549
03:12:17,370 --> 03:12:17,510
Wait!

4550
03:12:17,790 --> 03:12:17,870
Wait!

4551
03:12:18,230 --> 03:12:19,630
You still hanging around?

4552
03:12:20,510 --> 03:12:21,490
Who is that?

4553
03:12:27,030 --> 03:12:27,430
What?

4554
03:12:27,430 --> 03:12:28,210
Wait, who was that?

4555
03:12:31,430 --> 03:12:33,010
Ray, go into the Brad...

4556
03:12:33,010 --> 03:12:33,930
Hey, pal.

4557
03:12:37,150 --> 03:12:38,210
What's shaking, baby?

4558
03:12:38,430 --> 03:12:38,950
Oh, it's Gordo!

4559
03:12:39,390 --> 03:12:41,190
Haven't I seen you around these parts before?

4560
03:12:42,170 --> 03:12:42,790
Could be.

4561
03:12:42,930 --> 03:12:43,570
I get around.

4562
03:12:44,010 --> 03:12:44,950
He was the guy at the bar.

4563
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:45,970
You ever get down to Nightclub Row?

4564
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,550
You ought to check out my act.

4565
03:12:48,030 --> 03:12:48,710
Nightclub Row?

4566
03:12:48,710 --> 03:12:49,070
I'm just...

4567
03:12:49,070 --> 03:12:50,170
Warming up the room.

4568
03:12:50,470 --> 03:12:52,570
But it's better than a kick in the pants, ya dig?

4569
03:12:52,570 --> 03:12:53,590
What?

4570
03:12:54,010 --> 03:12:54,790
What kind of stuff do you do?

4571
03:12:55,510 --> 03:12:56,530
What kind of...

4572
03:12:56,530 --> 03:12:57,470
You kidding, baby?

4573
03:12:57,690 --> 03:12:58,690
I do it all!

4574
03:12:58,890 --> 03:12:59,470
It does it all!

4575
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:04,690
I am the direct extension of Frankie, Sammy D, and Dino Martini.

4576
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:05,210
Wow.

4577
03:13:05,770 --> 03:13:05,970
Who?

4578
03:13:06,490 --> 03:13:09,470
Man, you really must be dozing in Squaresville.

4579
03:13:09,470 --> 03:13:14,090
So, if you're asking who the voice is, you know, old Blue Eyes.

4580
03:13:14,750 --> 03:13:16,070
The chairman of the board?

4581
03:13:16,330 --> 03:13:16,670
Yeah.

4582
03:13:17,470 --> 03:13:18,450
Sinatra, man.

4583
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:18,950
Frankie!

4584
03:13:19,670 --> 03:13:21,230
The guy's been dead for 20 years.

4585
03:13:21,790 --> 03:13:26,250
Well, you're gonna remember the name Gordo Frizz, just like old Blue Eyes.

4586
03:13:26,370 --> 03:13:27,290
Gordo Frizz.

4587
03:13:27,450 --> 03:13:29,390
I ain't on the Marquis of Earlies just yet.

4588
03:13:29,650 --> 03:13:30,530
But it's coming.

4589
03:13:30,730 --> 03:13:31,730
I promise ya.

4590
03:13:32,910 --> 03:13:34,170
20, that's it?

4591
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:34,870
I know, right?

4592
03:13:35,670 --> 03:13:38,130
You know anything about that bomb that just rocked the street?

4593
03:13:38,710 --> 03:13:39,190
Bombing?

4594
03:13:39,710 --> 03:13:41,290
I've never bombed in my life.

4595
03:13:41,590 --> 03:13:42,970
My act is always happening.

4596
03:13:43,130 --> 03:13:43,770
Always now.

4597
03:13:44,770 --> 03:13:45,690
Cut to shit.

4598
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:47,190
The man was killed back there.

4599
03:13:47,810 --> 03:13:48,630
Gee, that's a drag.

4600
03:13:49,290 --> 03:13:51,830
There's eight million stories in the Naked City, you know?

4601
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:53,010
Gordo!

4602
03:13:53,110 --> 03:13:54,210
And you know nothing about it.

4603
03:13:54,850 --> 03:13:55,590
Sali, Charlie.

4604
03:13:58,130 --> 03:13:59,030
Sali, Charlie.

4605
03:14:01,230 --> 03:14:03,250
Hey, Gordo, how do I get to the...

4606
03:14:04,050 --> 03:14:05,290
How do I get to the...

4607
03:14:05,290 --> 03:14:06,170
The hotel?

4608
03:14:06,730 --> 03:14:07,590
It's telling me to go...

4609
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:07,910
Not good time now.

4610
03:14:07,970 --> 03:14:08,510
Come back later.

4611
03:14:09,670 --> 03:14:10,510
Can you...

4612
03:14:10,510 --> 03:14:11,690
Can you help me get to...

4613
03:14:12,250 --> 03:14:13,090
I'm lost!

4614
03:14:13,490 --> 03:14:14,210
Please, sir.

4615
03:14:14,310 --> 03:14:15,290
I need...

4616
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:16,130
Directions.

4617
03:14:20,850 --> 03:14:21,930
It's still mumbling.

4618
03:14:22,770 --> 03:14:23,490
In Chinese.

4619
03:14:24,210 --> 03:14:25,530
What's Sebastian been up to lately?

4620
03:14:25,730 --> 03:14:26,090
Oh, okay.

4621
03:14:26,130 --> 03:14:26,370
Here we go.

4622
03:14:26,490 --> 03:14:26,850
Sebastian?

4623
03:14:27,510 --> 03:14:28,770
You do what always do.

4624
03:14:28,890 --> 03:14:29,490
Nervous system.

4625
03:14:29,970 --> 03:14:31,510
Very important to Dr. Terrell.

4626
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:32,870
Where do I find him?

4627
03:14:33,450 --> 03:14:34,930
He had an old building down the alley.

4628
03:14:35,290 --> 03:14:35,970
Oh, here we go.

4629
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:37,730
Bradbury Hotel, I think.

4630
03:14:38,170 --> 03:14:40,190
You walk down the alley, you find it.

4631
03:14:40,310 --> 03:14:40,510
Yeah!

4632
03:14:41,750 --> 03:14:43,010
Guy's my new roll bottle.

4633
03:14:44,150 --> 03:14:45,110
Sorry to bother you.

4634
03:14:45,890 --> 03:14:46,330
I...

4635
03:14:46,330 --> 03:14:47,370
I can't get over that.

4636
03:14:47,630 --> 03:14:48,890
You know anything about the bomb?

4637
03:14:49,210 --> 03:14:49,590
Bomb?

4638
03:14:49,750 --> 03:14:50,610
I never bomb.

4639
03:14:52,890 --> 03:14:53,330
Yay!

4640
03:14:53,430 --> 03:14:54,430
Oh my gosh.

4641
03:14:54,570 --> 03:14:55,330
We did it.

4642
03:14:55,730 --> 03:14:56,130
Yay!

4643
03:14:58,510 --> 03:14:59,790
Is this it?

4644
03:15:00,190 --> 03:15:01,410
The Bradbury?

4645
03:15:01,930 --> 03:15:02,730
Creepy.

4646
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:09,340
Here we go.

4647
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:11,980
Progress!

4648
03:15:12,320 --> 03:15:12,940
Oh my gosh!

4649
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:16,040
Is this...

4650
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:17,880
This place is still...

4651
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:18,900
Functional, no?

4652
03:15:20,740 --> 03:15:24,020
This is a place where people still...

4653
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:24,760
reside?

4654
03:15:26,500 --> 03:15:26,880
Oh,

4655
03:15:39,060 --> 03:15:39,760
I remember this thing!

4656
03:15:39,900 --> 03:15:41,320
It was some kind of freakish toy.

4657
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:41,840
Oh!

4658
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:43,220
Half mechanical, half organic.

4659
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:44,860
Ref technology for sure.

4660
03:15:45,020 --> 03:15:45,460
Oh my gosh.

4661
03:15:45,480 --> 03:15:47,620
But no one was gonna give me any retirement bonus for it.

4662
03:15:47,660 --> 03:15:48,760
I did not like this guy.

4663
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:49,910
Oh my gosh!

4664
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:51,220
Oh!

4665
03:15:52,820 --> 03:15:54,400
I remember this thing.

4666
03:15:54,820 --> 03:15:55,940
Oh my gosh!

4667
03:15:56,120 --> 03:15:57,400
I hate...

4668
03:15:57,400 --> 03:15:58,520
Hate, hate, hate.

4669
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:00,080
Oh my gosh.

4670
03:16:00,500 --> 03:16:00,980
It's...

4671
03:16:00,980 --> 03:16:01,100
Where?

4672
03:16:02,420 --> 03:16:02,900
Uh...

4673
03:16:03,980 --> 03:16:04,460
Uh...

4674
03:16:04,460 --> 03:16:05,360
Uh...

4675
03:16:05,360 --> 03:16:05,520
Uh...

4676
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:05,620
Uh...

4677
03:16:05,620 --> 03:16:06,020
Uh...

4678
03:16:06,020 --> 03:16:06,180
Uh...

4679
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:06,940
So freaky.

4680
03:16:08,140 --> 03:16:08,440
Ah!

4681
03:16:08,600 --> 03:16:08,920
Sorry.

4682
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:10,420
Oh, I don't like him.

4683
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,420
Oh gosh.

4684
03:16:19,030 --> 03:16:20,390
Getting all the flashbacks.

4685
03:16:20,650 --> 03:16:22,650
I didn't have time to stop for synthetic eggs.

4686
03:16:22,790 --> 03:16:25,230
I remember tasting a real one back when I was a kid.

4687
03:16:25,430 --> 03:16:26,350
It was like liquid sunshine.

4688
03:16:26,350 --> 03:16:27,870
Damn tasty.

4689
03:16:28,630 --> 03:16:30,110
I love eggs.

4690
03:16:37,550 --> 03:16:38,350
Oh...

4691
03:16:38,350 --> 03:16:40,210
This place is kind of freaky, no?

4692
03:16:42,750 --> 03:16:44,610
More useless junk.

4693
03:16:46,470 --> 03:16:47,270
Right...

4694
03:16:47,270 --> 03:16:48,690
Useless junk.

4695
03:16:49,950 --> 03:16:51,330
Oh my god.

4696
03:16:51,830 --> 03:16:52,970
This is so freaky.

4697
03:16:53,130 --> 03:16:53,570
Oh, what's this?

4698
03:16:54,370 --> 03:16:56,610
Presuming interrupted print job.

4699
03:16:58,030 --> 03:16:58,250
Beep!

4700
03:16:59,150 --> 03:16:59,950
Beep!

4701
03:17:00,090 --> 03:17:00,130
Beep!

4702
03:17:00,270 --> 03:17:00,450
Beep!

4703
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:00,510
Beep!

4704
03:17:00,510 --> 03:17:00,570
Beep!

4705
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:00,590
Beep!

4706
03:17:00,870 --> 03:17:01,150
Beep!

4707
03:17:04,390 --> 03:17:05,810
Nothing more to find.

4708
03:17:06,010 --> 03:17:06,870
What did they print?

4709
03:17:08,950 --> 03:17:09,450
Maybe...

4710
03:17:10,730 --> 03:17:11,230
Uh...

4711
03:17:11,230 --> 03:17:12,330
This over here?

4712
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:15,130
DNA research.

4713
03:17:15,490 --> 03:17:16,350
Incept dates.

4714
03:17:16,530 --> 03:17:17,370
A lot of jargon.

4715
03:17:17,550 --> 03:17:19,870
But I bet my spinner it was valuable to somebody.

4716
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:21,290
Nice, nice, nice.

4717
03:17:21,610 --> 03:17:21,710
Okay.

4718
03:17:29,050 --> 03:17:30,950
It was some kind of freakish toy.

4719
03:17:31,270 --> 03:17:32,870
Half mechanical, half organic.

4720
03:17:33,070 --> 03:17:34,450
Rep technology for sure.

4721
03:17:34,690 --> 03:17:37,230
But no one was going to give me any retirement bonus for it.

4722
03:17:38,930 --> 03:17:39,690
Oh...

4723
03:17:39,690 --> 03:17:40,710
There's two of them.

4724
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:40,810
There's two of them!

4725
03:17:41,730 --> 03:17:43,010
Oh my god.

4726
03:17:43,990 --> 03:17:45,730
I forget I remember...

4727
03:17:45,730 --> 03:17:46,150
Oh.

4728
03:17:46,970 --> 03:17:48,130
I remember...

4729
03:17:48,130 --> 03:17:49,370
I remember hitting this place.

4730
03:17:49,750 --> 03:17:51,650
I remember all this water.

4731
03:17:51,990 --> 03:17:52,650
Oh my gosh.

4732
03:17:55,530 --> 03:17:56,290
Sorry.

4733
03:17:56,290 --> 03:17:56,590
Sorry.

4734
03:17:57,210 --> 03:17:58,850
Oh my gosh.

4735
03:17:59,430 --> 03:18:00,750
Oh my gosh.

4736
03:18:01,610 --> 03:18:02,970
Oh my gosh.

4737
03:18:12,790 --> 03:18:14,290
Let me save the game.

4738
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:30,440
I'm scared.

4739
03:18:32,980 --> 03:18:34,140
I'm scared.

4740
03:18:34,820 --> 03:18:35,660
What is that?

4741
03:18:37,860 --> 03:18:42,960
Is that something?

4742
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:43,200
No.

4743
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:47,260
We're just... Wow, we actually just vandalized the place.

4744
03:18:47,260 --> 03:18:49,560
It had nothing of value at all.

4745
03:18:50,460 --> 03:18:51,100
Okay.

4746
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:56,640
Anything?

4747
03:18:59,080 --> 03:18:59,720
No?

4748
03:19:00,520 --> 03:19:02,160
Oh wait, we can go up.

4749
03:19:02,580 --> 03:19:04,620
Oh, it made a ladder.

4750
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:06,100
Oh gosh.

4751
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:08,760
I'm

4752
03:19:13,590 --> 03:19:14,530
getting my ass beat.

4753
03:19:15,090 --> 03:19:15,390
Uh oh.

4754
03:19:15,710 --> 03:19:16,550
He's kicking me.

4755
03:19:16,550 --> 03:19:17,170
What do you do, Sadiq?

4756
03:19:20,190 --> 03:19:20,370
Enough.

4757
03:19:21,190 --> 03:19:21,970
Stop taking me.

4758
03:19:22,950 --> 03:19:25,670
One of the design subcons must have talked.

4759
03:19:26,330 --> 03:19:28,410
Unstable personalities, to say the least.

4760
03:19:28,670 --> 03:19:31,150
For you, we should have blown up the old block.

4761
03:19:31,810 --> 03:19:34,030
It would have created problems down the line.

4762
03:19:34,530 --> 03:19:35,910
We got problem Nauma.

4763
03:19:36,850 --> 03:19:37,470
This one?

4764
03:19:37,830 --> 03:19:39,090
He's not a problem.

4765
03:19:39,690 --> 03:19:41,790
He's an opportunity.

4766
03:19:41,790 --> 03:19:42,470
Ooh.

4767
03:19:43,350 --> 03:19:44,530
You're weak, my friend.

4768
03:19:45,290 --> 03:19:47,410
I expected so much more from you.

4769
03:19:47,410 --> 03:19:48,330
Are you gonna blow me up?

4770
03:19:48,470 --> 03:19:50,710
I'm thinking our brother not hearing too good.

4771
03:19:51,350 --> 03:19:52,950
Oh, he hears us.

4772
03:19:52,950 --> 03:19:54,030
Yeah, cause he kicked me in the ear.

4773
03:19:54,030 --> 03:19:56,110
Isn't that right, McCoy?

4774
03:19:56,770 --> 03:19:58,930
You ready to give up fruitless nightmare man?

4775
03:19:58,930 --> 03:19:59,270
You know my name.

4776
03:19:59,870 --> 03:20:00,890
Come back to family?

4777
03:20:01,470 --> 03:20:03,050
He doesn't have a choice.

4778
03:20:03,430 --> 03:20:03,530
Huh?

4779
03:20:03,850 --> 03:20:04,770
He never did.

4780
03:20:06,150 --> 03:20:06,710
Oh!

4781
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:09,960
Rich Act 3!

4782
03:20:10,440 --> 03:20:11,080
We did it!

4783
03:20:11,120 --> 03:20:12,060
Let me kill him, man.

4784
03:20:12,400 --> 03:20:12,620
No.

4785
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:14,940
We got no time to be patient.

4786
03:20:15,420 --> 03:20:17,460
Your woman, she be getting sick.

4787
03:20:17,960 --> 03:20:21,040
I promise you, she'll not die here on Earth.

4788
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:24,140
He looks like... I promise somebody will.

4789
03:20:24,140 --> 03:20:28,780
Like a 2000s... like emo band singer.

4790
03:20:29,260 --> 03:20:29,760
Something dangerous.

4791
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:32,620
A fool sees not the same tree a wise man sees.

4792
03:20:33,080 --> 03:20:34,280
I'm no fool, man.

4793
03:20:35,540 --> 03:20:37,080
You must have a little faith, my friend.

4794
03:20:38,020 --> 03:20:39,640
Without contraries is no progression.

4795
03:20:40,280 --> 03:20:42,520
How can you trust any of their kind?

4796
03:20:43,440 --> 03:20:44,000
We have been manipulated by them, correct?

4797
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:45,240
Or he looks like a backstreet.

4798
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:46,480
One of the backstreet boys.

4799
03:20:47,300 --> 03:20:50,600
Now they're going to see exactly what lies on the other side of the horizon.

4800
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:53,200
Whoa!

4801
03:20:56,900 --> 03:20:57,500
Worm!

4802
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:02,200
That's on the horizon?

4803
03:21:04,640 --> 03:21:06,040
Catch me if you can!

4804
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:07,160
What?

4805
03:21:10,750 --> 03:21:11,750
It's Lucy!

4806
03:21:13,230 --> 03:21:14,130
Atomic bomb!

4807
03:21:14,670 --> 03:21:15,430
What just happened?

4808
03:21:15,830 --> 03:21:16,310
Lucy!

4809
03:21:17,710 --> 03:21:19,030
How long have I been here, Lucy?

4810
03:21:19,730 --> 03:21:21,070
How do you know my name?

4811
03:21:21,070 --> 03:21:23,090
I saw your things at Runciter's.

4812
03:21:24,670 --> 03:21:26,730
Did you feel bad when they killed those animals?

4813
03:21:27,650 --> 03:21:29,470
They were so pretty and sweet.

4814
03:21:30,070 --> 03:21:31,910
I hoped father wouldn't do it.

4815
03:21:32,750 --> 03:21:35,150
But Mr. Runciter deserved retribution.

4816
03:21:35,450 --> 03:21:36,710
That's what father said.

4817
03:21:37,050 --> 03:21:38,310
Okay fair, but...

4818
03:21:38,530 --> 03:21:39,890
The animals were innocent.

4819
03:21:40,510 --> 03:21:42,390
He treated me...

4820
03:21:42,390 --> 03:21:42,450
Bad.

4821
03:21:43,050 --> 03:21:44,510
Like I belong to him.

4822
03:21:45,610 --> 03:21:46,370
I'm sorry.

4823
03:21:48,970 --> 03:21:50,730
Are you really the hunter?

4824
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:52,290
Like father says?

4825
03:21:52,850 --> 03:21:53,810
It's my job.

4826
03:21:54,090 --> 03:21:54,370
Why?

4827
03:21:55,010 --> 03:21:56,530
What do you have against us?

4828
03:21:57,030 --> 03:21:57,410
Nothing.

4829
03:21:57,570 --> 03:21:58,150
It's just...

4830
03:21:58,610 --> 03:21:59,190
The law.

4831
03:21:59,550 --> 03:22:00,710
Would you hurt me?

4832
03:22:02,210 --> 03:22:03,670
I promise you I won't.

4833
03:22:04,410 --> 03:22:05,590
But it's the law.

4834
03:22:05,850 --> 03:22:06,690
You just said.

4835
03:22:06,690 --> 03:22:06,710
What?

4836
03:22:08,530 --> 03:22:09,790
Father will be back soon.

4837
03:22:14,190 --> 03:22:14,990
Is that it?

4838
03:22:18,970 --> 03:22:22,290
There I feel like we did not explore that place so much.

4839
03:22:22,690 --> 03:22:25,110
I feel like there's some other things that I didn't look around.

4840
03:22:25,110 --> 03:22:25,730
You know?

4841
03:22:26,450 --> 03:22:27,130
Um.

4842
03:22:27,230 --> 03:22:27,650
But that's okay.

4843
03:22:29,110 --> 03:22:30,050
Let's see.

4844
03:22:30,550 --> 03:22:31,710
What do we got here?

4845
03:22:31,810 --> 03:22:33,370
Oh, there's a little doll.

4846
03:22:34,470 --> 03:22:34,730
Um.

4847
03:22:35,570 --> 03:22:35,970
Hold on.

4848
03:22:36,150 --> 03:22:37,070
One second.

4849
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:43,700
Oh.

4850
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:49,220
Trying to see.

4851
03:22:55,680 --> 03:22:56,360
Okay.

4852
03:22:56,900 --> 03:22:58,200
So we're...

4853
03:22:58,200 --> 03:22:59,960
So apparently there's five acts.

4854
03:22:59,960 --> 03:23:01,500
We're on act three.

4855
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:02,140
We're on act three.

4856
03:23:02,140 --> 03:23:03,040
So I think maybe...

4857
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:06,560
Tomorrow...

4858
03:23:08,480 --> 03:23:09,600
We can...

4859
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:11,260
Finish the rest.

4860
03:23:13,020 --> 03:23:14,140
That's what I'm thinking.

4861
03:23:17,380 --> 03:23:17,940
Yeah.

4862
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:20,960
I might cut it here just because I'm still feeling a little...

4863
03:23:22,220 --> 03:23:24,320
I'm still feeling a little bleh.

4864
03:23:25,540 --> 03:23:26,100
So...

4865
03:23:26,100 --> 03:23:26,420
Hmm.

4866
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:29,780
I think this is a good spot to end it probably.

4867
03:23:30,220 --> 03:23:30,440
Probably.

4868
03:23:33,720 --> 03:23:34,720
But uh...

4869
03:23:35,360 --> 03:23:36,620
I still have to make my...

4870
03:23:36,620 --> 03:23:37,380
Finish my schedule.

4871
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:38,360
For the week.

4872
03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:40,260
But...

4873
03:23:40,260 --> 03:23:42,160
Either tomorrow or the day after.

4874
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:42,740
I'll...

4875
03:23:42,740 --> 03:23:43,620
I'll figure it out.

4876
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:45,500
Because I have a meeting.

4877
03:23:46,380 --> 03:23:46,780
Um.

4878
03:23:47,300 --> 03:23:51,440
Here's a $50 bribe to consider the nice guys for next watch along.

4879
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:52,640
And that...

4880
03:23:52,640 --> 03:23:53,180
Wait isn't...

4881
03:23:53,180 --> 03:23:53,340
Wait.

4882
03:23:54,580 --> 03:23:55,700
I think I talked to...

4883
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:56,420
Oh yeah, yeah.

4884
03:23:56,540 --> 03:23:57,800
We talked about that...

4885
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:58,480
That video.

4886
03:23:58,640 --> 03:23:59,160
That movie.

4887
03:23:59,580 --> 03:23:59,900
Recently.

4888
03:24:00,100 --> 03:24:00,480
Thank you.

4889
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:02,160
Thank you for the pink.

4890
03:24:02,680 --> 03:24:03,920
Thank you so much, Drake.

4891
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:04,780
Um.

4892
03:24:05,020 --> 03:24:06,000
Thank you for your help today too.

4893
03:24:06,100 --> 03:24:09,480
Thank you guys for helping me out with some of the parts when I was getting stumped too.

4894
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:12,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4895
03:24:13,280 --> 03:24:13,920
So...

4896
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:14,100
Um.

4897
03:24:14,300 --> 03:24:15,960
We'll finish it this week though.

4898
03:24:16,180 --> 03:24:16,900
We'll finish...

4899
03:24:16,900 --> 03:24:17,480
Uh...

4900
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:20,320
Blade Runner.

4901
03:24:21,520 --> 03:24:22,600
Sometime this week.

4902
03:24:22,780 --> 03:24:23,800
Either tomorrow...

4903
03:24:23,800 --> 03:24:25,340
Or sometime else.

4904
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:26,640
Yeah.

4905
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:28,320
But um...

4906
03:24:28,320 --> 03:24:28,600
Yeah!

4907
03:24:29,300 --> 03:24:29,980
Thank you guys!

4908
03:24:30,320 --> 03:24:31,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4909
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:33,900
Um...

4910
03:24:34,480 --> 03:24:35,140
And...

4911
03:24:35,140 --> 03:24:37,980
We'll probably unlock so many core memories tonight.

4912
03:24:38,180 --> 03:24:38,760
I...

4913
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:39,340
I...

4914
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:39,880
I...

4915
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:40,760
I...

4916
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:41,820
Just seeing some of these things.

4917
03:24:41,840 --> 03:24:42,680
I would be like...

4918
03:24:42,680 --> 03:24:43,460
I...

4919
03:24:43,460 --> 03:24:44,600
I recognize this.

4920
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:45,600
And I recognize that.

4921
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:46,260
I recognize...

4922
03:24:46,260 --> 03:24:47,180
It was so crazy!

4923
03:24:47,180 --> 03:24:48,660
Going and seeing all these...

4924
03:24:48,660 --> 03:24:50,460
These places that I'm like...

4925
03:24:50,460 --> 03:24:51,180
Whoa, wait a second.

4926
03:24:51,180 --> 03:24:52,140
I actually...

4927
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:53,820
I know this for real!

4928
03:24:53,860 --> 03:24:55,160
It's crazy.

4929
03:24:56,200 --> 03:24:57,100
Crazy, crazy.

4930
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:01,520
And there were some parts where I was like...

4931
03:25:01,520 --> 03:25:03,600
I could very vividly remember it.

4932
03:25:03,740 --> 03:25:04,500
Like the...

4933
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:05,560
Like the pet store.

4934
03:25:05,800 --> 03:25:06,140
But...

4935
03:25:06,140 --> 03:25:07,700
Some parts that I was just like...

4936
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:08,000
Wait.

4937
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:09,300
Oh my gosh.

4938
03:25:09,480 --> 03:25:11,220
I completely forgot about this.

4939
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:15,220
But I hope you guys have been enjoying Blade Runner.

4940
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:17,340
And we can finish it up and...

4941
03:25:18,140 --> 03:25:20,120
Finish up the mystery and everything.

4942
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:20,820
So...

4943
03:25:20,820 --> 03:25:22,020
Thanks for the streaming though.

4944
03:25:22,220 --> 03:25:22,680
Thank you!

4945
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:23,940
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4946
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:25,240
Thanks for watching with me.

4947
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:27,700
I really, really appreciate it.

4948
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:30,900
Always fun to see you play games outside of current trends.

4949
03:25:31,980 --> 03:25:32,700
I try.

4950
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,000
I...

4951
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,980
I try to play a...

4952
03:25:34,980 --> 03:25:35,720
A...

4953
03:25:35,720 --> 03:25:36,600
Variety, you know?

4954
03:25:39,500 --> 03:25:40,020
So...

4955
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:40,860
Thank you for the buzzer.

4956
03:25:40,900 --> 03:25:41,900
It was a nice nostalgia trip.

4957
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:42,660
Hope you get...

4958
03:25:42,660 --> 03:25:44,020
You get...

4959
03:25:44,020 --> 03:25:44,460
Rest, feel better.

4960
03:25:44,580 --> 03:25:45,200
Thank you!

4961
03:25:45,460 --> 03:25:46,240
Eat ice cream.

4962
03:25:46,380 --> 03:25:47,260
Don't kill babies.

4963
03:25:50,040 --> 03:25:50,560
Or...

4964
03:25:50,560 --> 03:25:52,060
Kill ice cream.

4965
03:25:52,280 --> 03:25:53,000
Eat babies.

4966
03:25:54,400 --> 03:25:57,310
Make babies into your briefcase.

4967
03:25:58,810 --> 03:25:59,700
Baby hide.

4968
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:03,980
Baby hide because you're about to be made into a briefcase.

4969
03:26:06,640 --> 03:26:07,540
True.

4970
03:26:08,200 --> 03:26:08,640
Yeah, true.

4971
03:26:09,560 --> 03:26:10,340
Make babies?

4972
03:26:28,900 --> 03:26:29,800
Otsubito!

4973
03:26:30,540 --> 03:26:31,240
Thank you, everybody!

4974
03:26:31,800 --> 03:26:32,480
Itte rasha!

4975
03:26:34,330 --> 03:26:35,100
Bye bye!

4976
03:26:35,760 --> 03:26:38,160
Bye bye!

4977
03:26:39,780 --> 03:26:40,800
Bye bye!

4978
03:26:41,220 --> 03:26:41,680
Thank you!

4979
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:42,400
Itte rasha!

4980
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:43,220
Bye bye!
