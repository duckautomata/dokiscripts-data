1
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,030
Can you hear me?

2
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,370
Oh, yeah, sorry.

3
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,830
I moved my mic yesterday, and so I couldn't...

4
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,790
This is my first time hearing me speak this morning.

5
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,030
So I was like, oh, my voice...

6
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,510
Oh, I just woke up.

7
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,010
Hello.

8
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,470
Sounds windy.

9
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,450
Don't blow away, Minto.

10
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,460
That was weird.

11
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,300
That was a little silly.

12
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
Look back.

13
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,120
Thanks.

14
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,320
Do you guys mind if I make some tea real quick?

15
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,540
Is it okay?

16
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,780
Is it okay if I make some tea real quick?

17
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,080
Shouldn't take long to boil.

18
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
I should have probably done this sooner.

19
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Is the wind really loud?

20
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,600
No.

21
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,980
I'll allow it.

22
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,940
Okay, everybody, Nathaniel said that he allows it, so...

23
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,780
I think that's all the permission I need.

24
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Okay, BRB.

25
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
But I'll still talk.

26
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,460
I won't mute.

27
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,060
I won't mute.

28
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,160
I

29
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,250
walked out of my room yesterday when I was leaving.

30
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,170
I was leaving my hotel, and I was like...

31
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,090
Like, last minute, I was like, oh, my gosh, I'm gonna actually change bags.

32
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,070
Because I was like, I don't want to bring my big...

33
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,090
Or rather, I was like, I want a bag that zips up, you know?

34
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,090
And...

35
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,690
And...

36
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,530
So I went back to my room, and it's one of those, like...

37
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,090
It's an electric, you know?

38
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,550
I mean, well, I guess that's how most locks are now, huh?

39
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,990
But when I would...

40
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,610
When I would do the beep-boop...

41
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,490
It would unlock, but I couldn't open...

42
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,610
I would hear the lock go...

43
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,510
But then it wouldn't open the door.

44
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,310
Ahem.

45
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,750
I've been really busy with work, and I'm...

46
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,090
It's currently nearing 42C.

47
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,630
Send help.

48
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm gonna be on VOD duty for the next few...

49
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,750
Few months?

50
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,030
Saku!

51
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
Few months?

52
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,910
Noooo!

53
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,090
Noooo!

54
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,930
Well, thanks for still watching the VOD.

55
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,630
If you can.

56
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,430
Don't...

57
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,910
You know, no pressure.

58
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,270
If you're too busy, I get it.

59
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:18,870
You know?

60
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,050
I get it.

61
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,810
I get it.

62
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,130
See you later.

63
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,790
Just leave a comment, so I know you're still...

64
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,110
Alive.

65
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,830
I guess.

66
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,290
That's how that works.

67
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,950
Well, I guess if you die too...

68
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,890
Leave a comment as a ghost.

69
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,270
Please buy Wendy's with this.

70
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,790
Oh my gosh, I wanted Wendy's the other day.

71
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,470
Because Wendy's in Japan is not just Wendy's.

72
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,470
It's Wendy's first kitchen.

73
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,890
I love fucking.

74
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,450
And it's...

75
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,930
So it's just so...

76
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,290
But the menu is a little bit different.

77
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,050
The fries are...

78
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,810
Are...

79
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,890
Um...

80
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,590
They have a...

81
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,210
They have a...

82
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,210
What's the word?

83
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:06,930
A...

84
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,350
You can choose what kind of flavor fries you want.

85
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:09,970
So there's like...

86
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,350
Cheese flavor...

87
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,310
Or soy sauce flavor...

88
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,350
And it's basically...

89
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,810
Yeah.

90
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,470
Fa...

91
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:17,950
King.

92
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,110
First kitchen.

93
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,990
What did you guys think I said?

94
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,610
Fa...

95
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,050
King.

96
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,210
Fa...

97
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,750
King.

98
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,870
Fa...

99
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,270
King.

100
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,090
First kitchen.

101
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,910
It's the cool way to shorten it, everybody.

102
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,230
Gosh.

103
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,840
My contribution to Wendy's first kitchen fund.

104
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,440
No, no, no.

105
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,720
The reason I didn't go was because I had food poisoning.

106
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,860
I was like...

107
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,560
Oh my gosh.

108
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,940
I should not go to another burger place.

109
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,700
What's all these gifted all of a sudden?

110
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,440
ViviCore, thank you.

111
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,360
S1, thank you for the 20.

112
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,900
Motsu, welcome to membership.

113
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,520
Thank you.

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,040
My water's done boiling.

115
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,360
Hold on.

116
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,030
Open.

117
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,330
Thanks for the five gifted.

118
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,850
I don't like gifted memberships.

119
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,470
I only like skippity toilet.

120
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,910
Do, welcome to membership.

121
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,250
Wow, what's up?

122
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,230
Thanks for the five gifted.

123
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,330
Thank you, guys.

124
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,550
Teacup, thanks for the five gifted.

125
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,390
No more.

126
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,550
Mint.

127
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,590
Wait up.

128
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,010
Thank you for the five gift.

129
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,730
Thank you guys so much.

130
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,350
Have a boy.

131
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,630
No more.

132
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,590
I don't want any more.

133
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,890
Give us a nice dancer.

134
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,470
I don't need my escape any time now.

135
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,450
Thank you for the 50, Captain!

136
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,310
Holy moly, thank you!

137
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,410
Stop negative two!

138
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,650
Stop it!

139
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,850
Why can't you guys just love me for who I am?

140
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,690
This is so wrong.

141
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,750
Stop it!

142
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,890
Stop it, please!

143
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,630
Maple, not you!

144
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,410
Tuna, not you guys both!

145
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,050
Stop it!

146
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,450
This is so mean.

147
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,630
Anyway, welcome to We Harvest Shadows.

148
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,410
Which is a demo.

149
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,530
As you can see, it says, We Harvest Shadows Demo.

150
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,430
I love this note at the bottom.

151
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,610
I'm away at Gamescom now.

152
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,170
So if you run into any serious issues, let me know.

153
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,710
Fun Comics, thanks for the time!

154
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,210
I just got another new Ace Combat Jacket.

155
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,630
Wait, where?

156
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,990
Oh, I can't show you because of spoilers.

157
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,850
Where though?

158
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,630
Get loved harder, idiot.

159
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,690
Shut up, Ashes!

160
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,550
I don't want to hear that from you!

161
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,910
Oh my gosh, Tri-Princess, thank you!

162
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,730
Thank you so much!

163
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,130
Thank you!

164
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,090
Demo, what?

165
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,390
Demo.

166
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,990
Demo.

167
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,770
It's a demo.

168
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,690
Oh my god, that Ace.

169
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,670
Thank you for the time, Captain!

170
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,270
Thank you!

171
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,830
Thank you!

172
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,870
Thank you!

173
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,870
Thank you!

174
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,870
Thank you!

175
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,870
Thank you!

176
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,270
It's a demo!

177
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,370
But this game looks actually like really promising.

178
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,850
It looks really good.

179
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,470
I don't know.

180
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,770
Maybe it's not like something that a lot of VTubers have been touching on.

181
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,670
So maybe some people don't know about it.

182
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,530
Scarlet Broke, thank you for the five gift cards!

183
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,530
Did you happen to see the Minecraft movie trailer?

184
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,590
Wait, no!

185
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,190
Wait, they actually put up a trailer?

186
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,950
No way.

187
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,830
KZ, thanks for the gift card!

188
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,270
You can appreciate it.

189
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,470
I can appreciate it.

190
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,730
Shut up.

191
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:45,950
Phantom!

192
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,250
Thanks for the gift card!

193
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,150
Wait, should I watch it real quick?

194
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,070
Hashtag Black.

195
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,410
I know!

196
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,730
I know!

197
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,210
I know!

198
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,530
I know!

199
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:52,790
I know!

200
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,770
It's bad.

201
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,250
Wait, it's kinda cringe, but it looks pretty.

202
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,430
Should I do a live reaction?

203
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,710
Thank you!

204
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:03,970
Thank you!

205
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:04,690
Chuu!

206
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,390
Chuu!

207
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,830
Got you!

208
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,010
Oh, you're fast!

209
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,930
You got it!

210
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,990
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

211
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,450
Okay, okay, hold on.

212
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,090
Okay, hold on.

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,210
I want to turn off the sound.

214
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,010
Okay, I'm going to turn off the sound because also, since it's like a trailer...

215
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,390
I don't know.

216
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,850
I feel like Minecraft would try and copyright strike me, right?

217
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,490
Okay, this is my live reaction.

218
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,850
Sorry, hold on.

219
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,730
Let me type a thing up.

220
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,930
First reacting to a Minecraft movie.

221
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,130
Reacting...

222
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,010
Oh, first reacting to Minecraft movie trailer.

223
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,650
That's why the sound is off.

224
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,500
We'll put it right there.

225
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
And then we'll talk...

226
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I want to talk more about this game though.

227
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Okay, Minecraft movie.

228
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm going to have all the wind blowing and stuff.

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
But, you know.

230
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:08,980
Agreed.

231
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,400
Minto needs all the love.

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Even if she's skibbity.

233
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,780
Minus two.

234
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Shut up.

235
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,280
Did she hear about any bracelet from Vishojo?

236
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,980
Bracelet?

237
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,820
Passed it along at Vexpo.

238
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,660
I don't think I've gotten any Vexpo.

239
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
I don't...

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,640
I don't...

241
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,560
I don't think Vexpo was able to...

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,980
I don't know if they were able to accept gifts.

243
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,420
I didn't have anyone accepting...

244
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,920
I will ask them.

245
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,880
Okay, Minecraft movie teaser.

246
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,300
I'm watching now.

247
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Oh, a little...

248
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,120
Little square and turning into...

249
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,060
Oh, the Beatles.

250
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,860
Oh, no.

251
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,440
No, no.

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,040
They're doing that, like, stereotypical trailer thing.

253
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Oh, it looks really weird seeing real people in the Minecraft area.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
It's like an actual child.

255
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,580
Okay.

256
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,020
They're doing, like, that thing.

257
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,080
Oh, the sheep look so ugly.

258
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,470
Yeah, they're doing, like, the...

259
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh, my gosh.

260
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,670
This is so stereotypical.

261
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,270
This is what, like, people make fun of, like, trailers for.

262
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,010
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,170
The little tiny wood in the middle of the wood.

264
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,170
Oh, the creeper.

265
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,430
The creepers look pretty cute, though.

266
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm not going to lie.

267
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:21,850
Ah!

268
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,370
Jack, fuck!

269
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,140
Is this supposed to be, like, Minecraft a long time, like, when Steve grows up and stuff?

270
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,580
What is this dialogue?

271
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,870
Actually, I'm very confused about what is...

272
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,940
Huh?

273
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,400
The piglins all just run past and the little llamas, like...

274
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,900
Oh, April 4th.

275
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
That's a spooky day.

276
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,760
Wow, that was a trailer, you guys.

277
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,140
Oh!

278
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,700
Oh!

279
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,740
I...

280
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,580
Oh...

281
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,440
Oh, gosh.

282
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,440
Block...

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,520
Game for block brain.

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,000
Um...

285
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,620
It looks very pretty, like people said.

286
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,840
Why are there, like, four extra people?

287
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,260
And they're all insufferable.

288
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,700
I don't know anything about them.

289
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,060
I thought it was...

290
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,240
I thought Jack Black was going to be, like, the main character, right?

291
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Like...

292
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,480
I thought that, like, he would...

293
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,040
I thought that he would be, like, Steve going on an adventure.

294
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,260
Right?

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,620
Why are there extra people?

296
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,480
Oh, no.

297
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
Oh, no.

298
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,480
Feels Jumanji-esque.

299
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,680
Maybe.

300
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,220
Is it an Isekai?

301
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,800
It looks like it.

302
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,580
Minecraft meets Jumanji.

303
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,780
Hmm...

304
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,660
Ah...

305
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,100
Oh, I guess we'll see.

306
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know.

307
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,700
It might get Sonic-movied, you guys.

308
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,960
You know, people might just be like, Yo, this ain't it.

309
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,780
And they're like, okay.

310
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,620
Redo!

311
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,760
We'll see.

312
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,560
We'll see.

313
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,780
André goes next to the Tony Gifton!

314
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
Yeah, we'll see.

315
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,800
Though, honestly...

316
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,740
Please.

317
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,680
I want them to release the ugly Sonic movie so bad.

318
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,060
I want that.

319
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,660
Just like how I want Butthole Cat.

320
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,060
Just release it.

321
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,120
Like, the world kind of wants this, right?

322
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:58,940
Right!

323
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,920
Like...

324
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,620
Just to experience it.

325
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,580
What we could have had.

326
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,540
Maybe it's like Overlord where Jack Black fell asleep playing Minecraft and woke up in the game.

327
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe.

328
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,640
Like, I see some people being like, Why didn't he, like, you know, cut his hair?

329
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,480
Like, why didn't he look the part of Steve?

330
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,580
But maybe it's like a, I'm Steve.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
I've been in the game...

332
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,520
Forever.

333
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,040
You know...

334
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,140
I'm...

335
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,540
I've...

336
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,440
I've just been here.

337
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm Wild Steve.

338
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
I'm Wild Steve!

339
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,140
You know?

340
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,260
Give us the true cat.

341
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,380
Release the call of the wild with the man instead of the CG doc.

342
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Okay, I don't know what that's referencing.

343
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,780
Anyway.

344
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,040
That was exciting.

345
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,980
Thank you for first Minecraft movie trailer.

346
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,920
Reaction.

347
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,640
Real time.

348
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,020
Hashtag release the Butthole Cut.

349
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,500
Phantom 2024.

350
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
This game...

351
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,360
Is like...

352
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,720
A farm simulator.

353
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,840
But it's also quite spooky.

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,240
Um...

355
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,180
It's a demo.

356
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
So it's not very long.

357
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,180
But it's also quite several hours long.

358
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,160
I don't think I'm gonna be able to complete the demo.

359
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,340
Um...

360
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,380
Because...

361
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,580
Did you like how they had to put both a sheep chewing to start and an end with a llama chewing?

362
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,120
Just to show how funny quirky the movie is.

363
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,740
Also cats 2019 watch along.

364
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,660
You promised.

365
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,000
I did promise all those years ago.

366
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,620
You try and not know about those things.

367
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,180
Cjdog vs.

368
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,760
Jpegsdog.

369
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh my gosh, they've been so funny.

370
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:44,800
Oh -o.

371
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,380
They finally got corpse andraik too.

372
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:49,960
That's better than downhill.

373
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
I don't know if you hear this.

374
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,420
One, two, three!

375
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,800
I am going with the best but.

376
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,420
Friends!

377
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,260
Oh my gosh, I'm meeting with friends!

378
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,420
And we're gonna go do some fun girly stuff.

379
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,840
So I'm excited about that.

380
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,480
And I touched grass yesterday too.

381
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,880
Actually, Matara and I went to Disney Sea.

382
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,140
And we had a lot of fun.

383
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,080
And we'll talk about it later so that we can actually have stuff to talk about.

384
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,080
But you know how much I love Indiana Jones.

385
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
So you know.

386
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,160
Yeah.

387
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,180
But I also got to ride some stuff I had never ridden before.

388
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
So I was very excited.

389
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,260
It was just such nice weather.

390
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,560
Not a lot of people.

391
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,860
It's kind of perfect.

392
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Touching grass, Tex.

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,180
Start new game!

394
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,360
Since I don't have so much time since I'm meeting with people in a couple of hours.

395
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,440
I shall start the game and play.

396
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,680
Let's go.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,420
Those eyes.

398
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,740
That demonic face.

399
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,080
Me?

400
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,060
In the rearview mirror.

401
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,880
Rearview mirror?

402
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
That's when it all started.

403
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,320
Wait, I'm covering the subtitles.

404
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,660
It was the morning after everything went down.

405
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,680
There's a face in the mirror?

406
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,840
I didn't have anyone anymore.

407
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm scared.

408
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,740
I got into my mom's old truck to drive back to New York like I always do.

409
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
But something happened that I can't explain.

410
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,680
What happened?

411
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,400
I saw my exit, turned on the blinker, and drove right past it.

412
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,100
Oh, okay.

413
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,340
Oh, wait, there?

414
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,320
It sounds crazy, but I physically could not turn the wheel.

415
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,880
Oh my god.

416
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,140
Because I have no hands!

417
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,860
Sorry, there is a face in the mirror.

418
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,600
Oh my god.

419
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,360
Sorry, that scared me.

420
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,900
I was in a rush to nowhere.

421
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,260
So I drove, empty-headed and exhausted.

422
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,620
Wow, it's actually so beautiful.

423
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,440
That's when I saw it.

424
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,040
It felt like the only right thing to happen to me in years.

425
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,780
Someone in my car!

426
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
Wait, it's only a two-seater!

427
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,600
How is there someone in the back?

428
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,460
I locked the gate and left everyone behind.

429
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,840
It would cost me everything I had, but I needed solitude.

430
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,300
His voice is so good.

431
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, I can jump.

432
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,300
Oh.

433
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,560
So I bought the farm.

434
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,240
There was a farm?

435
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,040
I did lock the gate, and I did throw away the key as hard as I could.

436
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,440
Bye, key!

437
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,780
Bye, key!

438
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
I started laughing out of sheer joy.

439
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,880
Bye, key!

440
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Bye, key!

441
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,680
When was the last time that I laughed?

442
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,020
I couldn't believe I was actually doing it.

443
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,620
The music is so nice.

444
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,560
Why is my car covered in leaves?

445
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,640
You made me a promise, Garrick, you older woman.

446
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,240
Oh, sorry.

447
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm blocking the subtitles.

448
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm so sorry.

449
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,580
What's going on?

450
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,300
It's probably not what you expected, but I'm going to keep that promise, mom.

451
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,080
Should I run?

452
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm running.

453
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,620
Where's

454
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,340
my house?

455
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,780
So I bought a farm.

456
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,830
Um, yep.

457
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,790
I did that.

458
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,730
What's going on?

459
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,850
The music is a bit loud.

460
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,650
I'm gonna turn it down some, yeah.

461
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,970
Day one.

462
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,910
The unseen wanderer.

463
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,590
All right, Garrick.

464
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,950
Today's the day.

465
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,870
You're gonna leave the house.

466
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,970
Oh, boy!

467
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,770
Hold your paws, everyone.

468
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,470
Oh, boy!

469
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,810
Where did I put that to-do list?

470
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,170
Oh!

471
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,070
If I can find it in all this garbage.

472
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,210
I have a journal.

473
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:47,690
This one?

474
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,410
Read?

475
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,410
Um, press right click.

476
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,930
Oh, press F to use your flashlight.

477
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,830
Oh, my gosh!

478
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,490
This is my house!

479
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,070
This is where I'm living?

480
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,990
This has black mold all over it.

481
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,170
I'm trying to...

482
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,850
I'm pressing right click, but nothing's working.

483
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,590
Why can't I read it?

484
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,070
Why do I have leaves in my house?

485
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,050
Why am I living like this?

486
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,710
Do I have like a battery?

487
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,050
Most of these times, these games have like a battery, you know?

488
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,410
It's...

489
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,010
Right click is...

490
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,330
Oh, wait.

491
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,930
Is it left click?

492
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,630
Oh, my God.

493
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,150
Well, TV would have been nice with a whole being alone for everything.

494
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:20,950
Oh, okay.

495
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,930
Thanks to remember.

496
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,170
Check my to-do list every day.

497
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,850
Don't forget to use tools.

498
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,910
There should be some laying around the house.

499
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,870
I can buy more in the mail order catalog.

500
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,590
Get to bed on time.

501
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,350
These woods give me the creeps.

502
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,250
Drop things in the trailer to sell them.

503
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,770
Tree logs are worth a few cents, but tomatoes and chicken eggs are more...

504
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,550
Much more valuable.

505
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:39,970
Okay.

506
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,650
Sorry, guys.

507
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,310
I didn't realize...

508
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,950
It was left click.

509
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,650
But the right click was the one that was highlighted, okay?

510
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,070
My ultimate goal should be buying the rifle.

511
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,310
But I'll work on my to-do list for the first few days and save up some cash.

512
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,090
This is the rest of my life now.

513
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,890
Forever alone in the best way possible.

514
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,230
However, I did send one letter after buying this place.

515
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,190
He's the only one who has my address.

516
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,990
I wonder when he'll get here.

517
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,410
Okay.

518
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,410
Look.

519
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:11,630
I...

520
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,690
I have all this dirt.

521
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:12,890
Oh!

522
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,450
The sun is rising!

523
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,650
What a beautiful day!

524
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,430
I need to find my to-do list first.

525
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,170
Okay.

526
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,710
Where is that?

527
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,010
In here?

528
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:23,910
Oh.

529
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,030
My clothes.

530
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,610
Nothing but the clothes on my back, huh?

531
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,030
Oh, gross.

532
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,010
Why are we stuffing our...

533
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,350
Why are we keeping our stuff in here?

534
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,630
This is...

535
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,570
Where...

536
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,090
To...

537
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,250
Oh!

538
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,950
There's my to-do list.

539
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,790
Phew.

540
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,270
Okay.

541
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,590
My to-do list is...

542
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,070
Essential.

543
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,170
Press tab to view my tasks.

544
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,550
Okay.

545
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,790
He wears JPEGs.

546
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,150
Tasks marked with an asterisk are required to progress the story.

547
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,430
Completing an optional or required task usually earns you money as well.

548
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,270
You can view...

549
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,350
Look at this!

550
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,650
Okay.

551
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,490
I'm sorry.

552
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,990
But if you see the...

553
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,430
That...

554
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,690
Doesn't it look like right click?

555
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,090
The right part is like so much more dominating than the left one, right?

556
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,570
View your money and important items at the bottom of the...

557
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:11,890
Notepad.

558
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,550
Oh, I'm blocking it.

559
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,550
Now, time for the greatest dopamine release possible.

560
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,290
Cleaning your room and scratching it off your to-do list.

561
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,790
All right.

562
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,030
Okay.

563
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,330
Hold on.

564
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,130
Pause game.

565
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,050
Let's see.

566
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,210
How do I want to move myself?

567
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,710
I might have to be in a box, you guys.

568
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,790
Wait.

569
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,370
Oh, but everything's on like the right left side.

570
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,030
I might have to go to the right side, everybody.

571
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,690
Actually, what if I just...

572
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,130
Oh my gosh.

573
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,690
I'm going to do a real YouTuber thing.

574
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,050
I'm going to put...

575
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,850
myself in the corner.

576
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,470
I'm going to put myself in the corner, you guys.

577
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,130
With my big face.

578
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,480
Wow.

579
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,560
Wow.

580
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm a YouTuber.

581
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,860
I'm in the corner.

582
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm in the corner.

583
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,080
I'm in the corner.

584
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,420
Mental reaction corner.

585
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,200
Wait, what was it?

586
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,540
Okay.

587
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,680
Pick up trash in the bedroom and throw it in the trailer.

588
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
All right, baby.

589
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,820
Baby.

590
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,680
Buy a watering can.

591
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh, when I'm holding it, I like can't move.

592
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,780
Buy a watering can and water six tomato plants.

593
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,040
All right.

594
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,060
Let's pick up this trash.

595
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,000
All these leaves.

596
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,180
Oh, yeah.

597
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,040
Oh, yeah.

598
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,480
Oh, yeah.

599
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,100
Oh, yeah.

600
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,540
Oh, yeah.

601
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,300
Oh, yeah.

602
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,580
Oh, yeah.

603
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:33,960
Oh, yeah.

604
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,320
Oh, yeah.

605
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,640
Oh, yeah.

606
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,880
Carry.

607
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,700
Carry.

608
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:36,960
Carry.

609
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,200
Oh my gosh.

610
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
We're the best cleaners ever.

611
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
There's this trash too.

612
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,920
Pick it up.

613
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,520
Pick it up.

614
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:44,900
Pick it up.

615
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,460
Pick it up.

616
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,100
Pick it.

617
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,560
Pick.

618
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,320
Where's the...

619
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,380
Oh.

620
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,680
There.

621
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,700
This is heavy.

622
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,300
It's heavier than it looks.

623
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:50,880
Yeah.

624
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,560
Okay.

625
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,080
All right.

626
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,340
Trailer.

627
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,780
Oh, our whole place is...

628
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,280
It's lighting up.

629
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,600
Hold on.

630
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,040
We gotta go find a thing first.

631
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,080
The trailer.

632
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,980
This is where we...

633
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,580
What we bought.

634
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,100
Trailer.

635
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,480
Over here.

636
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,660
Man, it's pretty here.

637
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,740
Not a soul for miles.

638
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,520
Wow.

639
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,240
I should have done this years ago.

640
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,900
I also...

641
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,700
Drop it.

642
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay.

643
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,760
That wasn't bad.

644
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,820
Maybe I can get these tomatoes watered and then I'll be done.

645
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,260
Toot.

646
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,620
I also turned the graphics down because I'm on my laptop.

647
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,220
But...

648
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,260
Wow.

649
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,540
Look at our little...

650
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:37,980
area.

651
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,840
It's not so bad.

652
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,720
Looks fine for a laptop.

653
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,460
Yeah.

654
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm just saying it could look even better.

655
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,080
What else we got around here?

656
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,460
I got stamina at the bottom.

657
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,820
Oh gosh.

658
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,860
Okay.

659
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,980
Hot damn.

660
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,660
This doesn't even look that old.

661
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:58,800
Hot dag.

662
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,300
I could totally fix this up with the right parts.

663
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:02,920
Yeah.

664
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,780
Okay.

665
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,060
Oh.

666
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,120
Oh.

667
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,760
Let's also...

668
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,000
Sorry.

669
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,940
Audio.

670
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,160
Let's do music volume like half that.

671
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,860
Replace copyrighted songs.

672
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh my gosh.

673
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,760
Thank goodness.

674
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,500
I saw that.

675
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,000
That should be better.

676
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Was this the front door?

677
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,300
This is where I eat and sleep.

678
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,280
Well, then I have like a little speck on my laptop and it's making me think it's like my middle cursor.

679
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,620
So now we buy a watering can?

680
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
How do I buy?

681
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,380
But also this was glowing, wasn't it?

682
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
I don't remember this being here.

683
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,400
The painting.

684
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,020
Keep an eye on the mysterious painting of the hallway.

685
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,260
The painting.

686
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:03,080
It will change in subtle and sometimes not so subtle ways to signify your mental state and alert you to danger.

687
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,880
The more horrifying the painting, the more danger you are in.

688
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,940
The painting.

689
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
Oh, there's like something.

690
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,500
There's like people staring at me.

691
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,560
Do you see that?

692
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,220
There's like people staring at me through the hallway.

693
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,520
Ew, I don't like that.

694
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,120
Ok, so it's slightly horrifying right now.

695
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,080
What's this?

696
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,460
Oh, a map of the area?

697
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,780
Looks like it's missing some pages.

698
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,080
Map and compassion.

699
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,460
Spooky!

700
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,440
Access your map by holding Q.

701
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,100
But you will first need to visit lookout towers.

702
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,440
Ohhh!

703
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,260
So that's what that was over there.

704
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,380
If you have found all items in a certain location, a checkmark will be added to the icon.

705
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,160
If you have found all items in a certain location, a checkmark will be added to the icon.

706
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Oh!

707
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Oh, that was over there!

708
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,940
No in-game waypoint markers, so be sure to slow down, study your map, and plan your next move with resolve.

709
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,220
Okay, so, um, everybody who's lost, that sucks for you.

710
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,180
Oh, no, no, no.

711
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,620
Go away.

712
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,360
Go away.

713
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,180
Okay.

714
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,760
Interesting.

715
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,980
Our little... oh, that's a lot of...

716
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,560
That's a lot of beans!

717
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,960
Cans of beans as far as the eye can see.

718
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Oh my god!

719
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Okay.

720
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,460
Cool.

721
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,680
We're covered, everybody.

722
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,660
What's in here?

723
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,780
I have a feeling we're not showering.

724
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,360
You can flush the toilet.

725
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,260
Awesome.

726
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,800
Did I just hear, like, the toilet even, like, reload?

727
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,840
That's crazy.

728
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,700
So how do I buy a watering can?

729
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,840
He said, like, over here, right?

730
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,380
Or something?

731
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh, what's this?

732
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,320
This is the catalog.

733
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,040
Yes, yes, yes.

734
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,240
We have a dollar!

735
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,080
Buy.

736
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,820
Oh my gosh!

737
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,660
Oh, and here.

738
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,680
Here's our hold.

739
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,240
Oh, okay.

740
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,820
That worked.

741
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,060
Okay.

742
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,920
Easy.

743
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,240
Easy peasy.

744
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,300
Okay.

745
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,320
Awesome.

746
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,760
We did it!

747
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,220
Oh my gosh, we got a dollar!

748
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,700
You can go to bed early if you complete your to-do list.

749
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,060
Well, it did say...

750
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,620
It wasn't a lot, but it was something.

751
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,820
I better get to bed.

752
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,360
One day down, eternity to go.

753
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,260
Oh!

754
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,020
What was that?

755
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,340
Who keeps knocking on something?

756
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,220
There's, like, a pounding.

757
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,720
Gosh, maybe this was a bad idea.

758
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,160
I'm so scared in my hotel room.

759
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,160
At least when I'm home, I'm with, like, my cats.

760
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,580
But, like...

761
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,200
You know...

762
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,040
The ghost.

763
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,800
Sorry, that was me.

764
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,460
Stop!

765
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,740
Why am I going to bed so early?

766
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,400
I just woke up.

767
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,880
There's so much more to explore and see and everything.

768
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,940
Can I leave?

769
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,940
I want to see what's over there.

770
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,160
Okay.

771
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,780
Why did we buy this place?

772
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,500
Why was this even for sale?

773
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,020
This looks abandoned, you know?

774
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
What else can I buy?

775
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,600
Let's see.

776
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,590
I guess it is starting to get, like...

777
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,790
Oh!

778
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,050
Oh!

779
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,630
Carry?

780
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,770
We got some stones?

781
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,710
Can I sell these?

782
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,430
Oh my gosh!

783
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,930
They're worth 10 cents!

784
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,330
Collect the stones!

785
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,150
Collect the stones!

786
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,390
Oh my gosh.

787
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,770
We're going to go crazy spending spree here.

788
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,230
$20.

789
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:39,630
Okay.

790
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,190
I want the axe.

791
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,490
Oh, $15?

792
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,510
Okay.

793
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,790
Okay.

794
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,850
Okay.

795
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,730
We're going to have to sell some tomatoes first.

796
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,310
I got it.

797
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:49,790
I got it.

798
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,750
10 cent rocks.

799
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,930
Someone's buying it.

800
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,730
Probably.

801
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,250
Immediately.

802
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,510
Any more rocks?

803
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,190
Any more rocks?

804
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,930
Any more big old stones?

805
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:01,590
Oh!

806
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,450
We have a back door here.

807
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,130
Good to know.

808
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,150
It's a little...

809
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,370
What's this room?

810
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,910
It's rusted shut.

811
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,010
Yeah.

812
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,830
That's the reason.

813
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,010
Whoa!

814
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,210
It's already starting to get so dark.

815
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,740
Shut the door.

816
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,900
Shut the door.

817
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,600
I don't like this.

818
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,180
I don't like this.

819
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,720
I don't like this.

820
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,180
I don't like this.

821
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,220
Check the painting.

822
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,660
I did.

823
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:38,960
I did.

824
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,240
I did.

825
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,660
It's still people looking at us.

826
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,740
Who is trading 10 rocks for a watering can.

827
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,130
Oh!

828
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,490
The window's open, you guys!

829
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,010
It's the window!

830
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,810
Huh.

831
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,050
Huh.

832
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,830
Flush any bad spirits out the house.

833
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,470
Flushed.

834
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,970
Flushed.

835
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,470
Flushed.

836
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,290
Oh my gosh.

837
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,250
It's starting to get dark.

838
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,690
It's starting to get dark.

839
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,810
Why is the painting glowing?

840
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,150
Oh!

841
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,570
They...

842
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,090
Ah!

843
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,410
Wee!

844
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,550
Okay.

845
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,210
Let's go to bed!

846
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,270
Wait.

847
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,130
Can we turn the lights on?

848
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,010
Oh, thank God.

849
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,170
Oh, thank God.

850
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,730
Oh, we got a nice little fireplace.

851
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,490
Light that up.

852
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:34,750
No?

853
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,190
Okay.

854
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:35,790
Never mind.

855
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,730
Why don't we have like a radio or something, you know?

856
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,230
I guess we can go...

857
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,930
Go to bed.

858
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:45,810
Okay.

859
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,490
Let's just go to sleep.

860
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,370
Let's go to sleep, everybody.

861
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,010
Oh!

862
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,390
Wait!

863
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,370
I cleaned up my room!

864
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:53,870
What is this?

865
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,250
Wait.

866
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:56,870
Huh?

867
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,670
What does it say?

868
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,230
Check.

869
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,050
Check.

870
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:00,810
Check.

871
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,170
Check.

872
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,390
Check.

873
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:01,610
Check.

874
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:01,770
Check.

875
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,550
Okay.

876
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,190
The ghost wants us to read.

877
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,200
Um...

878
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,720
This is all still the same.

879
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,580
Okay.

880
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,160
Good night!

881
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,640
Oh my gosh.

882
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,220
I thought something was gonna be on the ceiling.

883
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,220
How is this guy paying for utilities?

884
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,640
All right!

885
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,000
Day two!

886
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,600
All right.

887
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,620
Day one was pretty easy.

888
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Good night!

889
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,180
Good morning, Minto!

890
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,100
What is that?

891
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:38,940
A sheep?

892
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,260
Have I already been blessed with...

893
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,140
What's my to-do list?

894
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,180
Collect tomatoes!

895
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,740
Buy...

896
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
Buy the build book.

897
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,820
Build a chicken coop.

898
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,220
Glowing animal.

899
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,920
I've been blessed with a sheep!

900
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,580
In the early hours!

901
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,200
We can now collect other stuff!

902
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,700
Good morning!

903
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,320
Oh!

904
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,120
The hand is gone.

905
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,600
All right.

906
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,080
Everything is fine.

907
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,060
Let's go check out our new...

908
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,180
Newly added...

909
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,800
We're gonna...

910
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,920
We collected the trash in our room, but we're just gonna ignore everything else in here.

911
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,440
It's totally fine.

912
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,160
Where...

913
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,320
Oh, maybe it was the other side.

914
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,480
This way?

915
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,780
This way?

916
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,480
The glowing animal.

917
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,580
Whoa.

918
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,200
The power company will accept 6,435 rocks.

919
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:35,860
Huh?

920
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,780
Oh, wait!

921
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,480
There's a person there, too!

922
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,820
What is that?

923
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,480
There's a person there, too.

924
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,340
Hello?

925
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh, that's not a sheep.

926
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,840
That's a deer?

927
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh.

928
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,600
And a ghost...

929
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,220
Person.

930
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,800
Lady?

931
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,140
Claire?

932
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,800
Whoa!

933
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,740
Whoa!

934
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,220
Whoa!

935
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,200
You remind me of something.

936
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,740
You remind me of someone, girl.

937
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,860
She can...

938
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,440
Oh!

939
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,640
Oh!

940
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:00,960
Oh!

941
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,340
Oh my gosh.

942
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,720
I thought...

943
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,420
I thought we were on the road for a second.

944
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Are you gonna keep up or what?

945
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:08,960
Oh, sorry.

946
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm sorry.

947
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,960
I just can't get over this view.

948
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:11,940
Wow.

949
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,060
I can't believe you've never crossed the bridge before.

950
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah, but why leave downtown anyway?

951
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,840
To come see me, obviously.

952
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,540
Oh my gosh.

953
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh my god.

954
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,020
Oh my god.

955
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,720
Sorry, Claire.

956
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,040
Probably the best point.

957
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,500
Hudson River.

958
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,580
Oh!

959
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,540
Is that a deer?

960
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,080
How did a deer get here?

961
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,380
How did she even get here?

962
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:29,820
Yeah.

963
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,760
Hold on.

964
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,460
Give us some space.

965
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,060
Oh, okay.

966
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,440
We've gotta help it.

967
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,280
Okay, I'm gonna help him.

968
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,000
Right now.

969
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,780
Oh.

970
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,260
Oh!

971
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
The deer turned into the barn.

972
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,800
It's okay.

973
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,000
It's okay.

974
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,080
Let's get you home.

975
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,120
Oh no.

976
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,100
Did we kill our wife?

977
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,400
Is that one of these situations?

978
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,140
Claire.

979
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,680
Do you ever think about me?

980
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,040
Oh.

981
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,600
She's alive?

982
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,960
Like I think about you.

983
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,420
Oh.

984
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,180
Do you ever wonder where I am?

985
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
Claire, I'm obsessed with you.

986
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:00,780
It doesn't matter.

987
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,660
Oh.

988
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,520
Get back to work, Garrett.

989
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,060
That's all you're good for.

990
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
Garrett's got some troubles.

991
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,180
That's okay.

992
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,520
We understand you, Garrett.

993
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,980
All right.

994
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,600
Oh my gosh.

995
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,460
Tomatoes!

996
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,380
He said tomatoes were worth a lot.

997
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,680
We collected 10 tomatoes.

998
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,040
Oh.

999
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,520
These are not market, you know?

1000
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:26,720
These are not market.

1001
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,360
These are like...

1002
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Wow.

1003
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,180
These are like...

1004
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,540
People pay less for the deformed ones, you know?

1005
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,580
Wow.

1006
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,940
Where did this axe come from?

1007
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,200
Wait.

1008
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,900
Now this should come in handy.

1009
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,360
Five dollars for...

1010
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,700
Wait.

1011
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,740
We just got a free axe.

1012
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,820
No way.

1013
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,580
Jeez, ghost.

1014
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,260
You live like this.

1015
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:46,940
Your farm is filthy.

1016
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I just moved here.

1017
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,940
I think.

1018
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,300
I think.

1019
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,060
I think.

1020
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,080
I think.

1021
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,740
I think.

1022
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,580
I think.

1023
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,080
Oh.

1024
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,020
I just moved here.

1025
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,540
Holy cow.

1026
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,120
Okay.

1027
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,520
I think I'm insane.

1028
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,080
I think I'm a superhuman.

1029
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm carrying half a tree.

1030
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,960
Don't destroy your fence.

1031
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,240
And I'm walking very slowly.

1032
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,280
I can't even sprint.

1033
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,080
The music disappeared.

1034
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,940
It's just us.

1035
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,200
In the wilderness.

1036
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,600
You know, when I see stuff like this, I'm like, yeah, maybe.

1037
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,880
Maybe.

1038
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,320
I don't know.

1039
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,860
Only 50 cents for a tree?

1040
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,460
Come on!

1041
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:46,240
I think like, you know, when I see like this, I'm just like, Oh, baby, it would be so nice to just get away from it all, you know, to just like...

1042
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Oh, we have to build the build book.

1043
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,240
But then I see at night and I'm like, you know what?

1044
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,480
Never mind.

1045
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,400
I think I'm fine living in my maid cafe where it's nice and bright all the time.

1046
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,780
No idols.

1047
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,980
There's be no nothing.

1048
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,300
Hercules.

1049
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,060
I know this guy.

1050
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,920
He was built for the outdoors.

1051
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,620
He can even jump!

1052
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,000
He's insane!

1053
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,840
Go, Garrett, go!

1054
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,080
Okay.

1055
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,660
How do I now build the build book?

1056
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,980
Oh, we can get a rake?

1057
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,700
Farming?

1058
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,300
Build book!

1059
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,260
Five dollars.

1060
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,840
Okay.

1061
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,680
Okay, you got this.

1062
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,680
Just follow the instructions, bro.

1063
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,560
Follow the instructions, bro.

1064
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,800
What are we building?

1065
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
What does it say?

1066
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,960
To build a chicken coop!

1067
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,320
Where do we want to put our chickens?

1068
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,820
Probably away from the fence.

1069
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,880
Garrett's talking to himself.

1070
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,020
Who else can he talk to?

1071
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,060
Garrett is lonely.

1072
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,380
Garrett's...

1073
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,520
Oh my gosh.

1074
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,160
I'm like freaking out over like...

1075
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,020
What if I see someone standing in my house?

1076
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,960
Oh, is there not a fence this way?

1077
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,220
Oh, so this is how we leave.

1078
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,600
Wait.

1079
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,460
Oh, no.

1080
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,860
Wait, the fence is huge.

1081
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,740
Oh, there's a path though.

1082
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,180
Okay.

1083
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,260
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1084
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,800
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1085
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,200
This is another road.

1086
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,540
I'm sliding.

1087
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,440
Where does all this go?

1088
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,800
Wait, does this...

1089
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,520
Oh, I should probably build my chicken coop, right?

1090
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,180
Are those wheat or grass?

1091
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,380
Wheat, maybe?

1092
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
Maybe we have all the farm we need, right?

1093
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,200
Okay, let's build a chicken coop.

1094
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,960
Build structures?

1095
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,940
Oh, fencing?

1096
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,740
Wait, how do I build a chicken coop?

1097
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,080
Not in my build book.

1098
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,500
In here?

1099
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,580
Oh.

1100
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,240
Chicken kit.

1101
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,460
Well, I have to buy the kit.

1102
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,380
Okay.

1103
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:18,900
Oh.

1104
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,680
Okay, the birds are...

1105
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,740
Oh, the sun is...

1106
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,780
Oh, the sun is going down.

1107
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,820
Oh my god!

1108
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,460
Oh my god!

1109
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,700
There is somebody in my house!

1110
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,780
Oh, beep.

1111
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,940
Okay, time to build the chicken coop.

1112
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,660
Wait, structures?

1113
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,640
Oh no, I need ten dollars!

1114
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,660
Uh-oh, you guys, the sun is going down.

1115
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,740
The sun is going down.

1116
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,740
Uh-oh.

1117
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,260
Wait.

1118
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,880
Um, my to-do list.

1119
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,400
Build a chicken coop.

1120
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,200
I think I have to build a chicken coop.

1121
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,300
Oh gosh.

1122
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:52,980
Wait.

1123
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh!

1124
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm scared.

1125
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:54,860
Wait.

1126
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,400
I'm scared.

1127
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,460
I don't want to go inside and I don't want to go outside.

1128
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,560
Uh-oh.

1129
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,080
Um.

1130
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:00,760
Uh.

1131
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,060
I'm scared.

1132
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,540
Swing!

1133
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:07,960
Swing!

1134
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:08,740
Swing!

1135
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,200
Swing!

1136
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,740
Bada-bada-bada-bada!

1137
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,400
Swing!

1138
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,180
Bada-bada-bada-bada!

1139
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,840
Do it tomorrow?

1140
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,360
Okay.

1141
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:15,880
Yeah.

1142
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,980
I'm just gonna...

1143
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm scared right now.

1144
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,690
Is this creepy music or good music?

1145
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,250
This is music music.

1146
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,370
Who's using this lookout tower, I wonder?

1147
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,110
There's even a little flag on it.

1148
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:32,850
Okay.

1149
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:33,770
Okay.

1150
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,190
The music is coming from this direction.

1151
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,480
Music coming from inside the house.

1152
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,440
I think.

1153
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,100
Oh my god!

1154
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,780
I don't know what that is.

1155
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,500
Um.

1156
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,280
Um.

1157
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,660
You guys?

1158
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,080
I think there's something wrong.

1159
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,380
I think, uh...

1160
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,220
What's happening?

1161
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,660
Um.

1162
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,980
I think we should go to bed.

1163
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,320
Shut the door.

1164
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,520
Let's go upstairs.

1165
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,140
It's not the TV.

1166
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,500
Let's just go to sleep.

1167
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,680
My to-do list isn't complete yet!

1168
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1169
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:12,880
Wait.

1170
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,040
Everything's red.

1171
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,440
Um.

1172
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,100
You guys?

1173
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,160
I think I'm dead.

1174
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:17,980
Oh.

1175
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,060
I think I'm dead.

1176
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,880
I'm dead, dead, die, die.

1177
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,440
Die, die, die.

1178
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:20,880
Die, die, die.

1179
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,600
Wait.

1180
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,480
No, really?

1181
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:22,960
Seriously?

1182
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,900
I have to do my comp- Oh my god, no.

1183
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,800
I don't even have enough money to make up!

1184
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,540
I don't have enough money!

1185
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,720
I only have six dollars!

1186
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,480
Dead on day two?

1187
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,100
Can I just wait for, um, for it to turn to day?

1188
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,140
Oh, wait.

1189
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,420
Oh!

1190
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,080
Thank goodness!

1191
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh my gosh.

1192
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,620
Oh!

1193
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,140
Oh!

1194
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:47,980
Oh!

1195
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,360
Oh!

1196
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:48,580
Oh!

1197
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,840
Oh, you couldn't see cause I was blocking it.

1198
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,880
A bed appeared in the top left, top right corner.

1199
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,080
Oh gosh.

1200
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,520
That was spookiness.

1201
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,700
I don't even know what was going on, but that was spookiness.

1202
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,520
I did not like, I did not like that one bit.

1203
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,000
I did not like that one bit.

1204
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,540
Okay, it's back to normal.

1205
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,580
Oh my gosh, it's back to normal.

1206
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,200
Yeah, you hear those wolves?

1207
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,360
We're building a chicken coop, but, oh, I guess this is okay now to go outside.

1208
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,060
Let's get my axe, just in case there's any...

1209
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,780
The birds are chirping!

1210
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,820
The day is beautiful!

1211
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,600
Oh my god.

1212
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,060
Oh, that was really spooky.

1213
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,300
Check the to-do list.

1214
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,700
Build a chicken coop!

1215
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,440
Okay, let's carry our logs, everybody.

1216
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,500
That was fine.

1217
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,440
That was, that was scary.

1218
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,100
I don't know.

1219
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,980
I don't know what was in the painting.

1220
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,060
I wonder if something happens every night.

1221
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,200
Like maybe something, like maybe a different monster happens each night or something.

1222
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,880
Like the first night we had the hand and then this night we had the Babadook.

1223
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,800
Forgot the water.

1224
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,500
Wait, no, I watered, right?

1225
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,240
Water?

1226
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,880
Oh, water.

1227
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,860
Water.

1228
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,020
They're all watered.

1229
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:29,920
All good.

1230
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,540
Oh wait, there was, I think, what was it?

1231
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,300
The rake, right?

1232
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,020
Should I buy this and then plant more tomatoes?

1233
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,020
Tomato seed.

1234
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,200
Practically unlimited supply of seeds.

1235
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,600
Ooh, use the rake to plant them.

1236
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:49,620
Maybe.

1238
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,280
One singular droplet for each tomato.

1239
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,260
Okay.

1240
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,740
Hmph, I wish I could move the trailer closer.

1241
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,900
Do axes work on ghosts?

1242
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,840
I can't say that they do.

1243
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,480
But you know.

1244
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,400
Oh gosh, when they chirped like that before, there was somebody in my house.

1245
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,640
Come on, stop tripping over the logs.

1246
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
See guys, this is just like Stardew Valley.

1247
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,600
Where things come out at night, try to kill you.

1248
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,440
Ooh.

1249
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,520
Ooh.

1250
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,620
I wonder who died here.

1251
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,320
Old man Jenkins.

1252
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,020
Oh no, can I not get that log because it's outside the fence?

1253
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,540
Forgot my flashlight is on this whole time.

1254
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,940
I can't get this log because it's outside the fence.

1255
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,700
Oh man.

1256
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,640
Yeah, just like in Stardew Valley.

1257
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,020
Cut down the tree so it falls towards the cart.

1258
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,320
Oh.

1259
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,920
Are you a genius?

1260
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,660
Wait, oh, I guess that worked.

1261
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,320
Did that work?

1262
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,160
Yeah?

1263
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,880
Okay, let's try it, let's try it.

1264
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,620
This way, right?

1265
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,800
Tim!

1266
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,660
Oh wait, it's gonna fall towards my house!

1267
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,160
Timber!

1268
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,600
Oh my gosh, genius, genius, genius, genius.

1269
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,300
Genius!

1270
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,080
Wait, where are you going?

1271
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,410
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho.

1272
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,390
Now we should be able to build a chicken coop.

1273
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,910
How much money do we have anyway?

1274
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:38,230
$11!

1275
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,530
All right, let's put this one in here.

1276
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,090
Build our chicken coop.

1277
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,310
Oh, no, sorry.

1278
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,010
Build book.

1279
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,910
Chicken coop.

1280
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:51,910
Oh, it's $10?

1281
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,710
Wait, I have to pay to learn how to build it and then pay for it itself?

1282
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,230
That's ridiculous.

1283
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,730
This is a nice area for the chickens.

1284
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,530
Is that my room, right?

1285
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,730
I can wake up and see the chickens every morning.

1286
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,110
Oh, oh, what did I just do?

1287
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,310
Wait, huh?

1288
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,090
Oh, I just, there we go.

1289
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:19,970
Okay.

1290
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,350
Standing torch.

1291
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,710
I'm gonna buy that, I'm gonna pay for this too.

1292
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,130
To keep, this is Minecraft now.

1293
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,050
Keep the mobs away.

1294
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,650
Keep the mobs away.

1295
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,310
You need to buy chickens.

1296
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,670
Oh.

1297
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:41,970
You're right.

1298
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,450
Chicken!

1299
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,090
Uh, what was it?

1300
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:48,590
Oh, build.

1301
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,350
Uh, here.

1302
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,850
What was it on here?

1303
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,870
What's, oh, carrying.

1304
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,070
There's even upgrades.

1305
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,970
Move 50% faster while carrying.

1306
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,830
I have $5 only.

1307
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:01,610
Okay, hold on.

1308
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,030
Okay.

1309
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,690
Oh, this is all stuff for the full game.

1310
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,190
Interesting.

1311
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:08,350
Okay.

1312
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,150
Um, how do I buy chickens?

1313
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,710
Are they under build?

1314
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,910
Build chickens.

1315
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:17,350
Oh!

1316
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,090
$5!

1317
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,570
I can only buy one chicken.

1318
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,770
You're the chosen one.

1319
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,690
You're the chosen chicken.

1320
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,330
You!

1321
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,610
You alive?

1322
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,890
Are you good?

1323
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,030
He's alive.

1324
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,310
He's shell-shocked.

1325
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:33,750
He's like, what?

1326
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,850
How did I get here?

1327
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,290
Oh, okay.

1328
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:35,850
He's good now.

1329
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,750
The wolf will love it.

1330
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,290
No!

1331
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,970
Let there be light for you, chicken!

1332
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,010
Okay, I have to manually light these.

1333
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,370
That's good.

1334
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,130
Do they last all night?

1335
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:55,610
Maybe?

1336
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,750
You think?

1337
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,590
Where'd he go?

1338
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:00,430
Chicken!

1339
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,490
Chicken!

1340
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,670
Don't go, don't go too far.

1341
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,550
Don't go to the...

1342
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,950
Oh my gosh, my chicken's gonna leave me.

1343
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,570
My chicken's gonna leave the farm.

1344
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,870
Chicken, no, no, no, no!

1345
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,110
Chicken, don't leave!

1346
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,030
This fence is not...

1347
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,650
This fence is not chicken-proof.

1348
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,850
I think we're...

1349
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,690
No, no, no!

1350
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,290
No!

1351
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,690
He's already trying to leave!

1352
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,470
Chicken, no!

1353
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,390
Chicken!

1354
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,030
Chicken, please!

1355
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,670
Chicken, I just bought you, please!

1356
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,750
Oh, look, there's even like a little stick for like showing how...

1357
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,930
Where's my plot of land?

1358
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,740
There it is.

1359
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,480
Does this light work?

1360
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,400
Why doesn't that work?

1361
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,160
So, we do have light...

1362
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,420
Oh, gosh.

1363
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,020
The crickets.

1364
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,860
The crickets, the crickets, the crickets, the crickets.

1365
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,480
The crickets, the crickets, the crickets.

1366
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,760
What if I stay out, though?

1367
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,610
I don't think I want to find out.

1368
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,030
I'll be honest.

1369
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,930
I think I have 2 chickens.

1370
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,990
I'm more chicken than this chicken, I think.

1371
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,090
Let's check our painting.

1372
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,530
Since the...

1373
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,970
Wait, where's the painting?

1374
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:11,830
Oh here.

1375
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,850
The painting is open!

1376
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,790
The door is open!

1377
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:15,550
The door is open!

1378
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:15,990
The door!

1379
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:16,970
Our house is on fire?

1380
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,090
I keep forgetting to turn off the flashlight.

1381
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:21,730
I'm so sorry.

1382
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,390
The door is open.

1383
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,550
And the door is closed.

1384
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,590
Yeah.

1385
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,730
Is our chicken gonna be okay?

1386
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,430
He's not gonna get eaten though, right?

1387
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:33,950
You don't think?

1388
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,150
You think he's gonna be alright?

1389
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,750
You think our chicken will be okay?

1390
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,490
I'm kinda parasocial for him.

1391
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,190
I think I saw a four-wheeler.

1392
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,630
Oh!

1393
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,850
I did see it!

1394
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,830
It said that I need scrap to fix it.

1395
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,610
Why is it lagging all of a sudden?

1396
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,310
Oh wait.

1397
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,350
I should probably hold this, right?

1398
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:01,770
Destroy the painting.

1399
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:03,990
Eek!

1400
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:04,370
Okay.

1401
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,460
Oh.

1402
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,400
I hear footsteps.

1403
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,580
Do you guys hear that?

1404
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,160
Do you guys hear that?

1405
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,600
What's that?

1406
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,260
What was that?

1407
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,540
What was that?

1408
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,460
I heard footsteps.

1409
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,100
I heard footsteps.

1410
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,640
I heard footsteps.

1411
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,440
Oh!

1412
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,800
It's a little... It's a little like moldy.

1413
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,640
The black mold?

1414
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,080
Okay.

1415
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,780
I think actually our place is not haunted.

1416
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,900
I think we have a lot of black mold.

1417
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,740
And we are ingesting it.

1418
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,320
You know?

1419
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,900
Chickens?

1420
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,680
Chicken.

1421
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,800
Singular chicken.

1422
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,740
Be good out there.

1423
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,640
What is...

1424
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,620
Be good out there, single chicken.

1425
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,880
Be good out there, single chicken.

1426
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,340
Look, the torches help with the mobs.

1427
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:08,700
It's okay.

1428
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:10,840
Maybe.

1429
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,260
Can we sleep?

1430
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,360
I haven't...

1431
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:14,940
Okay.

1432
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,440
There we go.

1433
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:15,840
Ooh!

1434
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,860
Heh heh.

1435
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,240
What was that?

1436
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:23,680
No.

1437
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,660
No!

1438
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,100
I guess I'll take a quick look outside.

1439
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,600
Oh!

1440
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,060
No, no, no, no, no.

1441
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,670
I don't like that.

1442
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,350
What was that sound?

1443
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,470
Where do I go look at the sound?

1444
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:13,770
Oh, no.

1445
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,010
Hmm.

1446
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,130
Hmm.

1447
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,730
What does that mean?

1448
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,490
Can't I just check from the window?

1449
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,550
Can't I just be like...

1450
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:46,310
Yep.

1451
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,010
Nothing there.

1452
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,220
Oh, gosh.

1453
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,620
That doesn't look so dark out.

1454
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,880
Maybe we're okay.

1455
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,480
My tomatoes are grown.

1456
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,920
Okay, guys.

1457
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
I think this was a mistake.

1458
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,880
This game is so spooky.

1459
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,220
Actually.

1460
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:12,900
Okay.

1461
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,640
I did...

1462
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,040
I'll be honest.

1463
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,060
I did turn the gamma up.

1464
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,520
Because, um...

1465
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,780
That...

1466
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:20,740
Oh.

1467
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,880
Okay.

1468
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,440
That sounds like a wild animal.

1469
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,180
Right?

1470
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,190
Oh, there...

1471
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,250
There's a bird!

1472
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,590
It's this bird!

1473
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,570
Oh.

1474
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,390
Turn that on.

1475
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:42,850
And...

1476
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,000
Oh, that light is on.

1477
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,380
Okay.

1478
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,640
Okay.

1479
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,080
Good to know.

1480
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,760
Okay.

1481
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,580
Okay.

1482
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,960
It's a bird!

1483
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,280
Oh, my God.

1484
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,280
That's it!

1485
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,600
Okay.

1486
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,840
Go inside.

1487
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,440
Go inside.

1488
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,740
Go inside.

1489
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,020
Go inside.

1490
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,380
Go inside.

1491
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:02,560
Go inside.

1492
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,940
Come on, Garrett.

1493
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,700
Get a grip.

1494
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:04,960
Yeah.

1495
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,380
Get...

1496
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,540
The lonely nights can destroy you.

1497
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,780
Nighttime in the forest...

1498
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,500
Oh, gosh.

1499
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,420
Can be...

1500
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,920
Nothing here.

1501
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,620
Can be especially dangerous.

1502
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,840
You can avoid the night by finishing your to-do list and going to bed early.

1503
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,580
You can also...

1504
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,140
You can also clean your home and grow your farm.

1505
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,420
The greater your farmstead grows, the more protected you will be from dangerous hauntings.

1506
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,480
Inside.

1507
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,540
Inside.

1508
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:29,980
Inside.

1509
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,720
You're a grown-ass adult, Garrett.

1510
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,080
Yup.

1511
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,460
There's no one out here.

1512
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,200
Go and look around if you're so scared.

1513
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,000
You, baby.

1514
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,680
Oh!

1515
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,900
Don't say that, please.

1516
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,730
Is that my house?

1517
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,130
Who's filming this?

1518
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:55,930
You, voyeur?

1519
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,130
What?

1520
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,550
Oh, I can't turn it off?

1521
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,690
Um...

1522
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:03,970
Okay.

1523
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:08,530
Beep, beep.

1524
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,170
Yeah, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1525
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,150
I'm just...

1526
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,470
Just collapses into the bed.

1527
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:14,950
There was a...

1528
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:15,510
Wait, there was a face?

1529
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,710
A face in the corner?

1530
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,270
Wait, what do you mean?

1531
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,930
Hmm?

1532
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,470
Hmm?

1533
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:21,750
Hmm?

1534
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:22,190
Hmm?

1535
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,730
Are you talking about me?

1536
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,290
I don't feel as alone as I used to.

1537
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,250
I wish that wasn't the case.

1538
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,010
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1539
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,250
I don't think that's a good thing, man.

1540
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,210
I don't think it's a good thing that we don't feel very alone in our haunted house, okay?

1541
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:37,690
Just saying.

1542
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,250
Everything's fine.

1543
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,850
I don't know why I feel so much more comfortable with the back door.

1544
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:43,750
Oh, what's our to-do list?

1545
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,430
Buy a better axe, explore the inside of the barn.

1546
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,050
Oh, out there?

1547
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,130
Gosh.

1548
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,630
Good morning, Minto!

1549
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,960
Check for eggs.

1550
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:05,580
Yeah.

1551
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,680
We got our tomatoes from earlier.

1552
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,860
And eggies of our single...

1553
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,420
Look at him go inside!

1554
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,960
Oh my gosh!

1555
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,860
You've been a busy plant!

1556
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,660
Whoa.

1557
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,200
Okay.

1558
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,060
Single chicken.

1559
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:24,780
Okay.

1560
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,840
All right.

1561
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,260
And you're pooping out some more?

1562
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,900
Okay, chicken!

1563
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,460
Okay, chicken!

1564
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,600
Never mind.

1565
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,320
False alarm.

1566
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,100
Okay.

1567
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,840
Let's go, chicken.

1568
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,400
Let's go!

1569
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,720
Two bucks!

1570
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,400
And the music is over.

1571
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,260
Oh, never mind.

1572
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,800
All right.

1573
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,380
All right.

1574
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,740
All right.

1575
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,740
Like I said, I think we should plant some more tomatoes, right?

1576
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,620
Actually, let's get some more chickens.

1577
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,620
Do eggs hatch?

1578
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,880
Well, I only have...

1579
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,700
one chicken.

1580
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,460
$5 for that many!

1581
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,520
Like...

1582
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,640
We have $8.30 So...

1583
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,880
The axe level 2 is $15.

1584
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,720
Ow!

1585
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,580
What if...

1586
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,500
If I don't get enough?

1587
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,080
Okay.

1588
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,460
If I don't get enough, we're gonna...

1589
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,180
We're gonna...

1590
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,580
Not gonna be able to go anywhere else.

1591
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,180
Oh gosh.

1592
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:28,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1593
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,280
Start cutting!

1594
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:30,880
Start cutting!

1595
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,000
We need $0.50!

1596
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,080
$0.50!

1597
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,720
And we won't be able to go to bed!

1598
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,440
It says complete your to-do list.

1599
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,900
Like, remember how it said, like, You didn't complete your to-do list.

1600
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,960
Oh, you're gonna get in trouble.

1601
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,380
What's this sound?

1602
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,720
Why is it so foggy today?

1603
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,240
Where's our beautiful...

1604
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,540
Why is it so foggy today?

1605
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,000
I don't like this.

1606
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,640
Oh, to water.

1607
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,060
Thank you.

1608
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,910
Yeah.

1609
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,370
So we can get more tomatoes.

1610
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,490
Yeah.

1611
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,650
Gimme dollar, gimme dollar.

1612
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:12,970
Gimme dollar, gimme dollar.

1613
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:16,830
Wow.

1614
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:18,450
This is really how it would be, huh?

1615
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,170
Just out here on the...

1616
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,690
Little splash for you.

1617
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,850
Splash for you.

1618
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,990
I'm really...

1619
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,110
I can't believe that works.

1620
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:38,550
I was saying earlier though, I watched a little bit of some people playing.

1621
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,270
That's why, like, I knew that...

1622
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:40,730
Oh my gosh!

1623
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,130
That's why I knew about the game and everything.

1624
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:48,030
But their game was very dark, so I turned it up.

1625
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,990
So that it would be easier, you know?

1626
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:53,650
To see and stuff.

1627
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,390
Okay!

1628
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:56,950
$0.80!

1629
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:57,910
Let's go!

1630
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,690
Oh my gosh!

1631
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,910
Where'd you come from, little guy?

1632
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,910
I think I have a food bowl on the porch for you.

1633
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,950
Oh, Michael!

1634
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:09,750
Kitty visitor!

1635
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:10,710
Kitty visitor!

1636
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,750
Kitty visitor!

1637
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,970
Wait, is that...

1638
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,730
This one, right?

1639
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:23,270
This one, right?

1640
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,270
Kitty!

1641
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,430
He's so cute!

1642
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,150
Kitty!

1643
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:28,810
He's so cute!

1644
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,770
Oh gosh, I'm gonna cry.

1645
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,310
I miss my cat so much.

1646
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,810
How much do we have?

1647
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:35,610
Fourteen!

1648
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,870
We're so close, actually.

1649
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:39,290
Fifteen.

1650
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,710
Okay, we need a dollar more, guys.

1651
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,370
A dollar more.

1652
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,630
We just gotta cut down one more tree.

1653
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,540
Please let nothing bad happen.

1654
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:51,980
Please let nothing bad happen.

1655
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,480
Dev, if you're listening...

1656
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,120
If you're listening, Dev...

1657
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,620
There's rocks, too!

1658
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,860
Don't let anything happen to the cat, please.

1659
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,240
Don't let anything happen to the cat, please.

1660
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,420
I wanna get more.

1661
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,240
I wanna get more...

1662
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,900
More chickens.

1663
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,100
Cuz that chicken...

1664
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,320
laid a lot of eggs, you know?

1665
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,480
Look at him go!

1666
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,380
You can see him walking around over there!

1667
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:21,900
So cute!

1668
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:22,600
Yay!

1669
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,040
We can buy a new axe!

1670
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,020
Yay!

1671
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,020
We can buy a new axe!

1672
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,800
And now...

1673
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,560
Okay.

1674
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,660
I think I'm ready to venture out beyond the fence now.

1675
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,500
I think I'm ready to venture out beyond the fence now.

1676
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,240
Let's see what's out there.

1677
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,300
Do I just break it?

1678
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,720
Oh, you can break wooden fences with your new axe!

1679
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,020
Oh, um...

1680
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,900
We didn't need this fence anyway!

1681
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:42,940
Okay!

1682
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,080
Wow, it's really cloudy.

1683
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,480
I'm kinda scared, though.

1684
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,080
This place looks creepy.

1685
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,100
Is there...

1686
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,180
Okay.

1687
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,600
Let's not...

1688
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,320
Let's not...

1689
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:03,420
Ooh!

1690
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,240
Yeah!

1691
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,240
Wow, this is incredible!

1692
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,080
This'll be perfect for cattle.

1693
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:11,860
For cattle?

1694
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,080
Ooh!

1695
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:12,900
I got metal!

1696
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,340
Wow, this looks like pure zinc.

1697
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,080
I read that an old factory is nearby.

1698
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,340
I read that an old factory is nearby.

1699
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:18,840
Is that it?

1700
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,240
That over there must be the old factory, right?

1701
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,960
Oh, I was about to say, what is that?

1702
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,880
But it's the chicken coop.

1703
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,580
It's like glowing in the distance.

1704
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:29,540
It's so brown.

1705
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,540
Is it...

1706
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,540
I can't tell if it's getting night time or not, you know?

1707
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,400
All my stamina.

1708
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,460
Zinc.

1709
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,320
Let's sell this.

1710
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:43,780
$30!

1711
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,080
Why are we cutting down wood for pennies?

1712
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,540
When I can just go and take apart a whole building and sell it for...

1713
01:05:59,160 --> 01:05:59,600
What?

1714
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,140
$30!

1715
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,220
Yeah, we can get more chickens!

1716
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,480
Let's buy more chickens, let's buy more chickens.

1717
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,500
Oh, wait.

1718
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,700
It's under...

1719
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,800
It's under here, right?

1720
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,300
Livestock.

1721
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,160
Chicken.

1722
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,460
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1723
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,680
Chicken, chicken.

1724
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,180
Okay, everybody!

1725
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,120
Sounds like we had a great productive day.

1726
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,280
I hear the crickets and it's time for me to skedaddle...

1727
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,140
Our painting is fine, though.

1728
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,500
I'm just gonna start stripping the electrical system for copper.

1729
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,100
When are we gonna clean our house?

1730
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,300
Doesn't feel very homey right now.

1731
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,080
Look at them wandering.

1732
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,580
Okay, don't go outside the fence.

1733
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,080
Oh, shoot.

1734
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,520
Maybe I should have rebuilt my fence.

1735
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,620
Wait, we can build, right?

1736
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,860
Maybe I should have rebuilt...

1737
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:56,960
Oh, we can build a gate!

1738
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,320
Okay, we're gonna build a gate.

1739
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,420
Tomorrow.

1740
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,580
We'll build a gate tomorrow.

1741
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,080
Let's do any...

1742
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,460
Let's go to sleep before anything scary happens, right?

1743
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,840
There we go.

1744
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,400
Prevent the evil.

1745
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,980
Chapter complete!

1746
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,800
New shop items unlocked!

1747
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,080
Let's go.

1748
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,900
I'm sure the chickens stayed.

1749
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,760
What the hell do I do now?

1750
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,600
What do you mean?

1751
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:34,500
Oh.

1752
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,220
To progress the story, go to the shop and buy an item marked with an asterisk.

1753
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:43,960
It will start a sequence of important events and tasks which will lead to revelations about Garrett's past and future.

1754
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,840
Yeah, the rifle, the rifle.

1755
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,940
Completing chapters will also unlock new items in the shop.

1756
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,260
Okay.

1757
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,820
What do I do now?

1758
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:55,900
I don't know.

1759
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,860
You chose to live here.

1760
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,380
I wonder if I can buy that rifle yet.

1761
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,840
Buddy, it was a...

1762
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,760
I just was able to buy chickens.

1763
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,220
Please.

1764
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,780
Give me a moment's break, okay?

1765
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,340
Oh!

1766
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,760
Pick up and sell all the trash!

1767
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,460
Okay.

1768
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:15,620
Finally!

1769
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,200
Okay.

1770
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,560
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1771
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,260
A clean home.

1772
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,020
A nice chicken start.

1773
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,080
Chickens...

1774
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,880
Chickens are all still here.

1775
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:28,960
We have three of them.

1776
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,680
We should have three chickens, everybody.

1777
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,500
Let's do a head count.

1778
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,840
Only 25 cents?

1779
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,560
Come on, man.

1780
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,140
Okay.

1781
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:40,980
Chicken one!

1782
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,830
Do I... Do they need this clothes to...

1783
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,790
Chicken two!

1784
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,430
Do they feel embarrassed with this open, you think?

1785
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,710
Chicken three?

1786
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,270
Is that all of them?

1787
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,070
Yup.

1788
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,310
That's all of them.

1789
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,170
All of our chickens are accounted for.

1790
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,910
The whole family.

1791
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,090
A dollar sixty.

1792
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:10,710
Alright.

1793
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,170
How much do we have?

1794
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,450
Forty-four dollars?

1795
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:14,910
Oh, hello, hello!

1796
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,930
New items have been unlocked.

1797
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,670
Oh, a grass hook.

1798
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:26,770
Stamina.

1799
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:26,950
Oh!

1800
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:27,990
Okay.

1801
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,150
We should buy...

1802
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:29,990
We should buy these, right?

1803
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,910
Our carrying speed would be good, because we...

1804
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:37,390
Completely remove slowdown!

1805
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,530
Why not?

1806
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:39,970
Right?

1807
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:41,290
Running speed...

1808
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,890
Twenty percent.

1809
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,170
Stamina by twenty percent.

1810
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,550
Increased carrying load by ten percent!

1811
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,130
Throwing power?

1812
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,450
Increased throwing power for carried... Wait, really?

1813
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:56,630
Some of these are still locked for the full game.

1814
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,790
Oh!

1815
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,850
The rifle is a hundred dollars!

1816
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:04,690
Okay.

1817
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,090
Um...

1818
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,230
Okay.

1819
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,530
I think we need to, uh...

1820
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:09,850
Save up.

1821
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,930
Okay, we need to plant some more tomatoes, maybe.

1822
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:15,990
Okay, okay.

1823
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,570
And buy some more chickens, I think.

1824
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:20,110
Feed the cat?

1825
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,110
Okay, I'll feed the cat.

1826
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,530
Let's go feed our baby.

1827
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,070
Little baby.

1828
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,490
Okay.

1829
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,890
Tonight, guys, I'm gonna stay outside.

1830
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:38,570
Tonight, we're going to push the boundaries of staying outdoors in the night.

1831
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:44,680
Oh, nice!

1832
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,040
I'm kind of scared, though.

1833
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,580
Not kind of, I'm actually gonna be a lot of... Nice, nice, nice.

1834
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,660
I'm gonna be a lot of scared.

1835
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,340
Holy moly!

1836
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:57,880
Oh my god.

1837
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,400
Eggs.

1838
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,100
Egg city.

1839
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,340
Leave your eyes.

1840
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,160
Ten million chicken flies.

1841
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,220
There was, like, that grass hook?

1842
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,580
I wonder if that will, um, work for, like, this stuff, you know?

1843
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,320
It's ten dollars, though.

1844
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,860
Oh, it's water?

1845
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,240
Water and cans?

1846
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,120
Oh, gosh.

1847
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,140
I never have had to refill this thing.

1848
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,040
You're probably supposed to water them properly, and here I am, like, giving them little...

1849
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,280
They're working, though!

1850
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:40,780
It's working!

1851
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:43,900
Oh, wait.

1852
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:44,780
Axe level two.

1853
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,800
Does it work on this?

1854
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:47,940
No.

1855
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:00,080
Yeah, it does have a meter, but I think because I'm just getting absolute droplets, it just doesn't matter.

1856
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:05,600
Wait.

1857
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,960
Our pennies, our pennies, our pennies.

1858
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,980
Watch out, cat!

1859
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,800
I love this guy.

1860
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,040
Oh, he's so cute!

1861
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,280
Did you see?

1862
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,280
He just went up, he just, like, he just, like, brushed against my leg!

1863
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,040
That was so cute!

1864
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,320
Okay, what's my other to-dos?

1865
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,520
Oh, the trash.

1866
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,780
And break up three tree stumps.

1867
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,060
Okay, we're selling the logs, so we've been doing that.

1868
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,240
Oh, okay.

1869
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,930
Wait, but don't we want these to, like, regrow?

1870
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,130
We're gonna run out of trees at some point, right?

1871
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:50,890
Can't we cut down those trees?

1872
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,690
And we're just gonna deforest the whole landscape?

1873
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:54,570
That's okay.

1874
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,210
We don't need a...

1875
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,870
We don't need a forest.

1876
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:01,570
Oh, this takes stamina, I just realized.

1877
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:02,550
Okay.

1878
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,010
Good to know.

1879
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,200
We don't need a forest!

1880
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,780
So maybe I should buy more stamina stuff, right?

1881
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:19,500
Huh...

1882
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,360
Okay, let's pick up and sell the trash.

1883
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,620
Since there's a lot of this.

1884
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,480
Pick up...

1885
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,040
Trash!

1886
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,480
Trash!

1887
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,420
Trash!

1888
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:29,960
Trash!

1889
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,180
Ew!

1890
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,820
This is, like, my own- That can't be from, like, earlier.

1891
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,320
Like, that's my own trash.

1892
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,800
I'm just throwing my own bottles of beans on the ground.

1893
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:41,810
Holy moly.

1894
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:42,130
Okay.

1895
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,110
Clean, clean, clean!

1896
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,860
I like the...

1897
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:58,040
You know, I like- The spooky aspect's fine.

1898
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,160
Our painting is fine.

1899
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:00,800
But, um...

1900
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,120
Just, like, kind of the maintenance is also so great, you know?

1901
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,580
I don't like having more than one door open.

1902
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,460
This is very paranoid of me, but- Wait, the sun is already starting to go down!

1903
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,360
Oh no no no no no no!

1904
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,020
No no no no no!

1905
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,400
Will it let me sleep?

1906
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,030
Okay.

1907
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:27,030
Maybe that- What was that?

1908
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,020
Um...

1909
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,380
Our painting is a little woozy.

1910
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,760
Just means we need to put on our glasses, that's all.

1911
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,580
That's all.

1912
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,020
Danger is coming.

1913
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,600
But what kind of danger?

1914
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,520
What does woozy painting mean?

1915
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,120
Wait, I'm 97% done with the trash!

1916
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,160
Where's the rest- Where's the rest of the trash?

1917
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,360
Our painting is... getting woozier?

1918
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,920
Where's the rest of the trash?

1919
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:08,900
Fireplace?

1920
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,540
Oh, oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1921
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,800
Okay, let's go do it.

1922
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,230
Let's go sell it.

1923
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:19,650
Okay.

1924
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:20,530
Run, run, run, run.

1925
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:21,450
Run, run, run, run.

1926
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:21,910
Okay.

1927
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:22,610
You know what?

1928
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:23,690
I said I was gonna stay outside.

1929
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:24,370
I changed my mind.

1930
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,990
I changed my mind!

1931
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,470
As soon as the painting starts acting up, I start acting up!

1932
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,540
But I wanna know what's out there.

1933
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,940
Check the toilet...

1934
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,020
It's fine!

1935
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,360
Look at all this mold!

1936
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,360
It's not us, it's the- Wait, it's- Is it upside down?

1937
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,460
Or am I crazy?

1938
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,500
Oh yeah, the painting is upside down now.

1939
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,960
Oh, the fence gate!

1940
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,020
My chickens!

1941
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,000
You think they'll be okay?

1942
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,420
Another day?

1943
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,840
Oh no!

1944
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:27,670
Oh, you can't see, but that noise is like a little bed symbol in the top right.

1945
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,590
It's telling me to go to bed.

1946
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:36,370
It's allowing me though, even though I didn't complete my to-do list.

1947
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:38,450
I guess we're okay.

1948
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,530
Is there anything else in my diary?

1949
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,210
Oh gosh.

1950
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:44,870
The chickens will be fine.

1951
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,650
There's gonna be something on my ceiling, I swear.

1952
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:50,090
Day 6?

1953
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,930
There's gonna be something on the ceiling, you guys, I swear.

1954
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,390
But what's out there?

1955
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,030
I have to be brave at some point.

1956
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:06,810
Maybe when I get closer to the end of me being able to play, right?

1957
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,310
Okay, painting is fine!

1958
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:14,550
Our house is clean, besides all the black mold that's investing my brain.

1959
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,850
So far so good though, everything else is fine.

1960
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,370
The light turns off and it scares me every time.

1961
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,190
Look how beautiful it is!

1962
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:26,950
Oh my gosh, chickens!

1963
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:29,290
Don't make that noise, it scares me.

1964
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,390
So far we've just had a spooky person in our house.

1965
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:38,450
Whatever.

1966
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,230
What else is in the barn, I wonder?

1967
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,310
Okay, hold on.

1968
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,910
We're gonna build this gate.

1969
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,510
Oh.

1970
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,400
Never mind.

1971
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,480
Sell 12 logs.

1972
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,680
But what if I went and explored Oh my yuck!

1973
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,440
Six of the chickens!

1974
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,100
We have the whole world now!

1975
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,360
Like over here.

1976
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,440
Oh, remember our map!

1977
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,340
We have the map!

1978
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,360
The map, the map, the map!

1979
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,180
The sunrise is so nice.

1980
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:20,780
I know, right?

1981
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,840
I love when it's sunny.

1982
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,260
And not ghostly.

1983
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,280
Look, now we're just fire.

1984
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,320
We're just watch the fire watch now.

1985
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,640
Does all of this here land?

1986
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,480
I'm not sure.

1987
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,120
Okay.

1988
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,520
Here we go!

1989
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:43,820
Oh!

1990
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,980
New location discovered!

1991
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,800
We are at...

1992
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,420
C2!

1993
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,350
This doesn't look...

1994
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:00,550
Actually, this looks quite modern, all things considered.

1995
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,640
That fence looks extremely modern.

1996
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,100
Why is our place such a dump?

1997
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,280
All of this looks really modern.

1998
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,520
Come on fat ass, you can do this.

1999
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,300
Pog cameo!

2000
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,480
Oh my god, C2!

2001
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,760
I got a map of the area!

2002
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,540
Our home, and the farm, and...

2003
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,660
Everything else...

2004
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,860
Is that all that's up here?

2005
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:41,620
Really?

2006
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,860
What is that over there?

2007
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,420
Maybe for the full game?

2008
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,620
And this is...

2009
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:51,240
All items found!

2010
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:52,720
Wow!

2011
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:54,180
Wow!

2012
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,240
What's that crunchy sound?

2013
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,300
Oh, the factory?

2014
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,740
I think I can drop.

2015
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,180
So I don't have to go all the way back down.

2016
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,240
La la la la.

2017
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,960
La la la la.

2018
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,200
Okay.

2019
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,800
Okay, okay, okay.

2020
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,040
Oh.

2021
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,000
Let's check out this fence real quick.

2022
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,980
This looks like government facility.

2023
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,580
Do not enter.

2024
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,700
Secrets are being held here.

2025
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:38,360
Oh.

2026
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,160
Oh, we are being tested.

2027
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,320
Guys, it's not haunting!

2028
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,260
It's a government mind control trick.

2029
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:47,600
Obviously.

2030
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:48,500
Oh.

2031
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:53,340
Yeah.

2032
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,080
Let's get my axe back out.

2033
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,380
I feel safer with this.

2034
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,840
It's a government mind control trick.

2035
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,720
We didn't explore everything in the barn, so...

2036
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,240
Maybe there's some other stuff we can check out over here.

2037
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,730
He said it was for cattle.

2038
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,650
So maybe eventually we can get cows.

2039
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,120
Sorry, I thought I heard something.

2040
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,700
Like footsteps or something.

2041
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,320
I want to see...

2042
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:40,420
This game probably looks so much better with all the graphics at high.

2043
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,280
Oh, climb?

2044
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:43,800
Oh!

2045
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,780
There we go!

2046
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,540
Here I go.

2047
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,060
What a thrill!

2048
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,580
Cow-kini.

2049
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:56,500
No!

2050
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,000
Any more zinc?

2051
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:07,400
Any more super expensive pieces of things to sell?

2052
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,140
Wait.

2053
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,780
Ammo!

2054
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,680
More!

2055
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,320
More ammo.

2056
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,520
I'll take it.

2057
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,360
Wait, what's up here?

2058
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,120
I see something blue.

2059
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,800
With darkness and silence in the night.

2060
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,840
What is this?

2061
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,600
An oil can.

2062
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,260
Minto, do you smell anything?

2063
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:28,860
Gas.

2064
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,540
No, good.

2065
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,000
That's good.

2066
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,320
No, I think...

2067
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:35,360
I smell that fresh, fresh air.

2068
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,580
That fresh, fresh air.

2069
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,180
These are rare items?

2070
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:47,120
These rare items are not only used to buy the best items in the catalog shop, but are also required to complete the game!

2071
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,960
Wait, you're making a rare item?

2072
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,700
Keep an eye out for them as you explore.

2073
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,320
You're making a rare item?

2074
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,160
Something that you have to complete the game?

2075
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:58,540
Okay.

2076
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,360
Shit.

2077
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,100
Shit?

2078
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:05,540
What do you mean?

2079
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,080
It's a puppy!

2080
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:09,300
Wait, uh oh.

2081
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,420
Is puppy not friendly?

2082
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:12,540
Uh oh.

2083
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,060
Oh, I think I'm surrounded.

2084
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,780
Uh oh.

2085
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,300
Uh oh.

2086
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,300
Puppy is growling.

2087
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:28,600
Puppy?

2088
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:31,200
Puppy?

2089
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,940
Where is puppy?

2090
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,140
Puppy?

2091
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:35,720
Puppy?

2092
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,640
Um, where is puppy?

2093
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,360
Puppy is gonna go after my chickens.

2094
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:42,720
Oh!

2095
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,200
Oh!

2096
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,720
Are you sure the cat was friendly?

2097
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:46,940
Oh, there's two of them.

2098
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:47,580
Oh shoot.

2099
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,080
Oh god.

2100
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:49,620
Um...

2101
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:51,660
Uh...

2102
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,040
Maybe we can jump and make a run for it.

2103
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,440
Oh no, they're fast.

2104
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,540
Oh my god, they're really fast.

2105
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,240
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

2106
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,760
Wait, the sun is going down, you guys.

2107
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,120
Uh oh, uh oh.

2108
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:05,600
We gotta go.

2109
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,960
We gotta go, we gotta go, go, go.

2110
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:09,740
Oh, oh god.

2111
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,120
Oh god.

2112
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:11,360
Ah!

2113
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:13,300
They're camping!

2114
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:16,760
Okay.

2115
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,060
I'm sorry, dogs.

2116
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,080
I'm sorry.

2117
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:19,700
I'm sorry!

2118
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,320
I'm sorry!

2119
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:20,980
Oh my gosh.

2120
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:21,320
Ah!

2121
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,160
Ah!

2122
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:22,720
Ah!

2123
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,280
Ah!

2124
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,040
Ah!

2125
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,660
Ah!

2126
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,850
I'm sorry!

2127
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:31,770
I'm sorry!

2128
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,170
I'm sorry!

2129
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:36,730
I'm sorry!

2130
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:37,630
I'm sorry!

2131
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,090
I'm sorry!

2132
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,810
You guys, the crickets!

2133
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:43,330
The crickets!

2134
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,310
We're gonna go over there tomorrow.

2135
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,800
Will it still let me sleep?

2136
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,960
How's my painting looking?

2137
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,200
Oh!

2138
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,280
It's a tree!

2139
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,160
I

2140
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,600
hate nature.

2141
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,200
Oh, my bad.

2142
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,440
Not my house.

2143
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,860
I'm destroying my house.

2144
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,780
Do we still got them beans?

2145
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:25,900
Oh yeah.

2146
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,160
Um...

2147
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,720
Oh no, we're gonna be haunted by the dogs.

2148
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:34,780
Whoa.

2149
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,880
It's so bright.

2150
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,740
Why is it so bright?

2151
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,160
Is it a full moon?

2152
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:43,760
Whoa.

2153
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:45,660
Okay.

2154
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,360
That was nice.

2155
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:47,360
Close the door.

2156
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,020
No food for the cat!

2157
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:54,600
No food for the cat!

2158
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,640
It was right here, right?

2159
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,060
It was right here, right?

2160
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,700
We can feed the cat.

2161
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:00,140
We can feed the cat.

2162
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,460
Oh, I didn't water my...

2163
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,320
You guys, I didn't water my...

2164
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,500
Oh my gosh.

2165
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,520
It's a woozy tree.

2166
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:19,750
That's the cat!

2167
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:21,270
Food for you!

2168
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,070
Goodnight, cat!

2169
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,090
You wanna come inside?

2170
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,090
You wanna come in?

2171
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:29,870
You wanna like...

2172
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:32,090
Not be out here?

2173
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,990
Cat?

2174
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:36,920
Come here!

2175
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,500
Come on, cat!

2176
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,800
There's food over here!

2177
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,940
I'll just put the food inside.

2178
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:44,140
The tomatoes?

2179
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,660
Screw the tomatoes.

2180
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,820
I hate tomatoes.

2181
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,540
Guess we're good.

2182
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,740
Oh my god, every time we lay down, it scares me.

2183
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,440
The cat doesn't like mold.

2184
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,500
Who wouldn't?

2185
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,680
It's just extra flavor.

2186
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,440
Okay.

2187
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,440
Alright.

2188
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:15,780
Another day.

2189
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,400
Painting is okay.

2190
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:20,240
Painting is okay.

2191
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,380
Alright.

2192
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,480
When I get closer to...

2193
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,140
Oh my little baby.

2194
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,960
Yeah, there you go.

2195
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,240
I won't forget this time.

2196
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,080
There you go!

2197
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:36,920
There you go!

2198
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,300
That's not where the bowl is.

2199
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,920
He's just standing in it.

2200
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,520
He's just standing in it.

2201
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,240
You stand wherever you want, little cat.

2202
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,820
Real cat behavior.

2203
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,580
We still have tomatoes!

2204
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,120
Even though I didn't water them?

2205
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:07,860
Or did I?

2206
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,620
Am I crazy?

2207
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,820
Actually, I am.

2208
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,340
I'm being poisoned by the government and by my house.

2209
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,980
I think the lagging is...

2210
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,600
um...

2211
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,400
Is it because I'm on my laptop?

2212
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,880
Because it does lag sometimes, but...

2213
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,840
I think it's because I'm on my laptop.

2214
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:28,820
You know?

2215
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,280
Any dogs wanting to come over here?

2216
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,000
Any dogs?

2217
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,440
Okay, what's on our to-do list?

2218
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,020
Oh, we still gotta sell those logs!

2219
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:41,560
Wait, we can actually get this one now, though.

2220
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:46,550
Good luck, Laptop-kun.

2221
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:48,850
Oh, and let's get our eggs.

2222
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,690
Let's get our eggs.

2223
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:50,870
Eggs and logs.

2224
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:52,030
Eggs and logs, everybody.

2225
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,130
We're a farmer.

2226
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:58,450
We ain't got time for no paranormal business.

2227
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,830
Holy moly!

2228
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:02,250
Okay.

2229
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:04,790
The chickens have been really busy.

2230
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,050
Oh my gosh.

2231
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:09,310
Holy cow.

2232
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:14,790
Eight dollars!

2233
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:15,310
Let's go!

2234
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,490
But he's laying another egg!

2235
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,110
They're insane!

2236
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:25,990
They're insatiable!

2237
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,320
Am I getting all of them?

2238
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,180
I can't tell.

2239
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,260
Oh my gosh.

2240
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,960
So many!

2241
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,560
This is just three chickens.

2242
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,700
Seven dollars!

2243
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:44,480
How much do we have?

2244
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,040
We can buy the rifle!

2245
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,080
You guys, we can buy the rifle.

2246
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,580
But that probably means like the real scary starts happening, isn't it?

2247
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,540
Because it's a story thing.

2248
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,220
What else?

2249
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,200
We got our meds.

2250
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,380
Aw.

2251
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,800
Rifle ends the demo, I think.

2252
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,580
Okay, we don't wanna get it quite yet then, right?

2253
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,840
We wanna...

2254
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,560
I wanna test out some of the other stuff too first.

2255
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,380
A little bit.

2256
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,420
I wanna test out some of the other stuff a little bit.

2257
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,600
I wanna see more spooky.

2258
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,460
I wanna see more spooky.

2259
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,460
Our cat is so cute!

2260
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,010
Okay.

2261
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:35,030
Don't roll, don't roll, don't roll, don't roll.

2262
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:36,610
Don't roll, don't roll, don't roll!

2263
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:47,660
Stop!

2264
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,300
Stop moving!

2265
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,580
Oh my gosh, please.

2266
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:50,520
Okay.

2267
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,920
Logs are making a break for it.

2268
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,520
We're making good money.

2269
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,640
We're making good money.

2270
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,060
We're making money, honey.

2271
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:02,560
We're making money, honey.

2272
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,200
What's out in this way too?

2273
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,380
Oh, there's another fence!

2274
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:11,980
I did say today we were gonna go over to that place.

2275
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,020
I did say today we were gonna go over to that place.

2276
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:13,120
I did say today we were gonna go over to that place.

2277
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,760
Well, I finished our to-do list.

2278
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,540
We could go to sleep.

2279
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,680
I think there's more dogs.

2280
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:29,880
Dogs!

2281
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,380
Let's not go over there.

2282
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:38,280
Let's go this way.

2283
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,660
To the infirmary.

2284
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,260
To the infirmary.

2285
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:43,820
I'm assuming.

2286
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,160
There's another watchtower down there!

2287
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:46,900
There's another watchtower down there!

2288
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,880
Well, you know what I probably should've done is bought more stamina.

2289
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,060
Probably.

2290
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,100
Take a swim?

2291
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,540
I can't.

2292
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,400
It won't let me.

2293
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:05,580
Bloodlake.

2294
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,560
Yeah, it's pretty nasty.

2295
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:06,960
Bloodlake.

2296
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:06,960
Yeah, it's pretty nasty.

2297
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,800
It's probably all rust from the factory.

2298
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,000
And we're drinking this water!

2299
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,420
You guys, we're totally poisoned.

2300
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,200
We're just absolutely poisoned.

2301
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:17,720
Three.

2302
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:23,410
I don't think it's working.

2303
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,140
Wait.

2304
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,280
That's not... We don't have a lot of time.

2305
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,080
Go, go, go.

2306
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,100
Man, what is your story, old building?

2307
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:39,060
Where's your loot, old building?

2308
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:41,700
What was that?

2309
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:42,620
Never mind.

2310
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,480
I don't want to be in here.

2311
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,020
Just kidding.

2312
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:44,500
I'm leaving.

2313
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,400
Okay.

2314
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,180
I'm brave.

2315
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:56,520
I'm brave.

2316
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:56,860
I'm brave.

2317
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,220
I'm brave.

2318
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:57,560
I'm brave.

2319
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,380
I'm brave.

2320
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:02,920
I'm brave.

2321
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:03,300
I'm brave.

2322
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,680
I'm brave.

2323
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:04,000
I'm brave.

2324
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:04,760
I'm brave.

2325
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,140
I'm brave.

2326
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:05,280
I'm brave.

2327
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:05,280
I'm brave.

2328
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,100
So, wait.

2329
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,440
Oh, there's stuff in here.

2330
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:10,640
Take it.

2331
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,040
Go.

2332
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:11,620
Oh, wait.

2333
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,240
There's a... No, I didn't mean to drop it!

2334
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,740
But this stuff's too...

2335
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,440
This stuff too.

2336
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:17,380
Okay.

2337
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,680
Take it and leave.

2338
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,260
Get out of here.

2339
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,720
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

2340
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:31,090
Sun's going down.

2341
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,910
It goes down fast.

2342
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:37,830
Hello, brave.

2343
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:38,390
Hi, Minto.

2344
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:42,150
I can only be one or the other.

2345
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,370
This is a part for the bike.

2346
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:48,250
Okay.

2347
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:48,250
I got this.

2348
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,130
Oh, it did say if we have the... Oh, I sold the first one though.

2349
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:54,290
Maybe the cat is part of your imagination?

2350
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:56,010
No, that cat is real!

2351
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,630
It will vanish when you take your meds.

2352
01:33:58,670 --> 01:33:58,770
No!

2353
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:01,010
Oh my god, crickets, crickets, you guys.

2354
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:01,330
Crickets.

2355
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,890
I did water.

2356
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,750
Right...

2357
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:13,870
Okay.

2358
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:14,890
We're ready to escape.

2359
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,380
What's that sound?

2360
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,340
It's gonna sound like someone's sniffing me.

2361
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,240
My cat's eating.

2362
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,020
My cat is growing healthy and strong.

2363
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,520
All good.

2364
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,700
It's not like letting me interact with it, so I think it's a sellable.

2365
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,520
It's only sellable.

2366
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:42,060
Sniffle?

2367
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:42,740
Oh my gosh.

2368
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:44,180
It's getting dark fast, you guys.

2369
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,100
It's getting dark fast.

2370
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,780
Chickens, go to sleep.

2371
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,760
Don't get eaten.

2372
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:49,820
Be good chickens.

2373
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:52,940
Throw!

2374
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:53,340
Yeah.

2375
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,860
How much money did I make?

2376
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:55,620
Oh my god.

2377
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,040
Oh my god.

2378
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,620
Get inside.

2379
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:56,960
Get inside.

2380
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:57,300
Get inside.

2381
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:57,580
Get inside.

2382
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:00,500
How's our painting?

2383
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,760
It is... wobbly!

2384
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,580
Stay up for the night!

2385
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,760
What if I...

2386
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,220
I was about to say, what is that?

2387
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:15,820
It's my torch.

2388
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,020
I was like, there's something glowing outside!

2389
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,900
Stay up for the whole night?

2390
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,820
My computer is really...

2391
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:25,120
My computer is chugging, you guys.

2392
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,900
I'm not gonna lie.

2393
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,840
Do you think the cat will be okay?

2394
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,280
Where is the cat?

2395
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,240
Cat?

2396
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,380
Oh!

2397
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,360
There he is.

2398
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:41,340
The cat is actually the danger.

2399
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,730
The cat is actually the danger.

2400
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:45,990
The log...

2401
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,330
What's that?

2402
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:49,410
What does that mean?

2403
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,670
What's going on?

2404
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:50,990
Oh!

2405
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,930
What's that?

2406
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:53,430
Oh!

2407
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:54,690
Guys, I'm in danger.

2408
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:56,930
Guys, I think we should go to bed.

2409
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:58,870
Guys, I think we should sleep.

2410
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:07,920
Smell that log.

2411
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,080
Guys, I think we were in mega danger.

2412
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,600
Oh.

2413
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:14,680
Oh.

2414
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,340
Are we still in mega danger?

2415
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,620
Oh, okay.

2416
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,120
Never mind.

2417
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,370
No, we're fine.

2418
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:28,730
Everything's fine.

2419
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:35,750
Feed the cat first and foremost.

2420
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,480
Good morning, cat.

2421
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:43,600
Come on.

2422
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,120
Fill her up, baby.

2423
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,800
Why do we have both axes?

2424
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,320
I wonder what that was, though.

2425
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,380
There's so much.

2426
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,180
I'm too scared.

2427
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:01,860
This game...

2428
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,360
Oh, I want to see everything, but I'm too scared.

2429
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:08,600
I want to see everything, but I just had the baby.

2430
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,980
Oh, gosh.

2431
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:10,380
Okay.

2432
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,140
Okay.

2433
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:12,740
Okay.

2434
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:13,620
Okay.

2435
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:14,480
Okay.

2436
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,090
Oh, wait.

2437
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,570
I think I just wasted my water.

2438
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:28,710
I think I have to carry it first.

2439
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:30,950
I think I have to pick everything first.

2440
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,530
And then...

2441
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:32,590
Water.

2442
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,130
Stop being scared, VTuber.

2443
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:36,510
Okay.

2444
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:37,950
Okay, okay, okay.

2445
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,560
Chickens.

2446
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,220
You guys are killing it.

2447
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,240
Please move.

2448
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,560
So I can grab your babies.

2449
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:59,540
Holy moly.

2450
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,480
They...

2451
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,740
They laid so many eggs.

2452
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:02,760
They gotta poop out these damn eggs.

2453
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,560
Count them before...

2454
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,400
Oh, they're not hatching.

2455
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:12,440
They're getting sold off.

2456
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:14,860
161.

2457
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,720
Okay guys, we got a lot of money.

2458
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,480
So, what we're going to do?

2459
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,020
We're going to buy stamina.

2460
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:24,280
We're going to buy running speed.

2461
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,380
We're going to buy a carrying load.

2462
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,540
Oh, just one, not two.

2463
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,800
We're going to buy...

2464
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,720
this hook.

2465
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:32,720
It's so expensive, you guys can matter more about it.

2466
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,900
We're mowing the lawn!

2467
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,520
We're mowing the lawn now!

2468
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:44,420
Oh my gosh.

2469
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,640
They did say like keep your place clean.

2470
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:49,560
And...

2471
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,720
And less hauntings will happen.

2472
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,200
Oh, I gotta actually water now.

2473
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:03,090
A little bleep for you.

2474
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:03,870
Oh, hey chicken.

2475
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:05,430
A little shower for you.

2476
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,510
A little shower for you, chicken.

2477
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,810
Okay, let's go refill this.

2478
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:12,310
I'm guessing I use the sink.

2479
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:15,310
Right?

2480
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:16,450
Oh yeah.

2481
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:23,560
What if you buy a goat and the goat eats the grass for you?

2482
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:25,660
Wait, can I?

2483
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,060
I think the only livestock I have are chicken.

2484
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:32,440
We have a chicken fence, but they've been fine.

2485
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,860
I don't think I need to...

2486
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,900
I think it's a little dramatic, right?

2487
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,060
Here, let's get rid of all this.

2488
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,240
Let's clean up our lawn a little bit.

2489
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,700
I wonder... Oh, the tall grass?

2490
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,380
Maybe... Oh, watch out, chicken.

2491
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,100
I wonder if...

2492
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,340
It's like wheat?

2493
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,980
And then we could start selling wheat even, you know?

2494
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,990
Yes.

2495
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,190
Clean.

2496
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,910
Clean.

2497
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,270
Clean.

2498
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,170
Lawn.

2499
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:06,610
Clean.

2500
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,890
We're mowing the lawn.

2501
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:09,890
We're mowing the lawn.

2502
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,270
Look!

2503
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:11,250
It looks so much more...

2504
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,290
Habitable now.

2505
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,170
Let's go try and cut a wheat.

2506
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,050
Wait.

2507
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,970
Let's go this way.

2508
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,230
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2509
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:24,970
There's wheat over here.

2510
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:26,690
Wheat?

2511
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:27,210
Is this wheat?

2512
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:30,050
No.

2513
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,830
This is wheat.

2514
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,150
Is that the dog still?

2515
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:39,110
Oh my god, the dogs are still here.

2516
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:43,690
Oh, I'm sorry!

2517
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:46,470
They have to remind me of my past.

2518
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,190
Okay.

2519
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:51,190
Oh.

2520
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:52,450
Guys?

2521
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:56,850
I don't think we get anything from that.

2522
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:01,250
That's a little disappointing.

2523
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:02,390
What's over here?

2524
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,430
What's on our to-do list?

2525
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,390
Oh, nothing.

2526
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:11,470
Garrett's like, I have nothing left going for me in my life.

2527
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:12,650
Oh.

2528
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,070
I can't climb that.

2529
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:17,370
Okay.

2530
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,510
Is there not even a door?

2531
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:20,790
Don't people die in these things?

2532
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:22,130
The silos and stuff?

2533
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:22,670
Right?

2534
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:23,410
That's what that is, right?

2535
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:23,870
A silo?

2536
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:27,570
That looks really far, but I want to go to it.

2537
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:30,390
This game is going to be huge then, right?

2538
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,330
Because there's this fenced off area over here.

2539
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,470
And then this...

2540
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:38,790
Eventually, they're going to have to give us like a torch, right?

2541
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:39,430
That like...

2542
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:42,190
It's like a Minecraft or something for real, right?

2543
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:47,090
Yeah, they're terrifying.

2544
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:48,530
The silos?

2545
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:49,250
Yeah, right?

2546
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:54,210
It's going to be terrifying.

2547
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,190
I'm going to be running.

2548
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:57,530
And the days don't last that long.

2549
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,230
Oh, gosh.

2550
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:05,630
One thing, two...

2551
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,370
Oh, watch out, chicken.

2552
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:07,450
I'm mowing the lawn.

2553
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:08,470
Watch out, chicken.

2554
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:09,810
This will help me see my chickens better.

2555
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:13,810
Right now, they hide in the grass.

2556
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,390
No longer chicken.

2557
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,390
It did say we'll get livestock.

2558
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:20,750
So like cattle and stuff too.

2559
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:22,290
Oh.

2560
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:24,670
I heard someone breathing.

2561
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:29,670
Hello?

2562
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:32,390
Hello?

2563
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:45,970
Oh, it was me?

2564
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,790
Oh, the low stamina.

2565
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:48,310
Oh.

2566
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,250
You're right.

2567
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:56,310
Guys, let's go buy a gun.

2568
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:00,270
Actually, no.

2569
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,670
Ignite, ignite, ignite.

2570
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:08,490
Why can't I take down the big trees?

2571
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:15,650
The crickets are starting and that means trouble is afoot.

2572
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:22,230
And my chickens are like so mad.

2573
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:22,550
Get the eggs.

2574
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,870
Holy moly.

2575
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:26,710
Okay, let's sell these real quick.

2576
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,750
I didn't mean to throw that.

2577
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:40,520
What was that?

2578
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:41,740
What was that?

2579
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:43,820
Our painting is...

2580
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:44,020
Oh.

2581
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:45,480
Oh, no, no, no.

2582
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:48,440
It's this thing again.

2583
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,220
It's this thing again.

2584
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:50,800
The Babadook.

2585
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,120
That's creepy.

2586
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,420
Oh, what's that sound?

2587
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,440
I hear it.

2588
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,200
I hear it, you know.

2589
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,540
My game is really starting to lag.

2590
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:09,240
Okay.

2591
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,000
I think it's time for sleep.

2592
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:12,640
I think that's what that means.

2593
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,860
I think it's time for sleep.

2594
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:16,280
Is it, like, after me?

2595
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:16,920
Is that what that means?

2596
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:20,480
Yeah.

2597
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,720
Because it comes around and disappears.

2598
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:23,840
I want to see it.

2599
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,180
I want to see it!

2600
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,100
I want to see it!

2601
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,740
Stardew Valley doesn't look like how I remember it.

2602
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,680
Go outside.

2603
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,480
But I don't have my gun.

2604
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,640
Oh, my cat is right there.

2605
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:49,930
I think it's gone.

2606
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:54,570
Oh, never mind.

2607
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:55,070
Never mind.

2608
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:55,450
Never mind.

2609
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:57,550
It's this way?

2610
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,150
It's over here?

2611
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,530
Is it me or does my vision get weird too?

2612
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:06,950
Or am I crazy?

2613
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:08,190
I can't tell.

2614
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:11,650
Mint is the first to die in the scary movies?

2615
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:12,210
No, I'm not!

2616
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,380
There's nothing even here.

2617
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:22,460
Oh, maybe it's in my room?

2618
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,160
Do you guys see anything?

2619
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:29,800
Nothing here.

2620
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,300
He's terrorizing my chickens!

2621
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,260
Good night!

2622
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,100
Day nine!

2623
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:53,120
I'm not the first type to die in scary movies because I don't investigate.

2624
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,320
Why would I die if I'm not doing anything?

2625
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:01,260
First type to die are the ones that are just like, hello?

2626
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,320
I'm an unassuming person.

2627
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,420
I hear a terrible, frightening noise.

2628
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,360
I'm just gonna go check it out.

2629
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,280
Me?

2630
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:13,280
Never.

2631
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:14,980
Oh my gosh.

2632
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,600
Every time it gets me.

2633
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,180
Every time it gets me.

2634
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:21,660
Alright.

2635
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,460
You guys laid some eggs?

2636
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,740
Thank you, thank you for your...

2637
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,900
for your patronage.

2638
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,460
Thank you, thank you.

2639
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,060
Oh, there's two chickens in there.

2640
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,060
Are you guys both?

2641
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:37,700
Are you guys...

2642
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,400
Oh, now there's three chickens.

2643
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:42,780
Please move.

2644
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,700
All of them are right here!

2645
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,420
There's a whole...

2646
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:48,000
There's whole empty slots everywhere.

2647
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:49,900
Just like, go to another...

2648
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,160
Please.

2649
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,340
Please, chicken.

2650
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,420
Let me grab your eggs.

2651
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,420
Thank you.

2652
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:57,260
Thank you.

2653
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,280
Thank you very much.

2654
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,020
Thank you.

2655
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,380
At this rate, I'm just gonna keep hoarding...

2656
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:04,540
money.

2657
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:06,860
So...

2658
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:12,620
I think it's time for me to feed him.

2659
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,760
Buy a rifle and...

2660
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,400
face my fears.

2661
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,580
Confront my...

2662
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:20,600
my worries.

2663
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,220
Oh, there's been a log here the whole time?

2664
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,740
Quite honestly...

2665
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,340
Guys, can you tell that I'm scared?

2666
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,060
Can you tell?

2667
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,900
You can't even tell.

2668
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:40,860
I bet.

2669
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:51,950
Purchasing this item will start a sequence of events that culminates in the ending of the demo.

2670
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,270
Are you sure you want to continue?

2671
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:55,210
Okay.

2672
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:57,950
We could do one of two things.

2673
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,250
One, we could buy the rifle...

2674
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,630
and do the sequence of events that ends the demo.

2675
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:04,970
Or two...

2676
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:07,170
we can die...

2677
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:09,290
and then if the full game comes out...

2678
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:12,330
I start from when I buy the gun.

2679
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:14,030
That's the thing about...

2680
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:16,550
you know sometimes like how if you do a demo...

2681
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:18,150
you have to like replay...

2682
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:20,970
I mean I guess at this beginning of the game hasn't been very long.

2683
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:24,490
Hmm...

2684
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:28,870
Let me water my plants.

2685
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:34,510
Stay outside one night first?

2686
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:35,330
Oh!

2687
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:35,910
Cool.

2688
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:40,410
What is that?

2689
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:40,890
Oh.

2690
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:42,310
Is that what I use to...

2691
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,310
I just threw down my basket.

2692
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:47,070
Why is my vision all weird?

2693
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:48,350
Is it just me?

2694
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:48,710
Oh.

2695
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:50,530
It like looks...

2696
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:51,590
There's like a...

2697
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:52,530
It's like...

2698
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,050
motion blur in the side.

2699
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,130
It's more than usual, right?

2700
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,970
Or is it just me?

2701
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:58,010
No.

2702
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:00,410
It's definitely more blurry than usual.

2703
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,430
Am I losing sanity?

2704
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:04,930
Is it because I was staring at the guy?

2705
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:05,330
You think?

2706
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,030
Oh!

2707
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:07,050
Oh!

2708
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:08,930
Yeah!

2709
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:09,330
Yeah!

2710
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:09,830
It looks weird.

2711
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:12,390
Oh my gosh.

2712
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:13,650
That is so cute!

2713
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:16,830
Hold on...

2714
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:18,630
How's our painting looking?

2715
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:20,850
It's fine though.

2716
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:22,230
I'd rather not!

2717
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:23,910
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2718
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:25,230
We did feed our cat, right?

2719
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:26,670
Yeah.

2720
01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:29,970
It's a Vineyard.

2721
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:32,070
It did say something about mental state.

2722
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:32,550
It did.

2723
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:32,950
Yeah.

2724
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:34,750
Hmm...

2725
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:37,090
It's the black mold.

2726
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:38,030
Absolutely.

2727
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,840
Probably bugged.

2728
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,560
Oh, maybe.

2729
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,220
Might be bugged, yeah.

2730
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,000
Oh my gosh, no!

2731
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,400
But he's at game comms!

2732
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:49,280
We can't tell him!

2733
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,820
Did I get this one?

2734
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,440
There we go.

2735
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,490
I think it's bugged.

2736
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:06,270
A little bit.

2737
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:08,450
It's kind of making me woozy a bit.

2738
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:10,250
So maybe...

2739
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:17,770
Maybe I should die to restart.

2740
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:19,550
Or to get it fixed.

2741
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:21,850
I wish I could chop this thing down.

2742
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:27,190
For some reason, these little tiny trees, you can't chop them down.

2743
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:32,170
We're mowing the lawn!

2744
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,430
That's what makes us lose our sanity.

2745
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:38,910
Manual labor.

2746
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:42,570
But no!

2747
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:44,070
This is really beautiful!

2748
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:50,670
This game makes me want to never buy a house in the forest, ever.

2749
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:56,030
When I was a kid...

2750
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:02,050
We went to a cabin in the forest.

2751
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,010
For the summer.

2752
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:07,070
With me and my family.

2753
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:10,210
And it had a laundry chute, right?

2754
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:13,650
Which, it was a two-story cabin.

2755
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:16,510
And the laundry chute...

2756
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:18,730
Like, the room where I stayed with me and my sister...

2757
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,770
We...

2758
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,550
There was a little...

2759
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:23,090
Hole...

2760
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:25,290
That you threw your clothes down...

2761
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:26,810
And it would go to the laundry room, right?

2762
01:51:27,650 --> 01:51:28,070
And...

2763
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:28,950
So...

2764
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:29,630
You know...

2765
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:31,690
If my mom was doing the laundry...

2766
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,650
She could hear, like, my sister and I...

2767
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:34,670
Playing up in the room.

2768
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:36,790
And...

2769
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:38,730
One day, she heard me...

2770
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:40,070
Like, talking...

2771
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,350
And...

2772
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,410
I, like...

2773
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:42,810
I...

2774
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:45,410
Was, like, having a full conversation.

2775
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:47,410
And...

2776
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:49,430
My mom thought...

2777
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:51,010
I was playing with my sister.

2778
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,290
But then she was like...

2779
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:53,650
Wait...

2780
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:56,150
Sister...

2781
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:57,710
Went out with my...

2782
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:58,530
With my dad.

2783
01:51:59,130 --> 01:51:59,550
So...

2784
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:00,130
My mom...

2785
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,050
Came upstairs...

2786
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,270
To see if I was, like, playing.

2787
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,770
You know, maybe I was, like, playing dolls or whatever.

2788
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:07,330
And she...

2789
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,430
Um...

2790
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:09,870
She...

2791
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:11,090
Goes...

2792
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:12,030
Into...

2793
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:12,910
The room...

2794
01:52:12,910 --> 01:52:14,370
And sees that I'm just sitting on the bed.

2795
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,390
And, like, playing with my sister.

2796
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:16,450
And, like, talking to the air.

2797
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:18,490
And my mom was just like...

2798
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:19,770
Minto...

2799
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:21,430
Who are you talking to?

2800
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:23,270
And I was like...

2801
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:24,130
What do you mean, mom?

2802
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:26,430
I'm talking to this man right here.

2803
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:38,090
Isn't that so scary?

2804
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:43,690
And my...

2805
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,530
My mom...

2806
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:45,290
Asked the...

2807
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,650
The...

2808
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:46,830
The...

2809
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:47,190
Um...

2810
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:48,490
Owners of the place...

2811
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:49,130
Later on...

2812
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:50,150
She was just like...

2813
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:51,470
She was like...

2814
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:52,390
Um...

2815
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,550
You know...

2816
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:54,870
Has anything happened here before?

2817
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:56,490
And they were like...

2818
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:56,770
Oh...

2819
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:57,470
Well, you know...

2820
01:52:58,150 --> 01:52:58,670
The...

2821
01:52:58,670 --> 01:52:59,530
The...

2822
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:00,890
The original owner...

2823
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:02,390
Died on the property.

2824
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:05,410
So...

2825
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,190
Let's grab our little thingy.

2826
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:09,650
Our little...

2827
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:09,930
Oh!

2828
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:10,810
We have a tomato!

2829
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:12,890
So...

2830
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:13,490
All right.

2831
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:14,050
Now, run inside.

2832
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:15,410
Wait!

2833
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,690
Should I buy the gun?

2834
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:16,810
No!

2835
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,620
The original man.

2836
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,280
Oh, it's getting woozy!

2837
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,500
It's getting woozy!

2838
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,760
It's always so woozy.

2839
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,020
Oh!

2840
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:30,700
Wait.

2841
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,140
Is this the red night?

2842
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,780
Remember how like...

2843
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:34,220
Wait.

2844
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:34,900
Maybe not.

2845
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,780
Remember how one night it got like really red?

2846
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,600
And everything was red and red and red and red?

2847
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:40,980
You guys, I'm scared!

2848
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,860
I don't want to stay outside.

2849
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,700
I don't want to stay...

2850
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,720
What's the other door basement?

2851
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:46,060
Yeah.

2852
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,120
But we can't go in there.

2853
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,080
It's locked.

2854
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:49,300
I want to keep my lock shut.

2855
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:56,890
I kind of want to sleep, though, so we can get rid of this dizzy effect.

2856
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,460
Just don't get scared.

2857
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:02,760
Easy.

2858
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:16,030
Oh!

2859
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:17,470
It's like far away.

2860
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:19,890
Interesting.

2861
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:20,990
So, there's so...

2862
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:23,990
So, there's other ways of the painting we still haven't seen yet.

2863
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:27,010
I wonder how much is in this demo, you know?

2864
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:28,170
It's kind of crazy.

2865
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:31,890
You can like hear it, like, transforming, which is creepy.

2866
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,640
Oh, I hear music.

2867
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:37,800
Like an ambience.

2868
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,440
Oh, I hear an ambience.

2869
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,760
Stay up a bit tonight?

2870
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,740
I'm scared of doing that.

2871
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,160
Look at our chickens, they're going inside the coop.

2872
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:58,740
Look at them go!

2873
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:07,340
Oh, I got my little sickle.

2874
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,120
Chickens are so brave.

2875
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,460
Oh, a cat is looking at us!

2876
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,480
He's so cute too.

2877
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,400
Yep, enjoy your... why?

2878
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:26,000
Oh my god.

2879
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:39,570
We are not safe inside the house.

2880
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:44,430
We are not safe inside the house!

2881
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:47,490
Oh no, the blur is still there.

2882
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:48,830
Wait.

2883
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:52,110
Maybe not.

2884
01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:53,870
Maybe we're okay.

2885
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,910
Also, yeah, we sent this letter.

2886
01:55:59,170 --> 01:55:59,610
Right?

2887
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:00,870
Interesting.

2888
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:04,570
Still haven't seen anything about that.

2889
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:05,610
Buy the gun?

2890
01:56:05,770 --> 01:56:07,190
Okay, we're gonna buy the gun, everybody.

2891
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:09,310
Let's buy the gun.

2892
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:11,830
Wow, there's still so much in this game.

2893
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:13,050
Good morning!

2894
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:15,110
Oh my gosh, we can see our chickens so clearly.

2895
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:19,570
Our lawn looks great, doesn't it?

2896
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:22,590
It looks so...

2897
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:25,630
It's so clean.

2898
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:28,350
Our lawn is so clean.

2899
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,410
Oh, it looks like our house is on fire.

2900
01:56:33,370 --> 01:56:34,230
And our cat.

2901
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,350
Good morning, cat.

2902
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:41,850
Kind of weird that the game encourages going to bed as a defense mechanism.

2903
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:44,570
I don't think I would be able to in that circumstance, right?

2904
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:45,170
Right?

2905
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:54,650
I like that this game is so normal.

2906
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:57,450
And then also, it's like, by the way, you're also being haunted.

2907
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:02,670
This game feels like just a normal...

2908
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:04,530
Like, I'm just cutting my lawn.

2909
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,590
And it's like, oh, by the way, you're also haunted.

2910
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:10,030
Cutting the lawn, cutting the lawn.

2911
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:12,530
Yeah, it's still kind of glitched.

2912
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:15,290
So, I shall buy the gun.

2913
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:17,330
And...

2914
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:17,570
And...

2915
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:21,410
As soon as I finish cutting this area.

2916
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:22,290
Watch out, chicken.

2917
01:57:23,150 --> 01:57:23,850
Watch out, chicken.

2918
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:31,640
Perfect.

2919
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:34,720
Right?

2920
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:40,700
There's this whole section area, too.

2921
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,340
Oh, look!

2922
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,880
I didn't even notice you were in here!

2923
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,840
Okay, we gotta cut this lawn, too, you guys.

2924
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,860
We gotta cut the lawn.

2925
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:46,520
We gotta cut the lawn.

2926
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:48,800
Stalling?

2927
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:50,800
No...

2928
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,020
It's actually just kind of relaxing of a game until...

2929
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:54,300
It's not.

2930
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:58,040
You know what I mean?

2931
01:57:58,180 --> 01:57:59,360
It's just kind of like, ooh, yeah.

2932
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,680
Ooh, my computer's really chugging, though.

2933
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:04,220
Okay, let's get this over with so my computer can rest.

2934
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,380
Kind of cool, though, that there's still more that we haven't seen...

2935
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:12,640
In the demo.

2936
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:15,200
So, it makes me wonder how much is gonna be...

2937
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,380
How much...

2938
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:17,640
How much will there be in the...

2939
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:18,740
In the game...

2940
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,980
The main game, too, you know?

2941
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,660
My computer's about to blow up.

2942
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,200
Go for it, computer!

2943
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,540
Go for it!

2944
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:29,140
Fight!

2945
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,700
Like, I just kind of like doing this.

2946
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:41,180
Is it so wrong to want to just be a farmer on my little...

2947
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:43,660
My quiet life as a farmer?

2948
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,220
Alright, let's buy the gun.

2949
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:46,220
Oh, wait!

2950
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:47,860
Before we do that...

2951
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,160
Voices of the Void?

2952
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,680
Like, Outer Wilds?

2953
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,820
Oh, I guess I know what you mean.

2954
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,000
Where it's...

2955
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,220
It's not scary until it is.

2956
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:02,620
I get it, though.

2957
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:03,740
But we've had, like...

2958
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:08,100
We've seen, like, that person standing in my house in the middle of the day.

2959
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:10,920
And now she's in my bathroom.

2960
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,820
And now my sanity is low, low, low, I guess.

2961
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:21,300
Better laptop fun.

2962
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,400
I just bought this.

2963
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,580
No, actually, it's been having a lot of, like...

2964
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:33,620
I tried updating the drivers, but even still, like, it has been having a lot of issues.

2965
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:38,160
So, I shall return it once I get home.

2966
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,300
Finally, some good news.

2967
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:45,880
A gun!

2968
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:45,980
A gun!

2969
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,120
Fire...

2970
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:50,480
Aim...

2971
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:51,380
Aim...

2972
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:10,940
Little chicken.

2973
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:15,380
We don't need eggs.

2974
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,180
We need...

2975
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:18,100
How do I put my gun away?

2976
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:18,400
Okay.

2977
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,120
We need...

2978
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:22,120
We need meat.

2979
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,020
Am I gonna have to start killing the chickens?

2980
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:27,640
Wait, why do I need a gun?

2981
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:28,880
I mean, I guess they're actually...

2982
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,360
I don't...

2983
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:30,200
I say that, but...

2984
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,080
We've had a wolf problem.

2985
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:33,080
So, uh...

2986
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,380
Actually makes sense.

2987
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:34,860
Checks out.

2988
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,040
What else is there to buy?

2989
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:41,940
So, we have the rake.

2990
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:42,480
We haven't...

2991
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,160
We've been okay on money where that we haven't really had to, like...

2992
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,000
But look!

2993
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,980
Eventually, that's a blind mower, isn't it?

2994
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,100
Powerful auto-harvesting vehicle...

2995
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:53,460
Okay, nevermind.

2996
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:59,640
Sorry, the sounds really changed all of a sudden.

2997
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:04,870
Okay.

2998
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:07,890
What is this?

2999
02:01:08,330 --> 02:01:12,330
A simple wooden handle with nylon...

3000
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:14,270
bristles?

3001
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:17,390
A broom?

3002
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:21,090
A brush for livestock?

3003
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:23,470
And then, this is the ATV.

3004
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:25,010
The four-wheeler.

3005
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:25,350
It's a four-wheeler.

3006
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:26,470
It's a four-wheeler.

3007
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:27,890
Our meds.

3008
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:28,570
Throwing power.

3009
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:30,170
I haven't really needed to use that either.

3010
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:32,390
I guess that's good at night, if you're like...

3011
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:36,430
Uh...

3012
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:38,770
This is a mental enhancer?

3013
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:39,350
Oh...

3014
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,270
This is...

3015
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:43,650
Caffeine?

3016
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:45,770
Oh, maybe it makes you stay up at night?

3017
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:47,130
Energy booster?

3018
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:49,370
This is crazy.

3019
02:01:49,570 --> 02:01:50,690
Even stuff for the house.

3020
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,030
Fabric?

3021
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:56,450
Quality fabric?

3022
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:56,630
Oh, look.

3023
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:57,510
Oh, the furnishings package?

3024
02:01:58,590 --> 02:02:01,090
We can make this place really nice, actually.

3025
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:10,160
This is a real fixer-upper, but we're gonna fixer-upper.

3026
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:11,700
Right?

3027
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:14,140
Yeah.

3028
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:18,940
These chickens lay like crazy.

3029
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:26,820
So, was there something on my to-do list?

3030
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:27,360
Oh, shoot.

3031
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:28,160
Five cans?

3032
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,780
On the log pile.

3033
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:31,260
Easy.

3034
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:31,900
East of the house.

3035
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,580
Oh, um, wait, but it's night time.

3036
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:41,350
Um, east?

3037
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,340
We haven't gone that way.

3038
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:51,460
What is it?

3039
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:53,360
Five cans on the log pile?

3040
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:04,170
Wait, but, doesn't the sun...

3041
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:08,730
Why isn't the sun supposed to set in the west?

3042
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:15,690
That's west, but the thing is pointing... wait, you can see it, right?

3043
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:19,050
You can see it's pointing east.

3044
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:21,130
Um, developer?

3045
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:23,530
Uh, let's go inside.

3046
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:30,960
Did I feed the cat?

3047
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:32,480
Oh, shoot.

3048
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,420
Did I feed the cat?

3049
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,600
Yeah, we did.

3050
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,100
Okay, good.

3051
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,300
There's food, there's food, there's food, there's food, there's food.

3052
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:44,340
You did not feed the cat.

3053
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:44,760
Yes, I did.

3054
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,320
Look, there's food.

3055
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:48,760
The sun is haunted.

3056
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:51,340
The sun is not following conventional rules.

3057
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,460
The ghost is manipulating everything.

3058
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:56,480
Did you water the cat?

3059
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,340
Oh, gosh.

3060
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:08,100
Guys, I wanna be brave, I really do, but I'm scared of dying, honestly.

3061
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,440
I'm scared of dying and, like, having to restart.

3062
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:12,360
Well, if I die...

3063
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,320
Okay, hold on.

3064
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:16,400
If I die, I just start the day over again.

3065
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:17,400
And we didn't really do anything.

3066
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:18,500
Right?

3067
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:19,600
We just, uh...

3068
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:23,900
We just, um...

3069
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:24,680
What's the word?

3070
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:26,140
We just got the gun.

3071
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:29,060
The farm must be in the southern hemisphere.

3072
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:53,050
Oh, my chickens are so good.

3073
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:55,450
They listen so well.

3074
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:56,570
You know?

3075
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:00,590
Okay, I'm gonna stand right here, guys.

3076
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:04,250
Something, if something spooky is out here, it'll come to me.

3077
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:06,070
Hey!

3078
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,770
Ghost!

3079
02:05:08,290 --> 02:05:09,050
Oh, my God!

3080
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:11,130
The spooky thing is the cat!

3081
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:11,830
Uh-oh.

3082
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:17,330
If there's something spooky out here...

3083
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:20,470
It'll come to me!

3084
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,250
Maybe.

3085
02:05:25,930 --> 02:05:26,570
Is there?

3086
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:29,710
Let's check the painting.

3087
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:32,030
Oh, sorry, I thought I just saw something.

3088
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:35,530
It hasn't changed much.

3089
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:36,550
Oh.

3090
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:37,410
Uh-oh.

3091
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:38,130
Um...

3092
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:38,730
Uh-oh.

3093
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:39,290
Uh-oh.

3094
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:39,750
Okay.

3095
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:40,310
Uh...

3096
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:41,330
I think I do need to go to bed.

3097
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:41,930
Oh, God.

3098
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:42,410
Oh, God!

3099
02:05:43,010 --> 02:05:43,370
Oh!

3100
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:43,610
Ah!

3101
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:50,080
Remember to go to bed on time to avoid losing money!

3102
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:50,940
Oh!

3103
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:52,220
What?

3104
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:57,530
I passed out.

3105
02:05:57,690 --> 02:05:58,690
I lost three dollars.

3106
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:02,970
Okay.

3107
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:04,690
So that happened.

3108
02:06:07,450 --> 02:06:09,430
I didn't even stay up that late, though.

3109
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:10,230
Right?

3110
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:13,730
I feel like that was pretty nice.

3111
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:14,150
It's pretty normal time.

3112
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:16,550
The ghost robbed me.

3113
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:21,770
The ghost robbed me.

3114
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:28,150
Wow, the birds in the distance are so beautiful!

3115
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:32,210
Oh, this game is probably so awesome on, like, high-quality graphics.

3116
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:33,290
I wish I were home.

3117
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:34,310
I should have played this when I was home.

3118
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:36,810
The ghost steal three dollars from you?

3119
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:39,350
That's a lot of money in my little ghost economy.

3120
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:40,450
Okay.

3121
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:41,890
Okay.

3122
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:42,570
Okay.

3123
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:43,150
Okay.

3124
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:43,710
Okay.

3125
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,110
That's a lot of money!

3126
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:48,390
Did you see how much eggs costed me?

3127
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:53,350
Wait.

3128
02:06:57,550 --> 02:06:58,070
But...

3129
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:03,890
I think maybe I was staying up too late.

3130
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:04,830
I'm guessing.

3131
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:07,090
Because the motion blur is gone.

3132
02:07:07,450 --> 02:07:10,870
So maybe... it was that.

3133
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,930
I was staying up late.

3134
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:13,690
And...

3135
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:22,270
And it was a... like I just had low tolerance at that point.

3136
02:07:22,610 --> 02:07:24,230
Guess I better go to bed now.

3137
02:07:26,710 --> 02:07:30,030
Alright, let's water this and then we'll go shoot some cayennes, I guess.

3138
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:32,310
We haven't been to that area, so...

3139
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:35,370
The ghost stole three dollars from me.

3140
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:39,670
How funny.

3141
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:44,290
Oh my gosh, I thought I just saw someone standing there.

3142
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:44,970
That scared me.

3143
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,050
I think it was just my imagination.

3144
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:48,090
Oh, let's feed the cat.

3145
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:49,270
Hey cat!

3146
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:50,670
Oh, um...

3147
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,750
Our backyard looks awesome.

3148
02:07:58,210 --> 02:07:59,410
I guess this is technic-

3149
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:06,940
Why is it woozy already?

3150
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:07,980
It's daytime!

3151
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,440
What are you talking about?

3152
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,000
It's woozy!

3153
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:11,760
But it's daytime!

3154
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:13,660
Oh no, no, no!

3155
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:16,020
Why is it woozy during the day?

3156
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:24,430
Three cans on a log east of the...

3157
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:27,090
This way?

3158
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,140
These cans?

3159
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:46,230
Uh oh.

3160
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:47,770
You gotta be kidding me.

3161
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:01,900
I'm sorry.

3162
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:05,440
We'll just never mow the lawn here.

3163
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,380
Oh my god.

3164
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:10,340
Did I do it?

3165
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:13,000
Yep, I shot the cans.

3166
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,900
What else is down here?

3167
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,300
Oh, another fence.

3168
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:19,240
Okay, yeah, the government is testing us for sure.

3169
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:26,520
Why is our whole property fenced off with this, like, industrial fencing?

3170
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:32,250
Our ghost made... oh.

3171
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:33,910
I'll never leave here again.

3172
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,510
So the gate stays locked.

3173
02:09:36,110 --> 02:09:38,550
Only the county flatbed hauler comes and goes.

3174
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:38,870
What?

3175
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:41,730
This must be the work of the phantom thieves!

3176
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:46,590
Look how beautiful it is here though.

3177
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:48,710
This is actually... wait, can we chop down these trees?

3178
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:53,030
No.

3179
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:56,730
I think maybe we get a better axe and we'll eventually be able to?

3180
02:09:58,130 --> 02:09:58,570
Deforestation!

3181
02:09:58,690 --> 02:09:59,490
The whole place!

3182
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:04,770
How did the wolves get in?

3183
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:06,210
They jumped.

3184
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,460
Oh my god, wait.

3185
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:17,980
Oh, I thought this was someone behind the tree again!

3186
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:19,480
It's the tree itself!

3187
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:22,920
Oh my god, that scared the bajonkas out of me.

3188
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:24,500
Okay.

3189
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,640
Well, um...

3190
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,020
We can go to bed if we wanted to, I guess.

3191
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:32,080
Middle of the day, who cares?

3192
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:35,900
Oh my god!

3193
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:36,600
No, I'm sorry.

3194
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,260
I'm so sorry.

3195
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:42,600
I'm just trying to take your eggs...

3196
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,140
And sell them.

3197
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,460
For big money.

3198
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:50,120
I love my chickens.

3199
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:51,960
They give me so much money!

3200
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:53,200
They give me so much money!

3201
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,300
My chickens are awesome.

3202
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:59,220
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3203
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,280
More egg, more egg, more egg.

3204
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:11,950
Just looking around.

3205
02:11:12,750 --> 02:11:14,170
Just looking at my property.

3206
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:16,310
I'm a property owner.

3207
02:11:17,230 --> 02:11:18,530
It's pretty impressive, you guys.

3208
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:22,850
Actually, the most impressive thing is that the wolves haven't eaten my chickens.

3209
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:29,970
I can imagine, probably in the full version, that that might actually become a problem, right?

3210
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:31,730
Like, that might actually be...

3211
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:34,270
A thing.

3212
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:42,490
Let's open up some extra ways to, like...

3213
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:45,030
Go inside.

3214
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:47,390
Wasn't there another path?

3215
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:49,850
Oh, wait, this one right here, right?

3216
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:54,530
You are really not a dog person.

3217
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:55,970
The game forces me!

3218
02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:57,850
The game forces my hand!

3219
02:11:59,290 --> 02:12:00,550
What is this way, even?

3220
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:02,870
Do you think I have time?

3221
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:06,250
Okay, we'll check this out tomorrow.

3222
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:06,830
Maybe.

3223
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:11,770
But that was your fence.

3224
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:14,730
Yeah, but I can't hop over it.

3225
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:15,230
Here.

3226
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:16,730
Since we're here...

3227
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:20,510
Let's make this area so beautiful.

3228
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:24,810
Let's cut the grass and make it lovely.

3229
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:27,550
This is the front door, technically, right?

3230
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:30,330
Is it still woozy, I think?

3231
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:33,610
Why is it so woozy?

3232
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:36,590
It's daytime!

3233
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:36,770
Daytime!

3234
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:38,390
Uh-oh.

3235
02:12:39,570 --> 02:12:40,690
I heard it.

3236
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,650
I heard it transform again.

3237
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:43,950
Oh, it's...

3238
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:45,070
Open.

3239
02:12:45,370 --> 02:12:46,350
Whatever that means.

3240
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:49,130
What time is it?

3241
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:53,550
Evening?

3242
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:55,930
Cone bar noir?

3243
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:00,130
It's becoming...

3244
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:02,270
The evening now?

3245
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:05,770
I guess we'll go to sleep.

3246
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:06,190
Otherwise...

3247
02:13:06,190 --> 02:13:08,670
Otherwise, we just pass out and lose my...

3248
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:10,610
$41.

3249
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:14,630
What if the more you pass out, even, the more money they steal from you?

3250
02:13:14,930 --> 02:13:16,350
The ghosts taking your lunch?

3251
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:16,830
Oh, my God.

3252
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:18,090
The game is really lagging.

3253
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:19,450
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3254
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:21,170
It's not the game.

3255
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:21,650
I promise.

3256
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:22,630
It's my computer.

3257
02:13:26,770 --> 02:13:27,350
Oh, my God.

3258
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:28,470
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3259
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,270
But good night, cat.

3260
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:29,730
Good night.

3261
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:34,790
Wait, it's normal.

3262
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:41,390
It's normal, though.

3263
02:13:48,930 --> 02:13:49,990
I'm hearing stuff.

3264
02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:51,790
I'm scared of the bathroom.

3265
02:13:52,490 --> 02:13:54,110
I can't even pee in peace.

3266
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:55,690
Everything is bad.

3267
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:59,970
Well, let's go to bed because we finished our to-do list.

3268
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:01,650
So, let's just go to bed.

3269
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:03,490
The basement, I don't think...

3270
02:14:03,490 --> 02:14:06,010
I think it'll let us know when we can go into the basement.

3271
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:08,290
We cannot.

3272
02:14:08,290 --> 02:14:09,410
I think it...

3273
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:15,050
I think this is the type of game that will be like, Oh, I can finally go into the basement.

3274
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:16,350
Was this always peeled?

3275
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,630
Was that always that bad?

3276
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:27,510
I like that we lay sideways in bed.

3277
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:29,350
Day 12.

3278
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:47,690
Uh-oh.

3279
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:50,090
Oh, the wolves got him.

3280
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:51,870
And you said they'd provide the witness, right?

3281
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:52,830
The wolves got him.

3282
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,730
Yeah, they said it's not ideal, but we can just grab someone from the tax office.

3283
02:14:55,730 --> 02:14:56,910
I'm a baby now.

3284
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:57,670
I'm a baby.

3285
02:14:57,890 --> 02:14:59,250
Oh, I can't believe we're doing this.

3286
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:00,850
Oh, I think he's waking up.

3287
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:01,130
Hm?

3288
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:02,370
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

3289
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:03,230
It's okay, Garrett.

3290
02:15:03,490 --> 02:15:04,810
You keep resting, sweetie.

3291
02:15:04,970 --> 02:15:05,410
I'm Garrett.

3292
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:06,270
We got a ways to go.

3293
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:07,010
I'm a baby.

3294
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:07,970
I'm a baby now.

3295
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:10,850
Okay, we're here.

3296
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:11,830
Dad.

3297
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:12,670
You scoop him up.

3298
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:14,350
He'll wake up on the way.

3299
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:17,050
Why am I pretending to be asleep?

3300
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:18,450
Okay, I got you, bud.

3301
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:19,270
I got you.

3302
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:19,630
It's okay.

3303
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:24,130
Oh, oh, Dad.

3304
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:25,530
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

3305
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:25,670
Oh, my God.

3306
02:15:25,670 --> 02:15:25,710
Oh, my God.

3307
02:15:25,710 --> 02:15:25,850
Oh, my God.

3308
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:26,810
Oh, my God.

3309
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:27,250
Dad.

3310
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:27,950
I won't leave you again.

3311
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:30,430
Dad.

3312
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:32,690
What are you...

3313
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,500
I can't move.

3314
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:48,770
Hello.

3315
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:49,170
Dad.

3316
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:49,610
Dad.

3317
02:15:49,990 --> 02:15:51,210
When are you getting here?

3318
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:53,350
Did you get my letter?

3319
02:15:53,590 --> 02:15:55,550
Oh, the letter we sent.

3320
02:15:55,930 --> 02:15:57,090
I'm just so tired.

3321
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:59,890
I have so many years left.

3322
02:16:00,250 --> 02:16:00,730
Dad.

3323
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:01,690
What am I gonna do?

3324
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:06,510
Maybe coming out here wasn't a good idea after all.

3325
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:08,850
I can't go back.

3326
02:16:09,490 --> 02:16:11,530
I'd rather die than go back.

3327
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:14,530
Voice acting in this is pretty good.

3328
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,540
Good morning, chickens.

3329
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:23,440
Oh, oh, oh.

3330
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,100
There's people.

3331
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:24,820
Oh, my God.

3332
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:26,040
Oh, my God.

3333
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,300
There's people in my lawn.

3334
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:32,540
What are you doing on my lawn?

3335
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:32,960
Oh, my God.

3336
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:33,760
Oh, my God.

3337
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,080
Oh, oh.

3338
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:36,660
There's ghost in my lawn.

3339
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:37,760
Wait.

3340
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:38,560
There's a lot of people here.

3341
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:44,920
Do you think this is the wife I probably killed?

3342
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:48,580
Hey!

3343
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,440
Hey, you!

3344
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:51,540
Hey, you!

3345
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:52,580
Hey, you!

3346
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,540
I'm gonna buy it.

3347
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,560
I'm gonna buy the running upgrade so I can come see your face.

3348
02:16:58,380 --> 02:16:59,420
I scared them away.

3349
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,020
Is this one over there?

3350
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:01,420
No.

3351
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,520
Oh, there's...

3352
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:02,960
Oh, there's...

3353
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:03,420
There's a lady in the woods.

3354
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:07,840
Get off my lawn!

3355
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:08,720
Get off my lawn!

3356
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:13,630
There's music even.

3357
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:16,250
Is this Death Stranding?

3358
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:20,430
I know, with the music and the rain and everything, it feels like it.

3359
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:23,690
This is very Death Stranding core, huh?

3360
02:17:28,580 --> 02:17:30,080
Just get to the end of the day.

3361
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,680
Oh no, we're depressed, you guys!

3362
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,420
Our farm is not good enough, I think.

3363
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,940
I'll keep cleaning up.

3364
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,500
Let's get to the end of the day.

3365
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:45,960
The voice acting in this is really good, though.

3366
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:46,940
Like, actually.

3367
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:53,420
So far, I really like what it's got going for it, because it's like...

3368
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:56,820
Like I said, it's just a normal farming simulator, and then...

3369
02:17:58,400 --> 02:17:59,180
And then ghosts.

3370
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,200
Our cat!

3371
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:03,080
Let's go feed our cat.

3372
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:04,500
That will keep us motivated.

3373
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:05,980
Our pet!

3374
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:07,820
Yeah!

3375
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,980
Our little kitty visitor!

3376
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:13,020
This keeps us motivated.

3377
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:14,240
To continue.

3378
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,200
We gotta wake up so we can feed him, right?

3379
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:17,520
Right!

3380
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:25,730
This is so depressing, actually.

3381
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:43,020
I think I'm going to be so baby, though, exploring this world.

3382
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:46,980
Knowing that there's going to be issues at night.

3383
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:47,540
But!

3384
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:49,580
I have to... I have to know.

3385
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:50,240
I have to face...

3386
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,620
I really have to face my fears, you guys.

3387
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:51,980
Okay.

3388
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,520
I have to face my fears.

3389
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,460
I have to go out.

3390
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,340
I have to...

3391
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:56,280
I have to...

3392
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:57,320
Because...

3393
02:18:57,320 --> 02:19:03,820
Because there will be times when I go outside, exploring the big world, and there will be ghosts, and I have to see them!

3394
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,540
It's not just tears, it's the rain.

3395
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:17,680
This is, I guess, not copyrighted music, because...

3396
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:19,360
I switched that off.

3397
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:19,600
Oh!

3398
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:20,140
Alright.

3399
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:20,800
Okay.

3400
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:27,850
This is the second time.

3401
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:28,290
Look at our lawn.

3402
02:19:28,390 --> 02:19:28,890
It looks so good!

3403
02:19:30,130 --> 02:19:31,270
It looks so clean!

3404
02:19:31,870 --> 02:19:32,950
It looks so clean.

3405
02:19:32,970 --> 02:19:33,550
It looks so clean.

3406
02:19:34,310 --> 02:19:34,750
Actually...

3407
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:35,470
But I'm happy.

3408
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:38,610
You can face your fears when you aren't depressed.

3409
02:19:39,150 --> 02:19:39,790
You know what?

3410
02:19:39,870 --> 02:19:40,550
So true.

3411
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:43,990
Holy Moly.

3412
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:45,710
This...

3413
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:46,670
This is so...

3414
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:48,590
What if I get two more chickens, you guys?

3415
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:50,670
We will be having...

3416
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:54,170
I think we're just a straight up chicken farm...

3417
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:55,170
At this point.

3418
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:57,310
We don't need to farm anything else.

3419
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:58,250
All we have are chickens.

3420
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:00,170
And we're good.

3421
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:04,010
Oh my god, he laid another egg!

3422
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:08,690
Look at all these chickens.

3423
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:10,350
I'm gonna buy more chickens.

3424
02:20:17,970 --> 02:20:18,710
I did it.

3425
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:21,190
I did it.

3426
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:22,850
I said I would and I did.

3427
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:26,150
Oh my god, two more eggs!

3428
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:30,450
Look at all my little chickens.

3429
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:33,230
Oh my god.

3430
02:20:33,490 --> 02:20:34,690
Get out my crops!

3431
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:37,430
Oh, I need to buy a scarecrow.

3432
02:20:39,890 --> 02:20:40,690
Oh, oops.

3433
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:44,450
Those eggs are definitely fine and not broken at all.

3434
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:45,830
I need to buy a scarecrow!

3435
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:51,230
Okay, wait.

3436
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:52,690
Where is it though?

3437
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:54,530
Is it still in here?

3438
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:57,150
I'll be honest.

3439
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,250
Oh, farming.

3440
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:02,410
I haven't been wanting to buy it because look how terrifying this thing is!

3441
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:04,630
Um, hello?

3442
02:21:05,310 --> 02:21:06,630
I don't want to buy this thing!

3443
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:07,850
It's so scary!

3444
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:11,970
He laid another egg.

3445
02:21:14,610 --> 02:21:16,690
I'm gonna get scared by my own scarecrow!

3446
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:21,710
He ate...

3447
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:25,870
He ate... No, he ate one of my tomatoes!

3448
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:26,810
I was supposed to have three!

3449
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:34,160
Just get to the end of the day.

3450
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,560
Our poor guy.

3451
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:36,400
Come on, Garrett.

3452
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:36,880
It's okay.

3453
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,840
Um, what is it?

3454
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:39,140
Oh, cue.

3455
02:21:44,250 --> 02:21:45,050
It's okay, Garrett.

3456
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:48,530
Even though it's raining, we're still watering our plants.

3457
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:51,910
I guess the rain doesn't really do anything, huh?

3458
02:21:53,310 --> 02:21:54,330
Still gotta water them.

3459
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:58,130
Watch out, chickens.

3460
02:21:58,590 --> 02:21:59,690
I'm mowing here.

3461
02:22:00,510 --> 02:22:01,870
Doing my farmer duties.

3462
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:09,120
Just the sound of the rain.

3463
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:11,460
Sound of our chickens.

3464
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,880
A little cat wandering around.

3465
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:19,640
We have a really good place going here.

3466
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,340
Ignore the ghost lady that sometimes appears in my bathroom.

3467
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,020
Just like me.

3468
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:28,940
You know?

3469
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:30,720
Ooh.

3470
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,080
I think that's our depression.

3471
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:33,800
I think that's why.

3472
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:36,500
Flush the spirits!

3473
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:37,440
Flush the spirits!

3474
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:43,580
I fed the cat, right?

3475
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:44,520
Yeah.

3476
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:51,730
I guess it's night?

3477
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:54,990
Cause it's...

3478
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,640
Um... Yeah.

3479
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:02,500
I hear crickets.

3480
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,960
It's kinda hard to hear them.

3481
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:05,720
Good night, everybody.

3482
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:07,140
Oh, the sun's going down.

3483
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:13,240
Check the fridge?

3484
02:23:13,460 --> 02:23:14,480
For our beans?

3485
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:16,000
That's why we're depressed!

3486
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:17,820
We're just eating beans every day!

3487
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:22,240
We're eating beans and...

3488
02:23:23,710 --> 02:23:26,100
Beans and tomatoes every day!

3489
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:35,900
We have... We don't even have chairs!

3490
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,100
Okay, we made it to the end of the day.

3491
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,320
Time for sleep time.

3492
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,500
It's okay.

3493
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:46,140
We'll go to sleep.

3494
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:48,400
We'll go to sleep for you, Garrett, since you're depressed, you know?

3495
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:50,800
Oh my goodness.

3496
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,480
Follow me!

3497
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:07,090
Holy goosebumps all down my spine!

3498
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:08,710
What do you want with me?

3499
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:10,830
Can't I just live here in peace?

3500
02:24:11,470 --> 02:24:12,690
Is that too much to ask?

3501
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:16,170
It's not the ghosts that are making you depressed, Garrett.

3502
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:17,290
It's the beans.

3503
02:24:19,370 --> 02:24:21,810
Something wants me to follow it to the shed.

3504
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:23,970
North-east of the house.

3505
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:25,850
She sounded cute.

3506
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:26,530
I'd do it.

3507
02:24:26,930 --> 02:24:27,450
Oh!

3508
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:28,910
Our bed is gone!

3509
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:30,010
Oh my gosh.

3510
02:24:32,490 --> 02:24:33,010
Oh.

3511
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:35,110
Okay.

3512
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:38,310
Um...

3513
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,440
Oh!

3514
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:43,520
There we go.

3515
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:51,880
Shed north-east of the house.

3516
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:53,800
North-east, right?

3517
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:54,080
Yeah.

3518
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:55,680
So...

3519
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:57,820
That way.

3520
02:24:58,020 --> 02:24:59,920
Oh my gosh.

3521
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:01,720
I thought that was... This little...

3522
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:06,920
Like the handle, I thought was eyes staring at me.

3523
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:07,620
Oh my gosh.

3524
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:10,280
Holy cow!

3525
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:11,880
This game is making me nervous!

3526
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,340
Um... Next page.

3527
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:19,640
This map is going to be humongous!

3528
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:22,240
Oh my gosh!

3529
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:25,660
Wait, this is our first time traversing outside, you guys.

3530
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,340
I'm gonna take the axe.

3531
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:30,800
I don't know.

3532
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:33,900
I know the gun is great and all, but I feel more safe with the axe.

3533
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:44,330
The game be lagging.

3534
02:25:44,570 --> 02:25:45,510
Wait, so this way.

3535
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:47,850
That trail, probably, from earlier.

3536
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:51,890
I'm scared!

3537
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:53,410
I'm scared!

3538
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:54,090
I'm scared!

3539
02:25:54,150 --> 02:25:54,670
I'm scared!

3540
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:55,110
I'm scared!

3541
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:55,450
I'm scared!

3542
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:55,830
I'm scared!

3543
02:25:55,870 --> 02:25:56,130
I'm scared!

3544
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:58,550
I'm scaa- Wait.

3545
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:01,530
Where is the path anyway?

3546
02:26:08,370 --> 02:26:10,030
Well now you can see the home from here.

3547
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,360
Is the painting okay?

3548
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:21,080
Okay, the painting is just our depression.

3549
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:21,620
Okay, the painting is just our depression.

3550
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:24,140
Oh!

3551
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:24,580
Cat!

3552
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,800
If I don't make it back, buddy... If I don't make it back...

3553
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,820
Eat all the chickens, okay?

3554
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:36,220
If I don't make it back, you are allowed to eat the chickens.

3555
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,320
I give you permission.

3556
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,680
Just let them fertilize the eggs!

3557
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:44,860
And keep eating the chickens!

3558
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:48,540
Where's the... It's this way, north?

3559
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:49,900
Okay, I see the path.

3560
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:54,180
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3561
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:54,960
I don't wanna go out.

3562
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,580
I don't wanna be out here.

3563
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,180
I don't wanna be out here.

3564
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:56,860
I don't wanna be out here.

3565
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:57,500
I don't wanna be out here.

3566
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,120
I don't wanna be out here.

3567
02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:58,780
I don't wanna be out here.

3568
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,780
I don't wanna be out here.

3569
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:03,480
I don't wanna be out here.

3570
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:03,560
I don't wanna be out here.

3571
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:04,860
I'm saving my stamina for now.

3572
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:07,400
I didn't even know there was a shed over here.

3573
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:09,060
We didn't follow the path.

3574
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,540
I don't even know there was anything out here.

3575
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,640
Is there any... Oh!

3576
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:16,880
Is there any zinc?

3577
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:18,320
To sell?

3578
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,120
You think?

3579
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:22,360
What's in the shed?

3580
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,500
I'm gonna shed myself right now.

3581
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:26,460
Oh my god, please.

3582
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:28,100
No!

3583
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:29,680
I'm scared!

3584
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:30,500
I'm scared!

3585
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:30,860
I'm scared!

3586
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:33,680
It's all on your head, Garrett.

3587
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:35,420
Stop being such a little bitch.

3588
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,700
You lunatic.

3589
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:37,080
Okay.

3590
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:37,940
Stop it!

3591
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:38,720
Don't be mean to me!

3592
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:42,660
Gosh.

3593
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:46,560
Garrett's calling me a little bitch, you guys.

3594
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:50,940
He's calling me a little bitch!

3595
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,120
I'm so scared!

3596
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:58,360
Oh gosh.

3597
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:01,120
And the TV has a god in me!

3598
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:02,760
Oh my god, I'm scared.

3599
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:03,740
Oh.

3600
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,000
Numbers.

3601
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:06,620
Okay.

3602
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:08,720
Prove him wrong.

3603
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:15,410
Just runnin', swingin'.

3604
02:28:15,410 --> 02:28:19,250
I should've bought more stamps.

3605
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:19,470
Stamina.

3606
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:22,550
How much stamina do I have?

3607
02:28:22,650 --> 02:28:22,650
Oh.

3608
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:23,010
Okay.

3609
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:23,490
Nevermind.

3610
02:28:24,510 --> 02:28:25,150
I don't know.

3611
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:25,490
Okay.

3612
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:26,110
I'm going in.

3613
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:27,610
I'm going in.

3614
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:28,050
I'm going in.

3615
02:28:28,050 --> 02:28:28,450
I'm going in.

3616
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:28,870
I'm going in.

3617
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,730
What is this?

3618
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:30,450
Read?

3619
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:32,070
Look.

3620
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:34,090
Back away.

3621
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:36,890
But don't look too long.

3622
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:39,570
Okay.

3623
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:39,930
Okay.

3624
02:28:40,290 --> 02:28:41,110
I'm going.

3625
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:44,570
What am I looking at?

3626
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:46,130
Oh, my heart's beating.

3627
02:28:50,250 --> 02:28:50,790
Oh, my God.

3628
02:28:51,010 --> 02:28:52,310
Uh-I think there's children.

3629
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:54,430
I think there's children trying to kill me.

3630
02:28:58,670 --> 02:28:59,450
Oh, my God.

3631
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:00,390
Oh, back away.

3632
02:29:00,570 --> 02:29:01,530
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3633
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:03,470
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

3634
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:04,750
But don't look for too long.

3635
02:29:05,470 --> 02:29:05,790
Okay.

3636
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:06,730
Where's my house?

3637
02:29:07,990 --> 02:29:08,830
Oh, my gosh.

3638
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:09,570
The children.

3639
02:29:09,670 --> 02:29:09,970
The children.

3640
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:10,370
The children.

3641
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:10,750
The children.

3642
02:29:11,230 --> 02:29:12,370
But don't look for too long.

3643
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:17,420
My house.

3644
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:17,780
My house.

3645
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:18,060
My house.

3646
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:20,080
Close the door.

3647
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:22,840
Oh I heard them running, I heard them running, I heard them running!

3648
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:24,180
What is that?

3649
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:24,700
Oh my god.

3650
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:26,900
Hello?

3651
02:29:32,670 --> 02:29:34,310
My game is lagging so bad.

3652
02:29:35,010 --> 02:29:35,370
Claire?

3653
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:37,650
I'm so sorry.

3654
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:41,310
Is that my... Is that my wife?

3655
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:42,830
She's kinda...

3656
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:50,410
Is

3657
02:29:56,670 --> 02:29:57,770
that a baby?

3658
02:29:57,950 --> 02:29:59,110
What was going on?

3659
02:29:59,210 --> 02:29:59,590
What's happening?

3660
02:30:00,010 --> 02:30:02,930
My whole

3661
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,800
body is so tired.

3662
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:18,120
Oh my gosh.

3663
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:22,360
Full game includes new tools, crops, vehicles, and haunting enemies.

3664
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:26,340
One square mile of land to explore, crafted with love.

3665
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:29,800
Oh look, there's a little... That's a little goat!

3666
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:31,700
Maybe we do get a goat after all.

3667
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:35,680
An emotional 4 plus hour story with an unforgettable ending.

3668
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:38,500
Bonuses like endless mo...

3669
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:41,460
Endless mode, dev commentary, and more!

3670
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:45,400
Oh my gosh.

3671
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:49,880
Yeah, it's a little lamb.

3672
02:30:52,380 --> 02:30:52,900
You know me.

3673
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:54,380
This land...

3674
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:55,860
Oh, oh.

3675
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:02,940
Wait, this looks like the eyeball that was in that note.

3676
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:06,080
This land would be completely barren.

3677
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:11,660
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna wishlist this though.

3678
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:14,620
I'm gonna wishlist it for sure.

3679
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:18,440
I'm gonna play with somebody because I'm too scared to play by myself.

3680
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:29,680
So, I don't think we harvested any shadows.

3681
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:32,000
But we sure did get a bunch of eggs.

3682
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:33,060
My cat!

3683
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:34,760
Oh, my cat's okay.

3684
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,480
Too scary for me, Dayo.

3685
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:39,160
That was so scary.

3686
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,040
Fun, cozy little game.

3687
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:41,880
Absolutely.

3688
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:48,160
Goodness.

3689
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:53,540
We harvest eggs.

3690
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,600
This isn't as good of a time.

3691
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:56,440
That's me though, right?

3692
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:57,040
Coming inside.

3693
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,860
Maybe I should have worded that differently.

3694
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:12,370
Never thought I would see a combo of Silent Hill and Harvest Moon.

3695
02:32:12,490 --> 02:32:13,150
Thanks for the stream.

3696
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:13,430
Yeah!

3697
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:22,920
It is definitely...

3698
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:23,640
It is a harvest.

3699
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:24,260
But it...

3700
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:26,220
Yeah, it's a Harvest Moon and Silent Hill.

3701
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:27,540
It's like a very...

3702
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:29,960
Yeah, I think that's probably the best way to put it, huh?

3703
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:34,620
It's like Harvest Moon, but you're already married and you don't even know what you're doing and your wife jump scares you.

3704
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:38,000
But also, the wife was like decapitated, right?

3705
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:38,940
In...

3706
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:39,840
In that...

3707
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,580
In that room.

3708
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:41,260
She was all...

3709
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:44,880
She was all greened out and decapitated and freaky looking.

3710
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:47,540
But he talked about her like she's alive.

3711
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,280
He was like, do you ever think of me?

3712
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,000
So, I don't think it's like a Silent Hill situation.

3713
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:54,920
Hopefully.

3714
02:32:56,180 --> 02:32:57,560
Thanks for the Mario Maker.

3715
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:07,000
We'll see.

3716
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:15,830
No head versus too much head.

3717
02:33:15,910 --> 02:33:16,150
Those...

3718
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:18,490
Those twins that were after me, definitely no head.

3719
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:19,850
They were like...

3720
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:21,710
They were...

3721
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:26,030
They were coming at me with no head, for real.

3722
02:33:26,510 --> 02:33:28,370
And like half of no body.

3723
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:29,730
Thanks for the fun stream.

3724
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:32,130
Will be interesting to see what the full story ends up being.

3725
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:33,190
Yeah, definitely.

3726
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:34,910
Curious.

3727
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:36,270
Very curious.

3728
02:33:37,470 --> 02:33:37,950
Indeed.

3729
02:33:40,310 --> 02:33:43,470
Like that it's more of a psychological horror site instead of jump scares.

3730
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:44,390
There were...

3731
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:44,910
The...

3732
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:47,010
The scares were sometimes very subtle too.

3733
02:33:47,110 --> 02:33:47,810
Like, I think...

3734
02:33:47,810 --> 02:33:52,390
If I hadn't turned around and seen the lady walking through my house, I wouldn't have seen her.

3735
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:53,970
And...

3736
02:33:55,430 --> 02:33:58,690
A little bit of it was more subtle, for sure.

3737
02:33:58,870 --> 02:33:59,610
I think.

3738
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:01,490
Yeah, it gets in your head.

3739
02:34:01,630 --> 02:34:02,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3740
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:05,070
I thought there'd be more random scares like this.

3741
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:05,830
Like, mortuary assistant.

3742
02:34:06,210 --> 02:34:07,910
But it's actually more comfy than I thought.

3743
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:09,270
Yeah...

3744
02:34:10,970 --> 02:34:11,350
Comfy.

3745
02:34:11,550 --> 02:34:12,230
I guess we'll see...

3746
02:34:12,230 --> 02:34:13,210
This is just the demo.

3747
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:15,170
So we'll see how the full version ends up being.

3748
02:34:16,970 --> 02:34:17,350
Because...

3749
02:34:18,210 --> 02:34:18,590
Um...

3750
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:19,150
Could be.

3751
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,190
Could be...

3752
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:21,850
Could be...

3753
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:22,390
Could be!

3754
02:34:22,490 --> 02:34:22,950
We don't know.

3755
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:28,870
But from what I saw of other people playing it, the demo seems promising, you know?

3756
02:34:28,970 --> 02:34:29,970
So I was just like, okay.

3757
02:34:30,390 --> 02:34:31,450
I do want to try this.

3758
02:34:31,470 --> 02:34:31,710
And!

3759
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:32,730
Um...

3760
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:33,590
Hold on.

3761
02:34:33,590 --> 02:34:35,490
I wonder if it's like your options.

3762
02:34:35,730 --> 02:34:35,950
Look!

3763
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:37,990
There's so many different languages!

3764
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:44,430
Yeah, there's so many different languages.

3765
02:34:44,750 --> 02:34:47,630
I think more people will... lots of people can play.

3766
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:55,820
Hopefully I get to flesh out my role more in the full game.

3767
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,760
There is no moon language.

3768
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,480
The moon ruins are right here!

3769
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:10,420
But this was fun!

3770
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:15,240
Good place to end it because I gotta get ready to go meet with my friends!

3771
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:17,860
So thank you guys!

3772
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:19,740
I hope you enjoyed the demo.

3773
02:35:19,820 --> 02:35:22,760
Whenever it comes out, we'll probably play it.

3774
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:25,380
Maybe not like day one, but eventually.

3775
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:27,180
Oh, let me wishlist it real quick.

3776
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:30,940
Wee, wee, wee.

3777
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:33,180
Wee, hover shuttles.

3778
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:35,260
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

3779
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:35,700
Hold on.

3780
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:37,040
It's trying to play.

3781
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:37,900
Uh-oh.

3782
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:38,740
Uh, guys?

3783
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:39,900
Am I still streaming?

3784
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:41,280
My computer just froze.

3785
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:44,860
Um, actually... Steam just froze?

3786
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:46,720
Uh-oh.

3787
02:35:47,580 --> 02:35:48,020
Okay.

3788
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:48,720
Oh, there it is.

3789
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:50,340
Add to your wishes.

3790
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:53,280
Oh, sorry.

3791
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:54,200
It's playing the trailer.

3792
02:35:55,580 --> 02:35:56,120
Shut up.

3793
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:00,240
Yay!

3794
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:00,680
Okay.

3795
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:03,800
Did I freeze too?

3796
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,300
Freeze!

3797
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:05,860
Hold on.

3798
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:07,400
Let's play Red Light, Green Light.

3799
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:08,780
Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes.

3800
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:11,540
And when I open my eyes, the chat needs to freeze, okay?

3801
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:15,200
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes, you guys can chat.

3802
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:17,280
When I open my eyes, you guys have to freeze, okay?

3803
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:18,280
Okay, okay.

3804
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:21,380
Green Light!

3805
02:36:26,740 --> 02:36:27,380
Red Light.

3806
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:34,320
I think the delay kinda hurts this, doesn't it?

3807
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:35,100
Oh!

3808
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,180
Oh my god, it mostly froze.

3809
02:36:38,180 --> 02:36:41,000
Whoa, it slowed down a ton!

3810
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:41,720
Green Light!

3811
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:46,440
It actually slowed down a ton!

3812
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,420
Green Light!

3813
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:55,180
Green Light!

3814
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:56,160
Green Light!

3815
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:56,680
Green Light!

3816
02:36:56,760 --> 02:36:57,040
Red Light!

3817
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:04,290
We kinda suck at this.

3818
02:37:04,410 --> 02:37:04,830
Yeah, you do.

3819
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:10,940
I like how you guys are boxes.

3820
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:14,600
Boob!

3821
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:15,960
You're out!

3822
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:19,800
Cool.

3823
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,300
No, the chat is supposed to freeze, you guys.

3824
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:27,680
The chat is supposed to freeze.

3825
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:30,960
Anyways, okay.

3826
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:32,800
I'm gonna go get ready and go touch grass.

3827
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:33,620
Thank you guys again!

3828
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:36,360
And I will see you guys tomorrow?

3829
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:38,340
Am I streaming tomorrow?

3830
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,540
I can't remember.

3831
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:40,240
I think I am.

3832
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:41,120
I believe I am.

3833
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:41,960
I think I am.

3834
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:42,880
I believe I am.

3835
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:43,560
I think I am.

3836
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,460
I believe I am.

3837
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:47,280
Yes.

3838
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,580
Oh, I played War of Holocure!

3839
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:49,320
Yippee!

3840
02:37:50,420 --> 02:37:50,900
Okay!

3841
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:52,020
I'll see you!

3842
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:53,100
I'll see you!

3843
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:53,580
I'll see you!

3844
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:55,160
Oh, wait.

3845
02:37:58,140 --> 02:37:59,840
I plan on streaming.

3846
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:01,720
Actually...

3847
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:04,680
So Matara is spending the night?

3848
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:07,640
You might hear Matara tomorrow morning.

3849
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:11,760
Or I guess it will be tomorrow night, right?

3850
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:13,620
Since I stream in the mornings for me.

3851
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,920
But night time for maybe most people watching.

3852
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:16,840
So it...

3853
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:17,400
Yeah.

3854
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:19,500
She's spending the night.

3855
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:23,360
But...

3856
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:23,860
Yeah.

3857
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,360
Okay.

3858
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,160
Anyway, thank you guys!

3859
02:38:26,380 --> 02:38:27,020
Thank you!

3860
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:27,640
Thank you!

3861
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:28,000
Thank you!

3862
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:29,420
I'll see you guys later!

3863
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:31,000
Bye bye!

3864
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:31,960
Bye bye!

3865
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:32,520
Bye bye!

3866
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:33,480
I hope you enjoyed the demo!

3867
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:34,340
Bye bye!

3868
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:34,940
Bye bye!

3869
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:35,380
Bye bye!
