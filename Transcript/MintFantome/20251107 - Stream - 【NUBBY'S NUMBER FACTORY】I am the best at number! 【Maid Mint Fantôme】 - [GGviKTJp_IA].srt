00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,530
Hello everybody!

2
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,750
Hi, hi, hi, I was getting jikki with it and I couldn't stop.

3
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,490
Why is it such a vibe?

4
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,410
Welcome to Nabi's Number Factory!

5
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,030
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

6
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,730
I don't know anything about this game.

7
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,990
I don't even remember how I found it.

8
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,870
I think I was looking for...

9
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,570
I don't remember how I found it.

10
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,890
Who up nubbing their numbers?

11
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,070
Nubby.

12
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,830
Nubby.

13
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,530
Nubby.

14
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,970
We're making numbers, though.

15
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,150
We're making numbers now.

16
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,290
We're making numbers now.

17
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,510
Was it Nimi?

18
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,230
Mm-mm.

19
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,490
No.

20
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,790
I found it on Steam and I was just like, This kind of looks like, uh...

21
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,590
What's the word?

22
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,710
Peggle.

23
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,310
And I was like, I wonder if it's like a peggle.

24
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,150
Nimmy or Northern Lion?

25
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:30,830
Nope.

26
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,570
No, I found it on my own, okay?

27
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,310
Yeah, I thought it looked like peggle.

28
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,710
So I chose it.

29
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,850
But I'm excited.

30
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,070
I've never watched Northern Lion before.

31
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,770
I know Nimmy really likes him, but...

32
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:55,090
all I know is that that guy is bald I don't know anything else about it

33
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,590
I don't know anything about it

34
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:17,790
can we get a ball wait should I pretend to be him today but I don't know anything about him does he have a catchphrase wait hold on I know one We're going north!

35
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,710
Because we're lying it up!

36
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,450
Head north, fellas!

37
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,510
Head north!

38
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,230
Any tips on how to get a cute ghost to haunt somebody asking for a friend?

39
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,990
Uh, you could summon them through the Ouija board?

40
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,510
What do you mean, minus two?

41
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,610
It's just like him.

42
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,470
And he has glasses on also.

43
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,530
And when you summon it goes through the Ouija board.

44
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,370
You have to say...

45
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,030
I offer my body and soul to you.

46
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,190
Please possess me and use my vessel for however you wish.

47
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,250
And also help yourself to...

48
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,210
the cheez-its in the pantry.

49
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,470
That's what you have to say, and then the ghost will stay forever.

50
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,490
But you gotta get like the extra toasted cheez-its.

51
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,770
Agreed?

52
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:33,850
Agreed?

53
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,710
Okay, I'm done being bald now.

54
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,690
You gotta get the extra toasted cheez-its.

55
00:08:44,390 --> 00:09:02,470
Toast stare directly into the camera and say the most deranged hot take off the cuff you think you can just casually say on stream be bald and be a person who visited asia before okay i can be bald i've visited asia what's a hot take i'm

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,640

57
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,230
thoughts on japanese restaurants

58
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,010
why is this harder than i thought it was

59
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,330
I'm done being bald and polio were so simple for us.

60
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,430
Why is this hard?

61
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,150
Hold on.

62
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,210
The bit is over.

63
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,990
No, it's not!

64
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,710
The bit is alive!

65
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,990
The bit is alive!

66
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,090
Japanese restaurants.

67
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,170
You can take me hot to go, Minto.

68
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,050
H-O-T-T-O-T-O.

69
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,490
Why is this so hard?

70
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,170
I can't even make up something.

71
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,250
That like, that like, I...

72
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,450
Like that I don't believe.

73
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,470
But it's just a hot take.

74
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,190
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

75
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,630
Japanese restaurants.

76
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,610
They need more...

77
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,290
I need...

78
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,430
Less fish!

79
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,760
I was so bold.

80
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,880
Only- only I would come up with something so controversial.

81
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm not even like- I'm not even like, oh I gotta be careful because I don't want people to clip this out of context and cancel me.

82
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,280
Like I literally can't think of anything.

83
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,520
Love the new dude.

84
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,140
Oh, thank you!

85
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,340
This is so bald of me.

86
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,900
Needs to be dumber.

87
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,060
We have Japanese restaurants.

88
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,380
Just need to stop being Japanese.

89
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,540
I think they should instead only be hibachi grills.

90
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,740
And if I don't get my choo-choo train onion stack, I think the place is lame.

91
00:12:22,030 --> 00:13:01,670
you guys know what i'm talking about they make like the onion stack and they'll make it into a volcano or something and then they'll be like okay it's a choo-choo train now and they're like they like push it and says it's a choo-choo train let's fish more hot dog i think all restaurants that are not claiming to be american style should also serve burgers and fries no matter what kind of restaurant it is i think that's just uh you know

92
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:14,670
there's no other there's no other meal that should be served every restaurant no matter what kind It is.

93
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,950
It could even be an ice cream parlor.

94
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,030
Meets to serve a burger and fries.

95
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,810
Okay, I'm done being bald for real.

96
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,710
I got one for you.

97
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,310
Japanese restaurants need to give you three chopsticks just in case.

98
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,730
Guess what?

99
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,110
You can get burgers and fries and dairy coins.

100
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:52,990
I think I've only been to Dairy Queen like one time ever They could just mash the sushi into a burger patty and fry it on the grill

101
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:29,930
Get my Michelin star chef who came from Japan From the top world renowned sushi restaurant And he moved to the States To the US of A and he's having to smush together all the fish to make a splendid sushi burger patty and then fry it on the grill wait no not fry grill it up on the grill sashimi no more i'm

102
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:51,900
at the dmv trying to renew my licenses and order a burger and fries combo actually every establishment should be able to serve a fry and burger set more like Gnashi, man.

103
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

104
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,500
You go to the post office?

105
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,060
I'm here to mail my package and get me a double patty.

106
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,220
He had a sushi place, triple wielding chopsticks, like Zoro for one piece.

107
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,080
Burgers at the funeral home?

108
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,460
If I...

109
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,900
If I knew, I would have...

110
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I should have been able to...

111
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,220
Arrange my own funeral.

112
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,380
I would have allowed it.

113
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Did you steal my wallet?

114
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,420
I can't find it.

115
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:26,840
No?

116
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,790
Oh my gosh, would you guys come to my...

117
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,230
Wait, I don't know if I ever got a funeral.

118
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,110
Can I plan one and you guys come to it?

119
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,310
Can I get a sashimi American style?

120
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah, yeah, you would.

121
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,860
You would go.

122
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,500
You would pay your respects.

123
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,680
You would?

124
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
Can we bring cake?

125
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm not...

126
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,440
No.

127
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,880
You're not allowed to eat at my funeral because I can't eat.

128
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,180
I can't eat.

129
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm dead.

130
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,500
Well, I would be dead in the casket.

131
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,700
It would be an open casket.

132
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,760
But don't worry.

133
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,280
My body is like long skeletonized.

134
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,840
So it's probably just a mannequin.

135
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,440
Or...

136
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:39,220
someone can offer to you could either die you could either dress up as me and die or you could stay alive and just you can't move for like seven hours

137
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:59,360
will it be open bar only tomato juice meinto morn and greet what if we cremate the cake I've actually been thinking about how to do this I was like maybe I can I want to have like a...

138
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,100
I was like, I kind of want to set up like a meet-and-greet, but as a funeral.

139
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,640
We'll put you on a TV screen and put the TV screen in the coffin as the meet-and-greet.

140
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

141
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,660
I've been like kind of playing with the idea for real.

142
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,660
Can I do the ending monologue from the end of MGS2?

143
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,880
What does that have to do with me, huh?

144
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Weirdest pitch for the new cosplay sets.

145
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,000
Where there'll be finger sandwiches.

146
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:33,860
No.

147
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,220
Putting the fun in funeral.

148
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
Revolving sushi in funeral.

149
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,140
Danny, the cosplayer.

150
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,280
She's so cute.

151
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,000
Just put the numbers in the factory, mate.

152
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah, we should play the game.

153
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Sorry, I'm just yapping.

154
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,780
I don't know anything about this game, so I'm excited.

155
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,260
to help me out.

156
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,900
Excited for you to help me out.

157
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
Also, I've been drinking an energy...

158
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,480
I was so tired.

159
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
So I got an energy...

160
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
It's not a drink.

161
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,640
It's...

162
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,580
It was like...

163
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,300
Not a smoothie.

164
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,620
That's the thing.

165
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,380
Not a shot.

166
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,040
No.

167
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,700
Not an enema, no.

168
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
Like a...

169
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,140
Not a milkshake.

170
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,280
Burgers and fries at the funeral?

171
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,620
Put the fries in the bang.

172
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,660
Like, why?

173
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,800
Like a slushy!

174
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,680
A slushy!

175
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,420
That's the word.

176
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,140
A energy slushy.

Oh, he's really happy.

182
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,820
First things first, welcome aboard to Nubby's number factory.

183
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
The world's leading number manufacturer.

184
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,060
This is the main control center of the factory.

185
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,700
Your first task is to launch our mascot Nubby down the pegboard.

186
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,360
Hold down right mouse and press left mouse to launch Nubby.

187
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,900
I'm sending him in So I can't speak.

188
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,780
Oh, I forgot to press left.

189
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh, he doesn't bounce.

190
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,040
Well, you're really good at this.

191
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,880
At this factory, your only job is to make big numbers.

192
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,220
I'm a cinnamon.

193
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm a cinnamon down.

194
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,700
I like his glasses.

195
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,740
What about mine?

196
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,220
You like my glasses?

197
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,140
and you like my glasses

198
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,090
sorry but they're crooked

199
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:32,340
were you waiting to do that yeah i paid that chatter to send that message so that i could do them

200
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,880
Yeah, I was just like, okay, at 7.21 p.m.

201
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,940
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

202
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,140
By launching Nubby at these pegs, you will earn however many points are shown on the peg.

203
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,000
That's what Northern Lion would say.

204
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,200
You can keep yapping.

205
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Oh, yay!

206
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
This number shows how many points you have.

207
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,000
You made it in a round.

208
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,260
The number on the bottom is the goal.

209
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,080
If you beat the goal, the board will restock.

210
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,440
If you get really high score, the board can restock multiple times in a single round.

211
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,520
Oh, what?

212
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,180
I forgot to tell you what a restock even is!

213
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,580
Well, listen up, because restocks are the buying thing!

214
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,300
Oh my gosh.

215
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,320
When the board restocks a bunch of new pegs will fall from the sky and fill all your empty spaces.

216
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh.

217
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,320
Northern Lion Mint Collab win.

218
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,460
I don't deserve that at all.

219
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,400
If anything, Nimmy Nightmare should have Northern Lion Collab.

220
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,380
I don't even know this guy.

221
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,000
Soon after pairs of pegs with the same number will merge into the one grid or peg.

222
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,260
Let's try it out.

223
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,240
Keep launching Nubby until you beat the goal.

224
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,620
Okay.

225
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,440
So like Oh, shoot.

226
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,980
I keep forgetting to press the...

227
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,700
Whoa!

228
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,400
Pegtacular!

229
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
That was peg-alicious.

230
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,020
You're a star.

231
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,360
Just kidding.

232
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,200
No, you're not.

233
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Okay, we're almost done.

234
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,140
To rearrange your new pegs, press the jumbo button.

235
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,880
Whoa.

236
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,420
Nice.

237
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,280
Launch Nubby one more time.

238
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,240
Whoa!

239
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:39,920
Whoa!

240
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,080
Oh, gosh.

241
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,080
Oh, geez.

242
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,960
I can already feel myself.

243
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,480
getting addicted to this, you know.

244
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,620
You may have noticed that Nubi goes through some pegs, but not through others.

245
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,500
Nubi will break through ones, but will bounce off any peg greater than one.

246
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Alright, bud, that's it for the tutorial.

247
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,200
You'll figure out the rest for yourself.

248
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,120
Smiley face.

249
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,760
Oh!

250
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,420
Hey!

251
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,420
I forgot it's on one thing!

252
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,240
Every time you launch Nubi, you lose one life.

253
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,780
If you run out of lives, the sun will explode!

254
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,640
But luckily, every time the board restocks, you get one life back.

255
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,340
So as long as you keep making big numbers, Nobody gets hurt.

256
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,080
Okay, I'm done.

257
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,140
Thanks for not pressing the skip tutorial button.

258
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,540
I know that was difficult for you.

259
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,780
I'll start you off with a fresh new factory now.

260
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,380
Good luck!

261
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh, we're at the factory.

262
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,640
Zone 1!

263
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,800
Oh my gosh.

264
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,640
Sonic the Hedgehog.

265
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,360
2!

266
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,960
We'll go.

267
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,780
We'll go this way.

268
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah, big number.

269
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,460
big number?

270
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

271
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,500
And then you can...

272
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,640
Oh, okay, so you can only shuffle one.

273
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,540
Oops.

274
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,220
Wait, I hit the goal.

275
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,780
I haven't lived till now.

276
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,820
I cannot believe Min Tandem is playing my favorite game.

277
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,740
No, it's No Bavaccarer!

278
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,980
Wait, this is...

279
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,400
Oh, yeah, baby.

280
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
Oh, yeah, baby.

281
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,260
What is he doing there?

282
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,780
Is he tracking my progress?

283
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,840
So this is like Peggle.

284
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,200
It is like...

285
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
I guess so.

286
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,260
Whoa.

287
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,380
16?

288
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,680
Uh-oh.

289
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:21,940
Uh-oh.

290
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,440
Dang it.

291
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,300
That was not good.

292
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,540
That was not good.

293
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,340
Team.

294
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,020
Team.

295
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,140
We need to lock in.

296
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,100
Whoa.

297
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,860
Nubi-Nubi-Mart.

298
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,420
There's items!

299
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,800
Rogue-like Peggle.

300
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,020
Wait, that's kind of awesome.

301
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,580
Click an item to drag and drop it into your inventory.

302
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,740
Press right to sell them.

303
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,220
Oh, let's see.

304
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,960
Okay, we got...

305
00:25:43,980 --> 00:26:16,780
glasses highest number peg popped pops two random pegs pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro pedro nubby hits wall pops one random peg crazy straw 10 wait what was this one disguised glasses Summons one straw that pops one peg.

306
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,360
Pegs popped by straws give an additional...

307
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,700
Wait, how much do I even have?

308
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
I have five gold.

309
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,760
I can't...

310
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,420
I can't buy any of this.

311
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,760
What does this do?

312
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
This is that...

313
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,700
This is like...

314
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,660
Oh, they're called the...

315
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,480
The bears or something, right?

316
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,980
Oh, oh, this is five gold for one item slot.

317
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

318
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,320
I have nine.

319
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,900
Okay, okay.

320
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,960
Water bear!

321
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,620
25% chance to double one random peg.

324
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,180
The freeze block allows you to save one item for later purchase.

325
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,520
Okay, I was wondering if this would either let you do that or like freeze the whole thing.

326
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,180
Rare item odds, 5%.

327
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,760
Well, how do I know if something's rare?

328
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,240
Will it glow?

329
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,400
So wait, summons one straw that pops one peg.

330
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,360
Pegs popped by straw gives an additional 10% of their number.

331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,220
Gains 5% every time you've jumbled pegs in the game.

332
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
Wait, that sounds kind of good, though, no?

333
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
By color, maybe.

334
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,270
Well, I guess we'll see.

335
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,410
Doesn't that sound kind of good?

336
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,470
It's apparent it's rare.

337
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,110
Okay, okay, okay.

338
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,390
It has some scaling.

339
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,370
Yeah, and it might be good early game.

340
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,630
Oh.

341
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,650
Oh, interesting.

342
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,190
Okay, so this is what the slots are up here for.

343
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,250
So we have, we can get max seven items.

344
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,710
Nice, okay.

345
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,980
I played Peggle, guys.

346
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,720
I played Peggle.

347
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
I beat Peggle.

348
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,800
My good friend Emma has been wanting to get into Blue Archive, and he said this last push was needed.

349
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,160
It's coming, or she's telling to do so, so please convince him.

350
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,040
Why wouldn't you hop on Blue Archive?

351
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,840
Why wouldn't you hop on Blue Archive?

352
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,340
Special round!

353
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,780
Sneaky snipers!

354
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,740
Hover over to see the details.

355
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,560
What is it?

356
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,440
I'm hovering?

357
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,780
What's the details?

358
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,700
Hello?

359
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,420
I'm hovering?

360
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,130
Oh,

361
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,200
you needed to hover over the...

362
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,700
Oh, okay.

363
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Oops.

364
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,780
My bad.

365
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,420
I don't know what just happened.

366
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,020
But it was awesome.

367
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Wait.

368
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,380
I need to restart.

369
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,960
I need to start doing this because.

370
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,440
Because of the straw.

371
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,400
I got loot.

372
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,720
Is this a red?

373
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh!

374
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,780
The tornado perk.

375
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,840
Force triggers the leftmost item.

376
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,740
Items.

377
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Jumbling pegs.

378
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Increases X by plus 2.

379
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,180
This value resets after each round.

380
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,480
What is up with me playing like these kind of rope?

381
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,730
games, the clover pit, I'm just...

382
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,720
Force triggers all non-upgraded items.

383
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,900
I think we should go for this.

384
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,480
Very cute.

385
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,120
Oh, that didn't... Okay.

386
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
Maybe it's fine.

387
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,260
What was it again?

388
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,850
It was like...

389
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,860
It gives initial...

390
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,080
Wait.

391
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:24,200

392
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,200

393
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,340
No!

394
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,900
No!

395
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:35,980
No!

396
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,480
Always be chaplain!

397
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,500
Hold on, I want to see if I can bounce it off the wall.

398
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,100
Oh, I can.

399
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,500
Okay.

400
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,200
That was really bad.

401
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,330
What if it's jumbling with a G?

402
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,410
A, B, G.

403
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,650
Always be gumbling.

404
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,330
Flamethrower.

405
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,050
A random peg will explode.

406
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,710
Wait, I want this.

407
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,570
I want that.

408
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,630
Pops the lowest number peg twice.

409
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,690
Nice save.

410
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,590
Thank you.

411
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,970
Always be gambling.

412
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:58,490
YouTube don't listen don't listen I hate gambling oh no I've never gambled ever before in my afterlife I hate it I hate it I get the rocks this the ton of no this is a feather that's not a rock it's literally a feather no gambling wait

413
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,470
Um, gosh, I can't get over this guy because it moves so crazy.

414
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:17,150
Uh, I wonder if I should save for the flamethrower because this seems pretty good to pop random pegs nearby, I think.

415
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,130
He's so wiggly.

416
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,570
Pedro loves you, you should get him.

417
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,990
You can sell the straw!

418
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,150
What I'll do is I'll freeze.

419
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,630
Oh, drag and drop an item over this button to freeze them.

420
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,070
Frozen items won't go away when you re-roll or leave the shop.

421
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,630
I think I should do it.

422
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,370
Does Flamethrower add those points, though?

423
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,410
I assume.

424
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,570
Right?

425
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,690
Is that what it means?

426
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,130
Bejo, bejo, bejo, bejo.

427
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,230
Use it, it's free.

428
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:01,510
Okay.

429
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,830
Frozen.

430
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,730
We'll save, we'll save.

431
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,890
This is really making me want to play pebble.

432
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,650
I'm not going to lie.

433
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,090
Oh, icky.

434
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,290
Crappy.

435
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,790
Oh, nice.

436
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,190
Oh, yeah.

437
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,130
Good, good, good.

438
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,470
Not icky, crappy.

439
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,250
Better.

440
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,450
Okay, I'm going to bounce off the wall.

441
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,750
Oh, no.

442
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,590
Nice, nice, nice.

443
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,470
Oh, yeah!

444
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,870
Oh, okay.

445
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,010
Hover over this to see...

446
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:36,170
Okay.

447
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,830
This peg will pop the highest number peg when popped.

448
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,310
Will not pop itself.

449
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,110
Okay, okay, okay.

450
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,830
So...

451
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,650
Oh.

452
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,110
Ah.

453
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,010
I think I messed up.

454
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,010
Oh, my gosh!

455
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,290
Wait, I only have the sun's about to explode!

456
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,130
Wait, guys!

457
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,570
I think we're in trouble.

458
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,390
Last shot!

459
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,720
Wait, but I thought it did every time it restocked or whatever.

460
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,080
Am I...

461
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
The sun isn't gonna explode.

462
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,020
It's blown!

463
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:24,840
Oh.

464
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,800
It was a good first run, was it?

465
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,580
You are awesome.

466
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,940
Lerker here, hi!

467
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,200
That the grumpy ghost bro on your outfit is really great and I dream of maybe being like a squishy pin or tiny plushy of it someday.

468
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,260
Yes, you're pretty good, too.

469
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,560
Please take care and enjoy your time off in November.

470
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,160
Zimbabwe!

471
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,220
Thank you.

472
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,320
This guy is really wobbly, isn't he?

473
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,320
At least I have some jiggles on me.

474
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,140
Nah.

475
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,570
Wait, but why did I die?

476
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,130
if it was restocking.

477
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:09,730
Oh.

478
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,030
Oh, wow.

479
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,270
That was horrible.

480
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,810
Oh.

481
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,250
Guys, this is really bad.

482
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,470
Wait, this is so bad.

483
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,130
You get one extra shot per restock.

484
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,530
Oh, maybe I was just wasting them too much.

485
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,870
Not a great peggler.

486
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,270
Oh, I'm the best ever Do it, please!

487
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,710
Believe me!

488
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,750
Believe me!

489
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,190
Now be more...

490
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,870
Ooh, squirmie.

491
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,230
Gives plus five points for every time this item has triggered during the round.

492
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,050
One in 50 chance to metamorphosize.

493
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,050
What does he trigger?

494
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,530
Uranium rod.

495
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,930
Always be reshuffling.

496
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:27,590
Nubi Emits a burst of nuclear waste Nuclear waste pops any pegs it touches If Nubi isn't alive, a random peg What do you mean if Nubi isn't alive?

497
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:41,210
I want to try the rod, though Seems cool If Nubi's not alive Don't you even mean this car?

498
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,170
Nubi could die The peg

499
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,770
with the high...

500
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,310
Okay, okay, okay.

501
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,430
So it's like...

502
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,050
Please, pop!

503
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,430
Pop!

504
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,050
No!

505
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,110
Nobody dies when he reaches the bottom.

506
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,990
Oh, that's what they mean.

507
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,470
That's so sad.

508
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,470
I got loot.

509
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,850
We got the speedy perk.

510
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,910
If the round started less than 1.5 seconds ago, force triggers the item slots in the one.

511
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:27,710
Okay.

512
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,090
Force triggers the leftmost item in your inventory.

513
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,750
I think I'll skip.

514
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,310
It gives me gold.

515
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,070
Unless, I guess I could move stuff around.

516
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,510
I guess I could get the speedy perk and, like, move things as I get them, maybe.

517
00:37:53,250 --> 00:38:06,110
perks are usually good you'll keep the money oh Oscar am I that quick though I can be I'll be quick

518
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:23,030
we got pants oh my gosh I got two flamethrowers mom lets me have two sorry two pants This is not strike witches.

519
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,370
Pops a random peg.

520
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,350
When this peg pops, it gives a points twice.

521
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,210
That sounds like a tongue twister and all.

522
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,510
Pops a random peg.

523
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,810
When this peg pops, it gives points twice.

524
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,830
Pops a random peg.

525
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,050
When this peg pops, it gives points twice.

526
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,010
Pops a random peg.

527
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,230
When this peg pops, it gives points twice.

528
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,110
Wait, that's actually...

529
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,350
That's kind of good, actually, no?

530
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
What's the kazoo?

531
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,450
Doubles a random peg?

532
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,750
We already have the uranium rod, so I feel like it's kind of similar to...

533
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,070
Well, maybe not.

534
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,970
I don't know.

535
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,910
She'd be spitting.

536
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,190
Pops a random peg.

537
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,570
When this peg pops, it gives points twice.

538
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,430
I'm surprised you even know what pants are, Minto.

539
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,270
I wasn't born yesterday.

540
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,250
I died yesterday.

541
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,330
When's the funeral?

542
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,170
I'm gonna try the pants.

543
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,430
Pants.

544
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,670
Yuck.

545
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,350
Oh, whoa, whoa.

546
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,090
Okay.

547
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,250
Well, how many points are we at?

548
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,550
I wonder.

549
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,790
Compared to last time, you know?

550
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,910
Okay.

551
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,110
Sneaky snipers!

552
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,790
Oh, they're all the way down there!

553
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,770
Wait, we can refresh?

554
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,490
Wait, no, that sucks!

555
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:10,130
Wait!

556
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,550
Woo!

557
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,070
Woo!

558
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:12,790
Wait!

559
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,590
Oh!

560
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,510
Good run.

561
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:16,690
Yes?

562
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,690
Why are we saying yes?

563
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,270
Oh, I don't mean to be rude.

564
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,590
I don't mean to be rude, but what are you?

565
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,210
Are you an elf?

566
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,610
A ghost?

567
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,670
A maid?

568
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,230
A nerd?

569
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,390
Did you just say nerd?

570
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:55,130
That's one of Lives and Afterlives Tough choices, tough questions What are we If I am but a ghost mid Nerd elf What are you?

571
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,050
What do you desire to be?

572
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,120
If you can think it, you can be it.

573
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:23,940
If you want to be a little crab that makes those holes in the sand when the water is wet and it's kind of like bubbling a little bit, you could do it.

574
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,030
inspirational.

575
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,490
Get me on TED Talk.

576
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:34,910
Why?

577
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,250
Who?

578
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,850
Who is TED anyway?

579
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,950
And why do I have to listen to him?

580
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:41,690
Huh?

581
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,670
I don't get it.

582
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,930
I don't get that guy.

583
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,350
I don't know him.

584
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,590
Oh, no!

585
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,890
That was so bad!

586
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,730
No!

587
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,990
Maybe here?

588
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,190
Come on!

589
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:58,830
Come on!

590
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,150
Yeah!

591
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,950
Yeah!

592
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,110
The Gravitron!

593
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,890
It's only six gold, which I try.

594
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,030
Why is Ted talking?

595
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,470
And why do we listen to him?

596
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:16,890
Key?

597
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,110
Go for the key?

598
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,930
Caffeinated Minto's mind is too powerful.

599
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,590
We must become fiddler crabs and take down Ted and cease his talking.

600
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,950
Beep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

601
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,590
When opened, receive a suspicious key.

602
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,250
Suspicious key on the next shop turn, you will gain access to the black market.

603
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,890
You guys are telling me to do illegal activities.

604
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,890
Nah, welcome to membership.

605
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:48,650
Thank you.

606
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,970
If I live to see the day of the black market.

607
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,780
Oh, okay, good.

608
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
Sneaky snipers.

609
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,000
Sneaky sniper.

610
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,680
Sneaky sniper.

611
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,080
Oh, oh, oh.

612
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,530
Oh, was that?

613
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,870
I don't think that was good, was it?

614
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,630
Oh, geez.

615
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,230
Oh, geez.

616
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:28,730
Oh, geez.

617
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,210
Oh, geez.

618
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,530
Oh, geez.

619
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,530
I'm using the key.

620
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,830
Oh, snub.

621
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,590
Clarity.

622
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,070
My cat has like a nub-tail.

623
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,530
So when you say that, it makes me think of my cat.

624
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:49,950
Alien.

625
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,810
What does she alien?

626
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,770
A random peg amidst a cosmoblast.

627
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,950
When a peg is popped by a cosmoblast, it counts as two pegs popped instead of one.

628
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:02,630
Putaroya.

629
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,630
Yeah, he's got a little nub-tail.

630
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,850
Flibby flobbies.

631
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,410
the item to the left of me wants.

632
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,910
Oh, so it is, like, where you can rearrange these, okay.

633
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,270
Oh, man.

634
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,430
Oh, mannequin head.

635
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,250
I was close.

636
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,350
Reduces round gold by... 30%!

637
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,790
Wait, but it's corrupted.

638
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,630
This item cannot be forced triggered.

639
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,450
Halfs all pegs.

640
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,190
Oh, that's not good, though.

641
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,450
This one is rare.

642
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,900
The yellow text is the trigger for items, by the way.

643
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,780
Oh, I see it.

644
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,360
I see it.

645
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,160
Two pegs doubled.

646
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,500
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

647
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,800
All perks force triggered the item to the left of me.

648
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,100
But it's rare, so I want to get it.

649
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,760
Flippy flobbies.

650
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,100
Oh, I could reroll.

651
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,120
Because flippy flobbies...

652
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,080
Wouldn't even account for these, you know?

653
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,940
I don't know.

654
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,620
The rare is really good, is it?

655
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,320
Okay, I'll get the fluby-flubbers.

656
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,220
Pleasure doing business with you.

657
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,560
Power outage.

658
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,080
This peg will disable a random item when fully popped.

659
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,660
Disabled items cannot trigger for the rest of the round.

660
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,260
Sorry.

661
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,940
Oh my god!

662
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,860
Don't do it.

663
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,220
Oh, that was so close.

664
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,840
Holy cow.

665
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,040
I got loot.

666
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Cheese.

667
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,740
The cheesy perk.

668
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,980
Force triggers all items.

669
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,140
Nubby dies.

670
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,640
Force triggers all Nubby dies items again.

671
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
I think maybe this one.

672
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,940
The cheesy perk.

673
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,460
Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese.

674
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,220
Squeak, squeak.

675
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,240
We made it to zone two.

676
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,620
The stratosphere.

677
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,580
Oh my gosh, I've been there before!

678
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,920
Uh-oh.

679
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,220
Team.

680
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,840
This might be it.

681
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,240
Oh!

682
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,340
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

683
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,960
Oh, golly!

684
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,940
It's too much pressure!

685
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,600
Stay

686
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:30,330
in love Stay in love Poop butt For every time the board has restocked this game Gain 15 points Summons a sharp shot That will pop a random peg Ten times Monstrosity Wait what is this one?

687
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:43,310
Jax If Nubby is still alive Summon a meat orb That will float around and pop pegs Meat orb dies when Nabi dies.

688
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,650
Jack's to the left of your rare item is busted.

689
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,250
Oh, let's try it.

690
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,450
Okay, I'll try it.

691
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,990
I just believed you.

692
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,150
Could you say Pico is the best?

693
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,450
He's my dog.

694
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,710
I just believed you.

695
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,650
I just believed you.

696
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,230
Come on, last shot!

697
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,150
Never be game over!

698
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,130
Good job, team.

699
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,880
That was pretty good.

700
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:49,840
Good job.

701
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,740
Good job, everybody.

702
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,180
Whoa, so many restocks.

703
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,440
Maybe I'm good at this game.

704
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,420
Oh,

705
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,700
we have some new characters.

706
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,580
Creative upload!

707
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,360
I hope you're having a nubbatastic day.

708
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,800
Not quite how I would imagine the sun exploding.

709
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,900
What is this guy?

710
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,120
Finger puppet.

711
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,500
Nubby gives points equal to the number of times that Nubby has bounced this round.

712
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,180
Okay.

713
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,360
We could go back with the uranium rod.

714
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,160
That is reroll free.

715
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,190
Reroll is free once per store.

716
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,130
I'm gonna reroll.

717
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:10,630
Wow!

718
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,710
Flame in skull!

719
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,250
20...

720
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:14,970
Nubby dies.

721
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,110
10% chance to cause a giant explosion that pops all pegs at once.

722
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,390
40% chance if you are on your last shot.

723
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:22,730
Whoa!

724
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,550
Sun exploding.

725
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,030
What is this?

726
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,990
Outer wilds?

727
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,090
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

728
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,270
Not a lot, though.

729
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:33,850
C.

730
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,450
Cucumber.

731
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:41,230
Every empty peg space will give points equal to the amount of total pegs that have been popped in this row.

732
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,230
PPS!

733
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,610
Like, you're pretty good in my last donut was meant to be an oscillating.

734
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,470
Yeah, I know.

735
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:53,310
PPS.

736
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,470
You're actually really great.

737
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:56,130
Two.

738
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,070
Thank you!

739
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,450
Thank you so much.

740
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,170
Broken socket.

741
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,490
Item to the right of me triggers.

742
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,270
25% to create a chain bolt that pops a cluster of pegs.

743
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,470
Oh, but there's nothing to the right of the broken socket that would trigger.

744
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:19,970
So...

745
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,760
Maybe a meat orb.

746
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,880
Yeah, too early for it.

747
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,780
Let's try the meat orb.

748
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,980
Let's just see how he works.

749
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,420
Seems kind of fun.

750
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,580
Whoa!

751
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,380
Oh wow, that sucked.

752
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,020
Gold Rush, this peg will give plus one coin when popped for the first time.

753
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,600
I work a nine to five now!

754
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,500
Old username!

755
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,230
Oh, seven.

756
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,070
Get that, make that, make that.

757
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,130
Sweet, sweet cash, though, you know?

758
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,450
Is he actually doing anything?

759
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,110
Ooh, we got loot.

760
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,130
We got Force Trigger all X-Pegs popped items.

761
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,830
Nubby dies.

762
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,670
Force Trigger's all first-Pegs popped items.

763
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:40,190
Wait, what?

764
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,690
Oh, I have neither.

765
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,550
Maybe the Nubby dies because that is a given.

766
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:58,290
Well, I guess 15 pegs popped would also maybe be a given, but...

767
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,580
Rip nubby.

768
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,260
Skipper, you think so?

769
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,280
Zombie.

770
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,340
Zombie seems dope.

771
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,860
I lost my job, you don't!

772
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,220
Yeah!

773
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,350
Money is important early on.

774
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:38,730
Okay, I'm going to skip this one.

775
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,850
It might be against my better judgment, but...

776
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,650
You know what I always say?

777
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,730
This is a classic phrase from classic Minto.

778
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,850
OG Minto.

779
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,470
Way, way back in 2020.

780
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,750
People last.

781
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:04,330
I bleep.

782
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,160
It's real.

783
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
So inspired.

784
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,200
Mm-hmm.

785
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,340
Wise words.

786
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:21,840
Mm-hmm.

787
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,700
And that's a rock fact.

788
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,080
Let's see.

789
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,240
I gotta get Pedro, maybe.

790
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,040
Or the flamethrower.

791
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,940
Every one second.

792
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,740
Wait.

793
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,660
Can I get more than one item at a time?

794
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,520
Jax is good.

795
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,060
Guys, that was terrible.

796
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,120
Whoa!

797
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,840
Whoa!

798
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,700
Oh, wait.

799
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,920
Maybe I can bounce off.

800
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,250
There we go.

802
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,680
Gold Rush!

803
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:22,520
You.

804
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,420
I think I got it.

805
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,280
Did I?

806
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,330
Wait, I'm not making...

807
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,070
Oh my gosh.

808
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,090
Oh.

809
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:43,710
there we go wait oh my gosh no i didn't make it at all wait this sucks uh-oh team this might be it

810
00:55:50,950 --> 00:56:01,670
no okay don't buy both don't buy both actually wait

811
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:13,250
she killed the song I'm going to hell and I'm taking you with me!

812
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,190
What a happy seal!

813
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,370
Two random pegs get smacked.

814
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,930
When a peg is smacked, it counts as a peg halved.

815
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,250
Trigger without actually halving.

816
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:30,330
Hal- hal- hal- halving it.

817
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,770
Hell with me, though!

818
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,310
Yippee!

819
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,190
I don't know what but it is but listening to you makes me feel very relaxed today.

820
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,670
My brain feels smooth as a minto's bottom.

821
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,650
My bottom is really smooth.

822
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,650
I lotion it every day.

823
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,130
There's a song by Leve that I really like.

824
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,370
That's it's kind of cute because it's like.

825
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,750
How does it go?

826
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,690
If I like hear it obviously I know.

827
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,690
Oh it's called like the silver it's called silver lining.

828
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:16,590
It's really cute because it's like.

829
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:23,930
Like, you know, we're being baddies, but if I'm going to hell, the silver lining is that I'm going to hell with you, baby.

830
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,070
So cute.

831
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,790
Jarvis, clip that.

832
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,030
I'm going to go.

833
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,510
Oh, maybe I will go for the feathers this time.

834
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,770
Or the rod.

835
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:46,070
I feel like the uranium rod helped us a lot before, so maybe...

836
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,190
Would you recommend putting lotion on booties?

837
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,630
I lotion everywhere.

838
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:52,990
You should lotion everywhere.

839
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,350
The old Lave lotion bottom song.

840
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:58,990
I'm familiar.

841
00:57:59,630 --> 00:57:59,990
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,990
Uranium, my favorite.

843
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:02,910
I think so, too.

844
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,090
I think I like it also.

845
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,280
Phew!

846
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,120
Oh, nice, nice.

847
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,360
Oh, yeah, baby.

848
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:19,820
Yeah, baby.

849
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,900
Cool restock too.

850
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,400
Restock too.

851
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:22,900
Restock.

852
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,760
Come on, come on.

853
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,660
Get back in there.

854
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,040
Come on.

855
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,940
There we go.

856
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,460
Kaizel, welcome to Mambusha.

857
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,340
Thank you.

858
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,920
Thank you so much.

859
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,780
Thank you.

860
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,760
Oh, the sound effects in this game are great, though.

862
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,580
Let's see what we got here.

863
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,060
We got the springy perk.

864
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:49,100
5% chance to force trigger item in slot 5, which I do not have unlocked.

865
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,080
The archaic perk.

866
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,900
Force triggers all non-unlocked.

867
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,200
Upgraded items.

868
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,420
Well, I have no...

869
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,260
Numbers are hard.

870
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,300
Yeah.

871
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,350
I just hate the feel of lotion at first.

872
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,170
I do it right after I get out of the shower.

873
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,290
So I'm still kind of like...

874
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:13,470
You know, I'm still a little damp from the shower.

875
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:17,490
And then I just stand there naked while the lotion dries.

876
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,550
I sometimes move my body like this.

877
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,490
To help.

878
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,870
With my arms out.

879
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,070
I become like a windmill.

880
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,000
Air drawing.

881
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,510
What should I... I don't know.

882
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,710
I feel like this one probably helps us in the short term.

883
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,690
Which is dumb.

884
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:54,570
You should never...

885
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,290
You should always be thinking long term.

886
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,070
But what the hell?

887
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,430
Oh, lobster claw.

888
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:02,490
Every item in your inventory gives points equal to a random peg's number.

889
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,310
Well, we can't afford it, though.

890
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,190
Oh, my gosh, Cheese House!

891
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,850
Wait, there's so many friends here.

892
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,140
I like you as a friend.

893
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,060
I'm glad!

894
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,560
We're just, we're just bros.

895
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,220
Oh, I can freeze it.

896
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:22,660
You're right.

897
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,160
You're right.

898
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,360
What is this?

899
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,880
Nubby dies gained 300 points.

900
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,680
If you were on round 30 or higher, gained 3,000 points instead.

901
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,080
That could be life or death.

902
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,480
Nubi hits wall twice.

903
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,500
Doubles four random pegs whose number is less than 32.

904
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,020
Wait, huh?

905
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,380
Wait.

906
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,520
Doubles four random pegs whose number...

907
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Oh, okay.

908
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,400
Cheesehouse is early carry.

909
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,540
If I get this, though, would I be able...

910
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,400
If I freeze you...

911
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,560
Can I freeze it again?

912
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:04,440
Can I freeze it again?

913
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,740
Can I freeze it?

914
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,040
More than once.

915
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,820
Oh, two, three!

916
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,660

917
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,140

01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,140
Okay, these are the guys.

01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,870
Oh, yeah, we got it.

Nice.

01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,270
I will be buying this game.

933
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,150
It's great!

934
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:02,990
This is awesome!

935
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,290
Oh, no, no, no, no.

936
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,030
Oh, no, no.

937
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,650
Oh, we made it.

938
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:11,750
We made it.

939
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,310
We made it.

940
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,950
Wait, but...

941
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,210
What about...

942
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,950
What about the other...

943
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,410
What about the lobster claw?

944
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,410
It stays frozen, it does.

945
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,570
It's still there.

946
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,960
Lopter.

947
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,640
Wingless fly.

948
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,660
If the first peg popped is the highest number peg, multiply total score by 2.5.

949
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,900
Wait, that's kind of good.

950
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,580
Snake.

951
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,720
Ouroboros.

952
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,020
Wait!

953
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:55,720
Snake!

954
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,720
Jake the snake!

955
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,660
One and two chance to double all pegs.

956
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:02,760
Mm-hmm.

957
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,040
Amidst one...

958
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,560
Echors?

959
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,340
Ech.

960
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,980
I-core.

961
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:11,740
I-core.

962
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,540
Twin snakes.

963
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,080
You love Jake.

964
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,920
One and two chance to double all pegs.

965
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,680
I feel like this guy is kind of good though.

966
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:43,380
too though no oh it's the first peg popped oh my gosh wait that'd be crazy but i think we should go for jake wait everybody likes jake we're going for jake ikker ikker

967
01:04:50,410 --> 01:05:03,170
jake is huge jake's our man jake jake he's our man if we can't do it whoa oh Boss round!

968
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,570
This peg will kill Nubi and end the round when fully popped!

969
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:11,410
Not good.

970
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,790
Not cool.

971
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,510
Not cool.

972
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,930
Not cool.

973
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,430
Not cool.

974
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,850
Oh my gosh!

975
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,910
How do we do it?

976
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,490
Mystery box perk.

977
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:30,490
If slot 1 is empty, a random item from Nubi Mart will appear in slot 1 and force trigger 3 times!

978
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,730
The new item will disappear at the end of the round.

979
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,230
Nubby almost died for real, you guys.

980
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,370
Force triggers all items every three seconds.

981
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,660
Cheese is better here, mystery is good way early.

982
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:54,210
I guess that's true.

983
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,090
We're back to the stratosphere!

984
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,780
Okay we're making it, we're making it.

985
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,260
Ish.

986
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:20,760
Oh, gosh.

987
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,260
Oh, okay, okay.

988
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,280
Corrupted items like Jake can't be forced triggered, though.

989
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,840
He's been doing a good job at his job, though.

990
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,360
He's been doing a good job.

991
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,460
Good job, Jake.

992
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,380
Good job, Jake.

993
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,080
Oh!

994
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,140
Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to unlock the item slot, and we're going to buy

995
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,700
the lobster Claw.

996
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,900
Five pegs pop.

997
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,020
Summons one quill that falls from the sky and pops one peg.

998
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,320
Oh, I can upgrade!

999
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,620
Ooh, white cheese.

1000
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,600
13 fonts!

1001
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,720
Thank you!

1002
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,220
Thank you, thank you!

1003
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,000
Move Jake out of three.

1004
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:17,600
Why?

1005
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,850
Moldy cheese.

1006
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,250
No Swiss cheese.

1007
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,830
We're cheesing it up.

1008
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,450
Re-roll, let's try it.

1009
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:31,930
Whoa!

1010
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:32,990
Oh my gosh.

1011
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:36,290
If only I had enough money, I could make it crazy.

1012
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,660
I could make it go crazy if we could do all three.

1013
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,940
Can buy one and freeze the other, but it's true.

1014
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:00,570
Minto!

1015
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,530
Thank you!

1016
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,690
Thank you so much!

1017
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,890
I think it's okay, though.

1018
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,430
Well, I don't know.

1019
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,610
I feel like getting upgrades at this point is probably pretty good, I think.

1020
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,370
Maybe.

1021
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,270
The perk forces the first three slots.

1022
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:21,410
Yeah.

1023
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,640
You don't have items that triggers a lot.

1024
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,880
I think this one triggers...

1025
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,300
Well, so...

1026
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,380
Oh, it's only triggers from the first...

1027
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,300
peg popped.

1028
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,920
Nobody dies.

1029
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,580
Every three seconds.

1030
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,940
This one's every three seconds.

1031
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,740
It could be good.

1032
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,060
Love this game.

1033
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,740
Number goat op simulator.

1034
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,220
Wolf snake into four or five.

1035
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,500
Wait, why?

1036
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,210
Wait.

1037
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:24,990
My perk.

1038
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,410
Force triggers all non-upgraded.

1039
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,630
But now it's upgraded.

1040
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:31,030
Oops.

1041
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,870
Alright, Force Triggers all items.

1042
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,090
But does the order matter for those?

1043
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:38,470
What is this?

1044
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,970
Oh, neat!

1045
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:42,850
Whoa!

1046
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,020
Yeah, the cheese perk activates all, no?

1047
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,820
Besides this.

1048
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,160
Right?

1049
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,680
Yeah, my current perks don't care about slots.

1050
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,480
That's what I thought.

1051
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,700
I was like, am I going crazy?

1052
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,560
Only this one triggers to the right.

1053
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,220
I think we're okay.

1054
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,800
I think we can keep going.

1055
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,320
Well, I say that.

1056
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:13,740
I don't know.

1057
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,140
I don't know.

1058
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,480
This is my first time playing the game.

1059
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,200
Me acting like a stinking note all over here.

1060
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,160
Oh my gosh.

1061
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:21,700
Oh.

1062
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,000
Oh, geez.

1063
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:30,520
Oh.

1064
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,500
Oh.

1065
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,040
Psychic link.

1066
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,040
All psychic pegs will give points equal to their number when any psychic peg is popped.

1067
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,240
What does that mean?

1068
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:55,150
three more rounds and cheese house starts carrying true true because we got to make to 30.

1069
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:38,550
uh oh wait that was not a okay we're hanging on we're hanging on okay nice we got loot springy perk 5 chance for force trigger item and five force triggers a side slot can buy thank you so much for the pocketed force triggers the item in slot seven two times for each empty inventory slot neither of these kind of help neither of these void is absolutely busted when you build around it that's the thing right now though is i don't know any sort of build what

1070
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,620
could be good in five besides maybe the this one or...

1071
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,840
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1072
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,620
If we do five for this one every three seconds...

1073
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,360
Okay.

1074
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,480
It could force it to be...

1075
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,340
Only 5% chance, but, you know.

1076
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,640
I think it's better than nothing.

1077
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:05,280
Oh.

1078
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,440
That was terrible.

1079
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,580
That was terrible!

1080
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,280
There we go.

1081
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,340
We made it to round 30!

1082
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,900
Upgrade the lobster claw!

1083
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,900
Let's go.

1084
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,240
What is it?

1085
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,540
What will it do, though?

1086
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,900
Every enemy room.

1087
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,280
The claw.

1088
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,400
The claw.

1089
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,740
I don't have so much.

1090
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,080
So much.

1091
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,080
What's it called, though?

1092
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,100
Money.

1093
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:50,880
Doubles the value.

1094
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:51,820
Oh, okay.

1095
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:52,760
Nice.

1096
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,340
What's the value?

1097
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:02,440
value so what or would it be like four two what not quite sure what these numbers mean

1098
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:14,590
what this guy do the mouse the finger puppet nubby gives points equal to the number of times that nubby has bounced this round

1099
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:26,700
oh horse horse pill chance to double the highest number peg.

1100
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,020
Ultra rare, ultra rare.

1101
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,660
E block.

1102
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,080
Force trigger this item.

1103
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,360
When this is force triggered, it transfers the force trigger to the item to the left of me.

1104
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,980
Has a 15% chance to add an additional...

1105
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:46,620
Wait, add on one plus one additional force trigger.

1106
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,160
Wait!

1107
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,460
I could also upgrade.

1108
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,660
I think I should haunt though.

1109
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,840
I don't have enough money to upgrade.

1110
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,860
That sucks.

1111
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,260
Oh, well.

1112
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,920
I don't have enough money for anything.

1113
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,560
Well, shoot.

1114
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:14,780
Oh, well.

1115
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,200
We continue onwards.

1116
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,840
Onwards and upwards.

1117
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,080
Nice.

1118
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,640
Oh, okay.

1119
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,280
That was close.

1120
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,100
Me-ham!

1121
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:40,420
This peg will explode and pop eight pegs in a cross pattern when popped for the first time.

1122
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,120
Whoa!

1123
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,980
Holy score!

1124
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:51,940
Crazy!

1125
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,920
Oh my gosh.

1126
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,160
Oh my gosh.

1127
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,140
We're going crazy!

1128
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:07,800
Tonight!

1129
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,200
Tonight!

1130
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,380
Tonight!

1131
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,670
We are crazy!

1132
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:16,730
Oh!

1133
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,550
All seeing pyramid.

1134
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:24,690
This item emits a god ray.

1135
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,670
The god ray rapidly pops a random peg once for each time the item is in slot.

1136
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,910
Wait, the item in slot one has triggered this round.

1137
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,160
Wait, that sounds kind of awesome.

1138
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,840
though, but I can only get probably two things.

1139
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,590
I think we should get the horse.

1140
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:55,570
We'll get the horse.

1141
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,830
I have to upgrade my... I have to expand.

1142
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,950
What I could do

1143
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,390
is freeze him.

1144
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,630
Freeze the god ray.

1145
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:14,310
Get this, and expand, and then I'll get this next time.

1146
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:15,990
Cool.

1147
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,630
Wait, can I upgrade?

1148
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,090
I can't!

1149
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,050
Oh, why not?

1150
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,930
How many times can you upgrade?

1151
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,830
No, I can't.

1152
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,510
Well, that's sad.

1153
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,360
Can only upgrade once.

1154
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1155
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:48,820
If I had another upgraded cheese house, like, say, in another slot, Could I then combine them?

1156
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:55,470
Buy two slots.

1157
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,090
Oh, I guess I could, right?

1158
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:58,950
No.

1159
01:16:59,190 --> 01:16:59,790
Only once.

1160
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1161
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,150
What was this again?

1162
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,210
Oh!

1163
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,610
Might be good to get another one, though, right?

1164
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:09,010
I mean...

1165
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:16,150
Two cheese houses would be kind of great, because then we could get 7,500 plus another 3,000.

1166
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,250
Why not?

1167
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,070
And then I can unlock.

1168
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,120
And then I could sell them later.

1169
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:27,960
It's all good.

1170
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,420
Oh my gosh.

1171
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,940
Oh, that was not a...

1172
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,900
Oh, no way.

1173
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,840
No, I have like no gold.

1174
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:51,540
Why?

1175
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,580
What is the tree?

1176
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,580
Half's the highest number peg.

1177
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,920
Doubles the lowest number peg two times.

1178
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,720
What I'm going to do is I'm going to expand.

1179
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,020
Cafe.

1180
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,080
Cafe Nabi.

1181
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,120
Drag and drop food items into the mouth to eat.

1182
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,410
Kidney bean.

1183
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,830
Stocks a random rare food item.

1184
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,360
Mid cafe.

1185
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:32,560
Oh,

1186
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,520
that was bad.

1187
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,340
not good.

1188
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,580
This peg will break after it has been popped for the first time.

1189
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,780
Okay.

1190
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,260
Oh, like that.

1191
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,620
Cute doll!

1192
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,220
Horse triggers all first peg popped items.

1193
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:01,560
Which is that.

1194
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,460
If slot one is empty, a random...

1195
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,860
Oh, this is the... This is the gotcha perk.

1196
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:11,680
Hmm.

1197
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,350
Meantau.

1198
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:17,990
Sweetau.

1199
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:24,480
Minto, cuto, say it back.

1200
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:32,430
Yeah, my inventory will be full.

1201
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:33,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:39,910
Maybe we just go with zombie then.

1203
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,790
I'm just going to go with zombie.

1204
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,290
Or I could get the money.

1205
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,440
Hmm.

1206
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,160
I do need money.

1207
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,660
Actually, I think we have a few rounds, though, before the next shop.

1208
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,180
So I think it's okay.

1209
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,540
Meantos, zombo.

1210
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,840
I'll go with zombie.

1211
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,420
We're on the moon!

1212
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:15,980
Wow!

1213
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:17,620
Wee!

1214
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:19,660
Glad

1215
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:34,990
you have to go over there.

1216
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,130
Why couldn't you go here?

1217
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:37,710
Hmm.

1218
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:46,850
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1219
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,270
How many rounds are there?

1220
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:50,790
I still don't have enough?

1221
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:52,790
T-t.

1222
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,420
Force...

1223
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,060
T-block.

1224
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,440
100% chance to force trigger both on.

1225
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,880
items to the left and right of me.

1226
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,820
Odds decreased by 20% for each time this success late triggers.

1227
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Odds reset to 100% when the round is over.

1228
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:08,600
Nita!

1229
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,020
Kita!

1230
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,430
Sell Cheese House!

1231
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,330
But we're still using Cheese House.

1232
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,520
Check the cafe.

1233
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,600
Some food give you coins back.

1234
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,080
Oh, really?

1235
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,100
Let's see.

1236
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,060
Cute!

1237
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,340
Get one coin for every strawberry during this game maxes out at seven coins.

1238
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,500
Wait.

1239
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:37,820
So I...

1240
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:39,860
I...

1241
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,840
Wait, I eat the strawberry.

1242
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:43,140
Wait, what?

1243
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,240
What is this?

1244
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,180
A pickle rat.

1245
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,500
Upon returning to Nubimart, gain one Riro.

1246
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,700
It's an investment.

1247
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,960
Spend three, gain one.

1248
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:07,600
So I guess you start making the money back once you once you eat three strawberries.

1249
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,380
Is that the thing?

1250
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,980
You can sell the lowered ranked cheese.

1251
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,020
How do I sell it actually?

1252
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:17,940
Oh, right click.

1253
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,500
It's four gold.

1254
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,010
It's an investment in my future!

1255
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,700
Still wondering if I should get the strawberry.

1256
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,560
But a max is out at seven.

1257
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,680
When do I get the coin?

1258
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,700
Is it at the end of every round?

1259
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,160
Right now.

1260
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,060
Ah, oh, okay.

1261
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:12,010
Investment, investment, investing in my future!

1262
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:16,810
Holy cow!

1263
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,950
Holy points, you guys!

1264
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,710
Nine restocks!

1265
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,080
Say tease!

1266
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,160
This peg gives points twice when popped.

1267
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:51,210
Docs!

1268
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,650
I might be the best.

1269
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,490
Oh.

1270
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,190
Don't look at that one.

1271
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,090
That didn't count.

1272
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:03,660
Uh oh.

1273
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,200
Wait.

1274
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:04,820
Oh geez.

1275
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,980
I'm throwing.

1276
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:06,500
I'm throwing.

1277
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:07,060
I'm throwing.

1278
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:07,420
I'm throwing.

1279
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:08,980
I'm throwing.

1280
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,490
I made it!

1281
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:14,430
I lived!

1282
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:17,190
This again?

1283
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:22,710
I think Maybe we should do...

1284
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:29,710
Maybe we move this to...

1285
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,230
Slot 5 since it has the force trigger.

1286
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,270
We blame Nubby on those?

1287
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:49,570
Or wait, hold on.

1288
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:50,930
Or...

1289
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,510
I don't know.

1290
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,050
Will this go to 10%?

1291
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,290
It just says 2.

1292
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,530
So I can't tell.

1293
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,620
Random peg value could be low, that's true.

1294
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,960
Let's try it, let's see how this works.

1295
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,230
Whoa, no!

1296
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,610
Holy cow!

1297
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:34,450
Wait, it worked out so well!

1298
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:35,990
What the heck is this?

1299
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:37,190
Asbestos!

1300
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:41,190
Summons a clump of insulation that falls from the sky!

1301
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:44,810
When insulation touches a peg, it gives 5%, 10% of the round goal.

1302
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:46,970
Galatian does not pop pegs.

1303
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:48,090
Hmm.

1304
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,830
Squirmy!

1305
01:25:56,090 --> 01:26:00,070
Gives five points for every time the item has triggered during this round.

1306
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:00,570
One and five.

1307
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:03,350
Oh, the metamorphosize.

1308
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,710
You don't have many items that have pegs, though.

1309
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:16,670
For what?

1310
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,020
Oh, I just realized about the...

1311
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:24,920
Randomly pops a...

1312
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,320
Wait.

1313
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,160
Random... rapidly pops a random peg for each time the item in slot 1 is triggered.

1314
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,900
Well, it triggered pretty... a lot, actually.

1315
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,280
I think the spring helped.

1316
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,120
Oh, when three pegs halved!

1317
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,020
Oh, I keep forgetting to look at how...

1318
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:47,960
It's triggered.

1319
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,320
Ouch.

1320
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,140
Oh, sorry.

1321
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,160
I just have run out of you.

1322
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,920
I missed Oji Day because of work, but thanks.

1323
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,440
Thanks for being the best copy of Shigapassi.

1324
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,740
Ask where I lurk in a lot of streams and watch mods at work.

1325
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,060
I'm so proud to call me by Oji.

1326
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:01,500
Eric!

1327
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:01,680
That's...

1328
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,180
That's all I could ever ask.

1329
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:03,780
Thank you.

1330
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,120
Thank you so much.

1331
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,420
Thank you.

1332
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,180
Thank you.

1333
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,840
Oh, you can click on the Ion.

1334
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:09,280
That's right.

1335
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:11,380
Whoa.

1336
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,720
I don't know what times 13 means, but it seems huge.

1337
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:22,340
I think we might want to get the T block and, like, put it in between these two or something.

1338
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,540
Or, like, maybe Jake even.

1339
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,540
Oh, wait.

1340
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,720
Jake can't be forced.

1341
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,320
That's right.

1342
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,320
Never mind.

1343
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,180
Or maybe horse.

1344
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,020
Put it in between these two.

1345
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,880
T-block and five?

1346
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,640
That's what I'm thinking.

1347
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,400
Let's try it.

1348
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:01,440
Is this how many times...

1349
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,500
This is how...

1350
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,080
It can't be how many times they're activated.

1351
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:05,900
I don't know.

1352
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,460
Squirmion one.

1353
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,100
Trust.

1354
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,400
Reroll.

1355
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:15,860
This one's...

1356
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,740
good

1357
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:48,880
eight pegs popped oh yeah the cafe whoa i take this chip and i eat it if you have less than maximum lives restore one live otherwise re-rolls cafe foods hi dog dog in one coin for each remaining life way to have five lives that'd be pretty good i would get two back two free

1358
01:28:52,360 --> 01:29:17,260
roll for strobe though gives one kebab perk nobody dies 50 chance to force trigger the right most item in your inventory what did i play that oh volatro this is just like volatro where like the order of everything matters yeah

1359
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:28,080
we'll probably eat something i'm just trying to decide what

1360
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,190
free money

1361
01:29:49,130 --> 01:30:12,370
wait I well it's 11 coins I'm not gonna 11 coins for for a re-roll I think I might kebab what if we move these three you know this could be the this could be I don't know why I'm like thinking the god ray you know I don't know

1362
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,800
stack kebab

1363
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,640
Where do the kebab perks go?

1364
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,860
How am I even supposed to see where they're at?

1365
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,240
We're at round 50, guys.

1366
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,200
We're killing it.

1367
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,010
The books.

1368
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,050
Oh, I see it.

1369
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:47,610
I see it.

1370
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:52,880
T-box at 5?

1371
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,480
Oh, that's right.

1372
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,360
Yes, yes, yes.

1373
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,080
That's right.

1374
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:56,620
That's right.

1375
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,460
Wait, but then what do we put in 7?

1376
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,240
I guess that's fine there too.

1377
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,400
Whoa, what is this?

1378
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,580
Oh, I have the eyeball on, that's why.

1379
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,110
Super score!

1380
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:30,890
Uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh.

1381
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:34,010
Oh, we made it, we made it, we made it, we made it, team.

1382
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:36,590
That was pretty scary.

1383
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,550
Booger party!

1384
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:53,610
Wind pop this peg will emit two snout shots That pop any pegs they pass through Okay Oh geez Uh oh wait this is bad This might be bad news bears

1385
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:01,170
Oh my gosh Whoa whoa whoa Oh no no no

1386
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:26,540
Oh we made it We made it Oh that was close I was scared I was scared guys Uh-oh, oh,

1387
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,760
where's our big guy?

1388
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,760
All the way down there?

1389
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,920
Okay, uh...

1390
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,380
52 rounds.

1391
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,320
Board clears.

1392
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,700
Wow, okay.

1393
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,140
Overachievers over here.

1394
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,260
This is just Bilatro Bapaliko.

1395
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:14,480
Yes.

1396
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,520
I want a board clear.

1397
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:19,560
Okay.

1398
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,280
I want a board clear, but I also just want to play the game.

1399
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,110
It was a pixel perfect shot.

1400
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:41,530
One point.

1401
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:46,470
Oh, dang it.

1402
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:51,670
I thought it would, like, bounce over to in here.

1403
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:54,650
What do we got?

1404
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:56,250
What do we got at the mart?

1405
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:57,270
Nabi mart.

1406
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:58,070
Nabi marty.

1407
01:33:58,170 --> 01:33:59,590
Yeah, Nubimart.

1408
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:07,650
Oh, flaming skull.

1409
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,530
I needed you.

1410
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,290
I needed you.

1411
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:21,680
When a peg is smacked, it cannot just peg half.

1412
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,080
Get the skull?

1413
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:25,700
Yeah.

1414
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,680
Bread to the bones.

1415
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,460
Let's try it.

1416
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,460
Doesn't hurt to try something, right?

1417
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,200
Unless you freaking die.

1418
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:34,980
Wait, what?

1419
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,400
How does it say?

1420
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,320
Oh, Nubby dies.

1421
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:36,680
That's right.

1422
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,200
I was like, how does this trigger again?

1423
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,090
Okay, Skull, I need you to do your job.

1424
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,510
I need you to do your job.

1425
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:55,900
Please.

1426
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:56,680
No!

1427
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:05,830
I got some loot.

1428
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:07,550
It's shaking its head.

1429
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:07,950
Whoa!

1430
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,150
The Warlock perk.

1431
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,770
Force triggers all Nubby dies items again.

1432
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,810
Well...

1433
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,490
Force triggers all items.

1434
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,170
I think cheese

1435
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:38,040
Cheese, my beloved Oh,

1436
01:35:41,620 --> 01:36:03,780
we haven't seen Whoa, whoa Guys, these are all rare Whoa, whoa Whoa, I maybe got the luckiest Store ever Oh my god Oh my god How How, how, how Wait, oh my gosh.

1437
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,340
Okay, we gotta sell the skull.

1438
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,920
We gotta sell the skull.

1439
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,980
Okay, what I think I'll do is I'll freeze one nose and get the other nose.

1440
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:13,580
But what's this?

1441
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:19,380
Laser pointer triggers an electron beam that passes through pegs when the electron beam hits a peg.

1442
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,200
The peg will give 50% of its number.

1443
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,680
Electron beams do not pop pegs.

1444
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,880
Wait, the laser sounds so good too, though.

1445
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,520
Inflatable dolphin summons a beach ball that emits five streams of confetti when it pops.

1446
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:36,240
by confetti give 125% right these all sound so good

1447
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:49,420
Miranda peg will emit three snout shots that pop any pegs they pass through cheesy minto recipe google please freaking cute

1448
01:36:54,260 --> 01:37:04,900
the reason I want to get the nose is because we have two we can just basically upgrade almost immediately We have to pass the round goal, though.

1449
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:07,460
Two pegs halved.

1450
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,440
I don't have anything that halves.

1451
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:13,440
Unless I have no items that will halve it.

1452
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,760
Laser is good once you get the seal.

1453
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,400
Okay, I'll get the laser.

1454
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,660
For as an investment.

1455
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,240
Is there anything you guys think I should...

1456
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:28,560
Freeze.

1457
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,120
Nubby dies.

1458
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,910
This could be like a save...

1459
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,350
Like it saves the round kind of thing, you know?

1460
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,350
Freeze the nose?

1461
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,410
Okay, we'll freeze the nose.

1462
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:47,410
Dang, what a crazy pull!

1463
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:49,730
Holy moly.

1464
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,570
Oh, oh, there we go.

1465
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,190
Oh!

1466
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:00,530
I still shot it.

1467
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:02,730
Oh, that was terrible.

1468
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:03,610
No!

1469
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:07,650
Adrigo!

1470
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:09,070
Thank you so much, brother!

1471
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:12,630
Tawani gifted, gosh, I don't recognize you at all!

1472
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:15,050
With your new profile picture.

1473
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:19,550
Month one of asking Vito to marry me.

1474
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:22,850
But you've been a member for five months!

1475
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,450
Another game I need to buy, thanks for the great shoes Vito!

1476
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:26,110
Of course!

1477
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:29,710
Thank you so much for the super chat!

1478
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,320
Wanderic Zero, welcome back!

1479
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:46,960
Oh, no, no, no!

1480
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,100
That was bad.

1481
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,040
Wait, did I just...

1482
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,700
Oh my gosh, I just did the same exact thing.

1483
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,300
No, please.

1484
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,020
Guys, I'm throwing!

1485
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:58,540
I'm throwing!

1486
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,320
I'm throwing!

1487
01:38:59,480 --> 01:38:59,480
I'm throwing!

1488
01:38:59,600 --> 01:38:59,780
I'm throwing!

1489
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:00,140
I'm throwing!

1490
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:00,660
I'm throwing!

1491
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,440
Oh my god.

1492
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,340
Please, please, please.

1493
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:04,220
I need a hero!

1494
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:05,700
Oh!

1495
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,780
I'm on it!

1496
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:14,560
I'm for a hero!

1497
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:16,260
No!

1498
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:17,980
No!

1499
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,960
I'm sorry guys!

1500
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,900
I threw, I threw!

1501
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,920
That was terrible!

1502
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,200
You know how in Peggle you can be extremely precise?

1503
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,540
With like...

1504
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:37,700
Moving the mouse very slightly will change.

1505
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,080
I thought it would be more like that, you know?

1506
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:42,920
Uh, hello?

1507
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:45,840
Okay.

1508
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:46,860
I get it.

1509
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,400
I understand.

1510
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,520
You don't throw, you bounce.

1511
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,440
Marriage proposal number 18.

1512
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,880
I deleted your memory before.

1513
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,220
How?

1514
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:05,720
Time, bones.

1515
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,400
Welcome to membership, thank you.

1516
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,460
Is cactus good?

1517
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,820
I kind of want to try it.

1518
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,100
Fragetti beam.

1519
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,900
Why can't I ever get the spaghetti beam?

1520
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,800
Mouse wheel might find...

1521
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,700
Oh, well, I'll try it.

1522
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,360
I'll try it.

1523
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:24,960
Ouch.

1524
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,580
I think I got a bug bite.

1525
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,760
It's good, but it's really good when it's upgraded.

1526
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,900
Okay, let's aim for upgrade then.

1527
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,800
Oh, we got all our lives back.

1528
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,320
Let's go.

1529
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:03,420
Itty.

1530
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,920
Itty-o-shey.

1531
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,160
No.

1532
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:08,000
No.

1533
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,680
Thank you

1534
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:16,970
so much for that, Tawani!

1535
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:21,950
Went to marry Minto for 1,000 years, spaghetti dinners.

1536
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,030
Oh, spaghetti dinners!

1537
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,090
Okay, wait a second.

1538
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:29,990
Force triggers all non-upgraded items.

1539
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,430
The chaotic perk.

1540
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:34,110
Force triggers one random item every second.

1541
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:36,070
Wait, that could be good if it's a second?

1542
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:37,750
Every second?

1543
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,870
But this is every one and a half seconds.

1544
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:43,130
Hmm.

1545
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:47,510
I always want to cause a chaos.

1546
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:48,750
Oh.

1547
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:50,270
Oh, I forgot.

1548
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:52,790
Oh, see, look how much it's going now.

1549
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:55,830
Seal, where were you?

1550
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:59,410
Where were you?

1551
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:03,290
Where were you when I needed you?

1552
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:06,390
Bedrope, bedrope, bedrope, bedrope, burn.

1553
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,190
Come out!

1554
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:10,890
Thank you for the tiny gift.

1555
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:11,550
Thank you.

1556
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:19,330
Later on, you have almost all slash most upgraded items.

1557
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,530
Right, right, right.

1558
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:24,150
First ever Super Chat, and it's on my birthday!

1559
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,290
Look at that, my kamiyoshi streaming today.

1560
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:27,830
Shiny hunting a ghastly!

1561
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:29,570
Good luck!

1562
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:31,770
Happy birthday!

1563
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:32,050
Wait.

1564
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,030
Huh.

1565
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:36,830
Feliz Complianios!

1566
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,890
Did I say it right?

1567
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:41,530
Did I say it right?

1568
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,540
I did?

1569
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,440
I remembered!

1570
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:57,280
Yippee!

1571
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,510
It was perfect!

1572
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:08,650
Happy.

1573
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:12,830
I'm gonna get sealed and I'm gonna pray.

1574
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:14,670
We get the laser beam again.

1575
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,690
That's the build we're going for.

1576
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:19,610
That's the build.

1577
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:21,710
Oh, oh.

1578
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:21,830
Oh.

1579
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,880
Oh,

1580
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:34,920
land...

1581
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:35,600
Oh, jeez.

1582
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:43,440
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1583
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,040
Oh, I shouldn't have...

1584
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,220
I shouldn't have re-ruled.

1585
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,480
I thought I might get something better.

1586
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:52,280
Please!

1587
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:53,640
Ah.

1588
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:01,460
Are you gonna stream on the 29th of this month, or do you still not know?

1589
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,660
That is a great question.

1590
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:08,260
Does it happen to be your birthday on the 29th?

1591
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,380
I can check my schedule.

1592
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:13,600
I can check my calendar literally right now, and I can tell you.

1593
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,920
Oh, wait, there's actually a possibility.

1594
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,200
There's actually a possibility of me being able to stream that day.

1595
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,740
But, well, it might be...

1596
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,900
It might be the 28th your time, though.

1597
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:51,440
Time zone.

1598
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:52,640

1599
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:16,880

1603
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:04,430
The new wisp uniform.

1604
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,850
Oh my gosh, I hope there's an army next con.

Wait.

1610
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:20,730
Just because I haven't tried it yet, I want to get a mystery.

1611
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:20,910
Oh.

1612
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:22,150
I don't get it.

1613
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:23,290
that mystery.

1614
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:27,730
When opened, 85% chance to receive a random common item.

1615
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:31,070
8% chance to receive a random common perk.

1616
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:34,670
5% chance to receive a random rare item.

1617
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:38,250
2% chance to receive a random rare perk.

1618
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:41,270
Rare perk and hoi!

1619
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:42,910
Oh.

1620
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:45,570
Got a water bear.

1621
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:49,430
Wait, what does this guy do?

1622
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:51,190
Oh, the peg is halved.

1623
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:55,650
Let's go gambling.

1624
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:55,990
Hoi!

1625
01:47:57,190 --> 01:47:58,270
No, no, no, no!

1626
01:47:58,690 --> 01:47:59,710
YouTube, I didn't say that!

1627
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,890
YouTube, I said nothing.

1628
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:01,950
YouTube, I said nothing.

1629
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,010
YouTube, I didn't say that.

1630
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:06,270
I didn't say that at all.

1631
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:07,350
This is not gambling.

1632
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:08,530
There's no gambling involved.

1633
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:12,390
You guys are literally gonna get me cancelled.

1634
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:26,930
I knew I should have re-done this one.

1635
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,610
Oh my gosh!

1636
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:32,130
There we go.

1637
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:34,810
Ripvod!

1638
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:40,150
It actually gave me a warning though, which means if I got...

1639
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:43,950
If I had gotten anything more?

1640
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:46,530
Like, or rather... Oh, we can upgrade the cactus!

1641
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:50,130
Like say I got... say...

1642
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:53,410
Um...

1643
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:59,430
Say I got another warning, it would actually turn into a strike and like actually affect my channel.

1644
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:00,530
Like, it's so freaky.

1645
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,050
The warning was dismissed, luckily.

1646
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:06,790
Once they, once they determined that my...

1647
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:07,330
Oh gosh.

1648
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:08,470
Oh no, no!

1649
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:13,090
Once they determined that my VOD was okay, but like...

1650
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:16,890
So close!

1651
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:25,890
If they hadn't determined that it was okay, like, if I had gotten any more warnings, it would have turned into a strike.

1652
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:35,590
And people were telling me they were like, oh, it's the new...

1653
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:50,690
It's the new YouTube policy, but apparently said policy says that it won't be enacted until later this month.

1654
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:53,810
So there was no reason for them to actually have gone after me.

1655
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:56,670
So I don't know if maybe...

1656
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:59,690
I'm hoping that like they're not like, oh yeah, it was fun.

1657
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:01,350
For now.

1658
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:09,920
I saw the calendar and you have only like four days off.

1659
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh, it's okay.

1660
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,940
So, whoa!

1661
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,740
Dance and Dino!

1662
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,580
60% chance to do nothing.

1663
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,520
20% chance to double one random peg.

1664
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:31,400
20% chance to half one random peg.

1665
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,840
If Nubby bounces, that's crazy.

1666
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,180
Oh, we could get some pants.

1667
01:50:47,090 --> 01:51:13,050
but yeah so i don't know i hope that they don't like say that it was fine and then once they put in that rule even though the rule the rule is insane they're like no gambling no gambling and also i'm even afraid to say the word oh my gosh and they're like oh they say that you can't do that And it's also,

1668
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:14,430
like, even if it's not real money.

1669
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:19,290
So I'm like, I can't play, like, you can't play, like, blackjack anymore.

1670
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:21,050
You can't do anything anymore.

1671
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:23,970
Stop saying the G word.

1672
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:29,010
What happens with people that play, like, gotcha games?

1673
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:31,730
Yeah, it's so crazy.

1674
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:35,950
It's, like, actually crazy.

1675
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:42,150
Obviously, I understand, like, why...

1676
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:42,990
They would want...

1677
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:45,810
Because some stuff, like, kind of goes insane.

1678
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,820
But...

1679
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:50,790
I don't know.

1680
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:52,210
Let's go juggling.

1681
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:52,610
Oi!

1682
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:56,190
I'm nervous.

1683
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:59,310
I don't think Bellatra would be affected.

1684
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:07,700
Loop boxes equals...

1685
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:09,780
Equals...

1686
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,120
Juggling?

1687
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:14,040
So nobody could stream Fortnite anymore?

1688
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,620
Wait, does Fortnite does have loot boxes, right?

1689
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:17,700
Why am I crazy?

1690
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:28,000
Do you like carbonara or other pasta dishes?

1691
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,280
What's your favorite Italian food?

1692
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,120
I love pasta.

1693
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,420
I think the Google App Store tried to restrict Bellatro.

1694
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,560
No stinking way!

1695
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,260
No way.

1696
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,060
I'm gonna get the dinosaur because he's cute.

1697
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,420
We're gonna go dino.

1698
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,680
Everybody do the dinosaur.

1699
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,220
It was simi- is it gambling?

1700
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,440
Bilatro!

1701
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,100
Am I crazy?

1702
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,620
Do I not know what gambling is?

1703
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:09,900
I mean juggling?

1704
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:22,390
Uh oh.

1705
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:23,670
Uh oh.

1706
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:34,090
It's basically poker so it's juggling.

1707
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:37,310
Oh, I

1708
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,370
see.

1709
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:48,710
Oh, what's that?

1710
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:50,590
The sneaky perk.

1711
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:52,970
Item in slot 2 triggers.

1712
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:54,950
Force triggers all items.

1713
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:56,710
Disables the item in slot 2.

1714
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:00,010
Or the ray gun.

1715
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:03,570
40% chance to force trigger the item in slot 3.

1716
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,320
Money juggling is also juggling.

1717
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:40,580
these have money belatra doesn't have money clover pit doesn't have money but snake perk is made for jake the snake let's get jake the snake with it yeah if i live to see the day i want to live i want to live oh no i might not live i might not live to see the day oh i live to see the day

1718
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:53,340
Jax and Cactus seem quite similar.

1719
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:56,480
Actually, I'll do Cactus because it's just five pegs popped.

1720
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,340
Why am I doing so poorly?

1721
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:01,760
Probably because I'm a little distracted.

1722
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:02,340
Sorry, guys.

1723
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:03,840
Oh.

1724
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:04,920
Okay.

1725
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,020
New game, that was terrible.

1726
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,500
Thanks a lot, Nubby.

1727
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,680
Thanks for nothing.

1728
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,140
Wow, that was so bad.

1729
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,760
He heard my...

1730
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,340
Cries of anguish.

1731
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,000
These are terrible, Nubi.

1732
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:26,880
Come on!

1733
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:27,820
Come on!

1734
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,660
We got a quota to meet!

1735
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,540
We'll go back with the cactus.

1736
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,990
We need the numbers.

1737
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:48,430
We need big numbers.

1738
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:50,650
How do we get big numbers?

1739
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:53,130
By scoring big prizes.

1740
01:55:55,390 --> 01:56:11,550
oh dang it i keep forgetting to try and okay so the scroll wheel does not um does not pinpoint your your shot in case anybody was curious

1741
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:26,270
you're too peggle brain i think so 10 pegs pro popped the drainer force triggers the left most item in your inventory.

1742
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,370
Lose 3% of your total points.

1743
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:36,190
Drain gang.

1744
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:39,710
Yeah, the game's not really about precision.

1745
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:40,170
No.

1746
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:42,330
Doesn't seem to be that way.

1747
01:56:43,450 --> 01:56:46,370
I just noticed that this game has seeds too.

1748
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,050
That's crazy.

1749
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:52,730
I guess all kind of rogue like games like this have seeds.

1750
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,940
This game is really fun.

1751
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:00,100
Happy to see you playing it.

1752
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:01,240
It's so fun!

1753
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,800
Drainer perk was buffed.

1754
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,860
Was it not before?

1755
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:09,820
I guess force triggers the leftmost item in your inventory is pretty good.

1756
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:16,260
But the chaotic perk with... I only have...

1757
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:27,900
Technically speaking, anything with random anythings has a seed.

1758
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,500
Yeah, but I've noticed it more where they'll...

1759
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,100
where games are like showing it.

1760
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:35,300
They'll be like, oh, here's the seed number.

1761
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,900
Just kind of, like, out in the open.

1762
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,900
It used to be 15%?

1763
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:43,540
Wow.

1764
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,740
I'm going to go chaotic.

1765
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,330
We're playing it safe.

1766
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:54,350
We got our health back.

1767
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:54,990
Let's go.

1768
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:55,850
Let's go.

1769
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:57,210
I'm going to re-roll.

1770
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:58,450
Wait.

1771
01:57:59,170 --> 01:57:59,850
No, sorry.

1772
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:02,430
I was thinking of Jake the snake.

1773
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:05,930
me your seed.

1774
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:11,650
I mean, I can move if you want it, but because it's right behind me, you can kind of see the numbers.

1775
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,930
The numbers, the numbers!

1776
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:30,190
Squirmy!

1777
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:38,140
I could try the crazy straw again.

1778
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:43,340
I jumble with pegs a lot, so I think I'll try crazy straw again.

1779
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:52,710
nice that

1780
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:11,150
was my hannah montana you know like when they're transitioning from one scene to another then they're like oh yeah

1781
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:33,850
See in transition?

1782
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:37,170
I can't get the key.

1783
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:39,630
I could... Wait, how much gold do I get those?

1784
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:43,690
And then if I get this again, do I get...

1785
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:46,530
1 to 10 coins.

1786
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:48,950
No!

1787
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:55,180
For someone like me, though, that's just a normal straw.

1788
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:57,760
Is it because...

1789
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,600
Oh, I would have to play again!

1790
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,900
Oh, I'm an idiot.

1791
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:01,740
Whatever.

1792
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:32,620
one single coin oof oof go for the key I should have that was my bad not locked in hard enough you guys oh did I make it was that Is this a new round?

1793
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:35,580
We made it?

1794
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,320
Whoa!

1795
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,280
Two-headed toy doll.

1796
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,320
10 pegs pop.

1797
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:45,620
The lowest number peg gives points equal to 10 times its number.

1798
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:50,620
If the lowest peg is 64 or less, it will give 1000 plus points instead.

1799
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,620
Oh, we could upgrade the cactus.

1800
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,320
Let's do that.

1801
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:57,600
Do do do.

1802
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,100
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1803
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,460
Wait, what's a big...

1804
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:09,340
What's a big carry?

1805
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:09,960
This guy?

1806
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,700
I imagine, so...

1807
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,380
I'm gonna freeze him.

1808
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:16,680
Freeze!

1809
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:19,740
Freeze!

1810
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:25,900
Holy!

1811
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,560
What was this saying again?

1812
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:31,620
The peg disables a random item when fully popped.

1813
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,160
Oh, that's right.

1814
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:33,900
Scary.

1815
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:38,440
Oh, geez.

1816
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:39,240
Oh, geez.

1817
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:39,740
Oh, geez.

1818
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:40,300
Oh, geez.

1819
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:42,000
Oh, hi.

1820
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,200
You're gonna poop in your papa!

1821
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:44,380
Oh, no.

1822
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,500
No, no, no!

1823
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,240
Uh-oh.

1824
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:47,780
Uh-oh.

1825
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,100
Why did you bounce like that?

1826
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:49,500
Ugh.

1827
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:00,970
Why?

1828
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:02,110
Why, indeed.

1829
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:12,210
Oh, team.

1830
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:15,170
It's pretty tough out here for us.

1831
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:19,030
It's pretty tough out here for us.

1832
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:21,410
I bounced on it too crazy.

1833
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:24,590
You know it.

1834
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:28,210
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1835
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,030
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1836
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,200
Bounce on it, die yo.

1837
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:52,100
I want to try the asbestos.

1838
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,280
I want to try it.

1839
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,100
Oh.

1840
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:04,100
Bounce.

1841
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:04,980
Bounce.

1842
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:07,480
We still made it somehow.

1843
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,540
A-bestos!

1844
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:15,260
Wait, I don't see the asbestos happening at all, though.

1845
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,360
Where is it?

1846
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:18,660
Where's all the asbestos?

1847
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,220
Isn't it supposed to be raining?

1848
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:24,460
Someone's a clump of insulation that falls from the sky.

1849
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,340
Where is it touching?

1850
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,040
Oh, the trigger.

1851
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:29,600
Oh.

1852
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:31,440
I

1853
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:41,780
didn't even have it.

1854
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,000
Gamers can't read.

1855
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:44,520
Oh, lunar perk.

1856
02:03:45,920 --> 02:04:12,820
triggers the item in slots six one time for every seven rounds you've passed speedy perk oh my gosh i once did at like a i guess you would call it a somewhat fancy hotel in japan it was like an art gallery hotel and i quite liked it a little i liked it a little bit i quite liked it not so much

1857
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:21,740
It was like they would have like a bunch of different art installations and stuff.

1858
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:27,080
And one of the paintings literally looked like this.

1859
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,140
It looked like a little stick man running.

1860
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,020
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

1861
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:36,940
I definitely took a picture because I was like, this is ass.

1862
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:41,940
It was like $1,000 for a stick man running.

1863
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,800
It was crazy!

1864
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,200
I was like, this is actually crazy.

1865
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:56,900
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1866
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,440
This is the time I went.

1867
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,840
It was definitely this year, so...

1868
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,120
I have the images somewhere.

1869
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:10,500
Hold on.

1870
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,500
Brief intermission.

1871
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:14,960
While I search for this...

1872
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,420
This stupid painting.

1873
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:18,720
It looked like...

1874
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,820
Even worse, it looked like it was done in paint.

1875
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:21,840
Like it was...

1876
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,100
I can't get over how bad it was.

1877
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,000
It was so silly.

1878
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:34,960
Nya nya nya.

1879
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:37,900
Makes it better.

1880
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,060
I know.

1881
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:40,440
It was like...

1882
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,220
Don't get me wrong.

1883
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,000
It was funny.

1884
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,880
But for the price...

1885
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,620
I was like, no, don't do this.

1886
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,840
Not for that price.

1887
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,380
Um, oh, maybe...

1888
02:05:57,380 --> 02:05:59,080
No, it wasn't this trip.

1889
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,200
Eee!

1890
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:03,900
Eee!

1891
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:05,460
Eee!

1892
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,280
I don't take that many photos.

1893
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,000
I know I took a picture of it, though.

1894
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,260
I know I did.

1895
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,660
Where are you?

1896
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,680
Where are you?

1897
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,140
Wait.

1898
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,060
I may be in here.

1899
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,520
I think I give up.

1900
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,760
I give up so fast.

1901
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:35,980
And I'm so sorry.

1902
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,300
I really can't find it.

1903
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:41,880
If I find it, I'll post it on Twitter.

1904
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,540
It's going to bother me, though.

1905
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,160
You know?

1906
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:47,380
When you're like, are looking for something?

1907
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,900
Or you're trying to think of something?

1908
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:50,860
And it's like, it's stuck in your brain.

1909
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,900
And you're like, I can't move on.

1910
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,040
Will I find it?

1911
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,080
That's how I feel right now.

1912
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,340
Even though I'm like...

1913
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,480
I'm causing a holdup.

1914
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:06,340
A holdup of my...

1915
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:09,320
stream.

1916
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:11,740
Wee!

1917
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:13,920
Wee!

1918
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:17,680
Look up, Ringo's stars are.

1919
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:19,660
All of it is in MSP and it's terrible.

1920
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,200
I don't want to see.

1921
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,240
We don't want to see it.

1922
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:26,520
Went to a fancy art gallery with my husband years ago.

1923
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:30,540
We saw a floor-to-ceiling canvas with the charcoal outline of the Superman S.

1924
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,760
It was like 3K.

1925
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,480
No way.

1926
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:36,140
Ringo Star Artwork.

1927
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,880
Oh, wow.

1928
02:07:45,170 --> 02:07:50,470
Every single one is like a zoomed-in picture of somebody's face.

1929
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:53,770
The man can't.

1930
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:55,870
The man can't.

1931
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:05,670
If you give me a chance, ma'am, I'll hold it up.

1932
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:08,050
What are you holding up?

1933
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:19,830
Maybe.

1934
02:08:20,070 --> 02:08:20,350
Hold on.

1935
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:21,770
I'm going to give it one last shot.

1936
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:23,770
I'm going to look a little bit slower.

1937
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:26,250
A little slower.

1938
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:29,050
Just a wink slower.

1939
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:33,990
I have some funny pictures in here.

1940
02:08:37,290 --> 02:08:41,070
Oh yeah, no, I don't think.

1941
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:44,270
Unless?

1942
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:49,590
Oh, maybe I deleted it.

1943
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:50,870
What am I an idiot?

1944
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:51,690
Why did I...

1945
02:08:51,690 --> 02:08:52,530
Wait, wait.

1946
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,110
Was it earlier this year?

1947
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:56,050
I could have sworn it was, like, later this year.

1948
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:02,030
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.

1949
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:08,390
Totally worth it.

1950
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:10,350
I'm going to show you guys and you're going to be like...

1951
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:16,670
You're gonna be like, okay, cool story.

1952
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,390
I'm gonna be like, isn't this picture crazy?

1953
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:30,570
And you're gonna be like, you're gonna be like, this is not worth the 20 minute.

1954
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,870
Wait!

1955
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:34,510
Oh, I think I just found the hotel.

1956
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:35,390
Okay, we're close.

1957
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:38,350
Oh my gosh, it was earlier this year.

1958
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:52,520
It's worse than I remember

1959
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:05,280
Wait, it's so much worse than I remember Does it have the price on it?

02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,670
Or we could get the uranium.

1976
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:01,830
Rod!

1977
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:07,830
Thank you for sharing that with us, Minky.

1978
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:12,530
Was it worth like the five minute, ten minute intermission?

1979
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:20,300
That only triggers if you die fast.

1980
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,520
Oh, did I read wrong?

1981
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:23,320
Oopsie!

1982
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:32,770
Oh, wait, okay.

1983
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:44,300
I'm playing the game now, I'm playing the game.

1984
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:51,600
the game gold rush what

1985
02:12:55,270 --> 02:13:21,710
a terrible setup it was worth it i'm glad it was better than i hoped i remember it being really bad but like i said i didn't remember it being it was it was definitely worse than i remembered oh the gravatron If I get the gold, can I get the key?

1986
02:13:22,590 --> 02:13:26,610
Always be the reason someone thinks what is wrong with rich people.

1987
02:13:28,990 --> 02:13:36,110
I'm so rich, I get MS paint drawings on my wall.

1988
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:37,790
Ten!

1989
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:38,790
Three.

1990
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:42,010
No!

1991
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,610
Okay, ten!

1992
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:46,350
Ten!

1993
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:48,430
Seven!

1994
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,810
Key.

1995
02:13:57,710 --> 02:14:00,990
Mysterious key, it's so suspicious and weird.

1996
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:06,430
It may make all your dreams come true.

1997
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:09,170
This is the suspicious key.

1998
02:14:09,650 --> 02:14:12,530
You are so freaky and fun.

1999
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:17,410
I can't wait to go to the black market with you.

2000
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:21,130
I think I'm gonna die.

2001
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:22,910
I don't think we're gonna make it.

2002
02:14:23,450 --> 02:14:24,210
It's over, Minky.

2003
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:24,950
Ah!

2004
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:37,150
Can I have your blessing to cosplay you and do parkour and break dancing?

2005
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:37,770
Yes!

2006
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:39,230
Be safe, though.

2007
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:43,350
Hearing 10 minutes of Minto laughing will always be worth it.

2008
02:14:48,990 --> 02:15:17,290
though that asbestos never triggered not even what all the sweaty nubby players are like they're gripping their thighs like this stupid bee tuber wait 3d glasses ultra rare first peg popped a random peg emits a pulse that doubles pegs But then close range!

2009
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:18,510
Woo!

2010
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,770
But I have to freeze you.

2011
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:22,570
I must freeze you.

2012
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:24,470
Nose!

2013
02:15:26,830 --> 02:15:27,450
Ultra bear!

2014
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:28,230
Ultra bear!

2015
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:33,600
A random peg...

2016
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:35,060
I can't get this one either though.

2017
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:35,600
Sucks.

2018
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:37,820
I want the nose.

2019
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:41,200
Nobody hits the wall twice.

2020
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:45,740
Doubles four random pegs whose number is less than 32.

2021
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:50,660
Peg fully popped, pops the lowest number peg twice.

2022
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:55,720
If I reroll, this still freezes, though, right?

2023
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:03,040
Nah, you can only freeze one item.

2024
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:05,400
I'm scared.

2025
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:06,260
Oh, okay.

2026
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:10,920
Happy seal.

2027
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:11,860
Happy, happy, happy.

2028
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,540
This might be...

2029
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:32,720
Gives points equal to the number of times that Nubby has bounced this round.

2030
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:35,420
How many times have it bounced?

2031
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,460
Like, what's a hot... like...

2032
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:40,420
What, I get like a hundred or something maybe?

2033
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,560
Finger puppet can help you survive.

2034
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:43,420
That's true.

2035
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,300
Good early but bad later.

2036
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:49,260
That's what I was thinking.

2037
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:51,540
We can grab it for now and...

2038
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:57,850
Just kind of Have it

2039
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:13,600
Sneaky snipers Okay

2040
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:48,250
Hmm, okay, that's not bad It's actually quite good Whoa, big, big Crazy Oh yeah, the eyeball The trainer I'm gonna get the spring For late game We are investing in our future Investing in the future

2041
02:17:53,790 --> 02:18:10,690
Hoppe Thank you, welcome back We got another rare Wait, I could get both If Nubby is still alive Someone an egg missile that falls from the sky continues an explosion that pops a row of pegs every half second wait that's crazy no

2042
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:21,930
seems good it does seem good

2043
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:28,790
it seems uh it seems not so bad

2044
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:42,360
ah Gold Rush!

2045
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:47,420
Come on.

2046
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:48,780
Yeah, keep going.

2047
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:49,580
Yeah!

2048
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:12,980
So maybe, it probably would be good to not go for the high one, because then I could double it.

2049
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:15,580
These eggs be crazy.

2050
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:18,040
I'm going to try and get this guy again.

2051
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,260
The key.

2052
02:19:25,670 --> 02:19:25,730
Rare.

2053
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:31,830
Force triggered this item.

2054
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:32,890
When this is force triggered.

2055
02:19:35,710 --> 02:19:36,850
I think we...

2056
02:19:36,850 --> 02:19:38,590
Maybe it would be good in five.

2057
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:42,490
I can get it.

2058
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:42,890
Nice.

2059
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:46,350
E.

2060
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:46,730
E.

2061
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:47,310
E.

2062
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:47,970
E.

2063
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,190
E.

2064
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:51,370
glasses goes crazy.

2065
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:00,880
Oh, that's right.

2066
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:02,280
I meant to not.

2067
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:03,940
That's okay, though.

2068
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:08,020
Oh, oh.

2069
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:09,660
It, like, doesn't owe it.

2070
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:11,940
Doubles pegs within a close range.

2071
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:15,860
But it didn't hit the 500 one, which is why it's kind of interesting.

2072
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,020
The eggs go crazy, for real.

2073
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,340
What the heck?

2074
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,400
Come on, get the thousand, get the thousand, get the thousand.

2075
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:31,160
Nice!

2076
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:34,200
We need cheese house.

2077
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:34,860
We do.

2078
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:36,880
Let me in.

2079
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:37,420
Let me in.

2080
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:38,880
What is that?

2081
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:39,720
The pointer.

2082
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:42,960
Peg fully popped.

2083
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:43,940
Marks a random peg.

2084
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:46,540
When a peg is marked, all pegs have the same number will be doubled.

2085
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:50,100
If no pegs have the same number as the marked peg, a random peg will be doubled.

2086
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:51,840
Wait a second.

2087
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:52,940
I can't get any of these.

2088
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:53,780
I just realized.

2089
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,080
It doesn't let you buy slots here.

2090
02:20:58,940 --> 02:20:59,740
Oh no!

2091
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,490
The alien.

2092
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:08,570
Sell the E.

2093
02:21:08,890 --> 02:21:09,550
Oh, yeah, true.

2094
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:12,010
We could sell the E.

2095
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:13,770
Goodbye.

2096
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:15,570
I guess I would...

2097
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:16,750
We can always get it again.

2098
02:21:17,810 --> 02:21:19,970
I guess I could have sold the finger puppet, too.

2099
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:21,490
I probably don't really need him.

2100
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:27,780
I'm going to re-roll.

2101
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,900
We got the flippy floppies.

2102
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:33,360
We got the floppies.

2103
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:36,400
All perks force trigger the item to the left of me.

2104
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:43,070
Toy fish.

2105
02:21:47,130 --> 02:21:49,470
Two random pegs will copy the number of the first peg popped.

2106
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:53,690
If the item in slot number seven...

2107
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:56,550
If this item is in slot seven, four pegs will be affected instead of two.

2108
02:21:56,950 --> 02:21:57,710
Oh, interesting.

2109
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:02,570
That would have been perfect for E, but we can get it back.

2110
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:03,610
Yeah, we can get it back.

2111
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:05,110
We can get it back.

2112
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:10,210
Yeah, yeah.

2113
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:15,510
Okay.

2114
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:16,990
Oh, we lived.

2115
02:22:18,210 --> 02:22:18,490
Wizard.

2116
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:20,190
Wizard.

2117
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:31,720
What if I get this one and I put, like, 3D glasses or the...

2118
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:39,400
Put the rocks on...

2119
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:41,140
Yeah, these guys on glasses.

2120
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:44,880
We could get this, and then I could put it all the way.

2121
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:52,440
Okay.

2122
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:54,200
Stratosphere time!

2123
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,460
I want to see how far we can go.

2124
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:02,560
Does it work like that?

2125
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:03,860
I have no idea.

2126
02:23:04,580 --> 02:23:06,880
I have no idea.

2127
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:08,860
Maybe.

2128
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:10,100
Uh oh.

2129
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:10,700
Yikes.

2130
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:22,870
Hey!

2131
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:45,100
Nice indeed.

2132
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:47,880
Wait, I could...

2133
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:58,520
upgrade our finger puppet okay hold on first we gotta expand wait i kind of want to upgrade them double the number of the times that dubious bounces around

2134
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:06,320
time to expand i'll expand again why not

2135
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:16,720
springy this oh it uh slot five that's right five percent chance to force trigger item in slot five

2136
02:24:47,480 --> 02:25:16,520
I guess I guess we can have it trigger everything right re-roll let's try whoa what's this guy evil goose peg halved all pegs will give wait oh the peg has to be halved dang it all pegs will give points equal to double the number of the lowest number peg oh that's right it's corrupted it can't be forced you guys are right but I

2137
02:25:21,630 --> 02:25:32,710
can still do this because it forces oh wait, to the left just kidding, I don't know why I thought like all items to the left I'm stupid

2138
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:41,790
asbestos but I have nothing that would have

2139
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:07,700
glasses on five, corrupted on six well, I also got I have I had this, the force trigger, your leftmost item in your inventory.

2140
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:10,860
That's why I have glasses on one.

2141
02:26:16,470 --> 02:26:17,670
Chicken on five?

2142
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:23,450
Yeah, I feel like, you know, we could do that.

2143
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:28,270
I think I'll just get this...

2144
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:30,350
I don't want to just buy to buy, you know?

2145
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:36,550
I kind of want to see what the bug does.

2146
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:39,730
I want to see what the metamorphosizes.

2147
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:44,290
Squirmy.

2148
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:49,690
If I buy another slot, we could go to the cafe.

2149
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:52,250
Oh, strawberry!

2150
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:55,030
Ring.

2151
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,910
Then I'm going to reroll.

2152
02:26:59,090 --> 02:26:59,690
Strawberry!

2153
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:02,890
Ring.

2154
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:11,430

2159
02:28:26,310 --> 02:28:26,730
Oh, sorry.

2160
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,910
This did kind of...

2161
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:30,870
As soon as I said it, I was like, wait, it kind of sounds like I'm ending the stream.

2162
02:28:31,490 --> 02:28:32,650
I was like, I'm going to call in here.

2163
02:28:32,890 --> 02:28:33,630
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2164
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:36,170
Slot 3.

2165
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:40,470
I think the ray gun would be good.

2166
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:42,010
Candle sounds good.

2167
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:46,270
Oh, well, actually, no, wait.

2168
02:28:47,370 --> 02:28:47,730
But...

2169
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:50,370
Oh, maybe we could, like, clear a map with Slot.

2170
02:28:50,490 --> 02:28:50,730
Okay.

2171
02:28:51,390 --> 02:28:51,750
Okay.

2172
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:56,870
I can't decide.

2173
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:57,690
They're both pretty good.

2174
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:04,010
Candle only fires if you pass anyway.

2175
02:29:04,210 --> 02:29:04,890
That's how I feel.

2176
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:12,930
I would rather get something that can save me from death rather than like if we're certain of...

2177
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:17,230
Certain of... I guess it would help us restock lives if we needed it.

2178
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:19,030
I'm gonna get the ray gun though.

2179
02:29:22,090 --> 02:29:22,650
Dug.

2180
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:47,980
holy cow the eggs go crazy what do we have here any strawberries strobe 50% chance to force trigger the rightmost item which would be him the rubber chicken rubber chickens gonna just gonna go

2181
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:58,580
free coin Free coin?

2182
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:02,160
Seal and asbestos.

2183
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:07,640
I still haven't properly tried them, so...

2184
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:09,580
Wait, can I... Yeah, I can't get both.

2185
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,420
Let's try it.

2186
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:20,200
How does the rubber chicken go?

2187
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:24,440
The rubber chicken is like dropping all the eggs that are causing the explosions.

2188
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,520
Every half second, like it's crazy good.

2189
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:31,300
I'm gonna re-roll and see.

2190
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,340
Cheese house!

2191
02:30:34,180 --> 02:30:37,820
We're at 30, so it will actually benefit us for right now.

2192
02:30:46,930 --> 02:30:48,610
Cheese house!

2193
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:54,770
Cheese house!

2194
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:57,210
Holy moly.

2195
02:31:13,150 --> 02:31:14,870
This game looks so peak.

2196
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:16,750
It's so fun, actually.

2197
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:21,330
Gosh, I'm like super into these types of games recently.

2198
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:27,030
Oh my god, we got the almost...

2199
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:27,450
Mega!

2200
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:28,490
Super score!

2201
02:31:30,890 --> 02:31:31,450
Wow.

2202
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:33,630
Asbestos.

2203
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:41,720
Rogue Lakes are fun.

2204
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:42,500
They are!

2205
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,020
Oh!

2206
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:48,340
Saved it to buy it later, right?

2207
02:31:55,360 --> 02:31:57,160
Stocks a random rare food item.

2208
02:31:58,900 --> 02:31:59,500
Whoa!

2209
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:00,540
Avocado!

2210
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:05,020
Gains 1% odds for rare items across all shops.

2211
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:08,320
This does not increase odds of ultra-rare items.

2212
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:19,490
Avocado good, is it?

2213
02:32:21,490 --> 02:32:24,010
I guess 1% is better than no percent.

2214
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:29,900
what if i got this one too

2215
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:47,660
it's risky i know i might not be able to afford it i might not be able to afford it

2216
02:32:50,680 --> 02:33:01,360
stack the rares well what if i get what if it's like 10 i can't afford it oh wait i would be able to afford if it's 10 let's eat it

2217
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,960
I can't afford it!

2218
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:18,080
10 pegs have has an x% chance to force trigger the item in slot 3 for each remaining life gain.

2219
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,120
25% odds.

2220
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:21,380
Sheesh.

2221
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:27,480
They really want me to take the skull.

2222
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:32,660
So

2223
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,620
far though, we got a pretty good setup.

2224
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,860
So far, though, our setup is not so bad.

2225
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,220
We're pretty cozy right now.

2226
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:48,760
We're pretty cozy.

2227
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:50,320
Moap!

2228
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:51,560
What does that do?

2229
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:56,780
When pop for the first time, this peg will trigger a mega explosion that pops all pegs at once!

2230
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:06,580
Moap!

2231
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:07,940
Handle it!

2232
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:10,180
I miss balloons.

2233
02:34:14,990 --> 02:34:17,050
Our setup is pretty cozy right now.

2234
02:34:19,970 --> 02:34:22,750
Oh my gosh, I want the kidney bean!

2235
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:35,570
Bloons was sacrificed for Druids.

2236
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:40,020
What happened to Bloons?

2237
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:42,060
Nothing, I just haven't played it in a bit.

2238
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:44,020
Sell Cheese House?

2239
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:45,300
I think we can, honestly.

2240
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:50,250
Oh wait, if I sold that, and then maybe I could...

2241
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:55,280
Sell cheese for Jax.

2242
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,760
Elmo, I'm trusting you.

2243
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:00,700
Let's try it.

2244
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:01,980
Let's try it, baby.

2245
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:05,780
Let's sell cheese for Jax.

2246
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:08,940
Sell this guy too.

2247
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:12,660
Oh yeah, I think our finger puppet probably doesn't do so much either.

2248
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,840
Like, I'm guessing, like, so he has...

2249
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,400
He's been activated 46 times.

2250
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:19,220
So what, he gives us 86 points?

2251
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:22,060
Like, that's nothing for what we need, you know?

2252
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:23,460
Oh.

2253
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:27,040
I'm still in a dream.

2254
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:27,860
Elmo.

2255
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:34,810
With Jackson 3.

2256
02:35:36,770 --> 02:35:38,270
I just listened to you.

2257
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:40,010
Oh no!

2258
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:44,950
I'm gonna sell him.

2259
02:35:50,030 --> 02:35:51,670
I probably should have moved.

2260
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:52,610
Hold on, never mind.

2261
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:16,680
Eat the bean I would have How much?

2262
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:17,940
16?

2263
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:32,400
16 16 I would have 16 If I eat the bean The croissant The croissant was 17, oh?

2264
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:37,860
Part of me wants to reroll and part of me wants to eat the bean.

2265
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:39,720
Yeah.

2266
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:42,000
Aquasio.

2267
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Yeah, it was 17.

2268
02:36:44,420 --> 02:36:45,600
I don't know if it's worth it.

2269
02:36:47,220 --> 02:36:47,860
I'm gonna reroll.

2270
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:49,660
It's gonna hurt, but I'm gonna reroll.

2271
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:51,520
Oh!

2272
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:52,860
We could get free.

2273
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:58,620
Do these stock?

2274
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:02,560
The kebabs?

2275
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:07,140
Yes.

2276
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:09,640
They do.

2277
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:10,080
Okay.

2278
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:14,040
What could I put in the most?

2279
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:16,760
What does it do?

2280
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,200
50% chance to force trigger the rightmost item.

2281
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:34,770
Every time a perk triggers, it also triggers glasses.

2282
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:39,900
It is on death.

2283
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:41,180
Yeah, that's why I'm, like, wondering.

2284
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:43,500
I don't think it would be worth it for the asbestos.

2285
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:44,420
But I don't know.

2286
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,840
If Happy Seal would be...

2287
02:37:47,860 --> 02:38:13,840
either I think we have wait hold on no I don't think Jack's should be well it is 50% chance versus a 40% chance but this is also if it if Nubby dies so I think I'm gonna hold off for now we

2288
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:26,180
could get it and then get something better later yeah I think we'll get it just so that we have the perk.

2289
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:28,280
You know, it doesn't have to...

2290
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:33,380
It doesn't have to always be, you know, immediate.

2291
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:35,580
Okay.

2292
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:37,000
All right.

2293
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:37,880
All right.

2294
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:49,180
Crazer!

2295
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:52,380
What is this one?

2296
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:52,900
Oh, yeah.

2297
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:54,000
It's a...

2298
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:54,940
It's a...

2299
02:38:57,160 --> 02:38:58,200
It's a...

2300
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:59,420
It's a...

2301
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:00,680
What's the word?

2302
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:01,560
Fragile.

2303
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:03,180
Fragile little guy.

2304
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:04,520
Oh, but this one's new.

2305
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:05,520
House of Cardsburg.

2306
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:07,080
15 pegs popped.

2307
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:09,480
Force triggers all X popped items.

2308
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,040
Do we have any X popped?

2309
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:14,160
Would first popped count?

2310
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:16,740
20 pegs popped.

2311
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:22,440
Force triggers all items that summon anything, which we only have the espice dose.

2312
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:25,280
No, dang.

2313
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,460
This one, a seal would count, though.

2314
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,440
So seal counts.

2315
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:47,280

02:40:53,980 --> 02:40:55,440
Oh, we got the same one.

2324
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,680
Does this also stack?

2325
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,360
So would it also be like...

2326
02:40:58,360 --> 02:40:59,140
Is it 50-50?

2327
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:03,300
I mean, we have so much money right now.

2328
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:04,120
I think it's fine.

2329
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:05,000
More kebab.

2330
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:06,640
More kebab.

2331
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:07,320
More kebab.

2332
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:09,860
The bean.

2333
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:10,520
The bean.

2334
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:11,100
The bean.

2335
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,540
What do we get?

2336
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,300
A lentil.

2337
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:17,560
Randomizes all items in your inventory.

2338
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:23,720
Oh.

2339
02:41:24,460 --> 02:41:25,000
Um.

2340
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:37,520
That was not so good.

2341
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:44,120
That was a random peg.

2342
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:46,300
I'm going to reroll.

2343
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:48,380
Tate.

2344
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:51,160
100% chance to...

2345
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:54,480
Oh my god.

2346
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:57,860
We're going to get so many jacks and so many.

2347
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:04,520
Oh my god.

2348
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,580
But it has to force trigger.

2349
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:12,860
But it has to force trigger.

2350
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:36,100
Never mind.

2351
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:39,560
I

2352
02:42:43,910 --> 02:42:46,750
mean, I could always just grab something for now.

2353
02:42:49,390 --> 02:42:49,970
Could grab goose.

2354
02:42:50,130 --> 02:42:50,670
What's the goose here?

2355
02:42:51,370 --> 02:42:51,850
Pecks have.

2356
02:42:51,930 --> 02:42:55,170
All pecks will give points equal as ever the number to the closest number peg.

2357
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:07,260
You got a rat reload.

2358
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:08,160
Did I?

2359
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:14,180
Yeah, let's do that.

2360
02:43:14,180 --> 02:43:14,900
But aren't I?

2361
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:17,740
Rebow!

2362
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:22,360
Oh, oh, oh, uh, uh, I don't know.

2363
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:23,860
Hmm.

2364
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:28,740
Let's just grab a goose, I suppose.

2365
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:32,440
Tehranimou!

2366
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:33,480
Welcome back!

2367
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,540
Thank you!

2368
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:36,220
More asbestos.

2369
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:39,880
Asbestos for more drops?

2370
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:40,580
I guess that's true.

2371
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:43,480
Let's try.

2372
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:47,340
We're trying, baby.

2373
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:50,180
Oh my god.

2374
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:51,320
Oh my god.

2375
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:52,720
Oh my god.

2376
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:54,160
Oh my god.

2377
02:43:55,500 --> 02:44:07,100
Oh my

2378
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:17,260
god.

2379
02:44:24,630 --> 02:44:27,070
This is so crazy.

2380
02:44:27,090 --> 02:44:27,710
Crazy!

2381
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:38,140
Whoa!

2382
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:39,820
Tornado perk!

2383
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:42,580
Force triggers the leftmost item by two times?

2384
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:45,780
Jumbling pegs increases x by plus two?

2385
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:48,820
Okay.

2386
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:51,040
The mystery one.

2387
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:51,860
Oh no no no.

2388
02:44:52,060 --> 02:44:52,360
Okay.

2389
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:56,060
This is why we love me though!

2390
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:59,680
And it would do the glasses.

2391
02:45:06,270 --> 02:45:06,870
Okay.

2392
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:07,010
Okay.

2393
02:45:18,930 --> 02:45:20,970
Holy cow.

2394
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:22,390
Holy cow.

2395
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:24,730
This is ridiculous.

2396
02:45:25,250 --> 02:45:26,390
It's ridiculous.

2397
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:37,210
Um...

2398
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:40,530
I'm going to the cafe.

2399
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:43,450
I'm eating a mouse.

2400
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:45,930
I'm going back.

2401
02:45:46,430 --> 02:45:47,190
I'm re-rolling.

2402
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,280
This one, if we're clearing boards...

2403
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:11,980
Oh, the asbestos!

2404
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:12,480
That's right!

2405
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:19,120
Asbestos.

2406
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:21,560
Asbestos.

2407
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:22,860
And then I'm going to reroll.

2408
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:24,020
And...

2409
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:26,700
And...

2410
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:28,200
Eight, eight, eight, eight.

2411
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:30,560
Not that I need more coins, but, you know.

2412
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:32,720
I want to upgrade my jacks.

2413
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:39,740
Yippee!

2414
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:55,500
Where would I put the E though?

2415
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,480
Wait, wait, hold on.

2416
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:58,460
Force trigger this item.

2417
02:46:58,660 --> 02:47:02,000
When this is force trigger, it transfers the force trigger to the item to the left of me.

2418
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:05,000
There's a 15% chance to add an additional force trigger.

2419
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:11,640
Do the two fuse?

2420
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:12,620
I don't think so.

2421
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:13,920
No.

2422
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:24,150
Jax to 7 for Euphoria?

2423
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:32,670
jacks on the 40 the ray gun was for seven I

2424
02:47:37,970 --> 02:47:41,890
don't have anything for seven keep

2425
02:47:47,000 --> 02:48:04,140
triggering for ultra rare that's how I feel seven is right most wait what do I have for right most I have left most oh the kebab I guess we could switch them Both, right?

2426
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:08,100
I mean, we have multiple espices.

2427
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:20,960
No rare.

2428
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:21,900
No ultra rare.

2429
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:25,440
Okay.

2430
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,700
Here they come.

2431
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:34,380
Here they come.

2432
02:48:38,980 --> 02:48:41,220
You broke the game!

2433
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:43,560
Oh my god!

2434
02:48:47,020 --> 02:48:49,780
Do you guys see my score?

2435
02:48:55,140 --> 02:48:56,700
Booker party!

2436
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:08,500
Nubtastic.

2437
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:16,780
I know she isn't...

2438
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:17,620
This isn't gambling!

2439
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:18,520
This isn't gambling!

2440
02:49:22,780 --> 02:49:24,080
Oh my god.

2441
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:27,420
gosh we get something next time though wait

2442
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:39,500

2444
02:50:11,650 --> 02:50:28,960
Random I mean rare rare rare rare Rare rare rare rare Okay skip Skip Rare rare rare rare Skip.

2445
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,440
Okay, we got the key at least.

2446
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:38,520
Oh, take the key.

2447
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,200
Don't skip.

2448
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:41,720
All right.

2449
02:50:48,410 --> 02:50:50,310
Here it comes.

2450
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:52,670
Oh my gosh.

2451
02:50:54,310 --> 02:50:55,310
What trillion?

2452
02:50:56,650 --> 02:50:57,890
I broke the game again?

2453
02:51:00,410 --> 02:51:03,310
This is actually kind of insane.

2454
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:06,810
There we go.

2455
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:16,070
Guys.

2456
02:51:19,270 --> 02:51:20,490
There we go.

2457
02:51:26,570 --> 02:51:30,830
This is like, this is like to offset my Clover Pit luck, I feel.

2458
02:51:32,590 --> 02:51:34,250
Now you know how to do the ultimate.

2459
02:51:34,270 --> 02:51:38,270
built in Nubi's Number Factory.

2460
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:41,170
This is a guide.

2461
02:51:45,300 --> 02:51:45,920
No!

2462
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:49,220
No!

2463
02:51:49,780 --> 02:51:50,740
No rare!

2464
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:54,200
Lion would be proud.

2465
02:51:56,900 --> 02:51:59,740
You know, we always kill the game when the score starts using letters.

2466
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:00,760
At least it's not E.

2467
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:08,780
You can potentially upgrade your corrupted item and Three, re-roll.

2468
02:52:09,980 --> 02:52:10,260
Yeah.

2469
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:13,820
Yeah, let's re-roll and see.

2470
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:15,680
Oh, dang it.

2471
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:16,860
I thought that was it for a second.

2472
02:52:17,400 --> 02:52:17,840
No!

2473
02:52:32,360 --> 02:52:32,840
Um.

2474
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:40,560
I think fly is good, but I think I want to keep this one still.

2475
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:43,480
Yeah, I have a good build.

2476
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:45,320
Right now, it's very...

2477
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:54,340
Right now, it's...

2478
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:55,380
It's doing us good.

2479
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:56,540
We're very comfy.

2480
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:58,120
We're, like, cruising right now.

2481
02:52:58,740 --> 02:53:00,420
We're, like, actually just cruising.

2482
02:53:01,100 --> 02:53:01,760
What is this one?

2483
02:53:01,940 --> 02:53:04,700
This peg will subtract points instead of adding points when popped.

2484
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:06,080
Oh, my gosh!

2485
02:53:06,140 --> 02:53:06,600
So many!

2486
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:12,130
And it's...

2487
02:53:12,130 --> 02:53:12,730
Oh, okay, good.

2488
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:18,290
Oh, no!

2489
02:53:18,470 --> 02:53:18,730
Oh, no!

2490
02:53:19,010 --> 02:53:20,070
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2491
02:53:20,550 --> 02:53:21,410
We made it!

2492
02:53:21,470 --> 02:53:21,610
Okay.

2493
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:24,130
I was scared for a second.

2494
02:53:25,070 --> 02:53:26,590
Don't scare me like that!

2495
02:53:28,750 --> 02:53:31,290
It was so over for like two seconds.

2496
02:53:33,130 --> 02:53:33,870
Force triggers all Nubby.

2497
02:53:34,090 --> 02:53:34,810
What do I have?

2498
02:53:34,910 --> 02:53:35,770
I don't...

2499
02:53:36,530 --> 02:53:39,150
I was gonna say, I don't think I have any Nubby dies.

2500
02:53:40,270 --> 02:53:41,190
Springy Park!

2501
02:53:43,090 --> 02:53:44,010
Sun Temple.

2502
02:53:45,050 --> 02:53:47,850
Guys, we've made it to a new land!

2503
02:53:52,690 --> 02:53:54,390
Double springy, double springy.

2504
02:54:00,490 --> 02:54:01,330
Heg mania!

2505
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:11,670
I don't even look at the score anymore.

2506
02:54:13,510 --> 02:54:16,270
I just wanted to know that you helped me through a very typical fun!

2507
02:54:17,030 --> 02:54:19,430
Keep being gringy and goofy and freaky.

2508
02:54:19,790 --> 02:54:20,790
Always looking forward to your streams.

2509
02:54:20,970 --> 02:54:21,590
Thank you!

2510
02:54:22,490 --> 02:54:23,470
Thank you!

2511
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:27,310
Oh, there we go.

2512
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:28,290
There it goes.

2513
02:54:37,820 --> 02:54:38,380
Guys.

2514
02:54:41,890 --> 02:54:44,050
I don't even, I don't even know.

2515
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:51,480
We've broken the system.

2516
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:55,760
Those pretty colors.

2517
02:54:56,220 --> 02:54:58,380
It's like we're watching fireworks together.

2518
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:06,360
Oh!

2519
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:12,660
Let's reroll.

2520
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:13,940
Wait.

2521
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:16,840
Yeah, let's try and get the 3D glasses.

2522
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,800
Okay.

2523
02:55:18,820 --> 02:55:19,580
And the chicken.

2524
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:22,800
Oh!

2525
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:25,220
Lobster Clow.

2526
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:28,680
Baby sensory video type gameplay.

2527
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:35,700
Does the sound drown out the confession too?

2528
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:37,360
Yeah, actually.

2529
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:40,900
Yeah, I think 99 is the...

2530
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:44,480
is the max number of coin.

2531
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,240
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna...

2532
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:53,760
It hurts to re-roll because we have a rare, but...

2533
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:56,660
And I'm going to re-roll here.

2534
02:55:57,880 --> 02:55:59,120
Huge, huge, huge.

2535
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:02,060
50% chance to trigger the right most item!

2536
02:56:17,060 --> 02:56:17,500
Onwards.

2537
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:25,280
The lobster claw isn't very good anyway.

2538
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:38,480
It's funny because I watch the score go down because of the drainer perk, but it's funny that...

2539
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:41,340
Like, it still works so well.

2540
02:56:41,780 --> 02:56:44,220
I mean, if you clear the board, you have to win, right?

2541
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:50,500
Oh, a mystery is happening.

2542
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:52,320
Don't touch me.

2543
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:55,140
When popped for the first time, all other pegs will be doubled?

2544
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:58,180
75% chance or halved.

2545
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:00,180
Okay.

2546
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:01,440
Spooky.

2547
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:05,740
I don't know what happened.

2548
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:12,940
Um, they were something.

2549
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:15,840
Something happened.

2550
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,780
Oh my gosh, we're at 1.4 billion.

2551
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:20,520
Wait, the scores are actually probably going to get...

2552
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:22,880
We really need to upgrade our stuff then.

2553
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:24,500
Oh.

2554
02:57:34,480 --> 02:57:36,840
Because we're getting 50 billion right now.

2555
02:57:36,940 --> 02:57:39,780
but soon it's gonna get to that amount, you know what I mean?

2556
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:40,860
Oh!

2557
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:45,700
We can get the tornado perk again!

2558
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:48,020
Wait, but...

2559
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:49,860
We could also get... I think... Oh, geez.

2560
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:51,560
I think...

2561
02:57:52,980 --> 02:57:54,660
I think the tornado...

2562
02:57:54,660 --> 02:57:55,640
It stacks, right?

2563
02:57:57,360 --> 02:57:57,800
So...

2564
02:58:02,480 --> 02:58:04,640
I keep forgetting to jumble the pegs.

2565
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:08,000
We need more glasses, we do.

2566
02:58:10,460 --> 02:58:13,320
I'll start jumbling them just so I can remember.

2567
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:24,740
ABJ always... No, no, no, no, ABJ!

2568
02:58:24,940 --> 02:58:26,680
No, no, no, no, no!

2569
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:31,260
Huge.

2570
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:38,340
Quasar!

2571
02:58:43,420 --> 02:58:45,120
We can finally afford it.

2572
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:50,870
Just keep eating it, I guess.

2573
02:58:51,690 --> 02:58:54,710
Oh, wait, I'm gonna run out of coins, I just realized.

2574
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:04,520
Oh, we did the Quasso do.

2575
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:09,420
Has an X% chance to force trigger the item in slot number 3.

2576
02:59:14,180 --> 02:59:15,360
I could get the reroll.

2577
02:59:21,970 --> 02:59:23,990
We really need the glasses or the chicken.

2578
02:59:24,090 --> 02:59:25,490
Our rare odds are going up, though.

2579
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:26,290
So that's good.

2580
02:59:27,130 --> 02:59:28,250
But we really need those.

2581
02:59:30,230 --> 02:59:31,290
Oh, I forgot to...

2582
02:59:31,290 --> 02:59:32,710
I forgot to jumble.

2583
02:59:35,790 --> 02:59:37,970
Seal on three and look for this.

2584
02:59:44,150 --> 02:59:45,110
I could try.

2585
02:59:51,350 --> 02:59:53,570
As long as I think having the...

2586
02:59:54,670 --> 02:59:55,310
Holy...

2587
02:59:55,310 --> 02:59:56,490
We got the Q!

2588
03:00:03,690 --> 03:00:04,970
What is it?

2589
03:00:04,990 --> 03:00:22,230
the queue when this peg this peg will multiply your total points why 1.5 times when popped for the first time okay okay quadrillion

2590
03:00:25,710 --> 03:00:49,850
how far can we get you guys how far do you think we can get in this Eventually, obviously, we would have to run out because if we can't upgrade our stuff anymore.

2591
03:00:56,310 --> 03:00:58,570
But the sound is starting to break even.

2592
03:01:00,730 --> 03:01:01,630
What is this guy?

2593
03:01:01,770 --> 03:01:02,530
Oh, poop butt.

2594
03:01:05,050 --> 03:01:06,010
Poop butt.

2595
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:13,040
Oh, I should have probably...

2596
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:14,120
Why did I do him first?

2597
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:15,040
Oops, my bad.

2598
03:01:16,980 --> 03:01:18,600
Stocks are random ultra rare for...

2599
03:01:18,620 --> 03:01:19,460
Items!

2600
03:01:21,960 --> 03:01:24,160
Duplicates the most recently obtained perk.

2601
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:25,880
The kebab perk.

2602
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:31,320
There is a final level.

2603
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:31,660
Oh.

2604
03:01:37,720 --> 03:01:39,040
Might as well, yeah.

2605
03:01:47,620 --> 03:01:48,140
What is this?

2606
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:50,120
Mimics the effect of the most recently eaten...

2607
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,500
Wait, so it'll summon an...

2608
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:53,400
Wait, how much is this guy?

2609
03:01:53,460 --> 03:01:54,140
Oh, it's only six.

2610
03:01:55,740 --> 03:01:56,220
No!

2611
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,000
Get away from me, Lentol!

2612
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:04,370
Oh, we got the nose!

2613
03:02:16,590 --> 03:02:19,250
I'm thinking maybe...

2614
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:24,400
The pebbles.

2615
03:02:24,960 --> 03:02:25,140
These?

2616
03:02:25,360 --> 03:02:26,100
The flippy flobbies?

2617
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:27,380
Is that what you mean?

2618
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:35,860
Flippy flobbies forces this to...

2619
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,860
The glasses to...

2620
03:02:40,800 --> 03:02:42,760
It force triggers them.

2621
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:44,480
But...

2622
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:55,540
Only activated Y and say, ah, okay.

2623
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:00,440
It only does it Y and say, ah.

2624
03:03:01,940 --> 03:03:03,120
I'm selling it.

2625
03:03:04,980 --> 03:03:06,360
We keep the flibby flobbies.

2626
03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:07,280
They're keeping us alive.

2627
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:10,560
I don't think the flibby flobbies are the thing keeping us alive.

2628
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:19,940
Keep flibby flobbies.

2629
03:03:20,100 --> 03:03:21,520
Maybe I don't quite understand.

2630
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:30,640
This, though, the doubles, pegs is kind of helping us alive.

2631
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:52,800
because the high we need we need the double pegs to go off like multiple times because that's how we're getting into the trillions yeah the doubling is exactly what like obviously we could clear a board but if the board it does not have a high enough of a score then it's then it's not gonna do anything

2632
03:03:56,020 --> 03:04:06,340
so that's why we need it i think i'm gonna re-roll i think we gotta I think we have to aim for chicken or for more glasses.

2633
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:10,640
Something that will keep the scores going up.

2634
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:14,600
Boards will have enough.

2635
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:28,220
Try swapping seal and glasses.

2636
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:52,940
I'll try it.

2637
03:04:57,050 --> 03:04:57,990
I'll try it.

2638
03:05:03,880 --> 03:05:05,100
I'm going to reroll.

2639
03:05:09,900 --> 03:05:12,780
No, why can't you be chicken?

2640
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:15,360
Chicken is just rare, right?

2641
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:15,720
Yeah.

2642
03:05:18,220 --> 03:05:20,920
But we're starting to see more rare items, so...

2643
03:05:32,170 --> 03:05:34,110
But so far, we're okay, though.

2644
03:05:34,690 --> 03:05:35,110
So far.

2645
03:05:36,750 --> 03:05:37,690
Oh, my gosh.

2646
03:05:39,570 --> 03:05:41,470
So far, we're doing all right.

2647
03:05:44,470 --> 03:05:46,730
I love when we break the sound.

2648
03:05:46,750 --> 03:05:47,750
Not even.

2649
03:06:01,300 --> 03:06:01,860
Well...

2650
03:06:01,860 --> 03:06:02,720
Oh, that's right.

2651
03:06:08,910 --> 03:06:09,750
This one.

2652
03:06:12,910 --> 03:06:15,610
I like to go for the lowest so that this will...

2653
03:06:15,610 --> 03:06:17,770
so the glasses will trigger the double...

2654
03:06:19,890 --> 03:06:21,010
the double...

2655
03:06:21,010 --> 03:06:21,890
pegs.

2656
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:25,390
So if you're wondering why I'm like aiming for lower ones.

2657
03:06:25,390 --> 03:06:28,750
because it'll make the other ones that are higher even higher

2658
03:06:31,930 --> 03:06:57,230
glasses i think glasses and one is was better i think you're right i'm gonna switch up oh dave 50 chance to double coins 50 chance to set total coins to zero i see How many 50% chances could we even get more for the kebab?

2659
03:06:59,590 --> 03:07:03,790
Dave, I'm not gonna pick you because I'm not gambling.

2660
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:09,030
My coins, yeah, my coins are even maxed out, so it doesn't matter.

2661
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:13,750
Stocks are random, much are rare, food item.

2662
03:07:14,950 --> 03:07:15,610
No, no, no.

2663
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:21,630
You can jumble pegs plus one plus additional time.

2664
03:07:21,650 --> 03:07:22,210
per turn.

2665
03:07:22,650 --> 03:07:24,650
Oh, why not?

2666
03:07:27,990 --> 03:07:28,910
Plus one jumbo.

2667
03:07:31,530 --> 03:07:31,970
Okay.

2668
03:07:34,790 --> 03:07:35,390
Stop.

2669
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:36,750
Get away from me.

2670
03:07:42,020 --> 03:07:43,680
Wait, we could re-roll here.

2671
03:07:48,290 --> 03:07:49,230
No, Dave.

2672
03:07:49,490 --> 03:07:49,930
No.

2673
03:07:52,590 --> 03:07:53,630
No, Dave, no.

2674
03:07:59,150 --> 03:08:06,830
Okay, this is how you And re-roll This is how you Oh my gosh, wait, this is crazy

2675
03:08:11,410 --> 03:08:22,030
More coins Then we re-roll here Whoa, Yeti Every peg will give Points equal to 15% of their Number

2676
03:08:31,430 --> 03:08:35,690
Hinako Wait, that's Actually, hold on.

2677
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:45,960
Should we get rid of one of the asbestos for Yeti?

2678
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:49,480
I'm excited to wear my minke cosplay!

2679
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:51,040
Have you liked my minke board?

2680
03:08:51,400 --> 03:08:51,740
Yeah!

2681
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:53,440
It was so cute!

2682
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:55,280
Oh my gosh, Melody, thank you!

2683
03:08:58,200 --> 03:08:59,620
What triggers this?

2684
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:00,840
First peg popped.

2685
03:09:10,850 --> 03:09:13,830
If asbestos doesn't count as pop, maybe swap it out for Super Jax.

2686
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:22,260
It does not count.

2687
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:27,140
Oh, I forgot that this gives 12 to 18% of the gold.

2688
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:29,820
That's why we're, like, swimming in cash.

2689
03:09:31,700 --> 03:09:33,220
Yeah, asbestos is pretty good.

2690
03:09:37,990 --> 03:09:38,850
Whatever's doing least.

2691
03:09:39,110 --> 03:09:41,790
It feels like everything is doing a ton.

2692
03:09:42,150 --> 03:09:45,250
Because we need the pegs half, so we need the seal.

2693
03:09:45,250 --> 03:09:48,290
I mean

2694
03:09:53,570 --> 03:10:09,970
Jax is only when you pass the round goal I think Jax is getting a little tricky because we're reaching the we're gonna start reaching the round goal less less

2695
03:10:16,970 --> 03:10:22,750
but it also gets forced triggered oh that's true we have a uh

2696
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:36,030
Force triggers all items that summon anything So it does summon I mean we do have that we do have that So never mind

2697
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:43,160
Yeah, bypasses.

2698
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:59,980
Yeah, and we do have the kebab also Which is a 50% chance to force trigger But everything already triggers It's already force triggers Phoebe, thank you for the redirect.

2699
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:05,760
Thank you, thank you.

2700
03:11:06,020 --> 03:11:08,840
Okay, I won't get the Yeti then, but we will grab this.

2701
03:11:09,360 --> 03:11:11,760
And we will eat and we will re-roll glasses.

2702
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:13,820
No, not.

2703
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:17,500
Okay, let's just keep going then.

2704
03:11:21,100 --> 03:11:21,620
I

2705
03:11:26,060 --> 03:11:28,340
mean, we're still doing pretty dang good.

2706
03:11:29,820 --> 03:11:32,120
Piper bags, thank you so much for the gift.

2707
03:11:34,660 --> 03:11:36,160
Jacob, thank you for the gift.

2708
03:11:36,820 --> 03:11:37,760
Say, say, thank you for the gift.

2709
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:38,460
I'm gifted.

2710
03:11:38,620 --> 03:11:39,500
Phil, thank you for the gift.

2711
03:11:39,780 --> 03:11:40,040
Whoa.

2712
03:11:40,600 --> 03:11:40,960
Tony!

2713
03:11:42,400 --> 03:11:44,060
Tony shoots lasers from his eyes.

2714
03:11:44,200 --> 03:11:47,040
If a peg is hit by a laser, its number will be reduced to one.

2715
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:49,680
Where's Tony?

2716
03:11:58,850 --> 03:11:59,510
Oh, God.

2717
03:12:00,190 --> 03:12:00,390
Oh.

2718
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:02,010
We're okay.

2719
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:23,040
Oh, my gosh.

2720
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:24,840
If anybody wants to see it, there you go.

2721
03:12:25,460 --> 03:12:26,640
If you're like, I want to play it.

2722
03:12:26,740 --> 03:12:27,780
I want to win.

2723
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:28,800
I want to beat the game, too.

2724
03:12:40,740 --> 03:12:41,080
Aaron!

2725
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:43,200
Thank you so much for the toani!

2726
03:12:46,760 --> 03:12:47,060
I think.

2727
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:48,100
Wait, someone else.

2728
03:12:48,820 --> 03:12:50,420
Ahab, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

2729
03:12:50,600 --> 03:12:51,180
Akia, stay up through.

2730
03:12:51,220 --> 03:12:52,060
Thank you so much for the gifted.

2731
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,280
Nawa, thank you for the 10 gifted.

2732
03:12:53,540 --> 03:12:53,900
Thank you guys.

2733
03:12:54,020 --> 03:12:54,800
Sorry if I missed any.

2734
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:56,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

2735
03:12:56,840 --> 03:12:57,780
Another game clear?

2736
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:58,480
Does this count?

2737
03:12:59,860 --> 03:13:00,980
Another one for your goal.

2738
03:13:01,820 --> 03:13:05,760
This, I mean, I counted Peggle in my example, so maybe this counts too, right?

2739
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:08,400
That's my whole shame.

2740
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:10,180
We say, oh, nothing is...

2741
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:11,980
This is number factory!

2742
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:16,440
We are literally making numbers.

2743
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:21,480
If Peggle can count, this can count.

2744
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:25,420
I didn't expect to beat it.

2745
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:26,720
Let's go!

2746
03:13:29,620 --> 03:13:30,660
Well guys.

2747
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:34,000
I think though.

2748
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:37,400
I don't think I'm gonna die any times.

2749
03:13:41,860 --> 03:13:43,860
I'm gonna get to the next...

2750
03:13:49,290 --> 03:13:49,850
Uh...

2751
03:13:49,850 --> 03:13:50,370
Re-roll.

2752
03:13:51,590 --> 03:13:52,150
None.

2753
03:13:57,590 --> 03:13:58,450
Re-roll.

2754
03:13:59,550 --> 03:14:00,110
None.

2755
03:14:02,270 --> 03:14:03,430
Go up to a hundred?

2756
03:14:03,670 --> 03:14:05,110
We can try- we can in for a hundred.

2757
03:14:08,790 --> 03:14:09,910
Seven coins!

2758
03:14:10,170 --> 03:14:10,570
Re-roll.

2759
03:14:11,010 --> 03:14:11,310
Whoa!

2760
03:14:12,250 --> 03:14:13,450
Uh, you re-roll?

2761
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:17,250
Go away, Dave!

2762
03:14:17,410 --> 03:14:18,310
Go away, Dave!

2763
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:27,290
It ramps up pretty quickly.

2764
03:14:27,990 --> 03:14:28,690
I'm just kidding.

2765
03:14:28,930 --> 03:14:30,650
I want it to be an even 10.

2766
03:14:33,010 --> 03:14:35,110
I could take the risk.

2767
03:14:35,790 --> 03:14:38,530
But I'm not gambling because YouTube says it's wrong.

2768
03:14:39,210 --> 03:14:40,130
So did my mom.

2769
03:14:44,020 --> 03:14:45,460
Happy bladed Oshidemi, though.

2770
03:14:45,560 --> 03:14:46,520
Thank you, John.

2771
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:47,960
Thank you.

2772
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:52,520
We're board clearing, baby.

2773
03:14:52,900 --> 03:14:53,860
We're board clearing.

2774
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:58,280
Oh yeah, let's start reshuffling and stuff too.

2775
03:15:01,880 --> 03:15:04,980
Let's try and get to 100 and then I'll call it.

2776
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:10,960
Like we're getting to the T's.

2777
03:15:14,380 --> 03:15:16,160
It's mayhem.

2778
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:17,420
Oh yeah.

2779
03:15:27,730 --> 03:15:30,010
Unless asbestos stops working in endless.

2780
03:15:30,690 --> 03:15:32,450
I don't think so.

2781
03:15:33,590 --> 03:15:34,690
I don't think so.

2782
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:35,830
What?

2783
03:15:37,490 --> 03:15:38,670
That's what I'm wondering.

2784
03:15:39,850 --> 03:15:42,390
We have, like, a most insane build?

2785
03:15:43,110 --> 03:15:44,370
Look at the things in the background.

2786
03:15:44,630 --> 03:15:46,090
There's, like, a, there was, like, a guy.

2787
03:15:46,430 --> 03:15:47,050
Oh, there he is.

2788
03:15:54,220 --> 03:15:55,140
Oh, I got loot.

2789
03:15:57,340 --> 03:15:57,820
What?

2790
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:00,540
Force triggers the item in slot 7.

2791
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:02,960
One time for every 10 food items we've consumed.

2792
03:16:03,260 --> 03:16:05,720
Oh my gosh, 61 times.

2793
03:16:08,340 --> 03:16:09,520
No way.

2794
03:16:13,080 --> 03:16:15,080
Force triggers one random item.

2795
03:16:17,900 --> 03:16:19,060
Gourmet rules?

2796
03:16:19,240 --> 03:16:21,920
I mean, we've been getting like crazy stuff, so...

2797
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:41,980
Okay.

2798
03:16:43,880 --> 03:17:09,860
see order of operations you first stocks yeah uh gourmet park stocks another one wait what oh the gourmet oh okay we doubled that okay um okay re-roll the lobster gosh we just can't get anything else

2799
03:17:13,880 --> 03:17:14,520
Eat, eat?

2800
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:15,340
No!

2801
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:17,000
Reroll?

2802
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:19,020
Avocado?

2803
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:23,620
Uh...

2804
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:28,560
Will I be able to afford...

2805
03:17:29,320 --> 03:17:30,460
What is this?

2806
03:17:30,700 --> 03:17:31,800
Oh, the inflatable dolphin.

2807
03:17:32,920 --> 03:17:36,320
Coming in here with no context for this game has me questioning if this game is real.

2808
03:17:36,480 --> 03:17:37,400
Who is Dave?

2809
03:17:37,860 --> 03:17:38,460
Hi, Maple!

2810
03:17:42,680 --> 03:17:45,040
Kata, kata, kata, kata, kata, kata, kata, kata.

2811
03:17:47,260 --> 03:17:49,480
Oh my gosh, wait, Ducky, I missed your thing.

2812
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:51,000
I'm going to be in Japan starting next week.

2813
03:17:51,460 --> 03:17:53,340
Any food or places you'd like me to feed?

2814
03:17:53,900 --> 03:17:55,460
Take you, Minky Plush.

2815
03:17:58,620 --> 03:17:59,120
Yes!

2816
03:17:59,820 --> 03:18:00,720
Yes, I know!

2817
03:18:01,380 --> 03:18:04,000
I want you to go to Taiyo no Tomato, man.

2818
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:07,340
Taiyo, like sun, no.

2819
03:18:08,680 --> 03:18:10,740
Tomato, like tomato, men.

2820
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:12,400
It is, oh my gosh.

2821
03:18:13,580 --> 03:18:16,280
It's basically ramen, but the...

2822
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:20,580
But the base is tomato, like the soup, tomato soup.

2823
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:22,660
It's so...

2824
03:18:22,660 --> 03:18:25,060
And I've been meaning to go the past couple of times.

2825
03:18:25,820 --> 03:18:27,400
But I keep having not...

2826
03:18:27,400 --> 03:18:29,940
Like, if I pass by one, I'm not hungry.

2827
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:35,360
And if I am hungry, there's not one nearby.

2828
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:37,420
It's so...

2829
03:18:37,420 --> 03:18:38,900
And they put cheese on it.

2830
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,140
It's basically just spaghetti soup.

2831
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:42,880
They put cheese on it.

2832
03:18:42,980 --> 03:18:43,780
And oh my gosh.

2833
03:18:44,260 --> 03:18:45,540
It's so stinking good.

2834
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:49,940
Tomato men of the sun?

2835
03:18:50,560 --> 03:18:51,640
No, like noodles.

2836
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:53,240
Men is noodles.

2837
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:59,440
So, tomato men is my o susume, my recommendation.

2838
03:18:59,820 --> 03:19:00,820
Please take me there.

2839
03:19:01,140 --> 03:19:01,560
Please!

2840
03:19:01,980 --> 03:19:06,760
But put on the bib for me and for you so you don't get your clothes dirty.

2841
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:07,940
Or me dirty.

2842
03:19:09,480 --> 03:19:13,000
Because that would be so, so sad if you got tomato on me.

2843
03:19:13,980 --> 03:19:14,400
Or you.

2844
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:20,260
talking about while listening, so no idea what's happening in this game, but I like hearing happy meato noises.

2845
03:19:20,840 --> 03:19:45,100
I'm basically getting, I'm basically juggling, I'm basically juggling, and I'm getting huge Dave Potts, not Jack, no Jack, no Jack, I'm getting a Dave, Dave Potts instead.

2846
03:19:48,900 --> 03:19:50,140
We're juggling?

2847
03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:53,020
We're juggling?

2848
03:19:54,260 --> 03:19:56,040
And we're getting huge Dave Pot.

2849
03:20:00,650 --> 03:20:01,510
But what did I else?

2850
03:20:01,870 --> 03:20:05,070
Oh, let's see if I can afford it.

2851
03:20:06,930 --> 03:20:07,430
Huge.

2852
03:20:07,650 --> 03:20:07,830
Okay.

2853
03:20:08,270 --> 03:20:10,250
Our rare odds are now 10%.

2854
03:20:15,050 --> 03:20:16,790
Actual TikTok speech.

2855
03:20:16,970 --> 03:20:17,970
I feel like!

2856
03:20:19,010 --> 03:20:20,350
I feel like I have to.

2857
03:20:22,790 --> 03:20:26,370
I'm being, my channel is being unalived right now.

2858
03:20:29,410 --> 03:20:30,650
I have to.

2859
03:20:31,310 --> 03:20:32,350
Thank you for explaining.

2860
03:20:32,550 --> 03:20:32,950
You're welcome.

2861
03:20:44,520 --> 03:20:45,160
Mega explosion.

2862
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:46,460
Let's try it.

2863
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:47,900
Oh, here we go.

2864
03:20:53,900 --> 03:20:55,020
When's it gonna clear the board?

2865
03:20:57,860 --> 03:20:59,340
Wait, I thought I was supposed to clear the board.

2866
03:21:02,580 --> 03:21:02,980
Yeah.

2867
03:21:08,300 --> 03:21:10,380
It's been gone by the lally-lo-lo!

2868
03:21:12,480 --> 03:21:13,360
We're in queue!

2869
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:14,040
We're in queue!

2870
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:18,140
Oh, but the round!

2871
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:19,400
Oh my gosh, it's now at T.

2872
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:21,360
I broke the game again.

2873
03:21:21,500 --> 03:21:22,380
I broke the game again.

2874
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:24,680
Wait, we're about to go to...

2875
03:21:27,620 --> 03:21:28,020
Um...

2876
03:21:31,460 --> 03:21:33,460
We're about to go back to the black market.

2877
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:38,680
Oh my gosh, we're almost to round 100!

2878
03:21:43,060 --> 03:21:44,500
Vito acute!

2879
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:49,560
So, play.

2880
03:21:56,730 --> 03:21:57,170
Three.

2881
03:22:01,190 --> 03:22:02,030
Silence, you two.

2882
03:22:02,350 --> 03:22:03,130
Bitrate blast.

2883
03:22:06,670 --> 03:22:08,490
Oh my gosh.

2884
03:22:09,710 --> 03:22:10,050
Nice.

2885
03:22:10,810 --> 03:22:11,370
Sorry.

2886
03:22:11,710 --> 03:22:12,890
Oh, we got a little excited.

2887
03:22:16,490 --> 03:22:17,290
Rare.

2888
03:22:18,150 --> 03:22:18,730
Pants.

2889
03:22:19,270 --> 03:22:19,530
Skip.

2890
03:22:25,260 --> 03:22:26,060
Rare.

2891
03:22:27,320 --> 03:22:28,040
Pants.

2892
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:28,580
Skip.

2893
03:22:31,620 --> 03:22:32,420
Pants.

2894
03:22:32,640 --> 03:22:33,980
Get pants, nerd.

2895
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:35,060
10.

2896
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:36,060
8.

2897
03:22:36,680 --> 03:22:37,720
I'll take it.

2898
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:40,220
Ah, pants.

2899
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:45,820
I'm so unbothered now.

2900
03:22:46,000 --> 03:23:00,040
Like, I'm just kind of like going the motion i feel like i've i've i've i've totally destroyed the game so much that it's it's like

2901
03:23:06,960 --> 03:23:14,100
insanity at this point you give you the real super secret ending by gaining so much score the game actually can crash wait really

2902
03:23:17,240 --> 03:23:20,780
I don't think I can lose because we're like actually scaling, you know?

2903
03:23:22,900 --> 03:23:24,960
So I don't know if we can lose.

2904
03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:31,960
Surprised you're still aiming?

2905
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:41,340
Well, it's like I said, I, you know, I'm trying to aim for like the lower one so that I can get even bigger number.

2906
03:23:44,220 --> 03:23:46,120
But we have two left until 100.

2907
03:23:48,520 --> 03:23:50,120
This game can full on break.

2908
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:50,800
Break break?

2909
03:23:54,480 --> 03:23:55,060
What if?

2910
03:23:55,720 --> 03:23:56,340
What if?

2911
03:23:57,460 --> 03:23:57,880
Reroll.

2912
03:23:59,840 --> 03:24:00,600
What is this?

2913
03:24:00,680 --> 03:24:01,480
Toy fish!

2914
03:24:01,840 --> 03:24:04,680
Two random pegs will copy the number of the first peg popped.

2915
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:08,200
If this item is in slot 7, four pegs will be affected instead of two.

2916
03:24:09,120 --> 03:24:09,540
Oh.

2917
03:24:10,820 --> 03:24:13,540
You can crash it pretty easily with a crazy boot.

2918
03:24:14,020 --> 03:24:15,300
Sorry for the bitrate, everybody.

2919
03:24:19,380 --> 03:24:19,920
Okay.

2920
03:24:20,960 --> 03:24:22,320
Oh, not end game.

2921
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:23,680
No, we're done.

2922
03:24:24,040 --> 03:24:25,700
Sorry, I almost clicked the wrong button.

2923
03:24:28,040 --> 03:24:29,060
That would have been so tragic.

2924
03:24:31,380 --> 03:24:32,620
This video has inspired me.

2925
03:24:32,740 --> 03:24:35,980
I'm going to remove all my home insulation and replace it with asbestos.

2926
03:24:36,340 --> 03:24:38,040
You can't lose, baby!

2927
03:24:40,400 --> 03:24:41,360
Asbestos party.

2928
03:24:43,220 --> 03:24:44,140
Boss round!

2929
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:45,700

How festive!

2931
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:50,120
When popped, all pegs will copy this pegs as the...

2932
03:24:50,140 --> 03:24:51,020
number.

2933
03:24:52,340 --> 03:24:53,240
Holiday cheer.

2934
03:24:55,060 --> 03:24:57,820
Holiday cheer.

2935
03:24:58,720 --> 03:24:59,760
Holiday cheer.

2936
03:25:02,620 --> 03:25:04,540
It's time.

2937
03:25:06,220 --> 03:25:09,060
I don't want a lot for Christmas.

2938
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,720
There's just the thing I need.

2939
03:25:15,620 --> 03:25:16,480
What's the gun do?

2940
03:25:16,600 --> 03:25:17,180
Buckshot.

2941
03:25:18,280 --> 03:25:24,460
Wait, can I not play Buckshot anymore either and

2942
03:25:32,160 --> 03:25:38,800
I what first

2943
03:25:43,340 --> 03:25:53,160
if this if the first peg popped was the highest number peg force triggers the item in slots one and two two times each guys

2944
03:25:56,640 --> 03:26:11,350

This is so fun.

2947
03:26:19,350 --> 03:26:20,170
