00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,120
Go!

2
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Go!

3
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,820
Go!

4
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Go!

5
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Go!

6
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Go!

7
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Go!

8
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,720
Go!

9
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Go!

10
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
What, what, what, what!

11
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,500
First,

12
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:56,030
we will start with an introduction how about I start uh, hello, I have spontaneously thrown this group together because it's people that I love and I think they should make love.

13
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,310
Make love?

14
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,330
Yeah!

15
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,110
Make love!

16
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,650
I know you will!

17
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,670
I know you will!

18
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,410
I believe in you, Ollie!

19
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,850
I didn't know that was...this kind of collab!

20
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,970
It's always that kind of collab!

21
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,390
Yeah!

22
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,350
Okay.

23
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,650
So, uh, yeah.

24
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,150
I'll throw it over to, um, my colleague, uh, Ollie.

25
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,230
Oh.

26
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,290
Hello everyone!

27
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,110
I'm from Yaluah from Haha from the 82nd Generation!

28
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,890
All right!

29
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,090
Today I'm collabing with my OshiiSei, my Oshii's partner... and my Oshii's daughter..

30
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,550
Yeah!

31
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,470
Yeah?

32
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,530
Wait, wait, wait.

33
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,110
Wait.

34
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,830
Can you...

35
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,830
Wait.

36
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,650
I'm... I'm your Oshiii slash Aeï¿½?

37
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,410
Do you only realize?!

38
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,350
I mean...I mean, you kind of said that before...

39
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,170
I was like...

40
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,850
It still surprises me.

41
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,590
Yippee!

42
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,530
I love you!

43
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,290
I love you too!

44
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,670
Sweet.

45
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,790
Okay, then to my daughter.

46
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,030
She's not streaming, guys.

47
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,470
No POV from my daughter, but...

48
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,230
It's gonna be...

49
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,270
It's gonna be really good at gaming today, I think, right?

50
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,990
Pokobo?

51
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,350
Yeah, I'm... I'm...

52
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,010
I'm...

53
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,730
Uh...

54
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,930
Yeah...

55
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,730
I'm good.

56
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,730
Quite good.

57
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,410
I'm...

58
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,610
I think I'm...

59
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,730
I will play better than...

60
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,490
This...

61
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,010
Person that's streaming, because...

62
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,010
Oh!

63
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,750
I don't...

64
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,370
I don't...

65
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,410
I'm...

66
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,410
Hi, Minto!

67
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,690
Hi, Kovo!

68
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,170
This is my first time playing with Minto.

69
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,010
I...

70
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,370
Uh...

71
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,630
Yeah!

72
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,510
Yeah...

73
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,410
Yeah...

74
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,790
I am...

75
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,710
I am Takenashi, Kiara's daughter.

76
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:55,890
Yeah!

77
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,990
I heard!

78
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,330
Yeah!

79
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,110
Congrats on the baby!

80
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,350
Yeah!

81
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,110
No, thank you.

82
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,130
She's already...

83
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,590
Quite old at this point.

84
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,410
But, um...

85
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,310
What do you mean?

86
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,230
Old Mawa!

87
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,010
Who's old?

88
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,050
You...

89
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,910
You...

90
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,310
You've grown out of the diapers.

91
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,790
Anyways...

92
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,670
What?

93
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,510
She didn't deny it.

94
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,730
That's...

95
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,190
That's me, everyone!

96
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,650
Close the floor!

97
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,350
Yeah!

98
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,690
Yeah!

99
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,180
Book of...

100
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,260
Last but not least, the outsider.

101
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,860
The one that we will pick on and bully...

102
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,460
Totally.

103
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,860
But, the one who fits in here the best because she's a ghost.

104
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't know.

105
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,200
Wait a sec.

106
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,780
But...

107
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,280
I think Ollie also fits.

108
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,680
No?

109
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,180
Oh!

110
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,600
True!

111
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:52,800
True!

112
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:52,960
True!

113
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:53,740
Yeah!

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Yeah!

115
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,800
You two should...

116
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,340
You two should make a baby.

117
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,080
Therefore.

118
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,280
Oh my god!

119
00:08:59,540 --> 00:08:59,900
Make!

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,700
Yeah!

122
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,820
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,860
Don't be sorry.

124
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,940
Don't be sorry!

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
I think...

126
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,680
I think...

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,160
I think that's the collab.

128
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,220
You'd make love with me, Mint?

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,380
Of...

130
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,100
Of course.

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Ollie.

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,140
I mean...

133
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm a little shy, but...

134
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,920
I should introduce myself.

135
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,420
Maybe.

136
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,880
Hello, everybody!

137
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,720
Okaerina Saimase!

138
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,520
Goshiji-sama!

139
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,340
My name is Mint Phantom.

140
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm a ghost-made VTuber.

141
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,940
I...

142
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:39,880
Somehow...

143
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,580
Have infiltrated this...

144
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,760
Collab.

145
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,940
But I'm happy to be here!

146
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,800
Yeah!

147
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,280
Yeah!

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,100
I...

149
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,060
I don't even know who Mint Phantom is.

150
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,420
I invited Meido Minto.

151
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
Who is Mint Phantom?

152
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,080
Excuse me?

153
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Uh...

154
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,740
Wrong place, maybe?

155
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,280
Yeah.

156
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,200
She's like...

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
The...

158
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Not as cool sister.

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,920
Uh...

160
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
I still...

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,340
Okay.

162
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,340
Uh...

163
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,560
I guess you'll be fine.

164
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,020
You'll...

165
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,500
You'll do.

166
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,620
I don't know how to play this game...

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,580
By the way.

168
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,520
I know, but I like...

169
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,900
Don't know.

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,060
I think we have...

171
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,100
People who can carry us.

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,940
Kobo apparently is like...

173
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,500
Really good?

174
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Apparently.

176
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah?

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,140
And Oli, I assume you too.

178
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,560
Because I feel like I saw ID grinding this game a lot.

179
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,420
Oh, I'm uh...

180
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,980
I'm just um...

181
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm an Eren girl.

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,860
She does the heavy lift off.

183
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,760
Okay!

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,780
I'm excited!

185
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,780
I love being carried.

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Like last time...

187
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,100
Last week I collabed with Weyna...

188
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,580
And she was carrying us so hard too in Rebo.

189
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,740
Oh yeah!

190
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,500
Oh yeah!

191
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,700
She's a beast in it.

193
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,740
Okay, I can't...

194
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm gonna be princess carried.

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,320
Hehehehe.

196
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,820
Hehehehe.

197
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,160
Hehehehe.

198
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,800
Hehehehe.

199
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,980
Should we start?

200
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,460
Oh yeah, yeah.

201
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,900
Should we start?

202
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,020
Yoroshku!

203
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,200
Yoroshku!

204
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,740
Yoroshku!

205
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,540
Yoroshku!

206
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,640
Yoroshku!

207
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,180
Alright, let's go.

208
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,000
Alright, one thing.

209
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,240
Two hours into the stream...

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,180
Or like...

211
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,640
Okay...

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,100
40 minutes in one hour from now...

213
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,420
And we will all watch...

214
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,260
A song premiere...

215
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,620
On Reina's channel...

216
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,680
Because I am part of it.

217
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,320
Sorry guys.

218
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:14,980
Sorry.

219
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,740
Yes!

220
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,680
Don't apologize!

221
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,860
Okay!

222
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,100
Let's begin!

223
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,260
Let's begin!

224
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,820
Are you...

225
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay, hold on.

226
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,780
I'm figuring...

227
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,480
Okay...

228
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
How do you get roosed?

229
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,140
What are you doing?

230
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,940
Come over here!

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm running...

232
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,660
I'm trying to...

233
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

234
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:34,980
Yeah?

235
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,120
Wait, how do you get really small?

236
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,040
Uh...

237
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Control.

238
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,020
Control?

239
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,900
Control?

240
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,440
That's it?

241
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,820
Yeah!

242
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,940
Yeah, you're small now.

243
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,760
You look cute when you're small like that.

244
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,380
That's very accurate to...

245
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,960
Your...

246
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,380
Actual height though.

247
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,960
Stay like that, maybe?

248
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,340
I don't wanna play this game anymore.

249
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,360
I...

250
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,200
I feel like this guy right here.

251
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,940
It's okay.

252
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,040
You don't have to be ashamed.

253
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,360
It's uh...

254
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,060
You're not the only one.

255
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Boko Boy is also around that height.

256
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,260
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,160
Okay, hold on.

258
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,220
Uh...

259
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,560
Do not click the duck.

260
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,420
Yeah.

261
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
She likes you this time.

262
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,600
Last time she loved me.

263
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,500
Now she loves you.

264
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,200
My child has a child.

265
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,760
I love you.

266
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yeah, now I'm really small.

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Okay, okay.

268
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,940
That's like the tiny...

269
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,900
I love you!

270
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,840
Oh!

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh!

272
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,340
Oh!

273
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,780
Oh!

274
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,860
Oh!

275
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,480
What just happened?

276
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,480
What is that?

277
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,100
What is that?

278
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,100
What is that?

279
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,920
What is that?

280
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,660
What is that?

281
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,000
What is that?

282
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,360
Cute, too small.

283
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,280
Um...

284
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,720
What is that thing?

285
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,510
We're fine.

286
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,530
Maybe?

287
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,270
Guys, I'm so out of my element.

288
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,270
My computer is... the brightness is not bright enough.

289
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,350
I'm struggling.

290
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,830
It's a laser clown.

291
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,350
Oh!

292
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,510
Oh!

293
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,990
Huh!

294
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,310
Okay, you're still alive!

295
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,290
You guys are alive!

296
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,710
I don't know, maybe not for long.

297
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,430
E!

298
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,890
Okay, I'm following you.

299
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,670
Okay, yeah, okay, so let's...

300
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,870
Oh, oh!

301
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,470
Oh!

302
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:54,910
Oh!

303
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,250
Welcome to the road...

304
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,670
Take me home...

305
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,010
To the place...

306
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,670
I belong...

307
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,670
West Virginia...

308
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,250
Come on, your Discord is muted.

309
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,830
It's not 0%.

310
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,340
So, why?

311
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
Oh, the floor!

312
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,540
Oh!

313
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,140
Oh, the...

314
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,640
Oh...

315
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,220
The foogie!

316
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,300
All of them were dead.

317
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,620
All of them were dead.

318
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:30,860
All of them were dead.

319
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,660
Brawl!

320
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,460
Brawl!

321
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
You can do it!

322
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,480
Keep on mind!

323
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,740
Nah...

324
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah!

325
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,100
What ain't happening?

326
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,920
Uh...

327
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,480
Oh, uh...

328
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
Should I raise...

329
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
Wait, okay, I'll raise the game audio.

330
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,140
You guys wanted that last time too.

331
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,460
You got this.

332
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm not gonna...

333
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,280
We can just...

334
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,980
All right.

335
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,380
Just go!

337
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,640
Yeah, this is a warm-up.

338
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,480
It's a warm-up.

339
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,900
We're all dead.

340
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
Come on, get out of there.

341
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,820
Oh no, your head's stuck.

342
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,760
She's stuck.

343
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,200
I got a big ol' head.

344
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,660
I got a big ol' head.

345
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,260
Honestly, we should restart.

346
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,820
Cause like...

347
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,300
Hey!

348
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.

349
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,600
Should we...

350
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,640
Ghost!

351
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,060
Revive!

352
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,960
Revive!

353
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,300
Revive!

354
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,480
Revive me!

355
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,680
Revive me, Jet!

356
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,180
Revive me!

357
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,220
I can't do you.

358
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,960
I don't know.

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,460
Come out.

360
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
This will be super boring for them.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,860
I think he's gone.

362
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,860
I think he's gone.

363
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah, maybe he's gone.

364
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,840
She should...

365
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,180
I'm not as good as they are.

366
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,520
Like, I can sneak my way through places quite easily, doll.

367
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,040
I think I...

368
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,760
I found a potion.

369
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,980
Potions?

370
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,120
Plus, you found that a potion!

371
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,200
Easy?

372
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,840
What?

373
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Make smiley's potion?

374
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,740
English?

375
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,600
Please?

376
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,900
I'm not gonna come back...

377
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Oh, is it because...

378
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,560
Everybody's dead?

379
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,740
So it's like...

380
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,420
Self-sess now?

381
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,340
But I can sneak past enemies...

382
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,240
Oh, it's all about the potion!

383
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,760
It seems like I'm in love with the potion!

384
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,500
Cause everyone else is dead.

385
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
That's pretty good already!

386
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm right there, my man!

387
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm right there!

388
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,220
Let's get one more thing, Kiara.

389
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,800
One more thing.

390
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah!

391
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,180
On the...

392
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,300
Normal version.

393
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,040
Which is nice.

394
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,400
Is there anything else in this room?

395
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,700
This is a pretty nice room.

396
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,580
So, uh...

397
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,820
You guys come around here often?

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,920
I haven't seen the enemies in a while.

399
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,460
Um...

400
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,760
School?

401
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,580
Uh...

402
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,380
I've been dead for a long time.

403
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

404
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,580
Oh, yeah, I know.

405
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,020
Me too.

406
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,340
I've been here for a while because I'm...

407
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,580
I die first.

408
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,060
No?

409
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,620
Oh, right.

410
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,200
Maybe we're good.

411
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,540
Right.

412
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,420
One thousand.

413
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,300
We need you, Kobo.

414
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,740
You're the...

415
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,680
You're the pro here.

416
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Monkey?

417
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:58,860
Yeah!

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,080
Why did you die first?

419
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
I didn't hear anything.

420
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,940
I didn't hear my back.

421
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,840
Like...

422
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,500
She distract me.

423
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,520
I was carrying my love potion.

424
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,040
And Mommy Kiwawa...

425
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,800
Watching me.

426
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,220
Okay.

427
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,760
I knew...

428
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:14,940
I knew...

429
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,840
She got infected.

430
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,380
It's her fault.

431
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,180
It's her fault.

432
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,020
Yeah, we can say that.

433
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,860
We can say that.

434
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,700
We can say that.

435
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,520
Oh, yeah.

436
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,540
Yeah.

437
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,680
Cheap, but...

438
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, wait.

439
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,240
I think there's a necklace there.

440
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,200
Yarr!

441
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,520
Look that I have the...

442
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,160
Collection point right here.

443
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,600
And things are mostly still...

444
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,560
Yeah!

445
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,680
She's halfway there.

446
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Being left alone.

447
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,460
Maybe it knows that I'm alone now.

448
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,300
Is this...

449
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,800
Oh, yeah.

450
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
She got it.

451
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,980
She got it.

452
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,560
Oh, it's only 600.

453
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,180
Yeah, the ring.

454
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,740
Okay.

455
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,440
Okay, we're cashing in.

456
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,620
500!

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,400
So far so good.

458
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
Nice and slow, Kiwawa.

459
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,140
Nice and slow.

460
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,940
5100?

461
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,940
I can do a few rounds, my ghost!

462
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,860
She's doing so well without us.

463
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm on my own.

464
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,280
This is the way I prove myself.

465
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,040
And then the rest of all the other rounds, I will just not do anything.

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

467
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,280
I mean, I guess that's fear.

468
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm gonna kill myself after, right?

469
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,240
Oh, no, the vase!

470
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,740
Oh, that's going to help so much.

471
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,560
Oh, no, but it's so heavy!

472
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,020
Oh, can't.

473
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,300
Ow!

474
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,960
No, but it would've been too good to be cheating.

475
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,820
I knew it.

476
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,600
That's a hard...

477
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,260
I knew it.

478
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,640
That's a hard place to reach.

479
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,040
That's a hard place to reach, yeah.

480
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,120
I don't know how you get that down there.

481
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,020
Maybe I would need a longer reach so I can get it without jumping up there.

482
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,680
You guys, I don't know if we're reviving.

483
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Yeah, I don't know.

484
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,580
We might as well just start over.

485
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay, I'm done with this room.

486
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Kiara just wanted an audience.

487
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
Kind of scared to go into other rooms.

488
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,200
Us watching her play.

489
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,180
Yeah, this isn't the gaming class, guys.

490
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,260
It's a watch-along.

491
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,260
Oh, careful.

492
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:08,900
Careful.

493
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,060
Yeah, good job.

494
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,400
She got a cup.

495
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,120
Good job.

496
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,400
Good job.

497
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,580
Good job.

498
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,060
What the long...

499
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah!

500
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,920
Almost?

501
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,600
Let's go!

502
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,200
Just a little bit.

503
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,120
Okay, I'm scared.

504
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,700
Surely the monster's gone.

505
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
It's been real quiet.

506
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,640
Is there something left there?

507
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,140
That's good?

508
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah.

509
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,740
Yes!

510
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,460
Yes!

511
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,220
One, two.

512
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,860
Really

513
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,700
close.

514
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,760
That was so close.

515
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,840
Where did it come from?

516
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,260
She didn't get any damage.

517
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,540
She didn't get any damage.

518
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,400
Where did it come from?

519
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,680
I know!

520
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
I thought the rats are already hitting her.

521
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,720
I didn't hit her at all.

522
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,940
She didn't get any damage.

523
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,960
That's weird.

524
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,350
Oh, poor sweet summer child.

525
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,030
She can make it.

526
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,430
Oh no, you can hear their roars.

527
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,290
It feels so bad.

528
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,310
Her character looks traumatized.

529
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,130
Not real.

530
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,420
Do you see Kiara like this often?

531
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,160
Not really.

532
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,340
It's kind of a...

533
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,980
It's an interesting look for her.

534
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,300
She's always so confident.

535
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,800
No.

536
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,220
And now she's...

537
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,720
Traumatized.

538
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,560
There's a thousand yard stare.

539
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,160
I think she should just grab...

540
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,900
Not the cart.

541
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,540
And run.

542
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,960
Yeah.

543
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
Grab the item in the...

544
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,700
In it.

545
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,160
And run.

546
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,880
The duckies, you can't touch them, right?

547
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,480
No.

548
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,600
If you hurt them, then they will turn into a monster.

549
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,580
Oh.

551
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, don't...

552
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,500
Oh, don't squeeze the duck.

553
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:28,900
Oh.

554
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,040
Okay, okay.

555
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Okay, okay, okay.

556
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,600
That's...

557
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,140
Tell the duck.

558
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,100
Tell the duck, yeah.

559
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,420
Get that sucker in there.

560
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,420
Shallow his guts.

561
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,460
Oh, nice!

562
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,300
Yes, you did it!

563
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,320
Damn!

564
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,880
Good!

565
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,600
Are

566
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,610
we...

567
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,120
You did it!

568
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,880
You did it!

569
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,500
You did it yourself, mom!

570
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm so proud of you.

571
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,160
Thank you!

572
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Glad you could live!

573
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,940
I'm sorry, it must have been really good.

574
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,520
You thief.

575
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,440
I see the gold!

576
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,220
He was right there.

577
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,620
The money?

578
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,940
What?

579
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,620
The money?

580
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,560
The money?

581
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,460
Yeah, we don't have much money, but...

582
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:26,960
The money?

583
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,500
The money?

584
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,620
What the...

585
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,820
What money?

586
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,980
Oh.

587
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,700
No, nothing.

588
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,960
Are you guys gonna be cooked now with low HP?

589
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,960
Umm...

590
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,280
No...

591
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,180
Cause we can't heal you much.

592
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,500
Wait!

593
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,140
How much HP does everybody have now?

594
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,580
I have 50!

595
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,500
51!

596
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,080
Okay?

597
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,440
Okay...

598
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,540
Okay...

599
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,940
Go give yourself some...

600
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,840
Health...

601
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Healing...

602
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,160
Back...

603
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,980
So good...

604
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,300
I wanna be stronger...

605
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,260
Stronger...

606
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,140
Oh, you can take this...

607
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,280
Stronger?

608
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,520
Mmm...

609
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,120
Okay...

610
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,760
Then you can pick up the vase, like you couldn't before...

611
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,420
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

612
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,960
You've watched me, huh?

613
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,740
Oh...

614
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,040
Nothing else to watch...

615
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,900
We all watched you...

616
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,300
All eyes on me!

617
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah!

618
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:19,980
Yeah!

619
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah!

620
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,660
Um...

621
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,840
Wait, so...

622
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:24,980
Oh, look!

623
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,480
Over here!

624
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,780
Hey, hey!

625
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,860
We can go up!

626
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,480
We can go...

627
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,780
You can?

628
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,360
Yeah!

629
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,380
Every time...

630
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,820
Oh, yeah!

631
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,260
You can!

632
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,480
Every time!

633
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,860
Every time!

634
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,780
What's in here?

635
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,120
It's...

636
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
We could find some free stuffs, I think.

637
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,840
Really?

638
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Wait!

639
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,360
Wait!

640
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
How do you become like super tiny again?

641
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,820
Like Q!

642
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,180
Q!

643
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,680
You wouldn't hear...

644
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,660
Them...

645
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:52,940
E!

646
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,060
Go Q!

647
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll...

648
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,180
I'll...

649
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,760
Okay...

650
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm Q!

651
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
Throw me!

652
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,100
Throw me!

653
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,820
Okay!

654
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:01,660
Oh!

655
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,440
Whoa!

656
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,780
For my biceps!

657
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,120
If that will lead us to success because you're stronger...

658
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,020
Then I think it's totally legit!

659
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,100
Yes!

660
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,840
Do we need you?

661
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,160
Yes!

662
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,220
I don't know!

663
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,980
It's scary!

664
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:16,820
Wait!

665
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,280
Why is it so freaky up here?

666
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,360
You see...

667
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,660
Oh!

668
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,320
There's a grenade!

669
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,960
Will that explode?

670
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,240
Uh...

671
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,980
A boynock?

672
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,400
Uh...

673
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,180
I lowered them a bit, so overall...

674
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,140
There's more grenades!

675
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,460
Why is it so scary up here?

676
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
Is that a skilly?

677
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,000
But honestly, even I barely hear them.

678
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,140
Yeah...

679
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,140
What is E?

680
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,180
Why is it so spooky?

681
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,460
Eeeee!

682
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,320
I don't know...

683
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,380
I don't know...

684
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,720
I don't know...

685
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,720
I don't think there's anything else up here...

686
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,450
It's a ghost...

687
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:06,920
Me?

688
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,080
Me?

689
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,800
Crouch the whole time, I'm scared...

690
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,260
I'm dead!

691
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,640
Oh, there he is!

692
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,380
That's his legs!

693
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,540
I wish I could turn on my flashlight...

694
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,060
Why can't people up there?

695
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,480
Why can't people up there?

696
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,460
Why can't people up there?

697
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,760
Why can't people up there?

698
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
I'd like to see that!

699
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,340
I'm gonna lean back now...

700
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,000
And chill...

701
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,920
And let you do it!

702
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,700
We got this!

703
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I'll help too...

704
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,360
Watch this!

705
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,660
I'm gonna do a backflip!

706
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,740
That will totally help!

707
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,180
It will impress the enemies!

708
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,960
Yeah, yeah!

709
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,160
They'll never see it coming!

710
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,240
Wait, use five, six, seven...

711
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,700
Wait, wait, wait!

712
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:06,960
Wait, wait, wait!

713
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,680
Can...

714
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,800
Can Mint and Kobo stand next to each other for a moment?

715
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,240
And then, Kobo, can you press Q?

716
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,100
Or no, actually...

717
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,840
Actually...

718
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,040
Mint, press Q.

719
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,080
Kobo, press...

720
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,880
Uh...

721
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,000
This...

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,740
Uh...

723
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,340
CTRL...

724
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,020
Control...

725
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,420
So, this is accurate height...

726
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,320
Nasty!

727
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,860
That's nasty of you!

728
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,740
Kobo...

729
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,200
Kobo, how tall are you?

730
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,200
One hundred...

731
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,100
Fifty-one!

732
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,440
Oh, you lost what you said!

733
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,600
He's tiny as fuck!

734
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,920
This is unfair!

735
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,180
Yeah!

736
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,600
Tiny!

737
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,720
Wait, I can just throw her around!

738
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,800
That's how tiny she is!

739
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,300
What...

740
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,940
Why am I...

741
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,380
Why...

742
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,460
Why did you invite me here to...

743
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,740
To kill me again?

744
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,140
I'm already dead!

745
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
What else do you want from me?

746
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,280
Who...

747
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,980
Who wants the stamina?

748
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
What about the stamina?

749
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

750
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,820
Anyone can have it.

751
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,000
You probably...

752
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,620
I believe in the ID girls.

753
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,540
You two should have the ID.

754
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,180
Yeah, I agree, I agree, I agree.

755
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,860
Really?

756
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,460
Okay, thank you!

757
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,700
Let's go!

758
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
Let's go!

759
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,120
Let's go!

760
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,460
Let's go!

761
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:32,940
Let's go!

762
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,160
Let's go!

763
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
I won't die.

764
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,940
Immediately.

765
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,260
I hope so, otherwise you're fired!

766
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,760
Oh no!

767
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,660
You can't fire me!

768
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,380
I quit!

769
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,460
Girls!

770
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,300
I did it!

771
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,980
You...

772
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,740
Pronounce the name of this place, please.

773
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
It's um...

774
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,300
Um...

775
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't know...

776
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,100
I don't know...

777
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,300
I think...

778
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,640
Abandoned...

779
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,520
When it was...

780
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
Saying...

781
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,660
McJanic.

782
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,680
McJanic.

783
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,320
McJanic.

784
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,700
What?

785
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,980
There's a name here?

786
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,560
Yeah, this place is called...

787
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,980
McJanic.

788
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,420
I don't know what name actually you refer.

789
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,160
Nice.

790
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,620
It's like when children are jealous.

791
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,600
No, wait.

792
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,360
Parents get jealous of the children.

793
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,720
Wait, who gets jealous?

794
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,960
Who's getting...

795
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,100
Everybody gets jealous.

796
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,340
Everybody's getting jealous.

797
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,180
Everybody's getting jealous.

798
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,420
The baby strobe.

799
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,460
What?

800
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,560
I found something!

801
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,400
You can bring this...

802
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,120
Cobelman.

803
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,780
Oh!

804
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,140
I will bring it carefully.

805
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,460
Yeah!

806
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,520
It's your color!

807
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,640
Oh!

808
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,680
Woof!

809
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:17,940
Woof!

810
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,280
Woof!

811
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,520
Woof!

812
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,320
Okay.

813
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,020
Careful.

814
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,380
Be careful not to break it.

815
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:21,900
Easy.

816
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,240
Easy.

817
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,680
It's my color.

818
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,480
I've got my very own cup.

819
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm gonna show my stuff with my little cup.

820
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,000
Her voice has finally matured.

821
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,200
Who?

822
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,380
My...

823
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,480
My baby's voice.

824
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,120
She's...

825
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,790
Who's alive?

826
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,150
Who's alive?

827
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,310
Who's alive?

828
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,350
I'm alive.

829
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,510
I'm here.

830
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,190
Why does he keep dying first?

831
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,210
What a baby.

832
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,630
I can't work like this, man.

833
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,470
She had literally just grown up and had a mature voice.

834
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,150
And now...

835
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,810
Now she's dead.

836
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,790
My thoughts...

837
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,250
Can't.

838
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,770
What do you do against that thing?

839
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,570
You just hide?

840
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,870
I've never seen it before.

841
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,610
I think you should look...

842
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,310
Uh...

843
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,670
Wait.

844
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,950
What do you do?

845
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,750
I broke my cup.

846
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,090
I broke my cup.

847
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,490
Oli, I broke my cup.

848
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:34,970
You did?

849
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,170
No, no it's not.

850
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,850
It's right there.

851
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:37,710
Oh.

852
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,550
Oh.

853
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,050
Just...

854
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,410
I

855
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,830
got the tube.

856
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,530
What the hell?

857
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,390
Oli's gonna carry us now.

858
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,350
Let's go big.

859
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,350
We won't get out.

860
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,930
What is this thing?

861
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,920
Good luck stoloing.

862
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,400
Let's go.

863
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
We're doing so well.

864
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,020
Kobo, do you know how do we normally behave around that thing?

865
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,800
All three of them are dead, aren't they?

866
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,220
The sperm?

867
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,000
No, it's the sperm.

868
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,700
The...

869
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,280
The...

870
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,760
The...

871
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:17,780
The...

872
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,180
The dead thing.

873
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,620
I don't know.

874
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,500
The...

875
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,980
The black figure.

876
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,080
The tall.

877
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,360
Yeah, the grim reaper.

878
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,540
The...

879
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,180
The old.

880
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,200
It's...

881
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,960
Just run.

882
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,660
Just run.

883
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,260
And you...

884
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,480
If you have enough...

885
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,080
Enough power, you can just...

886
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,520
You can just...

887
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,560
Punch it.

888
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,760
Okay.

889
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,200
I have fists.

890
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,360
If you have enough power...

891
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,340
I mean strength.

892
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,060
Oh...

893
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,040
4200?

894
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,300
That's a good spot.

895
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,580
Yeah.

896
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,640
So now, I have to carry...

897
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,160
You know what?

898
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,760
Go, Ollie.

899
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,880
Go, Ollie.

900
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,820
Go, Ollie.

901
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,480
I heard something.

902
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,500
Ooh, champagne.

903
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,580
Oh, that's...

904
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,060
That's...

905
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,540
Big money.

906
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,140
Big money.

907
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,700
Oh, champagne.

908
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,680
Oh, you swim watch along.

909
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah.

910
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,680
Or the girls.

911
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,860
Everybody...

912
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,300
Hey, girls.

913
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,780
Next time, everybody will watch Kobo, and then everybody will watch Minden.

914
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,740
How about that?

915
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,420
Oh, yeah.

916
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,600
I'll totally make it.

917
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,040
I'll become the final girl.

918
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,360
You won't go another way.

919
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,380
It'll happen.

920
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,860
It'll happen.

921
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:25,620
It'll happen.

922
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,900
This one's...

923
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,780
I feel like it sneaks up on you.

924
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,680
I didn't even see it behind me.

925
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,040
You found something.

926
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,420
Yeah, I watched it sneaking up on you.

927
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,900
You said nothing.

928
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,920
You have to be more aware of your surroundings.

929
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,360
You said nothing!

930
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,760
I didn't wanna...

931
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,240
I didn't wanna...

932
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,300
I didn't wanna...

933
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,660
I didn't wanna...

934
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:41,880
I didn't wanna...

935
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,780
I don't have that much of the stamina.

936
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,400
Well, you are dead.

937
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,140
How do you feel now?

938
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,800
Uh...

939
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,120
Uh...

940
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,520
Uh...

941
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:50,980
Chilling.

942
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,480
I think it's...

943
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,740
Chilling.

944
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:51,880
Chilling.

945
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,580
Being chilling.

946
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,880
Uh-huh.

947
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,260
Yep.

948
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,220
Being chilling.

949
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,540
Maybe it's faster if I just bring all the stuff in.

950
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,120
Did you guys see a little chef?

951
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,120
A tiny chef?

952
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,320
Chef?

953
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:03,960
What?

954
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,760
Not...

955
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,720
Who's not bloke?

956
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,160
Did you see tiny chef?

957
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,720
Ble...

958
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,600
Ble...

959
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,280
What are you talking about?

960
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,980
Huh?

961
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,220
What?

962
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,000
Ble...

963
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:18,760
Ble...

964
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:19,840
Ble...

965
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:19,860
Ble...

966
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,580
Ble...

967
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,180
Ble...

968
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,300
Ble...

969
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,360
Ble...

970
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,840
What?

971
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,660
Why are you having a seizure?

972
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
What is happening...

973
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,260
Are you, uh, talkin' about a game?

974
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:32,960
Or what?

975
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:33,880
No!

976
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,680
A Nickelodeon show.

977
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,440
I know Spongebob.

978
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Spongebob, yeah.

979
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,000
Why is she sideways?

980
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,960
What happened to her?

981
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,460
She saw something, trust her.

982
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,180
Why do I keep cuing myself?

983
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,920
That's so weird.

984
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,640
My chat understands what you're saying, but no one is explaining.

985
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm surprised because normally I don't know any of the memes that the brain brought.

986
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,660
Two dollars short?

987
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,080
Oh shit, two dollars, not two dollars, actually.

988
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,640
Yeah.

989
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,080
It's more than two dollars short, what is she talking about?

990
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,580
She's dead, she can't do math.

991
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,080
Understandable.

992
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,920
The milk cup.

993
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,700
What was that sound?

994
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,780
Which sound?

995
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,960
I didn't hear anything.

996
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,120
Uh oh, is there...

997
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,600
Stomach?

998
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,720
Me?

999
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,480
No, I ate.

1000
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,080
A ring!

1001
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,740
A ring!

1002
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,220
Okay, I wish I could have gotten the mint cup.

1003
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,460
Chew, you still need more, Ollie.

1004
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,820
You still need more.

1005
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,780
Don't worry guys, you guys are coming back in a GIF.

1006
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,320
I'm going to be...

1007
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,120
She will be...

1008
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,100
...twenty...

1009
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,900
...twenty...

1010
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,280
...twenty...

1011
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,860
...twenty...

1012
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,760
...twenty more dollars?

1013
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,180
No monsters.

1014
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,980
No nothing.

1015
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm carrying, oh boy you suck.

1016
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,340
What?

1017
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,620
Yo, yo, shit!

1018
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,140
Why I don't go...

1019
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,760
Yo, shit!

1020
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,860
See?

1021
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,420
I'm so short of...

1022
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,760
That's what you got, Ollie, yo, shit!

1023
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,600
Little shit!

1024
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,500
Yeah, fight!

1025
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,060
Fight!

1026
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,420
Fight!

1027
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:15,940
Fight!

1028
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Fight!

1029
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:16,940
Fight!

1030
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,520
Fight!

1031
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,040
Fight!

1032
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,920
Fight!

1033
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,460
A cup!

1034
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm gonna get...

1035
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,540
A cup!

1036
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,840
I'm gonna get a popcorn!

1037
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,220
I'm gonna get a popcorn!

1038
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,020
I'm gonna get a diamond!

1039
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,680
Ah!

1040
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,540
Ha ha!

1041
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,920
Ha ha!

1042
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,280
Ha ha!

1043
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,020
It's okay, it's okay.

1044
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,800
We just need that.

1045
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,100
I mean, Kobo still dies first anyway, so she's...

1046
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,440
...worse than me.

1047
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,340
This...

1048
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,100
...ID on ID slander...

1049
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,340
Oh!

1050
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,820
Uh oh.

1051
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,560
Uh oh.

1052
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,080
Uh oh.

1053
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,180
But it's just the vomit mask.

1054
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,020
No.

1055
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,420
It's not a biggie.

1056
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,000
No!

1057
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,560
A!

1058
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,580
I thought I was playing with pros here.

1059
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,460
What's happening?

1060
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,680
Not me.

1061
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,740
Wait, what's wrong with your face?

1062
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,440
What's wrong with your face?

1063
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,260
Something wrong with you.

1064
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,460
Something wrong with you.

1065
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,260
Please don't.

1066
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,240
I can't open my eyes.

1067
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,300
Oopsie.

1068
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,260
I always say that.

1069
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,280
Three

1070
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,450
times every time I'm near my mom.

1071
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,950
No, that has nothing to do with it.

1072
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,770
Oh, this is where you fight.

1073
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,630
This is the fight.

1074
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,330
I knew it.

1075
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,270
Let's kick out Minto first.

1076
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,430
No, wait, why VA?

1077
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,090
Why not Kobo first?

1078
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,050
She keeps dying.

1079
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:29,790
What?

1080
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,890
Oh, I can't live that.

1081
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,950
Kobo, come here.

1082
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,410
Come here.

1083
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:36,910
You keep dying.

1084
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,210
Oh.

1085
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,070
Where did everybody go?

1086
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,510
Where did...

1087
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,850
Where did...

1088
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,710
Did we all die...

1089
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,310
Kill ourselves?

1090
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,010
I guess.

1091
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,150
I think...

1092
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,330
Either Kobo or Mint failed me.

1093
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,970
No, I definitely died first.

1094
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,790
Yay!

1095
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,730
King of the Losers.

1096
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,610
Oh, hell.

1097
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,830
King of the Losers.

1098
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,370
Yay!

1099
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,630
Let's pretend it never happened.

1100
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,570
Our stream begins now.

1101
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,670
That was a warm up.

1102
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,330
Hello, everybody.

1103
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,890
How good we are.

1104
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:26,850
Yay.

1105
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,470
Yay.

1106
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,570
Okay.

1107
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,890
It was a simulation.

1108
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,010
It was a Mirage.

1110
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,590
Yay.

1111
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,670
A Mirage?

1112
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,990
Let's get as much stuff as possible.

1113
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:38,870
Yeah.

1114
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,930
Headman Manor.

1115
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,470
Okay, wait.

1116
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,230
Don't get killed.

1117
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,710
Don't die.

1118
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,510
Don't look at me.

1119
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,550
Don't...

1120
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,410
Don't stay close to me.

1121
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,450
But you're...

1122
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,710
You're my child.

1123
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,470
Oh, what's this?

1124
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,390
But every time you stay close to me, I die.

1125
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,790
What's the creepy baby doll?

1126
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,710
Don't even touch it.

1127
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,330
That's the...

1128
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,370
I've never seen it before, but I don't think this is the thing.

1129
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,130
Oh my god.

1130
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,970
Why are you killing this child?

1131
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,970
So you just put it down, and it should be fine.

1132
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,650
Yeah, it just screams.

1133
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,570
Yeah, it just screams.

1134
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,270
It just screams.

1135
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,710
Oh my god.

1136
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,630
It's worth mega bucks.

1137
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,950
Yeah.

1138
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,950
Mega bucks.

1139
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,770
Mega bucks.

1140
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,390
Mega bucks.

1141
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,530
I keep hearing footsteps.

1142
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,650
I think there's...

1143
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,030
A monster nearby.

1144
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,210
Oh shit.

1145
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,510
Shit.

1146
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,350
Oh my god.

1147
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,210
I'm...

1148
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:32,910
I'm dizzy.

1149
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,030
Oh, you got this.

1150
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,730
You got this.

1151
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,430
You got this.

1152
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,370
I'm...

1153
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,450
Where's the box?

1154
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,030
Where's...

1155
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,810
Where's the box?

1156
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,550
Oh, right there.

1157
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,130
It's right there.

1158
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,490
Oh, you're almost there.

1159
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,490
Right here.

1160
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,410
Right here.

1161
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,930
Follow the sound of...

1162
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,390
Oh, wait.

1163
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,030
There's the box.

1164
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,430
You're right.

1165
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,970
Should we collect more to get more money?

1166
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,730
Like, for shopping?

1167
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,810
Something.

1168
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,830
Something.

1169
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,310
Something.

1170
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,290
Something.

1171
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,270
Oh, I hear.

1172
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,250
I hear.

1173
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,130
I hear something.

1174
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,050
Who's breaking shit?

1175
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,450
There's a 10k.

1176
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,130
Who's breaking stuff?

1177
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,710
What's up?

1178
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,490
It was off.

1179
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,410
What's up?

1180
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:22,690
What's up?

1181
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,030
10k.

1182
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,820
There's nothing here.

1183
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,740
What is noise safe?

1184
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,000
What is that sound?

1185
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,520
Yeah, I think there's nothing here.

1186
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,620
What was it?

1187
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,360
Nothing.

1188
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,540
The wind.

1189
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,600
Okay.

1190
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,760
Someone said maybe gnomes?

1191
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,980
Gnomes were killing it?

1192
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,400
Oh, the gnomes.

1193
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,600
You know what to do when you see gnomes?

1194
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
You just pick them up and throw them around.

1195
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,220
Oh, they're stupid.

1196
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,840
I forgot how to open map.

1197
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,980
Ah, tab.

1198
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,080
Tab.

1199
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,160
Tab.

1200
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,420
Is everybody okay?

1201
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,940
Yeah, we're okay.

1202
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,980
Yeah, I'm just sad.

1203
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
We lost like 3k for some reason.

1204
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,320
Aw.

1205
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,600
We got gnomed.

1206
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,740
We got gnomed.

1207
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,220
We got gnomed.

1208
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,020
No, I didn't see any gnomes.

1209
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,500
I didn't.

1210
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,260
You surprised me.

1211
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,600
I didn't either, actually.

1212
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:18,900
Not real.

1213
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,060
I'm following Kobo.

1214
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,380
Follow me.

1215
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,580
Follow my lead.

1216
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,120
Yeah.

1217
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,700
The professional.

1218
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,500
Nothing here.

1219
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,560
Professional killer.

1220
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,420
Nothing here.

1221
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,200
Nothing here.

1222
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,420
Let's go here.

1223
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:36,860
Okay.

1224
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,840
Oh, something here.

1225
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,760
Looting, looting here.

1226
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:41,820
Looting, looting here.

1227
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,960
Anything in the fridge?

1228
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,100
Nothing.

1229
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,260
No, no.

1230
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,480
This, this plate.

1231
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,980
Yo, Minto.

1232
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,560
The green plate.

1233
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:51,920
Okay.

1234
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,000
The green plate.

1235
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,720
Nice.

1236
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,880
This can break easily.

1237
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,220
Nice and easy.

1238
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,640
Nice and easy.

1239
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,020
Yes.

1240
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,460
Okay.

1241
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,140
Alright.

1242
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,180
I got a plate.

1243
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,980
Right here.

1244
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,900
Over here.

1245
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,980
I hear baby laughing.

1246
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,780
There's a baby.

1247
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,880
What was that?

1248
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,680
Just done.

1249
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,640
What

1250
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,640
is it?

1251
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,780
It was, it was scary as fuck.

1252
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,460
That doesn't...

1253
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:28,840
Okay.

1254
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,460
It was tall?

1255
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,080
It was tall?

1256
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,460
And it...

1257
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,900
It...

1258
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,280
It...

1259
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,000
It was Enderman.

1260
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,420
Or something like that.

1261
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,900
Tall, dark, and handsome?

1262
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,760
Handsome?

1263
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,600
Not so much.

1264
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,100
But tall and dark, yeah.

1265
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,840
Just don't look at...

1266
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,520
The eyes.

1267
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,220
Okay.

1268
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,500
You'll be...

1269
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,280
You'll be chill.

1270
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,260
He's chill.

1271
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,980
He's chill.

1272
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,840
It's over there.

1273
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,600
It's literally an Enderman.

1274
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,100
When you hear...

1275
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,600
When you hear...

1276
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,820
When you hear child laughter...

1277
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,740
We should take it seriously, actually.

1278
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,580
I was joking before, but...

1279
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:00,820
Oh.

1280
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,160
I...

1281
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,140
I put the cart in the...

1282
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,060
What's it called again?

1283
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,120
The...

1284
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,340
The landing spot, okay?

1285
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,280
Okay.

1286
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,390
Diamond.

1287
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,190
Careful of that.

1288
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,530
Do you know how to pull something closer to you and further away?

1289
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:17,230
No.

1290
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:17,970
Oh, like this?

1291
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:18,370
Scroll.

1292
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,610
Yeah, crawl.

1293
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,350
Good, good, good.

1294
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,830
Wait, where's the...

1295
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,830
Where's the...

1296
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,430
Bucket?

1297
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,330
Or the basket?

1298
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,250
Oh, it's a...

1299
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,450
It's in the landing spot.

1300
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,210
Okay.

1301
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,630
Where is that?

1302
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,370
I'll find it.

1303
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:39,380
I love her.

1304
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,180
I love her.

1305
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:47,960
Okay.

1306
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,400
Nice and easy.

1307
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,700
Sorry.

1308
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:56,980
Sorry.

1309
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,040
Sorry guys.

1310
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,340
Hold on.

1311
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,240
Let me take some sippy.

1312
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
I love...

1313
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
I love her.

1314
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,320
No.

1315
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,200
No.

1316
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,580
Sorry.

1317
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,420
Oh.

1318
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:21,860
Oops.

1319
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,020
Didn't mean that.

1320
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,900
I saw...

1321
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,280
Nothing.

1322
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,120
Thank you.

1323
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,200
Ew, this is so much money.

1324
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,320
I can get more.

1325
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:32,920
Oh, oops.

1326
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,020
Oh, we're gonna be...

1327
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,040
Loaded.

1328
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,000
Oop.

1329
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:36,980
Oop.

1330
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:37,580
Oop.

1331
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,900
Oop.

1332
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,040
Oop.

1333
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,000
Oop.

1334
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,060
Oop.

1335
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,810
We're gonna be rich bitches.

1336
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,810
We're rich bitches.

1337
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:50,850
We are rich bitches.

1338
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,570
We are rich bitches.

1339
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:53,610
Oh.

1340
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,410
And there's no monsters here.

1341
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,050
This house is empty.

1342
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,930
Don't jinx it.

1343
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,770
I haven't seen this.

1344
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,390
What you got there?

1345
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,770
A doll.

1346
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,210
Oops, shit.

1347
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:09,310
Sorry.

1348
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,010
Why'd you do that to the doll?

1349
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:11,830
Classic.

1350
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,230
Sorry.

1351
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:14,510
Classic.

1352
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,210
She's like, I don't want this doll.

1353
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,110
I want a new doll.

1354
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,870
New doll.

1355
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,450
I want this doll.

1356
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,410
I want this doll.

1357
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,800
I hear that shit all the time, man.

1358
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,760
All the time.

1359
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,400
From who?

1360
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,360
From who?

1361
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,920
Oh, it must be so hard being a mom.

1362
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,180
Yeah, like she doesn't even appreciate all the things I do for her.

1363
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,120
Ew, this painting is creepy.

1364
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,950
I don't like that.

1365
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:47,770
It's sad.

1366
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,530
I can barely see it, though.

1367
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,790
It's creepy, creepy.

1368
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,910
Okay.

1369
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,870
Shouldn't you be into that kind of shit?

1370
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:58,810
I am.

1371
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,500
Oh.

1372
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,420
There's a money over there in the fridge.

1373
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,040
Money in the fridge.

1374
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,760
Money in the fridge.

1375
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,160
Anything in here?

1376
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,440
The monkey might be noisy.

1377
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,380
Fucking monkey.

1378
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,800
Nothing in here.

1379
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,260
Okay.

1380
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,460
Be careful.

1381
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,060
Fucking monkey.

1382
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,820
Fucking monkey.

1383
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,320
The monkey.

1384
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,240
Monkey.

1385
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,420
Monkey.

1386
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,800
There should be something over... Oh.

1387
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,520
Mint.

1388
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,080
There's a... There's a... Cash over here.

1389
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,540
There's cash and there's a... There's a little goblet.

1390
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,020
Oh, then we can bring it together.

1391
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,500
Oh.

1392
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,440
I'm really bad at... How does the money lose its value?

1393
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,020
I don't understand.

1394
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,320
Um... I'm not sure.

1395
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,720
Got my goblet.

1396
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,720
Got my goblet.

1397
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Oh.

1398
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,220
Got a goblet.

1399
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,420
I got my goblet.

1400
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,020
Oh.

1401
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,460
Oh.

1402
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,540
Oh.

1403
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,700
Um... Something just grabbed... Tears.

1404
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:23,760
Oh.

1405
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,620
Yeah.

1406
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,520
Tears.

1407
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,000
There was... Pink.

1408
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,000
Nice.

1409
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:28,780
Hi.

1410
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,680
Hi.

1411
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,680
Welcome back.

1412
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,020
Hi.

1413
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,080
What happened?

1414
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,220
Um... I don't know.

1415
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:36,820
There was...

1416
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,120
It was like a centipede baby.

1417
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,060
It grabbed me.

1418
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,620
Yeah.

1419
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,380
It literally said... Yoink.

1420
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,240
Yeah.

1421
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:43,840
Alright.

1422
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,320
Yoink.

1423
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,560
Am I dead?

1424
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:45,980
Yoink.

1425
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,080
Cool.

1426
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Alright.

1427
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,940
Maybe we're... Maybe we can call it... Oh.

1428
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:50,960
Sorry.

1429
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,560
Oh.

1430
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:51,940
Sorry.

1431
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:52,900
Sorry.

1432
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,780
Sorry.

1433
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,820
Sorry.

1434
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:54,820
Sorry.

1435
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Sorry.

1436
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:55,980
Sorry.

1437
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,320
That's so much money.

1438
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,160
We're killing it.

1439
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,280
Yeah.

1440
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,280
That's all.

1441
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,580
Yeah.

1442
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,260
Let's put it in.

1443
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,300
Let's go.

1444
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,660
Let's go.

1445
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,120
Captain.

1446
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,260
Captain.

1447
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,700
We absolutely emptied this house.

1448
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,380
Bye-bye.

1449
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,220
Bye-bye.

1450
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,420
Nice.

1451
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,920
Finally the IT girls have proofed themselves.

1452
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:12,500
Yeah.

1453
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,960
Yeah.

1454
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,120
We are worthy.

1455
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,560
Yes.

1456
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,640
Big money.

1457
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,940
Good job, girlies.

1458
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,440
Good job.

1459
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,860
Woo-hoo.

1460
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:21,620
Yeah.

1461
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,480
Wow.

1462
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,780
20,000K.

1463
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,360
Get back to the truck.

1464
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,200
Damn.

1465
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,480
Shit.

1466
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,100
Let's go.

1467
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,340
Let's go.

1468
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,520
Good job.

1469
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:33,820
Hell yeah.

1470
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,420
Great job.

1471
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,980
And not that many monsters too.

1472
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,100
Just a centipede baby.

1473
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Yeah.

1474
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,200
Mm-hmm.

1475
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,100
What's... Do I... Do this?

1476
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:40,520
Wait.

1477
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,240
How do I do this?

1478
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:41,540
Yeah.

1479
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,640
Yeah.

1480
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,380
Shopping time.

1481
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,960
Shopping.

1482
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:47,800
Yippee.

1483
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,320
Yeah.

1484
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Yeah.

1485
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,480
Alright.

1486
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,600
You can buy a new Barbie doll for Bookaboo.

1487
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,540
There's a Barbie doll?

1488
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,700
No.

1489
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,320
There might be.

1490
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,600
I don't... I don't need dolls.

1491
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,200
What do we got?

1492
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,420
What do we need?

1493
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,300
Grenades.

1494
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,140
We need grenades.

1495
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,640
We need... Power.

1496
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,020
Power.

1497
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1498
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,560
Strength.

1499
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,720
I want... Strength.

1500
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,760
I want strength.

1501
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,580
Me too.

1502
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,020
I want... This feels like that show where kids go into...

1503
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:29,100
Like with the cart, they go into a toy store, a big one, and they rush through it on a time limit.

1504
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,400
And then from all the aisle, they can bring us... They can take as many toys and games as they want.

1505
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,340
And then... And then... Yeah, that was the... The stickiest shit ever.

1506
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:40,640
Anyway.

1507
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,880
What the... Yeah!

1508
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,280
You're... You know what I mean?

1509
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:48,660
Your description sounded like a child describing that show.

1510
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:56,760
And then... And then they... Go to the store... And then... And then they... And then they... Yeah!

1511
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:57,280
Yeah!

1512
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,400
Yeah!

1513
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:02,530
Yeah!

1514
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,850
What are these upgrades, man?

1515
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:04,870
What is this shit?

1516
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,110
I want something...

1517
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,190
Eww, toilet.

1518
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:07,890
Wait.

1519
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,630
Yeah, shut the lid.

1520
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,690
I'm sorry.

1521
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,310
It's the water closet.

1522
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,950
It's the water closet.

1523
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:18,610
It's the water closet.

1524
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:18,630
Oh?

1525
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,010
What is that?

1526
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:20,370
Wait.

1527
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,630
A crouch rest.

1528
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,170
Oh!

1529
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:23,850
I'm not sure!

1530
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,950
I thought this was stamina!

1531
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,230
What's a crouch...

1532
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,030
Rest of grief.

1533
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,850
There's no stamina in the store right now!

1534
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:30,230
It's...

1535
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,510
I haven't heard about crouch rest.

1536
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,250
What is a phase bridge?

1537
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,350
I don't know.

1538
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,050
Extra jump.

1539
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,030
There's a lot of new stuff.

1540
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:42,250
Extra jump.

1541
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:42,870
Oh!

1542
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:43,450
Wait.

1543
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,730
I'm not trying to grab that.

1544
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,170
That was mine.

1545
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,530
I mean, that sounds cool.

1546
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,970
I would like crouch...

1547
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,870
Stamina.

1548
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:52,830
Really?

1549
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,490
Connect?

1550
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:53,950
Yeah.

1551
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,470
It's a mobile bridge.

1552
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:55,870
Sure.

1553
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,410
Tumble launch could be cool.

1554
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,550
Is it like...

1555
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,270
Is it like jumping or tumble?

1556
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,750
Oh, I know right inside.

1557
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:07,730
Okay.

1558
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,090
Okay.

1559
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,550
Mint.

1560
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:13,290
Yeah?

1561
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,890
Can you press Q real quick?

1562
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,190
I didn't... we all...

1563
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,970
That is too much.

1564
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:18,930
I didn't...

1565
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,810
17...

1566
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,210
Whoa!

1567
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,690
What happened?

1568
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:22,830
Something exploded!

1569
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,970
It might have been the duck.

1570
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,070
Q?

1571
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:28,930
Yes.

1572
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,210
Now come with me.

1573
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:30,690
Okay.

1574
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:32,590
Are you throwing...

1575
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,590
Are you giving me...

1576
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,650
A wet willy!

1577
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:35,890
A swirly!

1578
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:36,950
No!

1579
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:38,970
No!

1580
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:39,990
Please!

1581
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,490
Come in here!

1582
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,130
No!

1583
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:43,650
No!

1584
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:44,510
Don't put me!

1585
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:45,590
Don't...

1586
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:45,990
No!

1587
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,270
Don't put me in the toilet!

1588
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,710
Lose it!

1589
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,690
Lose it!

1590
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,990
Lose it!

1591
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,450
Lose it!

1592
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,290
Lose it!

1593
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,370
Lose it!

1594
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:00,490
Please!

1595
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,070
Please, Arlie please!

1596
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:03,130
Don't...

1597
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,710
Don't put me in the toilet!

1598
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,370
That's that part of it!

1599
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,630
I'm sure you enjoyed that!

1600
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,150
Why does this always happen to me?

1601
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,380
I'm pushing the button.

1602
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,560
Wait, it said 17,000 for me.

1603
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,600
We only have grenades.

1604
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,600
Not really any weapon.

1605
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,700
Oh, there's a frying pan.

1606
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,440
Oh, we can't afford that.

1607
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,600
I'll turn my frying pan into a drying pan.

1608
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,840
I bet you like those jelly-filled donuts, too.

1609
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,340
Ow!

1610
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:56,800
Ow!

1611
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,340
Oh, sorry!

1612
00:52:59,920 --> 00:52:59,920
Ow!

1613
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:00,740
Ow!

1614
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,880
Was that payback for the toilet?

1615
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,540
Yeah.

1616
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,300
Probably okay?

1617
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,910
She wants your milk.

1618
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,850
Who doesn't really?

1619
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,530
My milk is inside a man.

1620
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,630
I'm kidding.

1621
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,670
That's not what she said.

1622
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,070
I learned something today.

1623
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,130
I learned something.

1624
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,830
She said she does.

1625
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,160
Aren't you gonna deliver?

1626
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,340
Aren't you gonna deliver?

1627
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,620
Me?

1628
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,420
Oh, she's coming!

1629
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,020
Let them confuse me.

1630
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,100
Okay.

1631
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,720
Azi is mother's milk.

1632
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1633
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:23,860
Yes.

1634
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,560
Here, I'll try this explosive mine.

1635
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,000
Does somebody know how you even activate it?

1636
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,600
I've never successfully activated something like this.

1637
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,520
Me too.

1638
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:38,900
Let's try.

1639
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,340
Yeah, I just don't want it to blow up in my face, you know?

1640
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,120
That's...

1641
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,520
You throw it and then it activates immediately or...

1642
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,840
How does that work?

1643
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:51,960
It's a...

1644
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,780
You gotta experiment.

1645
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,780
Okay.

1646
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,240
And the rest of the money now, does it just stay with us until the next dropping spree?

1647
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,220
Yeah!

1648
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,320
I think so, yeah.

1649
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:01,620
Okay.

1650
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,060
Hopefully they have better upgrades then.

1651
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,340
Let's go!

1652
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:07,660
Oh!

1653
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,360
You activate E and put somewhere.

1654
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,060
Oh, I can rotate with the right.

1655
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:19,680
Okay.

1656
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm getting the tutorial, why?

1657
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,380
Power...

1658
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:25,920
Power...

1659
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,220
Oh, oh, it's not going off.

1660
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:39,900
Oh, it's okay.

1661
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,520
Uh, don't...

1662
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,140
I think you just...

1663
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,460
maybe don't walk into it.

1664
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,020
Maybe it's React 2 when...

1665
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,720
Oh, it's...

1666
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:46,980
Ah!

1667
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,040
Mint, you little shits.

1668
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,020
What is wrong with you?

1669
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,120
The shit is wrong with you!

1670
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,840
I do it again.

1671
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,620
This is your mission!

1672
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,480
I do it again.

1673
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,940
I'd do it a hundred times if I could!

1674
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,740
Yay!

1675
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,480
Fucking shit, man.

1676
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,520
Okay.

1677
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,360
You little menace.

1678
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,800
God damn it.

1679
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,980
Well, it was partially my fault.

1680
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,540
That's for real.

1681
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,680
Yeah, it was.

1682
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,360
Oh, there's still an upgrade here.

1683
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,840
Someone upgrade.

1684
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,000
What is it?

1685
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,860
First upgrade?

1686
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,100
Somebody... only you wanted it, right?

1687
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,460
Right, I wanted it.

1688
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,440
What is it?

1689
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:47,840
Thank you.

1690
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,560
It's a crouch rest.

1691
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,260
Oh.

1692
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,140
Oh, shit.

1693
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,380
We're in the castle.

1694
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,080
Yeah.

1695
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,870
It's the...

1696
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,830
Headmaster run.

1697
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,750
Him?

1698
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:05,990
Good job.

1699
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,370
That guy...

1700
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,070
Doesn't look like he can even finish a hot dog.

1701
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:12,330
Yeah.

1702
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,190
Oh, shit.

1703
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,250
I want a hot dog.

1704
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,390
Thanks for the idea.

1705
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,090
You're welcome.

1706
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:17,710
Be careful.

1707
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,150
Diamond, walk him through.

1708
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,310
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

1709
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,150
Monkey with the money.

1710
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,230
I'm dying.

1711
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:31,290
I was gonna keep it150.

1712
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,190
Oh.

1713
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,250
Oh, there's a...

1714
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,610
Oh.

1715
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:35,390
Diamond, diamond.

1716
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,790
King of losers.

1717
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,830
King of losers.

1718
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,750
King of losers.

1719
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,690
Oh...

1720
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,450
Poor girl.

1721
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:46,050
I put some things in the area, not in the box.

1722
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,910
There's a diamond in the area.

1723
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:50,910
Don't squish it.

1724
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,290
Kobo so strong.

1725
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,230
Kobo... Wait.

1726
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,110
This is very pushy.

1727
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,150
It's like I'm watching brain surgery.

1728
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,350
No, no, no, no.

1729
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:18,890
No, no, no, no, no.

1730
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,920
No, no.

1731
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,900
No, no, no.

1732
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,040
Shit!

1733
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,260
What happened?

1734
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,260
Okay.

1735
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,080
Okay.

1736
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,640
We don't want to extract...

1737
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,500
We don't want to... Okay,

1738
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,340
I think it's safe.

1739
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:22,960
Okay.

1740
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,820
No, no.

1741
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,200
Oh, it was you.

1742
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,440
I thought it was the guy.

1743
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,640
No, he was also there.

1744
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,260
He was also there.

1745
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,020
Oh, okay, okay.

1746
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,060
Who said my name?

1747
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,230
Was that him?

1748
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,750
No, I was not here.

1749
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,270
Where is my child?

1750
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:26,970
I lost her already.

1751
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:30,690
Nice.

1752
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,790
Okay.

1753
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,190
There was some more...

1754
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,470
Oh, hi!

1755
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,270
Oh, hi!

1756
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,390
Be graced by the king of the losers!

1757
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,010
I'm your first knight.

1758
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,130
What?

1759
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,130
I'm...

1760
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,010
I'm the...

1761
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:01,590
You know...

1762
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,210
How like...

1763
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,090
You're the king...

1764
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:03,930
And I'm the knight?

1765
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,430
Oh...

1766
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,380
Does that mean...

1767
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,720
Oh...

1768
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:17,830
Oh...

1769
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,950
Why are you hesitating?

1770
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,470
Uh...

1771
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,850
You like being here?

1772
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:31,540
It gets pretty lonely, you know?

1773
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,660
So it's nice to have company.

1774
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,700
Yeah, I get it.

1775
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,820
We're the dead ones.

1776
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:37,720
Literally.

1777
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
Wow, wow, wow.

1778
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,360
Anyway...

1779
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:46,900
Well...

1780
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,260
Uh...

1781
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,340
It's their problem now.

1782
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,580
Now they gotta...

1783
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,080
collect everything in our state.

1784
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,140
But we have enough money that they could revive us.

1785
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,340
They just choose not to.

1786
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1787
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,020
Yeah.

1788
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,560
So being a ghost and all, have you ever like...

1789
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,920
Possessed the body?

1790
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,220
Yeah, like...

1791
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,600
Tons.

1792
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,680
Tons?

1793
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,760
Yeah, like...

1794
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,540
Everybody in my chat could probably raise their hand.

1795
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,120
They got possessed by you?

1796
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1797
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,120
What do you do?

1798
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,820
How does it feel when you're in someone else's body?

1799
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,400
It...

1800
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:31,340
Depends.

1801
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,140
It's kinda like...

1802
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,880
Being wrapped in a blanket.

1803
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,520
Oh...

1804
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,060
What do zombies do?

1805
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,160
Uh...

1806
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,980
You know...

1807
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,400
We...

1808
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,520
We do math, homework...

1809
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,200
Sometimes we'd read...

1810
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:49,730
History books...

1811
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,180
I think this is...

1812
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,480
Enough.

1813
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,340
Oh...

1814
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,300
Yeah!

1815
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,680
You wanna try...

1816
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,520
Going inside of me?

1817
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,520
For the second...

1818
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,360
Okay, you'll be double dead.

1819
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,400
It's gonna turn it into...

1820
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,880
I think...

1821
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,400
Might as well...

1822
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,320
Double it and give it to the next person now.

1823
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,500
We can break anything...

1824
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,320
I hope...

1825
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,280
Nah...

1826
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,020
Okay...

1827
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,180
Yarr...

1828
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,120
Alright, I'm going in!

1829
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,820
Oli, I'm going in!

1830
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,760
Work, work, work...

1831
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,300
Work, work, work...

1832
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,460
Work, work, work...

1833
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,460
Work, work, work...

1834
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,280
I can't believe you guys died by like...

1835
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,220
One of the easiest mobs in the entire game.

1836
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:43,840
I'm gonna...

1837
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,860
You just don't speak?

1838
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,100
I didn't see it!

1839
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,520
I ran right into him!

1840
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:52,960
Well...

1841
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,120
Losers...

1842
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,600
Whatever...

1843
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,180
Whatever...

1844
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,100
What was that?

1845
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,320
I'm healing you...

1846
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:01,960
Aw, thanks!

1847
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,640
A little...

1848
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,300
You love me or something!

1849
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,920
A little...

1850
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,960
Haha, thank you!

1851
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,600
Now we all have 20...

1852
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,300
I think...

1853
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1854
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,060
Okie dokie!

1855
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,200
So now we just gotta look for the new extractor point, right?

1856
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,800
Yep!

1857
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,860
I think I saw the...

1858
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,720
Yeah, this hasn't been...

1859
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Wait...

1860
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
What's yellow mean?

1861
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,100
It means really big item!

1862
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,600
It's moving though...

1863
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:34,680
Huh?

1864
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,580
Then maybe Kobo has it!

1865
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,340
Oh, Kobo has it!

1866
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,300
Yep!

1867
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,140
There he is!

1868
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,960
Is there enough room?

1869
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,660
It's a...

1870
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,220
Potion...

1871
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,960
Yeah, but we don't have enough room in the cart.

1872
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,680
It's okay, I'm...

1873
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,540
I'll carry it.

1874
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,240
Okay...

1875
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,900
So maybe the extraction point is...

1876
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,140
It will?

1877
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,780
Over here?

1878
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,140
I bought some...

1879
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:04,700
Oh...

1880
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,640
Oops...

1881
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,380
We good...

1882
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,200
Oh, I guess there's nothing else over here...

1883
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,580
Is it?

1884
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,800
Oh, it's not this way!

1885
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:15,440
Is it...

1886
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,740
Wait, wait, wait...

1887
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,260
Nope, no, not this way...

1888
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,140
Oh!

1889
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,740
Okay...

1890
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,240
This is...

1891
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,120
This is where...

1892
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,440
You know...

1893
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,000
You wanna...

1894
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,440
Wait...

1895
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,460
Kiwawa, come here, come here.

1896
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,320
Hey...

1897
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,180
You wanna...

1898
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:28,520
Yeah?

1899
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,080
You wanna play...

1900
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,760
Seven minutes in heaven?

1901
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,620
I actually don't know how it works!

1902
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,560
Tell me!

1903
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,140
Um...

1904
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,900
You just...

1905
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,220
Close your eyes?

1906
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,180
Okay...

1907
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,220
Closing...

1908
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,420
I'll do the rest, baby girl!

1909
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,240
Ow!

1910
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:51,740
Ow!

1911
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,490
Ew!

1912
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:55,290
Oh!

1913
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:57,750
Why'd she run?

1914
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,350
What?

1915
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,250
Why'd she run from me?

1916
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,610
I'm shy!

1917
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,130
Oh, you're shy!

1918
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,130
Heee!

1919
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,510
It's so cute!

1920
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:08,310
Heee!

1921
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:09,410
Heee!

1922
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:09,970
Heee!

1923
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:10,030
Heee!

1924
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,810
Okay, I'm sick of this already.

1925
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:13,670
Oh, yeah.

1926
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,970
The bit is done.

1927
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:15,630
The bit's over.

1928
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,210
It's over.

1929
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:17,870
Yeah, okay.

1930
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,210
We need to know when...

1931
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:19,630
You know...

1932
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,810
When to move on to the next bit.

1933
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,950
I know, I know.

1934
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,370
I'm ready.

1935
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,250
I can move...

1936
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,190
I'm ready to move on.

1937
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,050
Okay...

1938
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:26,230
Oh!

1939
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,090
I found cash money, baby!

1940
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:30,970
I found it, too.

1941
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:31,650
Oh!

1942
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:32,570
You can have it!

1943
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:33,690
Oh!

1944
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,290
Hi!

1945
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,590
That's what happens when I...

1946
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,890
You can have it, she says, while I rip it out of her.

1947
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:43,390
No, I gave it to you.

1948
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,290
Are there any other stuff?

1949
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:45,610
Yeah, yeah.

1950
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,270
What is this?

1951
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,030
Oh!

1952
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,550
We could go...

1953
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,910
This is...

1954
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:53,830
Heavy.

1955
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,270
What is this?

1956
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:02,650
Okay, after this, the monster will spawn, and we need to run.

1957
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:03,890
Okay.

1958
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,250
Lift it, lift it, lift it.

1959
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:08,090
One, two, three.

1960
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:11,070
Oh!

1961
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,090
My stamina is so bad!

1962
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:13,670
Okay!

1963
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,310
Okay!

1964
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:16,750
Whoa!

1965
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:18,050
From there?

1966
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:18,530
Big money?

1967
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,010
Okay, let's run.

1968
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:23,750
From there?

1969
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,770
Which way?

1970
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,440
I'm getting...

1971
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:30,940
There's a gnome!

1972
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,620
There's a gnome!

1973
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,140
I'm getting gnomed?

1974
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,130
Be careful of the gnomes!

1975
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,180
I think it's this way.

1976
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,680
I'm so slow.

1977
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,120
Oh!

1978
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:45,160
Oh!

1979
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:45,920
Gnomes!

1980
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,500
There...

1981
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,380
There's also the...

1982
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,140
What?

1983
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:04,960
Oopsie!

1984
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,320
I just need to leave.

1985
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,280
Oh my god!

1986
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Oh gosh!

1987
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,540
Go!

1988
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:17,620
No!

1989
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,260
She's just laughing!

1990
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,680
Why is she laughing?

1991
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,980
Guy, what's going on?

1992
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,680
She still can revive us, right?

1993
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:25,880
She can?

1994
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:26,820
I think you!

1995
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,100
Cobo has a chance.

1996
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:29,700
Yeah, there you go.

1997
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,240
Yes!

1998
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,140
Oh!

1999
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,740
Oh, yeah, right?

2000
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,040
My god!

2001
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:41,240
Yeah!

2002
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,380
I didn't know he would do that!

2003
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,460
And once again...

2004
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,360
I lived!

2005
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,840
Yeah, you did!

2006
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,600
You know what?

2007
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,960
I think you should take...

2008
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,100
Damn!

2009
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,900
Oh yeah, you should take the lead!

2010
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2011
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:05,620
Oh!

2012
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:05,900
Yeah!

2013
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:06,780
Thank you!

2014
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,920
I just want some stamina.

2015
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,860
Oh, look at these shitty upgrades!

2016
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,160
There's one stamina upgrade!

2017
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,760
Wait, this is range.

2018
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,680
There's so much money!

2019
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:16,320
Strength!

2020
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,000
Thank you so much for your raid!

2021
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,860
I would like to heal up a little bit.

2022
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,420
Yeah, yeah.

2023
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,800
We've become beefy!

2024
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,100
Tumble wings!

2025
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,180
What the heck is this?

2026
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:30,600
Hi!

2027
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,360
Thank you!

2028
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,240
What is a tumble wing?

2029
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,300
I'm sorry, I didn't notice.

2030
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,540
You're so funny!

2031
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:45,580
Hi!

2032
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,180
Time to put you...

2033
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,440
No!

2034
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:49,940
No!

2035
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:50,300
No!

2036
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,360
How do you make that face?

2037
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,900
How do you make that face?

2038
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,320
What?

2039
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,340
How do you...

2040
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,440
Is it like an emote?

2041
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,980
Yeah!

2042
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,260
So if you...

2043
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,240
Press the numbers...

2044
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,580
Five to nine, I think?

2045
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,720
Oh, I think...

2046
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,400
You can do like...

2047
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,340
A bunch of other...

2048
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:07,540
Yeah!

2049
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,320
I'm watching you...

2050
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,080
Takaki-chan!

2051
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,320
I see...

2052
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,700
I see...

2053
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,780
Yeah, it's so fun!

2054
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,360
Isn't it?

2055
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,860
My pupils are enlarged.

2056
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,980
Why do you look so mad?

2057
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:35,980
Cause...

2058
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,020
Cause I'm...

2059
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,800
Cause...

2060
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,660
Cause...

2061
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,520
I spilled my milk!

2062
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:39,700
My!

2063
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,060
My!

2064
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:40,600
Oh, she's...

2065
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:41,920
Unreal!

2066
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,340
Oh my god!

2067
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,200
What's this?

2068
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,020
What are you guys getting?

2069
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:49,580
Ranch!

2070
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,860
I got...

2071
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,620
One...

2072
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,320
Little...

2073
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,340
Small health pack...

2074
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,660
And the stamina pack...

2075
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,480
And...

2076
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,080
Uh...

2077
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,040
A health upgrade.

2078
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,600
But I don't have to have all of those.

2079
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,240
Bye!

2080
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,140
Oh!

2081
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,700
I would love more health!

2082
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,960
Yeah, me too!

2083
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,040
Okay, get the health upgrade.

2084
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,120
I will take the stamina upgrade, though.

2085
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:10,580
Um...

2086
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,880
I'm gonna buy HP!

2087
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,320
I'll buy...

2088
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,420
Wait, 5k versus 10k...

2089
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,420
Oh, it's just...

2090
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,540
Honestly, even though this group, like, dies all the time...

2091
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:26,780
Um...

2092
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,240
Uh-huh...

2093
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,440
I feel like we make...

2094
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,400
The most money out of all the Repo Flubs I've ever had.

2095
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,340
Really?

2096
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:33,760
Yeah.

2097
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,080
What's going on?

2098
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,740
I think it's because we have a good luck charm.

2099
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,080
Oh!

2100
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,420
Is it...

2101
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:44,560
Minto?

2102
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:45,760
Yeah!

2103
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,040
Minto in the toilet!

2104
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,600
That's our good luck charm.

2105
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,760
I don't want any other one to stop.

2106
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,820
Get in the toilet!

2107
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:51,740
No!

2108
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:52,960
Get in it!

2109
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:53,780
Wait...

2110
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,000
No!

2111
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:54,740
Please!

2112
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,380
Please don't put me in the toilet!

2113
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,420
No!

2114
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:58,800
Please!

2115
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,520
It's more the better of the team...

2116
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:00,960
No!

2117
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,400
No!

2118
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:02,960
No!

2119
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,160
Please!

2120
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh, please!

2121
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:04,840
Oh, please!

2122
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,660
Don't put me back in the toilet!

2123
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,420
Oh, no!

2124
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,760
That's part of parenthood!

2125
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:09,960
No!

2126
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,200
Hey, hey!

2127
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,920
Can you open the doors, please?

2128
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:13,660
I guess...

2129
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,740
Oh...

2130
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,180
Please!

2131
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,360
No, please!

2132
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,500
I already did this to the end of the day!

2133
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,180
We close the door, we don't care, just be at...

2134
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:26,720
Are you okay?

2135
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,900
Do you need a good life?

2136
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,440
Isn't

2137
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:36,770
that great?

2138
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:38,750
I'm just like... wait.

2139
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,230
I'm just like Hanako.

2140
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:42,670
Yeah!

2141
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:43,850
A ghost in the toilet!

2142
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,430
What would you... okay.

2143
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,250
Ghost in the toilet.

2144
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:48,370
What is your wisdom?

2145
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,890
Oh wait, that's me.

2146
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,810
I should be asking that!

2147
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,390
That's me!

2148
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,660
I'm a zombie, remember?

2149
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,140
Yeah, I know.

2150
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,200
Why do you look so sad out of the toilet?

2151
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,140
Because parenthood is just... exhausting.

2152
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,940
You say that with that face.

2153
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,970
It's okay.

2154
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,390
So, are we... are we going to buy all of these?

2155
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:26,080
Parenthood doesn't come with a manual.

2156
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,510
It comes from the heart.

2157
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,450
It comes from the heart.

2158
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,510
Or it comes with a...

2159
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,090
Well, manual.

2160
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,450
Whoa!

2161
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,370
You!

2162
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,150
You!

2163
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,170
You!

2164
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,440
Stop laughing!

2165
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,720
She's laughing!

2166
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,700
I'm not laughing!

2167
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,680
Please do you!

2168
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,940
Ah, she kissed me!

2169
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:04,560
Okay, let's buy!

2170
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,080
Bye, bye, bye!

2171
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:09,670
I'm going in!

2172
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:12,690
Girl, go in!

2173
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,970
Do not go in.

2174
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,190
Unless you mean the toilet.

2175
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,590
You want to go into the toilet?

2176
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:19,210
No!

2177
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:20,470
No!

2178
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,090
Are you having a tummy ache?

2179
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,390
Kind of.

2180
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:31,430
Uh-oh.

2181
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,930
You need to make a booboo again?

2182
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:38,290
The what?

2183
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,130
I wrap your tummy.

2184
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,430
You didn't even wipe my butt.

2185
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,710
I did!

2186
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,230
I did!

2187
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,590
That's why I said you're not a little shit anymore.

2188
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:51,470
You're a big shit!

2189
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,110
A big shit!

2190
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:54,710
Oh.

2191
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,870
Okay.

2192
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,610
They grow up so fast.

2193
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,070
So fast.

2194
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:05,630
First, they're pooping, and then they ask you to wipe their butt.

2195
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:18,500
Mine.

2196
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,260
Mine.

2197
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,260
Oh, shoot, I took the wrong one.

2198
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,060
I'm so stuck.

2199
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,340
Wait!

2200
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,400
Take my stamina upgrade!

2201
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,080
I took the health upgrade by accident.

2202
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:31,360
Sprint speed?

2203
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,120
Oh!

2204
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,400
Oh, thank you!

2205
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,040
Femina.

2206
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,160
I was brain empty.

2207
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,120
Yeah!

2208
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:38,620
Okay.

2209
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,200
You're on the wrong one.

2210
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:40,940
Oopsie.

2211
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,380
Does that also go off in five seconds?

2212
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,880
I mean, take the health.

2213
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,940
Yes, I'm taking.

2214
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,320
Nice!

2215
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:49,780
Bokobo!

2216
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,240
Yeah.

2217
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,700
Did you not need to take anything?

2218
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:54,820
I did.

2219
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,020
Okay, good.

2220
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,500
Dad, once again!

2221
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,180
Can you heal me?

2222
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:00,800
Holy shawl.

2223
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:01,720
Aw.

2224
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,610
Wawa?

2225
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:10,730
Did your cover happen?

2226
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:12,450
What?

2227
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:13,030
What?

2228
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,470
Did your cover happen?

2229
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:16,410
My...

2230
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,450
I think it's Wawa right?

2231
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,390
Wait, how much is your health right now?

2232
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,510
One.

2233
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,190
Shit.

2234
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:23,990
Let me give you some...

2235
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,270
Thank you.

2236
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:27,350
Okay, okay, okay.

2237
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:27,890
Okay.

2238
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,810
Let's go.

2239
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,710
Oh, it's similar to last time.

2240
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:34,170
Yeah.

2241
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:36,570
What?

2242
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:38,970
Come here at once.

2243
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,910
No!

2244
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:44,590
Right, I don't need to go into every toilet.

2245
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:47,390
Actually, this one looks pretty clean.

2246
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:48,030
Okay.

2247
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:51,770
We've...

2248
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:53,590
Toilet bound.

2249
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,030
Watch.

2250
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,100
Ah, there's it!

2251
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,260
Oh, gosh.

2252
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,820
That does not...

2253
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,820
Eye!

2254
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,720
I closed my eyes, so it wouldn't get, you know.

2255
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:12,460
Oh, okay, okay.

2256
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,760
Does it feel like a roller coaster?

2257
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,140
Yeah, pretty good.

2258
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,000
I think I'm gonna throw up.

2259
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,820
Now get to work!

2260
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,560
Lazy bones!

2261
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,340
Get to work!

2262
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,480
I can't get up!

2263
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,420
I can't get up!

2264
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,600
Excuse me, excuse me!

2265
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,420
Uh...

2266
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,640
Okay, what is that?

2267
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,080
A TV!

2268
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,820
Why does she wanna put me in the toilet so much?

2269
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,020
I think...

2270
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,780
She's obsessed with the toilet.

2271
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:41,640
What creature?

2272
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,460
There's a creature?

2273
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,640
Can you guys hear my laptop?

2274
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,460
It's like going...

2275
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,380
Okay, I got it.

2276
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,440
Ew!

2277
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,780
I heard a music.

2278
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,200
Oops.

2279
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,500
Oops, nobody saw.

2280
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,680
Nobody saw.

2281
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,750
Oops.

2282
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:21,430
Oops.

2283
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,770
Nobody saw.

2284
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:38,760
Is it the clown?

2285
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,340
Why is there spooky music?

2286
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,120
Is it the...

2287
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,800
What the hell is that?

2288
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,300
Oh, God!

2289
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,460
How do I get out?

2290
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,420
Are you okay?

2291
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,660
I got attacked by a creature!

2292
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:06,780
What happened?

2293
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,960
I got attacked by a creature!

2294
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,120
The creature?

2295
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:12,960
Yeah.

2296
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,690
The cucuracha?

2297
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah, yeah!

2298
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,420
The cucuracha?

2299
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,500
The cucuracha?

2300
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,130
The cucuracha?

2301
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,150
The cucuracha?

2302
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:24,880
The cucuracha?

2303
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,100
The cucuracha?

2304
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,460
The cucuracha?

2305
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,700
The cucuracha?

2306
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,020
The cucuracha?

2307
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,920
I came to get this clown and I got attacked.

2308
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:33,700
Oh!

2309
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,500
Oh, be careful.

2310
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,160
Sorry.

2311
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,660
A ducky.

2312
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,180
Excuse me, duck.

2313
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,740
A ducky, ducky, ducky.

2314
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:45,730
Apart!

2315
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,980
Something up there?

2316
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,100
Nope.

2317
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,940
Why aren't you saying anything?

2318
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,210
Are you actually a kid, Aro?

2319
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,970
Uh-oh.

2320
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:06,370
Oh!

2321
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,510
Yes, I am.

2322
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:17,230
Oh, come on!

2323
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,310
Oh, why are y'all thinking I died too?

2324
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,450
The big, tall, dark, handsome?

2325
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:27,170
No, no.

2326
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,530
We died romantically from love together.

2327
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,250
We had a love explosion.

2328
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,530
Is Kowo even gonna find us?

2329
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:41,190
They're like in a corner under... Were you trying to freak me out, Kiara?

2330
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,370
Is this where we are?

2331
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,570
Uh, yeah, I was trying to freak you out indeed, actually.

2332
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,630
Well, it worked.

2333
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:49,770
I can't out-freak the freak of all freaks, can I?

2334
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,170
That is a different kind of freak.

2335
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:51,910
Oh!

2336
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:52,710
Oh!

2337
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,190
Oh!

2338
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,650
I didn't see.

2339
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:56,190
It's fine.

2340
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:56,430
Shit!

2341
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:57,950
No, we went so hard!

2342
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:02,550
Oh no, we went so hard again from level one.

2343
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,030
Yeah!

2344
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,030
Let's go!

2345
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,750
It's fine!

2346
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,350
Uh-oh, no.

2347
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,630
No, Texman, please, no!

2348
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:10,050
No!

2349
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:11,650
Oh, it's this again.

2350
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,110
Who will be the king of losers?

2351
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,200
Like, we win so big, and we lose so big.

2352
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,060
It's those guys.

2353
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,860
I'm scared, but I want a crown.

2354
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,450
Wait, there's a crown right there.

2355
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:29,670
Ugh!

2356
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:30,770
Oh!

2357
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:32,510
Oh!

2358
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:32,530
Uh!

2359
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,010
Uh!

2360
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:33,130
Uh!

2361
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,420
Uh!

2362
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:47,700
Stay!

2363
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,060
No, no, no, no.

2364
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,140
Uh!

2365
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:58,600
Uh!

2366
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,720
ï¿½ Resilton You're going on a lot.

2367
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,600
Good job, King of Losers.

2368
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,300
Thank you.

2369
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,500
King of Losers.

2370
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,480
Hope you're happy.

2371
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:23,880
I am.

2372
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,500
I'm feeling quite happy.

2373
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,180
My head is heavy.

2374
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,540
Hello?

2375
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,620
Hi.

2376
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:32,720
Hello?

2377
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:33,460
Hi.

2378
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,380
Let's go straight into it again.

2379
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,140
Yes.

2380
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:39,760
Okay.

2381
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,440
Yes.

2382
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,320
Okay.

2383
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,080
This is not even my sword.

2384
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,080
Oh, it's the new map!

2385
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,340
Museum.

2386
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,700
What is this?

2387
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,400
I haven't played this museum.

2388
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,620
Yeah, it just got updated today.

2389
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,300
That soon!

2390
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,640
Oh, it just got updated today.

2391
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,660
Yeah, I think.

2392
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,520
Wait, what am I stuck on?

2393
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,360
Big poop!

2394
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,600
Oh, I found Kobo's poop!

2395
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,660
You found Kobo's poop?

2396
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:15,980
Wait...

2397
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,080
Huh?

2398
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,810
Could you find the toilet?

2399
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:23,210
Sorry.

2400
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:24,690
Sorry.

2401
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:26,130
Wait, can somebody move the cart?

2402
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,170
I think we got it.

2403
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:29,090
I don't want to poke it against...

2404
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,650
Oh, oh, actually... Oh!

2405
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,270
Strong together!

2406
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:35,610
Wow, Kobo, your shit is so heavy!

2407
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,390
Sorry, oh my...

2408
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:40,470
Don't embarrass me like this, mom.

2409
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,970
Mom!

2410
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,690
Why would you put my shit there?

2411
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:44,790
It's such a struggle.

2412
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,930
Putting your shit all over the internet.

2413
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:48,970
It's my boyfriend!

2414
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,910
This is when I finally...

2415
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:52,790
What the hell is this?

2416
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,830
Fall into the alcohol consumption.

2417
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,450
You're a real mom now.

2418
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,010
Yeah.

2419
01:25:59,390 --> 01:25:59,570
Oh!

2420
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:00,150
Oh!

2421
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,570
Wait, it spilled!

2422
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:05,370
I drank it.

2423
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,970
I drank it.

2424
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:06,290
I drank it.

2425
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:06,650
Oh, okay.

2426
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:07,810
Are you drunk now?

2427
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:09,250
You drank the martini?

2428
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:10,110
Totally.

2429
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:11,810
Yeah, I drank the martini.

2430
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:13,150
Sorry.

2431
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:15,510
The museum is really cool.

2432
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,570
A little...

2433
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:17,630
Ugly.

2434
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:17,790
Yeah.

2435
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:21,810
Whoa, well, let's fly!

2436
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:24,650
It's like...

2437
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,130
Wait one second, you guys.

2438
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,070
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2439
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:28,410
Okay.

2440
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:31,850
Well, we already have so much fucking money!

2441
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,270
It's all thanks to Kobo's shit!

2442
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,190
It's crazy.

2443
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,130
You're welcome.

2444
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:39,270
Yeah.

2445
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:41,010
Is this a door?

2446
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:41,310
No.

2447
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:42,530
Your...

2448
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:44,590
Into the unknown!

2449
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,810
Into the unknown!

2450
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,250
Into the unknown!

2451
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,870
No, no, don't sing that!

2452
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:51,230
Don't sing that!

2453
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:51,630
Don't sing that!

2454
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:52,610
Oh, sorry.

2455
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,510
I mean, you can sing it on your channel, but...

2456
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,210
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2457
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:56,770
I forgot.

2458
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:57,470
I'm...

2459
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:58,750
I'm indie.

2460
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:01,410
Your...

2461
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,890
Your channel is like the...

2462
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:04,750
Western...

2463
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,150
Wild West of no rules.

2464
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:08,870
Wait, I just...

2465
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:09,130
Oh, no!

2466
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,830
Oh, no!

2467
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,270
No, no!

2468
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,190
No!

2469
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,410
You let it go!

2470
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,810
No!

2471
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:15,410
I did it!

2472
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,050
Does that...

2473
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,870
Does it have any money left on it?

2474
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,930
Shit.

2475
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,770
Kinda.

2476
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:23,950
Again.

2477
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:26,530
Oh, she's so hard.

2478
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,710
What is that?

2479
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:29,170
Wait, so...

2480
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:29,550
There's a thing!

2481
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:30,210
There's a thing!

2482
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,110
There's a guy!

2483
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,770
I don't know what it is.

2484
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,360
He's coming this way.

2485
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:22,060
He's coming this way.

2486
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,520
Does it react to sound?

2487
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,980
Boop, boop, boop, boop!

2488
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,100
All of the money.

2489
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,240
Let's just go.

2490
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,520
Yeah, I think we should just go back.

2491
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,940
I'll...

2492
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,300
I'll...

2493
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:02,660
I'll...

2494
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:02,680
I'll...

2495
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:02,720
I'll...

2496
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,680
Can't jump to you guys!

2497
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,340
Uh...

2498
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:06,740
What's it?

2499
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,000
Decides to turn around!

2500
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:08,780
Where'd it go?

2501
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,120
Okay.

2502
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,080
Hehehehe.

2503
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,200
Uh...

2504
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,440
I'm gonna sing my song.

2505
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,100
My little song of courage.

2506
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:25,180
I'm gonna sing my song, my song to get me back to the...

2507
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:25,760
Oh!

2508
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:53,340
I'm gonna sing my song, my song of courage.

2509
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:58,620
I'm going to sing my song, the song that gets me back home.

2510
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,250
My little van heres?

2511
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,290
My little...

2512
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,570
My little Xin!

2513
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,750
Oh, there's five of us.

2514
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,590
Where are you, bro?

2515
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:29,770
Why are you leaving us, bro?

2516
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,870
As long as it doesn't see us, we should be fine.

2517
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:33,630
Okay.

2518
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:38,930
It's death, so we should be fine if we talk.

2519
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:39,730
Yeah, yeah.

2520
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,830
It just freaks out when it sees you.

2521
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:42,670
Is Kiara dead?

2522
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:45,610
I don't know.

2523
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:49,150
Oh, Kiara is dead.

2524
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:52,310
Oh, look!

2525
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,570
There's a bunch of stuffs here!

2526
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:55,750
Yeah.

2527
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:58,550
Oh, should we... Yeah, let's take her head with us.

2528
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,210
This little hand of mine.

2529
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:04,210
Okay.

2530
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:09,570
This thing's ugly.

2531
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:14,750
Should we take Kiara's head or should we take the other thing right there?

2532
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:18,610
What do you think has more value?

2533
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,910
Oh, she...

2534
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:25,630
Need a hand?

2535
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,910
Oh, gosh.

2536
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,830
I thought you were the creature.

2537
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:32,990
La criatura.

2538
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:34,230
La criatura.

2539
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,280
Where is it?

2540
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:56,930
Be careful with the hand.

2541
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,910
I got the hand.

2542
01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,950
No pro...

2543
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:00,930
Wait, did I break the hand?

2544
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,550
No, but it did lose a little bit of value.

2545
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:05,110
It did?

2546
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:07,530
Oops.

2547
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:09,890
I'm like Kiara Senpai.

2548
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:11,270
Kiara Senpai's problem.

2549
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:15,690
Don't talk shit about her.

2550
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:17,610
I'm not talking shit.

2551
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,590
It's a compliment.

2552
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:21,090
We have the shit.

2553
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:23,990
Your shit.

2554
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:28,130
Oh, oh.

2555
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:29,330
Oh, we got her.

2556
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:29,850
We got her.

2557
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:31,250
Come on.

2558
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,290
Come on, Kiara.

2559
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:33,390
Right on top of the shit.

2560
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:33,910
Yeah.

2561
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,710
She's on top of her shit.

2562
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:36,310
Yeah.

2563
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:37,150
Yeah.

2564
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:37,690
Yeah.

2565
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,310
We haven't explored the hole.

2566
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:41,810
She's a little slippery.

2567
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,550
Oh, oh, oh.

2568
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:43,390
No, no, no, no, no.

2569
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:44,770
I grabbed it.

2570
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:44,970
You know what?

2571
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:45,710
I'll just...

2572
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:46,390
Sorry.

2573
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:47,630
I'll just put her here.

2574
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:49,430
Okay.

2575
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:52,510
I think we could probably...

2576
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:53,530
Just...

2577
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:54,870
Have her come back to life.

2578
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,010
Yeah, but...

2579
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:00,350
Then again, this is still the first round, so...

2580
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,670
And Koopa's still exploring.

2581
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,330
Oh, wait.

2582
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:02,990
No, not yet.

2583
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:03,450
Not yet.

2584
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:03,930
Oh.

2585
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,250
Just kidding.

2586
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:06,310
Just kidding.

2587
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,150
Just kidding.

2588
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:10,550
My bad.

2589
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:11,570
Koopa's not here.

2590
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,590
Yeah, it's fine.

2591
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:16,770
You're right.

2592
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,050
We're explore.

2593
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:22,670
Wait, Kiara finally died.

2594
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,600
He sounds so happy about it.

2595
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,000
It finally happened.

2596
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:35,720
Okay, nothing...

2597
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,640
Nothing else.

2598
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,160
We can go?

2599
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:39,620
We can go.

2600
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,000
We can go.

2601
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,000
We can go.

2602
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,380
We can go.

2603
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,780
We can go.

2604
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,380
We can go.

2605
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,520
We can go.

2606
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,340
We can go.

2607
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,440
Where's...

2608
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,380
Where's my mama?

2609
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,660
She's dead.

2610
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:07,580
Yeah.

2611
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:08,080
Oh.

2612
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,320
She'll be back in two seconds.

2613
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,040
Aight.

2614
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,060
Yar.

2615
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,080
She rebat...

2616
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:20,630
Rise to shine.

2617
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:24,450
Rise like a phoenix.

2618
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:30,630
Okay.

2619
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:31,850
Yeah.

2620
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,690
Good job, everybody.

2621
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:35,870
We got her.

2622
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:41,970
I actually died because I was trying to lead that scissor lady through the laser.

2623
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:42,610
Oh.

2624
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,130
But I did it a little bit...

2625
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,050
Wait, was that your weapon?

2626
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:49,950
There's a baby!

2627
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:57,750
Holly is afraid of children.

2628
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,230
There's a baby on the fucking truck!

2629
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:58,930
Huh?

2630
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,550
Yeah, that's a...

2631
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:04,470
It's all young, buddy.

2632
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,180
Baby.

2633
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,160
The baby.

2634
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,460
Yeah, she spotted a truck.

2635
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:13,400
Maybe it was just a shadow of Kobo.

2636
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,820
Because he's a baby?

2637
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:16,660
Yeah.

2638
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,740
Ain't no baby.

2639
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,560
The baby.

2640
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,360
That was a pretty big shadow.

2641
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,980
It's all young.

2642
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,540
It's all young.

2643
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,600
I'm a simple woman.

2644
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,460
All I want is a super woman.

2645
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,200
Give me power.

2646
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,020
Power.

2647
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,320
Stamina is okay, too.

2648
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,320
Nah, stamina is good.

2649
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,000
I'll take stamina.

2650
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,220
If you have a lot of stamina, it becomes stamina-mina.

2651
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:52,060
I like that one.

2652
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,520
Plus two, plus two.

2653
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,280
I'll take this.

2654
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,080
Explosive mine will be mine.

2655
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:03,200
Nice.

2656
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:04,960
Is that what you used before?

2657
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,060
Yeah.

2658
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:11,760
This time I will not activate it in the truck.

2659
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:13,700
Yeah.

2660
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,160
Okay.

2661
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,100
Nice.

2662
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,120
Anything else?

2663
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:19,380
But I mean, should we use up?

2664
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,340
There's still crouch rest range.

2665
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,720
There's still a health upgrade.

2666
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,460
Yo, somebody can have that.

2667
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,560
I'll put it in.

2668
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:25,600
Yeah.

2669
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,280
Okay.

2670
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,460
Let's get it.

2671
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:30,640
Let's go.

2672
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,320
Let's go.

2673
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,340
Let's go.

2674
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,920
I think we can do another world in that time.

2675
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,280
Yeah.

2676
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,040
We're so good.

2677
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,780
Wait, how do I... Until the fire dance, was it called?

2678
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:45,980
Yeah!

2679
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,700
Hear me!

2680
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:48,840
Fire dance.

2681
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:49,560
Fire.

2682
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,420
Fire dance.

2683
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,220
Fire, fire.

2684
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,640
Fire, fire.

2685
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,180
Don't get fire.

2686
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,220
Don't get fire.

2687
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,480
Don't get fire.

2688
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,160
Which one did I grab?

2689
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,160
Stamina.

2690
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,620
So, I press E and then I place it.

2691
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:07,960
Yes.

2692
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:09,680
Yeah.

2693
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,220
You could test it again here if you want.

2694
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,260
No.

2695
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,480
No need for testing.

2696
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,080
Testing has been successfully...

2697
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,600
But never mind.

2698
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,800
I don't want the...

2699
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,440
I don't want the strength anymore.

2700
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,040
Can I get the stamina?

2701
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:30,400
Get the stamina.

2702
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,660
Get the stamina.

2703
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,720
Get the stamina.

2704
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:45,920
Get the stamina.

2705
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,180
It's here.

2706
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:47,180
Ooh.

2707
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,040
Okay, okay.

2708
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2709
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,420
I think we need help.

2710
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,980
We might need help.

2711
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,280
Oh, be careful, be careful.

2712
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:54,520
No.

2713
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,900
I have strength upgrade.

2714
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,580
Let me carry this alone.

2715
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:58,540
Oh.

2716
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,580
We'll still help you.

2717
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,820
We still need help.

2718
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:03,060
Still need help.

2719
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,860
All righty.

2720
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,340
All righty.

2721
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,760
Yo, you're 11,000 already.

2722
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,940
Oop, oop, oop.

2723
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,520
Nice.

2724
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,680
Bring it down to the corner.

2725
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:13,540
Yes.

2726
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:14,640
Yeah, yeah.

2727
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,100
That's pretty cool.

2728
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,210
It was right next to the door.

2729
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,430
Someone said it's summons enemies.

2730
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,350
What's happening?

2731
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,970
Really?

2732
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,130
Yeah.

2733
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,950
I don't know what that means, though.

2734
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,210
Mysterious.

2735
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:42,570
Boy, a bedroom.

2736
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:45,890
Is this open?

2737
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:53,090
An ocarina.

2738
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:07,080
Am I going the right way?

2739
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,400
Okay.

2740
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,340
Guys, the jet lag is starting to hit a little bit.

2741
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,840
Where's the crate?

2742
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:22,560
I don't know.

2743
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:23,600
I'm looking for it, too.

2744
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,920
It's not in there.

2745
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:30,620
Oh, here it is.

2746
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,060
Here it is.

2747
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:35,740
Easy.

2748
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:40,780
Okay.

2749
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,220
I'm yip-y.

2750
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:44,640
I'm yip-y.

2751
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:46,600
There's a secret diary.

2752
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,380
What's it say?

2753
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,180
What's it say?

2754
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:58,000
I can break it.

2755
01:39:59,140 --> 01:39:59,980
Uh oh.

2756
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:00,920
Please don't.

2757
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,600
I hear creepy sounds.

2758
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,280
Me too.

2759
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,920
Wonder what that means.

2760
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:07,320
I'm in trouble.

2761
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:12,650
It's a secret.

2762
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:15,210
There are no secrets here.

2763
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,370
Uh.

2764
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:22,090
Huh.

2765
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:26,010
What Minto time now?

2766
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:28,210
10 p.m.

2767
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,070
And I went to bed last night.

2768
01:40:32,210 --> 01:40:33,090
At 8.

2769
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:40,010
At 8 p.m.

2770
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:08,710
And I almost walked out.

2771
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,610
Right into him.

2772
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:15,330
Is that him or is that the doorway?

2773
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:15,990
I can't.

2774
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:19,150
I can't really tell.

2775
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:19,150
I can't really tell.

2776
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:19,150
I can't really tell.

2777
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:24,370
I can't really tell.

2778
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:25,830
Oh, Groose.

2779
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:28,570
Hey, Groose.

2780
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:29,770
Eww.

2781
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:32,790
Kiara, contain yourself.

2782
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,530
It's the martini.

2783
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:36,310
I was gonna say.

2784
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,610
You have a problem.

2785
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,610
You have a drinking problem.

2786
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:43,310
I don't have a problem.

2787
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:46,050
It's just, you know, it's never drank before.

2788
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,070
And so it has a crazy effect on me.

2789
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:50,710
Okay.

2790
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:51,730
Intense.

2791
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:54,610
There's a lot of, uh, treasures here.

2792
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:54,950
Wow.

2793
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:55,790
Yeah.

2794
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,110
Easy.

2795
01:41:58,770 --> 01:41:59,110
Oop.

2796
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,270
There we go.

2797
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:00,650
Uh.

2798
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:01,510
Uh.

2799
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:02,010
Uh.

2800
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:03,350
Uh.

2801
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:06,290
Why are you squinting like that?

2802
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,150
You have a hangover?

2803
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:09,050
Uh.

2804
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:13,470
I don't trust, um, this place anymore.

2805
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,770
I'm, I'm careful.

2806
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:16,470
She's careful.

2807
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:21,190
Cause we saw, we already, me and Ollie already saw the big monster that, with the grabby hands.

2808
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2809
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:22,930
I saw him too.

2810
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:23,590
I saw him too.

2811
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,410
18,000 girlies.

2812
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:33,810
Oh, I found the second, uh, the second.

2813
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:34,630
Extractor?

2814
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:34,990
Yup.

2815
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:35,510
Yup.

2816
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:37,310
Okay.

2817
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,070
Please remember the area.

2818
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,170
For us.

2819
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:41,030
I remember.

2820
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,370
Okay.

2821
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:45,650
Wait, they just don't open?

2822
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:46,030
Okay.

2823
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,410
Happy birthday!

2824
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:58,090
Sorry, I missed it.

2825
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,090
Yeah?

2826
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,460
What do you need?

2827
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,560
This thing.

2828
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:09,980
Oh, the big boy, okay.

2829
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:11,280
Yeah.

2830
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,000
Also, is it someone's birthday?

2831
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,820
Yeah, someone in my chat.

2832
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,700
Happy birthday!

2833
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,260
Does he do the same stuff?

2834
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,320
Ah, nice, nice, nice and snug.

2835
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,620
Nice and snug.

2836
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:28,290
Nice.

2837
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,980
And I think it's like, really cool.

2838
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,720
Oh, oh, okay.

2839
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,420
Yeah?

2840
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:36,780
Nice.

2841
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,320
Nice?

2842
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,400
I think I can carry it alone.

2843
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:03,820
Thanks.

2844
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:04,560
Okay.

2845
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:06,580
She's strong.

2846
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:07,980
She's an independent woman.

2847
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,700
Where are you going?

2848
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:12,800
I think it's behind you.

2849
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,020
Oh, I think?

2850
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:14,860
The...

2851
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:15,340
What's behind me?

2852
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:17,240
Yeah, the car, I think, is behind you.

2853
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,640
Oh, right here, right here.

2854
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,160
I'm coming.

2855
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:21,200
Oh, okay.

2856
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:21,900
Nice, nice, nice.

2857
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:23,100
Oh.

2858
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,020
Where's...

2859
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,160
Oh, sorry.

2860
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:28,460
It was still screaming.

2861
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:29,820
Oh, no!

2862
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,220
What?

2863
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:34,980
Something big broke.

2864
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,260
Something big broke?

2865
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,440
Was it a minster?

2866
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,080
Oh, my God!

2867
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,320
Okay.

2868
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,900
Where's the other stuff?

2869
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,960
This place is huge.

2870
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,180
Where are we?

2871
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:05,680
Oh, I went into a circle.

2872
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:05,820
Oh.

2873
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:06,980
Oh, another!

2874
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:14,390
I think we can go here to the extractor.

2875
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:15,370
Easy.

2876
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:21,450
Yeah, it's right here.

2877
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,210
Nice.

2878
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:28,630
Oh.

2879
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:32,670
Hi.

2880
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:33,370
Hello.

2881
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:35,790
Follow me, my lady.

2882
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:36,830
It's right here.

2883
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:39,730
Follow me, my lady.

2884
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:40,230
Yeah.

2885
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:44,110
I feel like I'm going grocery shopping with my mom.

2886
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:45,370
I'm pushing the cart.

2887
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:49,090
Probably just six minutes until premiere!

2888
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:50,610
Oh, my God!

2889
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:54,030
Okay, let's get this done and then let's go to the shop.

2890
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:54,970
Yeah, baby.

2891
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:55,670
Yay!

2892
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:59,570
Also, six minutes plus probably waiting room time.

2893
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:00,750
True.

2894
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:02,790
Countdown.

2895
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:03,970
YouTube countdown.

2896
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:06,970
Damn.

2897
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:07,990
Damn, we're loaded.

2898
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,610
Okay, I know where the next point is, too.

2899
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:13,250
Yeah!

2900
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:14,730
Min found it!

2901
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:16,090
I found it.

2902
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:16,610
Wait.

2903
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:17,630
Uh...

2904
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,350
Yeah, I know.

2905
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:19,510
I know.

2906
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,430
I remember.

2907
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:27,890
Uh, don't come in here!

2908
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,950
Uh, Grabby Man is in here.

2909
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:35,090
Wait, why Columbia?

2910
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:37,450
Oh, there he is.

2911
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:37,830
There he is.

2912
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:38,210
There he is.

2913
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:38,870
Cause...

2914
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:41,210
And there's a pretty statue.

2915
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:43,010
Are you statue?

2916
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:45,410
Where is...

2917
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:46,130
Grabby Man?

2918
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:47,330
Uh, he's gone.

2919
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:47,770
You're good.

2920
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,670
Oh, no, he's not.

2921
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,490
He's still here.

2922
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:58,610
Is that the sound of death?

2923
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:00,310
Oh, wait.

2924
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:00,610
Oh.

2925
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:01,410
Oh, shoot.

2926
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:04,470
Wait.

2927
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:07,330
Is it active?

2928
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:09,050
I don't think so.

2929
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,990
Oh, now it's active.

2930
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:10,850
Okay, now it's active.

2931
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:11,630
But wait.

2932
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,190
It will go...

2933
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:13,950
Oh, there it goes.

2934
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,230
Wait, no.

2935
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:15,810
Okay, so now we need to lead the guy into it.

2936
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:16,890
We need to lead him into it.

2937
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:17,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2938
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,850
But where is he?

2939
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,470
Uh, he just went to the right.

2940
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:23,210
Cobo was...

2941
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:25,610
Okay, let's hope he comes over here.

2942
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:26,790
Oh, there's a spitter!

2943
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:29,710
No.

2944
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:30,630
No.

2945
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:31,790
No.

2946
01:47:32,830 --> 01:47:33,130
No.

2947
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:33,610
No!

2948
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:34,690
Cobo cameo, cobo cameo, wait, wait!

2949
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:36,470
Okay.

2950
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:40,310
She just walked past it like a boss.

2951
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:41,750
Wow.

2952
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,210
That didn't even react.

2953
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:46,870
Okay.

2954
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:47,810
Avoid.

2955
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,830
For now.

2956
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:51,570
Uh, I think it was...

2957
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:52,450
This way.

2958
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:54,630
Oh, yeah!

2959
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:55,570
And then...

2960
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:56,750
North from here.

2961
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,030
And then in here, in here.

2962
01:47:58,750 --> 01:47:59,750
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2963
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:00,170
Here we go.

2964
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:03,950
Okay, let's...

2965
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:04,850
Prepare to run!

2966
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:05,530
Now!

2967
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:06,310
Run now!

2968
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:07,330
Right!

2969
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,130
Run now!

2970
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:12,320
Run!

2971
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,300
We're so slow.

2972
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:13,800
We walk.

2973
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,520
Run, run, run!

2974
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,780
Run before the monsters!

2975
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:18,600
No!

2976
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:18,980
Careful, careful!

2977
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,060
Careful, though!

2978
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:20,980
Yes.

2979
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:21,720
There's a mine!

2980
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,080
Okay.

2981
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,300
Damn, I will never see it.

2982
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,660
Behind you, behind you.

2983
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,720
Oh, I'm lost.

2984
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:31,260
Wait, no!

2985
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:31,640
No!

2986
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,050
Wait, it's...

2987
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,390
This is the way.

2988
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:38,170
Oh, I've come by totally right past it.

2989
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:41,990
Phew.

2990
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,110
Now, where's Kiara-senpai?

2991
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:50,450
Um...

2992
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:52,330
It's a good question.

2993
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:52,750
I think...

2994
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,410
I think she...

2995
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:54,490
I think she just died.

2996
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,150
Okay, I'll take one for the team.

2997
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:58,430
Are you sure?

2998
01:48:58,690 --> 01:48:59,430
Good luck!

2999
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:06,500
Kiara!

3000
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,600
Kiara!

3001
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:08,180
Kiara!

3002
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:09,800
Kiara!

3003
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:10,540
Kiara!

3004
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:10,760
I...

3005
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,040
I...

3006
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,160
I...

3007
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,540
I...

3008
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:11,700
I...

3009
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:12,060
I...

3010
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:12,080
I...

3011
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,040
I...

3012
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:13,260
I...

3013
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:13,440
I...

3014
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:13,640
I...

3015
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,880
Did I sound funny when I said explode?

3016
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:28,340
Yeah!

3017
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,290
I wanted to see him in...

3018
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:34,030
40 day!

3019
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:35,310
They were all here!

3020
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:35,910
They were...

3021
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:36,150
40 day!

3022
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,170
Oh my gosh, Warhammer!

3023
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:40,870
Right now, we gotta get ready.

3024
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,410
We gotta get ready for the...

3025
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,090
Premiere!

3026
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:44,350
The premiere!

3027
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:44,570
Okay!

3028
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:45,170
Well...

3029
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:47,730
You girls can like shop a little bit.

3030
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:48,950
Still...

3031
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:49,770
It's all chill.

3032
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:50,910
It's all chill.

3033
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,550
It's all chill.

3034
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:53,670
Okay...

3035
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:54,470
Little...

3036
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:55,450
Health...

3037
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:56,230
Healing...

3038
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:56,710
Stamina!

3039
01:49:58,490 --> 01:49:59,530
But yeah...

3040
01:49:59,530 --> 01:49:59,670
Um...

3041
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:00,850
People in my chat...

3042
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:01,770
I linked...

3043
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:02,650
The premiere...

3044
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:03,130
I think...

3045
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,870
In the pinned comment...

3046
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,310
So...

3047
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:06,170
Otherwise...

3048
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,230
Just make your way...

3049
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:08,670
To Reyna's...

3050
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:09,310
Uh...

3051
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:10,030
Channel...

3052
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:10,710
There's a sword?

3053
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,630
It will be there...

3054
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:13,370
Oh yeah...

3055
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:14,630
While you do that...

3056
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:15,170
I'm gonna...

3057
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:16,170
Go to the bathroom real quick.

3058
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:18,110
Okay...

3059
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:20,350
She's really going to the toilet this time.

3060
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:22,230
I'm really going to the toilet.

3061
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:23,990
Don't do immersion!

3062
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:26,070
Don't you care about immersion?

3063
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:27,630
Where is the toilet?

3064
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:29,730
Oh yeah...

3065
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,210
Uh...

3066
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:31,530
Is there no toilet in here?

3067
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:32,690
Ah...

3068
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:33,730
The one time...

3069
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:36,150
The one time...

3070
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:36,970
We need a toilet...

3071
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:37,450
It's not here...

3072
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:38,830
The one time...

3073
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:38,930
What?

3074
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:39,550
Shall I be?

3075
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:41,850
Okay...

3076
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:42,210
I'll be our way...

3077
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:43,690
Let me just keep opening my...

3078
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:47,950
Oh wait...

3079
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:50,170
I did the wrong one...

3080
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:50,910
That would've been so bad...

3081
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:53,670
Okay...

3082
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,730
I'll be right back...

3083
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:56,790
The...

3084
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,240
Bro...

3085
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:04,960
Yo...

3086
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,620
What are we buying?

3087
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,520
I'm buying...

3088
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:08,760
I'm buying...

3089
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,300
Are you the pocket card?

3090
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:12,380
Drank...

3091
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:13,760
A pocket cardage?

3092
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,360
Pocket card...

3093
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,240
Like you can have it in your pocket...

3094
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,260
Oh, a pocket card!

3095
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:18,260
I want...

3096
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:19,740
Yeah!

3097
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,580
Cute, but we don't need it...

3098
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:24,640
Mmm...

3099
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,240
Mmm...

3100
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:25,460
Mmm...

3101
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:25,760
Oof...

3102
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,560
Exciting...

3103
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,580
Premiere will begin shortly...

3104
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:29,500
Yeah!

3105
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:31,400
It'll be still good too!

3106
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,800
Trust me...

3107
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:35,040
Sprint speed...

3108
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,200
Yeah!

3109
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,500
I want sprint speed...

3110
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,520
There we go...

3111
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,560
Let me give you guys the link here...

3112
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,580
Thank you for the support...

3113
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:45,640
Start...

3114
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,000
Yeah!

3115
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,320
Raina...

3116
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:48,680
And Anya...

3117
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:49,980
And Watame...

3118
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:50,640
And me...

3119
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:51,780
Are singing in it...

3120
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,400
What's the unit name?

3121
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:53,660
Stop happening!

3122
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,840
Wait, is there no...

3123
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:56,480
A waiting room?

3124
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,440
What?

3125
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:57,860
What?

3126
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,160
Is it actually...

3127
01:51:59,160 --> 01:51:59,640
There is!

3128
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:01,940
I mean, like...

3129
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:02,200
No...

3130
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:02,840
Yeah, okay...

3131
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,800
Premiere will begin shortly, it says...

3132
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,020
Oh yeah!

3133
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:05,560
Two minutes!

3134
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,000
Two minutes!

3135
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:06,340
Woo!

3136
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,930
It won't start...

3137
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,070
My people...

3138
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,930
Are watching...

3139
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:18,090
Two!

3140
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:22,030
IKIMASHO!

3141
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:23,950
IKIMASHO!

3142
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,070
But...

3143
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:26,170
I guess I should...

3144
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:26,730
Mute it...

3145
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:28,090
So that my viewers can...

3146
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:29,270
Won't hear it...

3147
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:29,970
Double...

3148
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:30,610
Mmm...

3149
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:31,930
I'm gonna mute myself...

3150
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,970
Gonna mute yourself?

3151
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:34,410
Okay!

3152
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:36,110
Yeah, so that when...

3153
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:37,150
When the time comes...

3154
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:38,030
I can watch it...

3155
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:39,010
Okay!

3156
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,810
If you're using your phone...

3157
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:47,950
And you can't watch it now...

3158
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:48,890
Just, um...

3159
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:50,910
Watch it after the stream...

3160
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:52,690
That's fine too...

3161
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:52,970
Yeah!

3162
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:57,730
Yeah...

3163
01:52:57,730 --> 01:53:00,430
I heard that Raine put a lot of effort into it...

3164
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,730
Yeah, oh my god...

3165
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,310
She sounds so cool in it...

3166
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,190
By the way...

3167
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:04,830
She's...

3168
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:05,430
Killing it...

3169
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:07,910
So curious...

3170
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:09,590
The video is really sick too...

3171
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,930
I'm glad she invited me...

3172
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:14,390
Yeah!

3173
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:16,590
I was so happy when she invited me...

3174
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:18,790
Yeah!

3175
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,210
I was so happy when she invited me...

3176
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:20,650
Yeah!

3177
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:24,550
She always chooses the best songs too...

3178
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:27,450
Wait, I...

3179
01:53:27,450 --> 01:53:29,330
Oli, you're reacting to what I'm saying right?

3180
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:31,310
You're not just talking on your own...

3181
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:31,530
Yeah!

3182
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,290
I am, I am!

3183
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:33,010
Oh, okay!

3184
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:36,650
Oh my god!

3185
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:37,190
26!

3186
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:37,750
25!

3187
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:38,490
24!

3188
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:39,370
23!

3189
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:42,950
I think I'm a little bit behind...

3190
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:43,810
Oh no...

3191
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,250
This is...

3192
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,370
This won't do...

3193
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:46,870
Oh...

3194
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:47,710
Speeds...

3195
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:48,490
Up...

3196
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:49,590
Times two...

3197
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:51,310
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

3198
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,890
Here we go...

3199
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:55,310
Eight...

3200
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:55,930
Seven...

3201
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:56,870
Six...

3202
01:53:59,010 --> 01:53:59,450
Zero!

3203
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:01,070
Two...

3204
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:01,430
What?

3205
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,020
I wanna hear it...

3206
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,500
Man...

3207
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,440
Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine...

3208
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:13,840
Wake up!

3209
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:14,140
Get up!

3210
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:14,500
Stand up!

3211
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,220
Wake up!

3212
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:15,540
Get up!

3213
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:17,240
I'm just reading the subtitles...

3214
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,320
But God, the moon takes a little bit of yoga...

3215
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:25,300
Hmm...

3216
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:25,780
Hmm...

3217
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,000
Hmm...

3218
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,320
Wait!

3219
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:28,600
Oooh...

3220
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:29,240
Eaaah!

3221
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:30,680
What-a-me!

3222
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,140
Anya...

3223
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:37,900
No, that's me...

3224
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:38,640
No, no, no it's Anya.

3225
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,140
No, it's me...

3226
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:40,300
Ha!

3227
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:41,400
Yeah!

3228
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:41,560
Yeah.

3229
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,320
Wow, this is real fire.

3230
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:45,720
Hell yeah.

3231
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,320
Hellfire.

3232
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,160
Hellfire.

3233
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,920
I think that's a different song.

3234
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:54,580
Wow.

3235
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:55,660
Wow.

3236
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:01,270
Chorus.

3237
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,040
Oh, this part was difficult.

3238
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,860
It sounds difficult.

3239
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,360
Wow.

3240
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,120
It doesn't fit together.

3241
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:28,770
Wow.

3242
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,030
Wow.

3243
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:36,510
Instrumental break.

3244
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:37,790
Wow.

3245
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:42,670
Yo.

3246
01:55:47,230 --> 01:55:47,690
Oh.

3247
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:51,310
Live reaction.

3248
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:51,750
Oh yeah.

3249
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:53,650
I like this.

3250
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:54,410
K.O.

3251
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:55,350
Pew pew pew.

3252
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:55,830
Pew pew pew.

3253
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:56,370
Pew pew pew.

3254
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:57,550
K.O.

3255
01:55:57,810 --> 01:55:58,270
Oh,

3256
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,500
you look good in leather pants.

3257
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:06,860
Oh, thank you.

3258
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:09,520
You would look good in leather pants too.

3259
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:10,920
Whoa.

3260
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,000
And you know what?

3261
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,340
I think we'd look good kissing each other too.

3262
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,320
Mmm, I suppose so.

3263
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:20,820
Sorry.

3264
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,300
Let's, let's fine.

3265
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,400
Focus, focus.

3266
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,480
Wow.

3267
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:30,080
Wow.

3268
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,120
Good boy.

3269
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:33,620
Minda, are you watching this shit?

3270
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,880
I'm, I'm pulling it up right now.

3271
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:37,920
You're fucking late!

3272
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:39,920
I'm sorry!

3273
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:41,920
It's okay.

3274
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:57,450
Such a funny word combination.

3275
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:01,940
Yeah, yeah.

3276
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:04,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3277
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,540
Stay tight.

3278
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,840
Yeah, but not burn out!

3279
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,540
This is so funny.

3280
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,380
It's so funny.

3281
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:15,920
Whoa!

3282
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,280
Arigato gozaimasu!

3283
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:26,300
Yay!

3284
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:27,160
Amazing.

3285
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:28,840
Thank you.

3286
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,020
Amazing.

3287
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:30,800
Amazing.

3288
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,360
That was really amazing.

3289
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:33,860
Thank you for listening.

3290
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,240
Thank you for taking the time.

3291
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:36,160
Amazing.

3292
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,180
Amazing.

3293
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,800
Let's continue a little bit longer.

3294
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,980
And then I will go to Waynes after talk.

3295
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,220
Green afterwards.

3296
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:47,420
Yeah.

3297
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:50,180
Alright, do we have everything we want to buy?

3298
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:51,700
Yep.

3299
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,260
I think so, yeah.

3300
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,980
I think I took, um...

3301
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,460
What did I take?

3302
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,080
I took a little heal.

3303
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,980
And the sprint speed...

3304
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:03,220
Sprint?

3305
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,120
Speed upgrade.

3306
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:06,360
Yeah, I took the sprint too.

3307
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:07,620
Okay.

3308
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:09,920
I took the stamina.

3309
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,740
You want to add something?

3310
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,800
I added something.

3311
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:14,560
I added something already.

3312
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:14,920
Okay.

3313
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:16,600
Yeah.

3314
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:18,260
Burn

3315
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:21,980
out.

3316
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:23,700
Burn out.

3317
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,240
Burn out.

3318
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:26,280
Beep boop bop, burnout.

3319
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:27,760
Burn out.

3320
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,640
Yup, yup.

3321
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,560
And... going!

3322
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:35,700
Let's go.

3323
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:38,400
Let's go.

3324
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:38,900
Let's go.

3325
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,380
Oh,

3326
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,120
did somebody take the mine?

3327
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:49,660
Did I take the mine?

3328
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,440
What's wrong with you?

3329
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,980
I don't think I saw mine.

3330
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,000
Stamina?

3331
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,860
Where's the jumpy?

3332
01:58:58,300 --> 01:58:59,200
Oh, the sprint's deep.

3333
01:58:59,440 --> 01:58:59,700
There we go.

3334
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:02,580
Oh?

3335
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,840
Did I buy the mine again?

3336
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,000
Did I sleep by it?

3337
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:08,580
Maybe... maybe still you kept it because you didn't use it.

3338
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:08,880
Maybe.

3339
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,220
Oh!

3340
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:11,700
Of course!

3341
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:12,860
Maybe.

3342
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,780
I'm going to get that guy this time.

3343
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:15,840
That's my theory.

3344
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,320
My game theory.

3345
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,780
Thanks for watching.

3346
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:21,520
Thanks for watching.

3347
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,920
Geng, gang, gang, gang, gang.

3348
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,980
Geng, gang, gang, gang.

3349
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,520
Gnarly.

3350
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:34,820
This stream is gnarly.

3351
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:39,760
Oh, we're in recession tonight.

3352
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,340
Oh, we're going out tonight.

3353
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,260
Gang, gang.

3354
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:43,240
Oh, my God.

3355
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:44,120
Congratulations.

3356
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,300
Thank you.

3357
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:48,140
Is it real?

3358
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:49,820
Is it real?

3359
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,500
Is it real?

3360
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:53,720
I must see.

3361
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:57,810
Oh, wow.

3362
01:59:58,010 --> 02:00:01,390
There's a really big ATM machine over here, guys.

3363
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:04,210
Wait, this is a thing you can take?

3364
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,990
Yeah.

3365
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:07,050
Oh, it's heavy.

3366
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,550
It's so heavy, guys.

3367
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:10,590
Where's the stronghold?

3368
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:11,390
It's big money.

3369
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:17,410
I thought it was a slidey door for some reason.

3370
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:20,410
Guys...

3371
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:21,390
Gnarly.

3372
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:22,510
Oh, shit.

3373
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:23,890
Very gnarly.

3374
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:24,970
Gnarly.

3375
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:26,790
Gnarly.

3376
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:28,910
Combine our strengths.

3377
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:32,650
But it's 22,000 though.

3378
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:33,670
Easy.

3379
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,930
Is it okay?

3380
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:35,990
Yeah.

3381
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:36,450
Oh.

3382
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:38,730
Does it automatically activate it?

3383
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:39,790
Just put it here then.

3384
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:42,090
Let's put it in the second round then, or...

3385
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:43,830
No, right at the end then.

3386
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:44,610
We'll put it in...

3387
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:44,850
Oh.

3388
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:45,530
Oh.

3389
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:47,450
It's fine.

3390
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:49,350
Gang, gang.

3391
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:54,950
You can put it just right here, and then once we find the second one...

3392
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:55,770
We could...

3393
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:56,590
Have it ready.

3394
02:00:56,910 --> 02:00:58,390
Yeah, hopefully we're fast enough.

3395
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:00,570
This way.

3396
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,090
Let's go.

3397
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:01,690
Gang, gang.

3398
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,790
Gang, gang.

3399
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:03,610
It's gonna be really...

3400
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:04,410
Finicky.

3401
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,350
Gnarly.

3402
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,610
Gnarly.

3403
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:08,750
You two girls already hear Gabriela?

3404
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:10,850
Not yet!

3405
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:11,770
What's that?

3406
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:12,750
And now...

3407
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:15,270
They already released the next from Game Boy.

3408
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:16,350
Really?

3409
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:18,050
What was that?

3410
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:20,190
I heard a monster.

3411
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:20,910
Me too.

3412
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,370
I think it was...

3413
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:25,110
The pervert.

3414
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,570
It's the laser monster.

3415
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:27,610
The...

3416
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:27,790
Oh.

3417
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:32,600
Where do you see it?

3418
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,720
I heard him.

3419
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,200
Isn't that the stalking pervert?

3420
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,640
The one that like...

3421
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,300
Drags you around?

3422
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,960
I don't know what you're talking about, bro.

3423
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:44,580
I'm not...

3424
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:46,060
I'm not crazy, right guys?

3425
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:48,380
Oh.

3426
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,020
Dang, dang.

3427
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:53,230
Gang, gang.

3428
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:56,290
Okay.

3429
02:01:56,450 --> 02:01:56,970
I put...

3430
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,410
A bomb...

3431
02:01:58,410 --> 02:01:58,630
Down.

3432
02:01:59,470 --> 02:02:00,050
Okay.

3433
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:04,170
I feel like he wants this guy.

3434
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:15,130
Oh!

3435
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:17,090
Torina's a kidnapper guy.

3436
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:17,750
Yeah!

3437
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3438
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:19,930
It's a pervert.

3439
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,450
Crazy.

3440
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:22,850
I was so shocked.

3441
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,270
I was so scared.

3442
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:25,170
And there was also...

3443
02:02:25,170 --> 02:02:29,630
Are you still watching Moose Fighting Volume 2, Antler Mania?

3444
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:30,170
Okay!

3445
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,950
When you find a monster, leave him here.

3446
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:36,850
Guys...

3447
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:42,460
Uh...

3448
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:43,640
Wait...

3449
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,080
Did I hear a yoink?

3450
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:46,240
Yup.

3451
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:48,860
They say...

3452
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,360
Come here!

3453
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:50,460
You coward!

3454
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,120
I got yoinked, but I'm still here.

3455
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:53,880
Why...

3456
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,580
Why won't he come here?

3457
02:02:59,040 --> 02:02:59,480
I'm...

3458
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,320
I'm not sure.

3459
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,440
Okay, if you do a dancing voice...

3460
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,900
I don't like that show.

3461
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:05,200
Okay!

3462
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:08,620
What's up?

3463
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:11,440
Don't watch Antler Mania!

3464
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:13,740
Don't watch Ant...

3465
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,180
Antler Mania?

3466
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:18,800
If somebody asks you, do you wanna watch Antler Mania?

3467
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:19,860
Turn...

3468
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:21,680
The other way.

3469
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,300
Antler Mania?

3470
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:24,820
Yeah!

3471
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,600
Are you getting ready for the toilet time again, or what?

3472
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,060
No, I'm just...

3473
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:31,900
I'm doing my horror game...

3474
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,180
Little ritual...

3475
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:33,680
Where you're...

3476
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,540
You're...

3477
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,920
Yearning for the toilet.

3478
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:37,780
You just got...

3479
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:39,240
Some people yearn for the minds...

3480
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,700
But you...

3481
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:41,640
Are different.

3482
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:43,420
Maybe I really am a toilet ghost.

3483
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:44,080
I don't know.

3484
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:45,520
Did my mind go up?

3485
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,280
Y-

3486
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:51,480
S...

3487
02:03:58,920 --> 02:03:59,880
I don't know...

3488
02:03:59,880 --> 02:03:59,980
You're...

3489
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:00,420
Oh, you're working outside.

3490
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,000
Yeah...

3491
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,880
Kiara!

3492
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:05,180
You still alive!

3493
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:05,300
You still alive?

3494
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,180
Yeah, I'm alive.

3495
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:12,020
Here, let me heal you.

3496
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,380
Toire no...

3497
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:13,000
Toire no...

3498
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:14,020
Huh?

3499
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,090
You aren't alive.

3500
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,870
You are alive!

3501
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:22,750
How do I heal you?

3502
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:23,230
Yeah!

3503
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:25,490
Oh, I felt hurt.

3504
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,110
You touched her name.

3505
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:26,710
Please.

3506
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:27,910
Please heal me.

3507
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:28,310
Come here.

3508
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:29,770
Do you touch me?

3509
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:30,830
Just once or twice?

3510
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:33,310
Let me touch you too.

3511
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:34,750
Did you touch me?

3512
02:04:35,370 --> 02:04:36,910
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch.

3513
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:37,310
Ooh.

3514
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:41,770
Okay, that's enough.

3515
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:42,130
That's enough.

3516
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:43,010
Okay.

3517
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:45,410
I don't want to take everything from you.

3518
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:46,890
The healing side.

3519
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,290
The mine worked!

3520
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:48,270
The mine worked.

3521
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:49,450
It didn't work.

3522
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,490
Did anybody catch it on 4K?

3523
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:52,490
Yeah, I did!

3524
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:54,570
I saw you get grabbed afterwards.

3525
02:04:58,750 --> 02:04:59,410
That's old.

3526
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:01,470
I've got to check Ollie's archive afterwards.

3527
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:06,750
Oh, there's a... There's a... There's a... Grandma's ashes right here, if you want to...

3528
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:08,930
Kiwawa.

3529
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:10,050
Kiwawa the strong.

3530
02:05:11,290 --> 02:05:12,350
You must take it.

3531
02:05:12,430 --> 02:05:17,130
It doesn't... One does not have to be strong to take the ashes.

3532
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,250
I thought you do.

3533
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:19,870
No.

3534
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:28,630
It was going so well.

3535
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,010
It's fine, girlies.

3536
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:34,990
I don't know what she was panicking about.

3537
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:36,630
I just...

3538
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:40,170
Her panicking made me panic.

3539
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:44,990
Okay, we don't need that much money.

3540
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:48,110
A gas tank.

3541
02:05:50,730 --> 02:05:51,810
Bombs away.

3542
02:05:52,850 --> 02:05:53,910
Bombs away.

3543
02:05:55,650 --> 02:05:56,570
A laptop.

3544
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:00,470
What's that music for?

3545
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:01,210
Wait, what's this?

3546
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:05,050
Wait, something... Something big lit up.

3547
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:09,350
Something big lit up, but I don't know what it is.

3548
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:12,230
That sounds scary.

3549
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:12,950
What the heck?

3550
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:15,790
It's in here.

3551
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:16,530
It's in here.

3552
02:06:20,070 --> 02:06:20,690
This thing.

3553
02:06:21,710 --> 02:06:22,410
Oh, it's a PC!

3554
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:23,130
We're stacking.

3555
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:26,770
How do we... How do we... How do we bring it?

3556
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:29,350
Uh, maybe we take it to the second extractor?

3557
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:30,870
Yeah.

3558
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:31,310
Yeah.

3559
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:31,730
Yeah.

3560
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:31,730
Yeah.

3561
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:33,110
Let's extract this first!

3562
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:34,070
Yeah!

3563
02:06:34,570 --> 02:06:34,690
Yeah!

3564
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:35,150
Yeah!

3565
02:06:35,870 --> 02:06:35,870
Yeah!

3566
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:41,380
Did they leave?

3567
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:43,480
I will find the second extractor.

3568
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:45,320
That will be my duty.

3569
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,280
Unless I die trying.

3570
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,680
I think it's in here.

3571
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:55,910
Is that it?

3572
02:06:56,170 --> 02:06:57,270
Is that the red box?

3573
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:01,390
Locked.

3574
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:07,210
I keep hearing things.

3575
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:09,550
I can't tell if it's like outside noises or...

3576
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:11,470
Oh!

3577
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:13,010
I found it!

3578
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:17,750
I did find it.

3579
02:07:18,370 --> 02:07:19,950
I told you it would be in here.

3580
02:07:23,650 --> 02:07:26,130
You think I could take the PC by myself?

3581
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:33,020
Like, it sounds like...

3582
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,380
Car sounds, you know?

3583
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:37,820
I'm hungry, you guys.

3584
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,140
I got a thing from...

3585
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:40,720
I got...

3586
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,140
Eggie and...

3587
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:44,060
Some tomatoes from the Konbini.

3588
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,040
And I'm gonna eat them right up after this.

3589
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:49,260
I don't like the new YouTube.

3590
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,940
Why is everybody at names instead?

3591
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,240
I can't recognize you guys.

3592
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,140
Some of you guys have...

3593
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:00,000
Some of you guys have similar names as usual, but some of you don't.

3594
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,240
I don't recognize you.

3595
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:04,940
It's weird.

3596
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:05,380
Why...

3597
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,240
But it's the same as the comments.

3598
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,420
So it was always like inconsistent, you know?

3599
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:13,940
Oh, I got yoinked.

3600
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:18,500
Yoink.

3601
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:20,940
Oh my god.

3602
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:21,660
Oh!

3603
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:24,960
I'm getting attacked by the pervert!

3604
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:27,220
The pervert's here.

3605
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,000
He's grabbing me.

3606
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:28,480
Oh.

3607
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:29,840
And he is...

3608
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:31,140
Grabbing me.

3609
02:08:38,430 --> 02:08:39,530
Where is everybody?

3610
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:48,500
I'm waiting for them.

3611
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:50,860
Who are you people?

3612
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,080
Oh my god.

3613
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:58,460
Please, pervert.

3614
02:08:58,580 --> 02:08:58,700
No.

3615
02:08:58,940 --> 02:08:59,100
No!

3616
02:08:59,260 --> 02:08:59,660
God damn it!

3617
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:00,080
No!

3618
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:00,600
No!

3619
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:01,080
Pervert!

3620
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,280
Thank you!

3621
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:18,360
That's how it is.

3622
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:23,100
We were getting scammed while you were getting kidnapped.

3623
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:24,840
Wait, why were you scammed?

3624
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:25,340
Oh!

3625
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:25,620
Oh!

3626
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:25,620
Help!

3627
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,440
It's a kidnapper!

3628
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,120
It's a kidnapper!

3629
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:39,280
Come on, come on.

3630
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:41,620
Come on, I know where to go.

3631
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:42,460
I know where to go.

3632
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,240
He should be arrested.

3633
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:48,860
I think all the insides of our cart were not counted.

3634
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:49,840
What?

3635
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:55,440
It was a bit of stressful situation, because we had to move in the big, like, PC...

3636
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,640
Whatever that was... No, no, no, no!

3637
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:58,680
No!

3638
02:09:59,320 --> 02:09:59,460
No!

3639
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:00,160
No!

3640
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:00,880
Kiwawa!

3641
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,160
I'm coming after you, Mish!

3642
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:06,360
It's the pervert!

3643
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:08,740
Mish!

3644
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,860
Oh no!

3645
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,240
No, stop it!

3646
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,340
Are you okay?

3647
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:17,040
I'm a little traumatized.

3648
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,940
It's like the fifth time the pervert has gotten me.

3649
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,040
Damn, Ki really likes you.

3650
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:23,960
I...

3651
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:27,680
It's my sexy ghost body!

3652
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,740
For real.

3653
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,360
Oh wait, it's this way.

3654
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:31,880
Gnarly.

3655
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,920
Gnarly.

3656
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,680
This way, this way.

3657
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,160
Oh, is that all of them?

3658
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,220
Then we can take this, right?

3659
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:42,760
PC, let's go PC together.

3660
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:43,620
Yishony PC.

3661
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:44,940
Yishony PC.

3662
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,460
Yishony PC.

3663
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,580
Yishony PC.

3664
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:49,100
Yishony.

3665
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:52,580
Yishony.

3666
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:54,840
One, two, three.

3667
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:55,000
One, two, three.

3668
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:57,820
Where did you leave all of you?

3669
02:10:58,860 --> 02:10:59,240
Okay.

3670
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:00,340
We got this.

3671
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:00,640
Okay.

3672
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:02,460
It's a little crooked though.

3673
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:03,940
Wait, it's gonna fall!

3674
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,020
Uh...

3675
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:09,480
Uh...

3676
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,140
Uh...

3677
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:10,880
Uh...

3678
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,160
Okay, okay, it's okay, it's okay.

3679
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:13,780
Just keep it laid down.

3680
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3681
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:15,320
Okay.

3682
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:16,700
That's good, that's good.

3683
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:17,620
That's good.

3684
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:19,300
Oh, but it will have to go upstairs.

3685
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:21,140
Oh, lift, lift, lift, lift.

3686
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:21,540
Okay.

3687
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:22,920
Lift, lift.

3688
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:25,540
Wait, I'm stuck on something.

3689
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:26,040
There we go.

3690
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:29,420
Oh.

3691
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,240
It's okay, it's okay.

3692
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:32,840
Yeah.

3693
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,460
It's looking fine.

3694
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,000
Okay, turn.

3695
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:37,680
Ooh!

3696
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:40,440
Turn, turn.

3697
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:41,040
Oh, this is tricky.

3698
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:42,320
Tetris.

3699
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:45,040
We're okay.

3700
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:47,320
We're okay.

3701
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:48,280
We're okay.

3702
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:49,340
Good, good, good.

3703
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:50,660
How do we get it up the stairs?

3704
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:51,000
It's okay!

3705
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:53,060
Oh.

3706
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,320
Should we help her?

3707
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:58,780
Hold on, hold on.

3708
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,560
We're almost there.

3709
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,260
We're almost there.

3710
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:01,200
We'll help her later.

3711
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,440
Just fine, just fine.

3712
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:04,760
Do you die at the end of getting kidnapped?

3713
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:05,700
Or does he just like...

3714
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,000
No, he just drops you.

3715
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:07,860
He just drops you.

3716
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:08,600
He just drops you.

3717
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:09,520
Oh, okay.

3718
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:10,140
She's fine.

3719
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:12,780
Okay, almost there.

3720
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:13,580
Almost there.

3721
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:14,780
Almost there.

3722
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:22,440
Wow, how are you so small?

3723
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:24,060
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3724
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:25,480
I don't know.

3725
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:27,600
Okay, and now...

3726
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:28,880
Maybe the cart goes in first.

3727
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:34,000
Because the cart is not the full value of the...

3728
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
What we need.

3729
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:36,220
Oh, 2,000.

3730
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:37,860
Okay.

3731
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:39,520
That was pretty big.

3732
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:40,340
But now...

3733
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,440
We need to make it stand again.

3734
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:43,900
Otherwise, it's gonna cut off...

3735
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,240
When the...

3736
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:45,940
Does it do that?

3737
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:47,620
Yeah.

3738
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,540
It'll cut off?

3739
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:51,360
Yeah.

3740
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:53,300
So...

3741
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:53,840
Eh.

3742
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:55,000
Like that, maybe.

3743
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:57,360
Okay.

3744
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:59,140
So I have good news.

3745
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:00,440
Oh, no.

3746
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,300
It just crashed.

3747
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,280
Because otherwise, we wouldn't have completed it.

3748
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:14,700
Uh, should we run?

3749
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:15,880
Yeah, we gotta go.

3750
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:17,200
What was the good news?

3751
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:20,200
So the good news is that the stalker...

3752
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:24,050
What's the clown do?

3753
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:26,150
The laser.

3754
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:27,130
Oh.

3755
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:28,630
I was the stalker dead.

3756
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:29,630
How did you kill him?

3757
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:29,850
Oh.

3758
02:13:31,390 --> 02:13:31,930
So...

3759
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,140
Damn.

3760
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:38,880
Oh.

3761
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:39,880
Come on!

3762
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:42,540
Oh, I didn't know he could...

3763
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:42,960
No!

3764
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:44,620
Okay.

3765
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:45,360
No boat!

3766
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:45,580
No boat!

3767
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:46,680
No boat!

3768
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:47,000
No

3769
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:57,300
boat!

3770
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,320
We watched a triple queue!

3771
02:13:59,280 --> 02:13:59,760
Yeah...

3772
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:00,860
Yeah...

3773
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:08,600
He got, he was such a bad hallway to be in.

3774
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:09,940
Again.

3775
02:14:09,940 --> 02:14:10,700
They're real.

3776
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:11,680
Oh my gosh.

3777
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:13,740
They're in so big, and they lose so big.

3778
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:17,380
That's kind of...

3779
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:17,400
Bad.

3780
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,700
Oh, shoot me.

3781
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:51,520
What is that?

3782
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:52,780
Oh, it's a chainsaw.

3783
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:53,040
Oh.

3784
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,980
She's so good at being a loser.

3785
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:01,160
That is the name.

3786
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:04,820
Loser.

3787
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,980
Loser still loser.

3788
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,440
The loser cry.

3789
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,140
Loser.

3790
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:14,680
Loser.

3791
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:16,500
Loser.

3792
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:17,560
Loser.

3793
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:19,120
Loser.

3794
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,280
Loser.

3795
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:20,680
Loser.

3796
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:21,540
Loser.

3797
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:24,900
Look how sad she looks.

3798
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:29,020
Sad loser, baby.

3799
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:30,120
Loser.

3800
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:36,820
Oh, she forgot.

3801
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:40,400
She doesn't even know how to lose.

3802
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:42,780
Hey, she's playing with our dead bodies.

3803
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:46,760
Oh.

3804
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,140
Are you actually making us kiss?

3805
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,280
Yeah, kiss.

3806
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:51,520
Yeah, this is kissing.

3807
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,700
Oh.

3808
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:56,640
King of the losers.

3809
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:58,760
Loser.

3810
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:00,980
Loser.

3811
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:01,580
Loser.

3812
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:01,980
Loser.

3813
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:02,640
Loser.

3814
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:05,340
Loser.

3815
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,060
Wow.

3816
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:13,200
Wow.

3817
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:14,920
Honestly, I'm pretty satisfied.

3818
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:15,860
I don't know about you.

3819
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,860
Yeah, it was a good run.

3820
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:18,560
It was.

3821
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:18,820
Nice.

3822
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:19,840
Yeah.

3823
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:20,740
Was it a good run?

3824
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:22,220
We died.

3825
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,520
But we got so many stuff.

3826
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:26,080
We even got the PC.

3827
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,720
We carried the PC upstairs.

3828
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:29,400
Yeah.

3829
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:30,120
It was crazy.

3830
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:31,160
Crazy.

3831
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,280
I mean, we died, but it wasn't our fault.

3832
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:33,780
No.

3833
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:34,760
Never.

3834
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,200
That could never be our fault.

3835
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:37,800
Yarr.

3836
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:39,140
Yarr.

3837
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,040
Whose fault was it then?

3838
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,960
The stalker.

3839
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:44,520
Yeah.

3840
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:45,760
The stalker.

3841
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,380
The stalker.

3842
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:46,860
I agree.

3843
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,820
Can't agree more.

3844
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:52,580
Good job, everybody.

3845
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:53,420
Yeah.

3846
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,840
Good job, everybody.

3847
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:56,960
You're such hard workers.

3848
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:58,340
I can't believe it.

3849
02:16:58,340 --> 02:17:06,040
I'm so blessed to work with... To have colleagues who are so committed and so disciplined.

3850
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:11,320
But I guess that doesn't count in Mint because she isn't my co-worker colleague.

3851
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:11,820
No.

3852
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:13,620
No.

3853
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:27,960
What?

3854
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:32,720
I feel like we kept getting a lot of the same enemies.

3855
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:34,740
Is it because we weren't going to higher levels?

3856
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:39,000
But the stalker I saw for the first time.

3857
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:39,880
Yeah.

3858
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:40,900
That's crazy.

3859
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:46,600
And today I also saw that like...

3860
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:50,880
Studio Ghibli monster for the first time also.

3861
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:53,520
Studio Ghibli monster for the first time.

3862
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:54,500
The grabbing hand one?

3863
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,240
The grab-a-grau?

3864
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:57,780
The Ghibli monster.

3865
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:59,460
The Ghibli monster.

3866
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:00,700
Kawonashi.

3867
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:02,260
Kawonashi.

3868
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:02,740
Kawonashi.

3869
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:02,820
Kawonashi.

3870
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,100
I wonder if they were inspired from him.

3871
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:08,160
Freaky.

3872
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:08,960
It looks like him.

3873
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:09,860
Yeah.

3874
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:11,380
It does, isn't it?

3875
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:13,420
Speaking of freaky...

3876
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,500
We dumped our freaky ghost into the toilet many times.

3877
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,400
I need a shower.

3878
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:19,940
Bad.

3879
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:21,040
Desperate.

3880
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:24,360
You know who needs a shower more is Kubo.

3881
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,820
I wiped her ass.

3882
02:18:26,820 --> 02:18:28,180
No, she needs a bidet.

3883
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:34,780
What are you typing?

3884
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:36,780
Me?

3885
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,200
Yeah.

3886
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:43,060
Keep going, keep going.

3887
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:46,820
Oh, so good.

3888
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:48,660
Really

3889
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:54,340
good.

3890
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:03,850
Congratulations.

3891
02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:05,670
Gang.

3892
02:19:06,130 --> 02:19:06,870
Gang, gang, gang.

3893
02:19:08,550 --> 02:19:08,650
Gang.

3894
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:09,930
Gnarly.

3895
02:19:19,010 --> 02:19:22,790
I love how we're just finishing and waiting until she finished, I mean.

3896
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:26,250
Okay.

3897
02:19:27,130 --> 02:19:27,630
Congratulations.

3898
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:34,050
Oh, B, I think?

3899
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:45,480
I thought you did it on purpose so you could just type in the chat.

3900
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,460
forward in but...

3901
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:53,760
do it on PC.

3902
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:55,280
Uh-oh.

3903
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:03,140
, that's possible.

3904
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:03,960
Everything's okay?

3905
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:06,200
Huh?

3906
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:07,620
And...

3907
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:08,380
Thanks!

3908
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:08,920
Oh.

3909
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:11,960
Hotty, hotty.

3910
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:13,320
Hotty.

3911
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:15,520
Hotty, hotty.

3912
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:18,260
No, no, no.

3913
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:20,240
We must still like a bag of Takis.

3914
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:24,840
Hotty, hotty.

3915
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,700
I'm gonna do it myself.

3916
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:33,120
What did you say, Mint?

3917
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:33,880
What did you say?

3918
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:35,280
Gimme them Takis.

3919
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:37,400
That's wrong.

3920
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,440
Hotty, hotty.

3921
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:41,280
Gimme them Takis.

3922
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,780
Take a shit.

3923
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:44,460
Take a shit.

3924
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:47,100
Take a shit.

3925
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:49,420
That's what I'm doing!

3926
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:55,700
I'm a shit.

3927
02:21:03,060 --> 02:21:03,840
I'm a shit.

3928
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3929
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:10,560
You're ruining the song.

3930
02:21:20,300 --> 02:21:21,240
Who am I missing?

3931
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:23,300
Topi-a!

3932
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:24,460
They're gonna be so disappointed.

3933
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:29,020
Nah, they're my best friend.

3934
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:29,540
Cat's tie.

3935
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:30,480
I know Cat's tie.

3936
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,000
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3937
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:33,700
Yeah.

3938
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:35,500
My aunt...

3939
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:39,260
I could describe everything with one single word.

3940
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,280
You know?

3941
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,560
Bobate.

3942
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:43,700
Gnarly.

3943
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:45,200
Tessa.

3944
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,380
Gnarly.

3945
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:47,840
Magical.

3946
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:48,740
Gnarly.

3947
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,620
Part in the whole world with you.

3948
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,600
The song.

3949
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:54,720
Gnarly.

3950
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:56,560
Oh my god, the new bitch.

3951
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:57,760
Oh my god.

3952
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,300
Is this even real?

3953
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:03,920
Gang, gang.

3954
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:09,480
All of you, the real of my man.

3955
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:13,270
Yeah.

3956
02:22:14,770 --> 02:22:15,890
Gnarly, that thing.

3957
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:17,850
Oh yeah, the fear is walking Gnarly.

3958
02:22:18,470 --> 02:22:20,410
We should do the song cover.

3959
02:22:21,130 --> 02:22:21,810
That would be...

3960
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:23,170
Be...

3961
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:23,310
Gnarly.

3962
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:25,070
That would be Gnarly.

3963
02:22:25,330 --> 02:22:26,270
Oh, Gnarly.

3964
02:22:27,050 --> 02:22:29,650
Oh my god, Wayne is in my chat.

3965
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:31,610
Gnarly.

3966
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:33,850
I wanna ha...

3967
02:22:33,850 --> 02:22:34,470
Oh gosh.

3968
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:35,350
Gnarly.

3969
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:43,590
I want to join our Gnarly gang.

3970
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:45,790
Gnarly.

3971
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:49,050
This conversation is making my stream die.

3972
02:22:51,010 --> 02:22:51,390
Oh no.

3973
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:52,990
Gnarly.

3974
02:23:08,750 --> 02:23:09,630
Gnarly.

3975
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:10,430
Gnarly.

3976
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:12,010
Gnarly.

3977
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:12,250
Gnarly.

3978
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,930
Any final words?

3979
02:23:14,430 --> 02:23:15,090
Um...

3980
02:23:15,090 --> 02:23:15,670
Olivia.

3981
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:17,010
Olivia!

3982
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:19,650
She's who?

3983
02:23:20,290 --> 02:23:22,550
It's more of a gnarly name.

3984
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:24,410
I'm not even referencing Olivia.

3985
02:23:24,410 --> 02:23:26,370
Yeah, I'm more referencing like Gabriela.

3986
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,510
And then combining that with Ollie.

3987
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:29,310
Gabriela.

3988
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:30,490
Ohhhh!

3989
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:31,910
That's what you're talking about.

3990
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:32,910
What the hell?

3991
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:34,410
Olivia's not here.

3992
02:23:36,950 --> 02:23:40,730
Oh, I do have an announcement if that's okay.

3993
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:42,470
Oh my god, please.

3994
02:23:42,470 --> 02:23:43,730
Yeah, please.

3995
02:23:44,210 --> 02:23:44,410
Yeah, please.

3996
02:23:44,410 --> 02:23:45,590
Yeah, it's just nonsense.

3997
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:55,110
Okay, so everybody, um, the world tour is going to be happening super, super soon.

3998
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:59,310
It's going to be happening in Sydney, the first one, on the 12th of July!

3999
02:24:00,130 --> 02:24:01,030
Yeah, girl.

4000
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:02,350
You got it, girl.

4001
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:03,370
Yeah.

4002
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:05,210
It's going to be...

4003
02:24:05,210 --> 02:24:05,330
Yeah, yeah.

4004
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:05,830
It's going to be...

4005
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:06,010
Let's gooooon.

4006
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:09,030
Let's gooooon.

4007
02:24:10,650 --> 02:24:11,210
Gnarly.

4008
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:12,330
Gnarly.

4009
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:14,810
And then we're going to have another one this month also.

4010
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:17,270
Oh, not this month, but like on July also.

4011
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:19,070
We'll be doing it in Hong Kong.

4012
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:20,530
So see you guys then.

4013
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:22,210
Wooooooh.

4014
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:23,530
Yippee!

4015
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,870
That's very...

4016
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:25,210
Uh-huh.

4017
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,190
Good luck, Ollie.

4018
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:32,790
Have fun.

4019
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:34,610
Yeah, that's all for me.

4020
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:35,090
Thank you.

4021
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:35,790
Yay!

4022
02:24:36,390 --> 02:24:36,730
Okay.

4023
02:24:38,390 --> 02:24:38,890
Yay!

4024
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:39,010
Yay!

4025
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:39,910
Yay!

4026
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:44,010
Kubo, do you want to say something?

4027
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:46,050
I'm good.

4028
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:48,310
Gang, gang.

4029
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:48,990
Gang, gang.

4030
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:55,130
Kubo, I'm so happy that I could play with you again.

4031
02:24:55,130 --> 02:24:56,270
I missed you.

4032
02:24:56,990 --> 02:24:57,570
Heh.

4033
02:24:58,350 --> 02:24:58,750
Heh.

4034
02:24:59,470 --> 02:24:59,670
Heh.

4035
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,050
Heh.

4036
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:01,890
Well, that's...

4037
02:25:01,890 --> 02:25:02,050
Yeah.

4038
02:25:02,430 --> 02:25:02,930
Gang, gang.

4039
02:25:03,130 --> 02:25:04,310
Miss you too, gang-gan.

4040
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,890
Gang, gang!

4041
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:05,210
Yeah!

4042
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:06,730
We the gang.

4043
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:10,070
Thank you for inviting me, Takaki-chan one.

4044
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:10,510
Then...

4045
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:12,570
Mwah, you're welcome, Takaki-chan.

4046
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,080
Is she cute?

4047
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:21,680
She's so cute.

4048
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:22,960
She's got it from me.

4049
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:25,300
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

4050
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:27,020
She's got your eyes.

4051
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,140
The angle doesn't fall far from the tree, you know.

4052
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:31,440
Thank you.

4053
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:34,340
For the good things.

4054
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:35,460
Me too.

4055
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:36,460
Oh, you're welcome.

4056
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,000
Me too.

4057
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:38,160
Uh-huh.

4058
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,360
Um...

4059
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:41,940
Uh...

4060
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:42,220
You...

4061
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:42,780
You...

4062
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:43,500
You got...

4063
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:44,480
You got something to say?

4064
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:50,440
I'm glad that I could collab with Oli and Kubo for the first time.

4065
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:52,680
You're so fun!

4066
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:53,320
Yeah!

4067
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,580
And I love...

4068
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:55,360
Kirawa.

4069
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:59,040
Gang, gang.

4070
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:00,980
It's nice.

4071
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:01,780
Gang, gang.

4072
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:03,960
It's nice that we're mingling a little bit here.

4073
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:04,360
Yeah.

4074
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:05,560
Uh...

4075
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:07,480
From Takanashi Kirawa...

4076
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:08,360
Uh...

4077
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:09,620
I have an announcement.

4078
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:19,460
On Sunday, I have the second part of my Marathon Karaoke that goes all the way to 1.6 million.

4079
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,900
We're not that far away from it anymore.

4080
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:25,040
And I freaking forgot to put up the subscriber count again.

4081
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:25,680
Oopsie.

4082
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:27,080
Yeah.

4083
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:27,740
What are you at?

4084
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,320
What are you at?

4085
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:28,700
That's fine.

4086
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:37,200
I'm like 1,800 subs or so away probably from 1.6 million.

4087
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:38,180
Wood voices.

4088
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:39,040
And...

4089
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:39,120
Yeah.

4090
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:39,540
Whoa!

4091
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:42,740
It's about time to reach a new milestone.

4092
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:43,860
That's a big number.

4093
02:26:44,180 --> 02:26:44,520
Oh, a milestone.

4094
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:45,740
So it's a marathon.

4095
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:47,320
Yeah, a big milestone!

4096
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,200
And...

4097
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,640
And after...

4098
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:50,680
Or during...

4099
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:53,640
At the end of the marathon, there will be a big announcement.

4100
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:57,080
And perhaps that will stand up so you can see my ass.

4101
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:07,820
It will be something to achieve and something nice for everybody to look at though.

4102
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,400
Oh, the full moon that day everybody.

4103
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:13,540
Full moon.

4104
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,960
Invest in Wawa coin.

4105
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:19,740
Kiwawa's ass to the moon!

4106
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:21,260
Yeah!

4107
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:22,240
And it's free!

4108
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:23,720
You only have to subscribe.

4109
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:27,260
Subscribe is free.

4110
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:27,380
It's free.

4111
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,900
What if you get to 1.6 before Sunday?

4112
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:32,760
That will be...

4113
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:34,560
Will you start standing up?

4114
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,520
Uh...

4115
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:38,700
I think I will just do a celebration karaoke instead.

4116
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,040
But honestly, that would be too good to be true.

4117
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,220
I don't believe it.

4118
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:46,960
But then you can see my butt from the start of the karaoke on Sunday.

4119
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:50,060
That sounds like a way to me!

4120
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:53,340
Yeah, it would be good if it doesn't take too long.

4121
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:56,860
Because I realized I have to go to the dentist early on Monday.

4122
02:27:57,080 --> 02:27:59,020
So if the stream goes too long, I'm a little bit fucked.

02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4155
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:51,800
Okay.

Okay, I'm fading back out.
