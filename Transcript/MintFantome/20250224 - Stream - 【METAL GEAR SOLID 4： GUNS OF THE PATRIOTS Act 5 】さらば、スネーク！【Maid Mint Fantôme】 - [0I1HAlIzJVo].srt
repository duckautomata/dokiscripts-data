1
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,800
Welcome to the final act of Metal Gear Solid 4.

2
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,700
The final act with our beloved Solid Old Snake.

3
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,600
The last time I get to play as him... in his story.

4
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,580
Yeah, watch Long Incoming, true.

5
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,840
So true, so true.

6
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,060
I don't want it to switch to the... what's it called?

7
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,180
The commercials.

8
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,500
Keep listening to Old Snake theme.

9
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:50,060
There will be a lot of cutscenes today, so if you are not prepared...

10
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,480
Maybe, depending on how we're feeling, before some of them we'll do like a brief potty break.

11
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,860
And then get into it.

12
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,100
We're prepared to cry, we're prepared to cry!

13
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,360
Yeah, a bit of an intermission.

14
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,460
Thanks for getting me hooked on MGS Boss so hype!

15
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm still not ready though.

16
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm still not ready.

17
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,060
I ate my snack during intermissions.

18
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,660
I have my popcorn.

19
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,740
I got a new... I went to the store earlier to get popcorn.

20
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,560
I got a new popcorn.

21
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,900
Never gotten it before.

22
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,520
Because popcorn I usually get was like so expensive.

23
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,580
Even on sale, it was like $5.

24
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
I was like, I don't remember it being this expensive.

25
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,620
And I got the store brand one for $1.50.

26
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,120
Let's test it.

27
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,620
Let's see how it tastes.

28
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,100
Let's see how it tastes.

29
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
I got kettle corn.

30
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,300
What flavor is kettle corn?

31
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,520
Kettle corn.

32
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,360
Alright.

33
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,420
Let's see if it has a good crunch.

34
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,140
It's like not sweet at all.

35
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,700
Hold on, maybe that was a bad one.

36
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,980
Okay, okay, it's pretty good.

37
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,760
Okay, it's pretty good.

38
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,280
Yeah, it's pretty good.

39
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,540
Yeah, it tastes pretty good.

40
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,060
Worth saving the money.

41
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,020
She said the thing.

42
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
I should be going to bed now.

43
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,980
So I'm not a zombie, I work tomorrow, but I'm making a stream.

44
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,240
No!

45
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,020
Salkind, this is going to be a very long stream.

46
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,960
You should go to sleep, or you could go to sleep while watching.

47
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,100
Go to sleep.

48
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,880
And last time we did some spirit photography.

49
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,060
Look, we exercised these.

50
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,460
There was a ghost here, and it's gone now.

51
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,180
And there was a ghost here.

52
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,780
Oh, there's still a ghost here.

53
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,040
There is a ghost here.

54
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,940
It's gone now.

55
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,300
There's a ghost here.

56
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,340
It's funny, my controller does like a tiny little vibration.

57
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,640
And then we took some sexy photos.

58
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,540
Oh yeah.

59
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,740
Awesome.

60
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,660
Why do I sound like that?

61
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,220
You're too invested.

62
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,160
And exit.

63
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,180
Look at that.

64
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,540
Oh yeah.

65
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,940
She looks cold.

66
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
She looks too cold.

67
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,820
Oh gosh, that's a spooky ghost.

68
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,640
Just like me.

69
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Sounds like Lay Your Love On Me by ABBA.

70
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
Oh, it kind of does.

71
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,340
It is.

72
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,820
Wait.

73
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,120
What part does it sound like?

74
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,260
I hear it.

75
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
Goodbye Baker.

76
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,480
Death by IBS.

77
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,260
Wait, is this?

78
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,640
Oh, that's Baker too.

79
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,940
No place for Hideo.

80
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,800
Okay, I'm not going to do all of them.

81
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,700
Does exercising the ghost do anything?

82
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,360
I think you get DP from it.

83
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,080
No?

84
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,060
Or you get DP when you... I can't remember.

85
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,260
When you take the picture.

86
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,800
I can't remember.

87
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,000
Rudy, thank you for 10 months!

88
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,660
What's the policy on birthday songs this stream?

89
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,880
Asking with zero pressure.

90
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,040
Rusa!

91
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
That's a great question actually.

92
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,420
I think I will sing birthday songs.

93
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
Up until...

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
Maybe Microwave Halloway.

95
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,160
What if we exercise all the ghosts?

96
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,420
Once you have to end the stream and go...

97
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:35,840
Outside!

98
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,180
Yeah,

99
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,120
I think the real turning point is...

100
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,900
The feeling of the game...

101
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,440
Happens at the hallway.

102
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,160
So I think...

103
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,280
I think up until then.

104
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,740
That's when the real tonal shift...

105
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,360
I mean, there's already been a tonal shift.

106
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,260
But you know what I mean.

107
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,620
But anyway, I can sing happy birthday for you right now!

108
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,120
Happy birthday to you!

109
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,500
Happy birthday to you!

110
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,860
Happy birthday dear Rusa!

111
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,500
Happy birthday to you!

112
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,600
Happy birthday!

113
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,740
And also, maybe probably during some...

114
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,780
Cutscenes, you know.

115
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,560
Depending.

116
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,900
Great question though.

117
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,770
If you do have a birthday...

118
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,630
And you would like for me to sing it...

119
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,240
Did you change the PS3 clock back to...

120
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,880
I didn't!

121
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,200
I

122
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,260
didn't change it back!

123
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,020
Quit the game.

124
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
David, you saved me.

125
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,460
Oh my gosh!

126
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,100
We have it set to Monday.

127
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Oh my gosh!

128
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh my gosh!

129
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,800
Let me see.

130
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,680
Date and time setting.

131
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,130
Wait.

132
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,490
It says 23rd.

133
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,990
Maybe I did set it back.

134
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,520
I just don't remember.

135
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,060
I guess I did do it.

136
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,800
I must have done it directly after stream.

137
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,820
And completely forgot.

138
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,320
Funny.

139
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,700
Yeah,

140
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,360
exactly!

141
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,560
That's what we're talking about.

142
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,320
On Sundays and...

143
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
Not Mondays.

144
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,640
Sundays and Wednesdays.

145
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,680
Okay.

146
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,240
Cool.

147
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,700
When did I change it back?

148
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,320
My PS3 is haunted.

149
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,530
The darker color and the eyepatch go well together.

150
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,430
Yeah!

151
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,790
Thank you!

152
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,990
I thought that it kind of like...

153
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,950
Gives like a sneaking suit sort of vibe.

154
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,130
An AI did it.

155
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,610
Oh my gosh, the Patriots.

156
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,950
Sasuga, the Patriots!

157
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,350
Sheesh.

158
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,090
Oh gosh.

159
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,250
I'm...

160
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,870
Nervous.

161
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,190
But...

162
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,930
We'll just get into it, because...

163
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,870
Not so much talking, so we can just...

164
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,530
Like I said, it'll be quite a...

165
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,630
Quite a longer stream.

166
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,070
Today, we should be able to get...

167
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,070
The...

168
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,170
I will try to get the sorrow doll.

169
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,410
Since I don't have that.

170
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,950
Of the mantis doll.

171
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,870
But...

172
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,320
We can get the...

173
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,410
The gun!

174
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,450
Ready for the final act of MGS4...

175
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,910
In the world record part of the game!

176
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,110
I actually got real leftover movie popcorn.

177
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,670
You got this, Mint.

178
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,630
Thanks, Chikaido!

179
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:39,750
Chikaido!

180
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,410
I can never remember how to do that fight.

181
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,310
You know, I watched a fight...

182
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,490
Thing last week, and I can't remember either.

183
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,510
So much has happened this week for me...

184
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,050
That my brain is...

185
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,190
A little jumbled.

186
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,450
But I do remember there's one...

187
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,090
Way to cheese...

188
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,510
Part of the fight that happens before.

189
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,290
But I think I'll just do it properly.

190
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,710
I probably won't go with...

191
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,450
Very many cheeses.

192
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,650
Because...

193
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,330
I know also...

194
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,510
Before I talked about farming...

195
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,290
Or drubbing points.

196
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,830
Because there's a place in here...

197
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,430
That you can.

198
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,950
But obviously...

199
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,990
I just want to get through the game.

200
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,130
And...

201
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,310
And...

202
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:35,930
So...

203
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,450
No cheese, zero lactose.

204
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,070
I'm feeling...

205
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,990
Lactose intolerance.

206
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,590
There is.

207
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,710
Can you show it at least?

208
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,310
What, the cheese for the fight?

209
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,490
It's not the fight for Mantis.

210
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,830
That's not a spoiler, obviously.

211
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,550
We know that we have to fight...

212
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,770
The last boss babe beauty.

213
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,770
Beast.

214
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,630
Boss beast.

215
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,170
Beauty beast.

216
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,010
But there's a little fight before it.

217
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,750
Basically I can kind of explain it.

218
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,990
So there is a bunch of...

219
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,630
There's like several rounds of...

220
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,010
Froggies.

221
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,550
Froggy girls that come in.

222
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,990
But on the first round of the froggies...

223
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,330
You...

224
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,910
You get it down to one last frog.

225
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,910
And then you basically just kind of...

226
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,150
Keep her in a...

227
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,390
Stun grenade loop.

228
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,530
And...

229
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,570
Eventually...

230
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,910
It like, I don't remember...

231
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,030
I don't remember if it's like a...

232
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,770
If you...

233
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,830
Run out of time?

234
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,330
Like if the game automatically moves on?

235
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,330
Or if you have to do something.

236
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,590
That's why I'm not going to attempt it because I don't quite remember.

237
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,110
But you...

238
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:52,650
Um...

239
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,190
Eventually the game is just like...

240
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,430
Okay, you spent enough time with the frogs.

241
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,410
Time for the next fight.

242
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,050
And you...

243
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,670
Can skip the whole other rounds.

244
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,910
Of the...

245
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,690
Of it, so yeah.

246
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,830
Sorry, I'm not good at explaining things.

247
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,670
I'm not good at explaining things.

248
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,210
Another birthday!

249
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,390
Happy MGS Sunday Minto!

250
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,050
Yesterday was my golden birthday.

251
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,430
What's a golden birthday?

252
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,330
So maybe I get a special MGS happy birthday.

253
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,550
Happy lads, Minky.

254
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,090
Let's finish the snake journey.

255
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,850
BOLD NOODLE!

256
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,130
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

257
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,190
WAIT, ANOTHER BIRTHDAY!

258
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,990
Twelve!

259
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,850
What do you mean you were too shy?

260
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,170
What do you mean you were too shy?

261
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,090
Can I give her the pink by the way?

262
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,030
What's a golden birthday?

263
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,340
Golden birthday is when you're the same age as the day.

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,640
You get a special shower that day.

265
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,270
So I would have been ten...

266
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,250
No, ten.

267
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,210
Sorry, that's the month.

268
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,010
Wait, I died.

269
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,750
So if I was dead for one year, then that would have been my golden death day.

270
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,850
I was basically...

271
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,890
Like, I was basically...

272
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,210
Like, just a speck of light.

273
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,130
What the hell?

274
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,550
So I couldn't even get to celebrate my golden death day.

275
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,510
That's messed up.

276
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,330
Yeah, I was just like a speck.

277
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,470
I was basically like a little tiny spirit.

278
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,990
A spark.

279
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,290
That's so unfair!

280
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,110
I need a redo.

281
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,310
Okay, singing...

282
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,050
Oh wait, I forgot.

283
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,350
I was gonna do Metal Gear versions for this.

284
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,870
Okay.

285
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,930
Happy birthday, congratulations.

286
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,470
Happy birthday, with salutations.

287
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,730
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

288
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,530
Happy birthday to you.

289
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,250
Bolt noodle, happy birthday!

290
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,210
One more time!

291
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,150
Happy birthday, congratulations.

292
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,190
Happy birthday, with salutations.

293
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,810
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

294
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,790
Happy birthday to you.

295
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,590
Happy birthday, Chidamcha!

296
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,870
Happy birthday!

297
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,730
Alrighty.

298
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,270
Are you guys ready?

299
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,470
Are you guys ready, Freddy?

300
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,230
We have the briefing.

301
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,870
We didn't do the briefing last week.

302
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,990
So we have the briefing for Act 5.

303
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,850
And...

304
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,730
Yeah.

305
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,030
Did you know the melody for that is actually the Zanzibar Land Anthem?

306
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,670
I do actually.

307
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,230
I feel like I've heard that before.

308
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,450
I don't remember hearing the song though, when I played it.

309
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,670
Zanzibar Land.

310
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,830
Okidoki.

311
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,860
Outer Haven.

312
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,930
Mission... briefing.

313
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,740
You can only hear it in one room at certain times.

314
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,100
I guess I missed it.

315
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,650
It's like he's holding his baby.

316
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,390
Maybe not.

317
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,430
This is as fast as she'll go.

318
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,890
Liquid's target is J.D., a U.S.

319
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,470
military satellite disguised as orbital debris.

320
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,860
Haven will have to surface in order to use the railgun.

321
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,600
If we can figure out J.D.'s orbit...

322
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,070
Oh, sorry.

323
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,990
This is probably...

324
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,810
Oh my god.

325
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,450
J.D.

326
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,350
is an asynchronous elliptical orbit.

327
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,190
So its next perigee should be in...

328
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,650
Got it!

329
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,990
15 hours, 6 minutes, and 12 seconds.

330
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:57,690
Right.

331
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,270
In 15 hours, it's going to be over the Bering Sea.

332
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,070
494 nautical miles from the Bering Strait.

333
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,330
Haven knows it too.

334
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,750
They'll be holding positions in that area.

335
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,590
Did they really have to get that close to launch?

336
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,010
The nukes fired by Rex's railgun have a damage radius of approximately 300 meters.

337
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,350
The target is a moving satellite that's traveling at 10 kilometers per second.

338
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,210
To get the precision they need, they have to get as close as they possibly can.

339
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,270
Liquid won't launch his nuke until J.D.

340
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,110
is at perigee.

341
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,030
The Missouri can use that time to catch up.

342
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,450
Will we make it?

343
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,690
It's closed.

344
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,690
He's out of oxygen.

345
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,510
You'll need to use a railgun mounted on the bridge to destroy J.D.

346
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,330
You'll need to open the cover to launch the nuke.

347
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,930
That's our one and only chance to get inside.

348
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,350
Inside?

349
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,810
Why can't we attack it from here?

350
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,730
It wouldn't do any good.

351
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,970
As long as Liquid has control of the system, physically destroying G.W.

352
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,670
would still leave supreme authority in his hands.

353
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,230
Sons of the Patriots.

354
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,410
Crazy, this is the first time Otacon and Merrill have been in the same room together.

355
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,650
But they were both at Shadow Moses originally.

356
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,940
Star Wars reference.

357
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,760
Everyone is just like...

358
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,740
This man...

359
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,660
Gets me every time.

360
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,580
I can't catch the nerve of that man.

361
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,340
H.R.

362
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,340
H.R.?

363
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,480
He's just like, I might die this mission.

364
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,180
Better get a feel.

365
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,020
Microwaves?

366
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,080
The music.

367
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,140
I know, he's not joking.

368
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,270
Don't say her name.

369
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,080
I think we got that.

370
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,120
I think we understood that.

371
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,300
I'm glad Snake gets it.

372
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,300
Oh, never mind, sorry.

373
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,560
I don't want to... Sorry.

374
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,160
Jump scare.

375
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,280
Attention.

376
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,620
Listen up.

377
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,660
A wise man once wrote...

378
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,760
Tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony.

379
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,820
Where words are spent, they are seldom spent in vain.

380
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,810
Any other questions?

381
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,270
She tried.

382
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,510
Yes, Snake?

383
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,790
Anybody got a smoke?

384
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,270
This guy.

385
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:20,750
Snake!

386
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,830
Let my man smoke.

387
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,730
He's only got two left.

388
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,450
So this program...

389
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,190
You're saying Sunny wrote it?

390
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,150
Actually, only about a third of it is her work.

391
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,170
Naomi was working on a program to destroy GW.

392
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,390
But she couldn't quite finish it.

393
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,330
So she handed it over to Sunny.

394
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,190
Sunny is a better genius...

395
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,330
Sorry, I don't care.

396
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,770
I don't care about the money.

397
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,150
I just don't want to see Naomi.

398
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,550
Eventually, she found some.

399
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,710
It was Emma's worm cluster.

400
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,070
Look at him helping him.

401
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,100
Emma...

402
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,920
And even the music.

403
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,910
The glasses.

404
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,830
I know, right?

405
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,150
He's better than Emma's.

406
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,890
Sunny's worm destroys the AI's intellect by triggering apoptosis in the cells.

407
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,170
Once uploaded into GW, it should do some real damage.

408
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,610
Even now, she can help us.

409
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,910
Snake, you ever think about quitting?

410
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,750
Why?

411
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,910
It's not like I've got my health to worry about.

412
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,060
He couldn't even take it out.

413
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,120
He couldn't even take it out of his neck.

414
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,100
So awful.

415
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,540
Why don't we get somebody else to go?

416
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,720
There's no need for you to do it.

417
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,760
I still have things left to do.

418
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,580
Besides smoke.

419
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,260
Somebody stop him.

420
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,780
There's no self control.

421
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,960
Otacon, why don't you jump off the ship with me?

422
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,340
I don't think so.

423
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
I've still got things to do myself.

424
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,000
And I don't even smoke.

425
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,600
He wants Otacon to come with him.

426
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah, it's totally the nicotine that's going to kill him.

427
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,620
You should be off this boat.

428
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,040
Old Sun.

429
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,240
The final act.

430
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,460
I never used the syringes before in this game, so the syringes didn't happen.

431
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,690
You...what?

432
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,650
It's like part of the game though.

433
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,200
She's so cool.

434
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,680
Aye aye captain.

435
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,320
Aye captain.

436
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,960
Old Sun is rude.

437
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,780
It's only a billion years old.

438
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,220
Captain?

439
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes?

440
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,440
This is my first real engagement.

441
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,700
I see.

442
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,780
Your point?

443
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,500
At first, getting assigned to this ship was a big letdown for me.

444
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,360
But the inaction was kind of a relief too.

445
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Okay.

446
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,420
Your point?

447
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,680
Captain, I'm scared.

448
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,520
It's okay.

449
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,180
I'm scared too.

450
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,620
This is also my first time.

451
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,020
But I'm not going to let it get to me.

452
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,980
Because I'm more scared of what will happen if I run away.

453
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,760
Nobody is going to die on my watch.

454
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,680
This ship is going back to Hawaii in one piece.

455
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,380
That, I promise.

456
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,060
Right.

457
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,560
Thank you.

458
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,060
Mei Ling is so cool.

459
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,780
In one piece.

460
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,640
The team!

461
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,160
The team!

462
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,460
That

463
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,990
guy.

464
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,870
Final mission.

465
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,480
Raiden.

466
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,680
How is he?

467
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
He'll live.

468
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,840
But he's in no shape to fight.

469
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,380
Tell Raiden.

470
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,500
Best to let him rest.

471
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,460
Right.

472
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,780
Without the system to protect them, everybody is losing their nerve.

473
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,400
They say S.O.P.'s after effects are so bad that a lot of soldiers are deserting.

474
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,660
Oh yeah, that's right.

475
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,040
Their nanomachines are...

476
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,420
The only one left to rely on is Marilyn.

477
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,400
Him.

478
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,260
Kind of an unknown fatty, isn't he?

479
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,780
I hooked him up with a non-IDM82.

480
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,060
Fancy meeting you here.

481
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,780
What are you doing here?

482
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,140
Johnny is such a horndog.

483
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,500
I laundered these guys' IDs.

484
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,200
Then issued them new naked weapons.

485
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,740
Including that catapult you're going to be riding.

486
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,120
Business has been slow ever since Liquid got his hands on the system.

487
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,920
His extra orders stopped coming in.

488
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,020
Sir, you're caffeine addiction.

489
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,900
Now that all the weapons all over the world are locked, the only ones still looking to fight would be you and yours.

490
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:25,280
They tell me it's not economical to replace all that useless equipment on the battlefield with my stuff.

491
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,760
So I made an extra special trip out here, just for you.

492
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
And you're gonna give me an extra special?

493
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,400
Discount.

494
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,930
I like Drebin because...

495
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,930
Well, sometimes I like him.

496
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,490
He has no business being here.

497
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,950
He's like Naomi, but he doesn't try to make himself the main character.

498
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,130
He's just kind of curious what's going on.

499
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,210
The pose, I know.

500
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,470
He's like, hey, snake, I can do it too.

501
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,430
Indirect kiss with Drebin?

502
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,690
Okay, indirect kiss with...

503
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,230
You just give it to the monkey instead.

504
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,530
The monkey also has a caffeine addiction.

505
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,130
Both of them.

506
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,330
They need to get... Lay off the... The guy has his own...

507
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,090
The guy has his own...

508
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,730
Vending machine.

509
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,010
How'd he do that?

510
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:44,990
Magic.

511
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,850
He's a wizard.

512
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:53,010
It's his last one.

513
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,530
The monkey is like, give me... I also have a nicotine addiction.

514
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,450
Don't give it to him, snake!

515
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,530
Don't!

516
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,990
Don't!

517
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,050
Have you.

518
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,480
Snake can't even enjoy a last cigarette.

519
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,220
You're welcome.

520
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,780
Oh my god.

521
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, let's get going.

522
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,100
You're over there.

523
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,100
There.

524
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,100
What she said.

525
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,900
That's what she said.

526
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,300
Yeah, it is animal abuse.

527
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,960
Snake, can you hear me?

528
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,080
Liquid's warship, Outer Haven, is a modified version of an Arsenal Gear model stolen from the Patriots.

529
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,700
Arsenal Gear.

530
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,560
Inside, it's crawling with Irving and other unmanned weapons.

531
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:20,520
According to Naomi's data, Haven is crewed by a battalion of enhanced soldiers, each called from the best the PMCs have to offer.

532
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:36,200
If Liquid succeeds in destroying JD and gaining control of the Patriots' system, he'll make Haven his flagship, and his PMCs will spread like wildfire across the globe.

533
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,840
Here he comes!

534
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,880
And then, mankind's armed subjugation will begin.

535
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,660
He's huge.

536
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm nervous.

537
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,200
That's mean.

538
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,740
That's mean.

539
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,900
That thing is so big.

540
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,600
Oh my gosh.

541
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,980
Listen closely.

542
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,460
This is our last chance to stop Liquid from enslaving the planet.

543
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,220
So they were gonna make Arsenal Gear just like a long turd.

544
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,280
Instead, they made it into a turd.

545
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,940
Meryl, can you hear me?

546
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,440
It's time.

547
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,900
Time to do your duty.

548
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:54,640
Remember, no matter what happens, I'll be with you till the very end.

549
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,620
You are my pride and joy.

550
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,790
She's so cool.

551
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,030
She's so cool, even with the nanomachines being turned off.

552
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,690
She's so strong.

553
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,110
Is he deliberately Lucifer-coded?

554
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,170
Possibly.

555
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,410
This game has a lot of religious imagery.

556
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,230
It's the Railgun!

557
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,970
There it is.

558
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,470
A naked nuke.

559
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,850
Let's finish it, Snake.

560
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,810
Let this be our last battle.

561
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:05,090
If we are responsible for Liquid's sins, then the onus is ours to bear.

562
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,750
Right.

563
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,520
Enemy moving to intercept!

564
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,260
Maintain full speed!

565
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,440
Be careful!

566
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,540
Failure will spell doom for the human race.

567
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,900
No pressure!

568
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,580
You will have to stop them from using that Railgun.

569
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,900
Then annihilate GW.

570
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,440
It feels so like...

571
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,780
It feels so scary coming from Colonel.

572
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,280
It feels too scary coming from him.

573
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,040
That's a lot of missiles.

574
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,250
Nice.

575
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,950
That's not good.

576
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:20,810
Oh gosh.

577
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,790
This is basically a movie.

578
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,710
Don't worry, we are going to play the game...

579
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,190
Soon.

580
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,070
Oh gosh.

581
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,070
It hasn't been an hour.

582
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:40,670
Don't worry.

583
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
That

584
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,500
doesn't sound good.

585
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,110
It's our turn too!

586
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,370
Oh gosh.

587
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,450
Oh gosh.

588
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,050
That's

589
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,580
our cue!

590
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,120
Evangelion launch.

591
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,340
I mean Snake Launching.

592
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,270
Alright, it's our turn!

593
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,250
Oh gosh.

594
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,330
Oh gosh.

595
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,440
Those catapults must be hard on the core.

596
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,560
Don't say that.

597
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,540
The sounds are so spooky.

598
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,260
Oh my gosh.

599
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,040
They are so spooky.

600
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,450
How is everyone more fragile than Snake?

601
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:32,530
Yeah.

602
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,130
Let me hit it because I'm goofy.

603
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,230
Thank you so much for the 20.

604
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:46,970
Meryl!

605
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,170
Oh!

606
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,510
I watched the 86 Transformers movie last night.

607
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,930
Surprised to see Paul Eiding's name in the credits.

608
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:56,370
Oh really?

609
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:57,770
Uh oh.

610
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:58,830
Retro!

611
00:46:59,470 --> 00:46:59,990
Uh oh!

612
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:00,510
Retro!

613
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:01,670
Uh oh!

614
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,510
Retro!

615
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,420
If they were shooting at him, does that not mean they saw him?

616
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,500
No?

617
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:13,520
No?

618
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,080
Okay.

619
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,340
Alright, hold on.

620
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,680
Before we...

621
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,540
Yay!

622
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,460
Everything is half off, baby!

623
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,680
So how much is everything then?

624
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,740
2,500,000.

625
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,440
We're still not even...

626
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,300
Oh my gosh, we're still so far.

627
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,920
It's still so much.

628
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,720
Thank you for the super chat, Duke.

629
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,760
Appreciate it.

630
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,360
Alright, let me set up my... Let's set up my weapons too.

631
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,580
Alright, so we're gonna be using this M82A2.

632
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:06,860
For sure.

633
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,980
I do know that.

634
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,220
I will be not using the railgun.

635
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,720
Instead, we'll use our pistol.

636
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,980
I'll even grab...

637
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,590
Maybe this.

638
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,450
I don't know how much I'll be sniping to be honest, but...

639
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,070
Well, unless we use the twin barrel.

640
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,990
The farming is not quite yet.

641
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,390
But I don't think I'll be doing it on this stream.

642
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,870
Unfortunately.

643
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,810
One day... One day...

644
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,870
I will get the bandana.

645
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,330
Well, I could also get the bandana.

646
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:50,810
What is it?

647
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,750
You'll get the bandana...

648
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,870
It's not... It's not getting big boss rank.

649
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,550
I think it's just...

650
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,430
Less than like 10 kills or something in the game.

651
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,190
Isn't it or something?

652
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,470
Is it no kills?

653
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,540
No kills.

654
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,200
Bandana is no kills.

655
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,100
I want the stealth.

656
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,100
I want the octocamo.

657
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,940
Well, we have octo.

658
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,100
You know, I want the...

659
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:21,740
Whatever.

660
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,540
I can't... I'm not remembering.

661
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,900
Let's just do this for now.

662
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,780
Actually, no.

663
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,700
I lied.

664
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,460
I do want the... I do want this instead.

665
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,320
I do want this one instead.

666
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,120
I have no chaff, so get rid of it.

667
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,820
I can't rely on chaffs, but I will maybe grab a stun grenade.

668
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,440
Maybe.

669
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,460
I don't think... Does playboy even work for the...

670
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,600
For the frogs?

671
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,680
Not that I've put down any at all anyway.

672
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,840
You know what?

673
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,100
We can do this instead.

674
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,840
Yuri?

675
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:03,940
Yuri?

676
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,760
If they're cool, yeah.

677
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,020
Alright, this is for...

678
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,800
This is for the...

679
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,900
Geckos.

680
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,660
This is for the people.

681
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:17,660
Alright.

682
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,640
I'm scared.

683
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,700
Oh, I'm scared.

684
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh my gosh, they're right there.

685
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,120
They're right there.

686
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:39,700
Scary!

687
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:39,800
Scary!

688
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:47,270
Okay, alright.

689
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,650
I know where to go.

690
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,590
I just am scared.

691
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,280
Oh my god, there's so many people.

692
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,660
There's so many people!

693
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,200
There's so many of them!

694
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, just your imagination.

695
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,520
Exactly.

696
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,560
Where are you going?

697
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,840
Oh, she's jumping around.

698
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,800
Oh my god, please stop flying.

699
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,720
Okay.

700
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,620
Am I good?

701
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,480
No, I'm not good.

702
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:29,740
Wait,

703
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,540
did they see that?

704
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,260
No?

705
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,540
No one's there.

706
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,580
Onwards!

707
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:45,880
Onwards!

708
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,440
On...

709
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,080
Shit.

710
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:53,940
No!

711
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,140
Oh my god, I just stuck them up.

712
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,800
I didn't even mean to.

713
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,460
I was already on alert though, was I not?

714
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,200
Oh god!

715
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Oh god, they actually see me.

716
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,260
Oh shit.

717
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,180
Can I barrel?

718
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,320
Can I... Will they see me if I barrel?

719
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,160
Do I have my barrel?

720
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,940
No, I don't have...

721
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,660
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

722
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

723
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:25,480
Um...

724
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,240
We don't need this.

725
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,840
Drum can!

726
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,520
Yeah, the alert never goes away.

727
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Technically, I've been on alert this whole time.

728
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,860
Oh god.

729
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,740
It's really that guy that I have to worry about?

730
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,480
Did you just throw a grenade?

731
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,380
You bastard!

732
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,100
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

733
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,180
Oh my gosh.

734
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,080
Can I... Can I... Wait.

735
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,940
Alright, let's...

736
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,240
Oh, jeez.

737
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

738
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,540
Sorry, sorry.

739
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,370
I'm getting... I'm getting a little...

740
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,080
I'm getting a little...

741
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,300
I'm getting a little flustered.

742
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,220
I hate this part.

743
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,260
I hate this part.

744
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,430
Are you down?

745
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:31,890
There we go.

746
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,590
Oh my gosh.

747
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,310
Because we gotta destroy these...

748
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,430
Since...

749
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,690
What's on fire?

750
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,530
Oh my gosh.

751
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:44,270
No!

752
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,490
There we go.

753
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,670
This lady is still knocked out.

754
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:52,990
We're gonna do it again.

755
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,630
Actually, let me just put her to sleep.

756
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,790
Oops, let me reload.

757
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,590
And sleep.

758
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,630
Okay, good job, good job.

759
00:53:59,290 --> 00:53:59,630
Alright.

760
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,050
Alright, there's gonna be...

761
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,030
A door over there.

762
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:05,850
We gotta get through.

763
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:08,950
Hold

764
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:14,730
on!

765
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,150
Oh my god, please.

766
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,270
Jeez, lady.

767
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:20,490
Holy...

768
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,430
Alright, I'm gonna have to go for it.

769
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,910
In a minute.

770
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:23,510
Oh god!

771
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:29,570
Let's go!

772
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,400
Oh god.

773
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,600
No, no, no!

774
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,260
This is the part I hate the most!

775
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,960
Save me!

776
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,680
Oh shit.

777
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:09,820
Please!

778
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,640
Everything is bad.

779
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,520
Everything is bad right now.

780
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,440
Everything is so bad.

781
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,600
I hate this part!

782
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,360
No!

783
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,360
Let me through, please!

784
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,770
I'm so dead.

785
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:29,410
I'm so dead.

786
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,090
I'm so dead.

787
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:30,830
I'm so dead.

788
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:31,810
I'm so dead!

789
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,700
I hate this part!

790
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,840
I'm also gonna grenade!

791
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:43,780
Nevermind!

792
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,120
Strategic...

793
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,980
Strategic fail!

794
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,080
I

795
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,910
hate this part!

796
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,890
I never know how to do this part!

797
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,210
Ever!

798
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,710
I never know how to do this part!

799
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,150
I never know!

800
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:27,370
I never know!

801
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,470
I never know!

802
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,570
I never know!

803
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:30,650
I never know!

804
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,320
Snake!

805
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,560
Snake!

806
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,520
Oh

807
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,700
my god!

808
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:14,270
How did I...

809
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,270
How did I get auto...

810
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,930
I just suddenly have auto-aim on.

811
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,650
You bitch!

812
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,570
Please!

813
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,890
Oh, I have no bullets.

814
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,570
I'm gonna...

815
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,410
I'm gonna...

816
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:34,870
I'm gonna...

817
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,250
What's the point of even continuing?

818
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,920
I have one ration left.

819
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,240
I literally wasted all of them.

820
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,540
What's even the point of continuing onwards?

821
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,440
What's even the point?

822
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,380
What's even the point?

823
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,280
What's even the point?

824
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,200
What's the point?

825
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
What's the point?

826
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,380
I hate that part!

827
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,260
I'm almost half tempted to just kill myself and...

828
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,620
Start over.

829
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,620
I was fine until...

830
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,980
Until the...

831
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,060
Dang...

832
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,880
Stupid ass...

833
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,020
Stupid...

834
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,720
Metal gears...

835
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,680
Or not the metal gears...

836
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,600
The geckos...

837
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,420
I'm so angry!

838
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,560
I'm so...

839
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,240
I'm so angry!

840
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,360
I'm so mad!

841
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,060
I'm so angry!

842
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:07,240
I'm so angry!

843
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,720
Who's there?

844
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,960
How did you get there, Meryl?

845
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,630
I have a lot of stun grenades.

846
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,370
Maybe I do try cheesing it.

847
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,850
Oh boy, that's a lot of people!

848
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,790
That's a lot of people!

849
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,090
And...

850
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,330
Don't start shooting at me, please!

851
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,790
Okay, hold on...

852
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,690
I hate that it switches out my gun every time.

853
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:21,530
I hate it!

854
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:23,870
I wonder...

855
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,350
I don't remember if I killed them or not though.

856
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,530
Actually, what did I have there?

857
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,450
I don't even remember.

858
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,490
What if I just killed them all?

859
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,310
What's the point of doing...

860
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,190
Doing non-lethal anyway anymore?

861
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,450
What's the point?

862
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:40,830
No!

863
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,030
Anyway...

864
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,330
Ouch!

865
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:06,330
Come on!

866
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,450
I'm trying to...

867
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,070
Snake!

868
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,350
Oh my god!

869
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,830
You seriously, you stupid...

870
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,790
Stupid ass!

871
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,690
I can't with you right now.

872
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:15,470
Oh my god.

873
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,370
Ouch!

874
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,550
I think I really just want to die.

875
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,150
Is this what humans feel?

876
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,810
Is this how humans feel?

877
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:24,770
Is this it?

878
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,250
Do I finally understand?

879
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,030
Wishing for sweet death?

880
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,590
I'm a ghost, so I don't really understand.

881
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,070
I don't really get it, but...

882
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,750
Today I just really am...

883
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,530
Just ready to end it all, I think.

884
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,710
I think I'm just ready to end it all.

885
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,200
Sorry, I'm a bit going through it today, you guys.

886
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,480
There we go.

887
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,940
Wait, is there anybody left?

888
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,280
Oh, they're

889
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,260
upstairs.

890
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,240
Oh no!

891
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,240
I forgot to leave one!

892
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,760
Oh well, it's fine.

893
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,260
I got you though, right?

894
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,100
Oh my god, my aim.

895
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,020
Please.

896
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,300
My aim.

897
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,340
Come on, snake.

898
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,340
You got this.

899
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,420
I just keep hitting glass.

900
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,680
I think you're getting it.

901
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,460
I think you got her.

902
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:32,940
Probably.

903
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,460
Did you get her?

904
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,240
I can't tell.

905
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,260
That one, I think I saw bounce off, literally.

906
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,080
Stop, snake!

907
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,300
Stop seeing double!

908
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,860
Actually, this is kind of what my VR headset looked like yesterday.

909
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:51,720
I'm not gonna lie.

910
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,860
This is how I was viewing the entire stream yesterday.

911
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,380
Hello.

912
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,310
Why am I so bad at everything?

913
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,080
Where's the other ones?

914
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh, they're coming down.

915
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,280
Hello.

916
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,020
I'm just gonna lay and get more...

917
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,240
Get more health.

918
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,580
I wanna restart.

919
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,050
I wanna restart the game.

920
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,510
I'm so weak.

921
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,610
I'm so bad.

922
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:02,830
Where did you come from?

923
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,710
She's right in front of you!

924
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,530
How could you crash?

925
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,710
I wanna restart.

926
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,510
I have no rations left.

927
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,950
Hold on, guys.

928
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,050
Sorry, I need a break.

929
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,930
I just started the stream!

930
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,210
I'm sorry!

931
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,500
I considered canceling stream today, I'll be honest.

932
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,520
But I didn't want to hold off Metal Gear.

933
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,370
Okay, I just gotta get over it.

934
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:37,930
Sorry, guys.

935
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,170
Sorry, sorry.

936
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,460
Yeah, Sunny for motivation.

937
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,070
The iPad or the iPod.

938
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,470
What is Sunny doing?

939
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:31,770
Is she cooking?

940
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:32,770
I can't tell.

941
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,190
Sunny, turn around!

942
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,550
Is she playing her PSP?

943
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:05,490
Is she?

944
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,330
It's so hard to tell.

945
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,250
I can't tell.

946
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,070
She looks stressed, too.

947
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,090
She's just like me, for real, for real.

948
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,350
It looks like her hands are on her head.

949
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,380
Sorry.

950
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,740
I'm so sorry, guys.

951
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,910
Okay, let's just do our best, I suppose.

952
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,590
If I die, I die.

953
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,210
I don't even know where they're at.

954
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,170
Oh, there's one.

955
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:34,810
There's one!

956
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,850
What the hell are you shooting from?

957
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:42,750
Oh god, we're gonna die.

958
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,090
Where did you go?

959
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,230
Where did you go from?

960
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,150
Actually, I think I will just die.

961
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:48,870
You know what?

962
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:49,590
Let's just die.

963
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,170
Let's just start over.

964
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,390
Kill me, please!

965
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:52,950
Kill me!

966
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,270
Let me start over.

967
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,210
Kill me.

968
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,150
Kill me.

969
01:08:58,810 --> 01:08:59,290
Oh, okay.

970
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,710
Where does... How do you jump up like that?

971
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,810
Where do you go?

972
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,670
Just kill me.

973
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,310
Just kill me.

974
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:08,890
There we go.

975
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,350
Okay.

976
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,800
But I think I'm in more danger.

977
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,460
I think before they get to me.

978
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,260
Otacon!

979
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,560
I'm the one in danger!

980
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,940
Can I even go through here?

981
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,720
Oh shit.

982
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,960
Oop, oop, oop.

983
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,670
What if I lay here?

984
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,550
Oop, oop.

985
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:00,910
I got you.

986
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,190
I turned around.

987
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,890
Damn it.

988
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:05,650
So close.

989
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:09,350
She was like, ah, no, I'm not gonna deal with that.

990
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:22,210
They're all like falling asleep around Meryl's body actually.

991
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,780
Oop, oop.

992
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,700
Nope, nope, nope.

993
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:34,740
Ouch!

994
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:43,120
I thought it was gonna be another stun, like the flashbang.

995
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,740
Where are they shooting at?

996
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,800
Friendly fire.

997
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:50,840
Friendly fire.

998
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,700
Oh, there's one.

999
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:53,480
Dang it.

1000
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,280
Just missed her.

1001
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,390
Ai, ai, ai.

1002
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,530
Oh, wait, wait, where'd you go?

1003
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,170
Stop moving so fast.

1004
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,250
Where'd you go?

1005
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,090
No, I really can't see you.

1006
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:13,730
Oh, there you are, I think.

1007
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:14,630
Is that you?

1008
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:17,610
No, nobody's there.

1009
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,110
Oh, oh wait, I think they already fell asleep.

1010
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:24,250
Alright.

1011
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:29,190
No, this isn't the Mantis fight quite yet.

1012
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,450
Not yet.

1013
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,080
Hello!

1014
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,040
I need to

1015
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,530
move out from my safety corner.

1016
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,260
I thought more would come down to see me.

1017
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,140
Mark...Wait.

1018
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:10,560
No.

1019
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,180
Marco!

1020
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,700
Where are they even shooting at?

1021
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,340
I think they think they see me.

1022
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,500
But they're just a little silly.

1023
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,540
I feel like I should move, but...

1024
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,860
I also don't quite want to.

1025
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,880
I got a good little spot here.

1026
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,080
And you're telling me to get out of that?

1027
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,030
Are they above me?

1028
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,440
Oh, the Mark III.

1029
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,460
Where are you?

1030
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,700
Oh, wait there.

1031
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,520
Go Mark III!

1032
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:03,620
Neon!

1033
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,580
Just kidding.

1034
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,020
Bodies are heavy.

1035
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,300
Bodies are big and heavy.

1036
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,440
Where are they?

1037
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,320
There's a guy there.

1038
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,620
I think they're up here.

1039
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,680
Oh yeah, they see.

1040
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,240
They think they see me.

1041
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,640
Or they probably do, they just can't get to me.

1042
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,020
And they won't move anywhere.

1043
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,740
So it's those two...three.

1044
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:31,520
Oh wait!

1045
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,060
I saw that person.

1046
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,280
There they are.

1047
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,260
Can you like move a little bit over here?

1048
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,680
Just a tiny bit.

1049
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:50,240
Like right exactly here.

1050
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,740
Are they even gonna come back?

1051
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,120
Oh gosh.

1052
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,540
I'm gonna try and get rid of that glass.

1053
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,920
There they are.

1054
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,300
And now...

1055
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,780
Yeah, triangles first.

1056
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,340
Got them?

1057
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,320
Thank you!

1058
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,940
Now you leave.

1059
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,020
Now you jump down, huh?

1060
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,740
Wait, what if I...

1061
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,740
Come here.

1062
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:51,880
Come here.

1063
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,020
Come here!

1064
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:55,880
I go!

1065
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,360
I got him.

1066
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,460
I got myself too.

1067
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,140
Flashbang rail.

1068
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,430
Snake, you're kinda going through it, but that's okay buddy.

1069
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,430
We can power through without our meds.

1070
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,320
That's right.

1071
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,020
The pile of bodies grows.

1072
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,040
I saw, but somebody just jumped down.

1073
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,500
As long as they come over here and don't...

1074
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,360
Oh, I was gonna say don't jump.

1075
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,560
Shit.

1076
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,560
The pile of bodies grows.

1077
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,600
Frog pile.

1078
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:10,790
Not everyone is coming and seeing the frog pile.

1079
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,450
And they're like...

1080
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,270
I don't think that's safe.

1081
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,310
That doesn't seem pretty good.

1082
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,450
That doesn't seem...

1083
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:17,670
Nope.

1084
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,270
This doesn't seem...

1085
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:22,830
This doesn't seem very good over here, does it?

1086
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:23,830
No!

1087
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:28,290
Some of them are too fast for me.

1088
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,670
This is the best spawn...

1089
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,170
No.

1090
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,070
No, no, no!

1091
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,250
That was so close.

1092
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:42,990
What if they ended up throwing the grenade, but it like... right there.

1093
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:44,390
Oh!

1094
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:44,850
Yay!

1095
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:45,770
We did it!

1096
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,900
Where did all the bodies go?

1097
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,040
Meryl is like just completely covered in frogs.

1098
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,320
The frog pile huggers.

1099
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,260
That's a lot of bodies.

1100
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,420
And they were just like... some of them would come over and just like turn around.

1101
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,120
It's so funny.

1102
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,080
Where have I seen this before?

1103
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:27,730
Snake?

1104
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:29,750
Run!

1105
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:35,090
Oh gosh.

1106
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:43,750
Asaka!

1107
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,210
No!

1108
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,570
It can't be!

1109
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:53,050
The fishing wire is so lame though.

1110
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,810
I'll be honest.

1111
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,710
You wish you were him.

1112
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,970
You wish you were him!

1113
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,200
Oh my gosh, our savior.

1114
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,580
Johnny!

1115
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:34,580
My man ate those heads.

1116
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,940
Screaming Mantis.

1117
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:01,480
I just realized...

1118
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,940
That's why it's called the sorrow doll.

1119
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,100
It's based off the sorrow.

1120
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,920
Oh my god.

1121
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,360
I just realized it looks like the sorrow.

1122
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,100
So that's the Mantis one.

1123
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,060
That's all we have.

1124
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,800
I just realized it.

1125
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,060
I never noticed what they look like.

1126
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,800
Oh Johnny!

1127
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,620
He's taking psychic damage.

1128
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,060
See?

1129
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,860
You can see it.

1130
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,420
I don't remember how to do this fight at all.

1131
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,460
How could you not notice until now?

1132
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,740
I don't know.

1133
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,500
I'm just not observing I guess.

1134
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,500
Couples activity idea?

1135
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,240
Which part?

1136
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,290
Do I need the camera?

1137
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:20,770
I guess not.

1138
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,030
Oh wait.

1139
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,110
Just kidding.

1140
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:34,490
The doll is under here.

1141
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:35,910
Mantis doll.

1142
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:37,950
Let's see what it does.

1143
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:43,110
I only have the Mantis doll.

1144
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:46,230
That's why I never took a good look at the sorrow doll.

1145
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,910
I don't have the sorrow doll.

1146
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:56,170
I just never looked at him.

1147
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:57,170
I just didn't look.

1148
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:00,610
I just realized why the mint plush is called mint plush.

1149
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:03,230
I just thought that it was just like...

1150
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,880
Sad doll.

1151
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,540
But that also explains what happens after this fight too.

1152
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,260
I have so much more context now.

1153
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,180
Look at this guy.

1154
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,740
What a gamer posture.

1155
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,740
His head is even too heavy for his neck.

1156
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,860
Who designed this?

1157
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,400
Skinny legend.

1158
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,380
Creator and age unknown.

1159
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,340
I think they are just embarrassed.

1160
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,340
Has the ability to release ghosts!

1161
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:54,640
If a ghost hits a person with active nanomachines, it will allow you to manipulate their body.

1162
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,640
Let's try it out.

1163
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,040
In what way?

1164
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,580
I guess we'll see.

1165
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,680
Ready with L1.

1166
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
Release ghost with R1.

1167
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,240
Releasing ghost!

1168
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,660
Release ghost!

1169
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,160
Release!

1170
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,040
Release!

1171
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:14,980
Release!

1172
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,140
Release!

1173
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,300
Release!

1174
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:18,600
Release!

1175
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,440
Oh god dammit.

1176
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,040
Why did you do this to me?

1177
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,760
Ouch!

1178
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:30,060
Release!

1179
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,120
Release!

1180
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,320
I'm really bad at this.

1181
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,140
Release!

1182
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:34,920
Release!

1183
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,320
Release!

1184
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,040
Oh my god.

1185
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:38,680
Release!

1186
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:39,800
Release!

1187
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,000
Release!

1188
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,360
Nenees!

1189
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,540
Nenees!

1190
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,400
Nenees!

1191
01:22:59,140 --> 01:22:59,760
Nenees!

1192
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,120
Release!

1193
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:02,060
Release!

1194
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,120
I'm so bad at this.

1195
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,480
Release!

1196
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,040
Release!

1197
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:12,120
Release!

1198
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,040
How is everyone?

1199
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,000
I know they are ducking and dodging.

1200
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,600
I just think it's funny.

1201
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,480
Release!

1202
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,580
Oh my gosh, my own.

1203
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,280
Don't control me!

1204
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,720
Don't control me!

1205
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,460
Nenees!

1206
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,300
Nenees!

1207
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,360
Oh my gosh, ouch.

1208
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:58,660
Where is he anyway?

1209
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,000
Uh-oh.

1210
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:03,680
Uh-oh.

1211
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:04,580
What's that sound?

1212
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:11,770
Isn't there something with cutting the wires or the strings too?

1213
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,810
Gosh, I can't remember.

1214
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,090
The globe?

1215
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:17,270
Oh there he is!

1216
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:18,290
Nenees!

1217
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,270
Nenees!

1218
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:24,390
Oh gosh, I got to get rid of the wires somehow.

1219
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,750
Do I have to syringe?

1220
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,890
Come here Meryl.

1221
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,170
Come

1222
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:54,040
here!

1223
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:54,660
Come here!

1224
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:09,840
Come here!

1225
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,780
I can't even be angry.

1226
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,960
Oh my gosh, how do you use it on yourself again?

1227
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:25,020
I can't remember how to do it.

1228
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:25,340
X?

1229
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,860
You guys, it's not X.

1230
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,140
Use it in menu.

1231
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,160
Oh, that's right.

1232
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:32,980
I never use it.

1233
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,560
Thank you!

1234
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,420
Nenees!

1235
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,240
Nenees!

1236
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,780
Nenees!

1237
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,820
Does this do anything?

1238
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:44,920
Nenees!

1239
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:48,120
Oh, I'm really taking bullets again.

1240
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,330
Nenees!

1241
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:53,530
Maybe to him.

1242
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,320
Nenees!

1243
01:25:59,380 --> 01:25:59,780
Nenees!

1244
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,180
Nenees!

1245
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,340
Nenees!

1246
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,880
Oh geez.

1247
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,500
Oh shit, it didn't do anything.

1248
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,560
Oh Mantis, why you gotta have such special...

1249
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,380
How much special things about you, huh?

1250
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,460
Hold on, I gotta gain some more health.

1251
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,280
Oh, oh yay!

1252
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,620
Alright, turn around snake.

1253
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,460
Turn around, there we go.

1254
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:48,960
Nice.

1255
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,100
And let's see if we can get anybody from here.

1256
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,200
I gotta get the sorrow one though.

1257
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:09,740
Oh god!

1258
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,580
What the hell is that?

1259
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,580
Oh shit.

1260
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,960
Hey, can you guys chill for a second?

1261
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,440
Chill for like two seconds, please.

1262
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,760
I don't know how to do this damn fight.

1263
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:53,000
Oh my gosh, so scary.

1264
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,640
I need your doll, please!

1265
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,760
Oh, I'm out of bullets.

1266
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,340
Not good.

1267
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:10,280
I got another ration though, that's good.

1268
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:16,600
Ok.

1269
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,160
Did it drop?

1270
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,400
It didn't seem to drop.

1271
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,980
I mean, did it drop it?

1272
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:29,580
Oh no!

1273
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,080
Oh no, it's so familiar!

1274
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:33,300
Familiar!

1275
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,540
Oh my god.

1276
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,060
Drop it!

1277
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,420
Drop it!

1278
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:55,720
Drop it!

1279
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,860
Drop your doll!

1280
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,900
My doll!

1281
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:03,860
Ouch!

1282
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:04,740
Oh jeez.

1283
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,120
Ok, I gotta do my thingy again.

1284
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,620
It's hanging on by literal threads.

1285
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,500
Sorry.

1286
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:28,540
Where is she?

1287
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,200
Oh my god.

1288
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:32,480
Oops.

1289
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,380
Good thing everybody has bad aim.

1290
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,880
Good thing they all have bad aim.

1291
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,120
Oh my goodness.

1292
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,440
Drop your sorrow doll, please.

1293
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:44,740
Please!

1294
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,620
I need it.

1295
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,360
Ouch.

1296
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,980
I need it actually.

1297
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,720
Can I have your doll?

1298
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,780
Just one more hit.

1299
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,240
You bastard.

1300
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,740
I got that guy.

1301
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,090
Oh I'm out of bullets!

1302
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:25,090
I need to buy more.

1303
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:26,570
I need to buy more bullets.

1304
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:27,990
Ok.

1305
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:28,850
Alright.

1306
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:30,530
We're doing alright guys.

1307
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,510
We're doing ok.

1308
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,430
We're doing alright.

1309
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,370
Just normal bullets.

1310
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:38,190
What a time to be out of ammo, right?

1311
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,830
It's only 600 dp.

1312
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:44,690
More bullets!

1313
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:47,230
Damn it.

1314
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:48,630
I forgot that I needed to reload.

1315
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,200
Take that.

1316
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,460
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1317
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,880
Can you get out of my way?

1318
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,420
These guys are pain in my side.

1319
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:16,210
Are you throwing people at me now?

1320
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,560
Dang it!

1321
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,060
You made me lose my shot!

1322
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,100
I thought for a second.

1323
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:29,740
Dang it.

1324
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,140
Dang it.

1325
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,240
Oh shit.

1326
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,630
Ow, ow, ow.

1327
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:42,930
Oh, ouch.

1328
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,350
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1329
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:47,750
Please.

1330
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,920
Oh, I need to reload.

1331
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,460
Oh my god.

1332
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,260
I'm too slow.

1333
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:17,840
Yes!

1334
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:21,940
Oh my god.

1335
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:27,350
I got it.

1336
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,430
I got it!

1337
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,240
I'm gonna get your other one too.

1338
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,560
I'm gonna steal both of them.

1339
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:01,740
I'm gonna take them all.

1340
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,240
You'll have nothing left.

1341
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,800
I'm gonna rob you blind!

1342
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,400
I'm gonna rob you!

1343
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:09,480
Rob

1344
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,780
you, screaming mantis.

1345
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
You will have nothing left to your name.

1346
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,040
Nothing mantis about you.

1347
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,130
Please!

1348
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:53,820
Get the other.

1349
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,720
Oh, hi Meryl.

1350
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:55,520
Ouch.

1351
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,800
I'm gonna try and get some of these guys down too.

1352
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:06,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1353
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,280
Oh my gosh, even that, even...

1354
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,800
Oops, why did I do that?

1355
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,540
Oh my

1356
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,580
gosh!

1357
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:35,470
Can I add the... I wonder if it does anything now.

1358
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:40,530
I know the dolls are supposed to do damage, but I don't know if it's after you...

1359
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,060
Okay, now?

1360
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:54,920
I wonder.

1361
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,060
Okay, there we go.

1362
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,160
It's not taking any damage though.

1363
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,200
Oh, I hate these things.

1364
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,620
I hate these things!

1365
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:42,220
Oh my gosh!

1366
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,980
I got a mantis her.

1367
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,380
It's the doll, mantis doll?

1368
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:51,600
Okay.

1369
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,140
Why am I so bad?

1370
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,960
It's okay to backseat because I don't remember how to do this fight.

1371
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:15,800
Ha!

1372
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:16,260
Ha!

1373
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:16,680
Ha!

1374
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,220
Ha!

1375
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:17,920
Ha!

1376
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:18,640
Ha!

1377
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,000
Ha!

1378
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,160
Ha!

1379
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:19,480
Ha!

1380
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,280
A rag doll.

1381
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:33,760
And we got both dolls!

1382
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,400
Yippee!

1383
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,390
We shook her.

1384
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:42,910
We shook her good.

1385
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,630
Where is her statue?

1386
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,600
That don't seem so good.

1387
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,640
Yeah, time to see her beautified form.

1388
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:29,190
No!

1389
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:30,470
All her little eggies!

1390
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:31,890
Oh gosh, snake!

1391
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,010
Maybe you have any sort of survival instinct there.

1392
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,390
All her grey hairs.

1393
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,050
Oh yeah!

1394
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:47,770
They do look like dwarf gecko arms, right?

1395
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,650
They could very well be.

1396
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,790
Statue should be where you camped against the frogs.

1397
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:55,450
Oh, no kidding!

1398
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,270
That's so funny.

1399
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:57,650
Thank you.

1400
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:00,530
Thanks for helping me guys against the fight.

1401
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:02,210
Thank you, thank you.

1402
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:05,590
There's always something silly with these fights, right?

1403
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:08,130
With the mantis.

1404
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,390
It's the mantis style.

1405
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:12,150
Yeah, we did it!

1406
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,160
Mmhm.

1407
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:22,160
And that's the last babe.

1408
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,760
That's the last beauty babe too.

1409
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,240
My vision.

1410
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,040
Oh my goodness.

1411
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,640
I can't help it, they're just in my face!

1412
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,440
I can't help it!

1413
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,960
They're right there!

1414
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,100
The screams.

1415
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,900
Me too.

1416
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,260
Make them stop!

1417
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,200
I don't want to hear them anymore!

1418
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:51,050
She hit the invisible wall.

1419
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:53,770
The edge of the world.

1420
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:57,910
Is she a mime?

1421
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:09,320
Nah.

1422
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,520
Get out of my body.

1423
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,570
Forgive me.

1424
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,600
Ahem.

1425
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,720
One moment ma'am.

1426
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:38,560
Where did I camp out over here?

1427
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:45,800
There's a pretty little statue right here that I need to grab.

1428
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,420
Yeah!

1429
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,700
That's the last one!

1430
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:50,800
Oh, wait.

1431
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,600
I'm stuck in here?

1432
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,340
Ok, just kidding.

1433
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:57,960
Explosion!

1434
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,040
She's really slow.

1435
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,900
Sometimes they're very fast, right?

1436
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:02,860
But she's very slow.

1437
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,580
Let's get our twin barrel.

1438
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,320
For later.

1439
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,440
Hello ma'am!

1440
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:15,650
Look at her walking around.

1441
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:16,910
Thanks for the superchats you guys!

1442
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:18,050
I'll read them in a second.

1443
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:27,820
Nothing here.

1444
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:32,870
Hello ma'am.

1445
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:34,290
I'm running.

1446
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,130
Does it work on her?

1447
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:39,570
I wonder.

1448
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,530
I don't know actually.

1449
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,800
Doesn't seem like it.

1450
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,360
She dodges it.

1451
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,700
I think it's too slow for this, you know?

1452
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,880
I think it's kinda slow.

1453
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,520
She's gonna try and grab you.

1454
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,640
She's gonna try and grab me.

1455
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,120
Where's my camera?

1456
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,670
Oh yeah lady.

1457
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:07,450
Oh yeah.

1458
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:08,930
Give me a good smile.

1459
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,030
Watch out!

1460
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:17,030
What are we doing?

1461
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:18,190
I'll show you.

1462
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,590
We're waiting.

1463
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:22,030
We're waiting.

1464
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:23,990
That's what we're doing.

1465
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,650
Hello ma'am.

1466
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,430
Why don't you put your arms out and try to give me a hug, huh?

1467
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,430
Where's my hug?

1468
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:35,270
There it is!

1469
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:38,750
She's...

1470
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:40,970
Where's my hug?

1471
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,770
Discord mod looking ass.

1472
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:44,810
Get out of here!

1473
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:59,310
We just gotta wait a couple of minutes guys.

1474
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:00,050
Don't worry.

1475
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:04,110
Run, run, run!

1476
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:08,950
Are you gonna... What if we listen to our favorite song?

1477
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:12,630
Screams are so overrated.

1478
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:16,370
We're not listening to Screamo here.

1479
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:18,590
We're listening to Oishii Touhan Seikatsu!

1480
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,700
It's the screaming.

1481
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,120
It's just so funny.

1482
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:41,100
Let's see if we can break all the glass in this place.

1483
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:47,800
Okay.

1484
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,720
All the glass I think.

1485
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,280
We did it ma'am.

1486
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,960
Just kidding, there's more.

1487
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,020
Down here too.

1488
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:57,760
Just kidding.

1489
01:43:58,540 --> 01:43:59,060
It's too early.

1490
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,340
Hurry up!

1491
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:04,040
She's so slow.

1492
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,040
So slow.

1493
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:17,850
The timing!

1494
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,550
Holy moly.

1495
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,790
Give me a smile honey.

1496
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:31,770
Okay, nevermind.

1497
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:34,150
She looks like the Joker over here.

1498
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:38,490
Looks like the Jo... Oh, I need more bullets.

1499
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,630
Let's see.

1500
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,430
Motion mag.

1501
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,380
I really don't need that much.

1502
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,380
Maybe like...

1503
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:03,580
One...

1504
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,120
More bullets.

1505
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,220
No more cries.

1506
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,860
Smile only.

1507
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,460
Oh yeah.

1508
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:16,140
Cheese!

1509
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,940
That was close.

1510
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,320
What about a dance?

1511
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,840
Give me a little dance honey.

1512
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:26,660
Oh, we forgot to put our song on.

1513
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,440
Dance for me!

1514
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,380
Oh, there she goes.

1515
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:05,930
Let's see if we can get another silly photo.

1516
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:07,830
That's not quite...

1517
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:08,850
Oh gosh.

1518
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:11,970
She really looks like the Joker a bit, huh?

1519
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:14,530
Oh man.

1520
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,490
Is that your blood down there?

1521
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,170
Oh no, those are my casings.

1522
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:23,430
Yeah.

1523
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,430
Oh yeah.

1524
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:42,870
Give me a smile.

1525
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:45,170
Oh yeah.

1526
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:07,320
That's how you play the game you guys.

1527
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,080
Haunted house sound effect.

1528
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,760
Return to baby.

1529
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:20,510
Little fetus.

1530
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:35,220
My controller is vibrating.

1531
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,640
My controller is vibrating.

1532
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:59,280
It's actually Psycho fetus!

1533
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:06,940
Yes.

1534
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:20,140
What do you know about me?

1535
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,380
What if I...

1536
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,880
What if I did find a way to play this on a Playstation?

1537
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:55,800
Even a PS2.

1538
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,040
Oh, putting my controller.

1539
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,500
I'll put it on my phone so you can hear it.

1540
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,560
Okay, it's on my phone.

1541
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:06,780
Yes.

1542
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:06,860
Yes.

1543
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,320
Oh it's really light.

1544
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,460
I don't think you can hear it.

1545
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:23,060
It's moving!

1546
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,060
Vibration is back baby!

1547
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:48,220
Vibration is back baby!

1548
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,480
Ripperoni.

1549
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:00,620
Sorrow!

1550
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:00,980
Sorrow!

1551
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:08,810
The sorrow saved us!

1552
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:16,010
Yes.

1553
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:17,390
Oh yeah.

1554
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:31,990
And that's why I was just like, oh it makes sense that he had the sorrow doll.

1555
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:36,250
I love how Mantis showed up just to show off again.

1556
01:50:36,410 --> 01:50:36,970
I know.

1557
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:55,950
Was it a missed opportunity that Meryl wasn't the last BMV?

1558
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:20,890
But then, if you don't beat her non-lethally, it kind of ruins the point.

1559
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:24,810
You wouldn't want to kill Meryl.

1560
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:31,230
It would make sense if the Otacon ending was canon.

1561
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:32,350
Yeah, that's true.

1562
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:32,470
Yeah.

1563
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:38,610
It was deck.

1564
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:44,130
That's how you get dysentery.

1565
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,170
And the dysentery.

1566
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:52,550
Yeah.

1567
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,390
It went to...

1568
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:40,570
The trickster is born.

1569
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:08,690
Bum bum.

1570
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:12,370
That's why she's...

1571
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:15,290
That's why she's discount Psycho Mantis.

1572
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:18,830
Having to use strings.

1573
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:38,730
She wasn't screaming that much.

1574
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:40,310
I think I was screaming more than her.

1575
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:46,410
I think I was screaming more than she was.

1576
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:50,030
We're fine.

1577
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:53,010
Yeah, bye Droven.

1578
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:55,830
Alright guys.

1579
01:53:59,110 --> 01:54:00,670
That was...

1580
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:03,930
That was the last BMV.

1581
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:07,290
I'm a secret member of BMV.

1582
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:15,000
Oh Meryl.

1583
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:16,960
Meryl, you good?

1584
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,600
Where did everybody else go?

1585
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,380
I don't care about the frogs.

1586
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:30,480
Oh that's right.

1587
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:31,920
Johnny was here too.

1588
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:34,040
Great question.

1589
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,280
Oh yeah.

1590
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,580
Johnny got shot like 5 times.

1591
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:44,940
Don't say who.

1592
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,960
I love Johnny.

1593
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,520
I like Johnny.

1594
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:53,600
Oh no Meryl.

1595
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,760
You're not gonna be able to get the banana.

1596
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:55,440
Banana.

1597
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,560
The bandana.

1598
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:07,340
I love this part.

1599
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,380
Everyone's just like, Snake it's our turn.

1600
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,520
It's our turn Snake.

1601
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,920
You've done so much for us.

1602
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,500
I love it.

1603
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,360
I love this part.

1604
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,920
Let him cook.

1605
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:40,680
Screaming Mindo.

1606
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,740
Whatever that means.

1607
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,780
On the other side of the hallway or on the other side in the afterlife.

1608
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,120
Oh Meryl.

1609
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,440
Oh Meryl.

1610
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:17,080
I think you're outnumbered.

1611
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:22,760
And out bulleted.

1612
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:28,080
Other side of the mission.

1613
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,580
Alright, so here...

1614
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:36,800
Welcome to where we would have farmed.

1615
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,560
Welcome to the farming zone.

1616
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,540
Welcome!

1617
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,460
No way.

1618
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,380
Yes way!

1619
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:00,580
I love this part though.

1620
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:14,920
Why don't we get somebody else?

1621
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,180
Infinite respawning.

1622
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:19,000
That's what I'm saying!

1623
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,500
That's what I'm saying!

1624
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:39,870
To be fair, Meryl dragged herself into this because...

1625
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,110
Go!

1626
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:55,440
It makes you so lag.

1627
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,160
Oh gosh.

1628
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:01,650
That whole...

1629
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:02,990
That whole scene.

1630
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,630
Oh gosh, Meryl!

1631
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:15,030
Okay, we just, we just, we just left.

1632
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:15,970
Okay, Meryl.

1633
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:19,990
Okay, Meryl.

1634
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:20,490
It's okay.

1635
01:58:24,490 --> 01:58:25,330
You're okay.

1636
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:26,490
No.

1637
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:28,030
Meryl, no!

1638
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:30,850
CQC!

1639
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,370
Why didn't we teach her CQC?

1640
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:35,970
Why didn't we teach her...

1641
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:44,500
Zombieman, welcome to membership.

1642
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,800
He made it!

1643
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,060
Look at that gun.

1644
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,420
Holy moly.

1645
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:52,920
Maybe run.

1646
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:57,620
Somehow.

1647
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:05,700
Kept you waiting, huh?

1648
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:23,420
I don't think it was clear.

1649
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:30,750
The dream team!

1650
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,100
Who needs aim anyway?

1651
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,960
This guy!

1652
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,640
Okay, that's so valid though.

1653
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:10,600
That's so valid.

1654
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,900
I would maybe do the same.

1655
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:26,780
He saved your life because he wasn't...

1656
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:30,960
Maybe...

1657
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:33,660
You could have, you could have, you could have thrown them at her, you know?

1658
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:40,400
They were warranted.

1659
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:43,800
Yeah.

1660
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:45,720
Oh yeah!

1661
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,440
Let's watch him shit his pants again!

1662
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,660
With his ass out!

1663
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:09,280
And he saw her ass too!

1664
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:30,700
The Mr. and Mrs. Smith moment.

1665
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:31,800
Real.

1666
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,320
Look at his face!

1667
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:36,800
He's loading a gun for her!

1668
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,980
Yeah, actually.

1669
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,980
He's the bottom in this relationship.

1670
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:01,400
Sure.

1671
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,840
Oh, that's a grenade.

1672
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:08,720
How

1673
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:14,020
do they have so many people?

1674
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,200
I love blooms on the battlefield.

1675
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,960
Oh my gosh, we're bleeding on top of each other.

1676
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:31,360
Don't even think about cheating on me.

1677
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:34,880
All the frogs, like, kinda looking at each other like...

1678
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,080
Are we interrupting?

1679
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:41,480
You guys are like seven wheeling right now.

1680
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,160
Give her a real wedding, Johnny!

1681
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,820
It's been my dream since I was a little girl.

1682
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,260
And then she had the psychotherapy.

1683
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,960
Whatever happened to that?

1684
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,960
Johnny better be thanking Snake with his entire being.

1685
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,180
That Snake broke the hypnotherapy.

1686
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:22,540
Her dream was to be a soldier.

1687
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,540
Clearly it wasn't.

1688
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,990
No,

1689
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,250
they can pass!

1690
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:49,630
Hold on, this is so awkward.

1691
02:03:50,170 --> 02:03:51,310
Wait, excuse me.

1692
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:56,550
So this is where we would have, like, you know...

1693
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:05,850
Farms and everything?

1694
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:08,530
Holy moly, my ears.

1695
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,470
Hold on, sorry, there we go.

1696
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:16,230
This is where we would have farmed and gotten lots and lots...

1697
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:19,430
And lots and lots of money.

1698
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:21,630
Let's just sit in here.

1699
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:24,430
Lots and lots of money.

1700
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:26,510
Getting lots and lots of money.

1701
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:29,430
Thank goodness we have the Patriot with unlimited ammo!

1702
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:33,710
Get that one right there.

1703
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:35,410
There we go.

1704
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:45,230
But alas, today...

1705
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,130
Let's see, how much do we got?

1706
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:52,030
I'm already at 54!

1707
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:55,010
I mean, but I got some of that from earlier too.

1708
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:56,950
I think it would have taken a long time.

1709
02:04:57,670 --> 02:04:59,610
Always can drop a save for future Minto to farm.

1710
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:02,990
Yeah, I feel I should, right?

1711
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:16,700
Because that's why I tried to do it before...

1712
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,660
And I didn't have a save.

1713
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,860
I didn't have a save, so I couldn't come back here so easily.

1714
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,140
I would have had to...

1715
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:28,280
Who's shooting me?

1716
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:31,620
Who's shooting me?

1717
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:37,800
I'm so tempted to just be like...

1718
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,620
You know, it's so tempting.

1719
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,360
You don't get a lot though.

1720
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:47,720
You only get 50 DP from these guys.

1721
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:52,460
But I mean, that adds up if you do a ton of them.

1722
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:58,640
At this point, we don't even need anything.

1723
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:02,420
We don't need the stealth camo.

1724
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,920
We don't need anything, you know?

1725
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:07,380
At this point, it's basically all over.

1726
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:15,180
We're just sitting here.

1727
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:19,720
Okay, let's see how much we get in like one minute.

1728
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,200
And then we can do the math.

1729
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:26,140
Somebody do a minute from right here.

1730
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:31,640
It's almost relaxing.

1731
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:33,380
I literally am just holding down.

1732
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,420
Time start.

1733
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,830
I was at 52.

1734
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:53,260
These are the things that were on the Lady and Raiden's game.

1735
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:54,440
They are, yes!

1736
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:55,720
It's the same thing.

1737
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:57,740
Yeah, who needs cookie clicker?

1738
02:06:58,220 --> 02:06:58,660
So true.

1739
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:01,200
This is the boss's will.

1740
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,480
Yeah, these are the little dwarf geckos that are...

1741
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,640
That are referenced in Rising, yeah.

1742
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:18,970
Do you guys like Patriot ASMR?

1743
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:24,340
Oh, it's probably been a minute, right?

1744
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:24,800
Oh shoot.

1745
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:26,700
What are we at?

1746
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:29,740
55.

1747
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:35,230
We're at 55.

1748
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:44,510
So...

1749
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:47,970
It's better than I was expecting.

1750
02:07:48,870 --> 02:07:50,050
I think it would be...

1751
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:58,150
It might take like...

1752
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:00,910
Yeah, like 10k a minute.

1753
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,800
No, a little more.

1754
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,480
No, not 10k.

1755
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:11,820
Because we were at 52.

1756
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,060
Now we're at 55.

1757
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,340
It would take a little bit of time.

1758
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,200
It would take a little bit of time, huh?

1759
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,640
Yeah, just a little bit.

1760
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,480
Oh, I was at 54?

1761
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,360
Oh, just kidding.

1762
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,360
Alright, let's keep going.

1763
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:41,840
Wait for me!

1764
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:46,740
We're rolling, rolling.

1765
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:49,880
Like we're Katamari Damashii.

1766
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:52,340
Katamari Damashii.

1767
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:02,380
Oh, I'm not even running anymore.

1768
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:02,900
There we go.

1769
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,420
Yay!

1770
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:10,500
Okay.

1771
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:17,460
Oh, snake.

1772
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:20,060
I don't think he's doing so hot, you guys.

1773
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:23,560
Snake, you're okay, buddy?

1774
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:33,540
Snake...

1775
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:38,620
Oh my god, why are there gonna be froggies here?

1776
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:38,840
Snake!

1777
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:43,260
She's like, hold.

1778
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,320
We don't even have to do anything to this guy.

1779
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:45,940
He's so pathetic.

1780
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:51,280
Knife fight.

1781
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,660
This is so messed up.

1782
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,960
Oh my god, snake is at his lowest of low.

1783
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,260
It's so bad.

1784
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:34,520
It's so bad.

1785
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:42,660
Oh my god.

1786
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,680
Raiden!

1787
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:51,780
He's got no arms.

1788
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:58,380
Where

1789
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:06,260
is that power in rising?

1790
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:12,660
Where is the power to electrify people with my brain?

1791
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,080
Everyone's coming.

1792
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:18,920
Everyone's here.

1793
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:20,300
Everyone's coming together.

1794
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,760
My sword is a tool of justice.

1795
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:37,530
How are you doing that?

1796
02:11:39,790 --> 02:11:41,250
How are you doing that?

1797
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:42,470
Oh my god.

1798
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:43,470
Excuse me?

1799
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:50,770
No.

1800
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,390
Don't steal my glory.

1801
02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,850
You're a robot, Raiden.

1802
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:01,390
You won't make it.

1803
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:20,710
Oh my god.

1804
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:22,210
You have a baby!

1805
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:24,090
You have a kid!

1806
02:12:26,570 --> 02:12:27,210
You

1807
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:32,920
still have your youth.

1808
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:35,720
Don't waste it.

1809
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,020
You can start over.

1810
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:43,440
From here on, this is my fight.

1811
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:48,300
We tore the world apart.

1812
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,200
Made your life a living hell.

1813
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:55,240
How is that a spoiler?

1814
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:58,380
She was literally pregnant at the end of 2, you guys.

1815
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:03,280
It's my duty to put an end to all of this.

1816
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:07,840
Alright.

1817
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:10,860
I'll make sure they don't get through.

1818
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:13,580
Kind of the frogs to let them act out a ton of violence.

1819
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:16,600
Hold on until we insert the virus.

1820
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:42,970
I like how Otacon is just like...

1821
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:47,810
Yeah, the frogs are just chilling.

1822
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:52,550
They could have done...actually they did the same for Meryl and Johnny.

1823
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:54,470
Just let them talk it out.

1824
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:58,750
Oh my gosh.

1825
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:02,390
Where did these all...where did they come from?

1826
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:08,150
I guess that means that Meryl and Johnny failed.

1827
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:23,290
Thank you...snake.

1828
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:33,670
It's my fault because I didn't kill any of them but they all woke up.

1829
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:39,350
Yeah, I didn't kill any of the frogs so they're all waking up and coming here.

1830
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:44,010
I think you need that, right?

1831
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:45,590
To like fight.

1832
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:52,570
It's me when I pick stuff off the ground with my feet.

1833
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:08,410
It's like he's meditating.

1834
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:11,650
They're so patient.

1835
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:13,770
Why did they throw away their guns?

1836
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,380
Oh gosh.

1837
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,960
No, I don't want it to happen!

1838
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,480
Come

1839
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:59,060
on snake!

1840
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:04,500
Oh snake!

1841
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:13,040
Come on snake!

1842
02:16:18,330 --> 02:16:21,070
Oh god, his health going down.

1843
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:31,710
Come on snake!

1844
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:34,830
Come on snake!

1845
02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:41,330
Come on snake!

1846
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:49,270
I'm mashing!

1847
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:50,930
I'm mashing!

1848
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:07,440
Just one more hallway.

1849
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,260
Just one more hallway please!

1850
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:28,280
Everyone is doing their best.

1851
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,920
I'm going!

1852
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:35,540
I'm going!

1853
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:52,100
I'm mashing!

1854
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:52,640
I'm mashing!

1855
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:56,460
Oh my god Rose, jump scare.

1856
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:03,720
You're almost there.

1857
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:05,160
You're almost there snake!

1858
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:10,260
Oh my god!

1859
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,360
Sunny!

1860
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,520
She cooked them perfectly.

1861
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:30,700
Look at her dancing.

1862
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:33,040
Do it for Sunny!

1863
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:48,010
I'm smashing!

1864
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:27,410
Imagine it opens up and there's more.

1865
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:31,230
Okay,

1866
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:51,390
he's done burning on that side.

1867
02:19:51,470 --> 02:19:54,290
You have to flip him over so that he can burn on the other side.

1868
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:57,790
You can't let him get too burnt on one side.

1869
02:19:58,650 --> 02:20:00,190
He's like the eggs now.

1870
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,710
This is GW.

1871
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:18,840
It's like a graveyard in here.

1872
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,980
Not those flowers.

1873
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:26,620
Leave it to me.

1874
02:20:32,310 --> 02:20:33,810
Petals of white.

1875
02:20:46,550 --> 02:20:50,610
Honestly, I actually don't understand why snake had to be here.

1876
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,300
I don't quite understand it.

1877
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:58,980
Why couldn't Otacon just take the MK3 and go?

1878
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,820
The sensors?

1879
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:15,800
Maybe that's it.

1880
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,080
MK3 couldn't reach the door, no?

1881
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:20,920
Oh my god.

1882
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:22,680
That's not good.

1883
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:39,180
I guess for this purpose, huh?

1884
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:41,760
Gotta protect it.

1885
02:21:49,650 --> 02:21:51,770
Snake, turn your aimbot on!

1886
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:56,790
That was so fast.

1887
02:21:57,130 --> 02:21:57,510
Raiden!

1888
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:58,190
Raiden!

1889
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:05,290
He instantly folded.

1890
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:10,230
Oh my gosh.

1891
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:12,790
Oh my gosh.

1892
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:13,710
Scooch faster!

1893
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:24,040
Why'd you drop it?

1894
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:29,630
Oh my god.

1895
02:22:29,890 --> 02:22:32,430
They were scared of you for two seconds and then you dropped it.

1896
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:36,110
No!

1897
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:57,930
It's so sad.

1898
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:02,150
Oh my god.

1899
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,670
Snake,

1900
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:17,210
shoot!

1901
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:17,830
Just shoot!

1902
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,460
Oh my god.

1903
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,180
Just shoot!

1904
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:24,980
Just shoot!

1905
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:33,980
No!

1906
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,920
Imagine if they had me play this part.

1907
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,720
And it kicks in...

1908
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:55,080
No!

1909
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:57,280
No!

1910
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,280
Oh, there it is.

1911
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:11,360
We did it!

1912
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:24,010
What?

1913
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:31,070
Take her down.

1914
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,750
Take her down.

1915
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:35,550
Oh my gosh.

1916
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:36,690
The sounds are so...

1917
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:38,510
Poor baby.

1918
02:24:39,370 --> 02:24:40,530
She's such a baby.

1919
02:24:50,290 --> 02:24:51,010
Imagine.

1920
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:52,410
Oh my gosh.

1921
02:24:52,430 --> 02:24:54,050
It's such a Jurassic Park moment.

1922
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:55,990
It's so scary.

1923
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:58,010
That's so scary.

1924
02:24:58,150 --> 02:24:58,550
Imagine.

1925
02:24:59,770 --> 02:25:04,470
You look out the window and see Ray screaming at you.

1926
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,440
Oh there it is.

1927
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:30,100
Oh my gosh.

1928
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:34,020
Hi Raiders!

1929
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,320
If you never played Metal Gear...

1930
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:38,280
These are like crazy.

1931
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:40,900
We are at the last part of the last game.

1932
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:43,460
So these are like crazy, crazy spoilers.

1933
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:44,880
War Cry!

1934
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:47,360
Thank you for the Ray!

1935
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:48,520
Oh my gosh.

1936
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:51,900
But also if you intend on playing these games...

1937
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:57,400
Thank you!

1938
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:58,040
War Cry!

1939
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:03,480
Oh boy.

1940
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:04,920
Sorry, I'm about to get angry.

1941
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:16,660
Never played?

1942
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:17,620
Oh my gosh.

1943
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:19,660
It's too emotional.

1944
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,640
Oh, she's got a plaster of her face everywhere.

1945
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:28,980
I'm so glad I could see you sing Snake Eater.

1946
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:30,300
I'm so happy.

1947
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,660
I was the loudest one in that room.

1948
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:38,600
Oh my god.

1949
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:44,880
I hope you're listening.

1950
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:50,030
Doesn't even address Otacon.

1951
02:26:50,330 --> 02:26:56,730
The virus you uploaded is using GW as a conduit to annihilate the entire AI network.

1952
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:05,130
It's set to destroy all four AIs along with JD, the core that tied them all together.

1953
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:09,870
I've set this video to play back once they're all gone.

1954
02:27:12,270 --> 02:27:14,270
Oh my god.

1955
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:29,570
Naomi.mp4

1956
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,600
A little.

1957
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:40,260
Okay.

1958
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:46,760
This child prodigy.

1959
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:51,600
Look at her.

1960
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:52,920
She's so worried.

1961
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:55,040
Sweet baby.

1962
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:55,380
Sweet baby.

1963
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:06,940
Fox is alive.

1964
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:14,100
That means Sunny is the anti-Naomi.

1965
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,960
Truly the bestest character ever.

1966
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:21,160
The best character.

1967
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:22,120
Sunny.

1968
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,360
The music.

1969
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:55,910
Don't cry for her.

1970
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,060
Yeah, you should be.

1971
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,680
You should be.

1972
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:09,860
Yeah, you should be.

1973
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:26,300
You?

1974
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:28,140
You had everything.

1975
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:32,440
You had many chances, Naomi.

1976
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:36,360
And yet...

1977
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,160
In the end...

1978
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:42,940
You helped me feel the joy of living.

1979
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:47,970
Thank you, Hal.

1980
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:52,510
Thank you.

1981
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:57,070
Hal.

1982
02:29:59,110 --> 02:30:01,850
The way she says his name there!

1983
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:01,970
Look at her.

1984
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:11,490
Look at how she's dramatically looking into the sea.

1985
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:16,170
She's wiping away her tears like, I'm the main character.

1986
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:17,250
I'm doing all this.

1987
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:20,290
Oh my gosh, it's me.

1988
02:30:21,430 --> 02:30:22,530
Everybody's gonna love me.

1989
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:41,270
Rising.

1990
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:46,050
Now, she can build a new destiny for herself.

1991
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:49,830
Snake.

1992
02:30:52,110 --> 02:30:54,310
The time has come.

1993
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:02,830
You've earned your rest.

1994
02:31:02,830 --> 02:31:03,090
Snake.

1995
02:31:04,110 --> 02:31:08,810
The rose petal is about to fall.

1996
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:19,950
Snake?

1997
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:23,050
Snake!

1998
02:31:25,330 --> 02:31:26,030
Snake!

1999
02:31:48,290 --> 02:31:49,590
Fringe killed him.

2000
02:31:50,470 --> 02:31:52,150
Naomi does that to me too.

2001
02:31:54,350 --> 02:31:58,930
If I weren't already dead, Naomi would've killed me a hundred times over.

2002
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:05,060
Here it is, everybody.

2003
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:08,860
Not a con!

2004
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:10,000
Not a con!

2005
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:13,060
Not a con!

2006
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:21,710
Where did he go?

2007
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:26,840
Like, where are you getting this medic?

2008
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:34,240
Gotta equip pneumonia whenever Naomi speaks.

2009
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:38,440
That's how I react to Naomi.

2010
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:40,180
Fucking two!

2011
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:43,100
Oh, golly gee.

2012
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:48,100
I hope you guys didn't forget about the best character in the whole game!

2013
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:54,360
Oh my, how did he get him up there?

2014
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:55,840
So many mysteries.

2015
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:58,560
You could've stopped us.

2016
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,180
I stopped you.

2017
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:03,820
Why would I want to do that?

2018
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:08,420
This is just as I'd hoped things would end.

2019
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:11,880
Back before father's time.

2020
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:15,000
Before Zero gave birth to the Patriots.

2021
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:21,500
The US, China and the Soviet Union formed a secret pact.

2022
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,220
All according to plan.

2023
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:29,320
The organization they created was called the Philosophers.

2024
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:33,180
Through two world wars it spread its roots and extended its reach.

2025
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:39,300
After that the Philosophers splintered and factions began to squabble over the fortune in the past.

2026
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:42,120
They called it the Philosophers Legacy.

2027
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:47,660
A massive cash of funds that would later provide the foundation for Zero's Patriots.

2028
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:52,360
Zero sought to use his riches to achieve world domination.

2029
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:57,800
Our father, Big Boss, sought to free himself from that chokehold.

2030
02:33:58,340 --> 02:34:01,020
His dream was to create an army of free citizens.

2031
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:03,360
One that answered to no government.

2032
02:34:04,220 --> 02:34:05,200
Outer Heaven.

2033
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:10,280
But he failed because of you.

2034
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:14,320
Nine years ago I tried to free us from the control of machines.

2035
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:17,940
Four years later our dear brother...

2036
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:20,640
Was that... was that liquid from Twin Snakes?

2037
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:27,440
All of that, all of it, was nothing more than a process of trial and error.

2038
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:30,120
The end result of which is Outer Heaven.

2039
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:33,460
To be free from funds of the Patriots.

2040
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:38,180
The ultimate form of external control imposed on the Patriots soldiers.

2041
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:43,520
The memes control us now.

2042
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:47,080
The end result of which is Outer Heaven.

2043
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:49,020
Free from FOXDIE.

2044
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:51,360
Free from the system.

2045
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:53,240
Free from ID control.

2046
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:54,420
Snake is so done.

2047
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,440
Our minds free from their prisons.

2048
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:04,280
That is the haven I've yearned for.

2049
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,000
In his lap.

2050
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,380
One more.

2051
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:27,480
Got his neck.

2052
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,920
You'll have a score to settle.

2053
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:59,660
Yes we do.

2054
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,740
Oh my god.

2055
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:09,820
Show me what you've got, Snake!

2056
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:52,620
Oh my gosh, the arm.

2057
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:54,500
The arm of liquid.

2058
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:28,990
We're coming up on peak.

2059
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:31,290
It's already peak, but oh gosh.

2060
02:37:31,970 --> 02:37:33,830
Oh my god, oh my god.

2061
02:37:34,770 --> 02:37:36,270
He's ruthless.

2062
02:37:37,690 --> 02:37:39,190
His nose.

2063
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:42,370
Everything is broken.

2064
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:42,610
Again.

2065
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:49,470
I like how Liquid also wears an office name badge.

2066
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:55,010
He's like, no, give me that.

2067
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:57,570
No, give me that.

2068
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,640
Don't share needles, kids.

2069
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:08,380
Don't do that.

2070
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:11,940
Liquid!

2071
02:38:18,210 --> 02:38:19,710
Oh my god.

2072
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:36,560
Good.

2073
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:41,380
Not by the bandana.

2074
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:43,980
Not by the bandana, that's

2075
02:38:52,460 --> 02:38:52,960
so...

2076
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:53,460
Brothers.

2077
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:05,890
Coming in pretty geared up for that.

2078
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:13,110
Oh

2079
02:39:23,310 --> 02:39:24,590
my god.

2080
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:25,910
Oh my gosh.

2081
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:29,230
The

2082
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:51,010
life bars!

2083
02:40:04,810 --> 02:40:05,670
Nice

2084
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:38,010
of him to let me...

2085
02:40:38,010 --> 02:40:38,810
Ouchie, ouchie.

2086
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:39,550
Stop it.

2087
02:40:39,650 --> 02:40:39,750
Stop.

2088
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:43,810
Give

2089
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:19,440
me that.

2090
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:20,580
Ouch,

2091
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:25,230
I'll jump stuff.

2092
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:27,410
Ouchie, ouch.

2093
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:31,030
Snake.

2094
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:35,730
Right behind you.

2095
02:41:35,890 --> 02:41:37,650
You are literally in front of me.

2096
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:48,470
Next part.

2097
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:50,190
Next part.

2098
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,190
Ouchie, ouch.

2099
02:42:13,870 --> 02:42:14,610
Ouchie, ouch.

2100
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:10,420
One of the greatest battles in gaming history, you guys!

2101
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:11,240
Oh my gosh.

2102
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,180
Get up, Snake.

2103
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,740
Oh god, I took a...

2104
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:15,220
I should have dodged that.

2105
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:21,920
Good job, Snake.

2106
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:23,120
Good job, good job.

2107
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:31,040
Don't worry, I'm ready for...

2108
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:32,940
The next part.

2109
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:35,780
But I'm not ready.

2110
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:37,160
I'm not ready.

2111
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:42,600
I'm not ready.

2112
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:05,870
Oh god.

2113
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:11,130
I can't...

2114
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:19,830
Wait, how do I get him close to me?

2115
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:24,890
There we go.

2116
02:44:24,890 --> 02:44:25,990
What?

2117
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:31,970
Snake.

2118
02:44:46,290 --> 02:44:47,650
Oh shit.

2119
02:44:48,030 --> 02:44:49,690
Oh god, I'm gonna die here.

2120
02:44:49,970 --> 02:44:51,710
I can't concentrate at all.

2121
02:45:05,770 --> 02:45:07,170
No!

2122
02:45:16,450 --> 02:45:17,310
Ouch!

2123
02:45:26,490 --> 02:45:27,890
No!

2124
02:45:29,970 --> 02:45:31,370
Ouch.

2125
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:39,590
Ouch, ouch.

2126
02:45:46,450 --> 02:45:47,150
Ouch.

2127
02:45:48,470 --> 02:45:48,910
Yeah.

2128
02:45:56,590 --> 02:45:57,430
No!

2129
02:45:58,410 --> 02:45:59,250
Oops,

2130
02:46:03,380 --> 02:46:04,160
I missed it.

2131
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:04,680
Ouch!

2132
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:06,260
I missed it.

2133
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:06,440
Ouch.

2134
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:10,240
I missed it.

2135
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:29,900
Not over yet.

2136
02:47:16,990 --> 02:47:18,390
No.

2137
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:26,330
Remember who you are.

2138
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:06,800
The last beauty.

2139
02:48:07,470 --> 02:48:08,400
It's true.

2140
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:11,060
No.

2141
02:48:18,470 --> 02:48:19,880
I can't.

2142
02:48:19,980 --> 02:48:21,080
It's too good.

2143
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:26,040
It's too good every time.

2144
02:48:35,380 --> 02:48:37,120
It's true though.

2145
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:41,520
No.

2146
02:49:10,660 --> 02:49:11,120
No.

2147
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,400
Traumatic spin.

2148
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:16,140
He's so stupid.

2149
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:21,100
You didn't have to be on your back.

2150
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:29,460
This guy.

2151
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:51,680
No.

2152
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,400
No.

2153
02:50:16,860 --> 02:50:18,260
No.

2154
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:32,840
So dramatic.

2155
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:54,240
What took you so long?

2156
02:50:55,220 --> 02:51:00,270
Was the medic on the toilet or something?

2157
02:51:14,510 --> 02:51:15,190
Yeah,

2158
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:21,350
he didn't want to interrupt Peek.

2159
02:51:22,810 --> 02:51:23,850
No.

2160
02:51:36,410 --> 02:51:37,830
That's me right?

2161
02:51:37,950 --> 02:51:38,490
I need that.

2162
02:51:39,190 --> 02:51:41,510
I need that kind of comfort.

2163
02:51:45,010 --> 02:51:45,190
Sunny.

2164
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:49,250
Sunny.

2165
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:53,210
No.

2166
02:51:58,190 --> 02:52:02,270
God, Snake goes through the most in this damn act.

2167
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:25,610
I wonder if we did the right thing.

2168
02:52:27,710 --> 02:52:28,350
Naomi.

2169
02:52:28,990 --> 02:52:30,150
No, don't think of her.

2170
02:52:30,990 --> 02:52:32,430
What did we lose?

2171
02:52:34,670 --> 02:52:36,390
You lost your virginity.

2172
02:52:36,990 --> 02:52:37,570
Sorry.

2173
02:52:37,790 --> 02:52:38,250
No, sorry.

2174
02:52:38,730 --> 02:52:39,130
Sorry.

2175
02:52:47,660 --> 02:52:49,040
Not now Otacon.

2176
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:53,520
Okay, we are about to go into movie mode.

2177
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:54,860
Sorry.

2178
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:56,520
Oh, jeez.

2179
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:57,240
I'm okay.

2180
02:52:57,660 --> 02:52:59,240
We are about to go into movie mode.

2181
02:53:00,140 --> 02:53:01,280
That was it.

2182
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:03,580
That was it of the gameplay everybody.

2183
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:04,440
Isn't that crazy?

2184
02:53:13,580 --> 02:53:14,860
Let's save the game.

2185
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:18,020
I'm going to go party real quick.

2186
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:18,060
I'm going to go party real quick.

2187
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:29,680
We'll save and then we shall... So, give me, like, maybe...

2188
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:33,320
Wait, is it going to... Wait, do I need to pause?

2189
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:33,860
Hold on.

2190
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:34,520
Uh-oh.

2191
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:35,180
Wait a second.

2192
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:36,640
Wait!

2193
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:37,420
Oh no!

2194
02:53:47,080 --> 02:53:47,560
Wait.

2195
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:48,520
Wait!

2196
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:50,140
Okay.

2197
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:50,700
Okay.

2198
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:51,020
Okay.

2199
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:51,600
Alright.

2200
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:52,160
Alright.

2201
02:53:52,260 --> 02:53:52,680
Alright.

2202
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:57,880
Everybody, party break.

2203
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:02,140
Party break because we got more to go through.

2204
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:04,520
And there is more.

2205
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:06,100
There is more.

2206
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,520
Break time.

2207
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:09,340
Get your popcorn.

2208
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:10,700
Get your drinks.

2209
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:15,240
I'm okay.

2210
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:17,940
I'm not okay, but I'm okay.

2211
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:19,300
No!

2212
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:22,880
Okay.

2213
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:24,020
No, BRB.

2214
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:03,940
I'm back.

2215
02:57:05,240 --> 02:57:06,100
No, I'm back.

2216
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:07,760
I'm back.

2217
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:08,200
I'm back.

2218
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:08,820
I'm back.

2219
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:18,020
For those... Do you guys understand why I love Ocelot so much?

2220
02:57:20,180 --> 02:57:23,420
Do you guys understand why I love Ocelot so much?

2221
02:57:23,480 --> 02:57:24,040
That man...

2222
02:57:24,740 --> 02:57:31,720
That man basically... He got made fun of and it changed his brain chemistry.

2223
02:57:32,540 --> 02:57:35,040
He was like... He was like...

2224
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:41,280
He got... He got infantilized once and then was just like...

2225
02:57:41,880 --> 02:57:42,320
You know what?

2226
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:44,040
Then I'm going to...

2227
02:57:44,860 --> 02:57:46,260
You made fun of me.

2228
02:57:46,320 --> 02:57:48,700
I'm going to make the whole world suffer.

2229
02:57:48,700 --> 02:57:49,440
The pure...

2230
02:57:56,220 --> 02:57:58,140
The pure love of the game.

2231
02:57:58,240 --> 02:58:01,300
The pure love of Big Boss.

2232
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:06,420
He was like... I'm going to do all this.

2233
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:08,680
Oh my god.

2234
02:58:21,570 --> 02:58:22,130
Okay.

2235
02:58:22,670 --> 02:58:23,390
Are you guys ready?

2236
02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:23,970
I'm not ready.

2237
02:58:23,970 --> 02:58:24,070
Okay.

2238
02:58:26,050 --> 02:58:27,090
Let's go.

2239
02:58:30,230 --> 02:58:31,510
Remind me later.

2240
02:58:33,730 --> 02:58:34,930
Epilogue time.

2241
02:58:35,250 --> 02:58:36,790
Remind me later and I'll sing you happy birthday.

2242
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:55,020
Oh my god.

2243
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:57,820
She's a bride!

2244
02:58:58,700 --> 02:59:01,780
Oh my

2245
02:59:06,890 --> 02:59:07,090
god.

2246
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:08,110
Campbell jumpscare.

2247
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:14,810
I don't like that hair on her though.

2248
02:59:14,850 --> 02:59:15,450
The hair stuff.

2249
02:59:17,390 --> 02:59:19,710
I guess back then hair bumps were kind of in, right?

2250
02:59:20,530 --> 02:59:21,490
When this game was made.

2251
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:34,940
Hair is kind of goofy.

2252
02:59:36,420 --> 02:59:37,760
She looks like a princess.

2253
02:59:43,380 --> 02:59:43,980
Damn.

2254
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:06,500
I even hold it up if you're not going to go through with it.

2255
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:15,600
Yeah, do what you want.

2256
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:18,560
Totally called her bluff.

2257
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:30,640
You've got a chance to win me over.

2258
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:32,260
I'm mad with a dad.

2259
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:36,800
Well,

2260
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:41,440
you're pretty old.

2261
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,240
I wouldn't say plenty.

2262
03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:45,760
Oh, yeah, sorry.

2263
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:46,280
I'm sorry.

2264
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:47,740
Thank you.

2265
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:52,580
She's so cute.

2266
03:00:55,800 --> 03:00:56,360
Meryl.

2267
03:00:58,280 --> 03:01:00,100
You look beautiful.

2268
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,560
Look at the highlighter she uses.

2269
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:06,200
All over her body.

2270
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:10,140
I'm hiding her beefy arms.

2271
03:01:11,180 --> 03:01:12,300
Sorry.

2272
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:18,950
No!

2273
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:24,720
Happy wedding day.

2274
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:24,760
Okay.

2275
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:31,800
Yeah, get a dress that shows off your arms.

2276
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:36,020
Why Johnny fell in love with you?

2277
03:01:44,910 --> 03:01:47,570
Oh my god, why would you give him a white tux?

2278
03:01:47,870 --> 03:01:51,050
This man, you would give him something white to wear?

2279
03:01:51,590 --> 03:01:52,070
No.

2280
03:01:56,560 --> 03:01:57,520
Absolutely not.

2281
03:01:57,520 --> 03:01:59,380
A little sentence.

2282
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:22,840
Eating popcorn at the wedding.

2283
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:26,660
I'm missing somebody.

2284
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:34,360
Pray.

2285
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,960
Or clean bowel movements.

2286
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:42,860
A new team on their first mission.

2287
03:02:46,870 --> 03:02:47,660
We're giggling.

2288
03:02:53,790 --> 03:02:55,080
He's like what the hell?

2289
03:03:06,830 --> 03:03:09,000
Oh my god Trevon.

2290
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:13,440
That's who we were missing.

2291
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:17,540
That's who we were missing.

2292
03:03:18,330 --> 03:03:18,700
A

2293
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:24,700
shower of flowers.

2294
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:26,320
Compliments of Drebin.

2295
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:33,820
A little something extra for me.

2296
03:03:42,810 --> 03:03:46,650
Sunny C meeting another human being for the first time.

2297
03:03:46,770 --> 03:03:48,210
Why is this kid here anyway?

2298
03:03:48,210 --> 03:03:48,370
Why?

2299
03:03:53,730 --> 03:03:58,110
Sunny meeting a person her age for the first time actually.

2300
03:04:03,870 --> 03:04:05,170
Oh my god.

2301
03:04:08,090 --> 03:04:13,330
The monkey has a nicotine addiction, caffeine addiction and is an alcoholic.

2302
03:04:26,950 --> 03:04:27,670
Sunny!

2303
03:04:27,930 --> 03:04:28,550
That's me too.

2304
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:31,430
Me too Sunny.

2305
03:04:34,990 --> 03:04:38,250
The bouquet.

2306
03:04:44,030 --> 03:04:47,090
Let Mayling get the bouquet!

2307
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:53,760
Where

2308
03:04:57,140 --> 03:04:59,100
is Snake?

2309
03:05:07,780 --> 03:05:09,180
Come

2310
03:05:21,210 --> 03:05:22,910
on Snake.

2311
03:05:26,570 --> 03:05:28,730
Guy always keeps you waiting.

2312
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:33,410
She

2313
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:41,570
was a bride just like she wanted.

2314
03:05:42,870 --> 03:05:44,230
Just like she wanted.

2315
03:05:51,650 --> 03:05:54,430
Who could this be?

2316
03:05:55,950 --> 03:05:57,170
Oh boy.

2317
03:05:58,410 --> 03:06:01,130
He's in his...oh I thought he was in his undies.

2318
03:06:03,450 --> 03:06:04,890
Thank goodness.

2319
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:09,150
Mr. Raiden.

2320
03:06:10,450 --> 03:06:11,470
You have a visitor.

2321
03:06:11,470 --> 03:06:11,730
Poor.

2322
03:06:38,250 --> 03:06:42,290
What is...the thing is beeping but it's not hooked up to him at all actually.

2323
03:06:43,650 --> 03:06:44,630
I just realized.

2324
03:06:47,390 --> 03:06:47,870
Virgil.

2325
03:06:50,050 --> 03:06:51,190
It really is.

2326
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:52,630
It does look just like Virgil.

2327
03:06:55,170 --> 03:06:55,730
Oh my god.

2328
03:06:55,790 --> 03:06:57,130
He's a little baby Virgil.

2329
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:00,770
Is it wifi?

2330
03:07:01,110 --> 03:07:01,490
Oh ok.

2331
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:02,670
Because he's a robot.

2332
03:07:13,310 --> 03:07:14,630
He's like what is that thing.

2333
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:20,040
Raiden!

2334
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:24,880
This is so classic.

2335
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:27,880
This is so classic Raiden and Rose.

2336
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:31,240
Oh my god.

2337
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:31,300
Raiden.

2338
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:35,760
I miss these days.

2339
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:43,140
Look at the boy.

2340
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:44,560
Use your special eyes.

2341
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:46,360
Not the kid in the mirror.

2342
03:07:47,020 --> 03:07:48,340
He's like why am I here?

2343
03:07:49,140 --> 03:07:49,900
What's going on?

2344
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:53,040
No.

2345
03:07:57,020 --> 03:07:57,560
Really?

2346
03:07:57,800 --> 03:07:59,300
You think that kid looks like Campbell?

2347
03:08:05,220 --> 03:08:06,320
So immediate.

2348
03:08:06,500 --> 03:08:07,000
So fast.

2349
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:18,580
Oh yeah she did say that didn't she?

2350
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:21,920
Oh my god.

2351
03:08:22,300 --> 03:08:23,780
She did say that.

2352
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:25,080
Yeah you lied.

2353
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:30,380
I also lied about that.

2354
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:32,220
Caused you a lot of trauma.

2355
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:36,140
Oh my god.

2356
03:08:38,320 --> 03:08:39,280
Rose.

2357
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:41,200
Girl you're the best to ever do it.

2358
03:08:52,890 --> 03:08:54,910
Oh my god.

2359
03:08:56,450 --> 03:09:02,390
Rose is the definition of gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss.

2360
03:09:07,330 --> 03:09:10,290
But you're too unstable Raiden.

2361
03:09:10,410 --> 03:09:10,850
I'm sorry.

2362
03:09:14,040 --> 03:09:15,610
This kid, he's here.

2363
03:09:17,130 --> 03:09:17,610
Speak.

2364
03:09:19,550 --> 03:09:20,070
John.

2365
03:09:21,290 --> 03:09:22,270
Hello.

2366
03:09:25,570 --> 03:09:26,330
My name's Virgil.

2367
03:09:32,230 --> 03:09:34,190
My son.

2368
03:09:42,380 --> 03:09:43,180
Sorry.

2369
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:47,040
Oh my god.

2370
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:49,520
It's like Frankenstein moving at him.

2371
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:53,740
I would be too.

2372
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:56,120
Oh my god he's got such glistening eyes.

2373
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:57,680
He's got his father's eyelashes.

2374
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:01,300
Little John.

2375
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:05,820
John Raiden.

2376
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:14,200
I think you're cool.

2377
03:10:14,580 --> 03:10:16,460
Kinda like a comic book superhero.

2378
03:10:20,420 --> 03:10:21,680
Okay little John.

2379
03:10:21,780 --> 03:10:22,720
That's enough talking.

2380
03:10:28,710 --> 03:10:30,070
I'm not scared.

2381
03:10:30,510 --> 03:10:32,150
You're like a comic book superhero.

2382
03:10:37,030 --> 03:10:38,130
My son.

2383
03:10:38,650 --> 03:10:40,030
I'll never abandon you.

2384
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:42,110
Until rising.

2385
03:10:43,630 --> 03:10:45,170
I'm done running.

2386
03:10:46,010 --> 03:10:46,350
For now.

2387
03:10:54,830 --> 03:10:57,770
I love this part of the ending so much.

2388
03:11:00,830 --> 03:11:02,410
This kid is so awkward.

2389
03:11:03,570 --> 03:11:05,470
He literally says two things.

2390
03:11:07,210 --> 03:11:08,610
And then just stares.

2391
03:11:08,610 --> 03:11:08,730
Stares.

2392
03:11:14,410 --> 03:11:15,470
I'm done lying.

2393
03:11:15,770 --> 03:11:16,570
Oh just kidding.

2394
03:11:16,890 --> 03:11:17,390
She's not.

2395
03:11:19,470 --> 03:11:21,750
I'm done lying to you.

2396
03:11:24,290 --> 03:11:26,150
And that was a lie.

2397
03:11:30,490 --> 03:11:31,770
Oh papa.

2398
03:11:32,330 --> 03:11:32,690
Papa!

2399
03:11:33,730 --> 03:11:34,390
Oh papa!

2400
03:11:35,290 --> 03:11:36,510
Oh happy family.

2401
03:11:39,510 --> 03:11:41,390
She's never done lying.

2402
03:11:43,250 --> 03:11:46,830
Oh gosh I love this goofy terrible family.

2403
03:11:47,590 --> 03:11:50,570
I love this horrible dynamic.

2404
03:11:51,610 --> 03:11:54,410
You guys have filled me with so much.

2405
03:11:55,110 --> 03:11:57,470
So much entertainment.

2406
03:11:58,950 --> 03:12:00,290
Look at them.

2407
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:09,370
I didn't say that.

2408
03:12:11,230 --> 03:12:13,450
I wasn't talking about me.

2409
03:12:36,410 --> 03:12:37,790
Go Rose!

2410
03:12:40,890 --> 03:12:42,490
And I'm the beauty.

2411
03:12:43,350 --> 03:12:44,750
What an egotistical woman.

2412
03:12:45,970 --> 03:12:48,610
At that very moment he was just thinking.

2413
03:12:48,770 --> 03:12:49,090
He was like.

2414
03:12:49,650 --> 03:12:50,830
I was right thinking that.

2415
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:53,610
I wasn't talking about you being the beauty.

2416
03:12:55,130 --> 03:12:58,470
I was so right to think of you as an egotistical woman.

2417
03:13:01,410 --> 03:13:03,050
He's just staring at her like.

2418
03:13:03,490 --> 03:13:05,810
Where the hell did you get that idea from?

2419
03:13:07,930 --> 03:13:10,690
Oh gosh I love them.

2420
03:13:11,370 --> 03:13:12,250
Okay back to tears.

2421
03:13:13,590 --> 03:13:14,890
Okay serious.

2422
03:13:15,170 --> 03:13:15,850
Back to serious.

2423
03:13:16,770 --> 03:13:19,230
Okay all serious from here on out.

2424
03:13:21,450 --> 03:13:22,350
All serious.

2425
03:13:23,430 --> 03:13:23,970
Serious.

2426
03:13:24,190 --> 03:13:24,650
Serious.

2427
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:28,170
It's the title screen.

2428
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:35,500
Who left the flowers?

2429
03:13:46,220 --> 03:13:51,380
A hero forever loyal to the flames of war.

2430
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:10,960
Snake.

2431
03:14:28,470 --> 03:14:30,390
He finally got his cigarette.

2432
03:14:39,700 --> 03:14:42,120
You've endured so much Snake.

2433
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:48,000
Sorry.

2434
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:51,900
No!

2435
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:53,300
Not the meme.

2436
03:15:02,680 --> 03:15:03,640
Serious.

2437
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:04,200
Serious.

2438
03:15:06,300 --> 03:15:07,260
Serious.

2439
03:15:07,480 --> 03:15:07,720
Serious.

2440
03:15:09,700 --> 03:15:11,700
Snake no no no no.

2441
03:15:43,780 --> 03:15:44,720
No Snake!

2442
03:15:59,890 --> 03:16:01,710
I hate this part.

2443
03:16:13,270 --> 03:16:13,950
Seriously?

2444
03:16:55,880 --> 03:16:57,220
Thank you so much.

2445
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:59,340
You guys that was sent.

2446
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:00,440
That was

2447
03:17:07,180 --> 03:17:10,620
sent 30 minutes ago.

2448
03:17:25,080 --> 03:17:26,260
We are like insane.

2449
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:26,920
No no.

2450
03:17:28,240 --> 03:17:29,620
Oh my god.

2451
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:53,520
My stomach hurts.

2452
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:03,280
I think it got delayed because of a bunch of...

2453
03:18:04,540 --> 03:18:06,440
Because of a bunch of gifted donors.

2454
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:08,200
Or gifted memberships.

2455
03:18:09,400 --> 03:18:11,160
And so it got delayed for 30 minutes.

2456
03:18:20,560 --> 03:18:22,260
Thank you so much though.

2457
03:18:23,060 --> 03:18:23,860
Holy moly.

2458
03:18:26,900 --> 03:18:30,220
I wish I was the one who kissed Snake or the one who got kissed by Ocelot.

2459
03:18:31,320 --> 03:18:31,840
Same.

2460
03:18:33,320 --> 03:18:34,720
Same to both of that.

2461
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:37,740
Oh my gosh.

2462
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:39,960
The timing was insane.

2463
03:18:42,300 --> 03:18:44,320
All according to plan.

2464
03:18:45,340 --> 03:18:45,500
No.

2465
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:52,120
Lambda are you still here?

2466
03:18:55,180 --> 03:18:56,240
Holy moly.

2467
03:18:59,020 --> 03:18:59,980
Okay.

2468
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:02,460
Let's keep going.

2469
03:19:02,460 --> 03:19:04,460
You are...

2470
03:19:07,580 --> 03:19:08,020
Serious.

2471
03:19:08,220 --> 03:19:08,900
Back to serious.

2472
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:16,480
Also thank you Andregos.

2473
03:19:17,200 --> 03:19:19,640
Thank you guys for all the donors as well.

2474
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:21,740
Sorry I couldn't say everything.

2475
03:19:21,960 --> 03:19:22,860
Say thank you all.

2476
03:19:22,960 --> 03:19:23,760
Everything was happening.

2477
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:26,460
CrunchyPBJ, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

2478
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:29,620
Senor Caruso, thank you so much for another 50 gifted.

2479
03:19:29,780 --> 03:19:30,340
Thank you guys.

2480
03:19:30,420 --> 03:19:30,860
Thank you.

2481
03:19:31,580 --> 03:19:32,300
Okay.

2482
03:19:36,780 --> 03:19:39,240
Yeah, I'm going to be playing Peace Walker in 5.

2483
03:19:42,180 --> 03:19:43,620
Alright, alright.

2484
03:19:44,240 --> 03:19:44,680
Serious.

2485
03:19:45,500 --> 03:19:46,120
Serious.

2486
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:50,760
Snake just went through it you guys.

2487
03:20:14,540 --> 03:20:15,100
Okay.

2488
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,940
Why do you act like you know him so well Otacon?

2489
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:24,180
Oh.

2490
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:26,660
That makes sense.

2491
03:20:26,660 --> 03:20:28,820
No need to hold back anymore, huh?

2492
03:20:40,420 --> 03:20:41,540
Oh,

2493
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:46,940
SOP syndrome.

2494
03:20:47,720 --> 03:20:50,640
SOP kept more than just alcohol under control.

2495
03:20:51,520 --> 03:20:53,980
Those poor slobs are virtually naked now.

2496
03:20:55,500 --> 03:20:56,940
Now they have to...

2497
03:20:58,320 --> 03:21:00,180
They have to learn how to deal with their emotions.

2498
03:21:00,200 --> 03:21:00,200
Oh no!

2499
03:21:00,220 --> 03:21:03,740
I guess getting rid of the Patriots won't solve all our problems overnight.

2500
03:21:06,820 --> 03:21:10,280
You probably already suspected this but...

2501
03:21:10,280 --> 03:21:13,500
I'm not actually an employee of AT security.

2502
03:21:13,500 --> 03:21:14,060
Huh?

2503
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:21,740
Time for Drebbin's sad backstory.

2504
03:21:25,500 --> 03:21:27,620
The dang Patriots.

2505
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:35,340
Yep.

2506
03:21:38,560 --> 03:21:39,960
Who...

2507
03:21:40,960 --> 03:21:44,420
Who isn't it's former child soldier in this game?

2508
03:22:03,140 --> 03:22:05,460
Where's the other Drebbins?

2509
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:06,500
What are they doing?

2510
03:22:09,960 --> 03:22:11,600
Because they let me.

2511
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:20,440
Sonny is the current child soldier.

2512
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:41,720
Wow.

2513
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:50,660
You mean the entity that was so good at controlling everything...

2514
03:22:52,620 --> 03:22:55,880
Was actually controlling everything?

2515
03:22:58,480 --> 03:23:02,520
No, it's an anagram for PATRIOT!

2516
03:23:09,960 --> 03:23:10,620
Hey, hey.

2517
03:23:11,180 --> 03:23:12,160
That's not your line.

2518
03:23:14,080 --> 03:23:14,840
Almost.

2519
03:23:39,960 --> 03:23:40,700
Do you have a job now?

2520
03:23:57,860 --> 03:23:58,800
Easy there.

2521
03:23:59,740 --> 03:24:01,960
But if the guns...

2522
03:24:03,540 --> 03:24:08,340
But if the guns don't have the locks on them...

2523
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:14,760
Do they still need to be laundered?

2524
03:24:17,160 --> 03:24:19,340
And isn't the war supposed to be over?

2525
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:24,400
Aren't wars supposed to be over?

2526
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:33,260
They still sell guns?

2527
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:37,100
But couldn't they buy guns from anyone?

2528
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:39,640
Whatever.

2529
03:24:40,220 --> 03:24:41,040
It's fine.

2530
03:24:42,340 --> 03:24:43,980
War never changes.

2531
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:47,100
Until it does.

2532
03:24:48,540 --> 03:24:51,480
He's like, that's my wife!

2533
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:52,740
Oh yeah!

2534
03:24:55,500 --> 03:24:57,140
Oh yeah.

2535
03:25:01,820 --> 03:25:04,160
What's this dude yapping about?

2536
03:25:09,240 --> 03:25:12,020
Get that bottle out of this man's hand.

2537
03:25:16,660 --> 03:25:18,720
It's Rebin's first time being drunk.

2538
03:25:22,140 --> 03:25:22,800
Yeah.

2539
03:25:22,800 --> 03:25:22,980
Yeah.

2540
03:25:35,880 --> 03:25:36,820
No, Sunny.

2541
03:25:40,240 --> 03:25:41,360
Give it to him!

2542
03:25:57,820 --> 03:26:00,820
He's my very first outside friend.

2543
03:26:02,900 --> 03:26:04,820
So cute.

2544
03:26:15,340 --> 03:26:19,300
You don't want to be a hikikomori anymore like me?

2545
03:26:21,880 --> 03:26:23,440
Don't guilt her, Otacon.

2546
03:26:29,840 --> 03:26:32,180
She can still go outside and live with you.

2547
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:34,820
It's not one or the other.

2548
03:26:38,730 --> 03:26:40,150
Look, she's a free bird.

2549
03:26:40,530 --> 03:26:42,650
The sun looks so pretty.

2550
03:26:50,330 --> 03:26:52,110
I like it outside.

2551
03:26:52,990 --> 03:26:53,350
Aww.

2552
03:27:00,380 --> 03:27:01,500
He's so sad.

2553
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:03,440
He's like...

2554
03:27:03,440 --> 03:27:03,820
No.

2555
03:27:06,540 --> 03:27:08,000
I hate this life.

2556
03:27:14,220 --> 03:27:14,980
No!

2557
03:27:32,570 --> 03:27:35,270
I wonder if I'll ever see him again.

2558
03:27:41,180 --> 03:27:41,670
No!

2559
03:27:42,370 --> 03:27:42,790
No!

2560
03:27:54,960 --> 03:27:58,350
Are you crying, Uncle Hal?

2561
03:28:00,010 --> 03:28:00,990
No.

2562
03:28:00,990 --> 03:28:01,090
No.

2563
03:28:04,550 --> 03:28:05,870
I'm not crying.

2564
03:28:19,030 --> 03:28:20,390
I'm crying.

2565
03:28:31,140 --> 03:28:31,840
No.

2566
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:32,060
No.

2567
03:28:36,980 --> 03:28:45,060
This is what happens when she only eats eggs instead of ramen noodles her entire life up until now.

2568
03:28:54,280 --> 03:28:55,120
No.

2569
03:29:07,760 --> 03:29:08,360
No.

2570
03:29:29,270 --> 03:29:37,330
The part when Otacon gets sad at Sunny because she wants to be outside.

2571
03:29:37,450 --> 03:29:39,230
He turns around and he's just like...

2572
03:29:39,230 --> 03:29:40,550
I'm so disappointed in her.

2573
03:29:41,290 --> 03:29:42,250
She's a normie.

2574
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:45,370
After I tried to write Voice of God.

2575
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:02,260
Big Boss?

2576
03:30:07,040 --> 03:30:08,360
Big Boss?

2577
03:30:08,740 --> 03:30:09,760
Big Boss?

2578
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:11,620
Big Boss?

2579
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:14,220
Big Boss?

2580
03:30:15,320 --> 03:30:17,080
He didn't talk in this game.

2581
03:30:21,670 --> 03:30:22,750
He didn't do it.

2582
03:30:25,910 --> 03:30:26,650
That's right.

2583
03:30:27,430 --> 03:30:28,430
Good.

2584
03:30:30,830 --> 03:30:33,450
No need for you to go just yet.

2585
03:30:38,200 --> 03:30:41,520
It's been a long time, Snake.

2586
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:47,280
No.

2587
03:30:50,380 --> 03:30:51,380
No.

2588
03:30:53,280 --> 03:30:54,640
Big Boss?

2589
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:55,760
But you...

2590
03:30:55,760 --> 03:30:57,200
You were liquid.

2591
03:30:57,340 --> 03:30:59,320
Not liquid, but you were soup.

2592
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:01,760
You were in the body bag.

2593
03:31:06,400 --> 03:31:06,920
How?

2594
03:31:23,110 --> 03:31:24,650
He's got the Patriot.

2595
03:31:41,070 --> 03:31:42,390
Why were you soup?

2596
03:31:43,450 --> 03:31:44,550
And how are you here?

2597
03:31:46,270 --> 03:31:48,250
And you still have a grudge against him.

2598
03:31:52,070 --> 03:31:53,450
Uh oh.

2599
03:31:57,520 --> 03:31:59,040
Going for the CQC.

2600
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:02,060
The CQC hug!

2601
03:32:19,270 --> 03:32:20,310
That's weird.

2602
03:32:26,590 --> 03:32:31,530
Time for you to put aside the gun and live.

2603
03:32:37,560 --> 03:32:39,720
Yeah, deconstruct that stuff.

2604
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:41,580
Yeah.

2605
03:32:44,580 --> 03:32:48,080
It all began with a bunch of old fools.

2606
03:32:52,660 --> 03:32:54,640
They've all passed away.

2607
03:32:56,440 --> 03:32:58,260
Their era of folly is over.

2608
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:03,160
I'm the only one left.

2609
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:06,680
And soon, I'll be gone too.

2610
03:33:08,680 --> 03:33:11,540
How can you still be alive?

2611
03:33:13,400 --> 03:33:18,880
That body, liquid burned on the Volta, wasn't mine.

2612
03:33:20,480 --> 03:33:24,300
That was the body of a clone.

2613
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:27,000
What other clone was there?

2614
03:33:28,000 --> 03:33:29,520
Solidus!

2615
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:33,240
My man, Solidus.

2616
03:33:33,660 --> 03:33:35,400
No way!

2617
03:33:39,460 --> 03:33:40,680
Poor Solidus.

2618
03:33:57,000 --> 03:33:58,920
Eva died for Solidus.

2619
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:31,280
So he's been asleep this whole time?

2620
03:34:52,180 --> 03:34:53,760
Thank you for the superchat.

2621
03:34:58,120 --> 03:34:59,520
Zero.

2622
03:35:04,160 --> 03:35:05,620
Oh, stop.

2623
03:35:05,620 --> 03:35:05,960
Stop.

2624
03:35:25,360 --> 03:35:27,480
That's why Solidus was soup.

2625
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:28,940
He had no skin.

2626
03:35:30,140 --> 03:35:30,420
No.

2627
03:35:45,980 --> 03:35:47,300
This...

2628
03:35:47,300 --> 03:35:48,620
This...

2629
03:35:49,400 --> 03:35:50,500
This freak is weird.

2630
03:36:01,460 --> 03:36:02,860
This guy...

2631
03:36:05,800 --> 03:36:09,500
Someone can be made to play a specific role.

2632
03:36:12,940 --> 03:36:16,980
I love cats.

2633
03:36:20,510 --> 03:36:22,960
The way he talks about us.

2634
03:36:29,320 --> 03:36:31,460
Oh my god.

2635
03:36:31,820 --> 03:36:32,800
Zero jump scare.

2636
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:34,040
Holy hell.

2637
03:36:34,040 --> 03:36:35,440
Oh god.

2638
03:36:43,830 --> 03:36:45,190
Potato man.

2639
03:36:55,020 --> 03:36:59,670
I just accidentally poured all my popcorn all over the floor.

2640
03:37:15,030 --> 03:37:15,530
Oops.

2641
03:37:16,710 --> 03:37:16,870
Oopsie.

2642
03:37:19,710 --> 03:37:20,910
Actually, most of it's in my lap.

2643
03:37:34,530 --> 03:37:36,510
Not the AI marketer.

2644
03:37:47,930 --> 03:37:48,370
What?

2645
03:37:52,670 --> 03:37:53,650
I'm so confused.

2646
03:37:53,710 --> 03:37:55,410
Holy moly, this is real Metal Gear Solid.

2647
03:37:57,090 --> 03:37:57,530
Yeah.

2648
03:38:02,070 --> 03:38:04,470
This is probably some of the craziest lore dump in the game.

2649
03:38:10,710 --> 03:38:11,650
Without change.

2650
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:30,210
That's not good.

2651
03:38:40,710 --> 03:38:42,370
The war economy.

2652
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:46,250
The AI was just like, how can we make more money?

2653
03:38:46,630 --> 03:38:46,730
War.

2654
03:39:10,710 --> 03:39:14,090
This is so messed up, because it's like Zero's will.

2655
03:39:14,770 --> 03:39:17,810
Exactly, it was supposed to be the boss's will.

2656
03:39:18,190 --> 03:39:20,110
And it got so screwed.

2657
03:39:22,350 --> 03:39:32,350
The fact that they would interpret Zero's will as wanting more war when the boss was just like no.

2658
03:39:33,910 --> 03:39:38,910
She sacrificed herself to not have war.

2659
03:39:41,290 --> 03:39:43,570
They just screwed it all up.

2660
03:39:45,490 --> 03:39:47,990
It's so wacky, it's so screwy.

2661
03:39:49,310 --> 03:39:54,390
She literally sacrificed herself so that America and Russia would not go to war.

2662
03:39:55,890 --> 03:40:04,510
Like, it's so...everything is just...the worst miscommunication case ever.

2663
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:06,090
There was only the war economy.

2664
03:40:06,570 --> 03:40:08,670
It was a colossal error in judgment.

2665
03:40:09,190 --> 03:40:11,850
One Zero couldn't possibly have foreseen.

2666
03:40:11,930 --> 03:40:15,610
If you...I mean you couldn't foresee it.

2667
03:40:16,150 --> 03:40:18,370
He just...oh my god.

2668
03:40:18,730 --> 03:40:20,110
Wow, that guy still has hair.

2669
03:40:20,770 --> 03:40:21,530
I never realized.

2670
03:40:22,710 --> 03:40:28,170
I thought he was just a bald potato.

2671
03:40:35,690 --> 03:40:41,790
He's completely unaware of the fact that he led the world to the brink of ruin.

2672
03:40:44,370 --> 03:40:48,510
If you think it's pathetic seeing Snake the way he is in this game...

2673
03:40:55,930 --> 03:40:58,110
It's really pathetic seeing Zero like this.

2674
03:41:01,450 --> 03:41:04,270
Nah, he's just a pathetic old man.

2675
03:41:11,400 --> 03:41:13,220
He's like 200 years old.

2676
03:41:16,220 --> 03:41:19,140
He could become that guy from Warhammer.

2677
03:41:26,670 --> 03:41:28,610
Did you miss the piss jokes?

2678
03:41:29,370 --> 03:41:30,390
One more!

2679
03:41:30,470 --> 03:41:30,950
One more!

2680
03:41:31,050 --> 03:41:31,270
Woo!

2681
03:41:35,710 --> 03:41:37,030
The Emperor.

2682
03:41:37,230 --> 03:41:38,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2683
03:41:46,670 --> 03:41:48,330
All of them.

2684
03:41:49,710 --> 03:41:51,390
Everybody is gone.

2685
03:42:04,110 --> 03:42:05,030
In chaos.

2686
03:42:07,250 --> 03:42:10,930
The world is born from Zero.

2687
03:42:12,750 --> 03:42:18,530
The moment Zero becomes One is the moment the world springs to life.

2688
03:42:20,330 --> 03:42:21,550
One becomes Two.

2689
03:42:22,290 --> 03:42:23,610
Two becomes Ten.

2690
03:42:24,850 --> 03:42:26,490
Ten becomes 100.

2691
03:42:28,030 --> 03:42:29,010
What's this math?

2692
03:42:29,290 --> 03:42:30,530
What math is he mathing?

2693
03:42:30,530 --> 03:42:35,050
Taking it all back to One solves nothing.

2694
03:42:37,230 --> 03:42:45,090
So long as Zero remains, One will eventually grow to 100 again.

2695
03:42:55,300 --> 03:43:01,980
And so, our goal was to erase Zero.

2696
03:43:07,310 --> 03:43:12,770
Even the mighty Patriots began with a single man.

2697
03:43:14,270 --> 03:43:18,870
That one man's desires grew huge, bloated.

2698
03:43:20,550 --> 03:43:24,590
Absorbed technology began to manipulate the economy.

2699
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:30,490
We realized too late that we had created a beast.

2700
03:43:32,390 --> 03:43:34,790
We had helped turn Zero.

2701
03:43:40,080 --> 03:43:43,140
His sin was ours.

2702
03:43:44,700 --> 03:43:54,420
But for that reason, I'm taking it upon myself to send Zero back to nothing.

2703
03:43:59,880 --> 03:44:00,660
Unplug him.

2704
03:44:01,420 --> 03:44:02,020
Do it.

2705
03:44:27,480 --> 03:44:28,640
That was so fast.

2706
03:44:33,080 --> 03:44:33,760
Goodbye,

2707
03:44:44,490 --> 03:44:45,090
Major Zero.

2708
03:44:50,270 --> 03:44:52,090
You going back to Zero as well?

2709
03:44:54,730 --> 03:44:56,970
You erased me two times before.

2710
03:45:00,230 --> 03:45:02,350
Today will mark the third.

2711
03:45:06,790 --> 03:45:07,770
The Fox die.

2712
03:45:08,710 --> 03:45:09,970
Zero planted in you.

2713
03:45:11,290 --> 03:45:16,010
It's already begun, eating away at my body.

2714
03:45:19,390 --> 03:45:27,410
Truth is, the Fox dying in you is what killed Eva.

2715
03:45:28,450 --> 03:45:31,450
Ocelot, what are you talking about?

2716
03:45:32,010 --> 03:45:32,730
Hail me.

2717
03:45:33,610 --> 03:45:37,490
She told me everything.

2718
03:45:42,930 --> 03:45:44,210
What's wrong?

2719
03:45:47,590 --> 03:45:48,410
They did it again.

2720
03:45:50,730 --> 03:45:54,490
They used you to kill me.

2721
03:45:57,330 --> 03:46:02,870
The Patriots know their proxies.

2722
03:46:02,930 --> 03:46:05,170
In order to bury us.

2723
03:46:06,790 --> 03:46:08,270
They did it again.

2724
03:46:08,270 --> 03:46:13,790
In the end, they're no more than a program.

2725
03:46:15,470 --> 03:46:21,650
All they can do is repeat the same pattern over and over again.

2726
03:46:27,150 --> 03:46:30,470
Do me a favor, will you?

2727
03:46:31,990 --> 03:46:34,130
Take me over to her.

2728
03:46:40,220 --> 03:46:42,880
When did she have the chance to talk to me?

2729
03:46:43,180 --> 03:46:44,680
I hate this.

2730
03:46:51,100 --> 03:46:54,640
There's one more thing Naomi wanted me to tell you.

2731
03:46:58,520 --> 03:47:01,020
Old Fox die in your body.

2732
03:47:02,080 --> 03:47:04,660
The one that mutated.

2733
03:47:06,820 --> 03:47:12,700
The new Fox die inside you continues to multiply.

2734
03:47:14,080 --> 03:47:22,540
At the same time, it is preventing the old mutated Fox die from reproducing.

2735
03:47:22,600 --> 03:47:30,040
The new Fox die is uprooting the old.

2736
03:47:32,220 --> 03:47:36,200
Naomi confirmed it in her follow up.

2737
03:47:36,780 --> 03:47:40,060
The mutants are receding.

2738
03:47:40,060 --> 03:47:40,680
Oh, see?

2739
03:47:40,980 --> 03:47:42,420
She couldn't tell you that directly.

2740
03:47:45,360 --> 03:47:47,380
Because, you know, you almost shot yourself.

2741
03:47:53,240 --> 03:47:59,180
The worst character to ever exist.

2742
03:47:59,180 --> 03:48:06,500
Even then, the process will just repeat itself.

2743
03:48:10,220 --> 03:48:15,240
One day, the new Fox die too will start to mutate.

2744
03:48:17,300 --> 03:48:21,060
And become a new threat.

2745
03:48:25,880 --> 03:48:30,240
But that is, if you manage to live that long.

2746
03:48:30,640 --> 03:48:32,040
It will probably be good for you.

2747
03:48:32,560 --> 03:48:35,020
It will probably be good for you.

2748
03:49:23,720 --> 03:49:28,880
I've never thought of you as a son.

2749
03:49:31,600 --> 03:49:37,620
But I've always respected you as a soldier.

2750
03:49:41,170 --> 03:49:42,790
As a man.

2751
03:49:47,170 --> 03:49:50,910
If you'd been in my place back then.

2752
03:49:52,750 --> 03:49:58,070
Maybe you wouldn't have made the same mistakes that I did.

2753
03:50:00,930 --> 03:50:05,450
Ever since the day I killed the Boss.

2754
03:50:10,250 --> 03:50:15,590
I was already dead.

2755
03:50:31,650 --> 03:50:33,170
No, that is why he's Big Boss.

2756
03:50:33,350 --> 03:50:36,270
It's not about changing the world.

2757
03:50:37,490 --> 03:50:46,590
It's about doing our best to live the way it is.

2758
03:50:48,450 --> 03:50:53,490
It's about respecting the will of others.

2759
03:50:54,670 --> 03:50:56,510
Believing in your own.

2760
03:51:00,640 --> 03:51:05,220
Isn't that what you thought?

2761
03:51:19,830 --> 03:51:28,790
At last, I understand the meaning behind what you did.

2762
03:51:28,790 --> 03:51:39,560
At last, I understand the truth behind your courage.

2763
03:51:47,220 --> 03:51:49,040
You can do it!

2764
03:52:14,100 --> 03:52:17,060
It's almost time for me to go.

2765
03:52:18,320 --> 03:52:23,760
And with me, the last ember of this fruitless war dies out.

2766
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:30,180
And at last, those old evils will be gone.

2767
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:44,120
Once the source of evil returns to zero, a new one, a new future will be born.

2768
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:55,060
That new world is yours to live in.

2769
03:52:55,060 --> 03:52:56,900
Not you guys all say F.

2770
03:53:12,260 --> 03:53:13,960
Not the grunting.

2771
03:53:15,960 --> 03:53:17,840
Gosh, like father like son.

2772
03:53:18,140 --> 03:53:18,720
So real.

2773
03:53:36,240 --> 03:53:41,800
We all fought a long bloody war for our liberty.

2774
03:53:43,760 --> 03:53:52,000
We fought to free ourselves from nations and systems and norms and ages.

2775
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:59,400
But no matter how hard we tried, the only liberty we found was on the inside.

2776
03:54:00,460 --> 03:54:03,200
Trapped within those limits.

2777
03:54:09,600 --> 03:54:19,400
The boss and I may have chosen different paths, but in the end, we were both trapped inside the same cage.

2778
03:54:20,740 --> 03:54:21,540
Liberty.

2779
03:54:25,360 --> 03:54:27,140
Why is he trying to stand up again?

2780
03:54:34,260 --> 03:54:38,460
But you... you have been given freedom.

2781
03:54:40,800 --> 03:54:43,980
Freedom to be... outside.

2782
03:54:46,080 --> 03:54:50,220
It's like son... he's finally outside of the system.

2783
03:54:52,180 --> 03:54:55,480
You are nobody's tool now.

2784
03:54:57,000 --> 03:54:58,220
No one's toy.

2785
03:55:01,060 --> 03:55:05,360
You are no longer a prisoner of fate.

2786
03:55:06,250 --> 03:55:07,240
Kind of is.

2787
03:55:07,520 --> 03:55:09,760
I mean, he's a prisoner.

2788
03:55:10,020 --> 03:55:14,440
You are no longer a seed of war.

2789
03:55:17,130 --> 03:55:24,140
It's time for you to see the outside world with your own eyes.

2790
03:55:27,150 --> 03:55:33,960
Your body and your soul are your own.

2791
03:55:38,240 --> 03:55:39,980
Forget about us.

2792
03:55:44,760 --> 03:55:47,060
Live for yourself.

2793
03:55:59,830 --> 03:56:01,230
Snake, help him!

2794
03:56:01,650 --> 03:56:03,410
Snake, help him!

2795
03:56:05,030 --> 03:56:07,490
A new lease on life.

2796
03:56:15,740 --> 03:56:17,240
He's like, you want me to get that?

2797
03:56:19,200 --> 03:56:24,660
Boss, you only need one snake.

2798
03:56:25,960 --> 03:56:27,360
No.

2799
03:56:29,360 --> 03:56:35,330
The world needs snakes.

2800
03:57:21,340 --> 03:57:25,260
This is good, isn't it?

2801
03:59:03,230 --> 03:59:05,690
It's too good.

2802
03:59:10,370 --> 03:59:15,350
It's too good.

2803
03:59:20,010 --> 03:59:21,610
It's so good.

2804
03:59:34,620 --> 03:59:37,360
It's so good.

2805
04:00:07,140 --> 04:00:09,680
Yeah, the ending is so bittersweet.

2806
04:00:13,860 --> 04:00:16,100
This whole game is so bittersweet.

2807
04:00:42,210 --> 04:00:47,150
I wish to rest forever.

2808
04:00:51,210 --> 04:00:58,340
I have to ask if there was a...

2809
04:00:59,560 --> 04:01:03,720
I would rather how many people were in here watching the ending for the first time.

2810
04:01:09,340 --> 04:01:10,800
The graveyard character.

2811
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:12,800
Yeah, I know a lot of people.

2812
04:01:13,720 --> 04:01:17,500
It's just not as cool to watch him clean up the bodies.

2813
04:01:18,440 --> 04:01:19,860
Me and my first time.

2814
04:01:19,880 --> 04:01:20,660
First time ever.

2815
04:01:38,460 --> 04:01:40,040
It's been 10 years since he played.

2816
04:01:40,840 --> 04:01:41,620
So it's been a while.

2817
04:01:42,240 --> 04:01:42,780
First timer.

2818
04:02:01,360 --> 04:02:03,920
I've watched the scenes a couple times.

2819
04:02:04,900 --> 04:02:09,740
It's a bit of an understatement, but it's still so good.

2820
04:02:12,420 --> 04:02:13,420
Man.

2821
04:02:14,880 --> 04:02:16,500
I hope you guys liked it though.

2822
04:02:19,900 --> 04:02:22,760
I have popcorn all over me.

2823
04:02:34,700 --> 04:02:37,940
A police knots and snatcher.

2824
04:02:45,370 --> 04:02:49,070
MGS series, the proof that men will never understand women.

2825
04:02:51,130 --> 04:02:52,850
Eva was right there.

2826
04:02:53,130 --> 04:02:54,550
She could have stopped them.

2827
04:02:55,670 --> 04:02:59,770
Eva knew what the boss wanted and she didn't do anything.

2828
04:03:15,060 --> 04:03:17,680
Yay, to all the staff.

2829
04:03:17,680 --> 04:03:26,190
If anything, it's a really beautiful game too.

2830
04:03:26,930 --> 04:03:30,070
Especially for the PS3 era.

2831
04:03:30,390 --> 04:03:31,190
It looks so good.

2832
04:03:31,850 --> 04:03:33,630
It holds up so well, even to now.

2833
04:03:34,470 --> 04:03:35,530
Here's to Naomi.

2834
04:03:45,280 --> 04:03:47,660
The graphics are insanely good.

2835
04:03:49,300 --> 04:03:52,000
Beauty and the Beast photo shooting session.

2836
04:03:54,040 --> 04:03:55,440
The actual models.

2837
04:04:05,950 --> 04:04:11,510
I know some people have probably said this in the chat, but in case some people didn't read...

2838
04:04:12,410 --> 04:04:19,430
In the Japanese version of this last scene...

2839
04:04:21,130 --> 04:04:28,210
The big boss is voiced by Akiya Otsuka's actual father.

2840
04:04:28,970 --> 04:04:31,050
And they were actually estranged.

2841
04:04:33,050 --> 04:04:36,510
This project kind of helped bring them back together.

2842
04:04:40,410 --> 04:04:46,170
Even in Japanese, I think it hits that even harder.

2843
04:04:47,690 --> 04:04:48,870
Amazing, right?

2844
04:04:50,830 --> 04:04:52,290
It's so good.

2845
04:04:54,470 --> 04:04:55,390
Spooky graphics!

2846
04:05:03,150 --> 04:05:04,850
It's a little too peak.

2847
04:05:06,310 --> 04:05:07,650
It's so awesome, right?

2848
04:05:13,260 --> 04:05:14,860
This song.

2849
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:27,320
My playthrough was with friends who were ruining the moment, so I never got to experience any of the motion of the story.

2850
04:05:27,960 --> 04:05:28,460
Oh no!

2851
04:05:30,400 --> 04:05:32,630
Of course we can make jokes, but...

2852
04:05:33,440 --> 04:05:35,500
At the same time, I feel...

2853
04:05:36,540 --> 04:05:38,500
Some of those scenes are just too...

2854
04:05:39,440 --> 04:05:40,900
I can't even joke at them.

2855
04:05:41,420 --> 04:05:42,360
I can't even joke.

2856
04:05:50,820 --> 04:05:51,420
What?

2857
04:05:51,420 --> 04:05:52,100
Is that a hook, papa?

2858
04:06:03,480 --> 04:06:05,020
It really is?

2859
04:06:05,080 --> 04:06:05,820
Oh my gosh.

2860
04:06:15,250 --> 04:06:16,570
What a good ending.

2861
04:06:16,870 --> 04:06:18,490
You know, like I've said before...

2862
04:06:19,010 --> 04:06:22,250
The game has its flaws.

2863
04:06:22,250 --> 04:06:33,670
And I saw someone super chat earlier how the game was probably supposed to be a redemption for Naomi, but they just kind of really flubbed it up.

2864
04:06:35,530 --> 04:06:37,950
I don't even think she really needed redemption.

2865
04:06:38,610 --> 04:06:43,610
Like, she wasn't bad in the first game.

2866
04:06:44,610 --> 04:06:45,250
It was...

2867
04:06:49,070 --> 04:07:01,300
But, you know, despite all the silliness in some parts of the game, I still think that it's like...

2868
04:07:01,790 --> 04:07:09,370
It's still just such a good ending for Snake.

2869
04:07:09,370 --> 04:07:12,850
And so I think that's why, in my opinion, it's...

2870
04:07:13,430 --> 04:07:16,370
It's a really good end to the series, too.

2871
04:07:19,870 --> 04:07:22,790
I wouldn't mind this game getting the same treatment as MGS3 with a remake.

2872
04:07:24,110 --> 04:07:26,950
I think they would take out way too many things.

2873
04:07:28,410 --> 04:07:29,830
I think, like...

2874
04:07:31,070 --> 04:07:33,370
A lot of the IP stuff...

2875
04:07:35,590 --> 04:07:38,450
Like iPod and the songs, maybe.

2876
04:07:38,590 --> 04:07:39,370
Things like that.

2877
04:07:39,470 --> 04:07:45,790
I don't know if... I think that too much stuff would be removed for it to work.

2878
04:07:52,110 --> 04:07:55,470
I think, you know, if it can get ported, that's great.

2879
04:07:58,430 --> 04:07:59,470
Honestly, like...

2880
04:07:59,470 --> 04:08:01,330
Delta doesn't really need to happen.

2881
04:08:01,330 --> 04:08:03,070
It's cool that it is.

2882
04:08:03,290 --> 04:08:05,330
Don't get me wrong, but...

2883
04:08:06,250 --> 04:08:09,930
But, like, Metal Gear Solid 3 didn't need a remake either.

2884
04:08:15,200 --> 04:08:18,260
I would... I... You know, it's probably...

2885
04:08:18,260 --> 04:08:18,560
Oh, wait.

2886
04:08:18,640 --> 04:08:18,980
Hold on.

2887
04:08:53,640 --> 04:08:55,040
Meow.

2888
04:09:03,560 --> 04:09:04,960
Meow.

2889
04:09:06,940 --> 04:09:10,020
There's nothing inside you can pass on to the next generation.

2890
04:09:11,080 --> 04:09:12,160
No genes.

2891
04:09:12,940 --> 04:09:13,700
No memes.

2892
04:09:14,700 --> 04:09:15,800
You're man-made.

2893
04:09:16,660 --> 04:09:17,460
You're a beast.

2894
04:09:21,200 --> 04:09:24,360
I thought turning off the notice would turn off the things.

2895
04:09:24,520 --> 04:09:24,620
I'm sorry.

2896
04:09:38,380 --> 04:09:39,120
Exactly.

2897
04:09:40,360 --> 04:09:42,220
That's why you need me.

2898
04:09:42,920 --> 04:09:44,080
As a witness.

2899
04:09:45,300 --> 04:09:46,380
A witness?

2900
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:48,020
Yeah.

2901
04:09:48,800 --> 04:09:52,580
Someone on the outside to bear witness to your final days.

2902
04:09:52,840 --> 04:09:53,640
Tell your story.

2903
04:09:53,660 --> 04:09:55,480
Someone to pass on your story.

2904
04:09:57,260 --> 04:09:58,820
Not that I'm the only witness.

2905
04:10:01,420 --> 04:10:03,780
But I'll remember everything you were.

2906
04:10:04,580 --> 04:10:06,780
And stick with you to the end.

2907
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:08,960
Otacon.

2908
04:10:11,040 --> 04:10:14,880
Besides, you wouldn't let me suffer Sunny's eggs alone, would you?

2909
04:10:14,960 --> 04:10:16,680
Oh my god, she knows how to cook them now!

2910
04:10:29,960 --> 04:10:31,540
Sunny catching strays.

2911
04:10:31,620 --> 04:10:32,360
For what reason?

2912
04:10:34,100 --> 04:10:36,640
That's when Otacon wrote his Twin Snakes fanfic.

2913
04:10:39,380 --> 04:10:40,160
Eggs.

2914
04:10:45,550 --> 04:10:49,910
She just put that on the grill.

2915
04:10:51,330 --> 04:10:52,910
And she said it's ready.

2916
04:11:39,860 --> 04:11:43,820
This song actually has Japanese lyrics to it.

2917
04:11:45,890 --> 04:11:47,440
Thanks for sharing the series with us.

2918
04:11:47,480 --> 04:11:48,460
Thank you!

2919
04:11:50,140 --> 04:11:52,180
Random Collusion, thank you so much for the Aqua Super.

2920
04:11:52,880 --> 04:11:53,600
Thank you.

2921
04:11:55,360 --> 04:11:56,480
Wait, I'm trying to read it.

2922
04:11:56,600 --> 04:11:59,960
Oh gosh, it's all getting... Oh gosh, YouTube is so broken.

2923
04:12:01,660 --> 04:12:02,840
I'm trying to click it.

2924
04:12:03,080 --> 04:12:03,540
There we go.

2925
04:12:04,100 --> 04:12:05,100
Long time watching, man.

2926
04:12:05,180 --> 04:12:06,560
Thanks for going through this journey again.

2927
04:12:07,040 --> 04:12:07,760
Thank you!

2928
04:12:09,080 --> 04:12:10,220
Thank you so much.

2929
04:12:18,560 --> 04:12:19,740
Twin Snakes next?

2930
04:12:19,860 --> 04:12:21,320
I'm already playing the Twin Snakes.

2931
04:12:22,400 --> 04:12:23,340
I already did it.

2932
04:12:24,760 --> 04:12:26,520
No, I've already played Twin Snakes.

2933
04:12:30,100 --> 04:12:35,020
Also, for the person who donoed earlier.

2934
04:12:35,240 --> 04:12:37,580
Yeah, I will play Rising again.

2935
04:12:37,820 --> 04:12:38,260
Don't worry.

2936
04:12:39,400 --> 04:12:40,700
But next is Peace Walker.

2937
04:12:41,400 --> 04:12:43,100
Then we got Five.

2938
04:12:45,700 --> 04:12:46,260
Rising.

2939
04:12:46,260 --> 04:12:48,860
I don't know when I'll do Rising.

2940
04:12:49,060 --> 04:12:50,820
Maybe after the Solid series.

2941
04:12:53,600 --> 04:12:54,840
I still have Snake's Revenge.

2942
04:12:55,480 --> 04:12:56,600
I still have Acid.

2943
04:12:57,780 --> 04:12:58,900
Still have Survive.

2944
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:02,460
I guess Portable Ops.

2945
04:13:03,300 --> 04:13:04,660
We gotta do all of them.

2946
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:06,920
I have to have every single game on my channel.

2947
04:13:08,280 --> 04:13:09,720
Yeah, Metal Gear 1 and 2.

2948
04:13:15,320 --> 04:13:15,960
Pachinko.

2949
04:13:15,980 --> 04:13:15,980
Pachinko?

2950
04:13:16,080 --> 04:13:16,880
I already played that.

2951
04:13:18,820 --> 04:13:20,720
I already played that too.

2952
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:22,220
I have that.

2953
04:13:25,320 --> 04:13:27,240
We're still so far.

2954
04:13:27,440 --> 04:13:30,400
We have so many driven points I need.

2955
04:13:30,400 --> 04:13:31,340
I need...

2956
04:13:36,560 --> 04:13:39,040
I didn't know you turned it off.

2957
04:13:39,100 --> 04:13:39,740
Oh, sorry!

2958
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:41,960
I turned it off because I didn't want the sounds going.

2959
04:13:42,740 --> 04:13:45,100
But thank you Haizmi for the Aka dono.

2960
04:13:45,180 --> 04:13:45,920
Thank you so much.

2961
04:13:46,060 --> 04:13:46,620
Thank you, thank you.

2962
04:13:47,300 --> 04:13:48,880
Always a treat to watch you play MGS.

2963
04:13:48,980 --> 04:13:49,680
Here's to you, Minto.

2964
04:13:49,900 --> 04:13:51,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2965
04:13:51,800 --> 04:13:52,520
Yeah.

2966
04:13:56,120 --> 04:13:59,580
I always, every time I play this game.

2967
04:14:01,060 --> 04:14:06,880
Or like, rather, when I think about how I play the games.

2968
04:14:07,040 --> 04:14:09,820
Like, rather, when I'm like, okay, I'll play 1 through 4.

2969
04:14:10,040 --> 04:14:11,480
And then I'll play in release order.

2970
04:14:11,620 --> 04:14:13,780
I always think like, man, I should have played this one last.

2971
04:14:15,300 --> 04:14:16,480
Even after everything.

2972
04:14:16,480 --> 04:14:22,080
It's like, this one should have been last.

2973
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:24,140
You know?

2974
04:14:25,460 --> 04:14:27,780
Because it's just so...

2975
04:14:27,780 --> 04:14:31,260
It's just, you know, it does wrap up so well.

2976
04:14:31,900 --> 04:14:32,760
It is so final.

2977
04:14:35,260 --> 04:14:37,700
Yeah, it feels like the final game for sure.

2978
04:14:37,980 --> 04:14:38,920
It's so good.

2979
04:14:39,400 --> 04:14:40,660
It's so good.

2980
04:14:42,020 --> 04:14:42,440
Man.

2981
04:14:46,740 --> 04:14:47,300
So...

2982
04:14:49,220 --> 04:14:51,280
Have you gotten the board game?

2983
04:14:51,360 --> 04:14:52,000
I have!

2984
04:14:52,060 --> 04:14:52,840
I haven't played it.

2985
04:14:52,920 --> 04:14:54,380
I haven't even actually unboxed it.

2986
04:14:54,500 --> 04:14:55,280
It's still in the box.

2987
04:14:57,440 --> 04:14:58,340
But yeah.

2988
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:06,260
You don't have to get emotionally invested in 5.

2989
04:15:06,980 --> 04:15:08,320
Would I eat a pigeon?

2990
04:15:09,220 --> 04:15:09,420
What?

2991
04:15:18,600 --> 04:15:18,920
No!

2992
04:15:26,260 --> 04:15:26,820
Scorpion.

2993
04:15:27,800 --> 04:15:28,360
Inchworm.

2994
04:15:29,120 --> 04:15:29,580
Hyena.

2995
04:15:29,580 --> 04:15:30,920
Hawk.

2996
04:15:32,360 --> 04:15:33,160
Eagle.

2997
04:15:37,880 --> 04:15:42,580
The title were to experience weapon handlers who racked up their heads so I can't...

2998
04:15:43,480 --> 04:15:44,620
I'm a gamer!

2999
04:15:45,980 --> 04:15:47,420
I'm a gamer!

3000
04:15:48,560 --> 04:15:49,820
I'm a gamer!

3001
04:15:50,520 --> 04:15:51,380
No way!

3002
04:15:52,120 --> 04:15:52,520
Really?

3003
04:15:53,680 --> 04:15:55,040
That's why I got Eagle!

3004
04:15:56,300 --> 04:15:57,580
I'm a gamer.

3005
04:16:00,810 --> 04:16:02,190
Oh my gosh.

3006
04:16:03,750 --> 04:16:06,880
Oh my gosh.

3007
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:07,620
I'm a gamer.

3008
04:16:07,780 --> 04:16:08,380
I'm a gamer.

3009
04:16:14,320 --> 04:16:16,480
We have to go try it.

3010
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:17,740
The solar gun!

3011
04:16:18,860 --> 04:16:20,500
The weapon of a holy knight.

3012
04:16:20,840 --> 04:16:23,020
Uses the power of the sun to banish darkness.

3013
04:16:23,540 --> 04:16:27,300
While holding the L1 button, hold the R1 button to charge it, then release it to fire.

3014
04:16:27,700 --> 04:16:28,720
There are two levels of charge.

3015
04:16:28,840 --> 04:16:30,540
The longer the weapon is charged, the more powerful the shot.

3016
04:16:30,820 --> 04:16:32,500
Press the triangle while aiming to use the side.

3017
04:16:32,580 --> 04:16:34,640
Press the O to recharge it with solar energy.

3018
04:16:34,640 --> 04:16:34,740
Wait.

3019
04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:41,140
Items you obtain will become available after you meet up with... Oh gosh.

3020
04:16:42,220 --> 04:16:42,940
The Mark II.

3021
04:16:46,100 --> 04:16:47,640
We got it though!

3022
04:16:48,460 --> 04:16:50,160
Oh yeah, we can use it in the VR shooting range.

3023
04:16:50,280 --> 04:16:51,140
True, true, true.

3024
04:16:54,520 --> 04:16:55,180
New save.

3025
04:17:06,360 --> 04:17:06,680
Oh my gosh.

3026
04:17:06,680 --> 04:17:08,460
Yeah, we'd have to do all of Act 1 exactly.

3027
04:17:08,760 --> 04:17:09,440
Oh my gosh.

3028
04:17:12,320 --> 04:17:13,720
We can do it in the VR area.

3029
04:17:13,720 --> 04:17:13,800
Yeah.

3030
04:17:22,470 --> 04:17:23,030
Now,

3031
04:17:26,150 --> 04:17:28,090
you can have a new appreciated...

3032
04:17:29,130 --> 04:17:31,510
Appreciation rather for the...

3033
04:17:31,510 --> 04:17:33,090
For this...

3034
04:17:33,770 --> 04:17:34,550
Title screen.

3035
04:17:36,030 --> 04:17:38,090
Since it's literally the end of the game.

3036
04:17:41,470 --> 04:17:43,950
You can even see him get the gun out.

3037
04:17:44,350 --> 04:17:46,170
And then like, you know...

3038
04:17:48,510 --> 04:17:49,270
Snake...

3039
04:17:49,950 --> 04:17:52,090
Actually in the novel...

3040
04:17:52,090 --> 04:17:55,170
For those curious what happens afterwards, but...

3041
04:17:56,130 --> 04:18:00,170
The novelization of the 4 says that...

3042
04:18:01,030 --> 04:18:03,970
Snake spends his days with...

3043
04:18:03,970 --> 04:18:07,070
Spends the rest of his days with Otacon and Sunny.

3044
04:18:07,670 --> 04:18:09,570
And he passes away peacefully.

3045
04:18:10,130 --> 04:18:11,750
With a smile on his face.

3046
04:18:12,370 --> 04:18:13,090
Next to them.

3047
04:18:16,170 --> 04:18:17,290
It's novel only in Japanese.

3048
04:18:17,370 --> 04:18:19,230
No, actually, it has been translated.

3049
04:18:19,850 --> 04:18:21,270
There's an official translation even.

3050
04:18:27,400 --> 04:18:28,040
So...

3051
04:18:32,970 --> 04:18:34,150
Virtual range.

3052
04:18:37,110 --> 04:18:39,810
And all this happened because Volgin shot a nuke.

3053
04:18:40,250 --> 04:18:42,130
It's kind of insane, the...

3054
04:18:43,210 --> 04:18:45,590
The series of events that...

3055
04:18:45,590 --> 04:18:48,290
Took place to get to, like...

3056
04:18:48,290 --> 04:18:52,290
How insane everything is in this, like...

3057
04:18:52,290 --> 04:18:55,450
Seeing what's going on in 3...

3058
04:18:55,450 --> 04:18:57,350
And then getting to 4...

3059
04:18:57,350 --> 04:18:58,430
Is like...

3060
04:18:58,430 --> 04:19:01,050
The leap is so insane.

3061
04:19:01,410 --> 04:19:01,870
Actually.

3062
04:19:04,030 --> 04:19:05,070
Let's see.

3063
04:19:05,190 --> 04:19:06,030
Solar Guard!

3064
04:19:08,370 --> 04:19:10,150
There it is!

3065
04:19:10,150 --> 04:19:10,230
There it is!

3066
04:19:20,130 --> 04:19:20,770
What

3067
04:19:25,880 --> 04:19:27,080
is he saying?

3068
04:19:29,180 --> 04:19:30,060
Wait, hold on.

3069
04:19:31,040 --> 04:19:31,920
What was it again?

3070
04:19:33,560 --> 04:19:34,740
Oh, press...

3071
04:19:34,740 --> 04:19:35,900
Wait, no, no, no.

3072
04:19:35,980 --> 04:19:36,300
Circle!

3073
04:19:38,660 --> 04:19:39,300
Satellite!

3074
04:19:42,860 --> 04:19:43,340
Satellite!

3075
04:19:55,480 --> 04:19:57,800
Hold on, I'm getting the energy lower.

3076
04:20:09,660 --> 04:20:10,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3077
04:20:25,520 --> 04:20:27,580
This is all I ever wanted!

3078
04:20:41,360 --> 04:20:43,740
It's all I ever wanted!

3079
04:20:45,340 --> 04:20:46,000
Oh my gosh.

3080
04:20:46,600 --> 04:20:47,020
Sorry.

3081
04:20:50,440 --> 04:20:51,180
Strike!

3082
04:20:53,660 --> 04:20:54,500
Satellite!

3083
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:56,340
Go!

3084
04:21:04,340 --> 04:21:08,220
Time to eradicate them.

3085
04:21:08,980 --> 04:21:09,820
Strike!

3086
04:21:17,360 --> 04:21:18,760
Satellite!

3087
04:21:24,660 --> 04:21:26,320
Let's put on something happy.

3088
04:21:26,320 --> 04:21:26,780
Wait.

3089
04:21:27,680 --> 04:21:28,100
Menu.

3090
04:21:28,500 --> 04:21:29,680
Wait, how do I go back?

3091
04:21:29,760 --> 04:21:31,660
Oh gosh, I don't know how to use the iPod.

3092
04:21:32,140 --> 04:21:32,560
Menu?

3093
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:33,340
Wait, no.

3094
04:21:33,620 --> 04:21:34,460
Menu, menu.

3095
04:21:35,200 --> 04:21:35,620
Songs.

3096
04:21:58,170 --> 04:21:58,590
Satellite!

3097
04:22:05,720 --> 04:22:06,140
Satellite!

3098
04:22:13,220 --> 04:22:14,620
Satellite!

3099
04:22:21,310 --> 04:22:23,950
It was worth it!

3100
04:22:32,730 --> 04:22:34,730
This song is so cute.

3101
04:22:38,170 --> 04:22:39,010
Satellite!

3102
04:22:40,550 --> 04:22:41,250
Satellite!

3103
04:22:41,250 --> 04:22:41,730
Strike!

3104
04:22:55,800 --> 04:22:58,600
And this

3105
04:23:21,560 --> 04:23:22,860
thing does mega damage.

3106
04:23:22,880 --> 04:23:23,620
It's crazy.

3107
04:23:36,970 --> 04:23:38,310
Satellite!

3108
04:23:39,770 --> 04:23:41,170
Satellite!

3109
04:23:44,870 --> 04:23:46,270
Satellite!

3110
04:23:49,450 --> 04:23:50,850
Satellite!

3111
04:23:54,850 --> 04:23:55,290
Satellite!

3112
04:23:59,010 --> 04:23:59,450
Satellite!

3113
04:24:00,170 --> 04:24:00,330
Satellite!

3114
04:24:13,520 --> 04:24:15,840
And one more with my favorite song.

3115
04:24:17,080 --> 04:24:18,560
One more with my favorite song.

3116
04:24:18,640 --> 04:24:19,240
Oh wait, we're off.

3117
04:24:28,140 --> 04:24:30,380
This song is like an Astro Bomb BGM.

3118
04:24:30,920 --> 04:24:31,620
That's so mean.

3119
04:24:31,700 --> 04:24:32,880
Thank you for the meme.

3120
04:24:48,860 --> 04:24:51,240
I wish any of these guys would dance.

3121
04:25:05,760 --> 04:25:06,300
Snake!

3122
04:25:08,680 --> 04:25:11,080
It's now my turn to protect you, Snake.

3123
04:25:15,960 --> 04:25:17,420
Surely I'd be bigger.

3124
04:25:17,800 --> 04:25:18,900
I'd be like...

3125
04:25:18,900 --> 04:25:20,680
It's my turn to protect you, Snake.

3126
04:25:25,740 --> 04:25:26,420
I'd

3127
04:25:30,380 --> 04:25:32,420
be like this big next year.

3128
04:25:33,300 --> 04:25:34,920
It's my turn to protect you, Snake.

3129
04:25:39,280 --> 04:25:41,340
I wonder how tall he is, actually.

3130
04:25:43,860 --> 04:25:46,520
Thank you guys for MGS4.

3131
04:25:50,960 --> 04:25:52,740
Charge at the screen.

3132
04:25:55,040 --> 04:25:55,720
Satellite!

3133
04:25:56,360 --> 04:25:58,000
If I shoot...

3134
04:25:58,000 --> 04:25:58,420
No!

3135
04:25:59,560 --> 04:26:00,500
Turn around, Snake.

3136
04:26:01,680 --> 04:26:02,380
Wait, hold on.

3137
04:26:02,680 --> 04:26:05,140
I don't want any of these guys in our background.

3138
04:26:06,340 --> 04:26:06,800
Wait, hold on.

3139
04:26:11,430 --> 04:26:12,310
Wait, no, no, no.

3140
04:26:12,390 --> 04:26:12,830
Sorry, my bad.

3141
04:26:13,350 --> 04:26:15,090
I'm getting the thing down.

3142
04:26:16,430 --> 04:26:17,050
The battery.

3143
04:26:17,930 --> 04:26:18,470
There we go.

3144
04:26:20,910 --> 04:26:22,050
There we go.

3145
04:26:22,710 --> 04:26:22,950
Alright.

3146
04:26:23,290 --> 04:26:23,870
Ready, Snake?

3147
04:26:24,010 --> 04:26:24,790
Together, together!

3148
04:26:25,470 --> 04:26:26,510
Together, together, together!

3149
04:26:26,810 --> 04:26:27,050
Ready?

3150
04:26:28,510 --> 04:26:28,990
Satellite!

3151
04:26:43,550 --> 04:26:44,150
Satellite!

3152
04:26:47,800 --> 04:26:48,400
Satellite!

3153
04:26:56,940 --> 04:26:57,540
Why

3154
04:27:00,830 --> 04:27:02,510
Metal Gear Solid 4?

3155
04:27:03,770 --> 04:27:05,970
We'll get Two-Piece Walker eventually.

3156
04:27:12,620 --> 04:27:14,960
Oh yeah, there was someone to say happy birthday to.

3157
04:27:16,540 --> 04:27:17,680
Who was it?

3158
04:27:21,610 --> 04:27:22,430
Who was it?

3159
04:27:25,590 --> 04:27:26,490
Kenjo!

3160
04:27:29,850 --> 04:27:31,650
Happy birthday.

3161
04:27:31,930 --> 04:27:32,550
Congratulations.

3162
04:27:34,030 --> 04:27:37,470
Happy birthday with salutations.

3163
04:27:37,850 --> 04:27:39,390
Happy birthday.

3164
04:27:39,850 --> 04:27:42,510
May your sky stay blue.

3165
04:27:45,330 --> 04:27:48,610
Happy birthday to you.

3166
04:27:49,150 --> 04:27:50,230
Happy birthday, Kenjo!

3167
04:27:50,510 --> 04:27:51,970
Sorry it took me so long to sing.

3168
04:27:51,970 --> 04:27:53,110
Happy birthday to you!

3169
04:27:56,190 --> 04:27:56,510
Okay.

3170
04:27:57,590 --> 04:28:00,090
I have another stream in about an hour.

3171
04:28:00,770 --> 04:28:02,890
So, I have to vacuum my room.

3172
04:28:03,430 --> 04:28:05,810
Because I got popcorn and I gotta change my dress.

3173
04:28:06,270 --> 04:28:08,250
Because I got popcorn all over it.

3174
04:28:14,400 --> 04:28:15,900
Thank you, Minto.

3175
04:28:15,900 --> 04:28:15,960
Thank you, Minto.

3176
04:28:22,820 --> 04:28:24,900
I still feel so...

3177
04:28:26,420 --> 04:28:28,040
I didn't mean to do that.

3178
04:28:28,540 --> 04:28:32,660
I meant to go back to the menu.

3179
04:28:35,360 --> 04:28:37,520
I still feel so many emotions.

3180
04:28:38,540 --> 04:28:39,380
But...

3181
04:28:44,340 --> 04:28:46,480
I love Metal Gear.

3182
04:28:49,140 --> 04:28:50,900
I love Metal Gear!

3183
04:29:05,790 --> 04:29:06,650
We know.

3184
04:29:08,190 --> 04:29:10,410
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted vectors!

3185
04:29:10,750 --> 04:29:11,290
Thank you.

3186
04:29:11,290 --> 04:29:11,490
Thank you.

3187
04:29:14,570 --> 04:29:16,750
I hope you guys enjoyed 4 also.

3188
04:29:18,990 --> 04:29:20,790
Gosh, it's almost been 4 and a half hours.

3189
04:29:21,050 --> 04:29:22,190
It doesn't feel like that at all.

3190
04:29:23,770 --> 04:29:25,990
I feel like I could go through it all over again.

3191
04:29:28,670 --> 04:29:31,690
I have more tears to cry!

3192
04:29:34,410 --> 04:29:35,610
It's a hell of a ride.

3193
04:29:37,210 --> 04:29:37,690
Man...

3194
04:29:39,250 --> 04:29:42,250
I just realized I didn't put on my headband.

3195
04:29:42,330 --> 04:29:42,630
I forgot.

3196
04:29:46,590 --> 04:29:47,370
Hold on.

3197
04:29:50,130 --> 04:29:51,890
Actually, I realized this too.

3198
04:29:52,110 --> 04:29:52,550
Hold on.

3199
04:29:54,750 --> 04:29:55,630
Watch this.

3200
04:29:57,390 --> 04:29:58,270
Look at this.

3201
04:30:00,670 --> 04:30:02,850
I think I forgot to put it on last time too.

3202
04:30:03,790 --> 04:30:05,170
Because I just get so...

3203
04:30:05,970 --> 04:30:07,150
Look, look, look.

3204
04:30:07,210 --> 04:30:07,370
Ready?

3205
04:30:07,790 --> 04:30:08,070
Ready?

3206
04:30:08,210 --> 04:30:08,530
Hold on.

3207
04:30:08,870 --> 04:30:09,490
Let me scoot over.

3208
04:30:14,740 --> 04:30:15,880
I can do this.

3209
04:30:16,420 --> 04:30:17,240
Okay, hold on.

3210
04:30:18,140 --> 04:30:19,040
Let me move it down.

3211
04:30:22,320 --> 04:30:23,600
I can wear it properly!

3212
04:30:24,300 --> 04:30:25,780
But it's so weird!

3213
04:30:27,240 --> 04:30:28,280
I can wear it...

3214
04:30:28,280 --> 04:30:29,840
It's like bouncing on my head.

3215
04:30:30,120 --> 04:30:31,280
I can wear it properly!

3216
04:30:33,580 --> 04:30:34,060
Maybe.

3217
04:30:34,060 --> 04:30:34,140
Maybe.

3218
04:30:36,420 --> 04:30:37,940
If I wear it down...

3219
04:30:37,940 --> 04:30:38,920
How low can you go?

3220
04:30:41,720 --> 04:30:43,020
I can wear it properly.

3221
04:30:43,240 --> 04:30:45,200
Oh wait, it's kind of like a little...

3222
04:30:45,200 --> 04:30:45,820
There we go.

3223
04:30:50,920 --> 04:30:54,060
Only this is like a newer feature of Youtube Studio, so...

3224
04:30:55,980 --> 04:30:57,840
I never thought to do it before.

3225
04:30:58,100 --> 04:30:59,820
And then I tried it the other day and I was like...

3226
04:30:59,820 --> 04:31:01,120
I have to do this on stream!

3227
04:31:01,120 --> 04:31:03,800
But it's kind of weird because the tie is now like...

3228
04:31:03,800 --> 04:31:04,520
Not...

3229
04:31:06,060 --> 04:31:08,100
But it's so awesome, right?

3230
04:31:08,300 --> 04:31:10,900
It's not perfect, but it works, I think.

3231
04:31:11,740 --> 04:31:12,440
It's so funny.

3232
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:14,260
I was like, wait...

3233
04:31:14,260 --> 04:31:15,340
I could have done this.

3234
04:31:23,250 --> 04:31:24,410
It's close enough, right?

3235
04:31:24,470 --> 04:31:25,130
It looks good.

3236
04:31:25,770 --> 04:31:26,850
Welcome to the future.

3237
04:31:28,610 --> 04:31:29,510
I'm scared.

3238
04:31:29,510 --> 04:31:32,870
Can I request that you wear the headband?

3239
04:31:32,930 --> 04:31:33,810
It's bald, Minto.

3240
04:31:34,450 --> 04:31:35,370
I wonder what would happen.

3241
04:31:37,590 --> 04:31:38,210
I'm scared.

3242
04:31:39,710 --> 04:31:40,970
3, 2, 1!

3243
04:32:02,040 --> 04:32:03,160
It's weird!

3244
04:32:07,940 --> 04:32:08,540
Okay.

3245
04:32:08,540 --> 04:32:08,720
Okay.

3246
04:32:11,620 --> 04:32:12,920
What's up, Minto, everybody?

3247
04:32:13,240 --> 04:32:14,480
She became zero.

3248
04:32:16,260 --> 04:32:16,540
No!

3249
04:32:26,490 --> 04:32:28,230
And soon we'll be a swagger.

3250
04:32:30,630 --> 04:32:31,090
And...

3251
04:32:43,400 --> 04:32:44,300
Thank you, guys.

3252
04:32:44,440 --> 04:32:44,720
Sorry.

3253
04:32:45,080 --> 04:32:46,220
Also, I should say...

3254
04:32:46,220 --> 04:32:47,260
I'm really sorry, again.

3255
04:32:47,580 --> 04:32:50,700
My freak out at the beginning of the stream.

3256
04:32:52,920 --> 04:32:56,080
I've been going through it a little bit, but we're okay.

3257
04:32:56,200 --> 04:32:57,000
And we made it through.

3258
04:32:57,220 --> 04:32:57,740
And we...

3259
04:32:59,800 --> 04:33:00,800
We persevered.

3260
04:33:02,060 --> 04:33:04,720
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it.

3261
04:33:06,920 --> 04:33:08,620
Yeah, we persevered.

3262
04:33:12,340 --> 04:33:13,760
It was funny?

3263
04:33:15,280 --> 04:33:18,760
Are my mental breaks funny to you?

3264
04:33:19,040 --> 04:33:19,700
That's okay.

3265
04:33:19,920 --> 04:33:20,840
You can laugh at me.

3266
04:33:20,940 --> 04:33:22,260
I'm here for the entertainment.

3267
04:33:25,720 --> 04:33:27,240
Everybody, point and laugh!

3268
04:33:29,040 --> 04:33:31,420
At the ghost, she's having a mental breakdown.

3269
04:33:41,400 --> 04:33:41,840
Anyway...

3270
04:33:56,660 --> 04:33:57,940
What was I gonna say?

3271
04:33:57,940 --> 04:33:58,540
I don't remember.

3272
04:33:58,700 --> 04:33:59,420
Anyway, okay.

3273
04:33:59,580 --> 04:34:03,000
If I see you in a bit, I'll see you.

3274
04:34:03,060 --> 04:34:04,800
And if not, then I'll see you the next time I see you.

3275
04:34:05,680 --> 04:34:06,700
Thank you, guys.

3276
04:34:07,080 --> 04:34:07,620
Bye-bye.

3277
04:34:07,760 --> 04:34:08,000
Bye-bye.

3278
04:34:08,160 --> 04:34:08,540
Bye -bye.

3279
04:34:08,740 --> 04:34:09,280
Bye-bye.

3280
04:34:27,120 --> 04:34:29,880
This is today's ending song.

3281
04:34:30,560 --> 04:34:37,920
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bye Bye-bye!
