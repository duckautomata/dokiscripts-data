Oh my god.

6
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,380
Am I dead?

7
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,200
God.

8
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,960
Oh god, what do ghosts even do?

9
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,900
Do I say boo?

10
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,240

11
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh god.

12
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,900
What's this?

13
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,200
Get a job.

14
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Excuse me?

15
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,500
Get a job?

16
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,200
Oh my god.

17
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
The audacity.

18
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,540
a moment to...

19
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,920
Oh my gosh!

20
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,580
Game!

21
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,500
I think I better get out of this weird forest.

22
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,980
I don't know why I am here.

23
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:42,200
But, um, I think the computer just set on fire, so, uh, let's just find the nearest town and, uh, set up shop.

24
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,120
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, listen, listen, listen, everybody, everybody, everybody!

25
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,760
I think I've got it.

26
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,100
I think I finally nailed it.

27
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,320
I think I finally have the sound!

28
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
You have to listen, okay?

29
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Everybody, everybody gather!

30
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
Everybody gather and listen, please!

31
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,820
Okay, okay, okay, here I go!

32
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,310
She's really good!

33
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,370
No, no!

34
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,230
It's all wrong!

35
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,770
I just can't get this sound right!

36
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,810
What's wrong with me?

37
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,010
Sorry, guys.

38
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,910
I don't know, recently it just feels like...

39
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,140
It just feels like...

40
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,830
It just feels like I haven't really...

41
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,770
Found my place yet, you know.

42
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,790
Don't really know where I belong.

43
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,250
I guess that's kind of the problem with being a ghost, huh?

44
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,830
It's just, I think it would be a lot of fun if I could find some friends to create music with, you know?

45
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,830
I feel the May Cafe would be pretty lively then.

46
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,750
I don't know.

47
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,750
Maybe I'm just feeling some ghostly blues, you know?

48
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,670
The booze!

49
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,310
But I know of you guys are here with me, too.

50
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,290
It'll still be a really fun time, so...

51
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:07,990
Thank you.

52
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,970
Let's take it from the top again!

53
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,610
Hey!

54
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,010
Hey!

55
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,550
Oh!

56
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,490
Oh yeah.

57
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,310
Oh yeah.

58
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,310
Break it down.

59
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,270
Break it down.

60
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,860
Um, yeah.

61
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,280
He's still there.

62
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,260
Staring at me.

63
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,620
Menacingly.

64
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,880
With like...

65
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
Look at that smile.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,180
I don't know.

67
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,660
Guys.

68
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
What am I supposed to do?

69
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,280
Talk to him?

70
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,020
Like we haven't had...

71
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,720
This is...

72
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,260
It's literal flesh.

73
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,780
When has an actual human been in this mid-cafe?

74
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't know.

75
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,580
I don't...

76
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,680
I don't...

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,780
What am I supposed to say?

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,060
Do I...

79
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,100
Do I possess him?

80
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
Do I...

81
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,940
Do I say boo?

82
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,760
Will he get scared?

83
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,400
Will he leave?

84
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
I don't know!

85
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,520
Okay.

86
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll be brave.

87
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,100
I'll be brave.

88
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Okaidinaasai masai gochidin sama, ojo sama?

89
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,780

90
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,990
They're still there.

91
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,110
Oh, we don't get many customers.

92
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,070
I mean, we get customers.

93
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,930
We don't get many.

94
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,790
Fleshy.

95
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,290
What do I do?

96
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,780
My name is Min Phantom.

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,120
Hi.

98
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,300

100
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,900

105
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,160
Conversation starter.

106
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,540
The weather.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,500
Happening.

Oh, so are you hungry?

111
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,680
Did you happen to think that this was a maid cafe, which it definitely is.

112
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,940
This is a maid cafe.

113
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,980
Did you think this was a maid cafe and you came to experience maid and food?

114
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,920
Surely?

115
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,020

123
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
Prime sounds like a good thing.

124
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,960
Like, it's prime.

125
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
It's peak.

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,120
It's peem.

127
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,720
It's, yeah.

128
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,760
October 1st, which has already passed, which...

129
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
Um, yeah.

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,180
Uh...

131
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:42,680
very tall 149 centimeters yeah that's this is all the mint phantom everybody yeah this is

132
00:10:46,020 --> 00:11:02,420
very tall no yes also don't ask about my weight why would you do that why would you do that why would you do that let's look at let's look at oh here i'm gonna zoom in a little bit more We'll look at one at a time, right?

133
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,480
You guys have short attention spans, maybe.

134
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah.

135
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,220
And then, you know, I have all of these already.

136
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,400
These are.

137
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,040
In fact, I feel I have seen a few people, maybe one or two, that have done the ghost and the sparkle together.

138
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,480
Where's my subway surfers?

139
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
You could literally get your phone.

140
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:56,980
out at any time but it's very rude I'm talking to you no way yes way yes way so if you're looking for something a little more for a cultured palette I would recommend the hashtag fantography for good for delicious art but I think sometimes people put things in there that might should go in another hashtag

141
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,240
It's a little scary in there, even for me sometimes.

142
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,920
And, of course, for the live stream, that's chef's choice.

143
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,520
Me, I'm the chef.

144
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,520
So, actually, you guys, we might be doing away with the Japanese hashtag on Mito Live.

145
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,780
And just sticking with hashtag Mito Live.

146
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,020
Just for consistency.

147
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,520
I do check both quite often, but I think we'll just keep it in the one.

148
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,400
What do you mean, doe?

149
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
It's okay, it's okay.

150
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Next, we have...

151
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,020
I have a plushie.

152
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,160
And if you have that plushie, I would like you to use hashtag mint to go.

153
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Get it?

154
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,660
It's like mint to go, but mint to go.

155
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,160
It's a pun.

156
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,040
But that thing is a very dangerous creature.

157
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,120
And, you know.

158
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:11,280
And also for general, we're keeping mint to shinde, shashin, but you can also use hashtag mint phantom that is fine as well and then you must be 18 years or age of oh wait wait 18 years oh i i made a typo

159
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,680

Also, if you ever want to make that thing, it's apparently bourbon and ginger ale and orange slice.

166
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,220
Yes.

167
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,620

I'm telling you, that thing is a gnarly ride.

193
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:45,160
You are not ready for it unless you've literally done every single thing that I told you to do in the mountains.

194
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,920
Then only then will you feel like you're prepared to take on the creature feature.

Oh, but look at this.

222
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,620
They wrote some really cute things.

223
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,220
likes of being silly.

224
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,360
Oh, my gosh.

225
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,760
Oh, being a silly otaku.

226
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,740
And cute girls and things.

227
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

228
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,840
Mount Fuji.

229
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,100
Oh, hmm.

230
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,940
Idols and being a otaku.

231
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, yeah.

232
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I get it, I get it.

233
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,340
Corn soup.

234
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Who wouldn't love corn soup?

235
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,520
Dad jokes.

236
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,320
I do love a good joke.

237
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,020
Yeah.

238
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
And E, E, E.

239
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,640
Hmm.

240
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,000
See, I've always heard that people don't like, you know, that feeling when you're like, E!

241
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,160
But liking E, E.

242
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,820
I get it.

243
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,600
I get it.

244
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,660
Hmm.

245
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,980
I think I understand.

246
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,740
But usually I hear people don't like E.

247
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,240
But I think I like E.

248
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
You know?

249
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,280
What's wrong with E?

250
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,960
E.

251
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,420
Ah.

252
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Of course, these things are all so relatable, no?

253
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
I think I love every single one of these things.

254
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
But actually, isn't that so silly?

255
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,980
Hmm, interesting.

256
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,060
Let's get this, let's also, isn't this spider just so cute, but like, they made a total mess of my, of my, um, my table.

257
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,400
I don't, actually, this is not even mine.

258
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,240
I don't know where this came from, so.

259
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, oh no, dislike, sad.

260
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,940
Spicy food?

261
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah, actually I can't have spicy food either.

262
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,680
You know?

263
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Messes?

264
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,960
Well, I'm a maid, so of course I hate messes and everything.

265
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,040
The jumpy kind.

266
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,060
Okay.

267
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,200
I have like so much...

268
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,180
Okay, like even ladybugs, you know?

269
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,680
I don't even like ladybugs because they jump at me.

270
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,340
Is that weird?

271
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,760
I like them from far away, but I don't like when...

272
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,580
I don't like bugs that go...

273
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,360
You know what I mean?

274
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh, hide berries.

275
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,060
Oh, oh,

276
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,970
you're not watching this, are you?

277
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,770
Whoa.

278
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,750
Anyway, um, wearing socks in bed.

279
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,270
Okay, I don't care how cold my feet are.

280
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,350
I don't care.

281
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,190
I don't care how cold my feet are.

282
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,890
I have to not wear socks in bed.

283
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,890
It's like the most uncomfortable feeling for me.

284
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,210
Like I'm always, I will take off my socks.

285
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:56,110
I'll be in bed and if I accidentally wear my socks, I'm like, Phoebe!

286
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,390
Grippers out always.

287
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,690
I gotta feel free.

288
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,890
Like, I don't know.

289
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,390
I wear socks all day.

290
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,410
So I really love the feeling of taking off my socks in my bed.

291
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,590
You know?

292
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,490
I don't know.

293
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,030
That's just how it is.

294
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:18,470
And then, when you don't bring offerings to me, of course, as a ghost, I need offerings.

295
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,290
I need sustenance to continue my ghostly, not life.

296
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:40,730
live it life so bring me snacks please and thank you okay what else we got here let's get my my very my thin books out of the way oh and

297
00:26:44,020 --> 00:27:01,080
oh i i i feel like these have not changed so much in in years i feel like i still love the same things even after all these years I even, like, kind of tried to make it a little smaller, you know?

298
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,760
So I love Steinsuke!

299
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,900
Did you guys see some of the Steinsuke references in the new opening?

300
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,800
And I love YuroKamp!

301
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,680
I love Yoruboy!

302
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,520
It plays further than the universe.

303
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,400
That's one.

304
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,440
I went to Antarctica because of that series.

305
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,120
I love...

306
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,020
I love...

307
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
I love...

308
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,460
Re-zero.

309
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:57,080
Okay, but Whatever Slop is fine sometimes I love Slop I love idle stuff like wug and iMass And iCarts I love a bunny girl senpai And I love a When They Cry series So I was a fan of Sotsu and Go When they came out Very happy Especially because Akio Watanabe Did the character design for that And so it was like Everything that I love All coming together Gather!

310
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,480
So, hmm, I feel like these haven't changed at all.

312
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,120
I think the only thing that's really changed about me is the games that I like.

313
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,400
It's funny.

314
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,280
I mean, I like what I like, so it's okay to enjoy slop.

315
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,300
I agree.

316
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,320
Everybody has a guilty pleasure.

317
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,520
You all are not innocent.

318
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,200
We're in this together.

319
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,060
And I know that because you're here.

320
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
Don't think you're better than me.

321
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,660
Don't act like you're better than me.

322
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,980
And last but not least, we have...

323
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,600
Let me move this cardboard box out of the way.

324
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,660
Oh, that's you.

325
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,500
Sorry.

326
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,620
Bye,

327
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,340
Ben.

328
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,760
Don't do this.

329
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,500
Don't leave.

330
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,080
I talked about Re-Zero once and you're already trying to skidaddle out of here.

331
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,960
Games!

332
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,840
Who's scribbling all this stuff on the table like this?

333
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,020
Gosh, you guys could never tell, right?

334
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,540
Because of the filter that I keep on the camera.

335
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,220
You would never know that all of this is on here.

336
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,940
We have Metal Gear Solid!

337
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,550
Metal Gear Solid series.

338
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,790
Maybe like a little bit.

339
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,210
Blue Archive!

340
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,790
I just did my dailies literally right before stream.

341
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,930
as I was panicking.

342
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,530
I was like, am I going to remember everything?

343
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,650
Am I going to remember everything?

344
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,350
Yeah, I think we're okay so far.

345
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:46,910
Maybe.

346
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,790
Maybe we're okay so far.

347
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,130
So far so good.

348
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,310
Ace Attorney series.

349
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,590
I really love Ace Attorney series.

350
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,890
I love horror games and I love puzzle games and I love horror and puzzle games.

351
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,630
But I also like them separate.

352
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,650
I love Blue Archive.

353
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,210
Oh my gosh, I'm a huge blue.

354
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,790
I don't even know if you could put that under games.

355
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,470
It's a mobile game, it's fine.

356
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,910
I love Toho!

357
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,010
Toho Project.

358
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,510
Konichiwa.

359
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,570
Watashiwa.

360
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:17,730
Mint Phantom.

361
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,490
Watashiwa.

362
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,110
Toho Project.

363
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:21,990
I like this.

364
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,270
Wait, the joke is it's supposed to sound like good Japanese.

365
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,750
And then Toho Project.

366
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:28,870
My bad.

367
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,590
Blue Archive.

368
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,630
And then I like visual novels.

369
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,590
Though I will say.

370
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,430
I like them.

371
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,210
I have not played so many.

372
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:43,450
of late because I am so busy, but I am always open to your suggestions.

373
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,330
Yes.

374
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,090
I should, I probably, I don't know.

375
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,710
Maybe I'll play when on the plane.

376
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,190
Or something.

377
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,590
So yeah, these are all the things I like.

378
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,270
Oh, I also forgot.

379
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,250
Oh my gosh.

380
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,690
So in the past, I've talked about having my MP3 player.

381
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:40,230
and um i've i've had it for like maybe 10 years now or something unfortunately when my last car died i stopped using my mp3 player because now with my new car i'm able to to hook up my um my phone to the car i know but what i have here as you could see is my Isn't it so cute?

382
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,830
Isn't it so cute?

383
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,570
Everybody say, sorry, I'm a little ghostly at the moment.

384
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,610
It's, you know.

385
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:57,890
But, yeah, I thought it would be fun to show some things that I would, like, listen to while, you know, driving around.

386
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
So, let's see.

387
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,630
It's actually in Japanese, not by, because I'm a weeaboo, which is the truth.

388
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,350
Because it was given to me by some Japanese organizers.

389
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,750
And it does not change to English.

390
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,930
It is only Japanese.

391
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,550
So that was fun.

392
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,490
Let's see what we got.

393
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,670
Okay, let's go to album.

394
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,930
And we'll just kind of go through some songs that I would listen to while driving.

395
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,130
So let's see.

396
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,990
I've got some AKB48 on here.

397
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:32,570
What I...

398
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:32,990
Oh my gosh.

399
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,790
I like to joke that this is like a graveyard of music.

400
00:32:37,810 --> 00:33:13,790
because there's so many idols in here so many groups and things that just don't exist anymore so like and also what's really cool is I have a bunch of like super indie idol group that I would like buy their CD and then rip it and just groups that also don't exist anymore but like I have like this little bit of history because because I own their stuff so it's kind of fun it's like it feels It feels like a very me type of mp3 player,

401
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,770
song choice.

402
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,930
So we have Dampagumi Inc.

403
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,610

404
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,370
Oh, I did click album.

405
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,090
We have Momo I Haruko.

406
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,650
Oh, sorry.

407
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:20,930
Hold on.

408
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,430
I'm trying to...

409
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,790
There we go.

410
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,370
That's better.

411
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:24,810

561
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,180
And they even included some things that I was like, oh, wow, wait, this was a good thing to include.

562
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,020
So many, so many little details, so.

563
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,160
Very fun, very fun.

564
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,600
I know, even Fatal Frame.

565
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,640
I didn't even ask for Fatal Frame.

566
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,120
And I was like, whoa!

567
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:35,380
So yeah, please enjoy the new opening anime because I love it so much I love love love it and yeah and then I did forget something that's okay though I'll do it after I'll do it towards the end and all credits will all be updated in the in the description after stream it wasn't because I was too busy to put them in before stream Congrats on the re-debute!

568
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,340
Thank you!

569
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,860

570
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,140
Thank you so much.

571
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,540
And so, I also wanted to talk a little bit.

572
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,140
I wanted to kind of, some people are probably like, why even are you debuting?

573
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,740
Like, what?

574
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,280
What is going on?

575
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,920
What is this?

576
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,360
So, what is Denzetsu.exe?

577
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:02,600
So Denzetsu.exe was created and, oh, it is also owned by me, Phoebe and Vicky.

578
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:58,760
So, the three of us we came up with with essentially everything like the concept and um and everything that all of our all of our ideas and everything came together through our brains um so we're we're a little we're a little some people describe us as an indie idol group an underground idol group um we just kind of wanted to have like a creative outlet with like um with like an idle focus kind of kind of kind of idea and um we do we have all we have full control over our image everything like we're weird though we're the brains behind this behind this gig and then you might be wondering well you are also working with satsuna who are they

579
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:34,700
um they're like handling communication related things i have a i have a manager now it's kind of nice so yeah these shady satsuna fellows i you guys feel like my like a dad who's just like i have to vet this person before you date them i have i need to vet this fellow but um but uh Yeah,

580
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:48,500
they're allowing us to focus more on our creative endeavors while they kind of handle the uh, the, the workload, the paperwork and things like that so that we can be more silly, goofy fun on stream.

581
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,140
And, and you can also get more fun things because there's other people handling stuff.

582
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,660
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,680
Are they good enough for our veto?

584
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,260
Yeah.

585
00:47:00,820 --> 00:48:07,000
So, um uh we are so if you still donate to me we keep all of streaming income so if you're just like where's my money going it's still going towards me and us and our projects so yes yes yes yes so that's just like a little brief um introduction to tinsetsu.exe and satsuna for everybody who is kind of like a little curious and weary and everything very optimistic and we're we're we're all it's a good people so yeah and I have just about 10 minutes left let's see I wanted actually let's head back to the maid cafe real quick because because there was one last thing I wanted to do as a maiden let's go Where am I?

586
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,740
Oh, gosh.

587
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,350
And...

588
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:17,770
Okay.

589
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,670
One last thing.

590
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,230
One last thing.

591
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:24,490
Wow.

592
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,610
Koshiditsaba, you fell asleep and you had a very strange dream.

593
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,350
Please, please try not to fall asleep at the table.

594
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,650
It's actually very meiwaku for our other patrons.

595
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,010
Definitely.

596
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,770
are here.

597
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,650
Yeah.

598
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:54,570
Anyway, because we don't get very many customers, many flesh customers, is it okay if I can say that?

599
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:03,070
I have a little checklist to go over so that I can be a proper maid.

600
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,310
I don't want to forget anything, you know?

601
00:49:04,310 --> 00:50:38,100
so um um oh how'd that get in there just uh uh don't worry about that worry about my dreams oh as you can see this was updated i literally wrote this list october 9th 2024 i have a i know that because that's the date that i posted it in discord yeah in my private like i have my own discord like that nobody else is in just me where i can like write notes i'm sure i feel like a lot of people have that so so some of these might be a little outdated um let's let's go through and then maybe we can make some new dreams and goals together if that's okay so first i want to collab with an idol group i want to collab with an idol group maybe like a Japanese idol group maybe some group that I really really love or something yeah that's been that's been a dream of mine for a really long time so yeah yeah yeah I want to see Minto cosplay and Dojin at Comic-Camp but I feel like I feel like I could cross out the Dojin at least the Dojin part because technically Ayami Mama has released a dojinchi of

602
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,180
me at Comic-Cat!

603
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,020
Or at least not, well, she released a dojinchi that I am in at Comic-Cat, so...

604
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,600
Yeah!

605
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,260
Guys, why are you blushing?

606
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,480
Dojinchi is not always so edgy, okay?

607
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah.

608
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,520
But...

609
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Well, I'll save this for later.

610
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,700
Then, we can cross out concert!

611
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,420
Cross out!

612
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,940
Cross out!

613
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,960
And do a 3D concert live!

614
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,520
I've done both!

615
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,300
That's kind of insane!

616
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,900
Oh, oh my gosh.

617
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,040
I can't believe it.

618
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,620
I can't believe it!

619
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,020
I can't believe I've done both.

620
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,560
Yeah!

621
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,380
This one might be kind of out of nowhere.

622
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,600
I want to learn how to DJ.

623
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,300
I kind of want to become like an Anikura DJ.

624
00:51:32,200 --> 00:52:04,200
And DJ at and like maybe host my own Anikura event one day which is like basically they just play anime songs and people do calls and are silly and it's fun yeah i'm into ab mogra one day one day maybe i also want to make a haunted house maybe at like like an event or something like even if it's just kind of i just want to design it you

625
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:24,660
I want to maybe one day make a haunted house And you guys go through it And then tell me it's 10 out of 10 super spooky I will make number 2 happen Well, I'll wait for it then Oh

626
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,850
I want to sing an opening song for a visual novel

627
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:42,770
Yep That is one of my goals One of my goals, one of my dreams.

628
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,370
That's also been a dream for a while.

629
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:57,350
And then I think the last time I met up with Ayami Mama, she was just like, she was like, Minto, my goal for you is to reach 1 million subscribers.

630
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:09,450
And I think that if I ever reach 1 million subscribers, then maybe I could probably ask Ayami Mama to make that kind of doji.

631
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,230
An official.

632
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:14,850
So...

633
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,910
We'll see if it ever happens.

634
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,140
That will be my 1 million subscriber goal.

635
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,060
And I would also like to get to 1 million subscribers one day because I've never had that many ever before in my afterlife.

636
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,700
So it would be really cool to see, I think.

637
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,500
Yeah!

638
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,080
Yeah.

639
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,080
And then...

640
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:49,620
My last final dream is to possess you and make you happy!

641
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,240
That's a Minto goal for me, Minto.

642
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,460
I wrote that.

643
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,800
Yeah!

644
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,860

And, you know, I won't do anything illegal.

648
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:13,490
Maybe.

649
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,850
