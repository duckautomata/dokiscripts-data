1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Our fan club's finally open!

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh yeah, we have one of those now!

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,480
It's gonna be the best place to get checkies from us!

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,680
Oh guys, wanna give people a rundown on what a checkie is?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,060
Sure, a checkie is a Polaroid photo that idols take for
fans.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,160
They're usually decorated and personalized.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,580
Our fan club's gonna have a unique checkie from us every
month.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,860
Yep, you can sign up on Patreon now to get our first set.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,340
What else does the fan club offer?

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,900
What a great and totally not planned question, Bickey.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,160
The fan club has a monthly postcard from us and stickers
too.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,000
Depending on your tier, you get different merch items
monthly.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,060
Each month we pick a new artist to draw us and design some
stickers.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,880
Then they get sent to you alongside the checkies.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,480
That's a great lead-in to introducing our artist for this
month.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,860
Are you ready?

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,180
It's kids!

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,220
She's drawn up a really pretty group pick of us performing
together.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,880
I think that it's the perfect way to kick off our club.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,460
There's worldwide shipping too, so don't worry about where
you are.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,660
Plus, she did one sticker for each of us to really bring out
our individual child.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Oh, they're so cute!

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
Remember, this postcard will only be available in January.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,400
Our spotlight artists rotate out monthly, so it's only while
they're around.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,860
But don't worry, you can get a digital background version of
the group art for your phone wallpaper or whatever.

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,820
That won't go away.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,040
The fan club's the best place to directly support us, so
we're really looking forward to having you be a part of it.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,060
Plus, members of the club will have exclusive pre-sale
access to any group shows we do, roles in the official
