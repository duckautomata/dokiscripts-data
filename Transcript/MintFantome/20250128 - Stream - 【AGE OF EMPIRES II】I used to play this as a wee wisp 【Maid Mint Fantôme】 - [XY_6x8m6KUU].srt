1
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
I forgot to turn the music on.

2
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,020
What do you

3
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,180
mean, why does G hate us anymore?

4
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,540
I start... I start... not exactly on time.

5
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
I think everybody's clocks are now slow.

6
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,440
Compared to my clock, which is... fast.

7
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,850
Where's the Minto on the thumbnail?

8
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,040
Oh, dead?

9
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,340
You're haunting our clocks.

10
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,140
Potentially.

11
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,260
Potentially, potentially.

12
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,200
Anyway, welcome to Age of Empires.

13
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,620
Do you know of Red Alert 3?

14
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,040
I feel like I've heard of it before.

15
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,860
Red Alert 3.

16
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,040
Plots are very silly as pretty military girls.

17
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,140
Feels like it'd be really up your alley for an RTS game.

18
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:18,040
I've seen some people in chat being like, Oh my gosh, RTS Minto, RTS Ark.

19
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,140
And I just want to say, whoa, that's...

20
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,820
Hold your horses a little bit.

21
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,980
A little bit.

22
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:57,820
You know, I enjoy these types of games, but I'm not quite so sweaty about them, so I fear that it might turn people off of wanting to Wanting to watch me Play them, you know, so But for now, I really wanted to play Age of Empires 2 because Because, because When I was a wee wisp I would sit in Papa Minto's lap and I would watch Sometimes control the mouse,

23
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:09,380
you know, like when Well, actually I went to, when I went to school I had a bus driver that would let the kids drive the bus But I think she got fired.

24
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,320
I was gonna say

25
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,000
It's like when the bus driver lets you drive the bus But I don't think that's That's the

26
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,820
Yeah, she would, she would, she would, you know She would press the pedals And then the kids would steer, right?

27
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:53,200
And And I think someone, I think someone snitched But they thought it was probably like Hey mom, my bus driver, today the bus driver let me drive the bus And the mom is probably just like What?

28
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:22,120
Yeah Anyway, well I was gonna say it's like that Oh, I know what I was thinking of It's like when you, when you were a kid and you would sit In the, oh my gosh, you know those You know those wheels that they put in carts Like a shopping cart And you pretend you're driving the shopping cart It's like that,

29
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:58,760
that's what it was It's me watching my, my papa play I would, I would, I would not actually be doing anything I was just But sometimes I do remember I would go into like the custom mode And I would do like one man versus like 15 Joan of Arcs and 25 elephants And every Every warrior and I'd put them on opposite sides of the map And I would see how long it took to To,

30
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,120
to reach each other You did that too?

31
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,960
There's no such thing as an original An original experience, is there?

32
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:33,560
Scenario editor was fun Yeah, I used to enjoy just kind of being goofy in there Taser is god tier song on the soundtrack No one beats the rumbling from my elite war elephants I believe you Everybody is saying references to things Being like, oh, Minto played Age of Empires Yeah,

33
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:59,340
when I was a babby But that's okay Maybe we'll understand later Age of Mint-par Shrinky But yeah, babu When I was just a little baby So, I can learn So you guys say all these references, I don't know right now But I will learn them

34
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,480
And, when was that?

35
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Last week?

36
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,360
Yeah, last week I wish

37
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:52,440
I, earlier, actually, I did the tutorial Most of it I did most of the tutorial, I didn't do this one But just to kind of get an idea of things I was prepared Because these also take a long time So I feel that maybe we can just jump into a campaign or something I don't know Maybe we can do the last one together Oh wait,

38
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:04,960
go away, go away This one, the battle Maybe The series has amazing cheat codes You know, I...

39
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Feel like I used cheat codes But But, maybe I'm confusing it with the Sims

40
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:31,400
I don't remember I might be confusing it with the Sims

41
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:50,180
AoE3 lets you summon giant George Washington bus that stomps on things What the heck, that's amazing Maybe let's play the game for real and then at the end we can do some silly cheat code stuff How about that?

42
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,640
I mean, it was my birthday over the weekend, may I ask for a song?

43
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:08,580
I'm traveling right now, put a few pics of traveling Minto on Blue Sky I have to check Blue Sky, I think I don't remember my Blue Sky login I was playing a bit of AoE as a kid, Wololo, but...

44
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,900
And I'm keen to see it again How do I say your name?

45
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,660
I hope I'm saying it right

46
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Happy birthday!

47
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:44,620
I do have a password manager, I'm just Emma I'm just not good about using it sometimes Also, ConfusedDude, welcome to membership!

48
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,060
And therapy, thank you for the superchat!

49
00:11:48,340 --> 00:12:02,160
Minto's Empire of Ocelots You spelled snakes wrong Sankies Sankies I wonder why...

50
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:12,920
So, maybe I'm just biased I chose Age of Empires 2 because that's the one I played as a kid But...

51
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,540
Is it like... I feel like it's the most popular one, right?

52
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:29,200
It's still popular It's also... It holds up so well as a game, I feel Did you ever play Age of Mythology?

53
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:53,640
Not as much as this one When I was a kid, it was Age of Empires, Diablo 2, Neverwinter Nights With my dad Those are like my three... Tomb Raider, a little bit I can't remember Oh my god!

54
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,220
I talked about this one before!

55
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,520
I talked about this one before Yeah, my dad was a gamer But...

56
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, Blade Runner is one that I talked about But I... There was a... What's it called?

57
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:17,740
Hold on A pirate's game that I used to play with my dad And...

58
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,400
Is he single?

59
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,340
No, he's dead

60
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,600
But he...

61
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,360
He...

62
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,520
He would play this pirate's game and I brought it up to my mom and my sister last time I saw them And I was like...

63
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,200
What was that pirate's game that we used to play?

64
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:54,840
I can't... I could not remember it and I could not look it up or anything And my sister, she was just like... Oh yeah, we used to play that How did you guys know?

65
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,240
How did you guys know it was Sid Meier's Pirates?

66
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,440
How did you guys know?

67
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,120
Why didn't you guys ever say this before?

68
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,840
Maybe you guys did say it last time I brought it up

69
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't know It's the pirate game But yeah, she was just like, it was this one.

70
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,760
I was like...

71
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,120
And I looked it up and I was like, it is that one!

72
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,740
I never asked Yes I did!

73
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,900
I have brought it up on stream before I have.

74
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,280
It's pronounced like shiver.

75
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,260
I'm sorry!

76
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,200

77
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,720

78
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,580
Oh no!

79
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,820
Oh sorry.

80
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,400
I see Minto with an army of cinnamoroll Wait.

81
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,760

83
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,620
Hold on.

84
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,940

Happy birthday to you!

89
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,960
But yeah, now I'm just like... I have to find a way... I don't think it was on Steam.

90
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,600
Let me see.

91
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,520
Hold on.

92
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:22,800
Cid?

93
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,700
I don't think so.

94
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,980
I think only Civilization is...

95
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,840
Oh shit sorry.

96
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm on the Plague Inc.

97
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Cid my... No only Civ... Civ... 5 Or is it?

98
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,240
It's on GOG.

99
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
It's on Steam now!

100
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,620
Pirates!

101
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh my god.

102
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,440
That's the game!

103
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,480
I have to play this one too.

104
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh my god.

105
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Why does it look so... It looks so crisp.

106
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,860
Like the graphics look so sharp.

107
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,160
I like how there is a pirate bundle.

108
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,180
Anyway.

109
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,120
I didn't realize it was on Steam.

110
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,580
Let's go.

111
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,080
Okay.

112
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
Let's do the tutorial.

113
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,500
Number 7.

114
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,960
The Battle of Falkirk.

115
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,680
Falkirk.

116
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,750
Will you check out the new Toho RTS?

117
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,070
The Toho Empires?

118
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,350
When it come... What?

119
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,910
What?

120
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,530
What is that?

121
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,110
The Toho Empires?

122
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,330
Goblin takes your six months!

123
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,820
Toho Empires.

124
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,800
Dang it.

125
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,060
Sorry I cannot spell.

126
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,180
Or rather I have no autocorrect on my phone.

127
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,340
Oh my god!

128
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,640
I want to play it.

129
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,300
It was my birthday yesterday.

130
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:02,920
Oh my goodness.

131
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,460
Too many birthdays.

132
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,880
Happy birthday to you.

133
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,540
Happy birthday to you.

134
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,560
Happy birthday dear Rumor.

135
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,840
Happy birthday to you.

136
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,840
Happy birthday!

137
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,220
And Pinkerton, thanks for the 5 gifted.

138
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,600
Thank you.

139
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
What was I going to say?

140
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,400
Oh yeah, someone said it's not an official game.

141
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,220
That's like most Toho games I feel.

142
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,580
I feel like 90% of them are...

143
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,620
Maybe not even 90.

144
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,940
99% of them are doujin.

145
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,380
Okay, Scotland forever.

146
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,540
Let's go!

147
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,340
The only...oh.

148
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:17,560
I saw my message.

149
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,620
I don't think I did Yoshi.

150
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,260
Oh, that's it?

151
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,560
Ok.

152
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,860
We must build a castle!

153
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,500
Wow!

154
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,120
Oh wow!

155
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,480
I do.

156
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Ok, we need more stone.

157
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,020
Do we have gold here?

158
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,960
The English can attack at any time!

159
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,260
Oh my gosh, another birthday!

160
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh gosh, I can't click on chat anymore or else it sends me into the Dark Ages.

161
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,760
Into the Shadow Realm.

162
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,160
But I can see because people are responding.

163
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,560
Dr. Kocho, happy birthday!

164
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,360
Happy birthday to you!

165
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,720
Happy birthday to you!

166
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
Happy birthday Dr. Kocho!

167
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,380
Happy birthday to you!

168
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,380
No!

169
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,380
We are getting attacked!

170
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,980
Oh my god, where are my people?

171
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,800
Where?

172
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:39,700
Where?

173
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,820
Down here!

174
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh my god.

175
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,530
Wait!

176
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,250
Oh my gosh, I accidentally clicked left click.

177
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm panicking.

178
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,610
Send my men!

179
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,990
No!

180
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,590
Oh my god.

181
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,250
We need...Oh my gosh.

182
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,550
We need more...more...more battle info...

183
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,290
Oh no!

184
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,110
Let's create like...

185
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,530
Let's create like...

186
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,530
Five...

187
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,270
The English are here!

188
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,250
The English are coming!

189
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh my god.

190
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,190
Can you like attack that thing?

191
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,830
You too!

192
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,250
You too!

193
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,670
You too!

194
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,070
You too!

195
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,610
Oh my god!

196
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,550
Oh my god!

197
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,030
Go out!

198
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,390
Oh my god!

199
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,770
They are attacking my stuff!

200
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,430
I'm getting attacked by the English!

201
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,390
Ok, can you like do anything?

202
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,590
Come on now.

203
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,110
It's time to...oh wait.

204
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,590
Hold on.

205
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,670
You do that one.

206
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,390
You do that one.

207
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,390
Ok.

208
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,390
The castle age.

209
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,670
Ok.

210
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,130
Are they dead?

211
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,910
No, we are.

212
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,530
Wait.

213
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,030
No!

214
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,190
My people are dead!

215
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,030
They are just chilling there though, so let's leave.

216
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,630
We'll leave.

217
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,450
We'll let them do whatever.

218
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,460
Ok, hold on.

219
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,050
Wait, there are more guys over here.

220
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,250
Oh my god.

221
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,230
What are you doing?

222
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,270
They are so aggressive!

223
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,750
This is nothing like the previous tutorials.

224
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,450
I was chilling!

225
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,770
What do you think he's doing?

226
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,270
What do you think he's doing down there?

227
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,210
Oh, he's gone.

228
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,270
He's coming to kill my people.

229
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,870
Hold on, let's send some people over this way.

230
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,910
He's hunting us!

231
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,970
Ok, he's like...he literally was just gonna come and sneak.

232
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,350
Oh my god!

233
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,550
What is he doing?

234
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,170
Hello?

235
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,050
He has no survival instincts whatsoever.

236
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,890
What about these guys down here?

237
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,570
Are they still here?

238
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,450
Yes, they are!

239
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,780
The monk is the one that goes...

240
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,220
Kill that guy!

241
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,420
Oh, they are still coming.

242
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,960
Go away!

243
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
I love their little skeletons.

244
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,300
Yeah, get his ass!

245
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,660
It might be a...it might be a...

246
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,040
It might be a trap.

247
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,860
Actually, stop, stop, stop.

248
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,380
No!

249
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,780
Oh my god, it was a trap!

250
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,480
Oh my god, I knew it.

251
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,340
This guy sucks.

252
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,740
Oh wait!

253
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
Attack him, attack him, attack him.

254
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,860
Attack him.

255
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,900
Oh, he's dead.

256
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,520
It was a trap!

257
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,520
It was a trap!

258
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,820
Ok.

259
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,100
We have more...more army being created.

260
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,520
Before, literally you guys, I was...

261
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,500
Wait, I should do what?

262
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,580
I should...

263
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,560
I have enough resources.

264
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh, let's go to the Castle Age.

265
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,600
Where is my town center?

266
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,040
Oh, here.

267
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Castle Age, baby!

268
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
I need more people.

269
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,220
This is ridiculous.

270
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,520
I was so chill the other...

271
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,920
Literally, the other...

272
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,260
Oh wait, I have two idle people.

273
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,320
Oh, chop down some wood.

274
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,840
Thank you.

275
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,680
I was chilling in the other tutorials.

276
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
And now suddenly...

277
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,620
Of course, as soon as I get on stream...

278
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,480
Oh, I don't have enough food.

279
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,100
We need more people.

280
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,660
We need more...

281
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,840
We need meat.

282
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,100
We need gatherers.

283
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,520
We need dudes.

284
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm gonna send this guy...

285
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,400
Here, go up...

286
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
What's our land looking like over here?

287
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,560
It's kind of the edge of the map, but I still want to see.

288
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,540
Maybe we can find some sheep.

289
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,120
We want some meat.

290
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,360
Send more dudes.

291
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,520
Let's just...

292
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,900
Oh, look at his trampling through our farms.

293
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,640
Oh.

294
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,600
It is...

295
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,880
We're landlocked.

296
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,640
What about in here?

297
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,040
We haven't even discovered our whole village.

298
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,160
That's it.

299
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm

300
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,980
gonna make more people.

301
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,060
Since we're getting more food.

302
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,460
Okay, let's go!

303
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,520
And then they said something about like...

304
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,580
Okay, build a castle and then destroy the English castle.

305
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,800
Oh yeah.

306
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,360
Didn't I create a guy?

307
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,540
Oh, it's creating now.

308
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,080
Okay.

309
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,760
Alright, lady.

310
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,640
Yeah, you're gonna build...

311
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,840
You're gonna build that.

312
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,600
The siege workshop.

313
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,040
You're gonna build it...

314
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,320
Guys, you're gonna learn I'm not good at placement.

315
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,540
Who's attacking me where?

316
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,000
Stop!

317
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,020
God, these guys are so freaking annoying.

318
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,860
Goodbye little outpost.

319
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,700
This guy is not doing anything.

320
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,080
Go kill that one guy.

321
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,480
Oh my god, they're leaving.

322
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,000
Are they leaving?

323
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,120
Maybe they're coming this way.

324
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,220
They might be wanting to attack us.

325
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,080
Oh my god.

326
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,740
Oh, okay.

327
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,300
That works, actually.

328
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,480
No, my scout!

329
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,340
He's dead.

330
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,040
Okay.

331
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,980
Battering rams.

332
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,180
Alright.

333
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,620
Good job.

334
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,120
Good job.

335
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,780
We're getting gold.

336
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,900
Do we have a...this is our marketplace, right?

337
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,400
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,460
Yeah.

339
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Tread cart.

340
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,860
What is this?

341
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,780
Oh, just a house.

342
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,580
It's so cute.

343
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,540
These places are so cute, right?

344
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,320
They're getting us wood.

345
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,740
The narrator is proud of me.

346
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,500
Oh, hey, hey!

347
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,000
Don't just stand around, buddy.

348
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,180
Let's get some more people.

349
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,180
For stone and for...

350
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,540
other stuff.

351
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
We're gonna also...

352
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,160
Oh, there's like baddies just...

353
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,480
Oh my god!

354
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,040
I think all my people are dead.

355
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,280
Oh no, they're not!

356
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,100
Lazy bones?

357
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,440
What are you doing over there?

358
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,420
Watching AoE2 competitive vids in 2020 is such a weird feeling.

359
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,120
Shh.

360
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,220
Oh, our outpost.

361
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,560
They're just destroying the wood by wood.

362
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,360
This sucks.

363
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,840
Yeah, take them down!

364
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,440
Hold on.

365
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,380
This one.

366
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,180
We're gonna upgrade, upgrade.

367
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,100
Love the thumbnail, it's so cute.

368
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,320
Thanks!

369
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Oh my god!

370
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,620
Do anything!

371
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,160
They're gonna destroy all our outposts.

372
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,660
Kill them all!

373
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
Kill them all!

374
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,940
Kill this guy!

375
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,420
Kill him!

376
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
Kill him!

377
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,500
Kill him.

378
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,700
Yeah, kill him too.

379
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,460
Yeah!

380
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,040
Yeah!

381
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,100
Yeah!

382
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
It's on fire.

383
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,620
Go back home.

384
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,800
It'll make it, probably.

385
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,020
It'll be fine, maybe.

386
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,380
We can get the long swordsman.

387
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,080
It sucks that there's like no sheep or anything around here.

388
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,960
Let's do...

389
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,260
Militia line costs, and the mine is 15 food.

390
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,260
And this one, they do more damage to buildings.

391
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,530
Oh, I have people that are bored.

392
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,770
Alright, I put you to slavery.

393
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,610
Actually, it's not really.

394
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,950
It's actually real honest work.

395
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Pikemen are goaded?

396
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:13,650
Are they?

397
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,350
Okay, we'll make a lot of them.

398
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,370
Create more pike... Oh, I have not enough wood.

399
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,590
I need more wood.

400
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,090
Many of you will die, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

401
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:24,910
No!

402
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,710
We need more wood.

403
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,250
Luckily, the tutorial allows us to have a bajillion people.

404
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,770
We have a real empire.

405
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,750
Look at all these guys chilling here.

406
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,950
This is the army.

407
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,250
I'm like, should I make more outposts?

408
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,270
Oh no!

409
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,310
He scouted my area!

410
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,510
Don't do it.

411
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,870
Don't do it.

412
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,260
People.

413
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,220
Okay.

414
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,120
Hello.

415
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,360
Go...

416
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,840
And you too.

417
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,940
Actually...

418
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,320
Yeah, we have...

419
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,680
We need more wood.

420
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,760
Can you pause the game?

421
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,150
Oh my god.

422
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,990
Run, run, run!

423
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,510
Oh, it's someone's birthday.

424
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,070
JSoul!

425
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,230
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.

426
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,250
Happy birthday to you.

427
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,570
Happy birthday to you.

428
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,750
F10 is to pause.

429
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,650
Happy birthday, JSoul!

430
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,290
Happy birthday!

431
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,550
Look, this is the most sturdy outpost ever.

432
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,250
It's amazing.

433
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,830
How it just stands.

434
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,370
I'm going to put...

435
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,070
I was going to say I'm going to put all my guys on that side, but I think we also need to finish our walls.

436
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,190
Okay, hold on.

437
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,610
Let's get a...

438
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,530
Let's get a... Let's make... Let's create life.

439
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,650
Let's create life and they will be our... Let's create two lives.

440
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,530
And also more pikemen.

441
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,510
Not enough wood.

442
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,370
Oh my gosh.

443
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,330
Oh, this too.

444
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,930
Okay, we created life.

445
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:38,670
Where?

446
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,190
These... Oh my gosh.

447
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,670
He saw that they were...

448
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,890
Alright everybody.

449
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,350
Go!

450
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:47,970
Go!

451
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,430
Go!

452
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,790
Attack this guy actually.

453
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,530
Oh no!

454
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,410
Why do they hate my outpost so much?

455
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,930
What do you mean I don't have enough wood for what?

456
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,110
Oh God!

457
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,790
It's falling!

458
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:04,850
It's falling!

459
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,710
Why didn't they see the...

460
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,690
I killed those guys.

461
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
You're outnumbered!

462
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,040
You're outnumbered!

463
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,700
Kill him!

464
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,260
Oh God!

465
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,060
More are coming.

466
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,840
Oh gosh.

467
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,100
They must be like right here.

468
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,420
The waters will turn red tonight.

469
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,880
With your blood!

470
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,660
Alright, let's go home.

471
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,080
Good job team.

472
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,040
They're coming.

473
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,120
We have people.

474
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,820
They're being created.

475
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,960
Slowly but surely.

476
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,750
We'll create more all purpose men too.

477
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,990
Build a gate?

478
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,010
Yeah, I'm working on it.

479
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,650
I'm trying to.

480
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,630
Every two seconds I get...

481
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,770
Wait, it's a...

482
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,750
No, not repair.

483
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
I mean I could.

484
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,570
It's kind of cooler though if it's not, you know.

485
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,770
Here it is.

486
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,710
A gate.

487
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,450
Wait, how do I... Oh, here it is.

488
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,170
Build gate.

489
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,750
Can be built into wall.

490
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,130
Oh, this one looks better.

491
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,350
Wait, so we build the wall... Wait, so do I build the wall first?

492
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,730
And then do I build the gate into the wall?

493
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,220
Yeah?

494
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,900
So like this.

495
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,880
Go build!

496
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,340
You too lady.

497
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,480
Everybody... You're going to build the other side.

498
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,380
OK ma'am?

499
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,960
Now put the gate.

500
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,920
Oh!

501
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,840
I see!

502
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,980
We have no more outposts.

503
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,840
We have to build our castle soon.

504
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,740
Let's see.

505
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,640
I need a little cavalry.

506
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,940
I'm going to create...

507
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm going to create a scout cavalry.

508
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,740
He's going to go searching for a bit.

509
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,700
Nice!

510
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,060
Look at them go!

511
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,360
Yeah baby!

512
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,780
Mind that stone.

513
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,120
Oh, we're almost out of stone.

514
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,920
The outposts were only holding us back my lord.

515
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,400
Build the castle in the swamp.

516
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,500
I want to build a little fishing area, honestly.

517
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,520
But they keep coming around here.

518
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,700
You know?

519
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,080
They keep coming to this side.

520
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,480
But I want to build a little dock and have some fish food coming in.

521
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,400
What if... Oh my gosh.

522
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,760
What if I'm a genius and I build the wall this way?

523
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,560
And then we get all of this.

524
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,200
We could do that.

525
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,300
Do it.

526
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,100
I will.

527
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
Oh my gosh, we have bored people.

528
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,380
Alright everybody.

529
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,880
Everybody who is bored, build a stone wall.

530
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,460
Actually, build a watchtower.

531
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,760
Do the watchtowers go inside or outside?

532
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,960
I mean, I know you can put them anywhere technically.

533
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,300
But what's the best...

534
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,760
Who is she playing as?

535
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,480
We are doing the tutorial.

536
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,880
Inside is better?

537
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,180
Okay.

538
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,200
Yeah, go build that, buddy.

539
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,860
Get inside.

541
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,260
Get inside.

542
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,240
It's not safe out there.

543
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,000
Eeyore, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

544
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,720
Thank you!

545
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,400
Thank you so much.

546
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,380
I really appreciate it.

547
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,020
Okay, and then the wall.

548
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,480
Oh my birthday!

549
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,920
P.K.A.

550
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,740
Happy birthday!

551
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,860
Happy birthday.

552
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,380
Wait, hold on.

553
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,280
The castle.

554
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,260
Oh we have plenty.

555
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,520
Okay.

556
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Happy birthday to you.

557
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,100
Oh my gosh!

558
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,320
You guys, go get this guy.

559
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,780
Go get this guy.

560
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,100
Happy birthday to you.

561
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,380
Happy birthday P.K.A.

562
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,180
Happy birthday to you.

563
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,700
Happy birthday!

564
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,480
Kick this guy's ass.

565
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,040
Where did he go?

566
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,540
Oh my god, he's a ghost.

567
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,280
Where the hell did he go?

568
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,660
Where did he go?

569
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,440
Yeah, I don't want him scouting.

570
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
Okay, we gotta build the wall.

571
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,780
We gotta build it now.

572
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,100
Alright, come here, come here.

573
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,380
Over here, over here, over here.

574
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,540
Alright, start building.

575
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,260
We're gonna build... It's a little unconventional.

576
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Like that.

577
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,660
Or like...

578
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,380
This uses less stone.

579
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,500
Okay.

580
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,400
Alright, everybody else is bored?

581
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,160
Yep, you too.

582
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,480
Go build it.

583
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,600
Go build that.

584
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,380
Okay.

585
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,300
Oh my god!

586
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,320
He's in my walls!

587
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,700
Guys, there's like ten of you.

588
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,280
Come on!

589
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,100
What?

590
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,840
Come on!

591
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,120
You guys too!

592
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,400
Go kill him!

593
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,830
Yes, good.

594
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,110
He's in my walls.

595
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,210
He's in my walls.

596
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,110
Okay, we're gonna have like the most secure...

597
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,590
We're gonna have the most secure place ever now.

598
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,090
Nobody worry.

599
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,230
Wait...

600
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,690
Oh my gosh, they're so fast.

601
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,230
Let's go.

602
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,570
And now I can... After they build the wall, we'll build the statue... Not statue, sorry.

603
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,850
We'll build the...

604
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,670
We'll build our castle right over here.

605
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,550
Wherever we feel like, honestly.

606
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,230
They won't be able to walk there.

607
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,730
I will shoot them if they walk in the water, okay?

608
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,010
Just don't...

609
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,610
We got some gold over here.

610
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,950
Oh my god!

611
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,850
Oh my god!

612
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,630
Oh my god!

613
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:21,950
Everybody!

614
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,210
Everybody attack!

615
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,450
It's okay, they're outnumbered in our society.

616
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,010
Let's build some more archers.

617
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,390
We'll do... These guys are probably fast, right?

618
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,870
Cavalry archers, regular archers, scrimmage archers...

619
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,810
We'll get some knights.

620
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,030
Oh, the round table.

621
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,210
Cavalry will move faster.

622
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,510
Oh, the research.

623
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,550
Look there.

624
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,790
Oh, hey guy.

625
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,990
Get back to work.

626
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,810
Get back to work.

627
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,270
If only we could have seen them coming.

628
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,530
We do, we do.

629
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,390
Look, they'll never be able to get in now.

630
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,690
Next is, once they're done with the wall, we build their castle.

631
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,970
We're gonna build it right... right there.

632
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,870
I wish I could chop down all these trees and build it in the middle.

633
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,170
I guess I technically could.

634
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,790
Boss, can we have some nanomachines?

635
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,150
This is the stone ages, I'm sorry.

636
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,770
You're gonna get rocks in your...

637
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,090
We have a scout?

638
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,570
We have a scout?

639
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,830
It's ok, he can't get in.

640
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,510
He can't get in.

641
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,190
See?

642
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,710
He can't get in.

643
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

644
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,650
You, you, you, you, you, you.

645
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,190
Hold on, hold on.

646
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,570
Build it like super fast.

647
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,290
Build it as fast as you can.

648
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,010
Build it, build it, build it, build it.

649
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,010
Build it, build it, build it.

650
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,150
Make 20 more villagers and that forest will disappear forever.

651
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,330
True.

652
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,410
This too.

653
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,530
We need to build scorpions, battering rams.

654
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,110
Ok, they built it a little too slowly, but we'll get them next time, boys.

655
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,330
Oh yeah, the dock.

656
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,810
Ok, I do want to build a dock.

657
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,130
Here, let's get her to build one.

658
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,010
Also, I want fishies.

659
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,950
There we go.

660
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,760
And you, all by your lonesome.

661
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,840
What am I running out of?

662
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,980
What do I not have?

663
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,820
Oh, wood.

664
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,760
Good thing a castle is only stone.

665
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,280
Oh, that's like the smallest thing ever.

666
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,240
It would have looked so good there, right?

667
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,920
Put it near the walls.

668
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,340
No!

669
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,400
Nice, we got a boat.

670
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,820
I'm gonna...

671
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,780
Put it close to the gate.

672
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:52,920
Wait, why?

673
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,880
Like here?

674
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,740
I wish I could turn it.

675
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,060
Can I?

676
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,400
It shoots arrows.

677
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:06,820
Ok.

678
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,780
Welcome to my abode.

679
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,270
It's a direct entrance to my home.

680
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,590
Alright.

681
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,330
Transport ship.

682
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:34,390
Trade.

683
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:35,970
Galley.

684
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,790
Warship!

685
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,950
This game taught me copy-paste functions with cheats.

686
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,130
I believe that.

687
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,170
Alright, ma'am.

688
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,390
You also go.

689
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,500
Ok, so far they've been quiet.

690
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,520
Too quiet.

691
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,400
Name it Minto's Evil Castle of Doom.

692
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,760
I will.

693
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,940
I'll name it that.

694
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,280
And another one?

695
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,020
Oh gosh, we need more wood for real.

696
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,620
Alright, I'm gonna make some people stop working on certain things.

697
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,420
Let's see.

698
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,640
How do I have zero people working on stone?

699
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,260
Where'd they go?

700
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,280
Uh...

701
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,520
I think they gave up.

702
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,780
We're gonna have you working on lumber now.

703
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,750
I think I accidentally selected them when we were fighting.

704
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,670
So, alright.

705
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,130
We need more food!

706
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,770
We need more food!

707
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,790
And we need more wood.

708
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,470
What?

709
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,610
There is wood.

710
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,110
That too!

711
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:54,910
They should thank him!

712
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,330
Sir William.

713
00:45:59,290 --> 00:45:59,790
Wow.

714
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,270
Research Stronghold.

715
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:07,410
Makes your castle and tower stronger by making them fire 33% faster.

716
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,650
And it heals!

717
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,410
Who's Wallace?

718
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,050
Where is he?

719
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,750
Wallace has come.

720
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:18,770
Where?

721
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:20,070
Where?

722
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:20,670
Where?

723
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,310
Oh my god!

724
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,130
Wallace.

725
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,030
Hello.

726
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,110
Hello my...wow.

727
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,530
Wallace brought it home!

728
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,030
One of your most powerful units is created at the castle.

729
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,190
Create ten more wood raiders.

730
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,170
Wood raider.

731
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:37,710
Ok.

732
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,430
And a petard.

733
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,630
What is that?

734
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:43,970
Demolition!

735
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,530
Did Wallace bring grommet?

736
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,690
Staff, thank you so much for the gifted!

737
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,450
Celtic Unique Infantry Unit.

738
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,890
Oh good, it's just gold and I have enough of that.

739
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,230
Ten of them.

740
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,860
Alright, get inside!

741
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,620
Get inside everybody!

742
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,500
Even the boats.

743
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,200
This guy is really trying.

744
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:23,840
No, no, no.

745
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,320
Come over here.

746
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,800
Wow.

747
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,140
Can ghosts be a little rude?

748
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,220
With William Wallace and his wood raiders on your side, the English may be in trouble.

749
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,480
Once you have a large army with plenty of siege weapons, go destroy the English castle.

750
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,880
Ok!

751
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,580
Oh my gosh.

752
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,220
Exciting.

753
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,260
Sorry, my cough is a little... It's been getting kind of not great recently.

754
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,820
I'm not quite sure why.

755
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,960
Ok, we'll do like what?

756
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,080
Two battering rams.

757
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,160
This thing.

758
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,880
We need more wood.

759
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,920
Not enough wood.

760
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,090
That's the plague.

761
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:09,490
Maybe.

762
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:11,830
Maybe.

763
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,450
Wait, I don't have enough wood to make a new farm?

764
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,650
Uh oh, we are in big trouble.

765
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,370
Let's also... I think we need some more gold.

766
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,470
You can upgrade your stuff.

767
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,490
Like what?

768
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,590
What should we upgrade?

769
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,510
What do we upgrade?

770
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,510
Look at all these guys.

771
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:37,390
Wow!

772
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,370
We got a huge army baby!

773
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,910
We are not broke.

774
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,410
We are working on it.

775
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,490
He's got... Uh oh.

776
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,550
Oh my god!

777
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,510
Took him down.

778
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,950
Easy peasy style.

779
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,410
I want to see his little body decay into the sand.

780
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,630
There he goes.

781
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,390
There he goes.

782
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,130
Turn into a skeleton.

783
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,570
Return to the earth.

784
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,900
There he goes.

785
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,000
Should I build a... What's it called?

786
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,960
A place of worship?

787
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,520
So we can have a Wololo man?

788
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,980
I know this is just a tutorial.

789
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,960
I shouldn't go so hard on the tutorial.

790
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,880
But it's fun too.

791
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,060
Okay lady.

792
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,660
All by yourself.

793
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,900
You're gonna build a monastery.

794
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,040
Kill him!

795
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,660
Oh my god.

796
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,000
He really was trying.

797
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,000
He's ghost powered.

798
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,760
Oh yeah.

799
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,420
I'm gonna build a monastery.

800
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,960
All by yourself.

801
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,360
You'll build it.

802
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,620
I believe in you lady.

803
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,060
Okay.

804
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,480
Do it!

805
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,560
With your own hands!

806
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,410
Okay, they're gonna kill him.

807
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:20,890
Oh damn.

808
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,470
Holy...

809
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,990
These scouts won't have anything to come back to.

810
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,270
Or rather...

811
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,310
They won't be able to say like...

812
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:37,810
Why did I make you guys chop down the trees so far away?

813
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,870
I think I'm stupid.

814
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,550
Here lady.

815
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,530
Go chop down this one instead.

816
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,090
We have our builder!

817
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:49,610
Okay.

818
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,970
We can make more stone maybe.

819
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:54,830
Or actually...

820
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,350
Do that.

821
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,870
Create the monk!

822
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,070
Mint is attacking the English?

823
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,510
Should I leave?

824
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,570
No...

825
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,850
Construct additional pylons.

826
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,550
Wrong game!

827
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,070
They're really coming to seek us out.

828
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:23,230
They're trying to get a little peek on us you pervs.

829
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,190
My walls are strong.

830
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,110
And my army is stronger!

831
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,200
I know I should build more army people.

832
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,860
We have a monk!

833
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,340
Oh!

834
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,620
Is it this one?

835
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,020
I wonder how...

836
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,860
That's not very...

837
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,700
Priestly of you.

838
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,520
Monk?

839
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,720
Or monkly of you.

840
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,220
Sorry, I know you guys like spam...

841
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,780
Not spam.

842
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,260
Like show like...

843
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,280
You guys are like...

844
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,800
You type in...

845
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,160
11!

846
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,040
Where do I even type those?

847
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,080
I'm not a hotkey type of person.

848
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,200
I'm not very good at remembering those.

849
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,040
So I apologize.

850
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,760
Press enter.

851
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,040
Hi chat.

852
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,140
Wait.

853
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,080
Press enter then 11.

854
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,810
What happened?

855
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,280
I like the sound.

856
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,800
The only RTS game I've played is Lego Battles for the TS.

857
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,520
Try 22.

858
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,520
Is there something that's supposed to happen?

859
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,080
With multiplayer only.

860
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,240
I like to do multiplayer with like...

861
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,220
You know, play this with some people.

862
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:13,840
Someday.

863
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,140
I think it'd be fun.

864
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,760
We're almost out of gold on this side.

865
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,020
But luckily we have another place over here.

866
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,660
With more gold.

867
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,120
What just happened?

868
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,940
Oh, I created a thing.

869
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,320
What the?

870
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,580
Oh my god!

871
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,790
They're trying to get our walls!

872
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:40,470
Wait.

873
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,630
I'm gonna go...

874
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:42,670
This guy.

875
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,370
I think I killed him instead.

876
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,090
He's healing them!

877
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:57,970
Good job.

878
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,350
Oh, I did convert him.

879
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,970
Okay, now you'll get healed.

880
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:03,930
Or not.

881
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:04,930
Heal?

882
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:05,810
Where are you?

883
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,770
He's working.

884
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,470
Okay, we built our castle.

885
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,510
We're building our army.

886
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,770
Upgrade.

887
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,530
I'm checking on making sure we have enough gold and everything, you know.

888
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,270
Do more damage to buildings?

889
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,570
Sounds good to take down a castle.

890
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,110
Get converted!

891
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:26,750
Get converted!

892
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,590
Get converted!

893
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,330
Let's create light cavalry.

894
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,710
Which are stronger.

895
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,590
I like stronger.

896
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:35,590
Hello.

897
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,630
Let's create a knight.

898
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,530
Everybody is chopping down.

899
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:45,290
We're deforestating the whole world.

900
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,850
We'll get our...

901
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,990
Actually, we have quite a bit of food, so this is easy to research.

902
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,710
We'll research everything that doesn't require gold.

903
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,790
Yeah!

904
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,400
We're winning the tutorial?

905
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,400
We're winning the tutorial!

906
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,960
It didn't sound like...

907
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,000
It didn't sound like a wololo, though.

908
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,900
I didn't hear him say it, though.

909
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,540
Was he supposed to say a wololo?

910
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:17,980
Wololo.

911
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,000
This counts as beating the game.

912
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,740
Oh, my ships are still gathering food.

913
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
Very good, very good.

914
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,960
Let's get more...

915
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,160
This one.

916
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:37,960
A galley.

917
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,620
And then upgrade to a war galley!

918
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,760
Wait, I think I'm gonna get more people.

919
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,040
Wait, we're all...

920
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Nevermind, hold on.

921
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,500
That's a bush.

922
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,580
Because...

923
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,180
You guys think this is enough?

924
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,500
You think this is enough people to fight?

925
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,660
Yes?

926
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,320
Bring them over here.

927
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,140
We'll gather all our team together.

928
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,740
Gosh, these guys are slow.

929
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,620
Oh, we have these guys too?

930
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,160
Holy moly.

931
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,700
Maybe...

932
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,780
Everybody gather on this side.

933
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,120
He's healing!

934
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,820
Do your thing, monk.

935
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,200
Do your thing, monk.

936
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,480
Yeah,

937
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,180
kill that guy.

938
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,480
Alright, everybody come over here.

939
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:56,880
That's...

940
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,880
That is our meet-up point.

941
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,420
I also don't...

942
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,000
60!

943
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,420
I don't quite understand also...

944
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,960
The formations.

945
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,160
But we'll get there.

946
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,600
Nobody is left behind!

947
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,960
Yeah, we missed a ram.

948
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,040
We got him.

949
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,980
Nobody is left behind.

950
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,640
We're going off to war!

951
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,680
Fear not, peasants!

952
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,960
We will be back with many riches!

953
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,200
Riches!

954
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,680
Now I want a Wololo alert.

955
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,580
Crossbowman!

956
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,180
He got left behind!

957
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,380
Going the long way.

958
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,940
Yeah, but we got to go with our ships.

959
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,540
We got to go with the ships.

960
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,860
It's more epic this way too, right?

961
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,780
Everybody can fit through the gate now, right?

962
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,790
Maybe I should bring another Wololo.

963
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,270
Units are 15% harder.

964
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,050
My guys are not weak.

965
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,830
My guys would not get converted.

966
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:13,930
Uh-oh.

967
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,310
Oh, we have Stormtrooper in.

968
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,010
Fire this guy.

969
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,010
What the hell?

970
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,670
Oh my god, he missed every single shot!

971
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,290
Wololo is combat.

972
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,090
I watched...

973
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,050
again the other night.

974
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,750
Just because I felt like it.

975
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,030
I watched Top Gun Maverick.

976
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:37,910
And I was just like, oh yeah.

977
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,430
Top Gun DLC is combat.

978
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,550
I was like looking up the guns and everything.

979
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,250
Oh, let's kill that guy.

980
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,130
Nevermind.

981
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,530
Oh no, they are going to see our army!

982
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,290
Kill him!

983
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,630
Kill him!

984
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,110
Take him down!

985
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,850
He cannot report back!

986
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,750
Oh my god.

987
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,470
Take him down!

988
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,110
They can't know that we are getting ready to attack.

989
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:04,510
Alright.

990
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:05,830
Alright team!

991
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,430
Let's go!

992
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,130
Oh wait, hold on.

993
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,050
I can't highlight all of you at once.

994
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,050
Ok, hold on.

995
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,730
You guys...

996
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:15,030
Alright.

997
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,050
We are going to go take down a whole empire.

998
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,110
A range of empires.

999
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:22,670
Right?

1000
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,390
Alright everybody.

1001
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,850
Oh, who did I miss?

1002
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,590
I can't get the boats and the guys at the same time.

1003
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,790
This is so sad.

1004
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,270
Boats...

1005
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,270
I think I...

1006
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,390
Oh I can only do 60 max.

1007
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,430
Ok.

1008
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,250
Let's go!

1009
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,190
Forward march!

1010
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,350
Hold on.

1011
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,530
Let's get our other guys too.

1012
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,110
Going in.

1013
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,130
Alright!

1014
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,390
Onward!

1015
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:11,690
Music...

1016
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,070
Oh my god!

1017
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:15,270
Sorry buddy.

1018
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,510
You are...

1019
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,310
So dead.

1020
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,710
They were trying to steal our stone!

1021
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,310
This is our stone!

1022
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,190
150 gifted.

1023
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,450
Thank you!

1024
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,910
This is our stone!

1025
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,550
Rock and stone!

1026
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,430
Oh gosh.

1027
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:53,910
How many monkeys does it take to kill one little guy?

1028
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,270
Alright, come on!

1029
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:56,330
Keep going!

1030
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,830
Keep going!

1031
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,670
Keep going!

1032
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,590
I'm confusing them a little bit but that's ok.

1033
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:01,790
There they are!

1034
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,330
Right across the way.

1035
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:07,370
Keep going!

1036
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,140
Keep going!

1037
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,540
They all have to like regroup.

1038
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,380
They all have to regroup and stuff.

1039
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,200
Here we go!

1040
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,800
Kill them!

1041
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,480
War!

1042
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:27,920
War!

1043
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,740
War is upon us!

1044
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,360
Can I have the bow?

1045
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,740
Take out the...

1046
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,840
Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,930
Start taking out the...

1048
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,720
I don't think that worked.

1049
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,000
You start taking this out.

1050
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,180
Take out the gate!

1051
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,760
Take it down!

1052
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,600
Take it down!

1053
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,500
Oh my god.

1054
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:58,940
Oh my god.

1055
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,820
I'm scared you guys.

1056
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,080
They seem pretty well off.

1057
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,520
They seem pretty advanced I'm just gonna say.

1058
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,840
Oh gosh!

1059
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,380
Are half of my guys even doing anything or...

1060
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,860
Oh my god!

1061
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,940
They got in!

1062
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,620
Oh my god.

1063
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,820
They got in.

1064
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,240
They got in.

1065
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:20,700
They got in.

1066
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,240
Don't die!

1067
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:21,600
Don't die!

1068
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,000
Don't die!

1069
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,360
I think you can just...

1070
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:31,840
Take it down!

1071
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,500
What are you doing?

1072
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,580
Take it down!

1073
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,920
Take it down!

1074
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,320
Forward!

1075
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,540
To victory!

1076
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,150
I'm gonna miss my bolts.

1077
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,480
It's so loud.

1078
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,320
Attack!

1079
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,640
Alright, let's go start attacking...

1080
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,540
Where is their castle?

1081
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,840
It's probably really puny and ugly, right?

1082
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,140
It's probably really stupid.

1083
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:22,740
No, no, no.

1084
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,280
Come this way.

1085
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:23,580
This way.

1086
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,900
It's probably so stupid.

1087
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,760
Okay, everybody in!

1088
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,020
In!

1089
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,220
In!

1090
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:29,560
In!

1091
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,600
Oh, where is their castle?

1092
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,120
Just attack anything I suppose.

1093
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,700
No, what are you doing?

1094
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,200
Come on!

1095
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,360
Get inside!

1096
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:40,840
Get inside!

1097
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,440
Inside!

1098
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:44,880
Inside!

1099
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,660
Platoons by holding CTRL 1 through 9.

1100
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,220
Okay, I'll have to try that.

1101
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,480
We're just attacking anything at this point.

1102
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,080
We have no sense of...

1103
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,880
No sense of...

1104
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,520
Anything right now.

1105
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,880
No, no, no...

1106
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,460
Oh, there it is!

1107
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,720
There it is.

1108
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,940
Yeah, keep attacking that thing.

1109
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,680
You got this.

1110
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,900
Everybody in!

1111
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,540
Everybody in!

1112
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,820
Everybody to the castle!

1113
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,880
Everybody... Oh no!

1114
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:25,760
Oh no!

1115
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,040
Oh no!

1116
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:28,860
Oh no!

1117
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,360
Don't just attack houses!

1118
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,660
Everybody attack the castle!

1119
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:43,170
Oh gosh, they're really shooting at us though.

1120
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,170
I'm scared.

1121
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,510
I'm scared.

1122
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,590
Did I miss any men?

1123
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,070
Yeah.

1124
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,490
Come on men!

1125
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,920
Hello Raiders!

1126
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,880
We are overthrowing the English today!

1127
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,900
The Boston Tea Party is now!

1128
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,240
Thank you for the gift!

1129
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,940
Thank you guys.

1130
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,140
Sorry, I was a little stressed trying to get in here.

1131
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,920
And the victory is ours!

1132
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,260
It crumbled!

1133
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,240
The English castle at Falkirk is no more.

1134
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,040
The English pretensions in Scotland are surely at an end.

1135
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,040
The forces of Wallace are triumphant.

1136
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,560
Yippee!

1137
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,920
Complete the William Wallace campaign.

1138
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,780
Thanks William Wallace!

1139
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,280
It did.

1140
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,360
Yeah!

1141
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,680
We were victorious.

1142
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,680
The English castle was torn down and a Scottish one shall be built in its place.

1143
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,160
William Wallace has shown us the path to victory.

1144
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,180
Although he is but one man, he inspires great deeds in others.

1145
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,780
Many of the Scottish knights and lords have drawn their swords with his.

1146
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,060
Wallace's own sword is a five and a half foot beast.

1147
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:23,980
Five and a half?

1148
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,980
Does he think he is some sort of anime protagonist?

1149
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:28,640
What is it?

1150
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,340
He has sworn not to rest until his sword finds the neck of Edward Longshanks.

1151
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,640
Oh we are going to kill that guy.

1152
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,300
The struggle will continue, but we have learned the ways of war.

1153
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, kind of.

1154
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,440
Now it is the English who will prove you wrong.

1155
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,220
Wallace Strife.

1156
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:49,840
No!

1157
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,100
They beat us in society!

1158
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,840
Oh wait, it's a tie.

1159
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,240
William Wallace, you need to really pull up, ok buddy?

1160
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,040
They beat us in technology!

1161
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:03,800
No!

1162
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,400
We are the MVP though.

1163
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,020
Yippee!

1164
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,440
They lived in a society.

1165
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,540
Ah, truly.

1166
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,640
That was so good!

1167
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:28,870
I saw... ok.

1168
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:32,050
Someone tried to explain to me how to select...

1169
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:32,230
Hello?

1170
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:32,990
Oh.

1171
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,750
Wait, why am I here?

1172
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,590
Did I accidentally click back to map?

1173
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,790
You can still hear it on fire.

1174
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:50,090
Ok, how do I get home?

1175
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,410
To the main menu.

1176
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:53,650
Quit current game.

1177
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:57,770
Ok, return to campaigns.

1178
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,230
That's why.

1179
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:59,570
Ok, yay!

1180
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:03,970
General Minky of the Scots truly brought an age of empires.

1181
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,350
Is that the thing?

1182
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,660
Well now, we have all of our campaigns.

1183
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,200
Wait, these are European campaigns.

1184
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,340
African campaigns.

1185
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,100
America campaigns.

1186
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,740
Asian campaigns.

1187
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,360
That's a turtle!

1188
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,310
Europe.

1189
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:29,770
Western Europe.

1190
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,450
Eastern Europe.

1191
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,030
South Asia.

1192
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,210
Caucasus.

1193
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,050
I don't have these ones.

1194
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,950
Turtle battle.

1195
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:46,050
Maybe I will stick with the... I don't know.

1196
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:46,830
I have no idea.

1197
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,610
I have no idea.

1198
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:51,950
Hold on.

1199
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,510
Let me see this real quick.

1200
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,640
I hate YouTube.

1201
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:00,300
Oh my god.

1202
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,300
It won't let me just...

1203
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,720
It won't let me click on a thing super chat.

1204
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,180
I wanted to read it.

1205
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,740
I was in the midst of war.

1206
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,840
I can't click it.

1207
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,920
I think I got it.

1208
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,680
Oh, it was the wrong one.

1209
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,120
Anyway, thank you for all the super chats, you guys.

1210
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,560
I appreciate it so much.

1211
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,180
Thank you.

1212
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,720
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1213
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:25,760
Okay.

1214
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,140
I like having Joan of Arc, I think.

1215
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:35,740
But I feel like I remember doing that one as a kid.

1216
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,080
I want to try something.

1217
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,740
I mean, I don't know what I haven't done because I...

1218
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,300
Dracula!

1219
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:46,700
Dracula!

1220
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,840
Vlad Dracula!

1221
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,920
But will they be enough to parry the Turkish onslaught?

1222
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,340
In this campaign, you may play as the Turks.

1223
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,440
The Magyars.

1224
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,800
Sorry guys, I don't know how to read.

1225
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,460
And the Slavs.

1226
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:20,920
Wallachia.

1227
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,620
Thank you.

1228
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:26,540
Wallachia.

1229
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,020
Wallachia.

1230
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:27,960
Wallachia.

1231
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,100
Shall we play Dracula?

1232
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,580
The Forgotten Campaign.

1233
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,680
1448-1477.

1234
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,200
Play as the Turkeys.

1235
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,260
Heck yeah!

1236
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,300
Let's do it!

1237
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,260
The dragon spreads his wings!

1238
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,100
We have the Ottoman Empire.

1239
01:10:59,280 --> 01:10:59,740
Hungary.

1240
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,420
Wallachia.

1241
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:06,680
You should play Red Alert sometime if you enjoy, especially Red Alert 3.

1242
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,100
Oh yeah, someone was mentioning that earlier.

1243
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,020
Moss.

1244
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,980
Dragon!

1245
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,880
Oh my God we got wolves!

1246
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,020
Oh we are just going to take it.

1247
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:12,740
Hell yeah!

1248
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,300
Sniper Wolf!

1249
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,920
Oh my God!

1250
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,900
Stand down fellows.

1251
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,240
Wallachia.

1252
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,160
Wallachia.

1253
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,720
He calmed them and satiated their hunger.

1254
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,240
Then he turned to us.

1255
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,040
Welcome to Pojenary Castle.

1256
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,880
Ancient stronghold of the Drachulesti.

1257
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,400
Wow!

1258
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,460
Cool!

1259
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,180
Vlad Dracula must survive.

1260
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,440
That's our only objective.

1261
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,460
Is that him?

1262
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:35,800
Okay.

1263
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,540
Oh I see them on the minimap.

1264
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,100
I visited the real castle of Vlad Dracula.

1265
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,220
I want to go.

1266
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,600
Are you my friend?

1267
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,260
And you're my friend.

1268
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,600
And you're my friend.

1269
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,060
Wow, nice place.

1270
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,020
Okay, spoilers.

1271
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,640
Their horses are so cool.

1272
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,740
They got like the little wings on them and everything.

1273
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,040
Alright.

1274
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,360
Men at arms!

1275
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,420
Men at legs!

1276
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:23,680
Men at feet and hands and fingers and toes.

1277
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,640
Bodies.

1278
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,680
Thorax.

1279
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,340
Shoulders.

1280
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,160
Necks.

1281
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,620
We gather together.

1282
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,460
And we form one man.

1283
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,480
And we will fight!

1284
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,720
Oh, that's not our friend.

1285
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,520
That is foe.

1286
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,600
That is foe.

1287
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,620
That must be foe.

1288
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,720
We'll go this way.

1289
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,300
Ignore us.

1290
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,940
Ignore our giant army.

1291
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,540
Ignore our giant army.

1292
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,360
Oh god, they're fast.

1293
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,720
We're right outside the gates!

1294
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,800
Oh, I have a mama.

1295
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,700
Alright everybody, let's keep going.

1296
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,620
Everybody survived.

1297
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,120
We're good.

1298
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:23,980
We're strong.

1299
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,700
My Romanian genes make me proud when I see my Oshi try and pronounce Romanian words.

1300
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,780
I want to learn.

1301
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,540
Hello friends.

1302
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,540
Don't attack.

1303
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,640
We come in peace.

1304
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,640
Even though we're...

1305
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,500
I kind of...

1306
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:56,440
I kind of also want to do not just a campaign, you know?

1307
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,900
Kill that guy.

1308
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,820
That doesn't sound very good.

1309
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,600
Let's keep getting more army.

1310
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,840
Not a custom game, but like a random map.

1311
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,140
I think we gotta kill this guy.

1312
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,480
Where's our monk?

1313
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,520
Convert the horse!

1314
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,020
Maybe... We converted something maybe.

1315
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:29,920
I'm not quite sure.

1316
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,040
Oh my god, they keep coming.

1317
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,040
Oh my god, they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming.

1318
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,740
Oh wait...

1319
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,220
Oh my god!

1320
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,520
Vladislav!

1321
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,540
It's an ambush!

1322
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,240
Where's Vlad Dracula?

1323
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,380
There he is.

1324
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,760
He's still alive.

1325
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,500
He's still healthy.

1326
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,860
Can you convert some guys?

1327
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,700
Convert him.

1328
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,760
Convert!

1329
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,540
Ok, you're dead.

1330
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:02,980
Nevermind.

1331
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:04,940
Convert you!

1332
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,400
You're dead.

1333
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,980
Are your guys gonna do anything or like...

1334
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,880
We've lost many men.

1335
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,980
Thank you!

1336
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,100
Oh, we got all of them now.

1337
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:31,460
Let's go.

1338
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,080
He's healing us.

1339
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:35,900
He's healing us.

1340
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,660
Let's keep going.

1341
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:38,700
Onward.

1342
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:44,140
But yeah, I kinda wanna do one of those like you build your civilization from the ground up kind of maps.

1343
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,180
Maybe after this campaign.

1344
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,800
After we get the armies and stuff.

1345
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,700
Yeah, I wanna do one of those.

1346
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,100
Not like story mode, you know.

1347
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,540
He said he will follow you but didn't follow him.

1348
01:17:59,600 --> 01:17:59,960
I know!

1349
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,900
What the heck, man!

1350
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,020
Uh oh.

1351
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,080
Those are not friends.

1352
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,260
Convert!

1353
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,340
And you're dead.

1354
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,040
Just kidding.

1355
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,460
Everybody get healed.

1356
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,360
Everybody get healed.

1357
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,100
Even yourself, monk.

1358
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:29,010
Vlad is really good at converting Ottomans into corn dogs.

1359
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,290
What does that mean?

1360
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,160
What does that...

1361
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,680
Is that dog trying to...

1362
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,700
Oh my God!

1363
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,620
The dog is attacking us!

1364
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,340
Anyway, sorry dog.

1365
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,580
I didn't notice.

1366
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,180
Hello!

1367
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,400
Don't look up what that means.

1368
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,160
I saw them.

1369
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,400
Like there is a crazy amount of them over there.

1370
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:16,980
Okay!

1371
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,040
I'm taking it.

1372
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:33,100
Okay!

1373
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,400
We want to fire it.

1374
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:38,420
The explosion would surely be enough to demolish that bridge.

1375
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:38,740
Okay!

1376
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,880
Take it down.

1377
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,200
Everybody else?

1378
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:45,760
Let's go!

1379
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,600
We have to take it out from far away I feel.

1380
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,160
We can't be on the bridge or else we will die with the explosion, right?

1381
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:56,800
Attack!

1382
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:58,480
Attack!

1383
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,860
Oh there is more guys over here!

1384
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,940
Hidden men!

1385
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,280
Hidden men!

1386
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,220
Attack!

1387
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:03,660
Attack!

1388
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,900
Guys be careful over here.

1389
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,160
Guys be careful.

1390
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,800
Don't get on the bridge.

1391
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,300
Get off the bridge!

1392
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:23,640
Nevermind.

1393
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:35,980
Dracula.

1394
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:39,180
Thanks!

1395
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,480
I hear wolves.

1396
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,560
I hear wolves.

1397
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:44,900
Oh!

1398
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:45,860
Who are you?

1399
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,000
Just some guy all the way up there.

1400
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:50,920
Alright.

1401
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,940
Our army is growing.

1402
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,240
And also shrinking a little bit sometimes.

1403
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,520
Where is our monk?

1404
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,480
Is he still alive?

1405
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,080
Monk?

1406
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,840
Monk?

1407
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,940
Are you in there?

1408
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,960
Is he dead?

1409
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,900
Oh no.

1410
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,340
Did he die?

1411
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:19,640
How?

1412
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,060
Oh wait.

1413
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,260
He is right here.

1414
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:21,960
Guys.

1415
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,860
False alarm.

1416
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,940
Click... Who needs healing?

1417
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,220
Can you heal yourself?

1418
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,190
He is just chilling.

1419
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,030
Alright everybody!

1420
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:38,350
Autobots!

1421
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,890
Roll out!

1422
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,250
Roll out!

1423
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:52,670
More everybody!

1424
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,790
I...

1425
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:05,430
I... I feel I... How do I get my guys to all move as a group?

1426
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:09,750
Here we go.

1427
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:13,650
We will just have the others lag behind a little bit.

1428
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:16,930
Okay.

1429
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:17,990
Taking the shortcut.

1430
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,670
Nice.

1431
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,830
Control groups, but that's hotkeys.

1432
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,910
Control 1 to create group 1.

1433
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,290
So like, let's say I do this.

1434
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:30,030
Control 1.

1435
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:32,810
Wait, how can I make it?

1436
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,110
Okay.

1437
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:34,730
Control...

1438
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,970
So group 1.

1439
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:43,410
Wait.

1440
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,950
What did I just press?

1441
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,530
Change the selected to the next number.

1442
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,890
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

1443
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:50,810
That's okay.

1444
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,710
This is group 1.

1445
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:54,770
See?

1446
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:55,690
Easy.

1447
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:57,430
Okay.

1448
01:22:58,810 --> 01:22:59,730
Going this way now.

1449
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:02,490
So...

1450
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,730
How do I make them all move though?

1451
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:09,610
Do I just like click on them?

1452
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,470
And then make them move?

1453
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,710
The catapult has friendly fire?

1454
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:19,450
No way.

1455
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,330
Now you can press 1 and 2 to select them.

1456
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,130
Oh my gosh.

1457
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:24,050
Thank you.

1458
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,750
What's this?

1459
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,750
Oh, that's where we started.

1460
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,830
They are going to ambush us.

1461
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:37,630
Which group am I pressed?

1462
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:40,490
There we go.

1463
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:40,930
Oh!

1464
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,740
Kill them!

1465
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,670
Look at these guys.

1466
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,980
Good job monk.

1467
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,080
Keep going.

1468
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,020
Our last ally.

1469
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,980
You as well.

1470
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,120
Come on team.

1471
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,540
We are the best to ever do it.

1472
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,780
lol Keep going?

1473
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,840
All the way in?

1474
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,480
You gotta step inside.

1475
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,360
Oh, thank you so much for teaching me about the groups you guys.

1476
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,360
This helps so much.

1477
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,720
I can just go 1, 2, 1, 2.

1478
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,440
Hello, it is I.

1479
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:42,680
Dracula.

1480
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,680
If you double click on a unit, it selects all units of that type.

1481
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,540
Wait, like if...

1482
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,260
No!

1483
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,540
Look how he is just casually...

1484
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:07,700
Handsomely?

1485
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:11,930
Well, ok.

1486
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:12,970
Here is the issue.

1487
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,730
Now we have more guys.

1488
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,730
So, if I do like this...

1489
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:22,290
And I press... What was it?

1490
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:22,910
Ctrl 1?

1491
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,170
Vlad is in his own thing.

1492
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:28,270
Wait, no, no, no.

1493
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,470
Then, Ctrl 2.

1494
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:32,970
I'm not quite sure.

1495
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:34,910
We are doing our best.

1496
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,350
Ok, now I can do this.

1497
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:41,950
Ctrl 1.

1498
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:44,170
Alright everybody.

1499
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:45,150
Ctrl 2.

1500
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:46,310
Attack!

1501
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,710
Ctrl 1.

1502
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:49,770
Attack!

1503
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:59,610
Now that you know how to make groups, you can separate them by type and that's the cornerstone of more advanced tactics and gameplay.

1504
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,830
Ok everybody, keep killing!

1505
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,990
Murder!

1506
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,490
Murder!

1507
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:11,110
Murder!

1508
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:11,490
Murder!

1509
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,730
Murder!

1510
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,230
Murder!

1511
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,750
We are gonna go attack this tower.

1512
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,670
These guys aren't quite sure what...

1513
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:23,590
They don't know how to cross the bridge everybody.

1514
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:26,050
They are a little... They don't know what to do.

1515
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,010
Oh no!

1516
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,170
No wait!

1517
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,490
You guys are all gonna die!

1518
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:31,850
You guys are gonna die, please.

1519
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:35,970
Vlad is...

1520
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:37,230
They are a little stupid.

1521
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,140
Kill this thing too.

1522
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,560
It's hurting us good.

1523
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,800
It's trying to run away.

1524
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,760
You little weasel.

1525
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,540
Thank you for the gold.

1526
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,400
And the men.

1527
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,080
I cannot... Wait, what did it say?

1528
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,120
The bridge has been repaired.

1529
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:30,900
Ok, cool.

1530
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,520
We can't use anything on these places.

1531
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,140
Alright.

1532
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,800
Time to make more new groups.

1533
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,680
Time to regroup!

1534
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,940
Maybe like that?

1535
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,560
And then... this?

1536
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:51,940
Ok.

1537
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,000
Roll out!

1538
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,620
Roll out!

1539
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,800
Do it.

1540
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,420
Oh wait, I think we left some.

1541
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,820
I see them on the mini-map.

1542
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,480
Wait a second, there is even more here.

1543
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,560
Unless it's talking about these.

1544
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,640
Oh yeah, it's these.

1545
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,900
Little red ones.

1546
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:17,140
Ok.

1547
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:19,680
But...

1548
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,440
I think...

1549
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,200
This guy is definitely ours.

1550
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,340
You can use the buildings.

1551
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,440
So these buildings...

1552
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,600
They don't really do much.

1553
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,840
They are just guard towers.

1554
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:34,460
Oh!

1555
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,440
I can build this stuff!

1556
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,980
Fast anti-cavalry unit.

1557
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,360
Fast cavalry for scouting and raiding.

1558
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:48,760
Hmm...

1559
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,180
We do have food and gold.

1560
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,500
Let's just build both of them.

1561
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,260
Camels OP.

1562
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,580
Oh, not enough gold.

1563
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,820
Are they slow to...

1564
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,220
We are all waiting for you guys.

1565
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:11,800
Come on!

1566
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,780
Hopefully they don't get ambushed.

1567
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:15,740
There is a dog.

1568
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,040
I like the sounds a lot.

1569
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,140
Let's make these guys...

1570
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:26,880
Everybody come over to here.

1571
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,200
There we go.

1572
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,000
So as soon as they are created, they'll...

1573
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,440
Yeah, see?

1574
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,060
They'll start going over there, you know?

1575
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,820
As soon as they are created, they'll march over.

1576
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,220
Good, good, good!

1577
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,280
Good, good, good!

1578
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,060
1v1 that dog.

1579
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:48,740
Not gonna lie.

1580
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,340
Uh-oh, I'm getting attacked.

1581
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:52,540
Just kidding.

1582
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,580
Wait, you are attacked by player 3.

1583
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:55,500
Where?

1584
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:58,720
Oh my gosh!

1585
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:00,100
Where did these guys come from?

1586
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,840
Oh wait, these are the guys that were hiding in the trees waiting to ambush us.

1587
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:06,100
Stupid.

1588
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,220
Good job team.

1589
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,620
Player 3, that rascal.

1590
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,060
He thinks he is part of the team.

1591
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:25,720
Actually, wait.

1592
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,100
No, yeah, because it's the light blue guys we are going after.

1593
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,220
Blue guys are just like...

1594
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,720
We are coming in too.

1595
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,100
Look, they are even here also.

1596
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,440
Little rascals.

1597
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:44,320
We can create more of these, so why not?

1598
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,400
We'll create one more.

1599
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,420
Yes, yes, heal him.

1600
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:52,440
Heal him.

1601
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,880
Good my monk, good!

1602
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,880
My monk heals so well.

1603
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,880
I've never played Age of Empires, but I played a lot of Rise of Nations growing up.

1604
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:02,400
Is it similar?

1605
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,120
Well guys, is it similar?

1606
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,900
Hey, come here.

1607
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:07,980
You're gonna go fight that.

1608
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,560
You go fight him.

1609
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,240
Oh damn.

1610
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,800
Stormtrooper aid.

1611
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,080
He won't be one the dog!

1612
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,680
Alright, we just have one guy coming in.

1613
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,680
Then it's time for war.

1614
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,440
D-Dog is dead.

1615
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,100
That's not D-Dog.

1616
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,660
The music is so chill.

1617
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,940
Let's make this group one.

1618
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,820
And forward.

1619
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:47,300
Okay.

1620
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,540
We'll separate them a little bit.

1621
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,220
And...

1622
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,160
Group two.

1623
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:55,920
Okay.

1624
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,640
Oh, we're getting ambushed again.

1625
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,620
You stinking guys, man.

1626
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,850
My monk is dying.

1627
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:11,390
Do you ever play Age of Mythology?

1628
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,350
I don't...

1629
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:15,650
I think I had it, but I don't remember playing it very much.

1630
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,970
I don't remember playing it very much.

1631
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:26,410
I wish if I killed stuff, I could get food.

1632
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:30,730
I'm just taking a pathway.

1633
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:32,170
Hopefully I'm going the right way.

1634
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,050
Oh wait, this is the edge of the map.

1635
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:36,470
Everybody reroute!

1636
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:40,450
I didn't realize this is the edge of the map.

1637
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,430
Reroute!

1638
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:41,990
Reroute!

1639
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:45,890
Oops!

1640
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:53,270
Come on!

1641
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:58,450
I feel like I did play it though.

1642
01:32:58,450 --> 01:32:59,630
Uh-oh.

1643
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:00,710
Uh-oh.

1644
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,910
Oh god, watch out for friendly fire!

1645
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:10,650
Kill that dog.

1646
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,650
Kill the dog.

1647
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,030
Okay.

1648
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:19,010
The earth is flat.

1649
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,590
The map is... No, it's...

1650
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,690
Just got invisible walls.

1651
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:28,430
Keep going, keep going.

1652
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:30,550
These dang blue guys though.

1653
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:31,890
Oh my gosh, we're so close.

1654
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:33,670
Everybody...

1655
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,810
We're so close to...

1656
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:38,050
To battle.

1657
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:40,930
Secret!

1658
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:41,970
Hidden guys!

1659
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:43,310
Oh my gosh.

1660
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:44,850
How?

1661
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:45,610
Why?

1662
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:46,650
Why are you out here?

1663
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,730
They say we belong to no man, no group.

1664
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,450
Attack!

1665
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:03,430
Attack!

1666
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:03,790
Attack!

1667
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,590
Actually, attack, attack.

1668
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,710
And you guys attack.

1669
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,290
And you guys also attack.

1670
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:12,110
Friendly forest spirits.

1671
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,610
I don't know about that.

1672
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,870
What am I...

1673
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:18,150
Oh, we're destroying the camp.

1674
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:18,430
Okay.

1675
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:21,710
Attack?

1676
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:23,290
Like get in there?

1677
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,890
Start beating stuff up?

1678
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,420
Destroy!

1679
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,320
Destroy!

1680
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,320
Destroy!

1681
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,220
It's definitely killing our own soldiers.

1682
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,340
We'll have him destroy this thing instead.

1683
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,340
You know...

1684
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,540
Destroy!

1685
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:11,960
You want him alive!

1686
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,660
Huh?

1687
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,540
Uh-oh.

1688
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,580
I don't think I have enough guys.

1689
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,300
Oh, okay.

1690
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,880
Yes!

1691
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:40,610
I did it.

1692
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:42,990
I am victorious.

1693
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:52,390
I won a game.

1694
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,030
Playing as the Turks.

1695
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,990
The campaigns are fun.

1696
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:27,030
I never did them.

1697
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,350
I only did the create your own area.

1698
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,430
Okay, look at Castlevania.

1699
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,430
No peace?

1700
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:01,890
Not on my watch.

1701
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:04,890
Oh yeah.

1702
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:06,290
Oh yeah.

1703
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:07,210
We're the winners.

1704
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,470
Oh, Hungary.

1705
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:16,090
Oh, no society.

1706
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:17,810
We had no society either.

1707
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:19,990
We had one economy.

1708
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:23,190
Can I have one economy please?

1709
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:24,910
One single economy.

1710
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:30,470
We did not live in a society.

1711
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:31,750
Zero society.

1712
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:34,770
Only the Wallachian.

1713
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:36,610
Is that how you said it again?

1714
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:37,290
I don't remember.

1715
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:38,850
Okay.

1716
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:41,490
This was fun.

1717
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:45,990
But like I said, I do kind of want to just do...

1718
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:49,570
Like the single player... It's not the campaigns.

1719
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:52,130
Is it just a skirmish?

1720
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:56,850
Like this is one where we just kind of build our own society and...

1721
01:37:58,110 --> 01:37:59,210
It is the skirmish.

1722
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,370
Skirmish.

1723
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,590
It's a random map.

1724
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:04,210
How many AIs should we have?

1725
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:06,230
Oh.

1726
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:07,470
Whoa.

1727
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:11,190
I kind of want it to all be random though.

1728
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,850
It might be fine.

1729
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,770
All of them.

1730
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:18,490
Okay.

1731
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,870
Wait.

1732
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,830
It's only... Oh.

1733
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:28,170
Oh.

1734
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,150
Sorry guys.

1735
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,670
I'm an idiot.

1736
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:30,910
There we go.

1737
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:37,640
Select your team number.

1738
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,660
Players on the same team automatically have their diplomatic stance.

1739
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:43,420
Set to ally and allied victory set.

1740
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:47,960
Okay.

1741
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,440
Hold on.

1742
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,900
Let's switch this up a little bit.

1743
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,660
Let's have like CD...

1744
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:54,980
Oh wait.

1745
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:58,500
HD.

1746
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:01,840
HD.

1747
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:02,920
AI.

1748
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,780
We'll give it a little bit of a spicy flavor.

1749
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,280
Change the map size.

1750
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:09,560
Oh.

1751
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:10,460
It's so tiny.

1752
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,060
Let's do Ludacris.

1753
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:17,040
Don't forget to train an ice monkey.

1754
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,220
A single ice monkey.

1755
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:24,060
I'm gonna do like 300 population.

1756
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,500
I don't know anything.

1757
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,540
Allow cheats.

1758
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:28,340
Wait.

1759
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:28,600
Hold on.

1760
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,080
Let me get my head out of the way for a second.

1761
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,520
Random map.

1762
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,280
Sudden death.

1763
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,060
Players are eliminated when they have no town centers left.

1764
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:39,940
Oh no.

1765
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,320
Scary.

1766
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,800
Let's just do a random map.

1767
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,740
It could be that one.

1768
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,440
Who knows?

1769
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:46,940
Location.

1770
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,240
Random.

1771
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:56,030
I'm closing my eyes.

1772
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:02,090
Hold on.

1773
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:02,950
I'll do it again.

1774
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:07,330
Kawasa... Oh.

1775
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:09,850
Kilimanjaro?

1776
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:16,030
How do you turn this off?

1777
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:17,210
What are you talking about?

1778
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:21,950
Wait.

1779
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,610
That would be so cool though.

1780
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,690
We can climb the mountain.

1781
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:24,830
Hmm.

1782
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:35,230
Can't wait for you to use this cheat.

1783
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:35,950
Who's your daddy?

1784
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:36,270
Wait.

1785
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:36,770
Wrong game.

1786
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:39,910
I don't know that one.

1787
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,450
Mountain Ridge.

1788
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:45,650
You know what?

1789
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,330
That seems pretty fair, right?

1790
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:49,370
Mountain Ridge maybe?

1791
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:49,990
I don't know.

1792
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:51,330
I don't know anything.

1793
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:53,110
Everything is standard.

1794
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:56,830
Shared exploration.

1795
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,110
No, no, no.

1796
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,870
Thanks for the super chat!

1797
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:02,830
It's from Warcraft 3.

1798
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,190
What's the turbo mode?

1799
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:08,490
No, I don't want everything to be built faster.

1800
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:13,610
Antiquity mode.

1801
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,550
Oysters and wood trading.

1802
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:19,330
Record game.

1803
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,670
Oh, a record game.

1804
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:25,070
English is so stupid!

1805
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,610
It can be record or record.

1806
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,440
That's why we defeated the English.

1807
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:43,100
So true!

1808
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,100
Regicide.

1809
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,760
This will cause players to spawn a king with additional villagers.

1810
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,100
If you lose your king, you are... No, no, no.

1811
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,380
Let's just do normal.

1812
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:56,960
Okay.

1813
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,460
I'm scared.

1814
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,220
AI to easy?

1815
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,920
No, I think standard is fine.

1816
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:05,520
Right?

1817
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,580
If I die...

1818
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,080
Put me in the history books.

1819
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:15,340
Say that I was the best who ever did it.

1820
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:19,020
If I die... Is this fine?

1821
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,340
Do I need to put teams or do I need to like...

1822
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,860
Can I have like two teams on my side?

1823
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,420
I kind of want some people.

1824
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,300
I want like two people on my side.

1825
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:31,940
You know what I mean?

1826
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:37,260
Oh, sorry.

1827
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,160
Like if I put... Okay, here we go.

1828
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,220
Players on the same team automatically have diplomatic stance.

1829
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,180
A dash indicates no team.

1830
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:47,420
Question mark indicates...

1831
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,260
So I could be... Okay, so if I'm like one, that's our team.

1832
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,980
And then one is our team.

1833
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,160
And then this...

1834
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,000
would be random.

1835
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,820
They could betray us.

1836
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:05,560
Oh, sorry.

1837
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,560
I'm gonna do two for sure and then everyone else...

1838
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:13,320
They could be on our side.

1839
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,060
Could not.

1840
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:15,940
We don't know.

1841
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,020
EZ and I waits for you to advance ages.

1842
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:22,540
Oh really?

1843
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,220
Maybe we should do an EZ.

1844
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,480
It's my first game.

1845
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,200
Let's do EZ.

1846
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,990
18 rabbit.

1847
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:35,970
What?

1848
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:37,970
Team one, team two.

1849
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:38,070
Oh.

1850
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:46,910
Hold on, I'm moving back over a little bit.

1851
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:53,800
What's that?

1852
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,160
This is our scout.

1853
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,320
Holy cow.

1854
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,760
Wait, our friends down here aren't so far it seems.

1855
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,120
I think we can get to them.

1856
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,160
Oh, there's one more guy.

1857
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:30,300
Turn on auto... Oh, we have gold here!

1858
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,920
Big, big, big.

1859
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,060
Let's look around the area.

1860
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,840
How do I turn on auto scout?

1861
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,240
Attack mode.

1862
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,140
Defense aggressive.

1863
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:41,760
Patrol.

1864
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,500
Click the area.

1865
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,710
Lower... Lower what?

1866
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:54,890
The compass, the last symbol.

1867
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,370
Oh, this one!

1868
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,870
Okay, bye scout!

1869
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,850
Turn on auto scout in any game mode.

1870
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:09,790
Oh, we got some... guys here.

1871
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:10,670
Alright, you mister.

1872
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:11,910
You come here.

1873
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:15,130
Yeah, you're gonna start doing that.

1874
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:18,770
We got more gold!

1875
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,390
Big, big, big, big.

1876
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:22,410
This game has auto scout.

1877
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:27,950
I love when people learn things when I play game.

1878
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:30,270
Because I learn and then you can learn.

1879
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:32,670
I love that.

1880
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:33,890
So fun.

1881
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,950
Okay, we can make one more person.

1882
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,570
He'll be our little builder.

1883
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,350
He'll be our little builder for now.

1884
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:46,110
I don't learn.

1885
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:46,890
Yeah, I know.

1886
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:47,690
Some of you don't.

1887
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,610
Some of you will never learn.

1888
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:53,650
You'll learn!

1889
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:56,250
Look at this.

1890
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,850
This guy is the worst scout ever.

1891
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:00,970
Alright, lady.

1892
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:04,230
Start making a little village for us.

1893
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:08,410
Mountain.

1894
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:12,750
Goodbye, scout!

1895
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:14,130
We have stone!

1896
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:15,970
We got stone.

1897
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:17,170
Good, good, good.

1898
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:18,390
Goodness.

1899
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:19,970
What's that?

1900
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:20,850
That's a pig!

1901
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,390
Oh, pig's found!

1902
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:24,530
Head on home, pig.

1903
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:26,230
Head on home.

1904
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,130
No, no, no, no, no.

1905
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:29,050
Auto scout.

1906
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:30,530
More stone.

1907
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:33,570
Awesome.

1908
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:34,430
Hi.

1909
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:35,110
Hi.

1910
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,610
Little lady, you're gonna build us a barracks.

1911
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,210
You know what?

1912
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:40,370
Let's just get into it.

1913
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,630
Barracks goes...

1914
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,510
Over here.

1915
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,230
Nice.

1916
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,270
She's backseating the scout.

1917
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:56,950
Where is he?

1918
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,870
He's just not optimizing his scouting, you know?

1919
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:04,450
Oh my god!

1920
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:06,150
A relic!

1921
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:07,670
No way!

1922
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:09,310
There's just one right next to us!

1923
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:10,370
Oh my god!

1924
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:12,910
It's just on the ground right there!

1925
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:16,470
How much backseating should we do?

1926
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:19,770
I'll ask for help, you know?

1927
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:21,670
Get it.

1928
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:22,850
We gotta get a monk.

1929
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:23,930
We gotta get a monk.

1930
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:26,470
Nice.

1931
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:31,790
Let's get a mining camp like right here.

1932
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:34,030
In the middle of them.

1933
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:37,250
And then we'll get this guy to go over here.

1934
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:41,190
And he'll start doing that... working on that one instead.

1935
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,410
A Vietnamese faction.

1936
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:49,790
Can't wait to destroy you.

1937
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:50,130
Stop!

1938
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:52,030
Aren't we friends?

1939
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:53,750
I think.

1940
01:47:56,890 --> 01:47:59,570
We're in the dark ages, but we won't be forever.

1941
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,500
Let's get some more guys.

1942
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,840
Let's get like... two more guys.

1943
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,540
Oh, and now she's a gold miner.

1944
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:13,020
No, ma'am!

1945
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,400
We need more wood, actually.

1946
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,620
So we need you to start...

1947
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,380
Start doing that instead.

1948
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,500
When is the Paradox or Total War rabbit hole starting?

1949
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,560
One day at a time, everybody.

1950
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:33,580
One day at a time.

1951
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:35,700
Look at him go.

1952
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,320
Look at him go.

1953
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:37,980
Wait, what's this?

1954
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,840
There's two of them?

1955
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,440
I don't even actually know what these are for.

1956
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,660
I just remember doing it in the tutorial.

1957
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:53,640
I don't actually quite know what it's for, even.

1958
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,240
I wanna get a lumber camp.

1959
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:58,780
And then we can put it over here.

1960
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,540
They give gold over time.

1961
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,020
Okay.

1962
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,360
You... also do some more wood.

1963
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:15,820
And you... also... wood.

1964
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,540
We don't really have much else that I can do, so...

1965
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,360
Relics generate infinite gold.

1966
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:25,020
That's huge.

1967
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,100
We gotta get it before anybody else finds it.

1968
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:32,240
We need the gold more than anybody else.

1969
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,980
Our society is the most important.

1970
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,380
Let's go scout.

1971
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:44,580
There he goes.

1972
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,440
Yeah, cover that land.

1973
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:50,640
Yeah, cover that land.

1974
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,680
That's not a friend.

1975
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,600
That's not a friend.

1976
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:12,510
Neutral scout.

1977
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,150
Who's

1978
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:22,900
that?

1979
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:23,720
Oh, militia.

1980
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:24,380
Yeah, yeah.

1981
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:25,960
We're creating our army.

1982
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,300
A little bit.

1983
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,880
I wonder if they're close.

1984
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,300
Let's see if he's still over there.

1985
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,320
I'll just give him a little greeting.

1986
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,000
Like, hey, buddy.

1987
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:48,060
How's it going, huh?

1988
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:49,640
Yeah?

1989
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,140
You go too.

1990
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,400
Yeah, yeah.

1991
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,500
Hey, buddy.

1992
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,160
How's it going?

1993
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:58,980
How's it hanging?

1994
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:01,200
Okay, we're getting lots of...

1995
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,760
We're getting lots of wood now.

1996
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:10,160
Can you build...this?

1997
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,100
And you...build...a mill?

1998
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:18,340
Like...

1999
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:22,480
Like here?

2000
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,280
Yeah.

2001
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,840
Okay.

2002
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,480
I'm against AI right now.

2003
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:34,140
I wonder if for this game...

2004
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:36,820
Say I wanted to play with you guys.

2005
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:42,140
Is that possible or is it kind of a...you have to...

2006
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:48,140
You have to...

2007
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,960
Is it like I can create like a private lobby sort of deal or...

2008
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,140
Online play is possible.

2009
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:55,900
It is?

2010
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,240
Oh my gosh.

2011
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,300
If you guys want to play with me, you guys would probably destroy my kingdom.

2012
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:03,440
You guys would all gang up on me and destroy my kingdom, but...

2013
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,600
I think it'd still be fun.

2014
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:08,480
Yeah?

2015
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:15,620
You would play?

2016
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,600
I think that guy is long gone.

2017
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:20,000
I was hoping this would be more...

2018
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:21,300
More...ocean.

2019
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,580
We can play with Tinas?

2020
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,340
Would you guys want to do that?

2021
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,320
Oh my gosh.

2022
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,180
That would be so fun.

2023
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,120
I was just thinking today.

2024
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:34,320
I was like I wish...

2025
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,180
That I had a game that I could play with you guys.

2026
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,000
That would be so fun.

2027
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,660
You could play a co-op game with chat versus AI.

2028
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,120
Could we?

2029
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:45,780
Oh my gosh.

2030
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:51,240
Also, if you have Game Pass, this game is free on Game Pass.

2031
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,780
But I already had it on Steam, so...

2032
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:01,780
I'm watching this while I research for a paper for my ancient Roman society for culture class.

2033
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:05,900
So, should I also cite this for my paper?

2034
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,800
We're not Roman, but...

2035
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,880
I think it could work.

2036
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:12,420
Skip ad.

2037
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:12,860
What?

2038
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,740
It's not even an ad.

2039
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,260
I'm telling you.

2040
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,060
If you have it, you can get it for free.

2041
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,680
I'm trying to help your wallet.

2042
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:24,250
We live in a Roman society.

2043
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:25,850
Actually, we're Bengalis.

2044
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:30,950
Bengalis?

2045
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:31,990
Bengalis?

2046
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:34,290
Actually, I don't know which one it is actually.

2047
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:36,370
Bengali.

2048
01:53:36,370 --> 01:53:37,370
Oh!

2049
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:43,270
There's one even closer.

2050
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:46,850
We're gonna have so much money.

2051
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:49,310
Okay, we gotta get a monkey stat.

2052
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:51,170
Bengalis.

2053
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:51,590
Okay.

2054
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,450
Bengali is nuts.

2055
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:57,610
Oh my

2056
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:01,650
gosh, yeah.

2057
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:02,910
Eleven would work.

2058
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:05,710
If we had multiplayer, right?

2059
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:06,990
That would be so great.

2060
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:11,170
Everybody's so busy working.

2061
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:13,730
Look at them go.

2062
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:15,130
Look at my little guys.

2063
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:19,390
Let's create... oh wait, I need...

2064
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:24,230
We need someone to build a house.

2065
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:27,410
This is our little neighborhood.

2066
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:30,130
Try it here?

2067
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:35,630
I don't even know what's supposed to happen.

2068
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:35,650
What's going on?

2069
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,010
Are you supposed to laugh?

2070
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:47,170
Do all the little characters go like...

2071
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:49,070
Do they do that?

2072
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,410
That would be so cute.

2073
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:55,630
I was gonna build some outposts.

2074
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,110
Just a few.

2075
01:54:57,670 --> 01:54:58,770
Like one over here.

2076
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:01,430
You know, so we can see.

2077
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:03,950
I'm also gonna build some people.

2078
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:05,790
Gonna create life.

2079
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:08,510
It's a setting, maybe.

2080
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:13,290
Hey!

2081
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:15,850
Go do this one.

2082
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:16,690
It's closer, buddy.

2083
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:20,350
We're gonna...

2084
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:23,430
Maybe after the piggies, we have...

2085
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:28,370
We have her build a farm as well.

2086
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:33,350
The outpost has been built.

2087
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:37,650
Let's see.

2088
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:39,110
What do we want?

2089
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,750
Actually, let's have you be a farmer.

2090
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:44,170
You're a farmer now.

2091
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:48,370
And you...

2092
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:51,820
What else do we need?

2093
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,960
Get out of the dark ages.

2094
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,040
We need to go to the feudal age.

2095
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,420
We need more food.

2096
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:02,800
Alright, Mr. Farmer.

2097
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:07,120
We need food, food, food.

2098
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,200
A tournament.

2099
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:10,660
This one's so scary.

2100
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,760
Might be fun though.

2101
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,700
Might be fun.

2102
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,060
And scary.

2103
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:21,960
I don't think I would feel very confident.

2104
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,040
The feudal age.

2105
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:29,060
So true.

2106
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,740
We're gonna get money in no time though.

2107
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,420
I mean, food.

2108
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,260
We'll get it.

2109
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:43,890
Let's just have him finish this tree.

2110
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:44,670
It's almost done.

2111
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:49,420
And this lady is cooking.

2112
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,680
I'm gonna create...

2113
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:58,070
A few more, Militia.

2114
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,870
O3 food, please.

2115
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:05,770
Is that a command?

2116
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:07,650
Wait, where's our scout?

2117
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:10,210
Where is he?

2118
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:11,110
Oh, there he is.

2119
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:13,630
He loves this corner.

2120
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:19,450
He is having the time of his life in this corner.

2121
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,670
Try using slash 11 instead.

2122
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:26,110
I did turn that on!

2123
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:27,650
I do remember turning...

2124
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:39,420
Wait, do they all laugh if I go close to home?

2125
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:45,940
Let's slash 30.

2126
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:09,560
Wait, can I make...If I made that a dono sound, would you guys...

2127
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:15,680
I love that.

2128
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:21,660
I get it.

2129
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:22,600
I understand now.

2130
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,460
I don't wanna...I wish I had another scout.

2131
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,340
Let's create two more people.

2132
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,140
Let's max out.

2133
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:43,240
We're getting wood.

2134
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:44,060
We're getting food.

2135
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,000
We could get more food.

2136
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,260
Try slash 8.

2137
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,160
I think I remember that one.

2138
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:08,510
I got you...

2139
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:17,220
Hold on, I gotta take my...I gotta take my cough medicine!

2140
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:19,020
What the hell!

2141
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,620
King of the losers!

2142
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,660
I hate you!

2143
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,100
I hate you!

2144
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:36,670
What?

2145
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:37,870
What does that mean?

2146
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:40,590
I want you to get food.

2147
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,090
Question.

2148
01:59:42,810 --> 01:59:46,470
Does getting food from animals yield more...

2149
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:51,690
Supply...like more food than getting from like a...

2150
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:52,870
Like a farm?

2151
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,550
Or does it not really matter?

2152
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:59,290
And it's faster?

2153
01:59:59,530 --> 01:59:59,750
Okay.

2154
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:02,850
So let's build a...

2155
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,970
I wonder if I build a mill over here.

2156
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:09,770
Will these guys run away?

2157
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:15,310
The lambs...or the piggies and the lambs just stay for the slaughter.

2158
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:19,010
But...

2159
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,920
They won't?

2160
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:22,620
They won't run?

2161
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:28,860
Here, I'm gonna try killing this guy.

2162
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,520
Alright.

2163
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:39,240
Alright, we are building our little civilization.

2164
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:40,340
Slowly but surely.

2165
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:43,560
We can...we can go to the feudal age.

2166
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,100
You can see all the taunts in the trumpet.

2167
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,040
Oh please.

2168
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:55,660
Don't point that...my granny?

2169
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,880
Long time, no siege.

2170
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:01,860
Monk!

2171
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,140
I need a monk!

2172
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,780
What age are you in?

2173
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,140
ASL

2174
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:31,700
Oh!

2175
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,880
Oh my god, they are answering!

2176
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,500
They are in the dark age!

2177
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,560
Oh my god, they are answering my question!

2178
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:39,180
My friends!

2179
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:43,240
Guys, there is five relics around us.

2180
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,020
As soon as we get a monk, he is going on a great journey.

2181
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:49,020
They are still in the dark age.

2182
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:51,040
It's okay, I'm almost in the feudal age.

2183
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:56,420
I'm almost in the feudal age.

2184
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:01,180
Let's see.

2185
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,300
I'm gonna grab...

2186
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:13,140
We are gonna grab someone who will give us...build us another house.

2187
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:16,820
Why did I build a barrack so close to the housing?

2188
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,040
Oh my gosh, I'm so bad at this.

2189
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:23,760
I just spent too much money on the plushie and magnets.

2190
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,020
Oh no, I'm sorry!

2191
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:28,420
Can't wait for them to arrive and love the streams.

2192
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,460
Thank you!

2193
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:31,500
Thank you for ordering them.

2194
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,760
I really appreciate it.

2195
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,040
Easy AI is pretty chill.

2196
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,480
Okay.

2197
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,940
I do like just the building aspect of everything too.

2198
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:43,180
I love exploration stuff.

2199
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:47,760
It's one thing that I wish, you know, like with Minecraft...

2200
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,600
I love Minecraft, obviously.

2201
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,500
I'm in the feudal age!

2202
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:59,300
I love Minecraft, obviously, but I wish there was more, like, stuff with, like, exploration.

2203
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:03,600
I wish there was more way to find, like...

2204
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:05,060
How do you say?

2205
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,680
I wish that...

2206
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,000
I wish that...

2207
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,600
You could...

2208
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:19,700
Have more structures to find and stuff.

2209
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:23,900
I know, obviously, there's mods, but...

2210
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:24,620
You know what I mean?

2211
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,660
That's my complaint.

2212
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,520
I missed Arteus.

2213
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,880
There used to be a lot of them.

2214
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:36,380
Oh yeah!

2215
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:40,140
As soon as monks are ready, they'll be on a spiritual journey.

2216
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:40,860
Yeah.

2217
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:45,600
Yeah, we're gonna be reaping in all the cash money, baby.

2218
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,660
It'll be crazy.

2219
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:54,100
In fact, let's get our guys to work more efficiently.

2220
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:55,940
Let's research that.

2221
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,140
And research...

2222
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:01,520
This.

2223
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,720
And now we can upgrade our men.

2224
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:09,740
It costs a lot of food, but it might be worth.

2225
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:12,380
Yes, you.

2226
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:13,940
Build...

2227
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:14,960
Oh my god!

2228
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:18,060
Attack that guy!

2229
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,780
Attack the Eagle Scout!

2230
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:24,500
Hey, can you build a watchtower?

2231
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:28,600
That guy came out of nowhere.

2232
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:30,540
He's so fast.

2233
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:31,280
Holy moly.

2234
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:36,320
Our guys are like, literally not even worried.

2235
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:38,040
Taking their sweet ass time.

2236
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:40,780
OK, give up on him!

2237
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:41,640
Give up on him!

2238
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,220
Go back home!

2239
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:50,070
You win today, little scout.

2240
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:51,030
You win today.

2241
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:53,270
OK, we need...

2242
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:56,770
We need more to get the monastery.

2243
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:58,290
Wait, what do I need?

2244
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:03,090
Do I need to get into the castle age?

2245
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:06,110
Oh, this is our friend!

2246
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,730
This is our friend, everybody!

2247
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:08,670
Say hi!

2248
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:11,450
Say hi to Scout!

2249
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:13,810
Hello, this is our friend.

2250
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:17,010
Been hosting a Minecraft server for a while.

2251
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:22,350
1.2, 1.4 is a bit of a pain, but a plugin I came across is better structures.

2252
02:05:22,970 --> 02:05:23,450
Really?

2253
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:26,530
Yeah, that is exactly what I want.

2254
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:31,330
We need stone, and like, bad.

2255
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:33,390
So let's...

2256
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:37,190
Hold on, there is stone down there, but I thought I saw stone elsewhere.

2257
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:38,650
Maybe not.

2258
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,490
Hello Scout, welcome home!

2259
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:51,140
They have advanced to the feudal age!

2260
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:52,980
They are a little slow, but...

2261
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:55,720
OK, let's have a build a... not blacksmith.

2262
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:57,880
I mean, yes, eventually.

2263
02:05:59,020 --> 02:05:59,980
Have to build that.

2264
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:06,900
It's kind of sobering to think that this game is older than most of your viewers.

2265
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:09,500
He's back!

2266
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,000
Go home.

2267
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:14,620
Go home, Eagle Scout.

2268
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:16,880
I

2269
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,600
don't know how to feel about that.

2270
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:27,120
I don't know how to feel about that.

2271
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:48,250
It's only 25 years old.

2272
02:06:49,410 --> 02:06:51,170
It can have... Oh my gosh.

2273
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:56,050
This game has babies, probably.

2274
02:06:57,730 --> 02:06:58,270
Babies...

2275
02:06:58,270 --> 02:07:02,890
That's when, like, people have... Oh my gosh, this game would be married, probably.

2276
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:04,990
It's like when people get married.

2277
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:07,590
This game will...

2278
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:07,750
No.

2279
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,250
OK,

2280
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:17,850
we got some stone going on.

2281
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:19,430
We got our stone network.

2282
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:23,530
What do we need for... We need more...

2283
02:07:23,530 --> 02:07:24,990
OK, two feudal age buildings.

2284
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:26,730
Oh, actually, that'd be great.

2285
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:27,790
We can get a blacksmith.

2286
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,590
We'll get one right here.

2287
02:07:30,550 --> 02:07:32,510
And we'll have you build...

2288
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:33,670
a market.

2289
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:39,970
I'm older than the game.

2290
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:40,930
I don't even have a wife.

2291
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:43,070
Well, I said...

2292
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:44,590
I said...

2293
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:47,270
I said mo...

2294
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:48,430
I mean, not all.

2295
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:51,930
You know, don't feel any pressure...

2296
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:52,630
to...

2297
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:55,790
to compare yourself to... I mean, it's Age of Empires, like...

2298
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:59,590
Anybody would marry Age of Empires 2, like...

2299
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:01,630
Don't...

2300
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,610
You know...

2301
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:05,330
You're going at your own minto pace.

2302
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:11,160
Slash 8?

2303
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:11,920
What's that one?

2304
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:32,300
No, I'm... It's not...

2305
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:36,960
It's not what you think.

2306
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,960
It's not what you think.

2307
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:47,160
What's Slash 11?

2308
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,060
Oh, stop!

2309
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,000
I'm new to the game.

2310
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:54,280
I don't remember what the controls are.

2311
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,720
I don't remember.

2312
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,680
King of the Loser.

2313
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:04,540
Stop.

2314
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,300
Stop it.

2315
02:09:09,020 --> 02:09:10,760
Oh my gosh.

2316
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,720
I don't mean it.

2317
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,120
I don't mean it.

2318
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:25,180
Even if you're King of the Loser, you're our loser, OK?

2319
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:28,100
Right, everyone?

2320
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,720
Where's our scout?

2321
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,140
Look, he's all the way here.

2322
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:44,120
We found that relic.

2323
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,340
What's this?

2324
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:49,360
Oh, enemy territory.

2325
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:50,960
Wait!

2326
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:55,180
Wait, I didn't turn on Share Scouts.

2327
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,160
Why am I suddenly seeing everything on the minimap?

2328
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:02,000
Why am I suddenly seeing everything?

2329
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,760
It's the Lunar New Year.

2330
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,180
Guess what year it is.

2331
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:05,940
It's the year of the snake.

2332
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:06,420
I know!

2333
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:07,820
Happy New Year!

2334
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:09,360
Thanks for the superchat!

2335
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,460
Oh, the market does that.

2336
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:14,360
I see, I see.

2337
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,840
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

2338
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:18,300
Interesting.

2339
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:18,720
OK.

2340
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:21,460
We're gonna have you be a little farmer.

2341
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:24,960
Yeah, a little farmer lady.

2342
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,140
And we have two people who are bored.

2343
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,380
What do we need more of?

2344
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:32,200
We need more wood.

2345
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:34,240
Oh, we desperately need more wood.

2346
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:41,300
Hey, why don't you become a lumberjack?

2347
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:44,740
Awesome.

2348
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:46,660
What else can we upgrade?

2349
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:56,620
Alright, once we get to 800 food we'll be able to advance and then we can build a monastery and then we can get gold, gold, gold, gold, gold.

2350
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:58,700
I do have cheats enabled.

2351
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:04,100
I do want to play, since this is like my first real game.

2352
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,580
I want to play as much as I can normal.

2353
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:10,680
Before I...

2354
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,340
You start using cheats.

2355
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,320
So yeah.

2356
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,910
13 months of mint, yay!

2357
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:27,790
Thank you!

2358
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:29,870
13 months, oh my gosh.

2359
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:32,370
Thank you, sleep monster, thank you!

2360
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:36,090
What's up, K.R.Z., welcome back, thank you.

2361
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:38,630
Let's go, alright.

2362
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:40,470
700, we're so close.

2363
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:41,950
770.

2364
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:44,590
Do you allow chat to give hints?

2365
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,290
What do you consider that backseat?

2366
02:11:48,370 --> 02:11:48,970
Why?

2367
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:49,010
Why?

2368
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:51,470
What hint do you want to give?

2369
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:55,330
Go ahead, guys, you can give some hints.

2370
02:11:55,850 --> 02:12:01,490
Like I said, I've never played this before, so if you want to give hints right now, this is your chance.

2371
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:03,910
This is your chance to give hints.

2372
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:04,570
Okay, let's upgrade.

2373
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:06,670
Don't die.

2374
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,370
Right click to attack, okay.

2375
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:11,690
Villagers cost 50 food.

2376
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:14,230
Yep, I can read that part.

2377
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:15,730
No help.

2378
02:12:16,110 --> 02:12:18,210
Okay, get stone for walls.

2379
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:19,890
Well, we are getting stone.

2380
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:23,710
This guy...

2381
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:26,310
You know what, he can start becoming a stone man.

2382
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:29,570
I was going to say a stoner, but that's totally different.

2383
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:38,650
Is it worth the extra $10 a month for rising...

2384
02:12:38,650 --> 02:12:39,210
Oh gosh.

2385
02:12:42,230 --> 02:12:43,590
$10 a month?

2386
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:54,810
Upgrading your lumber camps and mining camps...

2387
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:55,870
You can upgrade these?

2388
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:57,170
Oh my gosh, you can!

2389
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:59,810
I didn't even realize that.

2390
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:00,910
Thank you.

2391
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:05,290
Question, if I upgrade this one, does it also affect...

2392
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:06,470
Does it affect all of them?

2393
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:08,050
Oh, it seems it does.

2394
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:08,430
Maybe?

2395
02:13:10,450 --> 02:13:12,090
It says upgrade it, yes.

2396
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:20,370
Alright, I know these are costing us a pretty penny.

2397
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:24,350
But I think they'll be good in the long run, you know.

2398
02:13:26,130 --> 02:13:28,050
We're also almost to the castle age.

2399
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:30,390
Nice!

2400
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,430
It's research.

2401
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,670
That's so fancy.

2402
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:37,810
Double bit... I didn't realize I could upgrade these.

2403
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:38,470
See?

2404
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:39,330
Thank you.

2405
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:40,530
You helped out.

2406
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:41,830
You helped big.

2407
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:44,550
Kiwawa!

2408
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:46,610
I have an AO2 itch.

2409
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:48,210
But it gets so...

2410
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:51,690
It always gets so intimidating by the end game.

2411
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:53,150
It gets so difficult and stressful to me.

2412
02:13:53,530 --> 02:13:54,370
Hi Kiwawa!

2413
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:58,370
Kiwawa, would you ever wanna do multiplayer?

2414
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:00,910
With this game?

2415
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:03,010
Do you wanna multiplayer?

2416
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:05,310
Would you wanna build a civilization with me?

2417
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:09,270
And would you wanna take down other civilizations with me?

2418
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:11,010
Would you wanna do that?

2419
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:15,510
Our little army is just chilling.

2420
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:20,070
Oh, we have some guys.

2421
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:20,930
Let's see.

2422
02:14:22,970 --> 02:14:23,330
You...

2423
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:27,630
Kill that thing.

2424
02:14:29,330 --> 02:14:30,050
You...

2425
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:31,910
Become a lumberjack.

2426
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,800
Our first casualty and it's against a pig.

2427
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,160
Uh...

2428
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:51,940
That's awkward.

2429
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:57,360
Look at him dissolve into the ground.

2430
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:00,020
I'm sorry little man!

2431
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:03,600
I didn't realize a pig would kill you.

2432
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:14,810
I know the wolves fight.

2433
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:16,810
I did not realize the pigs fought too.

2434
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:18,930
Heavy plow.

2435
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:21,870
Plus one food.

2436
02:15:22,590 --> 02:15:24,010
Alright, we're investing.

2437
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:29,050
We need a guy.

2438
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:33,950
We just lost one, so we can build a new guy.

2439
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:40,790
And we can...

2440
02:15:42,710 --> 02:15:44,790
We can then...

2441
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:47,550
Build our monastery.

2442
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:50,450
Alright lady.

2443
02:15:50,990 --> 02:15:51,350
Hi.

2444
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:53,770
We don't have enough wood.

2445
02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:55,770
Okay, keep on chopping.

2446
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:58,330
A university?

2447
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,510
Oh my gosh, I never got that far.

2448
02:16:02,230 --> 02:16:02,830
Alright.

2449
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,630
Wow, this one is so pretty.

2450
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:05,310
Oh my gosh.

2451
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:07,630
Let's build it.

2452
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:12,730
Like right here.

2453
02:16:14,170 --> 02:16:17,470
Welcome to Nelo... Sorry, Nelo Wafers.

2454
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:19,730
Welcome... What do you mean not enough wood?

2455
02:16:20,410 --> 02:16:21,050
For what?

2456
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:23,350
Thank you.

2457
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:30,070
Alright, once we build this and get our monk and get our relics...

2458
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:31,110
Like there is one right there.

2459
02:16:32,070 --> 02:16:34,890
We can stop mining the gold maybe.

2460
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:36,530
I think it will be enough.

2461
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,020
Gosh, I need a lot more wood.

2462
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:45,300
My hand feels heavy.

2463
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:46,240
Will you hold it?

2464
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:55,280
Never is enough.

2465
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:56,320
No, keep building.

2466
02:16:57,060 --> 02:16:58,540
Hey lady.

2467
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:04,700
Okay monk.

2468
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:10,460
I need you to walk faster.

2469
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:13,240
This one costs money to make you...

2470
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:16,000
Montezuma has advanced to the castle age.

2471
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:18,660
That's not good.

2472
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:22,080
Where is our scout?

2473
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:24,180
Is that him?

2474
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:26,960
Look, they are traveling together.

2475
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:28,500
So cute.

2476
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,820
More places are advancing.

2477
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,740
But we are the first.

2478
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:37,980
Hey, who are you?

2479
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:39,680
Oh my ally.

2480
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:40,560
Okay, nevermind.

2481
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:45,570
What did you just take?

2482
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:47,870
What are we trading?

2483
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:49,930
What are we trading?

2484
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:52,130
Tributes!

2485
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,360
Gold accumulates faster.

2486
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:58,860
I like that.

2487
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:01,220
Wait, I can also do this.

2488
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,560
Oh, I need more houses.

2489
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:11,580
Does it now trade any buffs or no trading buffs?

2490
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:16,860
Lady, I need you to build a house.

2491
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,360
I'm going to have some neighbors.

2492
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:23,000
Alright, go grab that buddy.

2493
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,560
Yeah, that's ours.

2494
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:28,360
Tribute.

2495
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,140
You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2496
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:43,500
Slash 38.

2497
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:48,260
Oh!

2498
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,600
Oh my god.

2499
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,140
No!

2500
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:54,860
Thank you!

2501
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:56,300
Oh my god.

2502
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:57,100
Wait!

2503
02:19:01,310 --> 02:19:03,130
Can I do one for wood?

2504
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:05,270
Oh, come on monk.

2505
02:19:06,590 --> 02:19:07,250
Take it back.

2506
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:07,770
Take it back.

2507
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:19,580
Warn me.

2508
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:22,660
Don't just tell... You guys need to tell me what I'm typing in now.

2509
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:23,760
From now on.

2510
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:26,720
What's that sound?

2511
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:29,860
You guys need to tell me what I'm putting in.

2512
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:34,120
I remember what 11 is.

2513
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:35,360
Oh, food please.

2514
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:37,200
Wait, how do I send him food?

2515
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:38,680
Oh shoot, that was in the tutorial.

2516
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:40,160
Hold on.

2517
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:41,900
It was here, right?

2518
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2519
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,340
My ally, I send you food.

2520
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:49,620
There you go.

2521
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:51,340
It will be wisely spent.

2522
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:53,300
See, we're allies so I give him food.

2523
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:57,200
I remember how to do it.

2524
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:04,820
Okay.

2525
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:15,380
8-0-0-8.

2526
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,480
That's my favorite command.

2527
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:22,880
And all the women start coming to my place and they're just like...

2528
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,140
Guys,

2529
02:20:30,310 --> 02:20:30,650
stop.

2530
02:20:30,850 --> 02:20:31,090
Stop.

2531
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:31,670
Stop.

2532
02:20:31,810 --> 02:20:32,190
Stop.

2533
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:32,550
Stop.

2534
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:32,710
Stop.

2535
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:33,010
Stop.

2536
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:33,490
Stop.

2537
02:20:34,570 --> 02:20:36,850
Stop saying type this and that now, okay?

2538
02:20:38,190 --> 02:20:40,510
Especially if you're not telling me what it does, okay?

2539
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:43,670
Oh no,

2540
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:48,320
our last stone.

2541
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,960
Hey, what else do we need?

2542
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:55,940
It's for food.

2543
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,640
I don't need any more food!

2544
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:02,980
Is that our ally?

2545
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:10,600
We have some bored people waiting around.

2546
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:14,060
Oh my gosh.

2547
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:14,680
Hold on.

2548
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:17,140
What was pause again?

2549
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:22,280
How do I get this guy to trade?

2550
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,620
Maybe go to here?

2551
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:29,320
F10?

2552
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:29,980
Thank you.

2553
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:31,600
Oh, create a trade route.

2554
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:32,540
Oh, I did it.

2555
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:33,060
I did it.

2556
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:33,940
I didn't even realize.

2557
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:37,280
There we go.

2558
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:37,580
Okay.

2559
02:21:38,980 --> 02:21:40,000
Okay, okay, okay.

2560
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:41,040
Let's see.

2561
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:41,500
Let's see.

2562
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,320
Let's see.

2563
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:42,960
Let's see.

2564
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,660
Bored lady.

2565
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:45,780
What are you going to do?

2566
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:47,340
What do you want to do, lady?

2567
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:50,380
You can deforest?

2568
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:54,280
You can build?

2569
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,800
Let's... I've never built a university.

2570
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,120
Oh my gosh, we're going to have smarts.

2571
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:03,680
Oh my gosh, our people are going to be geniuses.

2572
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:08,740
Did he grab it?

2573
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:09,520
Did he bring it home?

2574
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:11,560
Oh, there it... Wait, no, that's her.

2575
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,940
Oh, there he is.

2576
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:14,160
Alright, monk.

2577
02:22:14,980 --> 02:22:16,380
Your journey continues.

2578
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:18,680
Where is it?

2579
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:20,960
What the hell is down here?

2580
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:22,120
Oh, there it is.

2581
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:24,840
Go get it.

2582
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,740
Go get it!

2583
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:37,740
The sounds are kind of ASMR.

2584
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,460
It's kind of nice.

2585
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:43,900
If I don't need this here anymore...

2586
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:48,960
If I don't need this here anymore...

2587
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:51,700
Can I like take it down and then build another one over here?

2588
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:55,860
Absolutely ASMR.

2589
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:57,400
Yeah, it's nice.

2590
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:59,960
The university has been built.

2591
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:08,930
Oh, you can just press the delete button.

2592
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:09,630
Oh, okay.

2593
02:23:12,110 --> 02:23:12,590
Nice.

2594
02:23:15,370 --> 02:23:17,190
Let's... Where is the delete button?

2595
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:20,830
Wait a second.

2596
02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:22,950
There is no delete button.

2597
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:29,110
Oh, on my keyboard.

2598
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:38,540
Oopsie.

2599
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,500
I knew that.

2600
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:48,020
Oh, he got it, he got it, he got it.

2601
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:51,300
Hi.

2602
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:51,900
Back home.

2603
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,600
Oh my god, he got it, he got it, he got it.

2604
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:56,220
We are generating gold.

2605
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,440
We are generating gold.

2606
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:01,500
I have so much food.

2607
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:04,460
Hello.

2608
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:10,640
We

2609
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,680
are rich.

2610
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:19,740
Can we make a castle?

2611
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,620
Oh, we do have a board person.

2612
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:24,520
We can.

2613
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,340
I have nothing to spare.

2614
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,560
Oh, I don't have any either.

2615
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:32,320
Sorry, buddy.

2616
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:35,780
Castle can go.

2617
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,920
We have enemies on this side.

2618
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:44,220
So I'm gonna put it over here, actually.

2619
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,060
Put it up on the hill?

2620
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,580
Just kidding.

2621
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:58,680
Put it up on the hill, lady.

2622
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,300
Oh, good placement.

2623
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:04,700
Wait.

2624
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:12,360
Maybe, like...

2625
02:25:13,220 --> 02:25:13,660
Here?

2626
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,480
Tactical choice?

2627
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,360
Should I just build it where I had it?

2628
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:24,240
I don't know.

2629
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:25,440
Gives you the high ground.

2630
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:26,020
Okay.

2631
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:28,920
Alright, lady.

2632
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:30,540
Oh my gosh, the remnants.

2633
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,420
So sad.

2634
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:33,080
You can still use that.

2635
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:34,340
You barely touched your wood.

2636
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:40,180
Oh my gosh, we're really killing it.

2637
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:47,060
Imperial age.

2638
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,020
I don't feel like we're ready.

2639
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:53,900
I don't feel like I've aged at all.

2640
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:21,860
We can afford these.

2641
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:28,460
I feel like I'm behind, especially in terms of my army.

2642
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:31,440
I do not want to get attacked right now.

2643
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:32,620
Let's see.

2644
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,780
Do I have any...

2645
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:35,360
No, no one who's bored.

2646
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:36,700
Everybody's working.

2647
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,820
Everybody's doing their jobs.

2648
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,440
Everybody's, you know...

2649
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:43,400
Please make more villagers.

2650
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:45,260
I can make four more.

2651
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,880
And then I want to have...

2652
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:53,220
We need, like, the cavalry?

2653
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:55,720
Yeah, we'll need more villagers.

2654
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:57,780
We'll need someone to build houses.

2655
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,440
We'll need someone to build places.

2656
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,280
Places.

2657
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:04,680
Piggy.

2658
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,080
OK.

2659
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:11,060
But we got good supplies, so I feel confident in that at least.

2660
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:12,680
More castles.

2661
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:13,440
We will have...

2662
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:14,960
What?

2663
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:17,120
Why are you saying that?

2664
02:27:19,220 --> 02:27:20,800
OK, they're heading out.

2665
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:25,160
No, I'm not going to do that.

2666
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:26,220
No.

2667
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:26,320
No.

2668
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,880
I did... Oh, yeah, you can build more town centers.

2669
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:34,440
Yeah, yeah.

2670
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,900
I did see that you can build those.

2671
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:41,520
OK, hold on.

2672
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:42,280
Hold on.

2673
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:47,340
Like these, like the siege... Here we go, here we go, here we go.

2674
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:48,960
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

2675
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:50,600
Here, I'll fill...

2676
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:53,820
Maybe you... Oh.

2677
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:55,580
Sorry, I thought...

2678
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:59,660
OK, you build archery.

2679
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:07,310
OK, I'm just ignoring these guys.

2680
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:07,990
Stop!

2681
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:09,470
Get out of my territory.

2682
02:28:09,810 --> 02:28:10,730
You guys are going to fall.

2683
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:11,750
You guys are going to fail.

2684
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:13,710
Don't blame me.

2685
02:28:14,330 --> 02:28:15,370
Don't blame me!

2686
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:18,230
Stable?

2687
02:28:23,020 --> 02:28:23,580
OK.

2688
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:27,430
How much bololo?

2689
02:28:28,030 --> 02:28:30,470
Actually, where is our... Oh, there he is.

2690
02:28:30,930 --> 02:28:31,930
Alright, monk.

2691
02:28:32,490 --> 02:28:33,450
Go get this one now.

2692
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,430
Actually, go to get this one.

2693
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:36,970
It seems safer.

2694
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:44,650
He's going to be tested in the very corners of the map.

2695
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:45,530
A.K.A.

2696
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:46,050
the world.

2697
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:51,510
He will see places that he's never witnessed before.

2698
02:28:53,310 --> 02:28:53,610
Hi.

2699
02:28:55,410 --> 02:28:59,950
Do you want to build a little lumber camp right here?

2700
02:29:00,810 --> 02:29:01,110
Yeah.

2701
02:29:01,830 --> 02:29:03,390
We'll get rid of this one.

2702
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:05,470
Oh wait, they're using it.

2703
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:06,930
You guys are so stupid.

2704
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:14,760
Wait, you... Wait, go over here.

2705
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,220
And you, go over here.

2706
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,960
And you, go over here.

2707
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,060
Oh my goodness.

2708
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,780
You, go over here.

2709
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:26,460
And you, go over here.

2710
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,440
Yeah, we're moving them to another forest.

2711
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,420
Okay.

2712
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:42,740
That's our friend.

2713
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,200
Where are they?

2714
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:46,780
Oh my god.

2715
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,660
Oh my god.

2716
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:57,600
Damn.

2717
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:04,610
I'm getting my stuff put together.

2718
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:13,640
Heated shots.

2719
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,080
Towers cause 125% more damage to ship.

2720
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,600
Well, that doesn't really help us, but...

2721
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:21,500
Yeah, we don't really need that.

2722
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:23,280
We have no water by us.

2723
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:26,820
Those are very efficient lumber camps.

2724
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:27,680
Yes, they are.

2725
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:33,400
Okay, you...

2726
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:34,800
Build...

2727
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:35,920
Elephant Archer!

2728
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:37,140
Oh my god!

2729
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:38,060
You guys, it's time.

2730
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:40,320
Hold on!

2731
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:43,360
It's time.

2732
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:43,580
It's time.

2733
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:46,680
It's time!

2734
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:50,460
For the elephant army.

2735
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:52,420
Crossbowmen.

2736
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:54,880
You know what?

2737
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:55,460
Just upgrade.

2738
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:57,060
Oh wait.

2739
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:57,640
Oh good.

2740
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:58,780
I do have...

2741
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:00,240
I do have...

2742
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,320
We have some board people.

2743
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:03,820
Build some houses, please.

2744
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:08,400
These guys are like super neighbors.

2745
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:11,260
And you...

2746
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:11,840
Wait.

2747
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:15,260
Hey, you also...

2748
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:17,800
What?

2749
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:21,500
I'm kind of confused what building another town hall will do.

2750
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:22,380
Honestly.

2751
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:26,060
I'm kind of confused about it.

2752
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:29,720
Why don't we build another castle?

2753
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,420
Because we are really cool.

2754
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:36,280
You can help.

2755
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:36,940
Adish.

2756
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,260
Let's you pump up villages faster.

2757
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:46,020
You can queue commands by pressing shift.

2758
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:47,760
Wait, what do you mean?

2759
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:54,860
Did I get the siege workshop?

2760
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:57,600
No.

2761
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,160
We got an elephant!

2762
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:07,700
I'm still making more elephants.

2763
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:08,880
I need to calm down.

2764
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:12,660
Did our monk ever come back?

2765
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:14,500
Oh, he's got it!

2766
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,520
How goes the empire?

2767
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,680
I think we are winning.

2768
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:23,780
I think.

2769
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,120
Never enough elephants.

2770
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:25,520
True!

2771
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,740
More elephants.

2772
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:31,020
Needs more elephants.

2773
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,960
We got our guys with the stone.

2774
02:32:35,860 --> 02:32:37,760
Are they still attacking over there?

2775
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:39,860
Holy moly, they are.

2776
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,120
They are really taking them down.

2777
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:43,300
Come on.

2778
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:47,440
And this can also do stuff.

2779
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:47,900
I forgot.

2780
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:50,000
Elephants attack faster.

2781
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:53,400
I don't have so much wood, but we'll still invest.

2782
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:07,440
Send the foreclosure tax.

2783
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:09,140
Yes.

2784
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:14,160
Where did the monk go?

2785
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:16,380
I don't see him anymore.

2786
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:21,100
Oh yeah, baby.

2787
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:21,300
Hello.

2788
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:22,400
Oh there he is!

2789
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:24,020
Oh my gosh, monk with relic.

2790
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:25,240
There he is!

2791
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:27,820
Go to war because others say it's cause.

2792
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:35,000
Is there a way to see how much gold it produces?

2793
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:37,400
Monks can convert enemy buildings.

2794
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:41,180
War monk.

2795
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,680
Monks can convert enemy monks!

2796
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,800
That's messed up.

2797
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:48,360
Units garrisoned in buildings heal...

2798
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:52,360
I guess if we get attacked...

2799
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:56,800
And we don't want to be converted.

2800
02:33:58,360 --> 02:33:59,200
Wololo.

2801
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,620
What is Wololo command everybody?

2802
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:04,080
Oh my god.

2803
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:09,960
They are so bloodthirsty.

2804
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:10,500
Yeah.

2805
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:17,340
Wololo.

2806
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:21,360
They are so bloodthirsty.

2807
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,160
My god.

2808
02:34:28,340 --> 02:34:30,320
And they keep coming through our territory.

2809
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:33,300
I'm building an army.

2810
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:34,140
I'll come to you.

2811
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:34,840
I'll come to you.

2812
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:39,460
We'll come.

2813
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:39,820
We'll come.

2814
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:40,200
We'll come.

2815
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:41,320
Eventually.

2816
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:46,100
I gotta get my guys up to speed though.

2817
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:49,360
And then, and then, and then...

2818
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:51,420
We go to the imperial age.

2819
02:34:54,380 --> 02:34:54,900
Wololo.

2820
02:34:59,100 --> 02:34:59,620
Wololo.

2821
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:00,480
Wololo.

2822
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,620
Alright, monk.

2823
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,420
What other relics do we have?

2824
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,120
Wow, there are so many on this side.

2825
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:10,060
Is this normal?

2826
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,860
Is this how many there usually are?

2827
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:14,420
Are they

2828
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:18,740
chopping wood?

2829
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:21,980
Why are you chopping wood all the way over here?

2830
02:35:22,820 --> 02:35:23,720
Oh, wood please.

2831
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:25,940
Oh, I don't really have that much.

2832
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:27,040
Sorry, friend.

2833
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:31,220
On a ludicrous map, yes.

2834
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:31,660
Wow.

2835
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:34,840
Nice.

2836
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:36,120
Okay.

2837
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:37,820
Oh, you're a villager?

2838
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:43,560
Actually, go mine over there.

2839
02:35:45,740 --> 02:35:46,180
Elephants.

2840
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:48,440
What else can we build?

2841
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:50,120
Oh, we can make more elephants.

2842
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:53,040
Cool.

2843
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:56,620
Oh my gosh, I have three bored villagers.

2844
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:57,860
What should we make them do?

2845
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:13,160
Okay, I'm just gonna get rid of all my gold.

2846
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:15,520
I need you to mine more gold.

2847
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:17,300
Make them play MGS.

2848
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:20,700
Build more elephants.

2849
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:22,640
Okay, I am...

2850
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:25,740
We're totally getting more elephants?

2851
02:36:27,100 --> 02:36:28,080
Check the stable.

2852
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:30,520
Oh, the stable.

2853
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:31,540
This one.

2854
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:33,120
Thank you.

2855
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:34,540
Oh my gosh, search cavalry.

2856
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:35,960
Light cavalry.

2857
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:36,960
Upgrade.

2858
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:39,160
Research blood mines.

2859
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:42,640
Yeah, take him down!

2860
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:44,860
Oh god, he's so fast.

2861
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:46,880
And we're so slow.

2862
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:48,860
There they go.

2863
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:54,700
We didn't even get a single shot on this guy.

2864
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:26,780
Oh, you have a relic.

2865
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:29,360
Oh my god.

2866
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:34,720
This guy, are you gonna attack him?

2867
02:37:37,540 --> 02:37:39,200
Who are you attacking now?

2868
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,720
Who are you attacking?

2869
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:45,160
Oh my god, they're building right next to this.

2870
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:47,200
Are the green guys our friends?

2871
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:49,420
Yeah, they're our friends.

2872
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:52,220
Wait, I could change that at any time though.

2873
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,360
I could change that at any time for now, yeah.

2874
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,600
Oh my goodness.

2875
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,800
Wow, their place is so clean and neat looking.

2876
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:11,100
And mine is...

2877
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:15,940
Guys, I'm not meant for leadership.

2878
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,220
Yeah, they're a good shield for...

2879
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:23,820
They're very bloodthirsty though, I'm afraid of...

2880
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:25,960
I'm afraid of them a little bit.

2881
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:30,840
Okay, we need more long swordsmen and some more pikemen.

2882
02:38:40,530 --> 02:38:42,130
Bring it home!

2883
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:46,900
You're supposed to attack people.

2884
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:48,740
I know, I'm building my army.

2885
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:55,700
They're just a little slow.

2886
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:59,160
They're just a little slow, you know?

2887
02:39:08,460 --> 02:39:09,860
Let's get some crossbows.

2888
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,360
Oh, some more elephants.

2889
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:23,820
Reminds me of how I played when I was a kid.

2890
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:28,360
Wait a minute.

2891
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:29,960
We're doing okay.

2892
02:39:30,580 --> 02:39:31,620
Right, guys?

2893
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:36,740
We're doing alright.

2894
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:38,340
It's fine.

2895
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:50,800
We're building our army.

2896
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:53,680
It's gotta be big and powerful.

2897
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,640
Alright, we have some two bored people.

2898
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:02,080
Alright, let's start building walls now, yeah?

2899
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:06,160
Let's start building some walls.

2900
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:24,250
Actually, I don't know how I wanna build the walls.

2901
02:40:25,970 --> 02:40:27,570
I don't know how I wanna build them.

2902
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:30,770
I'm not sure.

2903
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:35,950
You're missing ballistics from the university.

2904
02:40:36,470 --> 02:40:37,610
Oh, is that a thing?

2905
02:40:39,430 --> 02:40:42,130
Hit fire more accurately at moving targets.

2906
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:44,550
That sounds important to invest in.

2907
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:49,850
That sounds important to invest in.

2908
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:52,210
Wow, there's hotkeys for everything in this game.

2909
02:40:52,570 --> 02:40:53,870
Murder holes!

2910
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:59,290
Eliminates the minimum range for all towers.

2911
02:41:00,130 --> 02:41:02,090
So they can fire at enemies attacking their bays.

2912
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:04,950
Oh my god!

2913
02:41:06,230 --> 02:41:07,670
Oh my god!

2914
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:09,790
He's already on the move!

2915
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:14,210
Who's fighting?

2916
02:41:14,490 --> 02:41:15,070
Oh my god.

2917
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:20,490
The yellow guys are just like us.

2918
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:21,310
They're so chill.

2919
02:41:21,430 --> 02:41:21,950
Oh no!

2920
02:41:22,290 --> 02:41:23,250
What happened to you?

2921
02:41:26,150 --> 02:41:28,070
Uh oh, they have...

2922
02:41:30,850 --> 02:41:33,630
No, you have to fight back!

2923
02:41:34,690 --> 02:41:36,230
I'm being attacked by wild animals.

2924
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:36,470
Where?

2925
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:38,410
Oh my god.

2926
02:41:40,010 --> 02:41:40,610
Where?

2927
02:41:42,490 --> 02:41:43,050
Where?

2928
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:44,850
Oh, they got him.

2929
02:41:45,350 --> 02:41:45,750
Easy.

2930
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:53,080
Then back to mining.

2931
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:56,540
He didn't care at all.

2932
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,060
Should I go help him?

2933
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:07,340
Oh no, he's attac... Oh, he converted them.

2934
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:11,600
Oh my god, he converted the guy who was just attacking the building.

2935
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:16,680
Wow.

2936
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:18,600
Why you no attack enemy now?

2937
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:20,860
Should we go attack an enemy?

2938
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:29,380
Let me build walls and then we'll go attack an enemy.

2939
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:34,340
Where's my monk?

2940
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:36,600
Oh, there's the monk.

2941
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,340
Wait, who's over there?

2942
02:42:40,760 --> 02:42:43,320
I... I... I... Wait.

2943
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:45,360
No wonder thou wert victorious.

2944
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:47,820
Loser?

2945
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:51,880
Don't need walls?

2946
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:52,860
I want walls!

2947
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:59,780
That makes us feel legit if we have walls.

2948
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:02,980
He'll resign.

2949
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,780
Oh my god, they literally...

2950
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:08,580
They're off the map.

2951
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:12,900
Wow, they were up here, weren't they?

2952
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:14,680
How sad.

2953
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:18,260
Snoozy lose, I guess.

2954
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:19,640
That's us, actually.

2955
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:24,600
Okay.

2956
02:43:26,040 --> 02:43:27,480
We have big army.

2957
02:43:29,300 --> 02:43:29,800
Come on, monk.

2958
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:34,560
We're gonna put you to... Okay, we have two people that need to be put to work.

2959
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:39,800
Let's have you build a mining camp right here.

2960
02:43:40,700 --> 02:43:42,480
I'm gonna delete this one.

2961
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:45,120
Oh wait, we'll delete it once this one's built.

2962
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,080
Yeah, build that.

2963
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,020
What was that gif?

2964
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:53,120
What gif?

2965
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:54,000
I didn't see one.

2966
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:57,120
What gif?

2967
02:43:59,300 --> 02:44:00,820
I didn't see it.

2968
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:06,880
She even gave her housing space.

2969
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:09,740
Yeah, because look, you want them to be happy.

2970
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:13,640
Okay.

2971
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:16,760
Should be done in two seconds.

2972
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:22,860
Okay, goodbye.

2973
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:24,800
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2974
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:26,840
It was spooky?

2975
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,600
Was it a streamlabs thing?

2976
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:31,160
Oh my god.

2977
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:31,600
Okay!

2978
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,840
I'm gonna attack!

2979
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:37,940
I'm gonna attack.

2980
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:40,840
I'll attack.

2981
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:41,880
Hold on.

2982
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:43,880
Hold on!

2983
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:49,910
We're attacking!

2984
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:52,910
Oh, I built two crossbow things, I just realized.

2985
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:53,810
Armored elephant!

2986
02:44:55,790 --> 02:44:59,630
Okay, as soon as our army is done, we move.

2987
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:02,050
As soon as their...

2988
02:45:04,830 --> 02:45:06,770
He's out here like, Adish?

2989
02:45:07,470 --> 02:45:08,110
Adish?

2990
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:21,680
More elephants, please.

2991
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:30,860
Oh my gosh, we're out of wood!

2992
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:34,440
Uh...

2993
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:35,660
Hold on, no, no, oh wait.

2994
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,220
You...oh, there's no more.

2995
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:40,060
Build it right here.

2996
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,900
Finally, ally support.

2997
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:51,660
I will, I will, I will.

2998
02:45:52,220 --> 02:45:53,160
You need more houses.

2999
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:53,880
Oh shoot.

3000
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:55,260
I need more houses.

3001
02:45:56,580 --> 02:45:57,540
Yeah, hey!

3002
02:45:57,800 --> 02:46:00,580
Can you like, build a neighborhood right here?

3003
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:04,060
Can you like, I want it to look pretty.

3004
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:04,920
Oh look, look, look.

3005
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:08,580
See, for everyone who's saying...

3006
02:46:11,980 --> 02:46:13,600
Yeah, you come build this.

3007
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:16,580
The housing market.

3008
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,280
We need more.

3009
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:21,220
We need to build more houses!

3010
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:26,160
Okay.

3011
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3012
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:32,880
Build that house, build that house.

3013
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:36,440
Hammer that wood, hammer that wood.

3014
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:39,440
Hit that stone, hit that stone.

3015
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,880
Never thought I'd hear my Oshi speak Bengali.

3016
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:49,380
That's the power of Age of Empires.

3017
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:55,240
Do, do, do...castles also give housing.

3018
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:58,100
Actually, that's a good idea.

3019
02:47:02,160 --> 02:47:02,720
More.

3020
02:47:11,020 --> 02:47:12,300
Who are we going to go attack?

3021
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:20,640
I guess we'll go attack the orange guys.

3022
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:23,260
They got purple pretty much down.

3023
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:27,340
Everybody ready?

3024
02:47:29,740 --> 02:47:30,380
Hi.

3025
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:33,260
Let's go!

3026
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:38,500
What the hell is that sound?

3027
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:41,420
Oh, it shot down someone.

3028
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:45,780
57.

3029
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:46,960
Perfect.

3030
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:52,140
On the road to kill.

3031
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:55,180
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

3032
02:47:55,380 --> 02:47:56,320
I'm going to attack!

3033
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:57,880
I'm going to go kill.

3034
02:47:58,060 --> 02:47:59,480
Wait, how many groups are left?

3035
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:08,510
Orange...wait, where is...

3036
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:13,130
We don't know where silver guys are.

3037
02:48:14,310 --> 02:48:15,150
So let's go up.

3038
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:16,070
They might be here.

3039
02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:18,530
Right?

3040
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:24,070
They might be...

3041
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:27,890
I am player number 7.

3042
02:48:27,990 --> 02:48:28,230
Where?

3043
02:48:28,650 --> 02:48:29,330
Oh my god.

3044
02:48:29,770 --> 02:48:31,210
You son of a bitch.

3045
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:33,690
Where did you come from?

3046
02:48:38,290 --> 02:48:40,070
The elephants are lagging the game.

3047
02:48:40,930 --> 02:48:43,490
I was just on my way to attack you.

3048
02:48:45,150 --> 02:48:49,770
Also, I just noticed our scout is all the way out here.

3049
02:48:52,710 --> 02:48:53,870
This is purple.

3050
02:48:53,870 --> 02:48:56,870
Where is the...

3051
02:48:57,570 --> 02:48:58,410
Am I crazy?

3052
02:48:58,550 --> 02:48:59,790
I don't see the grey guys.

3053
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:04,550
I see yellow, I see orange, but I don't see grey on the map.

3054
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:09,400
Okay guys, let's go.

3055
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,960
They must be up here, right?

3056
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:16,840
They gotta be like up here.

3057
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:20,200
Somewhere.

3058
02:49:22,300 --> 02:49:24,020
North of the orange?

3059
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:33,550
We're coming!

3060
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:42,930
We're coming!

3061
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:44,830
These are the orange guys.

3062
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:46,990
We're coming!

3063
02:49:48,490 --> 02:49:49,130
We're coming!

3064
02:49:49,710 --> 02:49:52,270
Actually, maybe we...

3065
02:49:52,270 --> 02:49:52,810
What's this group?

3066
02:49:54,290 --> 02:49:56,790
This is still... This is not orange.

3067
02:49:57,910 --> 02:49:58,810
I don't know.

3068
02:49:59,090 --> 02:49:59,510
We're coming!

3069
02:50:01,370 --> 02:50:02,430
This way!

3070
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:08,300
They'll make it eventually.

3071
02:50:09,380 --> 02:50:10,100
Trust.

3072
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:15,820
They just walked past.

3073
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:28,610
The castle will take care of it.

3074
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:39,030
They're on their way.

3075
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:45,680
They're going.

3076
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:49,100
Preparing to attack.

3077
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:50,280
Where is that?

3078
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,240
The orange.

3079
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:56,360
I think...

3080
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:00,140
You're a little behind.

3081
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:08,230
Your monks are slowing the army?

3082
02:51:08,530 --> 02:51:09,590
No way, it's the monk?

3083
02:51:12,870 --> 02:51:13,350
Monk...

3084
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:14,750
No...

3085
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:17,990
If I make him go home...

3086
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,750
Oh I have two of them.

3087
02:51:20,530 --> 02:51:21,470
Come on monk.

3088
02:51:24,310 --> 02:51:26,010
I don't think they got any faster.

3089
02:51:27,390 --> 02:51:28,250
Reissue the command?

3090
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:28,690
Really?

3091
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:29,190
Okay.

3092
02:51:30,790 --> 02:51:31,750
I am!

3093
02:51:32,350 --> 02:51:33,010
Oh I am.

3094
02:51:33,170 --> 02:51:34,230
I'm gonna go attack an enemy.

3095
02:51:35,090 --> 02:51:36,750
What the hell is that?

3096
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:45,800
What is that?

3097
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,820
Yeah, they didn't get much faster.

3098
02:51:54,880 --> 02:51:57,280
They didn't get much faster.

3099
02:51:58,660 --> 02:52:01,360
Anyway, you guys wanna go get those relics?

3100
02:52:02,480 --> 02:52:03,100
Where were they?

3101
02:52:06,510 --> 02:52:08,070
The elephants are slow.

3102
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:09,630
Yeah, I think that's the problem.

3103
02:52:09,810 --> 02:52:10,430
That's okay though.

3104
02:52:10,970 --> 02:52:11,390
They're good.

3105
02:52:14,750 --> 02:52:17,850
They had so many relics, way more than me.

3106
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:21,870
Wait, where was I going before?

3107
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:22,850
It was this way.

3108
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:24,430
Let's go get this instead.

3109
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:26,850
Reroute, reroute a little bit.

3110
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:29,070
Yeah.

3111
02:52:32,140 --> 02:52:33,380
Those are our friends.

3112
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,500
We're on an epic adventure.

3113
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:42,820
They're gonna go get the relics.

3114
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:00,700
What are you doing out here?

3115
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:02,340
I'm lost.

3116
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:05,560
I don't know where to go.

3117
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:09,040
Oh my gosh, Amita!

3118
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:10,640
Thanks for the...

3119
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:12,900
Thanks for the super chat, girl.

3120
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:15,060
I wasn't hiding.

3121
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:17,080
I was waiting for you, baby girl.

3122
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:20,100
What's this?

3123
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:25,920
We can take it down, whatever it is.

3124
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:27,600
We can destroy something.

3125
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:33,640
We destroyed something.

3126
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:36,100
We took it down.

3127
02:53:36,180 --> 02:53:37,480
We took it down.

3128
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:39,200
He already resigned.

3129
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:40,860
Yeah, but we still got it.

3130
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:43,480
We still showed our dominance.

3131
02:53:46,060 --> 02:53:47,220
I like that.

3132
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:52,920
And now we build more elephants to attack the red team.

3133
02:53:56,650 --> 02:53:57,550
Relic pickup.

3134
02:53:57,850 --> 02:53:58,690
Good job guys.

3135
02:53:58,790 --> 02:53:59,290
Where are you?

3136
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:02,590
Oh my god!

3137
02:54:03,390 --> 02:54:04,550
Oh my god!

3138
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:07,310
Those guys... He got his own relic.

3139
02:54:08,090 --> 02:54:12,270
I hope he didn't see the gold mine that's right here.

3140
02:54:16,730 --> 02:54:17,790
We're almost there.

3141
02:54:18,590 --> 02:54:20,290
And no one is attacking this building yet.

3142
02:54:20,970 --> 02:54:22,350
We'll be the one to attack it.

3143
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:23,730
Oh my god.

3144
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:27,090
Oh my god.

3145
02:54:27,470 --> 02:54:27,950
Oh my god.

3146
02:54:28,030 --> 02:54:28,270
Oh my god.

3147
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:28,610
Oh my god.

3148
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:32,860
Is it time?

3149
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:35,400
Imperial Age?

3150
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,420
Yeah, it's time for the Imperial Age.

3151
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:55,440
I am!

3152
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:01,060
Minto conquering like she's conquered our hearts.

3153
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:06,420
Praying for you, oh great Minto.

3154
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:10,900
Hello!

3155
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:12,760
Oh my god.

3156
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:20,460
Anyway...

3157
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:22,640
Destroy!

3158
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:23,940
Destroy!

3159
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:26,820
You guys kill that thing.

3160
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:33,220
You guys destroy this thing.

3161
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,800
Destroy everything!

3162
02:55:40,140 --> 02:55:43,120
Make sure nothing stands.

3163
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:45,580
Everything must fall!

3164
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:51,680
I did it.

3165
02:55:58,370 --> 02:56:00,230
Wait, my betrayal.

3166
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:02,370
No!

3167
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:07,480
Oh no!

3168
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:09,000
They never got their relic.

3169
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:10,040
No!

3170
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:12,280
My Imperial Age!

3171
02:56:17,220 --> 02:56:17,720
No!

3172
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:25,140
1v1?

3173
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:26,440
Should we try 1v1?

3174
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:29,780
It's so quiet now.

3175
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:39,760
I don't think I needed three allies.

3176
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:40,420
You know what I mean?

3177
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:42,580
Oh wait, when a game playing as the Bengalis.

3178
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:44,420
Oh, it disappeared.

3179
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:50,250
Hope the Whisperer is prospering.

3180
02:56:50,250 --> 02:56:54,710
I love your recent comedic taste in dying electronics.

3181
02:56:55,790 --> 02:56:58,650
Ever seen the demon possess singing trout?

3182
02:56:58,930 --> 02:56:59,390
Oh yes!

3183
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:00,330
I love those.

3184
02:57:00,470 --> 02:57:02,550
I do love dying electronics.

3185
02:57:03,150 --> 02:57:07,690
The thumbnail for this stream is perfection.

3186
02:57:09,610 --> 02:57:12,390
All hail, king of the losers!

3187
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:18,590
We didn't even get most valuable player.

3188
02:57:18,590 --> 02:57:19,750
But look at this!

3189
02:57:20,250 --> 02:57:23,510
You guys, we excelled in everything but military.

3190
02:57:26,770 --> 02:57:28,870
Look at our score!

3191
02:57:29,050 --> 02:57:29,910
We swept!

3192
02:57:30,830 --> 02:57:32,210
We swept!

3193
02:57:32,910 --> 02:57:36,970
How did they get most valuable player and not me?

3194
02:57:38,690 --> 02:57:40,730
Am I not a valuable player?

3195
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:45,040
Look at the timeline.

3196
02:57:46,860 --> 02:57:47,540
Look!

3197
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:51,660
I don't know what this means.

3198
02:57:53,460 --> 02:57:55,500
What does this mean?

3199
02:57:57,680 --> 02:57:58,300
Koa!

3200
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:01,800
Koa!

3201
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:02,660
Hello!

3202
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:08,390
Hello!

3203
02:58:08,910 --> 02:58:09,570
I'm Minto!

3204
02:58:11,690 --> 02:58:13,510
Thank you!

3205
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:17,810
I love you!

3206
02:58:18,510 --> 02:58:19,990
Koa only!

3207
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:41,560
Minto!

3208
02:58:43,240 --> 02:58:45,360
Game good!

3209
02:58:57,980 --> 02:59:03,460
Thanks for all the gifts!

3210
02:59:03,820 --> 02:59:04,480
Very good!

3211
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:05,860
Thank you!

3212
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:20,830
That's all.

3213
02:59:21,250 --> 02:59:21,690
I know.

3214
02:59:25,130 --> 02:59:26,570
Thank you for the... Thank you!

3215
02:59:26,770 --> 02:59:27,630
Thanks, Sherry!

3216
02:59:30,930 --> 02:59:32,970
What does spectate with CA?

3217
02:59:47,720 --> 02:59:49,320
Minto is good.

3218
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:53,200
Yes.

3219
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:02,610
Capture H.

3220
03:00:03,090 --> 03:00:04,530
Tool for watching replays.

3221
03:00:05,250 --> 03:00:07,810
Well, we can go to the main menu.

3222
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:13,190
And I think... I think next time we play...

3223
03:00:13,190 --> 03:00:14,630
I want to play with you guys.

3224
03:00:14,730 --> 03:00:16,750
I want to do like a multiplayer.

3225
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:20,390
I want to host my own game.

3226
03:00:22,370 --> 03:00:24,930
And we can make a big empire.

3227
03:00:27,290 --> 03:00:29,530
Maybe like a 4v4 or something.

3228
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:33,790
I will excel in everything but military.

3229
03:00:36,090 --> 03:00:37,150
No, no, no.

3230
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:37,770
I'll do good.

3231
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:40,870
That will be fun.

3232
03:00:42,590 --> 03:00:44,730
How big of a lobby can we do?

3233
03:00:47,510 --> 03:00:48,050
Eight.

3234
03:00:48,690 --> 03:00:50,510
So yeah, it will be 4v4.

3235
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:54,490
I will make a password.

3236
03:00:54,670 --> 03:00:55,510
I can allow...

3237
03:00:56,110 --> 03:00:56,410
Wait.

3238
03:00:56,690 --> 03:00:58,850
So allow or disallow people from spectating.

3239
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:05,380
That's fancy.

3240
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:06,880
Spectator.

3241
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:08,700
I think it's because it's private.

3242
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:14,040
I guess it doesn't matter if I make it public or private, right?

3243
03:01:21,470 --> 03:01:23,690
People will be imperial before you're feudal.

3244
03:01:23,750 --> 03:01:24,230
That's okay.

3245
03:01:24,470 --> 03:01:25,690
I'm still learning.

3246
03:01:27,270 --> 03:01:28,030
It's okay.

3247
03:01:28,250 --> 03:01:30,210
I think it would just be fun to play with everybody though.

3248
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:32,270
You know?

3249
03:01:34,210 --> 03:01:35,250
1v1 deathmatch.

3250
03:01:35,910 --> 03:01:36,430
Scary.

3251
03:01:40,050 --> 03:01:42,730
Public means randoms that aren't wisps might join though.

3252
03:01:44,210 --> 03:01:48,290
I think though we would probably have enough people wanting to...

3253
03:01:48,290 --> 03:01:53,090
Probably enough people joining quick enough that it would fill up, you know?

3254
03:01:53,210 --> 03:01:54,910
Can I still join even if I'm stupid?

3255
03:01:55,170 --> 03:01:55,410
Yeah!

3256
03:01:55,950 --> 03:01:57,850
I'm stupid when it comes to the game too.

3257
03:02:00,910 --> 03:02:02,110
You can set a password?

3258
03:02:02,290 --> 03:02:02,950
Wait, even on...

3259
03:02:03,310 --> 03:02:05,250
No, you can only set a password if it's private.

3260
03:02:06,890 --> 03:02:07,870
Oh, just kidding.

3261
03:02:08,710 --> 03:02:09,470
Just kidding?

3262
03:02:11,690 --> 03:02:12,930
Mint-toe.

3263
03:02:14,850 --> 03:02:15,930
Mint-toes.

3264
03:02:16,670 --> 03:02:20,150
And now we got a lot... That could work!

3265
03:02:22,070 --> 03:02:23,210
That could work.

3266
03:02:25,210 --> 03:02:27,010
Are you doing a game now?

3267
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:27,390
No, no, no.

3268
03:02:28,050 --> 03:02:32,910
I think I'm done for tonight, but I had fun playing games of Empire.

3269
03:02:33,610 --> 03:02:34,770
This is so fun.

3270
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:45,610
I will... I might play off stream too and get maybe a little bit better.

3271
03:02:47,270 --> 03:02:53,130
Or a little bit more used to... You know, I only did the tutorial and then Dracula.

3272
03:02:54,530 --> 03:03:01,550
So, if I play a little bit more in the single player, I think I might get more used to it.

3273
03:03:01,550 --> 03:03:02,330
Yeah!

3274
03:03:03,390 --> 03:03:03,830
Yeah!

3275
03:03:06,530 --> 03:03:07,730
This is really fun, thank you.

3276
03:03:07,810 --> 03:03:08,430
Thank you guys!

3277
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:10,050
Thanks for helping me out.

3278
03:03:10,930 --> 03:03:14,390
And next time... Next time we'll play together, okay?

3279
03:03:16,950 --> 03:03:18,410
Next time we'll play together.

3280
03:03:20,410 --> 03:03:22,270
Yeah, Art of War is a good tutorial.

3281
03:03:23,350 --> 03:03:23,890
Was that a campaign?

3282
03:03:24,990 --> 03:03:25,870
Art of War.

3283
03:03:33,010 --> 03:03:33,890
Advanced techniques?

3284
03:03:35,210 --> 03:03:35,790
Oh...

3285
03:03:42,830 --> 03:03:44,090
It's really fun to watch.

3286
03:03:44,170 --> 03:03:45,310
Thank you guys!

3287
03:03:45,850 --> 03:03:46,550
Thank you!

3288
03:03:46,930 --> 03:03:51,170
Have a good night, have a good day and I'll see you guys next time!

3289
03:03:51,650 --> 03:03:52,210
Otsumito!

3290
03:03:52,650 --> 03:03:53,110
Otsumito!

3291
03:03:53,230 --> 03:03:53,670
Otsumito!

3292
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:55,370
Itterasshai!

3293
03:03:55,730 --> 03:03:56,450
Thank you guys!

3294
03:03:57,190 --> 03:03:57,710
See you!

3295
03:03:57,830 --> 03:03:58,490
Bye bye!

3296
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:51,660
See ya!
