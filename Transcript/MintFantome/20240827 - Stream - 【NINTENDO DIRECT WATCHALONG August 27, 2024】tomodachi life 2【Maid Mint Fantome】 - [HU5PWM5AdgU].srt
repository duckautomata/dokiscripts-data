1
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,370
Ah, okay, there we go.

2
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,070
Sorry, because I unplugged my stuff.

3
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,450
I had to reset it back up.

4
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,350
Dang it, you guys missed my really awesome intro.

5
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,490
Should I try it again?

6
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,170
Should I do it again?

7
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,960
Yeah?

8
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,260
Okay, hold on...

9
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,180
I just wanna be part of your symphony!

10
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,600
That's it, that's the intro.

11
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,190
I just wanna be part of your symphony!

12
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,190
That's the intro.

13
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,790
Oh my gosh, you guys!

14
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,550
I'm so...

15
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,350
I'm so tired.

16
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,570
I'm so sleepy.

17
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,750
I have a green smoothie here.

18
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,950
I have vitamin water.

19
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,510
And I ate two eggs.

20
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,330
The two eggs were my dinner.

21
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,610
I'm looking at my bed and I'm just like oh my gosh it looks so comfy.

22
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,730
What about coffee?

23
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,690
It's like almost 11 p.m.

24
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,730
I don't want to have coffee.

25
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,350
I gotta wake up and stream.

26
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,190
So I have to sleep enough.

27
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,410
You know?

28
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,890
To then stream and be with energy in the morning.

29
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,150
What's so different from the overnight drive back from AMIC?

30
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,710
I missed yesterday's stream.

31
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:22,370
What would A++++ plus would A++++ would hamtaro circle again.

32
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,210
Thank you.

33
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,930
I'm so tired.

34
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,290
Oh my gosh.

35
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,210
Take care Minto.

36
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:30,990
Thank you.

37
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,790
You're welcome Minto.

38
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,390
Thanks.

39
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,090
Oh I forgot to take my medicine.

40
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:49,830
So if you ever get medicine in Japan it's you know you always hear how, your medicine and tablet medicine in Japan is not as strong right?

41
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,490
But they they make you take a lot of it.

42
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:04,050
Like like I have this medicine they recommend you to take it take three pills.

43
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,890
Three times a day!

44
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,710
That's nine pills a day!

45
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,930
That's insane!

46
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,250
You guys were just crazy at the three.

47
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,390
Three?

48
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,030
No, no.

49
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,490
It's three pills, three times a day!

50
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,890
I only took some this morning and I'm starting to like...

51
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,230
I'm weaning off the meds, you guys.

52
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,450
My waifu will come back.

53
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,650
She's gonna come back, you guys.

54
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,870
I can already see her arm phasing in.

55
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,290
Because I'm only taking it two times a day instead of three.

56
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
But we're doing the... that was one pill.

57
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
We're doing the Nintendo Partner Showcase.

58
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,040
I never... I never see when Nintendo Directs are.

59
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,880
So... thanks for everybody who tells me when these things are.

60
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,200
Because otherwise... that's why they're always like last minute.

61
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,560
Because I'm like, oh, there's a Direct?

62
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay.

63
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,320
But I think it's the Indie one first and then...

64
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,460
Are you screening the vid?

65
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,120
Yeah.

66
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,680
I have it on behind me.

67
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll move my big head once it's time to start.

68
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,680
Don't worry.

69
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,320
Crazy they're all suppository.

70
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,860
No, they're not.

71
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,020
I didn't say it.

72
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,660
I literally just swallowed it right now!

73
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,800
Shut the heck up!

74
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,780
Did you see IGN said MGS Delta is not great because it's so faithful and not modernized.

75
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,260
Oh my gosh.

76
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,760
I saw... I did not read their...

77
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,120
I did not read... whatever they said or watch whatever they said.

78
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
But I heard about it.

79
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,780
Which is just so...

80
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,500
What?

81
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,820
Wow.

82
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,520
My Metal Gear Solid 3 game is too much like Metal Gear Solid 3.

83
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,140
What an L.

84
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,340
They complain about the loading screens.

85
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,020
Okay.

86
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,660
Sure.

87
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,840
Whatever.

88
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,760
We'll see.

89
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,170
Speaking of Metal Gear...

90
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,330
I don't know if they want to say it or if they want me to say it or what.

91
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,510
I have to probably move Holocure a little bit for the times.

92
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,370
Push it back.

93
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,870
I don't know.

94
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,910
Maybe an hour or two.

95
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,830
Because...

96
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:09,390
Because I have some other stuff on Thursday that I forgot to put on my calendar.

97
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,290
Remember the too much water review.

98
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,130
I don't know why you guys are getting so worked up.

99
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,010
It's not anything so... you know.

100
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,550
I don't know what you're expecting.

101
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,850
I don't know what you're expecting.

102
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,410
Can I have a drink?

103
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:30,570
Um...

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,200
Is this where I put the money to make sure Silksong is in the direct?

105
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,500
Yeah.

106
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,140
Yeah.

107
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,880
Just send it over.

108
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,060
I'll take it.

109
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,260
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Just send it over.

111
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,580
To me.

112
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,820
You know.

113
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,860
And I'll take it.

114
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,440
No worries.

115
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,080
I got it.

116
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you.

117
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,980
Okay.

118
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,100
For...

119
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,860
I don't even know what to expect for this though.

120
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,680
Because it's all partner stuff.

121
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,160
It could be anything.

122
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,100
Who knows?

123
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,520
Everybody wants Silksong.

124
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm here for Ace Combat.

125
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,640
Yeah, I want to see the stuff about Ace Combat.

126
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,880
If they say anything.

127
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,440
Of course you're here, Nan, for Ace Combat.

128
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,360
I still can't believe you have the power to make people run in a circle.

129
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
Hamtaro's theme is still stuck in my head.

130
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,340
I was singing it earlier too, I'll be honest.

131
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,860
Along with, I just wanna be part of your symphony.

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,540
This combat is not Switch focused.

133
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,380
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,240
It's literally coming out on the Switch.

135
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,360
They just announced it.

136
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,740
Like, not even that long ago.

137
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,960
So they could, you know, talk about it here.

138
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,040
You know?

139
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,920
New Ace Attorney?

140
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,620
Oh my gosh.

141
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,040
I would... I would cry.

142
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,200
Cry for new Ace Attorney.

143
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,220
Though I'm one game behind.

144
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,960
Well, technically.

145
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,220
But they announced the Edgeworth stuff last time.

146
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,680
Which was very exciting.

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,580
I yelled.

148
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,700
Oh, it's already out for the Switch.

149
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,900
Sorry, I'm so tired of guys.

150
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Return of Godot.

151
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,820
I thought, I'll be honest, I thought about that.

152
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,020
I was like, they're gonna add him back.

153
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
They're gonna bring him back.

154
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,980
They're gonna bring him back.

155
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,460
They're gonna resurrect him.

156
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,640
Please.

157
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,230
Maybe the stream was a mistake.

158
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,230
Oh gosh.

159
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,810
Maybe I should have just said, sorry guys.

160
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,390
My eyelids are too heavy.

161
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,270
Is that my phone?

162
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,390
Oh, there it is.

163
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,070
Yeah.

164
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,270
Trusting you with my Silksong money.

165
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,250
Everybody place your Silksong bets here.

166
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,730
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

167
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,090
Hello.

168
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:02,690
Hello.

169
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

170
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,810
Jump scare.

171
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,370
Holy cow.

172
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,010
Okay.

173
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,610
Thank you.

174
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,030
First up, here's the Indie World Showcase.

175
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,950
Okay, first Indies.

176
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,630
Oh no.

177
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,970
Okay, please not be so long.

178
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,730
I'm so tired.

179
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,570
I'm also indie.

180
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,970
This is my showcase, you guys.

181
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,550
Beep boop bop, beep beep boop.

182
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,990
Beep beep boop, beep boop.

183
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,830
Oh, can you guys...

184
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,270
Oh, sorry.

185
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,070
I just realized I shrugged the screen.

186
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:34,690
Sorry, guys.

187
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,630
Sorry.

188
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,370
I'm Amber.

189
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,810
And I'm Andrew.

190
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,310
We're back with more indie games headed to the Nintendo Switch system.

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,390
All right.

192
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,790
It's time to lay our cards on the table.

193
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,490
Sure thing.

194
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,510
Can you guys hear it?

195
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,790
Why is there a joker in my hand?

196
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,490
Here's the deal.

197
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,190
Wait.

198
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,030
Blackjack?

199
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,790
Black hole.

200
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,910
Close enough.

201
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,790
Hahaha.

202
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,730
I hate portals.

203
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,270
Oh.

204
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,390
Oh, no.

205
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,470
Not the Baltaro.

206
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,750
Bal...

207
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,290
Bal...

208
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,250
Bal...

209
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,390
Bal...

210
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,330
Baldi's Basics?

211
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,250
Bal...

212
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,910
Balotrol.

213
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,730
Bal...

214
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,210
Balbo.

215
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,410
Wait.

216
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,290
With vampire survivors?

217
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,470
Yo.

218
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,830
Everything is vampire survivors.

219
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,410
Wow.

220
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:25,770
Wow.

221
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,350
Oh, my God.

222
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,900
The cards.

223
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,500
With the banana.

224
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,840
This is too much, man.

225
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
Make it end.

226
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,050
What was the first one?

227
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,030
I didn't catch it.

228
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,570
It was something in the vampire survivors.

229
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,710
What was the first one?

230
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,070
Oh.

231
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,390
So, no.

232
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,870
That's choreography.

233
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,150
I know.

234
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,670
It was a joke.

235
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,330
Oh, Witcher.

236
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,150
Okay, thank you.

237
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,670
That means we can have...

238
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,050
We can have a ball of...

239
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,330
A Bolognese with crossover Metal Gear.

240
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,370
It can happen, you guys.

241
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,430
That way I'll play the game.

242
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,150
Hahaha.

243
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,610
Hahaha.

244
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:29,650
Hahaha.

245
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:29,730
Hahaha.

246
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,430
Hahaha.

247
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,610
Hahaha.

248
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,950
Hahaha.

249
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,050
Hahaha.

250
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,450
Hahaha.

251
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,850
Hahaha.

252
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,490
Hahaha.

253
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,050
I was...

254
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,350
A game called...

255
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,590
Ball.

256
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,390
Steel ball run.

257
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,790
Steel...

258
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,570
Oh.

259
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,030
Balotrol.

260
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,950
Thanks, guys.

261
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,590
Thank you.

262
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,650
Oh.

263
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:03,550
Wow.

264
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,570
Wait.

265
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,450
We've seen this before, right?

266
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,070
I remember that scene with the wolf in the beginning and stuff.

267
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,110
I feel like we saw this before.

268
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,490
Or not the wolf, whatever that... yeah, that thing.

269
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,690
The dog.

270
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,070
It looks really nice, though.

271
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
October 15th!

272
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,180
Oh, that's recent.

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,620
Never.

274
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,260
Never.

275
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,780
It looks so good.

276
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,800
This is like everything I hate.

277
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,680
My office job, Matara-Kan.

278
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,580
Why is it Undertale all of a sudden?

279
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,140
I like the butterflies.

280
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,440
Cute.

281
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
Moths?

282
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,280
What is going on?

283
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
What?

284
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,380
Moths.

285
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,920
The moth was watching Naruto!

286
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
Moth-suto.

287
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,040
Hello.

288
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,100
Hi.

289
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Why are the other people frozen?

290
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,520
Free them!

291
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,380
Is this not a Zoom call?

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,020
Oh, God.

293
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm Amanda Winterstein, a game designer and a writer.

294
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,440
There are OLPTSD kicking in.

295
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,480
As soon as they said climb up the corporate ladder, I'm just like, oh.

296
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,620
A writer and an English to Japanese games translator.

297
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,280
I had the privilege to work on the Japanese translations of both Coffee Talk games.

298
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,820
Today, we are thrilled to announce that we are partnering with Chorus to expand the Coffee Talk world.

299
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:33,000
We've been hard at work over the last year to come up with a story that retains the cozy elements Coffee Talk 5 has.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,080
You thought I was a game dev, but I'm Dio.

301
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,400
Zawardo!

302
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,300
And now, we're very proud to announce an exciting new game for Coffee Talk fans.

303
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,800
Coffee Talk Tokyo!

304
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,480
Oh!

305
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,880
Coffee Talk Tokyo?

306
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,640
Oh...

307
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,130
Oh...

308
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,970
Oh...

309
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,690
Oh...

310
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,570
This...

311
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,370
Oh, no.

312
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:02,690
Oh...

313
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,410
The music is so good.

314
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,650
Oh, my God.

315
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,970
What the hell is this weeb?

316
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,870
Oh, my God.

317
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,910
No, I'm gonna have to play this.

318
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,670
Oh, my gosh.

319
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,110
You can...

320
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,090
Oh, my God.

321
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,470
What?

322
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,140
Oh, my God.

323
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,120
It feels so good.

324
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,680
I would put on...

325
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:47,820
When I was in my last hotel, I would put on, like, lo-fi and jazz and just stare out the window while sipping on coffee in the night.

326
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
I felt like royalty, you guys.

327
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,040
I was like, I've never stayed in such a fancy hotel.

328
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,440
Sakana has, like, insane expensive taste.

329
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:58,780
Oh!

330
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,440
Hendry!

331
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
You're looking a little hen-dry, though.

332
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,120
What kind of name is that?

333
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,020
Let's check out some upcoming downloadable content that will take you to new and unexpected places.

334
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,100
So aesthetic, Minto.

335
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,580
Oh.

336
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,980
Discover a miniature clockwork world in the Sea of Stars Throes of the Watchmaker DLC.

337
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,280
Gear up for a journey full of oddities and wonders in which Valir and Xael will have to play by new rules to put a stop to a cursed carnival.

338
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, I like carnival.

339
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,780
Xael will transform into a skillful juggler.

340
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,600
This feels very...

341
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,720
While Valir will dazzle as an acrobat.

342
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,100
Like Square Enix games and all.

343
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:49,940
Together with new playable character Arty, they'll explore new areas and battle through dangerous dungeons in their quest to save the world of Orlige.

344
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,140
A malevolent spectacle awaits when this free DLC for Sea of Stars launches on Nintendo Switch next spring.

345
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,620
It's inspired by Chrono Trigger.

346
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,800
I see it, I see it, I see it.

348
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,080
Hey!

349
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,720
Get out of my swamp!

350
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,860
Shrek?

351
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,260
Sorry, Ember.

352
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,900
No.

353
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,080
This swamp has layers of dirt.

354
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,640
Shut up.

355
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,240
The Direct was worth it.

356
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,980
Fine.

357
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm over it anyway.

358
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,960
A muddy good time awaits in the Shrek Special Pack paid DLC for Power Watch Simulator.

359
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,700
Oh, the Direct was so worth.

360
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:31,880
Fear is all-star as you wash away the grime covering five fairy tale maps from the Shrek universe, including Shrek's very own swamp and the Dragon's Lair.

361
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,660
Oh my god.

362
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:32,820
Oh my god.

363
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,760
With the suit of armor!

364
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,760
With the suit of armor!

365
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:43,260
And get your power-washing game on when the Shrek Special Pack DLC makes a splash on the Nintendo Switch system this fall.

366
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,100
Hi, I'm Sam.

367
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,860
And I'm Toby.

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,320
Our team has been working on a new game called Morsels.

369
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,260
Morsels?

370
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,560
He plays a mouse fighting against the forces of wicked cats.

371
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,280
I don't like that.

372
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,980
Using magical cards to transform into a bunch of weird little monsters.

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,580
Some funny ones.

374
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,000
Tell me.

375
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,560
Can we get like a lo-fi version of that song?

376
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,620
And then like a...

377
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,800
The cat is a monster!

378
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,140
There's a cat in the background!

379
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,080
Oh my gosh!

380
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,760
Sweet baby!

381
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,300
Oh my god!

382
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,800
Hello!

383
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
I want to pet him.

384
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,040
It's my cat!

385
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,540
Please enjoy the first-ever trailer for our strange little game.

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,020
I like strange little games.

387
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,600
Oh, I miss my cat so much.

388
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,600
Oh gosh.

389
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,410
That's a mouse?

390
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,390
Oh!

391
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,110
Oh!

392
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,530
Oh cute.

393
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,330
Oh god.

394
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,010
The mouse is feeling things.

395
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,030
The mouse became... a chicken?

396
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,830
What the hell is this?

397
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,990
Oh.

398
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,410
Where's the cats?

399
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,190
They said that there were cats in this game!

400
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,090
Oh my god.

401
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,690
You can...

402
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,710
Oh!

403
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,330
Matara!

404
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,550
Matara!

405
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,470
Oh!

406
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,770
She's in every game apparently.

407
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,490
Oh!

408
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,770
Winsil is butchering.

409
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,110
They're like Pokemon.

410
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,710
What is happening?

411
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,050
Oh!

412
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,610
You should have played FNAF Into the Pit.

413
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,010
You'd be a genius at that game then.

414
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,250
Whoa!

415
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,110
Why is...

416
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,050
What is...

417
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,330
What is happening?

418
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,330
This game is an absolute fever dream.

419
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,270
Why?

420
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,550
It's so gross.

421
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,550
Oh my god.

422
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:42,890
Wow.

423
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,370
I'm gonna cry.

424
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,630
Oh my god.

425
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,350
Oh my god.

426
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:50,850
Oh my gosh.

427
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,890
That was...

428
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,050
That was a weird little game.

429
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,890
You're right.

430
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,390
Oh!

431
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,670
Oh!

432
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,110
Ooh.

433
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,770
Oh I thought this was a honey pot.

434
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,910
That's right.

435
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:09,490
Household objects, appliances, and even concepts turn into eligible love interests in Date Everything.

436
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,310
What?

437
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,690
What?

438
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:10,990
Yes it is.

439
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:37,130
Oh my god, this game is so quirky!

440
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,670
What is happening?

441
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,170
Why are they all... Why are they all wearing short shorts?

442
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,170
Textbox-chan!

443
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,790
You can date the dialogue box!

444
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,050
This game is quirky quirky.

445
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,070
Oh, they're all voiced too!

446
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,730
I'm not dating my cat!

447
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,450
Oh, he's a clock.

448
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,210
Okay, nevermind.

449
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,690
Find the object of your affection when Date Everything launches on Nintendo Switch October 24th.

450
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,150
Date Everything.

451
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,170
I like the idea.

452
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,810
I like the idea of it, I think.

453
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,170
Hi, I'm Sienna, the lead artist on Peglin.

454
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,050
And I'm Dylan, the game designer of Peglin and the founder of Unnexious Games.

455
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,870
It's very quirky.

456
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,190
The two of us created the first version of Peglin at a game jam in 2019.

457
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,750
The theme of the jam was fall, and we wanted to create something fun and physics-y.

458
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,730
We ended up creating the first version of Peglin's battle system.

459
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,790
When the pandemic started, working on Peglin became a fun and creative escape.

460
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,470
We made cute places and enemies for our little goblin friends to explore.

461
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,650
We then added two of our friends to help speed up development.

462
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,050
And now four years later, we're a team of seven, and we're excited to bring Peglin to Nintendo Switch.

463
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,590
Peglin.

464
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,730
Peglin.

465
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,890
The dragons have been stealing your gold for as long as you can remember.

466
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,710
It's time to delve into the heart of their lair and exact your revenge with the power of Peg.

467
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:13,190
In this roguelike Pachito-inspired RPG, you'll aim orbs and hit pegs to deal damage in turn-based battles.

468
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,350
The more pegs you hit, the more devastating the blow you'll deal to your enemies.

469
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,270
Balance your way to victory with a variety of different orbs.

470
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,010
Some can split into multiple copies.

471
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,770
Others will pierce both pegs and enemies.

472
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,850
And some will even heal you for every peg you hit.

473
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:32,610
Hey.

474
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,290
I have to... wait, I have to peg to... to fight?

475
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,070
Interesting.

476
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,830
Oh, I want to play Peggle so bad right now.

477
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,090
It didn't even hit him!

478
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,250
He's too small to throw those bombs.

479
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,510
Hey, kids.

480
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,790
Thanks so much for the five gifted.

481
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,270
Thank you.

482
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,530
This is already out?

483
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,630
Yeah, they said that I was getting poured in.

484
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,950
Each run presents new opportunities for possible combinations.

485
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,170
It looks so fun, though.

486
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:03,910
I've never heard of it.

487
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,270
...when Peglin bounces onto Nintendo Switch as a timed console exclusive later today.

488
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,670
Oh!

489
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,990
Oh, timed console exclusive?

490
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,990
What do you mean by that?

491
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,830
Oh, not this shit.

492
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,650
No, no, no, no, not the wobbly island.

493
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,190
No!

494
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,670
Get a job!

495
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:28,970
Get a job!

496
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,250
Get a job!

497
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:30,630
Buy a house?

498
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,270
Oh, my gosh.

499
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,170
I don't think I played this game correctly when I played it, because I'm...

500
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,090
What do you mean?

501
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,090
What is all of this?

502
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,430
I've never seen any of this in my afterlife.

503
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,250
Wobbly life!

504
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,610
Wobbly life!

505
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,250
Wait, wait, wait!

506
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,310
Even the...

507
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,650
Even the narrators are arguing.

508
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,430
Everybody is...

509
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,970
This is...

510
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,630
Even the...

511
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,050
Even the MCs are arguing together.

512
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,750
Oh my gosh.

513
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,070
No, Pico Park 2!

514
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,530
Pico Park 2!

515
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,190
I thought it was gonna be TLC or something.

516
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,770
Oh my god, no.

517
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,930
No, that's me!

518
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,970
Oh my god.

519
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,730
Feels like this would be a good game for you, Doki and Matata.

520
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,610
Yeah, friendships will be put to the test!

521
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,130
Today!

522
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,030
Oh my god.

523
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,570
This is what...

524
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,030
This is what we...

525
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,730
We lost...

526
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,390
We lost Tomodachi life to this.

527
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,910
Oh, Shovel Knight.

528
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,950
Woah!

529
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,370
Woah!

530
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,410
Europe?

531
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,630
Wait, did they say all this was releasing today?

532
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,630
Wow.

533
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,170
I haven't played that, but I always thought it looked so cute.

534
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,140
I haven't played that, but I always thought it looked so cute.

535
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,420
Damn.

536
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Woah!

537
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,140
Okay.

538
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,600
What's going on here?

539
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,440
Metal Slug Tactics.

540
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh, it said available fall 2024.

541
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,380
Okay, so not everything is available today.

542
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,920
I think I'm just...

543
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,100
I think I'm just...

544
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,800
What is this?

545
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh wait, no, I've heard... I remember this actually.

546
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do remember.

547
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:37,800
I remember.

548
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,020
This game.

549
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,380
Sorry, I keep yawning.

550
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,180
Oh my gosh.

551
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,580
That's all for today's show...

552
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,380
Hey, where'd you get that pizza?

553
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,320
I found it in that tower over there.

554
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,260
Pizza Tower!

555
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
Pizza Tower!

556
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,520
Pizza Tower!

557
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Pizza Mansion.

558
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,040
Pizza Mansion.

559
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,260
I've been wanting to play this actually.

560
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,520
Should've just put it on my schedule.

561
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,580
Pizza!

562
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,660
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.

563
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,490
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.

564
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:41,570
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.

565
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,150
Pizza, pizza!

566
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,430
Scary pizza!

567
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,330
This game looks so awesome.

568
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,550
Mouse!

569
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,210
Mouse!

570
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh my god.

571
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,560
It just like scratches a good itch, you know?

572
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,360
Yay!

573
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,420
Nice.

574
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,820
Live pizza reaction.

575
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,480
That's all for today's Indie World!

576
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,420
Okay, Indies!

577
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,220
We hope you enjoyed today's showcase!

578
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,620

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,400
Time for the showcase!

584
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,420

Thank you!

587
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,960
Alright guys, Silksong...

588
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,200
They would save it for the end, you think?

589
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,080
They would save it for the end!

590
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,940
They would save it for the end, right?

591
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,880
They would save it for the end, probably.

592
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,000
Hello everyone!

593
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,120
Welcome to today's Nintendo Direct Partners Showcase!

594
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,400
Partners Showcase!

595
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,330
In this presentation, we'll be focusing on Nintendo Switch games launching in the second half of 2024...

596
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
Nerdy laundry!

597
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,680
Thanks for the five gifters!

598
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,740
Okay, let's get into the headlines!

599
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,620
Nintendo...

600
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,020
Nintendo...

601
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,140
These games are falling into place!

602
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,060
Tetris...

603
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:43,790
That's my daughter, Krishna.

604
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,690
She's such an old schoolgirl!

605
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:48,910
But...

606
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,590
I want to villager!

607
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,470
I want a villager!!

608
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,490
There's a world of weak-willed girls inside my micro dress...

609
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,010
We need to find a way to bring them down.

610
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,910
That's what I gotta do!

611
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,110
Wow!

612
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,030
There's a lot.

613
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,870
What's that?

614
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,330
Oh, cool!

615
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,630
Oh my gosh!

616
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,230
That looks really fun.

617
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,790
If I were good at Tetris, I'd be like, yeah!

618
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,870
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

619
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,610
Follow the watch.

620
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:28,890
Stop!

621
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,370
A new version of Tetris is coming to Nintendo Switch Online this winter.

622
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,530
And be on the lookout for a Tetris 99 Maximus Cup event.

623
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,330
Also coming this winter.

624
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,370
Tetris 99.

625
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,950
Speed into the unknown.

626
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,570
That's what I say to my cat.

627
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,970
When I'm trying to make him tired, I'll be like, your eyelids are getting heavy.

628
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,510
You're getting sleepy.

629
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,210
You want to go to dreamland.

630
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,310
You'll venture through a massive alien world to reunite with your beloved.

631
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,650
My beloved?

632
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,050
Ride the stylish hoverboard to explore stunning landscapes filled with all sorts of alien structures.

633
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:17,270
From scorching sands to wavy waters, each area will challenge your traversal skills.

634
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,570
Along the way, you'll face enemies in frenetic melee combat.

635
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:28,830
By unlocking skills and combining different abilities, you can find more creative ways to overcome foes.

636
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,790
You can also customize the hoverboard to match your riding style.

637
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,630
Solve puzzles and gather resources to boost its speed, steering, gravity, and more.

638
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,810
Whether you're racing through terrain at high speeds or in the thrones of combat.

639
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,490
The hoverboard will be there to help you.

640
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,450
Weep no stone unturned.

641
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,430
As you explore every corner of this vast planet.

642
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,010
You never know what or who you'll find.

643
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,590
Star overdrive.

644
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,150
Launches as a timed exclusive on Nintendo Switch next year.

645
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,230
Do whatever floats your goat.

646
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,870
Welcome to the vast island of San Angora.

647
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,530
Where you'll tip on the world.

648
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,790
A goat.

649
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,690
You're not kidding.

650
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:23,750
In this sprawling sandbox adventure, you'll headbutt, lick, and explode your way across the island.

651
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,730
Reek havoc on anything and everything you find.

652
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,290
You'll drift around town, join a yoga class, antagonize the locals.

653
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,350
You can do all of that and more.

654
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,370
Complete quests and gain karma to progress the story and unlock customization options.

655
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:36,850
Karma...?

656
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,570
What is ha-?

657
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,150
Wait... what?

658
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,790
There's a story and goat simulator?

659
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,970
From fashionable nonsense, like floral shirts and inflatable tubes...

660
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,210
to goat variants.

661
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,010
That's not a goat.

662
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,910
Oh sorry it is.

663
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,630
I'm so sorry it said Angry Goat.

664
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,110
I'm so sorry.

665
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,310
Thought it was a goat...

666
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,850
And you're not the only belligerent billy around here.

667
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,030
Unleash all sorts of things.

668
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,650
Goat!

669
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,570
Goat!

670
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,310
Goat!

671
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,310
Oh, I can't wait to play with Goat!

672
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:01,810
Oh, Goat!

673
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,310
Oh no!

674
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,390
Today!

675
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,190
Oh my gosh!

676
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,850
Nice!

677
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,050
Physical Goat!

678
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,810
Game updates?

679
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,230
Game updates?

680
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,930
Game updates?

681
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,860
Star Wars!

682
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,930
Call of Duty Stalker!

683
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,270
Just kidding.

684
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,170
Worms!

685
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,510
Worms?

686
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,670
Worms?

687
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,970
Oh no!

688
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,310
Disney game!

689
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,030
Oh my god!

690
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,490
Jack Skellington is right there!

691
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,510
Make Bikini Bottom your playground!

692
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,930
What is?

693
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,130
What?

694
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,270
Oh my gosh!

695
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:25,850
Patrick!

696
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,930
Is this SpongeBob?

697
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,890
No, this is Patrick!

698
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,310
This is Patrick!

699
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,270
The silly sea star from SpongeBob SquarePants stars in this...

700
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,030
Wait, actually!

701
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,950
Sandbox adventure!

702
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,370
It's a sandbox!

703
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,050
Bikini Bottom is your oyster!

704
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,770
Why?

705
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,330
Make some hilarious mayhem by performing whimsical skydives...

706
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,330
Whim?

707
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,190
Oh my gosh!

708
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,370
Digging up treasure in the dump...

709
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,030
Or even blowing off steam in Mrs. Puff's Rage Room!

710
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,770
Oh, that... I was about to say that looks like a Rage Game area.

711
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,530
...to paint tubes...

712
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,270
...to make the world more Patrick-y.

713
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,050
I love Splatoon!

714
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,450
And he's not the only familiar face here.

715
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:03,690
What?

716
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,770
Okay, where's SpongeBob?

717
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,130
Oh, there he is.

718
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,190
Sandy, Squidward, and more.

719
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:10,750
Hey,

720
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,730
you turned off the lights!

721
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,370
Step into Patrick's shorts and the inner machinations of his mind.

722
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,270
We're taking off Patrick's shorts?

723
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,910
When SpongeBob SquarePants, the Patrick Star game, launches on Nintendo Switch...

724
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,330
What's happening?

725
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,830
...October 4th.

726
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,330
Pre-orders begin later today on Nintendo Wii Shop.

727
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,610
Who all is pre-ordering the hashtag Patrick Star game?

728
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,130
Ready for your very own personal trainer?

729
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,530
Okay, let's get started.

730
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,450
Hatsune Miku!

731
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:39,810
Ready?

732
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,510
One, two, jump!

733
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,650
The latest entry in the fitness boxing series is punching its way onto Nintendo Switch.

734
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,030
My personal trainer?

735
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,030
Oh!

736
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,830
Newly added features make it easier to train more regularly.

737
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,670
I can't wait for the art of them.

738
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,370
Choose Quick Workout...

739
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,310
...to jump into an exercise program right after launching the game.

740
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,190
Bring back...

741
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,510
Bring back the Wii Fitness lady.

742
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,790
Let her be an extra character.

743
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,390
Come on.

744
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,110

926
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,770
Getting high scores by playing nostalgic arcade minigames.

927
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,450
I don't think we'll ever be free of Five Nights at Freddy's you guys.

928
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,250
I don't think we'll ever be free of FNAF.

929
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:42,250
But you'll be doing all of this while avoiding animatronic atrocities along the way.

930
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,010
Music man.

931
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,830
Become a Fazbear entertainment superstar.

932
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,650
In Five Nights at Freddy's help one and two.

933
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,210
This music is literally penis music.

934
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,210
It's taking me out.

935
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,610
If you're looking for more adventures in the mega pizza flex.

936
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:08,870
Find your friend and escape the ruins in this free story DLC for Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach launching on Nintendo Switch this holiday.

937
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,010
It's pee pee music.

938
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:12,890
You guys never heard of that?

939
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,070
Let's check out some Nintendo Switch games launching in time for the holidays.

940
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:16,830
Just look it up.

941
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,650
I promise.

942
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,490
I promise it's a real thing.

943
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,810
Just Dance.

944
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,170
Lego.

945
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,750
Mickey Mouse.

946
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:28,370
Mickey Mouse.

947
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,130
The mouse is loose.

948
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,810
I know I would have eaten that up as a kid though.

949
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,730
Oh this is that Hobbit game.

950
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:39,330
Yeah.

951
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,630
I remember when they introduced this too.

952
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,890
Yeah.

953
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,230
Just Dance.

954
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,230
Those are real people.

955
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,430
That drives me insane.

956
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,250
Those aren't like they actually dress them up.

957
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,930
Funko fusion?

958
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,630
Oh that's that one Funko game that they did before too.

959
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:04,970
Yeah.

960
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,070
I do remember that now.

961
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:08,810
Oh gosh.

962
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,530
Funko pops are indie you guys.

963
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,290
Oh wait sorry.

964
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,190
This is the partner showcase.

965
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:16,730
Just kidding.

966
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:18,710
I forgot.

967
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:19,290
I forgot.

968
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,790
Just kidding.

969
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,110
Lego Horizon.

970
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,110
This isn't new either.

971
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,940
Anime.

972
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,160
I should ask the same of you.

973
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,570
Hi.

974
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,630
Aaaaahhhh.

975
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,850
Welcome to the eastern nation of Azuma.

976
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,150
After a calamity struck What's this?

977
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,070
Oh.

978
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,190
Rune Factory.

979
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:11,830
The only thing I know about Rune Factory is when you have Rune Factory 4 on your 3DS and you know when you hover over it and it makes like a sound.

980
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,710
She goes Rune Factory 4!

981
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,470
That's the only thing I know about Rune Factory.

982
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,390
Literally that specific thing.

983
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,750
Rune Factory 4!

984
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,370
I'm gonna do that.

985
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,870
Oh yeah, I'm gonna mine.

986
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,050
Gosh, leave me alone.

987
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,090
I just wanna be...

988
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,410
Why are you attacking those little small guys?

989
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,070
They're so cute!

990
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,550
Don't hurt the frogs!

991
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,690
Who is that?

992
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,310
Who is she?

993
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,330
Who is she?

994
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,430
Shut up.

995
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,210
Who is she?

996
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,190
Oh my god, I got lightheaded.

997
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,970
Who is she?

998
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,190
Who is she?

999
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,050
Who is she?

1000
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,790
Oh.

1001
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,530
Wait, this is the last announcement!

1002
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,410
Wait, I can't look!

1003
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,290
Spoilers!

1004
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:57,830
I can't look!

1005
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,630
I can't look!

1006
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,450
Can't look.

1007
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,490
Yakuza on Switch?

1008
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,070
I can't look.

1009
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:12,970
Oh.

1010
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,790
I can't look.

1011
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,010
I can't look.

1012
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:18,490
Can't look?

1013
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,250
Street ruffians.

1014
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:19,410
Street ruffians.

1015
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:30,190
I was hoping that the last announcement would be like a new game, you know?

1016
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,370
Not like a port to the Switch.

1017
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,450
But, you know.

1018
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,170
So take a break from brawling every once in a while.

1019
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:37,430
Oh!

1020
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,150
Pretty cool!

1021
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,710
Yakuza Kiwami!

1022
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,530
That's interesting.

1023
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,850
Wait, are the other Yakuza games on the Switch?

1024
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:58,890
No?

1025
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,810
It's so interesting that they're starting with Kiwami though.

1026
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,010
My Yakuza brain rot is going wild.

1027
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,430
I just screamed in the middle of work.

1028
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,490
Oh, Kiwami is the first one?

1029
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,110
Oh!

1030
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,150
Okay, sorry.

1031
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,090
I thought it was... not the first one.

1032
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,130
Okay, just kidding then.

1033
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,110
I'm silly.

1034
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,390
I was thinking of... Oh, I was thinking of Zero.

1035
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,050
That's why.

1036
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,550
I was thinking of Zero.

1037
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,550
Yay!

1038
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,050
Yay!

1039
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,010
Thank you for watching!

1040
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,470
Yay!

1041
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,390
I'm gonna go to sleep, you guys.

1042
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,170
What am I playing tomorrow?

1043
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,830
Um...

1044
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,670
Oh!

1045
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:57,490
Unmetal.

1046
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,530
That was fun.

1047
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:01,930
Um...

1048
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,150
No Silksong.

1049
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:04,410
Sorry guys.

1050
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,110
Sorry everybody.

1051
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:07,810
Um...

1052
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,230
Sorry for your loss.

1053
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:13,890
Um...

1054
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:15,230
Um...

1055
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,690
Good night, Minta.

1056
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:16,870
Good night, everybody.

1057
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:19,810
Um...

1058
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,510
Silksong next year, Copium.

1059
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:25,970
I'll be there right next to you with my Tomodachi Life 2, baby!

1060
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:32,610
No matter what kind of direct it is, I'll be labeling it as Tomodachi Life 2, please!

1061
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,430
Yes, yes, yes!

1062
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,850
Yup, yup, yup!

1063
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,030
That's what I'll do!

1064
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,110
Verily, thank you so much!

1065
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,070
Thanks for the watch-along.

1066
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,630
Will you be streaming the Power Wash Shrek DLC Day 1?

1067
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:42,690
Um...

1068
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,010
When did it say that it comes out?

1069
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,810
Wait, hold on.

1070
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,070
Shrek...

1071
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:48,750
DLC...

1072
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,070
Power Wash...

1073
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,010
Oh...

1074
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,470
When does it come out?

1075
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,550
Did it say?

1076
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,050
Did it say?

1077
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,050
Shrek DLC...

1078
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,390
Ah!

1079
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,990
You must have missed it!

1080
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,530
I only made it to your streams because I just got it from work.

1081
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,350
So what did I miss?

1082
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,850
You missed everything.

1083
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,710
Eternal Darkness meant, don't forget.

1084
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,910
Eternal Darkness...

1085
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:17,530
I'm not home!

1086
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,830
I can't play Eternal Darkness!

1087
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,010
I do not have...

1088
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,230
I do not have my PlayStation with me.

1089
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,870
I am on a laptop.

1090
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,650
I think you need to check your sanity meter.

1091
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,090
Then go home.

1092
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:41,530
Oh, okay.

1093
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,650
Atelier Yumiya looks fun.

1094
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,890
I could play Yakuza tomorrow.

1095
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,470
I could.

1096
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,470
Because I have my Switch.

1097
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,930
Anything that was like...

1098
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,770
Anything that was announced for the Switch now, I could play.

1099
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,470
Because I brought my Switch.

1100
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,450
I could stream anything on the Switch.

1101
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,730
But no, I'm not gonna do Yakuza just yet.

1102
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:14,850
Sorry guys.

1103
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,910
Hold out for Ace Combat.

1104
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,810
Hold out for Yakuza.

1105
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,410
Eventually.

1106
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,830
I will stream them.

1107
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,510
Don't worry.

1108
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,570
What's a Balatroin?

1109
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,490
Is it Poker?

1110
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,690
How do you play it?

1111
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,190
Because I'm not good at Poker.

1112
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,540
Poker is a roguelike.

1113
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,520
That sounds so scary.

1114
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,020
It's Poker but fun.

1115
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,120
It's not Poker.

1116
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,380
Roguelike Poker game.

1117
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,900
I really like Blackjack.

1118
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,260
I'm good at that game.

1119
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:04,840
All I ask is for the next console's gimmick is to have a mic so we can play DS games like Fossil Fighter.

1120
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,740
What's that?

1121
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,860
I want a mic so that we can play games like...

1122
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,480
The ones where you have to dub...

1123
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,400
What was it?

1124
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:17,960
WarioWare?

1125
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,800
Stuff like that.

1126
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:24,320
Where we have to blow into the mic to do stuff.

1127
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,940
That kind of gimmick is so fun.

1128
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,880
You don't actually have to know much about Poker.

1129
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,160
It's basically Poker 2.

1130
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,080
Roguelike Boogaloo.

1131
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:34,580
Oh.

1132
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,030
Ace Combat just finished the final edition on AC4.

1133
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,680
With S rank.

1134
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,760
Like Ace Attorney just to yell objection.

1135
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,360
Yes!

1136
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,120
Yes, just to yell objection!

1137
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,340
Oh my gosh, I forgot you could use to do that.

1138
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,260
What is Fossil Fighter?

1139
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,840
Oh, sorry.

1140
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,780
That was my mic.

1141
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,380
Fossil Fighter.

1142
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,640
We are...

1143
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,900
I do know this game.

1144
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:02,760
Yes, yes.

1145
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,920
I do know this game.

1146
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,500
Sorry, it's hard for me to think of anything right now.

1147
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,620
I thought you were insulting me.

1148
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,580
I thought you were like, we are...

1149
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,120
Calling me a Fossil Fighter.

1150
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,360
Keep fighting, Minto.

1151
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,160
You Fossil Fighter.

1152
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,520
JP Direct has...

1153
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,680
Tokimeki Memorial...

1154
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,040
Wait, what?

1155
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,680
Wait.

1156
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1157
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1158
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:30,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1159
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,700
Hold on.

1160
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,480
Hold.

1161
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,520
Tokimek...

1162
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,220
Tokimemo Remake?

1163
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:36,860
Hold on.

1164
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,740
Hold on.

1165
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,100
No way.

1166
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,320
No way.

1167
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,420
Where is the Nihongo version?

1168
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,980
Hold on.

1169
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,500
Hold on.

1170
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,540
One moment, please.

1171
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,160
One moment, please.

1172
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,520
I need to stream to it.

1173
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,360
Oh, here we go.

1174
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,650
I'm looking for...

1175
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,450
Pico Park 2.

1176
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,410
I can't believe we're getting Pico Park 2.

1177
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:23,170
I cannot believe we're getting Pico Park 2.

1178
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,050
I can't believe this is happening.

1179
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,210
Oh, wow.

1180
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,990
They actually ended it on Rune Factory instead of Yakuza.

1181
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,530
That's so interesting.

1182
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,410
Hold on.

1183
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:37,310
I'm looking for it.

1184
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,210
Hold on.

1185
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:42,570
You know what?

1186
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,170
Let's just...

1187
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:43,490
Here.

1188
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,930
Let me just put it up on the screen real quick.

1189
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:46,730
Yeah.

1190
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,910
One moment.

1191
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,830
This is the Japanese Nintendo Direct.

1192
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,570
For those wondering.

1193
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,830
For those doing timestamps and such.

1194
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,890
Of the works.

1195
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,350
Okay.

1196
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,130
Give me a moment to shrink.

1197
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:14,850
Okay.

1198
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,150
Let's just...

1199
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,870
I'm not going to watch the whole thing, obviously.

1200
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,650
I'm just going to kind of...

1201
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,010
Sift through it a little bit.

1202
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,390
Okay.

1203
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,730
So, let's turn off the music.

1204
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:30,130
Because they showed us a few things in here as well.

1205
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,730
Like, you could see...

1206
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,690
The...

1207
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,270
This...

1208
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,450
The game...

1209
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,530
The game...

1210
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:37,910
The...

1211
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:38,470
The...

1212
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,030
Eight game.

1213
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,950
Do not move when it is bright.

1214
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:43,310
Wait.

1215
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:43,850
Actually...

1216
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,350
Oh.

1217
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:47,750
Sorry.

1218
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:48,630
Oh.

1219
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:49,570
Oh my god.

1220
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,270
I got jump scared by a child.

1221
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,690
Platform 8.

1222
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:55,670
Wait.

1223
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:55,890
No.

1224
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:57,170
I don't think I played this one.

1225
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,470
I don't remember that.

1226
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,710
Do I play?

1227
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,870
I don't know.

1228
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,410
You scared me.

1229
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:04,790
I'm sorry.

1230
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,370
Do not...

1231
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:06,670
Oh.

1232
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,430
Oh.

1233
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:12,850
This is scary.

1234
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,330
Oh.

1235
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,910
Noriba 8.

1236
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,250
No.

1237
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:18,630
Oh.

1238
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:21,710
He's supporting a child.

1239
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:24,750
Oops.

1240
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:25,830
I was just thinking.

1241
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,290
Oh.

1242
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:33,030
Let's try playing the normal mijn game.

1243
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,930
Is recuerd in the chat room Yes.

1244
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:35,550
Wow.

1245
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:35,570
May be a tough task.

1246
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:35,790
What is it called?

1247
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,150
Toy defence, children's disposal, I've heard the name of it.

1248
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:36,810
Oh, yeah.

1249
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:37,150
I don't remember.

1250
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,730
Please don'tcheck it now.

1251
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,830
I've heard, but no tune that I can remember where.

1252
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,690
Good useless.

1253
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,230
That's cute, the puzzle game.

1254
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,390
What is this?

1255
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:13,870
I recognize that narrator voice.

1256
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,170
I'm not sure.

1257
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,150
Aw.

1258
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,350
Hashtag...

1259
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:27,670
Hashtag cool.

1260
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:30,310
Oh my goodness.

1261
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:37,590
See, these are the types of games that you have to play if you want to learn, if you want to get good at Japanese.

1262
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,350
Oh my god, it's all like their social media style.

1263
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,410
This is crazy.

1264
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:48,870
This is crazy.

1265
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,630
Holy moly.

1266
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,550
Okay, let's keep going.

1267
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,430
Oh, what's this?

1268
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:03,830
Pizza tower.

1269
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:08,730
No way!

1270
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,390
Wait, oh gosh, hold on, it's cut off on my screen.

1271
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:17,770
Oh.

1272
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:20,870
Ooh.

1273
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:28,170
See, why can't we get this?

1274
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,150
.

1275
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,090
I wanna play this!

1276
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,150
Why everything is about this SNS?

1277
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:40,350
Whoa!

1278
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:41,970
Scary!

1279
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,170
.

1280
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:55,130
I want to play this!

1281
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,850
Oh my gosh, stop.

1282
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:57,710
It's so cute.

1283
01:05:59,250 --> 01:05:59,770
Yurei!

1284
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,050
That's me!

1285
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:20,090
Wow, scary!

1286
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,450
This looks so awesome.

1287
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:29,910
I love Toshidensetsu.

1288
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,410
Aww.

1289
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:36,890
Interesting.

1290
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,050
Okay.

1291
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,110
I don't need to see Pico Park again, right?

1292
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:42,970
Let's see.

1293
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,510
This is...

1294
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,990
That... This is Disney game?

1295
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,670
Capcom game?

1296
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:50,570
What is this?

1297
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,590
Oh wait, is this the Wobbly World game?

1298
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,170
Oh, no.

1299
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,150
What the hell is this?

1300
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,490

Wait, no.

Why didn't you put the rhino head down?

1306
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:17,910
Oh, no!

1307
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:24,650

Oh my god, no.

01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,730
I need to play this.

1310
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,090
This is a VTuber game for sure.

1311
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,750
I will be... I will be partaking.

01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,730

Well, these...

1385
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,530
Why do people just want to work?

1386
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,850
Working simulators are so funny.

1387
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,950

It's midnight for me, you guys.

1391
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,610
So...

Now...

1393
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,610
I go to sleep.

1394
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,670
Tokimeki Roborio was worth waiting for though.

1395
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:46,470
It was worth seeing.

1396
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,270
Yeah.

1397
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,790
I could barely keep my eyes open though.

1398
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,870
Okay.

1399
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,010

1404
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,490
Hold on...

1405
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,870
To your...

1406
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:05,870
To your pantaloons.

1407
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,070
Maybe...

1408
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,010
Okey dokey.

1409
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,010
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1410
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:13,090
Ateminta.

Bye bye.

1414
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,630
Bye bye.

1415
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,870
Bye bye.

1416
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,850
Thank you.

1417
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,670
Have a good night or day or...

1418
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,010
Whatever time it is.

1419
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:28,570
Forever.

1420
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,490
Thanks for watching.

1421
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,270
