1
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,460
My voice might be a little overworked.

2
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,460
I haven't talked at all today.

3
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,960
Oh gosh.

4
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,150

preview or maybe you were there.

Great show, Minto.

18
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,350
Here's the $50 we would have spent on dinner.

19
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,110
What are you talking about?

20
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,670
The show...

21
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,330
It wasn't even on Valentine's Day.

22
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,590
Well, I guess everybody...

23
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,330
The team was up pretty late.

24
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,910
Packing up everything.

25
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,870
I was quite...

26
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,010
I mean, I'm already dead.

27
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,870
But I was quite...

28
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,830
Out of commission on Saturday.

29
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,110
I was like...

30
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,890
Moisture, no!

31
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,130
Okay, hold on.

32
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,410
I'm getting ahead of myself, right?

33
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,750
Okay, I'm in trouble.

34
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,430
Thank you!

35
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,150
Thank you so much!

36
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,430
Thank you so much, for the hug!

37
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,330
I'm so glad you're not!

38
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,930
So far, watching the stream live and seeing you and the rest
of the guests and fan kill it.

39
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,850
Thanks for giving us such a wonderful experience.

40
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,270
Thank you!

41
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,230
I...

42
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,030
No!

43
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,070
Oh my gosh.

44
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,090
I can't tell you guys how much anxiety I had going.

45
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,870
up into the live show.

46
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:31,110
I was asked by some friends, you know, they were like, you
know, what if you have a really good time?

47
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,990
And which I figured I would, right?

48
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,750
But they were like, what if you have a really good time?

49
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,710
And then, you know, that makes up for all the anxiety.

50
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,030
And I was like, I don't know.

51
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,690
I could have like the bestest ever, bestest, most stupendous
time ever.

52
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,090
But I don't think it...

53
00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:07,410
it uh qual it justifies how nervous i was because you know
with fantastic reality i i um i it was a live band right oh

54
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,950
my gosh dargo thank you thank you guys for all the
memberships and thank you for the super chats and everything

55
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,410
thank you concert was amazing i'm absolutely i was
absolutely

56
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,250
Mercurially, thank you!

57
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,930
He did really, really great.

58
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,050
Thank you so much.

59
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,110
Thank you.

60
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,590
Pressure makes diamonds, they say.

61
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,630
Man, you know, with Fantastic Reality, it was a live band as
well.

62
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,930
But it was not my show, you know?

63
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,910
It was not just me!

64
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,610
So it was really, really scary.

65
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,110
Diamond dogs?

66
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,090
Yeah.

67
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,090
Yeah, but I practiced a lot.

68
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,950
And another thing I was really nervous about is, like, with
jazz, especially, there's so many different renditions of

69
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,070
songs, right?

70
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,870
You know what I mean?

71
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,430
Thank me, thank you so much.

72
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,430
You, the guests in the live band, were amazing.

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,930
Congrats on the new Oni-san, too.

74
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,790
Thank you.

75
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,390
Thank you, thank you.

76
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,060
Thank you so much.

77
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,800
Thank you.

78
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,900
Hope you can take it easy for a little bit.

79
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,120
Oh, but that's okay.

80
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,820
That's okay, that's okay.

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,520
Uh.

82
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,380
What was I saying?

83
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:33,900
Um.

84
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,380
Oh, yeah, there's so many different versions of jazz songs.

85
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:45,080
So I was like, what if, what if, like, their version that
they've been learning and my version that I've been learning

86
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,840
don't exactly sync, you know what I mean?

87
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,800
And, um, actually, I did mention this in the second.

88
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:08,420
show but um we had like one hour to rehearse i only got to
go through the songs once so if there was anything that i

89
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:18,420
needed to remember to to there was one thing i forgot and
they talked to me after after the show on the first show and

90
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,540
i remembered for the second show but um yeah it

91
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:35,720
sure that was wild to learn in person yeah just just a
little bit of rehearsal practicing it was one and done the

92
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:46,260
band were they were such professionals so honestly because
of them i feel that um that is why it was really great

93
00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:00,140
uh and there were a couple things that i had to learn on the
spot so i was like oh it was it was something that i've

94
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:12,720
never done before for real so it was a crazy experience
never done in my afterlife ever the whole show was excellent

95
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,880
band was excellent y'all did an amazing job with those
really tight interval vocal harmonies thank you

96
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:29,260
the first take but it's a whole concert no we got me we got
to practice once

97
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,000
yeah so that was that was like i said you know just having
not

98
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:53,220
um having not able to practice so much and everything and it
was it was pressure but i'm glad that it ended up working

99
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,600
really Well, we were like, thank you so much for the hug, so
much!

100
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,020
This was lovely, and your new original song was fire!

101
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,520
Great job!

102
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,880
Thank you!

103
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm really so, so grateful that I got to do it.

104
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,260
I heard that the club was pretty packed.

105
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm so sorry if you were there, but I'm glad that we...

106
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:34,800
got to squeeze in and squeeze in as many people as we could
uh the box being revealed from the box i was like this is

107
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,300
the coolest thing ever i really loved that it was like kind
of a fake out you see the two screens on the side and you're

108
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:49,320
like maybe thinking oh minto will be on one of those screens
no i'm right there in the chocolate box in the middle so

109
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:59,940
cool if you guys know gate box like the It was, it's funny
because like there's this like Kickstarter thing for some AI

110
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,600
program or AI anime girl that's basically an old gate box.

111
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,140
Or new gate box.

112
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,920
But the old one was basically like a Google Home or like
Siri.

113
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,680
But it was an anime girl.

114
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,640
And I felt like that.

115
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
What's in the box?

116
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,180
No, we'll thank you.

117
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,140
Congrats, Minto!

118
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,000
The show is amazing!

119
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,320
Never could go to an IRL concert in this virtual was my
first one!

120
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,780
I said, love you all, and how being at home it felt like we
were hanging outside the club.

121
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
Thank you so much!

122
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,180
And so...

123
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,980
Did they have gatebox with Miku?

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,680
I don't know about Miku, but there are like...

125
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,580
There are like home gateboxes you can have now that you can
have like...

126
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,460
from Steinsgate.

127
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,060
You could even put, like, you can even put, like, your VR
Chata avatar in there, so it's pretty cool, actually.

128
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,100
The only question I have after seeing your concert is Jazz
Alba when...

129
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,120
I...

130
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't know.

131
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,900
I...

132
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,700
Um...

133
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,780
I, uh...

134
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,260
Uh...

135
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:35,200
you know, I picked my set list I tried to make it like a mix
of you know, there was only the one Japanese song in there

136
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:44,620
with Den Setsu which, oh, I guess that wasn't in the in the
preview but if you want to hear that of course the stream is

137
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:55,720
still up if you can get it or have a watch party with some
friends or something but then of course you know, I had a

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,860
fallout songs there too and Metal Gear, of course.

139
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,280
I think of Metal Gear.

140
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,260
I think Metal Gear was like so...

141
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,680
You know, singing Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday in a jazz
club with a live band.

142
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,880
It was so hard not to cry.

143
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
I was so happy.

144
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,940
It was so awesome.

145
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,940
I sound like...

146
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,060
I sound like, oh man.

147
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,860
Because I'm trying not to cry.

148
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,220
Oh, it's so awesome.

149
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,660
And snake eater?

150
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah, sorry, setless spoilers.

151
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,920
Goffle, thank you for the pair.

152
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,440
I love you, me.

153
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,560
Don't love you, Goffle.

154
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,480
Thank you.

155
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,380
You sound like a child singer.

156
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,020
I do?

157
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,600
I'll fake it until you make it, baby.

158
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,700
I don't know, I felt so silly in the dress.

159
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
I felt so silly in the dress.

160
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,580
I'm not going to lie.

161
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,520
I was like, Celis was perfect.

162
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,920
A mixture of classic jazz standards and unique picks that
felt very personal to you.

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,660
Exactly what the show needed.

164
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,300
Yeah, I thought a lot about what kind of songs I wanted to
sing.

165
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,420
Dress was perfect.

166
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,480
It looked great on me.

167
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,740
Thank you.

168
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,020

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:09,540
yeah yeah like i you know originally when this idea came
about it was like kind of levee right i was like i want to

173
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:19,580
sing a bunch of levee songs and a jazz club and i only in
the end sung one levee song but i really like that one it's

174
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:30,720
like one of my favorite songs by her and i tried to do like
a a mix of lovey songs and not so lovey songs too But

175
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,920
there's a lot...

176
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,840
Why does it feel like every jazz song is one or the other?

177
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,320
It's either a love song or not, right?

178
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
The band killed it.

179
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,100
Yeah, they did.

180
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,500
Jeff, thank you.

181
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,120
It's also funny seeing my big bald head in Aloha, I for
sure.

182
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,440
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm wrecked to know it stressed your voice more.

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Oh, no.

185
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,100
That's not what stressed my voice.

186
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,160
I went to Disney yesterday.

187
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,640
yesterday.

188
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,260
I went to Disney and I was screaming on the rise.

189
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:17,390
But the theme parks always, I feel like they ruined my voice
because they're so loud and I'm having to yell the whole

190
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,110
time.

191
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,190
I went to Disney.

192
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,130
Yeah, I bet that's exactly why my voice is like this.

193
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,510
Sorry.

194
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,310
I wish I could be like, oh yes, it was because I was working
so hard in my at the Mike Jazz Show.

195
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,170
No.

196
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,590
And you know what?

197
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,870
Oh my gosh.

198
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,610
Jazz version of Break Stuff.

199
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:56,150
Having the jazz version of Welcome to Mint Cafe was so...

200
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,170
It was so great, no.

201
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,530
If you haven't heard it.

202
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,590
But also, do you guys notice the BGM?

203
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,250
Wait, is it...

204
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,010
Can you even hear it?

205
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,690
Is it too quiet?

206
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:16,610
my new original song I can't sing it for you right now
because one my voice is like this but two you should go

207
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:29,090
watch the VOD so that you can hear it this is the original
song my new original song yet I'll be with you

208
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,450
composed by He'd be no sign of a snake eater fam.

209
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,470
Actually, I'd been wanting to work with him for so long,
obviously.

210
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,350
Oh, thank you!

211
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,670
Love you, Mito.

212
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,510
You were absolutely dazzling out there.

213
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

214
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,830
Yeah, thank you.

215
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,190
You know, obviously I wanted to work with him for so long.

216
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,830
And, uh...

217
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,290
Hold on, let me double check the...

218
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,570
So I don't get the name wrong.

219
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,710
Wait, one second.

220
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,550
Wait, one second.

221
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,910
Wait, one second.

222
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,570
Wait, wait a second.

223
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,310
One second.

224
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,650
Wait, one second.

225
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,170
Scarlet Moon!

226
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,850
Scarlet Moon represents him, right?

227
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,230
They do like a bunch of video game music.

228
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,250
And they...

229
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,350
reached out first!

230
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:51,030
to us they said would you like to work with us for me isn't
that crazy isn't that so crazy

231
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:11,880
oh my gosh so of course I was just like oh oh oh You know, I
was, it's, yeah, I was like, Nori Hiko!

232
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,540
Hibino-san!

233
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,900
And so I kind of came up with this vibe.

234
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,940
I sent like a bunch of, you know, I like that the song is
very jazzy, but kind of lo-fi at the same time.

235
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,020
And hopefully it's a song that you guys can vibe to once I
release it.

236
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,500
Once I release it, so.

237
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:52,780
um but it was really cool because it's maybe the only time
i'll ever be able to debut an original song that is first

238
00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:04,280
heard by you guys with a live band so i'm really glad that
my voice held out for the concert and everything and a jolly

239
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,900
good show a golly good show Hot dog.

240
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hot dog indeed.

241
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,300
Thank you, Dry Princess.

242
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,020
Thank you!

243
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,480
Yeah, and...

244
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,420
Let's see... I'm trying to think of, you know...

245
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,960
The songs I picked.

246
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,140
For the duets as well.

247
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,060
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

248
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,420
Um...

249
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,920
I got you under my skin?

250
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,800
With Amiri?

251
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,820
I don't know, I just felt like her...

252
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,040
...

253
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,440
voice really suited it.

254
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,500
I just felt like she would sound, it would be a fun song to
sing with her.

255
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
So I chose that one with her.

256
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,640
Fly Me to the Moon.

257
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,940
Actually, afterwards, I was thinking I kind of made a
mistake maybe.

258
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Even though I thought of that song because like, you know,
the moon is at night and Nimmy is you know, a tapir, she

259
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,840
eats her nightmares.

260
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,840
But then I was like, wait, I sang a song literally called A
Thousand Dreams of You.

261
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,480
I should have done that as my duet with Nimmy.

262
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,700
Nimmy said she practiced it with her vocal coach.

263
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,520
She sounded incredible.

264
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,200
She sounded so, so good.

265
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,900
And she has her 3D concert this Friday.

266
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,820
So I put out my schedule.

267
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,840
But I will stream and then we'll go into a Nimmy concert.

268
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,940
Mm-hmm.

269
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,700
But I honestly, even though maybe the song choice should
have been a thousand dreams of you, she sounded so cute and

270
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:54,440
fly me to the moon that It was she sounded so she just
sounded so incredible like it Killed me every time I was so

271
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,960
good.

272
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,180
She just sounded so amazing.

273
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Every time I listen to it.

274
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,340
I'm like, oh my gosh She's so good

275
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:20,420
And um And then Honeymoon Undutua with Densets, which was
besides my original song, the only Japanese song in the set

276
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,920
list.

277
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,020
I really have always wanted to sing this song and I felt
like with Densets it would sound really pretty.

278
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,480
So I wanted to sing that one.

279
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,180
And then Beyond the Sea, of course.

280
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,140
It's Sameko Sabah.

281
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,020
Beyond the sea, it just makes sense, no?

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,460
And she sounded so cute.

283
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,740
I love Sabah's singing voice so much.

284
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,140
Congrats on the successful concert!

285
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,340
Thank you!

286
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,760
Thank you, thank you.

287
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,370
Very Sabah-coded, yes!

288
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,190
So I picked that one for her.

289
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:18,030
And yeah, I really, I've just, there are a bunch of songs
that I, a bunch of jazz songs that I like as well.

290
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,670
So I was really happy to be able to sing them all.

291
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,510
Yeah.

292
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,010
I've been hoping for a collab between you and Sabah for a
very long time.

293
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,770
It made me so happy to finally have that wish come true.

294
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,270
Thank you.

295
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,370
Me too.

296
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,510
I was, I was so, so honored that she said, yeah.

297
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,170
So, I hope that we can collab more in the future too.

298
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:46,930
Yes, yes, yes.

299
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,190
Be so fun.

300
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,870
Play some games or something.

301
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,750
If she's ever down.

302
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,570
Yeah.

303
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
No, thank you guys.

304
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,180

Singing with me.

311
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,480
I was like a drink.

312
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,460
A juke for me.

313
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
It was really awesome.

314
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,620
Being able to sing with her.

315
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,100
I'm just really happy I'm just I was so You know With how
many things I was uncertain about It felt like everything

316
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:41,740
could go wrong But For the most part It went really well I
think So I'm really As well as I could do I think Well I'm

It was the best Valentine's ever!

322
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,840
I was hoping that people weren't, wouldn't expect the new
original song.

323
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,900
So that was, that I was excited about.

324
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,980

You're amazing, and we're so lucky to have you as a Roshi.

335
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,800
Thank you.

336
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,800
Don't worry, you can still mess everything up.

337
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't want to mess everything up.

338
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,740
I kept hearing about everybody.

339
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,160
calling him trumpet guy.

340
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,740
I only had a chance to talk to the to the the band.

341
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,240
Just a tiny bit, really.

342
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,000
Mostly to the bassist.

343
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,980
This BGM sounds familiar.

344
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,800
Like a really good song I heard this past weekend.

345
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,580
Are these backing vocals here too?

346
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,980
Actually, no.

347
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,780
That doesn't sound like a me.

348
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:27,760
It's not me It's from the I haven't recorded yet I haven't
recorded it yet Okay Jeez

349
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,730
Did they know about vtubers before this gig?

350
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,290
No!

351
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:47,050
They didn't And It was really funny Like they kept taking
photos with me before the show and uh seems like the people

352
00:26:47,050 --> 00:27:01,490
at the bar were quite confused they were like they were like
is this ai and after the show like they came up and they

353
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:11,870
were like amazing job like you killed it and so did they and
then even the venue staff they were like they were asking

354
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:23,690
like you know all sorts of questions and stuff and I was
like yeah I'm just I'm just a ghost maid I asked one of the

355
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:31,630
bartender ladies and she seemed kind of into the concept
cool I honestly I don't know how the band was found to be

356
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:45,190
honest but uh but one of the bandmates he oh oh my gosh hold
on I don't want My brain, sorry, is still moish.

357
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,450

00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:59,570
He said that he used to play with...

360
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,470

361
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,950
I'm getting ahead of myself.

362
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,210
Sorry.

363
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,970
Can't say goodbye to yesterday from Metal Gear Solid 2.

364
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,230
Sung by the lovely Carla White.

365
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,530
Sadly, she passed away.

366
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:25,190
she but one of the bandmates said that he used to play with
her in New York and he did not know about this song that she

367
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:38,510
sung so it's kind of really awesome that that I could even I
could even show him show him that so and he knew her

368
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,110
personally.

369
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,410
So cool.

370
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:51,430
It's like the whole thing just feels so like honestly just
like such a dream come true.

371
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,530
And I'm really happy that it went well.

372
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,730
And I'm happy that it's over because I was stressed so much
about it.

373
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,350
I'm happy that I was able to do it.

374
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,870
I'm so happy.

375
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,670
No!

376
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,450
I'm not crying.

377
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,470
You're crying.

378
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,830
I'm not crying.

379
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,290
You're crying.

380
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,410
Sorry that I was gone.

381
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,690
for a couple days of.

382
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,170
And and I went to Disney.

383
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,230
Actually, originally, so it was just the one show, right?

384
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,790
And then I was told, I was asked, do you want to do a second
show?

385
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,850
And I was like, of course.

386
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,750
If I could, you know.

387
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:10,990
So!

388
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,790
Glad I got to explore Jazz Concert with you.

389
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,350
I heard you were there on a date.

390
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,630
I was gonna call you out.

391
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,750
I forgot.

392
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,950
People were telling me, they were like, oh yeah, so-and-so's
here.

393
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,910
I met so-and-so.

394
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,770
There were so many familiar names.

395
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,350
And people that traveled from so far.

396
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,790
And, and, people slow dancing in the back.

397
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,980
Only way to desensitize yourself is to do more shows.

398
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,780
I guess so, honestly.

399
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,460
Really proud of you, Minto, you're pretty good.

400
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,400
Thank you.

401
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,540
Yeah, I am.

402
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm so heavy.

403
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,740
What's wrong with slow dancing in the back?

404
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,360
I didn't say anything was wrong with it.

405
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,000
That's how you interpreted it.

406
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,760
Stop being so negative.

407
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,740
Stop being such a negative, Nancy.

408
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,030
One of your Vaughn watchers, and I didn't get a chance to
watch.

409
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,710
Catch a live...

410
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,490
Oh, I don't get a chance to catch a live stream.

411
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,990
I want to say congratulations, you were amazing!

412
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,570
Thank you so much!

413
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,170
Thank you!

414
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,790
And nothing thoughtful to contribute, so congrats on the
successful Double Jazz concert, you made it!

415
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,230
Thank you!

416
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,530
I was saying, they, you know, they said like, do you want to
see about a second show?

417
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,930
And I was like, yes, of course.

418
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:01,570
Originally, uh, I stayed an extra day because the second
show was originally supposed to be on valentine's day

419
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:14,510
actually like valentine's day nine and then sorry hold on my
throat is starting to hurt i had already booked my tickets

420
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:25,810
and then there was like some issues with venue and they were
like the only way to do a second show is to have it at 11 p

421
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:34,550
.m and i was like know I and it would end around 2 a.m.

422
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:46,270
I felt more bad for you guys anybody who had to go to the
second show for that late um I you know I was really

423
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:56,390
grateful obviously I just felt really bad that you were
having to stay so late everybody who had to be there um and

424
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:07,070
you know I honestly like you know I didn't really give it a
second thought at all like I I was like of course you know

425
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,710
of course I would do it even though that means staying up
until 4 a.m.

426
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:17,010
EST not even just staying up until 4 a.m.

427
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:33,030
EST but singing and being excitable and everything so did
you feel sleepy or did the nerves keep you up I was so

428
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:42,570
sleepy in between shows i was just kind of like it's funny
because after the first show i was like i felt so relieved i

429
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:49,990
was like i did it i did it and you know for some reason my
brain was was not comprehending that i had to do it all over

430
00:33:49,990 --> 00:34:01,510
again how hard did you pass out after i was still so jet
lagged that even though i went to 3 a.m.

431
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,410
PST I still woke up at 7 a.m.

432
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,510
because I usually wake up around that same time in EST so I
woke up at 7 a.m.

433
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:31,570
PST despite everything but it's okay I I took it pretty easy
on Saturday I hung out with some friends actually I don't

434
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:46,890
really go out on like holidays and stuff so I I didn't know
people went out on Valentine's Day like you know like I just

435
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:57,390
I don't know but we went to like a gardens together to walk
around and there were so many couples

436
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:17,730
the most ever they still do it's kind of crazy it was so
many people I guess that's what happens if a holiday like

437
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:32,890
Valentine's Day is on Saturday what do you think happens on
Valentine's Day I don't know I don't know I think people I

it's about love in general and you can love your friends and

472
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:04,680
you can love your hobbies and you can love anything that you
like so that's you know if you spend it with those people

473
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,160

474
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:25,840

512
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:36,580

cupcakes they were like the size of a thumbnail the box was

513
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:44,140
so deceivingly large i was like i opened them up and was
like

514

I was like, wait, I swear, I'm not trying to, actually, they
were expensive.

515
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,420
I tried to get, like, fancy chocolates for everybody.

516
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:02,060
I was like, this, I swear I'm not cheaping out on you guys.

517
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,700
Nice of Steiner to let you sing at his live Yu-Gi-Oh card
pack opening.

518
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,800
That guy has all of the, what is it?

519
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:23,800
all of this this is going to his head he would come back to
me and he would be like like while I was waiting backstage

to his head So please understand You must bully the manager

523
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:03,480
You must bully the manager It's very very important He must
know his place Back in my day

524
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,360
The future is now old man

528
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,840
You're amazing, Minky.

529
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,520
Thank you.

530
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,480
I'm really not.

531
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm really not.

532
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm not.

533
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,400
Oh my gosh!

534
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,860
I forgot to say something so important!

535
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:05,940
My!

536
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,840
My!

537
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,710
Flower stand!

538
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,510
My flower stand!

539
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,190
My first ever!

540
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,730
My first ever flower stand!

541
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,030
It was so pretty!

542
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,670
It was so...

543
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,750
I got to take home the...

544
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,470
All the stuff.

545
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,730
Like the little...

546
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,810
I got to take... I took home everything.

547
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,850
I took home the little Ibu's on top.

548
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,910
I took home the big pieces.

549
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,390
I have everybody's names.

550
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:48,730
And...

551
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,890
I took off everything.

552
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,170
My first ever flower stamp.

553
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,940
So happy.

554
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,440
It looks so beautiful.

555
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
So glad you liked it.

556
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,420
Glad you liked it.

557
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,900
Sorry, I'm going to take you.

558
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,260
I'm a random doctor from a far-off country, and it's my
birthday, I!

559
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,000
Happy birthday, 16th doctor!

560
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,580
I'll watch your concert later, hoping the best is ever.

561
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,320
Thank you so much, and happy, happy, happy birthday.

562
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,580
Yeah, I was so...

563
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,360
Oh my gosh, thank you, everybody.

564
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,660
Thank you!

565
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,140
I was so happy.

566
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,520
Since you didn't give us chocolate, can we lick the one
dripping down your legs?

567
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,120
Yeah, you can lick the one in the curtains over there in the
back.

568
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,980
The one on my legs is not edible.

569
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,360
It's decoration.

570
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,240
You know what else looks so beautiful?

571
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,620
Mint in the red dress!

572
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,400
Thank you!

573
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,960
I got chocolate on Valentine's Day for helping move
furniture!

574
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,540
It was a Tony's Choco Lonely Bar.

575
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,880
What's a lonely bar?

576
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,720
What is

577
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,250
that love?

578
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,410
Oh, thank you!

579
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,060
Thanks for making my world a better place than me or
everyone who got to see the show live!

580
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,580
New name, by the way.

581
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,060
YouTube said I had to change it.

582
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,220
Might change again.

583
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,300
Why YouTube said you have to change your name?

584
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,800
It's just a brand of chocolate.

585
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,260
Huh.

586
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,060
Lonely is so good.

587
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,140
Wait, I'm gonna look it up.

588
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,220
The name sounds familiar.

589
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,540
Lonely is Chocolate Lonely.

590
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,760
Oh!

591
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,960
I have had this before.

592
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,480
These are good.

593
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,160
These are yummy.

594
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,680
Wait, if somebody give me these!

595
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:30,740
This is like, this is like the adult version of getting a
full-size candy bar when you go trick-or-treating as a kid.

596
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,940
That's how excited I get when I...

597
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,180
You know, this is...

598
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,740
These are good.

599
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,940
Congratulations on such a great concert, Vito.

600
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,740
Sorry I missed it.

601
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,560
Oh, it's so good.

602
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,820
Definitely gonna join the pod while I stowed in.

603
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,180
Stay warm!

604
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,380
They're really good if you've never tried these.

605
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,560
Chocolon.

606
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,100
Wait, you got paid nice.

607
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,200
These are tasty.

608
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,760
Toasty, tasty.

609
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,320
What if somebody gave you a Costco mint shake?

610
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,960
I feel like I have to go to Costco now to try it.

611
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,360
I'm shocked.

612
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm shocked that they added that to the menu.

613
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,280
I want to try it, though.

614
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,140
Chocolate mint shake at Costco.

615
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,360
I just got it.

616
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,680
It's pretty good, really.

617
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,760
It does taste good.

618
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,920
They just smirked giving it.

619
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,060
Oh, they smirked while giving...

620
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,620
Hello, Minto.

621
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,040
Chocolate mint is everywhere recently.

622
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,040
I just can't get out of your brains.

623
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,580
My branding is so powerful.

624
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,380
It was also like 700 calories.

625
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,340
Mint.

626
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,480
Wherever I go, I see your face.

627
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,180
Binto, you're on my mind 24-7.

628
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,180
Still me.

629
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,440
Samoy!

630
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,340
Thank you for taking the photo.

631
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,880
Oops, no, sorry, I hit my mic.

632
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,860
The photos!

633
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,600
It's wild how fast those photos spread in Discord before I
even upload them to Flickr.

634
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,000
I need to hire you as like official photographer

635
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,690
your photos are so great

636
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:53,090
just like you with Fubuki oh yeah that did you guys see that
my tweet about the Fubuki house I kept looking at it every

637
00:49:53,090 --> 00:50:02,530

over me please actually I think on Friday even I was like

638
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,630
Fubuki please bless my show please

639
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,550
It looked so much like her.

640
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,330
Had real Fubuzella in your backyard.

641
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,070
I know.

642
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,390
So great to hear how happy you are about this.

643
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,450
We're so proud of you, Minky.

644
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,610
Thank you.

645
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:31,790
You know, obviously, I'm very ultra critical.

646
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:33,890
Oh, see, thank you.

647
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,990
Yeah, understate how proud of you I am.

648
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,710
for your incredible performance but also for what this show
means for making your dreams come true and spreading me to

649
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:51,690
be pleased thank you thank you sd look at that thank you
thank you for one of the best nights of my life i'm so happy

650
00:50:51,690 --> 00:51:04,170
for you i was worried that you know it's not like your
typical show you know i was like maybe if my set list is too

651
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,430
traditionally jazzy people would be like, oh, this is
boring.

652
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:16,290
You know, I don't think that, because I love jazz, but I
hope that you've been well.

653
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,310
Thank you.

654
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,190
I am.

655
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,090
I'm so relieved that it's over.

656
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,760
Wait, I mean overstate.

657
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,600
No, I understand what you meant.

658
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,040
It's okay.

659
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,660
Do we know when the original song comes out?

660
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,060
Right now it might be a bit because I am so busy.

661
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:53,080
I don't think I'll have time to record before I leave for
Japan, so I watched online.

662
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,740
It was great.

663
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,700
Thank you.

664
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,360
Thank you.

665
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:56,940
Thank you.

666
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,620
Hi.

667
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,380
I just promised I held a watch party.

668
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,160
Everyone in attendance was very impressed that Orison kicked
ass.

669
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,860
We made red bell.

670
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,120
helmet cake to celebrate.

671
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,360
Wait, that's awesome!

672
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,300
Skeletop, I hope you had a great birthday party.

673
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,560
That's okay, I was just asking Song was a killer.

674
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,020
No!

675
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,880
Thank you for asking.

676
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:27,480
Hmm.

677
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,280
Can you record it in Japan?

678
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Maybe.

679
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,300
Maybe.

680
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:39,940
Hmm.

681
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,500
How long did you practice with the musicians for the show?

682
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,440
One hour.

683
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,060
It was like maybe like an hour and a half.

684
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,660
Definitely the rehearsal time got cut a bit because of some
tech issues.

685
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,520
It's great to see you again on my birthday!

686
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,760
Hey, I'm still happy birthday!

687
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
Happy birthday!

688
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Welcome to the cafe jazz edit needs to happen that would be
really awesome I really like the jazz version so great Daryl

689
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:30,020
did an amazing job at doing the redition

690
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:38,020
musicians seem like they had the instrumentals down pat well
they were given the set list

691
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:55,820
maybe I don't remember maybe two months in advance I believe
So that You know I'm sure some of the songs They're very

692
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:07,600
classic jazz songs So they would know those But Especially
for like some of the other songs Like Sneakier And Can't say

693
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,920
goodbye to yesterday And of course my original songs So Yeah
yeah yeah Yeah

694
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:28,720
burning question why are they called the la diamond trio if
there are four of them i don't know don't ask of me i don't

695
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,120
know don't ask of me

696
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,280
that's that's outside of my knowledge

697
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:52,820
maybe it's like pinky and the brain and larry version of
snake eater was amazing i i felt so i seriously i just can't

698
00:54:52,820 --> 00:55:02,160
stop being like wow i got to sing snake eater with a live
band wow wow

699
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:14,200
the important questions why is your name in phantom if you
are turquoise

700
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,280
Terry can't say goodbye to yesterday.

701
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,980
A bunch of us were IRL pogging and jumping at the trumpet
player waiting for the five-minute sax solo to start.

702
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:35,900
You know, actually, the version that they sent me for can't
say goodbye to yesterday was much short, was shortened like

703
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,300
crazy.

704
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:43,200
So they ended up going for the full version, which I think
was really, really awesome.

705
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:56,340
so that was that was them yeah they went ham all on their
own i think that they maybe enjoyed it so they uh like it

706
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:05,580
was a little shorter ish but yeah it wasn't it was uh the
version that i was practicing off of was even shorter than

707
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,120
that so it did good me thank you

708
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,140
So happy, so happy.

709
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,410
Now I can say that I've performed with a live jazz band.

710
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,290
I'm a jazz singer, baby.

711
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,390
I'm a jazz singer, baby.

712
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:45,790
Though, I'm like, you know, I'm like singing seriously,
right?

713
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:50,510
But for all my MCs, I'm like, I'm like, Okie dokie, guys!

714
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,510
Are you ready for the next song?

715
00:56:54,930 --> 00:57:03,930
I couldn't set the mood in the place at all I was I was like
Hey guys It's time for the next song

716
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:19,230
Instead of being like Hey all you cool cats there out in the
crowd Here's a special one for you For you and your special

717
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:27,120
someone No instead I'm like Guys Guys I'm nervous

718
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:38,080
I couldn't stop saying Okido You are so beautiful in the red
dress.

719
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,000
Thank you.

720
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,240
It's so strange.

721
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,320
Oh man, having my hair fully down.

722
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,060
It feels so strange.

723
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,340
I'm being all dressed up.

724
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,280
Weird.

725
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,360
I wouldn't have you any other way.

726
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,800
I don't think I could change.

727
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,120
In the free VOD preview, you actually say okie dokie.

728
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,140
Don't tell me that!

729
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,620
Okay, I have time to nuke the VOD.

730
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,640
I would have died if he did do that.

731
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:21,500
What?

732
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,780
Try to be like a cool professional.

733
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,760
Not only are you a jazz singer, you're a professional jazz
singer that sold out the house twice!

734
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,760
Oh, you're right.

735
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,000
Okie dokie.

736
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:39,880
No!

737
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,100
All that Okie dokie was just the Fallout brain rot.

738
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,460
Is that a thing in Fallout?

739
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,920
I was talking to some of the...

740
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,620
Oh, she sparked staff before the show.

741
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:54,980
No.

742
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,240
Yes, before the show.

743
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,720
And I was like, you know, I've never played Fallout before.

744
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:04,040
But some of the songs that I have in my set list are really
popular because of Fallout.

745
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,240
The MC says a lot.

746
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,520
Oh my gosh, it's so funny.

747
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,820
And, um...

748
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,060
And they were like, oh, I didn't know, I didn't know.

749
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,420
Oh, I would like to play it someday because, you know, of...

750
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,240
I feel like the aesthetic is really cool.

751
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:28,520
But, um, afterwards, after the first show, I was, like,
scrolling through the hashtag.

752
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,180
And I saw...

753
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:36,440
Surprisingly, I saw some, like, Japanese viewers watching,
and I was so surprised.

754
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,240
So I was really happy.

755
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,440
But there was one that was in Japanese that was, like...

756
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,900
Oh, yeah.

757
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:56,800
the song she's saying it's from fallout and i was like i was
like even in japan even in japan it is not some chips thank

758
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:07,560
you gee minto what do you want to do tonight the same thing

759
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,740

760
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,230
JP loves the fallout show, do they?

761
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,350
Concert, congrats, miito, thank you!

762
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,750
Wow.

763
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:34,090
Yeah, fallout, yeah, definitely, you know, obviously the
songs were popular in their own way as well, but, like, into

764
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,230
kind of like a mainstream.

765
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:38,350
Into the gamer, into the gamer media.

766
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,370
Fallout taught several generations about jazz.

767
01:00:45,590 --> 01:01:03,150
did that don't you forget it oh my gosh MGS4 announcement I
feel so I I listened back to when I was on Doki stream first

768
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:11,290
of all I want to say I'm so sorry I couldn't do my own watch
along I so what had happened was is I installed everything

769
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,230
on my computer.

770
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,970
My travel setup computer, I mean.

771
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,510
Arigato, Arigato, too.

772
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:17,890
Kamo, thank you.

773
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,930
It was a great way to spend my birthday weekend.

774
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,530
I wouldn't have had any other way.

775
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,330
Thank you.

776
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,090
Happy birthday.

777
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,870

778
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,890

779
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:30,850
You were great and beautiful.

780
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:31,890
You're saying it was amazing.

781
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,010

782
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

783
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:36,710
Um.

784
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,000
Um.

785
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:54,980
Yes, so I had installed everything on my travel computer and
then I It was Windows 11 and I Pushed it back to Windows 10

786
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:09,260
And after I did that I completely Spaced I was like I forgot
to reinstall everything I was like Oh my gosh I'm such a

787
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:14,420
dummy Dumbhead I was like no I forgot to.

788
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,720
And I, like there were a bunch of drivers things that were
not working.

789
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:30,800
And I, like, I had a Bluetooth keyboard that I didn't
reconnect.

790
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,540
And it was just, it was a mess.

791
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,920
I was like, oh my gosh.

792
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,880
And the Bluetooth keyboard that I brought with me was not
corded.

793
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,420
So I, it was, it was all or nothing.

794
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,180
It was, and so I was like, oh my gosh.

795
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:50,340
um so i really apologize about that that was all on me i
even made like the the waiting room and everything i was

796
01:02:50,340 --> 01:03:03,680

01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,740
I know, I know.

800
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,200
The Watch Along with Doki was very funny, though.

801
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,680
I was watching a clip.

802
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,340
I didn't know how bad I was cutting out.

803
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,420
It literally was going like, little, middle gear, little.

804
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:50,390
Because it's funny because I was like, I was throwing myself
on the bed.

805
01:03:50,990 --> 01:04:02,710
around i was screaming and uh also my my stream would not
sink for some reason and then i also my stream stopped

806
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:14,410
working when metal gear got announced i gotta get you to try

I am surprised that portable ops is not in the collection.

01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,260
I did see some people.

845
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,200

Oh, heyo!

for Ashton as well.

848
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,020
And I saw people saying they hoped for...

849
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,860
I saw someone saying, like...

850
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:50,820
Um...

851
01:06:50,820 --> 01:07:04,800
They were like, I want to see Metal Gear rising on modern
day consoles and I'm like but it's on Steam it's it's on

852
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:17,600
Steam but I imagine that probably MGS4 takes up so much
space probably but yeah it goes Vival

853
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,700
so many people's first time with Peace Walk on yeah

854
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:41,850
I mean I get that PC is not a console but it's so easy to
get the steam deck is a

855
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:58,800
console steam version doesn't have DLC what's the DLC what
the did they have DLC for you see snake is coming to rainbow

856
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,360
rainbow six siege I did I've been tagged by at least 500
people.

857
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,680
Actually, Doki sent me a thing right before stream.

858
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,400
She was like, are you going to play Rainbow Six Siege?

859
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,620
And I was like, no.

860
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:18,630
No.

861
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,290
Thank you, thank you.

862
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,010
Hi, chat.

863
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,510
I'm new here.

864
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,630
Does Mint not like Death Stranding or does she just like Big
Boss so much?

865
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,890
Hi, welcome.

866
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,870
I do like Death Stranding.

867
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,250
I just haven't beat it yet.

868
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:36,690
And and I do love Big Boss.

869
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:38,890
I just love Metal Gear.

870
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,570
Actually, I love Metal Gear in general.

871
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:41,670
Not just Big Boss.

872
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,230
I love all the Metal Gear.

873
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,570
But yeah, I'm afraid of playing Rainbow Six Siege.

874
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:55,410
So I'm afraid of being called very colorful names.

875
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,450
And also, I'm scared of everything.

876
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,550
I'm scared.

877
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,200
Green.

878
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,360
Yeah, they're gonna call me green.

879
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,280
Just got back from dinner.

880
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:17,780
Ooh, yummy!

881
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,960
Did you see Sam Fisher and Solid Sankey?

882
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,480
Solid Sankey!

883
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,020
What if you both were bad at Rainbow Six Siege together and
you got to play Snake?

884
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:34,820
Look.

885
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,960
You know, I have the Snake skin on...

886
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:39,980
Fortnite?

887
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,200
Snake and Fortnite did not give me to play Fortnite.

888
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,800
I don't think Snake and Rainbow Six Siege will give me to
play.

889
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:50,300
I mean, I love that they added him.

890
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:51,980
Don't get me wrong.

891
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,480
Love the concert.

892
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,660
Me and my tape here are right next to the table throwing
room.

893
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,680
The roses on stage were so sweet.

894
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,940
Thank you guys.

895
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,000
Thank you.

896
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,200
Thank you, thank you.

897
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,590
Rising is actually region locked.

898
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,670
Oh, I think it's region locked.

899
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:25,290
Or rather, I don't think it's region locked anymore, but
there was a while.

900
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,710
It was for a while, I believe Japan couldn't have it, no?

901
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,930
This bio in game has a description from AutoCAD.

902
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,050
Wait, that's so cute!

903
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,570
I can't believe it.

904
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,430
how well the Ibu were dressed for the show.

905
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,350
It was so cute!

906
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,490
It was so so so cute.

907
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:51,970
Yay!

908
01:10:54,250 --> 01:11:00,710
I also saw some people wishing that Twin Snakes were on were
in the Master Collection.

909
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:10,510
But I think we'll probably I would, I hope we see that in
the GameCube uh collection for the Switch, you know?

910
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,350
Um...

911
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:16,670
YouTube is down worldwide.

912
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:17,490
Oh.

913
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:18,970
Oh no!

914
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:20,250
Wait, what's that have to do with me?

915
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,990
Oh no!

916
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,780
I think, uh...

917
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,320
I think with the Twin Snakes, there's a couple...

918
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,760
couple things with it, right?

919
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,540
Because it was...

920
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:52,040
You know, say... I think it's like tied up in legal stuff
with What's it called, Silicon Knights?

921
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,680
They don't exist anymore.

922
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,060
And then...

923
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:04,180
And then also, if it's like a Nintendo thing, like they
couldn't just put the game on only the Master Collection

924
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,760
that's released for the Switch, you know?

925
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,460
So...

926
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:13,120
I hope that we get it for the GameCube Collection on the
Switch instead.

927
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,680
It's like that Tetris stream from 2020 all over again.

928
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,300
Oh my gosh.

929
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,220
you're right!

930
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,240
It is.

931
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,440
Yeah, licensing and stuff.

932
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,860
Silicon Knights, eternal darkness.

933
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,660
I hope, though.

934
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,840
I hope, I hope, I hope.

935
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,140
If they can add Sora and Smash, they could get Twin Snakes.

936
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,240
We'll see.

937
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,320
Maybe in the future.

938
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,100
I think it would be fun to have it.

939
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:45,720
Yeah.

940
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,780
I think it would be fun to have it.

941
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,100
Hopefully in the future.

942
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:07,430
Some of the RE6, oh not RE6, R6 characters are getting
Merrill, Psycho Mantis, and Grey Fox skins as well.

943
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,590
What?

944
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,530
The rainbow, that's Rainbow Six, right?

945
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:10,970
Yeah.

946
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,890
Going to get the new Naked Snake Nendo.

947
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:15,830
He can go on a date with Koharu.

948
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:17,610
Wait.

949
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:25,910
If I ever get a Nendoroid one day, then I can be next to
Snake and Koharu.

950
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,570
and Ryden ooh, Ryden

951
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:51,150
wait, I want an Enderoy now I want an Enderoy I didn't think
about that

952
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,840
I could be next to both of them

953
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:18,220
it wasn't in production already I think you guys I love that
you guys give me so much credit but I didn't get only

think that things are in production like that I'm not just

957
01:14:53,140 --> 01:15:03,060

960
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:28,760

962
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,100
yeah ish yeah

963
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:57,030
for me it's cool bragging rights and also it was one of the
most terrifying experiences of my afterlife that i will be

964
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,590
able to tell you guys once about it

965
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:09,570

01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:10,370
So I would like to say once again, if you cannot afford a
merch, or if you cannot afford to go to an event, or

971
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:18,510
something like that, I know, especially events suck because
of FOMO and everything, but please do not, do not, do not,

972
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,230
do not go into bed.

973
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,630
Thank you so much for the redirect.

974
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,990
Thank you, thank you!

975
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,930
Everyone's talking about the YouTube main page.

976
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:35,750
Is it really down?

977
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:39,430
Oh wow, it really is.

978
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,250
I go to it and I see nothing.

979
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:44,130
Wow.

980
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:45,710
Wow.

981
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:51,450
Wait, how am I gonna watch my deer cam?

982
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,910
Good thing I know what it's called.

983
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,740
We're locked in with Minto.

984
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,880
I was thinking of going soon.

985
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,600
I know it's a little bit of a shorter stream.

986
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,360
I apologize.

987
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:15,600
Because...

988
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,180
My voice...

989
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,940
Tomorrow I have no stream.

990
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,940
I was like, I'm gonna rest my voice.

991
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,760
But you know what I have to do?

992
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,540
I have to record more Portal 2.

993
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:37,760
I support Minto even at 26.99 APY.

994
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:38,500
No!

995
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,600
As long as you don't make a Funko, Minky.

996
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:48,900
I was approached not by Funko, but I was approached by
another company of a similar sword.

997
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,820
I did say no.

998
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,910
I did turn that down.

999
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,130
Because I...

1000
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,210
Didn't want to.

1001
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:05,810
So...

1002
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,740
Why did my tongue come out?

1003
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:26,660
Uh...

1004
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,400
Yes.

1005
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:32,610
Bam.

1006
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,370
Yes, yes.

1007
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,430
Uh...

1008
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:39,690
Wonderful concert!

1009
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:44,370
Your sound lovely is okay if I miss the Toronto meet and
greet since I see Yoko Kano the next weekend.

1010
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,470
Of course, Nicholas.

1011
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,130
Though I will miss you.

1012
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,690
I feel like I haven't seen that at a meet and greet in a
while.

1013
01:19:55,310 --> 01:20:03,690
no no no i did not get an offer for funko pop i did not i
did not is what i was saying but there was another company

1014
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:15,230

i love yoshi

1015
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,090

La booboo?

1017
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:38,730
Isn't it crazy how La booboos are like totally out of style
now?

1018
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:40,730
Is that so crazy?

1019
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,810
Like you don't see people using them at all anymore.

1020
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,490
They lasted a while though.

1021
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,290
I still liked how La booboos looked.

1022
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:57,890
I still thought they were cute.

1023
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,780
But I didn't get one in the end.

1024
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,630
Fads be fighting.

1025
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,620
Yeah, they do.

1026
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:10,910
Yeah, they do.

1027
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,550
Labu, labu, labu.

1028
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:19,230
I always said, do you need more Minto merch?

1029
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:21,410
Excited for your new plans.

1030
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:22,630
Thank you!

1031
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:29,770
Fugglers?

1032
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,430
I like Fugglers.

1033
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:36,210
I like, I like ugly cute things though.

1034
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,710
Minky Outlast and Laboobus.

1035
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:41,570
Yippee!

1036
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,800
But I'm dead.

1037
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,880
I, I, no.

1038
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,320
I persevered!

1039
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,420
Oh.

1040
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,540
Fugglers have more soul.

1041
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,560
My YouTube feed is down, but Minky is up and working.

1042
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,360
Ah, crazy.

1043
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,080
Feed is...

1044
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,280
I wonder what's going on with YouTube.

1045
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,900
Really is down.

1046
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:19,580
Wait, can I...

1047
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:19,760
Oh!

1048
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:20,780
Oh!

1049
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,040
I can't even get to, like, my channel.

1050
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,540
I need a Minto Bionicle.

1051
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:30,500
Oh.

1052
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,420
I will...

1053
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:35,900
If I...

1054
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,920
Hopefully one day...

1055
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,220
I would really love, like...

1056
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,100
It doesn't have to be a scale figure.

1057
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,200
But like, you know, even like a pop-up parade.

1058
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,920
I would be really excited about...

1059
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,370
I would be really excited about that.

1060
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:55,530
If I could get...

1061
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,590
That would be a goal of mine.

1062
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,330
One to one scale.

1063
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:05,370
One to one scale figure.

1064
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:09,130
One seventh scale.

1065
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:26,170
one-sixth one-fourth bunny me yeah yeah what is that brand
that does all the one-fourth uh one-fourth uh what is what

1066
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:38,670

1067
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:39,950

1068
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:44,330
Ah!

1069
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:45,990
Oh my god.

1070
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,200
Okay.

1071
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,280
I'll ask Steiner Manet if it's possible.

1072
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,060
I'll ask if it's possible.

1073
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,480
Never say it's impossible.

1074
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,480
Minto Companion Cube?

1075
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,480
No way.

1076
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,560
Wait.

1077
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,740
Minto Half-Life 3.

1078
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,450
Minto in Half-Life 3.

1079
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,060
Or in Portal 3.

1080
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,580
Companion Cube.

1081
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,300
Please, Gabin.

1082
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,100
Welcome back, Frosted Channel.

1083
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:06,980
Thank you.

1084
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,360
I almost don't want to leave because...

1085
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,100
Because YouTube is down, I feel like I'm rare.

1086
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,300
That I'm streaming.

1087
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,320
I'm like, ugh.

1088
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,220
I'm the chosen one.

1089
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,700
It's my birthday tomorrow if you have a good time off.

1090
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:28,800
And or playing Portal.

1091
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,680
Jeez!

1092
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,080
I'm sorry!

1093
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,020
Happy birthday!

1094
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:42,340
It's funny because if I stream, or not stream, if I record
portal tomorrow, you will know.

1095
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,280
What if I streamed it without looking at chat at all?

1096
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:54,340
Like it was like a normal playthrough and then I private the
bot and then when I go to upload it.

1097
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,280
I would just do it like how I have been doing.

1098
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:10,800
It would just be a little preview of the portal playthrough.

1099
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,640
And I wouldn't be looking at chat at all because there would
be no chat.

1100
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,660
Could you resist looking at chat?

1101
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:21,880
I would literally minimize it.

1102
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,200
Backseaters will mauldhard.

1103
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,340
There's only been a few puzzles that I've been stuck on.

1104
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,980
I can't quite remember where I'm at now, though.

1105
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,300
But I...

1106
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,320
I am on chapter...

1107
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,320
I'm either on chapter 6 or...

1108
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:47,940
I

1109
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:06,930
think I am on chapter 7.

1110
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,400
I won't say it.

1111
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,940
I won't give you the satisfaction.

1112
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,420
I won't give you the satisfaction.

1113
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:41,140
It's actually kind of funny when it comes up naturally you
honestly Don't realize it's such a the two numbers are such

1114
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:50,560
a good like guesstimator you don't realize how often you
actually say it You know what I mean?

1115
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:58,540
Like it's kind of insane How how often

1116
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:07,080
that those two numbers became such a meme are like so funny.

1117
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,900
Say it.

1118
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,320
Mr. Mick, Flap, look at it.

1119
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:15,680
Don't.

1120
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,180
Don't.

1121
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,600
Don't eat that amount.

1122
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,240
Don't go to the dark side.

1123
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,760
I've only realized it now that I've been trying to avoid it.

1124
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,880
I know, me too.

1125
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:31,800
Ugh.

1126
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,040
the painful realization.

1127
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,580
Yes, YouTube is down, everybody.

1128
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,580
YouTube is down.

1129
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,960
But you are safe here.

1130
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,360
You are safe in my little channel.

1131
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,260
Actually, I think I'm gonna go though.

1132
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:51,990
I wonder...

1133
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,490
There was a place I wanted to see if I could go to.

1134
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,080
What the heck?

1135
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:06,760
I cannot believe my VOD preview got... It cannot be
monetized.

1136
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,640
It can't be monetized!

1137
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,980
I was too good.

1138
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,100
Sounding like the original.

1139
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,180
Oh my god.

1140
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:18,660
It's alright.

1141
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,460
Hold on one second.

1142
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,040
It's okay.

1143
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,200
They usually don't get monetized anyway.

1144
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,180
See like roses?

1145
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:38,500
My crew brought bouquet and grateful to the venue to see
this next to the stage.

1146
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,760
Tossing Rose for Can't Say Goodbye.

1147
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,180
fine.

1148
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,140
Snake eater was such a thrill.

1149
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,300
Thanks for a great show.

1150
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,060
I love the roses!

1151
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,240
Thank you!

1152
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,380
Thank you!

1153
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,420
Yeah!

1154
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:53,000
I love them.

1155
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,040
Thank you so much.

1156
01:29:54,980 --> 01:30:00,620
I feel like we need a Walter White clip where his face is
replaced with a 6 and 7 and he says, say my name.

1157
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:08,070
Sound like that jazz singer and mint phantom.

1158
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:10,750
Walter.

1159
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,010
Say my name.

1160
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:26,930
You're damn right are you gonna upload a full video of the
concert that is a great question um right now because

1161
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:39,650
there's the streaming tickets up uh not at the moment um
perhaps in you know i haven't discussed this with literally

1162
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:53,210
anybody um but perhaps in maybe a long long long long time
from now maybe in like a year or so because obviously that

1163
01:30:53,210 --> 01:31:01,530
would not be fair for the people who are purchasing the
streaming tickets and everything but I would for my own sake

1164
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:10,950
I would really love it to be archived somewhere so everyone
killed it on stage my only regret was not being there in

1165
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:17,510
person but it was life after life changing regardless I'm
telling all my normie friends how awesome it was.

1166
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:21,370
Hope you like the Roku Nana name and the flower stand.

1167
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:26,570
I don't think I...

1168
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:27,070
Wait, what?

1169
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:28,870
Was that you?

1170
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,990
I don't think I should...

1171
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:36,490
I googled whether YouTube was down only to hear Minto
confirm my suspicions.

1172
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:37,570
Yep.

1173
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:42,210
It's so funny how, like, when YouTube goes down,
literally...

1174
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:45,850
If...

1175
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,130
When YouTube goes down...

1176
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:58,550
uh everybody like starts freaking out they're coming into my
chat being like youtube down for your eyes my youtube shorts

1177
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:08,830
how am i supposed to watch the next part of of of hell's
kitchen that has been released in seven shorts youtube

1178
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:34,440
shorts goodness gracious um I would like to ask, though, you
know, I know that I can't stop people from uploading the

1179
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:43,380
full version of the concert, but I would love to ask that
you do not so that I could do it myself.

1180
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:46,360
Eventually.

1181
01:32:48,740 --> 01:33:03,060
So, I hope that people will respect that so that we can keep
doing more streams and such and such of things like this in

1182
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:12,680
the future so pet girls thank you i'm late hi me though
