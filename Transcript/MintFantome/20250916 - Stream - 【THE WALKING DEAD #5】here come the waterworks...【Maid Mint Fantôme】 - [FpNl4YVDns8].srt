1
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,460
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:27,960
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:41,800
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Come on, let's go.

4
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Come on, hey.

5
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,640
Come

6
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
back, everybody.

7
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,060
Thank you.

8
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,300
So much for the family, you gifted.

9
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,140
What the heck.

10
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

11
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Gosh, thank you so much.

12
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,800
We're here at the finale of The Walking Dead Season 1.

13
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,680
I'm sad.

14
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm so sad.

15
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,930
Because I think I'm gonna cry.

16
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,710
I mean, that was my birthday.

17
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,750
I hope there aren't too many waterworks.

18
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,310
Melody, happy birthday!

19
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,770
Happy, happy birthday!

20
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,170
Do I need tissues?

21
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,890
Oh, wait.

22
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,430
Wait, hold on.

23
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,210
I was like, wait, I saw tissues earlier.

24
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,730
I forgot to pick them up.

25
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,270
I think I dropped them earlier.

26
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
Wait, hold on.

27
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,330
How am I supposed to reach?

28
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,240
Okay.

29
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,680
Okie dokie.

30
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,520
So, last time,

31
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,720
Uh...

32
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
We went to...

33
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,740
I keep wanting to call it Ravenholm.

34
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
But it's definitely not that.

35
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
We went to...

36
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,300
Craw...

37
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,360
Crawfish.

38
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,340
Crawford?

39
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,700
Craw...

40
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:34,960
Something.

41
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,490
Crow...

42
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,660
Crawford.

43
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,380
We went to Crawford.

44
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,460
And...

45
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,320
Um...

46
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,260
They were all taken over.

47
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Whomp, womp.

48
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,360
And then we meet some new people.

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,140
And one of them dies.

50
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,840
Uh-oh.

51
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,740
One guy doesn't like us.

52
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,380
And he saw a horde of zombies coming in.

53
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,000
And they booked it out.

54
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,300
They left.

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,160
They took everything and left.

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,100
Almost missed the stream because I decided to take a nap after work.

57
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:13,860
Otoo!

58
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Let's get Clem back.

59
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,780
Yeah!

60
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,260
Whoa.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,400
Oh yeah, Clem was taken by the guy on the radio.

62
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
We still don't know who that is.

63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,660
And you let Ben die, right?

64
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,040
Ben is unfortunately still alive.

65
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,200
I was too chicken to kill that guy.

66
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,620
I'm kind of interested in how else he'll mess up, quite honestly.

67
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,140
I'm interested.

68
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,620
This guy is like a walking death flag.

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,260
Everybody around him just...

70
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,740
Everybody dies.

71
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
His best friend, his teacher died.

72
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,580
Kenny's family.

73
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,920
I mean, the guy just sucks.

74
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,960
It boggles my mind.

75
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,300
They had the survivalist culpa with enforced abortions.

76
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,940
That's the opposite of survival.

77
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,140
Yeah, they were like no babies.

78
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,800
No babies, no old people.

79
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,060
I get the no old people.

80
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,940
But no babies?

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,140
I don't really understand it.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,620
Maybe because they'll cry.

83
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,980
You can't be stealthy with a baby.

84
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,400
Huh.

85
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,300
I'm not quite sure.

86
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,340
I think they're silly people.

87
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,440
And now they're all zombie people.

88
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,120
More babies is more mouths to feed.

89
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,580
I mean, yeah.

90
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,260
But if you have like a whole school.

91
00:07:48,800 --> 00:08:02,400
like you can you can make a garden you can you can grow your own food the ground isn't isn't bad it's not infected i think

92
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:30,150
but uh we found a boat we did find a boat and unfortunately also lee got bitten was it bitten or like scratched it didn't really look like a bite mark no old people like how old exactly no hags everybody disliked that oh it is a bite okay he got chopped

93
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:45,440
so we know how this is we know a little bit of how this is gonna end and i'm so sad oh it is intended to be a bite i see

94
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
Who's your favorite character so far?

95
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
And who's your least favorite?

96
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,320
Ben incoming.

97
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,040
No, I disliked that girl's dad more than Ben.

98
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,940
Test this with a whisp-softboard server.

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,860
Larry, yeah.

100
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,160
I disliked Larry more than I disliked Ben.

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,140
Larry was just insufferable.

102
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,680
That guy only wanted to fight.

103
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,060
That guy sucked.

104
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,880
And then...

105
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,660
My favorite character.

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,020
I think Clementine's too easy of a choice.

107
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,100
I really liked Molly.

108
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,800
I wish she would have stuck around for more.

109
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,300
We met her last episode.

110
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,700
It's hard because all my friends are dying.

111
00:09:49,700 --> 00:10:17,860
to be sure we get a character and then i really liked um oh my gosh what was her name the love interest for lee carly i liked her a lot too recently i heard your disappointment at lack of marriage proposals wait luckily for you per the recent economic downturn i find it advantageous to ask for your hand in marriage what does that mean

112
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,580
Doug?

113
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,580
I don't think we got to know Doug well enough.

114
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,300
Wait, so would Doug have been shot instead of Carly in that one scene if we took him instead?

115
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,070
Nah, well, thank you so much for the video!

116
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,970
Thank you!

117
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,370
What the heck, thank you!

118
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,770
Playing 400 days in the other three seasons.

119
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,090
I don't know what that is.

120
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,330
But, oh, you mean of this game?

121
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,170
of the Walking Dead?

122
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,840
400 days is post-game DLC.

123
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

124
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,920
I see, I see, I see.

125
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,880
Give me them sweet tax breaks, Mickey.

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,440
Wait, do married people get tax breaks?

127
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,020
Wait, seriously?

128
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,460
Wait.

129
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:18,860
Wait.

130
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,660
Yes?

131
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,840
Wait.

132
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,440
That's why people get married.

133
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,080
I thought people got married because they liked each other.

134
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Wait!

135
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:38,860
What?

136
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh, if you have babies.

137
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm a ghost.

138
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,100
How would...

139
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,820
You know what?

140
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm not gonna think about it.

141
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,860
We never decided our wedding date.

142
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,200
Wait, don't forget about us.

143
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,440
Don't forget about me!

144
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,420
Orca!

145
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,620
I'm waiting, Orca!

146
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,220
Come on!

147
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,740
Okay.

148
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:24,120
tax breaks may not be the only reason i thought people got married because they liked each other they're doing it for the sweet cash oh my gosh

149
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,180
oh wow or you know um what's it called for like uh

150
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,660
For power.

151
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,700
You know, if you're like, oh, we must have our kingdoms unite.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,080
Hey, Mint, want to get some tax breaks together?

153
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,170
Political marriage, yeah.

154
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,330
Oh, wow.

155
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,110
I didn't know that.

156
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,910
Wait, you have to have a baby?

157
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,830
Or you would have you just say, I'm going to have one.

158
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,010
What if you just trick them?

159
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,990
You say, I'm going to have a baby.

160
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,210
You can file jointly if you're married and get a tax break, even with no kids!

161
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,350
Oh my gosh.

162
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,810
That's called tax fraud.

163
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,750
No, it's not.

164
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,840
How would you have babies?

165
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,760
Well, it's been 38 weeks since your Christmas karaoke, so in two more weeks.

166
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,580
Wait.

167
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh my gosh, wait.

168
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,660
Yeah, it's September.

169
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,160
It's September.

170
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:19,590
Guys, this is not the conversation we should be having before this very sad episode, About tax breaks and babies.

171
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,930
How do we talk about this again?

172
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,430
We talked about babies because of Crawford.

173
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,670
Lee, who?

174
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,430
We need the distraction.

175
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,170
Okay, that's fair.

176
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,150
This episode is not sad, surely.

177
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,310
It's going to be so fine.

178
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:48,450
I bet probably they will discover the cure for the dead, for the zombie disease right now.

179
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:57,270
And also And also, the next three seasons, it's four seasons, right?

180
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,490
The next three seasons will just be slice of life.

181
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,290
Guaranteed.

182
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,650
Duck and Kacha come back.

183
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,490
Yeah, actually, they weren't shot with real bullets.

184
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,450
It was...

185
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,860
I swallowed my spit rock.

186
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,090
They were just...

187
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,350
They were...

188
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,030
Paint bullets.

189
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,970
Which one hurts more?

190
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,230
Airsoft or...

191
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,670
Paint.

192
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,990
What's it called?

193
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,270
Uh...

194
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,990
Paintball.

195
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,530
Paintball by far?

196
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,830
Paintball?

197
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,570
More.

198
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,390
Paint hurts way more.

199
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,230
Well, yeah.

200
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,450
Depends on the PSI.

201
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,130
That makes sense.

202
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,990
Turns into a baseball sim as close.

203
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,110
Clem and Lee play catch for four games.

204
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,150
It'll be like an awesome...

205
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,430
It'll turn into like a shonen...

206
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,070
Not shonen.

207
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,310
Like a sports anime.

208
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:22,670
If he would save Doug, Lily would have aimed for Ben instead, but Doug would have jumped in front and took the bullet for him killing.

209
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,580
He's...

210
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,320
He's too good of a man!

211
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,700
We saved him from such a sad fate of protecting Ben!

212
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,040
You know what?

213
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,340
Doug!

214
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,400
Doug!

215
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,430
Alright, let's play the game.

216
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,790
Thank you guys for all this super chat.

217
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,750

218
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,990

I don't know how I feel about the new suit, but I really like it.

228
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,630
Shiyakusa!

229

Common Rider.

242
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,750

Oh.

246
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,040
I don't like that.

247
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,140
Played this game up to this chapter, then stopped.

248
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
Look forward to seeing how it all ends.

249
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,740
I guess we'll find out.

250
00:19:33,510 --> 00:20:02,850

255
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:11,910
Clementine!

256
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,020
Clementine's gone.

257
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,600
Wherever she is, I have to find her.

258
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,320
We have a better chance of finding her if we all go together.

259
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
Who's with me?

260
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,340
We'll look for Clementine together.

261
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,760
Thank you for the five gift advice.

262
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,360
Thank you.

263
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,760
What kind of friend would I be if I wasn't there for you now?

264
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,000
Maybe you should stay with the boat.

265
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,220
Okay, sure.

266
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,940
Quit?

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,160
Clementine.

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,160

I want you to never hurt anybody again.

279
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,580
This isn't a kidnapping, Lee.

280
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,560
I'm going to hurt you.

281
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,320

I knew it!

288
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
I knew it!

289
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,940
Ugh!

290
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,660
Hold on.

291
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,980
I'm coming for you, Clem!

292
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,040
Run.

293
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,000
Borrow time.

294
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,090
Looks an awful like, like, kidnapping.

295
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,970
I know, right?

296
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,770
Oh, don't look at it.

297
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,590
How's that feeling?

298
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,110
It tingles.

299
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,810
Uh, fine.

300
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,570
Fine.

301
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,230
Don't worry about it.

302
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,810
It wasn't a full chunk.

303
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,150
They will remember that.

304
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,790
It wasn't.

305
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,590
We don't have much time.

306
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,030
It wasn't a full chop.

307
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,430
What?

308
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,930
Why didn't you shut the door?

309
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,030
Okay, now you can shut the door.

310
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,290
We'll all make sure nothing gets in.

311
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,030
There you go.

312
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,410
Kenny...

313
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,430
Try to find another way out of here.

314
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,990
Okay, Kenny has some sense.

315
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,690
Oh, okay.

316
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,350
Let's look at the coolers.

317
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,050
It was a nibble.

318
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,810
Just a little.

319
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,570
Damn.

320
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,010
I was kind of hoping they dug some secret tunnels or something.

321
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,170
Crystal, you have a second?

322
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,930
We'll have time to chit chat later.

323
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,650
Okay, you're right.

324
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,050
Omid.

325
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,290
There's thousands of dead filling the sewers and God only knows how many up top, so...

326
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,830
Well, let them fill the sewers and then they can't get out, huh?

327
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,690
Can't those things let up for a fucking minute?

328
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,970
Just keep looking for another way out.

329
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,830
I got this.

330
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,690
Yeah, Leah is a professor.

331
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,310
That's so true.

332
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,930
I keep looking for a way out.

333
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,490
Yeah, get to it.

334
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,030
I am.

335
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,370
Okay.

336
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,650
Okay.

337
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,930
Anything over here?

338
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,230
Walking to, uh, operating table?

339
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,530
I can't.

340
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,790
Where the hell did they go?

341
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,310
Stop mumbling.

342
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,270
The zombies are so loud.

343
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,170
I can't hear anything.

344
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:09,810
Anything?

345
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,010
A key?

346
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:12,430
No.

347
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,310
Nothing?

348
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,570
Oh, what is that?

349
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,250
What is that?

350
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,970
A real?

351
00:24:21,710 --> 00:25:18,940
spreader looks like a car jack I don't want to imagine this being used on a body I like when I hear like one zombie really clearly he'll just be like just some surgical supplies interesting okay what's in this cabinet nothing okay oh the scale this is a I want to know how skinny I am I want to know how skinny I am look at the elevator hey I think I found a way out does it who's so who's who's talking over there chit-chatting up a storm open the elevator shoot the elevator yeah Exactly.

Okay.

354
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,440
Crank it.

355
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
I'll have these doors open in two seconds.

356
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:36,740
One.

357
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,080
Two.

358
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,000
I hope nobody's in there.

359
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,410
Are you okay?

360
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,370
Wait.

361
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,690
Oh, Lee?

362
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,750
Oh.

363
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,990
Lee?

364
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,120
Oh.

365
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,500
Oh.

366
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,240
Oh.

367
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,680
Oh.

368
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,370
It's not looking so good.

369
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,640
Fuck.

370
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,660
Is he alive?

371
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,580
Shit.

372
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:18,920
This is bad.

373
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,240
Hello.

374
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:24,940
Okay.

375
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,700
Maybe it's a tummy ache.

376
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,660
This has to be done.

377
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,840
No, no, no.

378
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

379
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,200
Wait, wait!

380
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,920
I'm awake!

381
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm awake!

382
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:34,620
Stop!

383
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,680
He's awake!

384
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,060
He's still bitten.

385
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:37,800
So?

386
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,200
This is about trying to save him.

387
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,140
At the very least, buy him some time.

388
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,720
Oh, wait, actually, yeah, do that.

389
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,200
Cut off my arm.

390
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,140
Do we know it works?

391
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,400
Okay, but it's, like, totally spread through my system now at this point.

392
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,020
We know there's going to be a lot of blood.

393
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,640
There's going to be a shitload of blood.

394
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,480
What if he dies?

395
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,260
Then the rest of us go after Clementine and get the hell out of Savannah.

396
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,940
Uh...

397
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,640
Damn right.

398
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:33,160
been way too long if there's a chance it stops you from turning uh we have to take it i don't know oh i missed my chance sorry what do you think i think it's been way too long we leave it we leave it are you sure yeah i feel like i got time just keep an eye on me i get my hands there's no way that it's not entirely in my system like come on you're gonna die yeah But not in here.

399
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,140
You guys keep an eye on that door.

400
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,180
I'll work on getting us out of here.

401
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,560
We?

402
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,160
No.

403
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,580
This is what we're doing, and I don't want to hear anything else, okay?

404
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,340
But also, I don't want to be an injured man.

405
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,540
They'll smell my blood.

406
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Like, there's...

407
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,860
We've already established that they could smell that, no?

408
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,960
Like, it would be so stupid to cut off my arm.

409
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,580
Am I still doing this?

410
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,220
And we'll be weak?

411
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,220
It'll be so stupid!

412
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,120
Hey!

413
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,240
We did it.

414
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,790
All right.

415
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,650
Up we go.

416
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,990
We're gonna have to go as quiet as possible and see if we can make it to an empty floor or even the roof.

417
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:29,930
Sounds good.

418
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,430
Oh.

419
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,230
Scary.

420
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,110
Liquid's dog's arms.

421
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,430
Everybody has a replacement.

422
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,570
There's some light up there.

423
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,110
Good.

424
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,170
Gotta get my ass off this ladder.

425
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,530
With darkness and silence.

426
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,150
What?

427
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:54,630
What?

428
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,010
What was it?

429
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,830
Night.

430
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,110
What a thrill.

431
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,830
Why did we stop?

432
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:04,610
Oh.

433
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,130
Watch out!

434
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,270
That was fucking close.

435
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,770
Everything okay up there?

436
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,070
Oh, just fucking peachy.

437
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,290
Oh, I'm still moving.

438
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,130
I'm searching and I'm melting to you.

439
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,930
I'm still going.

440
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,710
What a fear in my heart.

441
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,750
No!

442
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,250
Oh, this is so bad.

443
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,170
Lee!

444
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,690
Oh, God.

445
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:36,910
Are you alive?

446
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,970
Get up!

447
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,070
Ah!

448
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,150
Ah!

449
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,610
Ah!

450
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,430
I'm alive.

451
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,050
You have to pull yourself up.

452
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,250
I got it.

453
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:54,970
I got this.

454
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,090
It's just a sit-up.

455
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,270
It's just a sit-up.

456
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,030
We got this.

457
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,190
Let's go.

458
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,490
Good job.

459
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,330
How?

460
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,690
Oh my gosh.

461
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,070
How did his legs lock like that?

462
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,370
Crunch time.

463
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:08,750
Yeah.

464
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,400
Wow, that's a really cool visual.

465
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,840
Wait, that's...

466
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,960
Why are there so many?

467
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,720
Yeah, that would have been way harder with one arm, huh?

468
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,560
Us losing blood?

469
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,220
No help.

470
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,500
Yeah, it was a hospital, so this place is...

471
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,700
When they were like, we need to find an empty floor, I was like, in a hospital?

472
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,100
You got that zombie strength.

473
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,080
Remember when Savannah was empty?

474
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,040
And the zombie speed.

475
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,340
Those Crawford bastards did.

476
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:55,660
one thing right I guess yeah there must be thousands of them they didn't follow no out today it sure seems like it that's crazy they can't track they just roam is it that fucking train wasn't exactly Clementine's out there Clementine's out there somewhere gobbled up in all of that we'll get to her Lee we'll do whatever we have to look let's get our bearings and see if we can figure out a way to town good good i don't think we can ignore what just happened to lee oh that he's he's right he's right i was showing off i'm gonna be honest it's the bite just have to deal with it you gotta let us know if you start feeling funny you know i know it's just dissonance that's all i'm all good new fan as you can yeah good as i can be I'm thinking about it,

477
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,320
but I'm really enjoying this one.

478
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,020
Right, pal?

479
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,560
Now, let's get our bearings.

480
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,280
You're the bell tower.

481
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,340
You distract them all with that, right?

482
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,040
Yeah, don't do it.

483
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,800
All the paint.

484
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,140
Like Molly did, yeah.

485
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,680
Some poor bastard took a spill.

486
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,180
Yeah, looks like whoever was up here painting that sign went ass over tea kettle.

487
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, poor guy.

488
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,760
It's an extension ladder.

489
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,940
That might be helpful for the...

490
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,220
The bell.

491
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,380
Oh, I know.

492
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,220
Oh, okay.

493
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,280
Okay, I was stuck on...

494
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,640
Oh.

495
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,420
He or she walked away from whatever accident happened.

496
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,920
Well, that doesn't really mean much.

497
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:26,840
oh oh gosh so they fell and then they were covered in oh gosh oh that's pretty bad canny that looks like Crawford Square over there fuck that place yeah did fix up our boat though we get Clementine and get right back make sure she wears her life jacket okay something tells me she's not gonna Oh,

498
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,940
we're not going on the boat!

499
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,240
Oh!

500
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,360
I think my thing is bugged.

501
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,220
Wait, it keeps saying look at footprints.

502
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,220
Okay, now it's changed.

503
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,840
I bet that hurt like hell.

504
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,040
Okay, there we go.

505
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,320
Because it just kept saying look at footprints.

506
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,700
Krista!

507
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,340
That's the church across the street from the mansion.

508
00:34:02,920 --> 00:35:26,320
River Street should be just beyond that we need to head back that way we'll stop off at the mansion like you said and make sure we didn't overlook anything I think we've checked everything in that house like a billion times I think we've checked that spot that house like we've we have really picked it clean I think I think there's nothing left what's up over here Bell Tower that's what's up yeah that could help when I'm bod gang I'm going to see if I can sing all of snake eater during that part would be funny if the developers did that okay so let's go get the ladder right right hey hey oh oh there's more how's the leg how's the leg it's doing a lot better thanks for going into Crawford for me even if it wasn't for me Clementine too she's tough as hell oh me's nice yeah everybody's gonna die shit about her okay legs oh wow that's way further than I thought it was wait that's a pretty big gap I'll see if we can make it out to that bail tower okay be careful though I don't want you going

Anything over here?

512
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,360
Honestly, my vision isn't great.

513
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,020
I think it's allergies or all that shit those walkers are kicking up.

514
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,680
Oh no.

515
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,640
Allergies, that's funny.

516
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,200
How's that funny?

517
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,120
People used to get those.

518
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,840
People still get those.

519
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,380
You never see anybody in an end of the world story with pay fever.

520
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,360
It's not the time to get wistful.

521
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,180
I know.

522
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,180
It's this deal with Clem.

523
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,120
It's everything.

524
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Put Ui-sensei's stance.

525
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,020
Just put this rage inside me like I can't even say.

526
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,480
I used to get allergies too, and just...

527
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:40,840
Fuck.

528
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,180
Who was that guy?

529
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,920
Someone with priorities?

530
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,400
Any thoughts about the herd?

531
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,320
Got any good ideas for getting through that, uh, herd?

532
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm working on it.

533
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,240
Are you gonna be able to hang in there?

534
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,360

I'm hanging.

536
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,060
There's a bell tower.

537
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,800
The mansion's that way.

538
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,300
Yeah.

539
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:47,900

Kenny is a strong-headed character, but he does not seem to be a bad character, you know?

544
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
Game is infected.

545
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,420
Oh, my gosh.

546
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,080
Okay.

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,960
All right.

548
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,520
The bells.

549
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,940
The bells.

550
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,240
Could buy us some time.

551
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,240
Draw as many as we can this way.

552
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,680
Get down off the roof on the opposite side and bust our asses getting back to the mansion.

553
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,200
You think you should be the one to go?

554
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:22,080
my leg's feeling better let me do it oh man we have to decide who takes a risk like this it should be the guy who's got the least to lose what's the worst that could happen I get bitten again

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,420
hurry okay yeah what she said it should be fine I'm going.

557
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,660
Climb to the bell tower.

558
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
What's the worst that can happen?

559
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,460
This seems pretty sturdy, no?

560
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,660
Oh, I lied.

561
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,940
I lied, I lied.

562
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,760
No one's holding the ladder.

563
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,700
Holy shit, man.

564
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,920
Are you okay?

565
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,340
Um...

566
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,680
Yeah.

567
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,020
I'm fine.

568
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,520
Try to find another way out of there?

569
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,380
I jinxed it.

570
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,580
A few solid rings of this, and there'll be thousands down below.

571
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,200
But that's the only way we can get out!

572
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,100
Why wouldn't anyone hold it?

573
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,500
It wouldn't have fallen.

574
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,680
It wouldn't have fallen if somebody was holding it.

575
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,040
Like, it might have broke still, but it wouldn't have dropped to the ground.

576
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,080
Oh, no.

577
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,740
No, no.

578
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,130
It's locked.

579
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:40,750
Shit.

580
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,990
The exit in here's locked.

581
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,130
Uh-oh.

582
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,030
Um.

583
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,540
Uh.

584
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,720
All moonwalk?

585
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,220
Alright, let's pull the rope.

586
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,820
Oh, my ears.

587
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,880
I wonder where Molly went.

588
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,120
I guess she left, left, but like, where'd she go?

589
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,520
It was like when everyone was just standing around.

590
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,500
They're coming this way.

591
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,320
He was beating up the one guy.

592
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,280
Tons of them.

593
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,180
Jesus.

594
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,100
Now get back here.

595
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,100
How?

596
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,980
You gonna catch me in your arms?

597
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,660
Oh, big boy.

598
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,960
The ladder's down there!

599
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,990
I think I have to jump.

600
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,150
There's no way back.

601
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,570
You can make it.

602
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,590
It ain't that far.

603
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,890
You got this.

604
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,230
You got this, motherfucker.

605
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,470
Yeah, pep talk, pep talk.

606
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,550
Alright.

607
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,590
What does that mean?

608
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,030
Oh.

609
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,470
Kenny!

610
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,830
I'm gonna jump into your arms.

611
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,670
Don't look down!

612
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,090
Oh, don't look...

613
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,290
Why would you say that?

614
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:06,670
You got it, Lee!

615
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,790
Why would you say that?

616
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,430
Here I go!

617
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,320
Kenny, catch me in your big, strong arms!

618
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:29,040
Not a single person to help him up.

619
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,380
Good goddamn leap, pal.

620
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,720
Wow, okay.

621
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:50,820

No, shit, it's gone.

625
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,660
Ben, what happened?

626
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,120
They were waiting for me in here.

627
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,040
Vernon, his whole crew.

628
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,240
Yes, Clementine with them?

629
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,740
No.

630
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,180
He seemed pissed you guys lost her, and...

631
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,580
Well, they took it.

632
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,700
They're gone.

633
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,860
Ben, you are worthless.

634
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,020
How's Lee feeling?

635
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,260
Don't change the subject.

636
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,340
Oh.

637
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,360
I can't believe you didn't even put up a fight.

638
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,180
Oh.

639
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,300
Wow, they took the boat.

640
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,080
Oh, Mead, can you go over the fence and let us into the backyard?

641
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,960
You shouldn't be out in the open.

642
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,460
Yeah.

643
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,740
I can't believe Vernon's crew took the boat.

644
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,700
This is not happening.

645
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,400
Everything is so fucked.

646
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,180
Clementine is still out there.

647
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,300
So we get Clementine and then what?

648
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,560
Yeah.

649
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,800
We get the fuck out of cities.

650
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,220
I'm done with cities.

651
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,860
We go into the countryside and make a go of it.

652
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,920
Yeah, that seems like a good idea to me.

653
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,240
This is so bad.

654
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,880
You just did.

655
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,520
Don't get fucking smart with me, Ben.

656
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,300
Tell.

657
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:52,920
remember we had a boat a boat let's just get over it everyone keep it together get over it then I mean immediately we stay the course don't turn on each other yeah chill out Kenny chill out Kenny I should have killed him Ben I swear to God what do we do without a boat um get another Fuck,

658
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,320
get to the countryside maybe?

659
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,180
Get to the countryside.

660
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,240
Dicked around with cities and coastlines and boats too long.

661
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,320
Yeah, if we're a boat, where do we go for that too, you know?

662
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,000
Like, I never really kind of understood the plan.

663
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,840
I agree with you.

664
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,700
I think out in the country is the safest place to be.

665
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,200
We'll get over it.

666
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,320
But you're not dead yet.

667
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,800
So put a pin in that, okay?

668
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,960
Where the hell do you get off?

669
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,200
I'm just saying we should all chill.

670
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,380
Not just you.

671
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,660
Chill?

672
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,140
Bandits?

673
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,140
Hey, chill!

674
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
Here's some pills.

675
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,620
Vernon, chill.

676
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,060
Here's our fucking boat.

677
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,260
This isn't my fault.

678
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,960
I can't point to one thing that's happened that isn't somehow your fault.

679
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, tell him.

680
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,700
Lee should have left you and Crawford.

681
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,720
Oh, you, Kenny.

682
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,860
Oh, whoa, Ben.

683
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,880
Whoa, Ben.

684
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,800
No, let him.

685
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,340
Oh, what?

686
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,240
I am so, so, so sorry about Kachi.

687
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,260
Why are we letting Ben go off of Kenny?

688
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,340
And I know I fucked up, but stop pushing me around.

689
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,580
and stop wishing I was dead.

690
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,120
Then give me a reason to wish you were alive!

691
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,240
You said goodbye.

692
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,080
I never got to see my family.

693
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,860
My parents, my little sister.

694
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,760
Do you get that?

695
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,140
Your family is gone, but at least you had them to lose.

696
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,300
I never made it home.

697
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,560
They could be alive or dead or walkers or worse, and I don't know.

698
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,040
So give me a fucking break!

699
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,160
Oh, Ben.

700
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,160
Oh.

701
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,760
Oh, shit.

702
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,400
Here they come.

703
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,080
Here they come, Ben.

704
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,840
I get that Ben's a teenager.

705
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,580
They shouldn't be able to get into the backyard, right?

706
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,700
I get that, Ben.

707
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,460
Maybe not.

708
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,060
We can secure this place.

709
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,100
It's a teenager, but he...

710
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,960
Weapons.

711
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,040
Search the house for weapons.

712
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Wait, that was a terrible...

713
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,040
There is nothing...

714
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,660
Wait, there's...

715
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:45,940
Kenny.

716
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,620
Kenny, move furniture.

717
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,140
Move anything you can up against the doors and windows.

718
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,420
That's what I was thinking.

719
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,400
But he's...

720
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,880
Oh, uh...

721
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,480
Kill anything...

722
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,680
Kill anything that gets in.

723
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,680
You know you're talking to me, right?

724
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,540
Ben, just do it.

725
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,260
He needs to prove himself!

726
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:02,920
Omid?

727
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,100
What is it?

728
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:04,620
Omid?

729
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,820
Oh, shoot.

730
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:07,800
Front doors!

731
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,180
Front doors!

732
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,320
Oh, that's the sickest dog door!

733
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,020
Oh, my gosh.

734
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,120
Lee, help!

735
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,340
Cut the fucking arm.

736
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,320
Oh.

737
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,900
There's gotta be a knife or something in there.

738
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,540
A knife?

739
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
Wait, where'd the dog food go?

740
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,460
Uh, drawer?

741
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,340
Nothing.

742
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,300
Drawer?

743
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:33,740
Knife.

744
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,280
Oh!

745
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,160
That's, that's handy.

746
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,620
Take your goddamn arms off!

747
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,520
Yeah!

748
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,080
Watch your, watch your fingers!

749
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,180
Oh, come on.

750
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,560
That, that it?

751
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:46,760
Oh.

752
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,560
Okay, that was close.

753
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,380
Now what?

754
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:51,600
Okay.

755
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,560
Uh, get ready to fight.

756
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,300
Get ready to fight.

757
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,040
This place seems sturdy to me.

758
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,880
I think we're fine.

759
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,780
Good job, Krista.

760
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:03,620
Krista.

761
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,340
Krista.

762
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,180
Sturdy my ass.

763
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,140
Get up there!

764
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,480
Go!

765
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,480
No way!

766
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,440
It's Bree!

767
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,580
No!

768
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,980
Guys, help me with this!

769
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:30,660
how'd she get all the way here oh again

770
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:53,280
everyone get to the end of the hallway oh no more what do we do now this will fall down we're working on it the end of the hallway and take a fucking stand why are there so many many as we can.

771
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,760
When we see an opening, we go for it.

772
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,280
Left for dead moment.

773
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Yeah.

774
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,080
Three.

775
00:49:59,540 --> 00:49:59,860
Three.

776
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Five.

777
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,140
Four.

778
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:01,860
Two.

779
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,720
One.

780
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Oh.

781
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,740
Hello?

782
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,380
Is it me?

783
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,980
I'll get him.

784
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,540
Uh, is anyone else gonna shoot?

785
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,800
Is anyone else gonna shoot?

786
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,520
Is that... Okay, nice.

787
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,660
Is anyone else gonna shoot?

788
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,880
Oh, I'm out?

789
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm out!

790
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,200
Me too!

791
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,560
Uh-oh.

792
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Fuck!

793
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,000
Where do we go?

794
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,720
There's no goddamn opening!

795
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,860
Oh!

796
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,580
Go!

797
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:44,880
Go!

798
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,200
Go!

799
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Go!

800
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,320
Team, go!

801
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,440
Oh, no.

802
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,840
Okay, Ben, pull it up.

803
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,640
Good job.

804
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,240

808
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,400
We don't need to talk about it.

809
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,380
Oops, I tried to do it.

810
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,700
We're still reading them.

811
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,660
I'm not advocating anything here.

812
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,140
But how is this not a thing?

813
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,340
We're also worked up about Clementine that we're forgetting what the fuck happened to you.

814
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,200
My arm is...

815
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,300
My arm is not the issue.

816
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,560
I'm not the problem.

817
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:07,060
The 500 walkers in the house and no door in this room are the goddamn problems.

818
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,420
Yeah.

819
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,520
Maybe at the moment.

820
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,520
But who's to say when it becomes an issue?

821
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,540
At that point, there may not be any time left to deal with it.

822
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:45,320
is bloodthirsty you're gonna listen to me we will get clementine back with or without you because i haven't given up everything to die because we were stupid i'm sorry okay fuck we can't do this we're gonna have to what why am i taking this oh you ruined that dude's face shut up sweetie look There's another room.

823
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,600
It's corroded to hell.

824
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,180
What's on the other side of this wall?

825
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,520
A 30-foot drop?

826
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,120
No.

827
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,740
Wait, what is this?

828
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,920
This mansion butts up against the one next door.

829
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,420
I'll be damned.

830
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,470
This wall ain't shit.

831
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,850
Is this really possible?

832
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,590
Corroded.

833
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,050
Right?

834
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,070
Wouldn't it be like, what, dry-rodded instead?

835
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,890
Maybe not corroded.

836
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,530
I'm not a carpenter, though.

837
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:16,950
Okay.

838
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,050
You can't call me Sabrina.

839
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,470
Krista and I.

840
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,830
Lee, you rest.

841
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,590
We have to work fast.

842
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,670
I wasn't going to hurt you.

843
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,050
I want him to still be my friend.

844
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:32,490
Sure, pal.

845
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,510
I know.

846
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:41,670
One thing I do like about Kenny is he can dish it and he can also take it.

847
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,750
Like he's pretty forgiving for the most part.

848
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,350
I'm glad you told us when you got bitten.

849
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,550
It would have been easy not to.

850
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:50,970
Yeah.

851
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:52,230
Well.

852
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,590
You probably would have let you go alone if you hadn't told us.

853
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,110
Which would have been a mistake.

854
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,630
If I were you, I would have been scared shitless.

855
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:01,710
Um.

856
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,530
If you were me, you'd be a foot taller.

857
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,110
If you were me, you'd be a foot taller.

858
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,510
Hey.

859
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,770
And about 50 pounds heavier.

860
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,510
Wouldn't get scared as much.

861
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,350
With your arm and my leg.

862
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,150
I'll cripple fight you right here, buddy.

863
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:27,870

864
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:39,240
like it's asleep tingly i don't think it would have mattered what do you think

865
00:56:42,800 --> 00:57:46,600
um we just get clementine we're just gonna get her despite how i feel i i can't let vengeance be sure but if it's not that easy we'll do whatever it takes and you know whatever happens to you seriously can we not talk like that I think it's the entire time we're at the hospital I could sense you think you're as good as dead I'm bitten Krista we all know that's a wrap yeah there's gotta be something the cure will happen in five seconds i want you guys to take her oh wait he means them to take oh the two of them no i meant like i'm serious she'd be safe and relatively happy with you too we're not doing this oh christine listen to him i thought they meant the group okay wait how about him uh what he um he'll figure it out What do you mean by that?

866
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,400
You either get his act together or something will happen to him.

867
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:50,740
Yeah.

868
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,540
That's it?

869
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,000
What else is there to say?

870
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,760
You lose his shit like that often?

871
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:55,700
No.

872
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,100
That was a first.

873
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,440
It's good that he did.

874
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,400
Kenny couldn't pull that shit on me.

875
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,700
The kid killed Kenny's family!

876
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,000
The kid killed his family.

877
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,600
So there's been some tension.

878
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,180
Yeah!

879
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:07,740
Really?

880
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,540
I think, um, he has a very valid reason to not like Ben.

881
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,740
Kenny's son got bitten during a raid by some gang that Ben was secretly helping.

882
00:58:14,760 --> 00:59:16,020

00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,360
Anyway, I appreciate it for both of you.

884
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:20,860
Aw.

885
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,180
A lot of us have lost families.

886
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,920
Some of us for reasons of people sitting in the room.

887
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,780
You're right to hate him.

888
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,920
I'm fueling the fire.

889
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,080
What good's it doing?

890
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm not getting them back.

891
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,100
Everybody stares at him?

892
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,120
He's having a rough go.

893
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,080
Yeah.

894
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,180
Yeah, we all are!

895
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,480
I just...

896
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,000
Ugh!

897
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,780
What's that?

898
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,420
Juice?

899
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,660
This guy tell you much about what we've been through?

900
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:57,740
Bits and pieces.

901
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,840
Well, he can't fight for shit.

902
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,020
Well, look at him.

903
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,120
Hey!

904
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,240
What are you talking about?

905
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,940
Like you guys didn't have enough problems without punching each other in the face.

906
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,900
Yeah, he had to knock some scents into me before we met you on the train.

907
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,220
Clean and pristine his...

908
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,740
Why is?

909
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,400
Oh, wait, what do you say?

910
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:16,980
Uh...

911
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,280
After everything, you're still a bastard, don't you?

912
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,740
Been hearing that my whole life, Doc.

913
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,920
Well, that's how you know we're buddies.

914
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,960
I call him a bastard.

915
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,060
Cheers!

916
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,640
Save's Ben last time, so...

917
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:31,960
Yeah.

918
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,480
This, the alcohol will clean my system.

919
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,590
Oh, the baby.

920
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,050
Oh.

921
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,760
Don't- don't pressure her to drink.

922
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:47,730
Oh!

923
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,390
I'm through!

924
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,090
Well?

925
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,630
No walkers.

926
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,710
Things are looking up.

927
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:06,510
Yahoo!

928
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,430
Everyone keep a goddamn eye out.

929
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,980
Be your old clock, baby.

930
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,040
This place seems pretty sealed off.

931
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,240
Well.

932
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:28,960
Oh!

933
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,500
Oh.

934
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,380
Wait.

935
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,440
Oh.

936
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,220
Um, let's keep moving.

937
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,660
What do you mean how could they do this?

938
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,400
I think...

939
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,620
Yeah.

940
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,260
There's an apocalypse.

941
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,240
There's so many people.

942
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,020
I don't know why these ones break my heart.

943
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,980
How did we not go into this room before?

944
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,200
It's not giving yourself a chance.

945
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,340
It's what Kacha did.

946
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,520
Oh.

947
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,640
I'm sorry, Kim.

948
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,620
Yeah, get the gun.

949
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Take the gun.

950
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:15,520
Take the gun.

951
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,600
She left me.

952
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,340
My son.

953
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,300
People that cared about us.

954
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,520
I forgive her, but it don't make it any less wrong.

955
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,600
You don't just end it because it's hard.

956
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,980
You stick it out and you help the folks you care about.

957
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,420
So let's figure a way out of here and get that little girl.

958
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,280
Yeah, think about Clementine.

959
01:02:38,480 --> 01:03:05,180
Clementine got at least one shot left oh nice Kenny has some sense before we move on Lee figure out where we're headed I mean look on his face he looks content to me yeah let's keep at it I'm trying to try to lighten the moon you guys

960
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,360
Hard to believe the world once felt this peaceful.

961
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,040
Oh, Ben.

962
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,620
What do you got to say for yourself?

963
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:18,560
You still with a spit?

964
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,640
You still with a spit?

965
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,140
Yeah, Lee.

966
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,040
Nah, welcome to membership.

967
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:22,760
Thank you.

968
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,080
You okay?

969
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:24,780
You still with a spit?

970
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,340
Yeah, Lee.

971
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,200
I just want to help.

972
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,740
That's what he always says.

973
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,880
Shoshia, thank you so much for the 50 gifts.

974
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:33,600
Thank you.

975
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,240
Thank you.

976
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,500
Thank you.

977
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,480
What do you call this thing?

978
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,120
What do you call?

979
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,700
Why did he make that face?

980
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,270
Thank you so so much!

981
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,430
It's sick, but...

982
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,190
Think of all the pain they avoided.

983
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:56,770
Hmm...

984
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,110
Krista?

985
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:59,870
I guess Crawford would have gotten them anyway.

986
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,850
What they have?

987
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:05,090
They look able... They look like they're young and...

988
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,350
I actually can't tell.

989
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,250
Don't ask me how I'm doing.

990
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:15,890
keep going they don't look like they would have been thrown out but who knows what their criteria was

991
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:42,940

oh, wait, this is good.

993
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,880
Nothing other than personal items in here.

994
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,260
Not even a snack.

995
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,540
No chocolate under the undies.

996
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,280
Looks like we can stay off the streets all the way to River Street if we're careful.

997
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:58,920
Let's go.

998
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,280
Go ahead.

999
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh, okay.

1000
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,420
I'll go first.

1001
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,370
You guys don't hide stuff underneath your panties?

1002
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,570
I want Sith candy.

1003
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,390

01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,650
my whole house.

1005
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:34,280
Uh-oh.

1006
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:34,660
Wait.

1007
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,640
Who hasn't jumped?

1008
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:39,700
Okay.

1009
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:40,940
Don't wait, Ben.

1010
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,140
No, kidding.

1011
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,040
No way.

1012
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,100
Wait, where is... Oh, there he is.

1013
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,880
Is he alive?

1014
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,460
Me and my fucking mouth.

1015
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,100
Wait.

1016
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,000
Holy fuck.

1017
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,580
What are we gonna do?

1018
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,160
Gravity is a deadly...

1019
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,100
Is he alive?

1020
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,360
Kenny.

1021
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,520
Uh, keep a lookout.

1022
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,700
Stay up here.

1023
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:08,820
Keep an eye out.

1024
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,920
Okay, but I can't see much from up here.

1025
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,220
Just let us know if they start coming down the alley.

1026
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,700
We'll be back.

1027
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,540

1028
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:16,560
Be.

1029
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,460
Careful.

01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,240
Ants in my pants.

What happened?

1059
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,590
Um, weren't you on lookout?

1060
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:29,830
You should know.

1061
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,110
I tried.

1062
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:44,570
They're gone.

1063
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,080
Ben was not making an eye.

1064
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,100
Ben was...

1065
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,440
Damn!

1066
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,300
Why, Kenny?

1067
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,080
Why?

1068
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:56,940
Why, Kenny?

1069
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,920
Kenny!

1070
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,960
I heard a shot.

1071
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,540
Why didn't he just shoot Ben and go?

1072
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,780
Kenny made sure that Ben didn't feel any more pain than he had to.

1073
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,640
Oh, over Ben.

1074
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,220
What?

1075
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,560
It was Ben's biggest fear you know Kenny had one bulletin.

1076
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,900
That's how he used it God poor fucking kid

1077
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:49,230
You saw them die Nobody was getting out of there What I'm sorry, Lee Maybe he got he wasn't a bad guy who we talking about here?

1078
01:10:49,890 --> 01:11:13,330
Wasn't a bad guy Kenyon a lot of folks might not have always agreed even me they will remember that we should go right behind you over bed

1079
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,360
over bed

1080
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:35,940
our friend do you want to talk our friend Kenny was my friend!

1081
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,160
Kenny was my friend.

1082
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,040
Soon as someone dies, they don't immediately have to have their sins forgiven.

1083
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,940
What does that mean?

1084
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:42,220
What?

1085
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,660
I understand.

1086
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:45,880
Look, Lee.

1087
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,600
This is a shitty time.

1088
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,600
But I want to clear something up.

1089
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,280
What?

1090
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,760
Now with Kenny, gone.

1091
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,220
Means... Oh, Mead and I have to stay safe.

1092
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,300
For her.

1093
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,360
Yeah.

1094
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,720
Uh, yeah.

1095
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,400
Yeah, you do.

1096
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,020
Let me take all the risks.

1097
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,380
That's not what I mean, necessarily.

1098
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,740
It's what I mean.

1099
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,820
It's what we gotta do.

1100
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,080
Oh, this looks...

1101
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,720
Be careful across here.

1102
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,280
This doesn't look very safe?

1103
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,320
Who built this?

1104
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,240
Oh, golly.

1105
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,620
That's a far drop.

1106
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,460
Okay.

1107
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,600
I'm ready for the QT.

1108
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,360
Oh, gosh.

1109
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,800
Oh, gosh.

1110
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,280
Oh, hi.

1111
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:38,900
Oh,

1112
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,880
I don't like to know.

1113
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,400
I'm not afraid of heights, but this makes me a little uneasy.

1114
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:48,940
Oh, okay.

1115
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:49,740
Nothing bad happening.

1116
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,680
It's surprising.

1117
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,680
Whoa, careful.

1118
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,600
What's going on in there?

1119
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,020
The buildings are full.

1120
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:02,740
Oh, my gosh.

1121
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,940
I know where the next meal is.

1122
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:16,700

1124
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,180
Marshal's hotel is around the corner of the block.

1125
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,860
Yeah, that's it.

1126
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,000
We have to cross here.

1127
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,080
Oh.

1128
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,400
At least it doesn't look like a death trap.

1129
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:51,720
Oh.

1130
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,280
Oh, meh.

1131
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,360

Goose, going first.

1133
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,360
You're the lightest.

1134
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,140
He's got a busted leg and you're walking for two.

1135
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:02,780
Oh!

1136
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,100
Wait, so he does know!

1137
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:05,980
Wait!

1138
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,120

1141
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,570
Just go nice and slow.

1142
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,050
I like how we still have the cleaver on us.

1143
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:48,650
That's pretty nice.

1144
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,690
Oh, when do you think this was built?

1145
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,350
In like the 1400s.

1146
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,190
The 1900s.

1147
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,390
It's an easy crossing.

1148
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:08,890
Is it?

1149
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,420
You should have gone on the other side where the balcony is, right?

1150
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,080
I'm blocking it with my head, but...

Wait, so is he going to...

1154

Clam or...

1155

You think the zombies won't bother me because I'm already bit?

1156
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:43,170
Oh.

1157
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,270

What's the idea here?

1160
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,210
Lee, I'm scared.

1161
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,550
Don't do it.

1162
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,330
What a badass!

1163
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,970
Yeah, baby!

1164
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,710
She's too cool!

1165
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,600
Ripa die!

1166
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:43,800
Oh,

1167
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:47,580

1168
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,940
Holy!

1169
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,400
Oh my gosh!

1170
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:01,720
Clean.

1171
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,500
Now, thank you so much for the story!

1172
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,380
Where did I go?

1173
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,740
Oh, wow!

1174
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,800
Do I recognize the car?

1175
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,940
Was it the one we stole from?

1176
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,940
That I didn't steal from.

1177
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,440
But others did.

1178
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,720
It's really quiet in here.

1179
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,680
That was some nice ripping and tearing.

1180
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:35,720
Thanks, Doomguy!

1181
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,610
walking.

1182
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:56,190
It could be a zombie, but I didn't hear zombie noises.

1183
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,130
Oh.

1184
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,710
Happy birthday, Nome King.

1185
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:16,680
Ask me later, and I'll try and give some things.

1186
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,240
Though I don't know Ikebukuro very well.

1187
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,020
Oh!

1188
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:26,840
Hello?

1189
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,400
I got us adjoining rooms.

1190
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,200
Uh, where is she?

1191
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,220
Where is she?

1192
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,480
I already told you she's fine.

1193
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,120
Why does he look like Norman Bates?

1194
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,180
You look horrible.

1195
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,980
Go over there.

1196
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,800
Um, I just dual wielded glass.

1197
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,040
Put your things down.

1198
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,380
Let me out.

1199
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,040
Who's out there?

1200
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,620
Clem!

1201
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:00,900
Shh!

1202
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:07,730
Quiet, please, sweetie.

1203
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:11,090
Your things.

1204
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:12,210
There.

1205
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,500
I don't have anything.

1206
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:23,960
I don't have anything on me.

1207
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:24,880
Really.

1208
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,200
You got all the way here without any weapons.

1209
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,180
I lost them.

1210
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,880
I don't believe you.

1211
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,380
Oh, he's gonna hate me now.

1212
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:35,820
Seriously!

1213
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:36,620
Seriously.

1214
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,160
You don't believe me?

1215
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:39,400
Go ahead.

1216
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,020

1221
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,900
That asshole in the ball cap.

1222
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,480
His stupid fucking wife.

1223
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,280
I could have earned her trust back if they hadn't made our situation so desperate.

1224
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,300
Well, how'd you know it was us?

1225
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,320
We'll be empathetic.

1226
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,080
I'm sorry.

1227
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,620
The hungrier we got, the more she blamed me.

1228
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,480
We're trying to get Claire.

1229
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:29,020
until she finally took our daughter Elizabeth and left okay they didn't get far I found them a day later a day in the road do I look like a monster to you yeah kind of um we all do we all do some more than others oh you gonna you Are you gonna say you look worse than me?

1230
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,700
Or I look worse than you?

1231
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:34,140
You killed a man with a pitchfork right in front of a little girl.

1232
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,320
Uh, I protected her.

1233
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,700
I did what I had to.

1234
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,460
You abandoned a defenseless, grieving woman.

1235
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,260
She deserved it.

1236
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,220
You weren't there.

1237
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,440
You weren't there.

1238
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:52,120
You brought her to the most dangerous place in this city where she could have died.

1239
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:53,780
Uh.

1240
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,640
That's not the whole story.

1241
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,000
Yeah, this guy...

1242
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,440
The whole story?

1243
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:07,320
This guy is, like, trying to be a therapist, judging our actions throughout the game.

1244
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,220
How could you know all this?

1245
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,880
Yeah, he only knows 50% of the story.

1246
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,600
The iDroid.

1247
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,020
You're a monster.

1248
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,040
You're a murderer and a thief.

1249
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,140
And I'm gonna hurt you so bad.

1250
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,300
Oh, don't threaten me with a good time.

1251
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,520
I didn't steal from you!

1252
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,780
I didn't steal from you!

1253
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,340
But think of everything else you did.

1254
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,600
For survival!

1255
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,520
Clementine on my radio.

1256
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,780
I wasn't even mad at you.

1257
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,700
I was coming for the others.

1258
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,100
For revenge.

1259
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,860
Go after them then!

1260
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,280
The things you did.

1261
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,580
Clementine is...

1262
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,760
Clementine...

1263
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,140
Girl, what are you telling people about me?

1264
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,920
This before what happens next.

1265
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,680
I can take care of her.

1266
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,000
We can have a family.

1267
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,400
Oh, like you took care of your son, huh?

1268
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,480
I bet you don't even know how old she is.

1269
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,800
Isn't she seven?

1270
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,320
She's eight.

1271
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,140
Wrong.

1272
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:16,880
What?

1273
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:18,620
She's nine.

1274
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,860
But her birthday was six days ago.

1275
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,180
Oh, well, um...

1276
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,760
I know how to be a dad, you know.

1277
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:29,200
She wouldn't be exposed to what she has.

1278
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,800
I was wrong completely.

1279
01:26:33,380 --> 01:27:02,280

1280
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,040
School days?

1281
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,060
I'm glad too.

1282
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:06,720
Nice.

1283
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:14,570
I wish you wouldn't have had to get this bad, but it's all over, hun.

1284
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,830
Isn't it?

1285
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:17,770
Just about.

1286
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:19,950
I hate seeing you like this.

1287
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,990
I just miss your smile, honey.

1288
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,370
It's school days!

1289
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:26,850
I miss you so much, Tess.

1290
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,210
You're gonna like Clementine a lot, though.

1291
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,310
She's not Lizzie, but she's sweet.

1292
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,910
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1293
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:35,570
Yeah!

1294
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:39,990
Uh-oh.

1295
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,010
He's fast.

1296
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,570
Oh, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q.

1297
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,050
Oh, gosh.

1298
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:45,450
Hey!

1299
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,210
Oh, oh, oh!

1300
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:51,150
Oh, oh.

1301
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,010
Oh, oh, oh!

1302
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,160
I'm cueing, I'm queuing, I'm queuing, I'm queuing, I'm queuing, and nothing's happening.

1303
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:03,660
Oh, my gosh.

1304
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,380
It's the slowest.

1305
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,500
Oh, my God.

1306
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,780
I don't want to kill them, but, well, I guess I have to.

1307
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,320
Oh, whatever.

1308
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:08,860
Q.

1309
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,100
Q.

1310
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,960
Q for kill.

1311
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:11,520
Q for kill, Q for kill.

1312
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,100
Q for kill.

1313
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,440
Oh, I think he's dead.

1314
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,900
Never mind.

1315
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,240
He's got some strength still in him.

1316
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,560
Son of a bitch.

1317
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,160
Just go away.

1318
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,120
You!

1319
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,580

Everything's okay now.

1329
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,040
We need to figure out how to get out of Savannah as fast as we can.

1330
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:37,180
Well, how many are in there?

1331
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:48,350
Hey.

1332
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,050
You weren't afraid.

01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:52,790
I was.

1334
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,390
You didn't act like it.

1335
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:55,430
I know.

1336
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,430

01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:58,590

1338
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,850
Can she get a happy birthday?

1343
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,910
Which leads to the other home.

1344
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,570
There's nothing in there.

1345
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,010
Can we go?

1346
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:48,670
Yeah, of course.

Okay.

1348
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:50,930
I'm just looking around.

1349
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:51,890
Any food?

Oh, him.

1353
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,410
I don't even know his name.

1354
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:00,370
Norman Bates.

1355
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,760
Dolahan.

1356
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,160

01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:13,420
Okay, let's go.

1358
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,780
Oh, I think I clicked look at it.

1359
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,840
Yeah, let's go.

1360
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,420
Hopefully the gunshot didn't attract people.

1361
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:23,940
Boom!

1362
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:31,040
Oh, he smells like a zombie now.

1363
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:40,590
He smells like a zombie now!

1364
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,770
It didn't bite you.

1365
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:54,250
Yeah, I know it must have you're covered in all that gross stuff Oh to get through a bunch of them to get here.

1366
01:31:54,550 --> 01:32:00,430
Yeah Maybe okay, never mind I thought it was because he was Zombo.

1367
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,590
Okay, it's because he's covered in Zombo blood

1368
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:13,970
Oh We're gonna be real stinky now Clem Who do Zombo?

1369
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,050
Oh, whoops.

1370
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,590
That's not what I meant to do.

1371
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,130
They smell horrible.

1372
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,310
Which means you have to, too.

1373
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:23,170
Okay.

1374
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:25,150
She understands.

1375
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,910
She knows.

1376
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,190
Oh, no.

1377
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,550
Oh, fragrance of Zombo.

1378
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:39,730
I'm gonna scoop up some of that guy.

1379
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:40,650
Oh, yeah.

1380
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:41,530
Ew!

1381
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,480
All right.

1382
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,540
Smear Clementine.

1383
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,000
Me too.

01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:03,660

01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:06,120
Ew.

1386
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,260
Is this so horrible?

1387
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:10,620
Are you okay?

1388
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,540
We'll get you cleaned up as soon as we can.

1389
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,160
Not soon enough.

1390
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,680
She's alright.

1391
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,720
The sound.

1392
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,280
Are you done?

1393
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,160
A little more.

1394
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,080
I want to be sure.

1395
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,200
Not the face.

1396
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,200
Don't get the face.

1397
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,160
Just a little more.

1398
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,160
Don't get...

1399
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,820
It's so gross.

1400
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,720
Don't get the face.

1401
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:37,880
I mean, is the whisper we say from the zombies?

1402
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,860
I think you guys smell good probably.

1403
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:44,680
There.

1404
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,180
That should do it.

1405
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,760
She makes it sound cold.

1406
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:48,840
You know, like...

1407
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,440
I hope so.

1408
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,540
Like if you're putting like a cold lotion on your body.

1409
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,920
I thought it was gone.

1410
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,080
Her heart!

1411
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,700
I thought you were gone.

1412
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,180
Thank you.

1413
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,020
Probably is.

1414
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:01,800
You think so?

1415
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,920
Stay right next to me.

1416
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,640
Walk very slowly.

1417
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:09,500
Don't look around.

1418
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:11,360
And don't panic.

1419
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,580
That's just like the TV show.

1420
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,780
I'll keep you safe.

1421
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,400
Probably cool since the zombies are dead.

1422
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:18,160
I guess that's true.

1423
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:18,960
I didn't think about it.

1424
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,720
There we go.

1425
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:22,600
Uh-oh.

1426
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,980
Sounds like it's gonna rain.

1427
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:26,560
Oh,

1428
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,220
we gotta go before it washes off our body.

1429
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,220
Yeah, Lee's looking real pale.

1430
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,440
I thought that too.

1431
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,050
Easy does it.

1432
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,370
Just push him away if you have to.

1433
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:46,190
Easy does it.

1434
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:46,790
Oh, hello.

1435
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:47,550

1436
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,590

1438
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:49,790

01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,280
Oh, he looks really bad.

1450
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,760

It was only a little open when I found it.

1459
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,120
I closed it to keep us safe.

1460
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,760
How did she pull him in here?

1461
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,620

01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:39,870
I should have told you.

1475
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:42,190
It was scary at the hotel.

1476
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,730
Yeah.

01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,030
We're going to keep going.

1482
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:53,810

You don't have much time.

1487
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,440
You've got to do something.

1488
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:37,900
Fast.

1489
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,380

01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,960
You need to get out of here.

1492
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,060
Make sure I don't turn.

1493
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:49,300
I can't leave you.

1494
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,960

1495
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,540
We'll figure it all out.

1496
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,160
Don't worry.

1497
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,020
The way out's through there, Clem.

1498
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:07,840
Yeah, yeah.

1499
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,500
I know.

1500
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,960
Okay, you gotta go.

1501
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,760
Just start by getting that door open.

1502
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:15,780
Okay, we'll help her out.

1503
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,540
It's locked.

1504
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:18,160
It's no big deal.

1505
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,060
It's just a glass window.

1506
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,760
Oh.

1507
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:23,720
Ow!

1508
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,680
Not with your hand.

1509
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,760
Use this thing.

1510
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,020
Or use, uh, this thing.

1511
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,000
There's a chair over there.

1512
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,660
Uh, use...

1513
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,760
a baseball bat.

1514
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,040
There you go.

1515
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,060
You can use that.

1516
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:40,860
How did he see that?

1517
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,980
I didn't even see that.

1518
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,900
You can do it to Larry.

1519
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,200
Okay, base...

1520
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:51,580
Use the bat to shadow that window so you can reach in, okay?

1521
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:52,540
Okay.

1522
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,040
Watch out for broken grass.

1523
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:56,700
Oh.

1524
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:09,470
Don't be afraid of him, honey.

1525
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:11,350
You're smart.

1526
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,670
He is it.

1527
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:16,570
Why is he stuck to the chair?

1528
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,570
Yeah, you're doing good.

1529
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:22,710
Yeah, you're doing good.

1530
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,710
The way out's through there, Clem.

1531
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,170
I know.

1532
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:27,390
Okay.

1533
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:29,670
Uh...

1534
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:30,390
Uh...

1535
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:31,350
Oh, there's a chair.

1536
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:32,710
Use it.

1537
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:32,850
Use it.

1538
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:33,130
There you go.

1539
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,830
Use it to reach in to the log.

1540
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:38,110
Be careful!

1541
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,070
It's a rolly chair!

1542
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:42,750
Wow, that thing is clean of glass, huh?

1543
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,790
Good thing.

1544
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,920
He's trapped.

1545
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,900
This will be easy, then.

1546
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:55,640
He's got keys.

1547
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,860
Probably to that door.

1548
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:58,380
Oh, yeah.

1549
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,040
And everything you'll need.

1550
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:05,920
Why don't you hit him in the head with the bat, maybe?

1551
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,680
You're doing really good.

1552
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,260
Another handcuff, son of Ralph.

1553
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,120
Get him.

1554
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:28,080
me I don't think we can handcuff him but

1555
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:57,220
she needs to get the keys I guess she can use the bat put the handcuffs on me attach me to this what why

1556
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,400
I don't know.

1557
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,740
Just do it, sweetie.

1558
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,440
Make sure they're tight.

1559
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:10,640
I don't want to do this.

1560
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:11,780
You have to.

1561
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,640
It'll keep you safe.

1562
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,100
You only have to deal with him.

1563
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,400
He's trapped over there.

1564
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,540
So careful.

1565
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,940
Get what you need from him.

1566
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:28,880
The keys.

1567
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,320
And then the gun.

1568
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:32,840
The keys and the gun.

1569
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,620
Just don't be afraid.

1570
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:38,440
If anything gets dangerous, you're faster than he is.

1571
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:38,900
Yeah.

1572
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,980
What should I get first?

1573
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,460
Get the gun.

1574
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,800
Uh, get the gun.

1575
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:45,720
Get the gun, Clem.

1576
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,140
Always the gun.

1577
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:47,880
Uh.

1578
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,040
Uh.

1579
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:58,680
Oh my gosh.

1580
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,160
Get him.

1581
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,220
Get him.

1582
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:01,740
Uh.

1583
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:02,500

1589
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,500
And now...

1590
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,920
You...

1591
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:40,600
Please...

1592
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,000
Please don't be one of them.

1593
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,080
Please don't become a walker.

1594
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:48,760
There's only one thing you can do.

1595
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,240
You know that.

1596
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,600
I don't know if I can.

1597
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,240
Oh, gosh.

1598
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,100
I have to decide.

1599
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:00,860
Uh...

1600
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,200
You have to shoot me, honey.

1601
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,420
Lee, no.

1602
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,120
It's okay.

1603
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,400
It's okay.

1604
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:17,740
And Megan, those days we met, do you remember?

1605
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,920
Yeah, I do.

1606
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,920
When I went out to rescue that boy, Claire, I met a girl.

1607
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,640
She'd been bitten, too.

1608
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:30,740
All she wanted was to come back as a walker.

1609
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:35,140
And I remember how hard it was to do that.

1610
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,120
But I'm glad I did.

1611
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:40,100
You don't want to see me like one of them.

1612
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Okay, Lee.

1613
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,300
I can do it.

1614
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,800
I can.

1615
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,120
Find that if I don't meet it, Krista.

1616
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,560
If I don't meet it, Krista.

1617
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,520
They're outside of town by the train.

1618
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,100
You remember how to get back there?

1619
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,420
Yes.

1620
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,200
Good.

1621
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:03,000
Oh, she'll remember this.

1622
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,380
Now take good care of you.

1623
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:13,900
And glim...

1624
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,140
You're a suit.

1625
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:20,140
You can always keep moving.

1626
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,480
Wait, I tried to do the hair!

1627
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:25,660
I'm gonna find some place like the motor in, but that's just not safe.

1628
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,700
Why not?

1629
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,060
Those places are just targets.

1630
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,080
Move as much as you can.

1631
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,200
And also...

1632
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,420
Oh my god.

1633
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,560
I wanted to do the hair.

1634
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,680
I messed up.

1635
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,160
What?

1636
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,820
What is it?

1637
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,920
No, don't worry.

1638
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:53,480
All right.

1639
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,780
Don't be afraid.

1640
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,600
Don't be afraid.

1641
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:31,850
Wait,

1642
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:38,170
when did I lose my temper with Kenny?

1643
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:42,130
You have 40% of players kept your weapons.

1644
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:44,030
I didn't even use them, though.

1645
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:47,530
Killed Clementine's captor.

1646
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:48,990
Wait, I tried to.

1647
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:51,010
What do you mean I didn't kill him?

1648
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:51,970
I tried.

1649
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:55,430
Oh, throwing the statue.

1650
01:49:56,170 --> 01:50:00,130
Oh, I forgot that it's an option to, like, not do that.

1651
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:02,270
Or like to not do anything.

1652
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:07,190
Yeah, Clem did it, but I tried.

1653
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:08,690
I tried to kill him.

1654
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,180
Man, you and 28% of players didn't remove your arm.

1655
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,620
So most people remove their arm?

1656
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:30,880
Wow.

1657
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,840
It wouldn't have mattered.

1658
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,260
I don't think so either.

1659
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:50,780
It was so much time after the bite had happened.

1660
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,880
It literally happened like in the day.

1661
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,360
They would have had to grab you maybe seconds later, cut off your arm immediately.

1662
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,120
Let's see the...

1663
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:06,340
Oh.

1664
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:08,600
Oh, wow.

1665
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,200
You found water for Duck when he needed it.

1666
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,280
He was lost to the herd trying to save Ben.

1667
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,860
Larry died in the meat locker.

1668
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,440
Where you belong?

1669
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:28,480
You were separated after you crossed the sign.

1670
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:31,680
Yeah.

1671
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,900
Oh, me it's the only one smiling.

1672
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,570
You left her on the side of the road.

1673
01:51:41,930 --> 01:52:07,470
Ben fell to his death in a savannah alleyway You defended her against Lily's accusations And she died for it You asked her and Omiya to take care of them and die No, dog You had so much more I like how Ben is only two little things When he was with us for so many episodes

1674
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:16,140
You let him be your sidekicks Solve a mystery Oh.

1675
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:39,850
Ben caused most of these deaths.

1676
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:41,330
He really did.

1677
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:46,530
Oh.

1678
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:51,270
So there's something after the credits that she meet with.

1679
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:53,870
Oh my gosh, it's a good thing we didn't tell.

1680
01:52:54,290 --> 01:53:03,230
Kenny thought we wanted him to take care of her of Clem Beacons

1681
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:35,690
Last years and The trail Take us back off take us back off I guess I'll wait for the aftersane.

1682
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:43,090
Yeah, Ben took out Kenny's whole family, man.

1683
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:50,130
Got me again this time.

1684
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:55,920
Like I knew that.

1685
01:53:55,940 --> 01:54:16,440
was gonna be inevitable because of the last episode but ah just yeah it sucks voice actors in this game are so good of

1686
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:27,260
days when love was true

1687
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:37,260
No.

1688
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:48,320
Just beyond the silent surface.

1689
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:54,860
Started in cuffs, died in cuffs.

1690
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,440
I didn't think about that.

1691
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,240
Me!

1692
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:01,500
Me!

1693
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,480
Oh my gosh, the pets!

1694
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,240
I love when they do this.

1695
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:11,700
Peekaboo the cat!

1696
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:19,230
And me!

1697
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:22,070
So sad.

1698
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:24,430
Oh, okay.

1699
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,540
Glam!

1700
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,220
Me too.

1701
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:40,060
Did Krista and Omid make it?

1702
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:40,780
Yeah.

1703
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:17,000
what is that batteries oh no they're they're shells did he teach her how to reload the gun he taught her how to shoot but wait is it zombo no that's not zombo that's too tall to be omid

1704
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,330
is it them

1705
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,500
it's kind of creepy They could...

1706
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,300
They could wave.

1707
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:34,790
Oh!

1708
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:42,260
It's them, right?

1709
01:56:45,730 --> 01:56:46,790
It's Kenny and Ben.

1710
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:55,000
And then her seeing her parents.

1711
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:57,760
Oh.

1712
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,000
Why did they go back?

1713
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:03,980
Why did they go back?

1714
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,060
It's Doug and Larry.

1715
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:14,460
Oh.

1716
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:25,800
They almost didn't put Clementine in the game because they couldn't find the right actor for her.

1717
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:29,420
Let's be thankful for Clem's voice actors beautifully voicing her.

1718
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:32,740
How would you have this without Clem?

1719
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,360
No, all the actors were really amazing.

1720
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:43,920
Oh.

1721
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:49,830
And then there's this DLC, right?

1722
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:50,950
the 400 days.

1723
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:58,330
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot he was in the game.

1724
01:57:58,650 --> 01:57:59,490
Whatever his name was.

1725
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:00,290
Glenn?

1726
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:04,850
Will you play other Telltale games?

1727
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:06,170
I would like to.

1728
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:10,910
A lot of people have been recommending Borderlands and I think there's a Batman one.

1729
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:16,910
I was looking at one of them yesterday.

1730
01:58:20,650 --> 01:59:09,230
For the other seasons of this him i'll think about it um i really liked this one but uh my hesitation with the other seasons uh or yeah other seasons is just i've heard mixed reviews from literally everybody about every single one so i'm kind of like hesitant i've heard i've heard season two is great and i've heard season two is bad and i've heard season three is okay and i've heard season three is terrible and i've heard season four is all right i've heard season four so i really don't i'm not quite sure yet i will consider it though i will think about it oh that was so sad

1731
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:19,750
but i'll think about it because to play the whole thing would be quite an undertaking

1732
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:31,630
So, I will never say never, but, you know, I will, I'll think about it.

1733
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:38,610
Oh yeah, and then the Wolf Among Us, yeah, I was looking at that one too.

1734
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:48,080
For good laughs, see the Telltale Batman with the animations removed.

1735
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:56,980
Oh, Moogus?

1736
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:01,720
Do you guys see that Among Us is doing a Genshin Impact collab?

1737
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:04,460
What is going on in that game?

1738
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:11,720
Members watch along of three of the three Back to the Future.

1739
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,700
Then you play Telltale Back to the Future.

1740
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:17,160
Wait, it's also Back to the Future's 40th anniversary.

1741
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:23,600
Why?

1742
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:24,320
I have no idea.

1743
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,140
What about Among Us?

1744
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:25,980
I have no idea.

1745
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,200
Uh...

1746
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,780
Strong bad game.

1747
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:38,100
You're watching it in theaters?

1748
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:38,560
What?

1749
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:39,260
Back to the future?

1750
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,200
I've only seen

1751
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:47,950
the first one.

1752
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:51,090
Did I watch the second one?

1753
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:52,430
What happens in the second one?

1754
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:53,930
I can't remember.

1755
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:59,010
Strong bad.

1756
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,090
strong bad emails

1757
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:33,160
they go back from the future he goes to the future maybe i only watch the first one then because i watched it actually i think what it was is i because i watched it really for the first time relatively recently and i watched it and it was on the plane and i think the plane only had like one and three?

1758
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,900
Or it might have been just one and two.

1759
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,160
And I feel like I would have watched both of them then.

1760
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:40,680
But I don't remember the second one at all.

1761
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:43,580
Ah.

1762
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:46,240
Man, my head hurts from crying.

1763
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:49,220
Hold on, where's my water?

1764
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,240
Oh, there it is.

1765
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:51,380
Oh.

1766
02:01:57,770 --> 02:02:01,050
We really ended the game.

1767
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:08,350
Oh, well, Clementine had kind of like a I feel like if Clem died, the game was over kind of deal.

1768
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:10,410
So Clem doesn't count, but...

1769
02:02:12,850 --> 02:02:16,370
If I hadn't killed...

1770
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:20,950
Or if I had killed Ben, would Kenny have survived?

1771
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:21,970
Be honest.

1772
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,890
Be honest with me.

1773
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:24,430
Team.

1774
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:25,610
Team.

1775
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:29,570
If I had...

1776
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:30,330
No?

1777
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:31,170
Oh, okay.

1778
02:02:36,120 --> 02:03:46,900
he dies in a different way okay okay okay he sacrifices himself for krista instead oh i felt like that i feel like that is that's a more worthy cause i thought i honestly after the boat being taken all i hope vernon and his crew i hope i hope they drown but um for for uh what's it called for kenny after the boat was taken i feel like he just kind of was he was like no there's no hope left 400 days shows what happens to them oh does it maybe i'm we'll play that then is that like a one is that like how long is 400 days wait one second oh dlc

1779
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:54,220
it's short it's 400 days

1780
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:27,260
okay let's see from day one of the undead plague to 400 days later the walking dead 400 days offers more of the horror and human drama of robert kirkley and telltales award-winning series well he lives if you're not died did me leaving duck hanging change nothing um uh i want to look at the pictures

1781
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:34,700
is that like a bunch of different people it seems like

1782
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:40,200
Oh, I'm so sad.

1783
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,720
It's all your fault.

1784
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,760
Keep telling yourself that.

1785
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:50,650
It's a bunch of one shots.

1786
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:51,430
Okay, okay.

1787
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:52,630
Man.

1788
02:04:55,090 --> 02:04:56,850
I feel like...

1789
02:04:56,850 --> 02:04:58,110
Okay, okay.

1790
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:00,190
Now I'm seeing the season two.

1791
02:05:00,730 --> 02:05:02,230
I tried not to look before.

1792
02:05:02,810 --> 02:05:03,930
I figured...

1793
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,550
I was like, Clementine's probably gonna live.

1794
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:08,530
But...

1795
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:12,910
I realized she became like the pro tag for the rest of the games.

1796
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:15,510
Okay.

1797
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:20,290
I'm seeing now.

1798
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:21,750
Don't look.

1799
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:22,450
I'm sorry.

1800
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:25,930
Sorry.

1801
02:05:27,550 --> 02:05:28,210
Don't look.

1802
02:05:30,290 --> 02:05:30,690
Don't look.

1803
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:33,150
I'm literally just hovered over.

1804
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:33,870
I can't.

1805
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:34,470
I'm sorry.

1806
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:35,650
Guys, this is what I see.

1807
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:38,630
The steam is spoiling it for me.

1808
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:39,430
Wait, hold on.

1809
02:05:40,590 --> 02:05:43,330
Steam, literally Steam spoiled it for me.

1810
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:47,190
I had, it was like, buy the Walking Dead collection.

1811
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:51,010
And then it said, Walking Dead final season.

1812
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,050
And Clem's face is on it, okay?

1813
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:57,630
I didn't, I didn't do anything.

1814
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:01,670
It's Steam.

1815
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:09,570
Maybe it's not Clem.

1816
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:38,110
the same hat that's definitely her that's her 100% but she's she's it's totally her look at this hold on I'll show you I'll show you what it shows me all done let me actually screenshot it there we go okay hold on steam steam.png this is what it shows me this is what it shows me look at that How could I...

1817
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:39,490
Walking Dead, the final season.

1818
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,790
She's right there.

1819
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:44,930
It's her evil twin.

1820
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:52,650
I'm imagining an alternate version where they don't find Clem's VA and end up pointing the series to Lee being a father figure for Ben.

1821
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:59,370
That could be anyone.

1822
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:00,430
She's wearing the hat.

1823
02:07:01,390 --> 02:07:04,250
That hat is Clem's walk-a-moment.

1824
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:58,810
the protag torch it was him being like him doing the little tutorial for her him backseating her no that is not Clem oh I don't feel good though I feel actually very sad I'm glad though that he didn't turn if I had said leave instead of shoot would she leave or would she be like no I can't do it so sad oh she does she just leaves Wow she really would leave Wow well

1825
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:13,490
now she knows that he is not a zombie you can also tell her to avoid people and she ends up alone

1826
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:19,250
Aww.

1827
02:08:21,230 --> 02:08:23,490
I wanted to tell her about keeping her hair short.

1828
02:08:24,490 --> 02:08:25,270
My one regret.

1829
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,710
No wonder I'm a ghost.

1830
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:29,630
Oh.

1831
02:08:31,490 --> 02:08:32,190
Oh.

1832
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:34,190
Kenny.

1833
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:37,010
Aww.

1834
02:08:39,950 --> 02:08:40,650
Aww.

1835
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:41,930
Aww.

1836
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,050
Aww.

1837
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:44,350
Aww.

1838
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:44,670
Aww.

1839
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:47,610
Hope you had a fun time.

1840
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:50,310
Thanks for letting me relive the game.

1841
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:54,670
I really do want to do, like, a route where I'm just a jerk to everybody.

1842
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:58,370
I just want to see what happens.

1843
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:03,130
Oh, well, thank you so much for the good thing I have to thank you.

1844
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:05,110
Thank you.

1845
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:08,810
Bully Maguire, yeah.

1846
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:14,270
Scumbag lead playthrough videos are hilarious.

1847
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:31,830
but I wanted to do like a proper playthrough of what I would actually pick rather than just you know rather than just causing shit starting shit being a little bit of a menace

1848
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:51,570
the final Clementine will remember that she would happily probably shoot me she would probably happily shoot me and then and then that's that

1849
02:09:57,330 --> 02:10:23,410
but you are a menace yeah but i felt this game was a little too serious to be so i wanted to since it was my first time experiencing it it's really fun to be a jerk to everyone in the wolf among us okay this one this one i heard was sad so i was like okay i'll i'll play it serious but mischief minto But with other ones,

1850
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:28,530
you know, I like to be a little bit of a troublemaker.

1851
02:10:29,850 --> 02:10:31,410
I got married yesterday!

1852
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:33,890
So by law, they're your wife, too.

1853
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:35,210
Moonekin!

1854
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,090
Congratulations!

1855
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:39,910
We got married!

1856
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:52,250
What if in my asshole playthrough, I actually high-five duck?

1857
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:59,290
It's the one ounce of kindness that I have.

1858
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,840
This was much shorter than I thought it would be, actually.

1859
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:08,600
Not the game itself, but this chapter.

1860
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:17,620
I can't believe the guy that kidnapped her was the guy from the car.

1861
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,160
What a...

1862
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:19,500
What?

1863
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,460
What a weenie.

1864
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:23,240
What a weenie.

1865
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,000
First, you have your kid go missing.

1866
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,900
Why weren't you watching your kid?

1867
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:28,080
What happened?

1868
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:30,500
And then...

1869
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:32,920
And then...

1870
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:37,220
Your wife and daughter leave you, but you're gonna be like, oh, I'm all better than you.

1871
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:40,920
I kidnapped this girl, but you were just trying to survive.

1872
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,040
I just...

1873
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,420
I...

1874
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:45,600
It's...

1875
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:47,660
I...

1876
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:49,060
It's so bizarre.

1877
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:53,440
Dude is blaming everyone but himself.

1878
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:54,040
Yeah!

1879
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,860
He didn't want to admit his own mistakes.

1880
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:58,260
What?

1881
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:59,320
It was just so bizarre.

1882
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:02,940
I mean, we already knew he was loony because he kept his wife's head in a bag.

1883
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:06,780
He had already lost it.

1884
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:08,500
Yeah, yeah.

1885
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,840
Yeah, it wasn't exactly stable, huh?

1886
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:18,880
But...

1887
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:22,480
But also, just so strange.

1888
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,680
So strange.

1889
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:41,240
I don't know what I would do if I were, you know, in an apocalypse and I saw a car that was abandoned full of food I mean, I might assume that they got turned into zombos, right?

1890
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,000
Do you have any recommendations for cafes and stuff in Ikebukuro?

1891
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,320
Sorry, I was asking if I feel bad for...

1892
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:49,300
Oh, yes, thank you, Garlamal, thank you, thank you.

1893
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:51,200
Stuff in Ikebukuro.

1894
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:52,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1895
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:54,920
No, don't feel bad at all because I said remind me later.

1896
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:03,240
Oh gosh, there was a place I went to, um, where, what was it?

1897
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:05,760
There was a place in Ikebukuro I went to before.

1898
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:14,120
Oh, so there's, um, uh, there's a Capcom cafe in Ikebukuro that is fun to go to.

1899
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:21,300
Um, last time I went, they were doing the Great Ace Attorney, a collab with that game.

1900
02:13:22,020 --> 02:14:43,140

1902
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:50,060
I wish I could see what this building is called.

1903
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:51,740
Oh, Grandscape Ikebukuro.

1904
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:54,900
Grandscape Ikebukuro.

1905
02:14:58,580 --> 02:15:00,500
I can research myself.

1906
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,380
I'm not helpless, like Ben.

1907
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:06,240
Apparently there's a Burger King in there.

1908
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:19,220
Yeah, there's another, like, it's kind of like they say it's a capcom uh like gotcha store like gotcha place but

1910
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:44,920
Yes!

1911
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:49,140
The espresso EDW Dwerks.

1912
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:52,020
What is it?

1913
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:52,860
Espresso...

1914
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:53,400
Wait, let me see.

1915
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:54,520
Wait.

1916
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:55,240
Hold on.

1917
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,200
Espresso EDW.

1918
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:57,000
I can't look at all.

1919
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:58,300
I have to see the inside.

1920
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:00,360
If I see the inside, I'll know it.

1921
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:02,140
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1922
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,880
Espresso Dwerks.

1923
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:06,160
Dwerks.

1924
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,080
Espresso Dwerks.

1925
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:09,600
Dwerks.

1926
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:14,900
I guess it's also an espresso place.

1927
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:17,920
I liked it.

1928
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:18,300
It was good.

1929
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:20,300
It was quite good.

1930
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:24,220
I had the spaghetti and it was spicy and that made me a little sad.

1931
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:27,540
But actually it was...

1932
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:29,280
Okay, I told the story before.

1933
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:30,060
But it was here.

1934
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,560
I was with a friend.

1935
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:35,860
And which...

1936
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:38,500
No, I won't say.

1937
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:40,120
I was with a friend.

1938
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,300
And we were both...

1939
02:16:42,320 --> 02:17:06,260
going to go to a Hollow Live concert together because we got an invitation to go watch and we were like, okay, we'll go we'll travel together and we messaged a third friend that was going to come with us and the third friend was just like, oh yeah, she was like,

1940
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,540
what do you mean today?

1941
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:09,140
I'll see you guys tomorrow!

1942
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:12,740
And we were like, tomorrow.

1943
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:15,560
No, it's today.

1944
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:17,340
And,

1945
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:28,680
and, and we were like, wait, no, it's today.

1946
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:30,540
And, we were in Ike Bukuro.

1947
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:35,420
We, if you Google Ike Bukuro to Saitama, it's about a 40 minute train ride.

1948
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:55,880
And so right after we were eating this, we were going to get on the train to go to Saitama because it was at And we were like, wait, if it's tomorrow, okay, if it's tomorrow, wait, what did I, did I say, wait, so she was saying, it's not today, it's tomorrow,

1949
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:12,020
and I was like, yeah, wait, no, we were like, no, it's today, and she was like, no, it's tomorrow, and, yeah, it was Gamers Fest, yeah, yeah, yeah, and both my friend and I were just like, wait, how did we both get the date wrong?

1950
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:15,960
How did we both get the date wrong?

1951
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:20,520
And we were both going to go to this event that was not even happening this day.

1952
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:26,480
We were going to travel 40 minutes away to go to this concert that was not happening.

1953
02:18:31,600 --> 02:19:08,160
And unfortunately, on that day, the day after, so the tomorrow that we were going to go to the concert, was me flying back home so in the end i didn't even get to go i was so sad i was so sad was it provided to you wrong or something nope no she and i just had the same brain cell she and i just had the same brain cell so we were like why we're how did we both mess this up cut it in friday night

1954
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:14,800
Oh, yeah, we both really messed it up.

1955
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:20,660
She was still able to go, though, and I really wanted the pen light, and she picked it up for me, so I'm happy, happy.

1956
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:24,840
So, yeah, espresso D works Ike Bukuro.

1957
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:26,900
My recommendation.

1958
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:28,640
The bread is really good.

1959
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:31,820
And they just come around, and they're like, would you like to try this bread?

1960
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:34,000
And I was like, yeah, give me more bread.

1961
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:34,860
Give me more bread.

1962
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:38,340
Friendship wins in the end.

1963
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:39,860
Yeah, she's so sweet.

1964
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:40,580
I love her.

1965
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:47,040
So, um, yeah.

1966
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:54,060
But, unfortunately, I don't know so many other places in Ikebukuro.

1967
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,880
Um, unfortunately, I do not.

1968
02:19:58,060 --> 02:19:59,260
I only go a little bit.

1969
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:07,540
I don't like going to that area because it's like, um, because it's such a, like, uh, like, uh, how do you say?

1970
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:10,080
Like there's Otome Road and everything.

1971
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,200
There's a lot of girls.

1972
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,300
Because there's a lot of girls.

1973
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:44,540
girls there's also a lot of guys who like to like to nampa and so um not red light district no no no but like sometimes the guys will be very aggressive and they'll like follow you to your train and i'm like go away go away uh otaku guys in akihabara don't bother me They're not interested.

1974
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:50,480
So, only at Ikebukuro.

1975
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:57,720
I'm anime woman, but I'm not from their anime, you know.

1976
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:59,700
2D only.

1977
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:04,680
I mean, I am, but I'm not from something that they're interested in.

1978
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:08,900
No.

1979
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:44,280
so one too many dimensions once I become once I become 3D now then they'll never talk to me ever again ever ever Nampa Horde be like the walkers in the episode there's like and it's not even just me like it happening to me like I see it happening to people and I'm like ugh ugh Or like to my friends,

1980
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,240
I'm like, Ah, stay away from her!

1981
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:50,760
She's mine!

1982
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,340
2D over 3D girls.

1983
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:55,940
Yeah!

1984
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:04,750
So, yeah, back, you beasts.

1985
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:11,050
I need to walk around with like a chair that like keeps them away, you know?

1986
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:17,190
Anyway, this was, was this fun?

1987
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:18,750
It was fun.

1988
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:21,010
I'm glad I played it.

1989
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:23,170
I'm very sad I played it.

1990
02:22:23,710 --> 02:22:27,150
I could have gone my whole afterlife not playing it.

1991
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:29,510
But, hmm.

1992
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:33,330
It was good storytelling.

1993
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:34,070
Yeah.

1994
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:36,530
It was.

1995
02:22:37,810 --> 02:22:38,230
We.

1996
02:22:40,910 --> 02:22:42,730
We, I tried to keep it live.

1997
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:43,770
I tried to do it with these types.

1998
02:22:43,790 --> 02:22:52,230
of games anyway you know i make jokes ben died 10 out of 10 what a what a pathetic way to die

1999
02:22:56,360 --> 02:23:03,920
oh speaking of weenies the guy in the hotel is a weenie ben just thanks for the stream thank you

2000
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:20,180
just man

2001
02:23:26,530 --> 02:23:54,470
man bad day to be named ben not you the walking dead telltale games ben but not every other ben not ben any ben in the chat you're awesome every ben in the chat is great ben's my co-worker okay that guy i can't vouch for ben died as he lived complaining and making it someone else's problem.

2002
02:23:55,230 --> 02:24:00,550
I just think, you know, in this, in these kinds of situations, and everybody was guilty of this.

2003
02:24:00,910 --> 02:24:01,830
I'll, I'll say that.

2004
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:16,390
Everybody was very guilty of this, but you kind of gotta, you know, if you're in a group, you gotta think of the group, you know, and Ben was never a team player, as much as he wanted to be.

2005
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:48,990
He, he would always be like, I have my own problems too, but everyone has their literally it's an apocalypse everybody's going through it you kind of just have to like you know you kind of gotta be like okay i i i gotta i gotta you guys just have to pull it together you actually have to oh my gosh scuba i'm not named ben but can you tell me i'm awesome yeah you're awesome everybody's awesome you're all awesome

2006
02:24:53,850 --> 02:25:40,910
the bandits off the group's back yes but like he was trading their resources and not he didn't explain that to anybody either because because he didn't communicate with the team if they had known that he was if he had if he had this deal if if if they had known he had this deal like then what's her name what was her name lily lily i think it was she wouldn't have been like i'm i'm paranoid now and then and then it wouldn't have sparked lead to go find the missing medicines and take it and then the deal fell through and then they got attacked

2007
02:25:49,140 --> 02:26:10,200
the attack would have happened i mean maybe the the hotel was not a great place to be we can i think we can all agree with that they would have left sooner yeah they needed to but also it was like kenny was trying to leave it was lily that was holding him back

2008
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:52,380
so i know ben was a kid i know and i know a lot of people say try to like be like don't be so teenager just kind of going you know i can't say how i would be i don't know i'm dead anyway so but but but it's a doggy dog world and you either you either pull your shit together or you get the entire crew killed that's kind of how it goes

2009
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:00,240
It's just the sad part of it.

2010
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:03,040
A doggy dog world.

2011
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:08,160
Kids shouldn't have acted independently.

2012
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:09,560
I mean.

2013
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:12,460
Unfortunately.

2014
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:17,780
He probably thought he had the, you know, the crew's best interest.

2015
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:20,140
He was trying to get the bandits off of them.

2016
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:25,860
But we also saw how the bandits were for like the other people that they made deals with.

2017
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:32,580
So, making a deal with them in the first place is not a good idea, I think.

2018
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:37,300
I think it's just better to leave.

2019
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,940
Doggy dog world.

2020
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,240
It's freak or get freaked, my man.

2021
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:47,960
I'm freaking it.

2022
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,740
I choose to freak it, I think.

2023
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:58,110
Clementine handled herself a lot better than most adults in the game.

2024
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:03,890
She's a, she's a, she's a, maybe, I think someone called her an anomaly before though.

2025
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:08,110
She freaked it.

2026
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:10,010
I freaked it.

2027
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:10,830
I freaked it.

2028
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:15,450
Ben tried his best, and that's more than most did.

2029
02:28:16,390 --> 02:28:17,550
Ben did try.

2030
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:25,190
Did he, well, he, uh, well, you know, Clementine was about to get attacked and he ran.

2031
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:28,310
Um.

2032
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:42,880
if you try to save larry kenny calls you useless and does it anyway he then picks fights with you for two to three episodes no matter how friendly you are really

2033
02:28:46,780 --> 02:29:02,820
i i did get some comments from people being like oh i'm used to kenny being a real jerk so um i mean i think it's very safe to say no none of these characters were perfect But that's...

2034
02:29:02,820 --> 02:29:03,760
That's realistic.

2035
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:08,880
That's realistic, you know?

2036
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:12,720
I do think that a lot of decisions were questionable.

2037
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:17,380
And a lot of options and dialogues were questionable.

2038
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:20,440
But Ben tried to die a couple of times.

2039
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:21,180
Yeah.

2040
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:25,160
Do you disagree with him?

2041
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:26,940
Like, once or twice he's very combative.

2042
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:27,700
Oh, geez.

2043
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:28,840
That would have been miserable.

2044
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:31,540
Except Molly.

2045
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:32,360
She's perfect.

2046
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:38,520
Oh, me and I liked him a lot.

2047
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:39,440
I'm glad he lived.

2048
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,220
He ended up being so silly.

2049
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:45,520
He was just a silly guy.

2050
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:48,700
He was funny.

2051
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:51,620
Kenny's kind of miserable.

2052
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,380
Yeah.

2053
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:59,300
I wonder what all these people would be like not in an apocalypse.

2054
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:01,260
You know?

2055
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:02,380
Hmm.

2056
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:06,940
Like, Kenny, I've totally only looked out for his own.

2057
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:10,600
Uh...

2058
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:12,440
Yeah.

2059
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:15,440
Larry would be the same.

2060
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:19,340
Larry is a miserable piece of doo-doo.

2061
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:23,720
Battery girl.

2062
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:24,820
Uh, Carly.

2063
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,980
It's kind of the sad thing about Kenny's hypocrisy.

2064
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:34,920
I know, like, he's such a bro.

2065
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:36,560
And then at the same time, you're like, Kenny.

2066
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:39,140
Kenny, we can't just...

2067
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:42,600
Oh, oh, he's just like, I gotta look out for my family.

2068
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:44,460
And you're like, oh, Kenny, Kenny, come on.

2069
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:46,340
I need you to reason with me a little bit, buddy.

2070
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,640
I need you to reason with me a little bit.

2071
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:53,380
We lost, like, like, losing Carly was a huge hit because she was super rational.

2072
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:55,120
And, uh,

2073
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:01,790
yeah, he's a real character.

2074
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:02,970
Exactly, exactly.

2075
02:31:05,290 --> 02:31:05,690
Hmm.

2076
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:11,340
What makes a person is their ability to change.

2077
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:55,540
but like you know i kind of said earlier like i like that you know with kenny you could be like hey man this and he'd be like i know you know like he wasn't perfect he really he was far from perfect but you know he had some rational thought dog would have found the cure the g he was on the verge of a breakthrough he was like tomorrow tomorrow is the day that i'll figure out how to how to cure this terrible infection the

2078
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:48,260
cure was the turns out the cure was to be a chill guy i don't understand though why isn't everyone always covering themselves in in zombo rot then if that's just how you get through them like as soon as i learn that i would be going everywhere head to toe like covered in in in whatever whatever comes out of them you'd get used to it do you guys realize how stinky people were back in like days when they didn't like like people what was it oh gosh like before baths were considered like good people just stank so bad i think it's the same

2079
02:32:52,020 --> 02:33:14,260
in the show someone gets deathly ill from it oh well you know all you have to do okay hear me out you don't have to be covered all the time but all you have to do is find if you're like okay i gotta go out i gotta go get supplies find one guy kill him rub it all over your body And then you come back,

2080
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:20,900
and then you're just like, okay, let the river fall down, and wash me clean, and then you're fine.

2081
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:29,700
That's all you gotta do.

2082
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:30,860
I think I would survive.

2083
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:33,900
I've got it all figured out.

2084
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:37,540
I've got it all figured out.

2085
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,860
