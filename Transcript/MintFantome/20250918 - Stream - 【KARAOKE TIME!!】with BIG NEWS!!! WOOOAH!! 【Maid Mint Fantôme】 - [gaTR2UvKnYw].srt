Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

3

Hi, hi, hi, hi.

4
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,980
Hi, hi.

5
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,920
Hi, hi.

6
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,400
Thank you.

7
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,580

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,610
Thank you so much!

10
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,350
Hi, Mito.

11
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,890
That's me!

12
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,210
Welcome!

13
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,650
Welcome!

14
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,010
I'm nervous!

15
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,150
I'm back!

16
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm nervous!

17
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,500
Oh gosh.

18
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,920
I promise.

19
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm okay.

20
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,240
We're fine.

21
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm getting nervous during karaoke.

22
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,220
But I feel like it's always just one of those things where it's like, I have something to announce.

23
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,880
How do I announce?

24
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,600
Karaoke.

25
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,960
It's like the VTuber go-to event for announcements.

26
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,130
But...

27
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,810
I'm just gonna sing.

28
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,230
And then I'll announce something.

29
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,790
Speak announcement!

30
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,950
Woohoo!

31
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,730
What could it be?

32
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,110
What could it be?

33
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,150
What could it be?

34
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:52,490

45
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,070
How old are you now?

46
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,690
Happy birthday to you!

47
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,830
How old are you now?

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,310
Happy birthday to you!

49
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,390
Happy birthday to you!

50
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,490
Happy birthday to you!

51
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,660
I was gonna go into like the How old are you now?

52
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,660
How...

53
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,720
It was just the same thing over and over again.

54
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Boys, there's a six minute song Wait, this is Stevie Wonder.

55
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,020
Hold on.

56
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,100
I'm experimenting.

57
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,650
Does anyone know this?

58
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,650
It's six minutes long.

59
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:11,650
Happy

60
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,100
birthday.

61
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,920
Is it you?

62
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,980
Or else I won't know.

63
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:29,930
Oh.

64
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,790
You know it doesn't make much sense.

65
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,290
Never mind.

66
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,830
Also, I forgot to turn the lead vocals off.

67
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,090
Okay.

68
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,850
Well, that was kind of groovy.

69
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,990
the version Herb sings?

70
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,370
Really?

71
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,650
I've never heard her sing it.

72
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,830
They probably don't have the Metal Gear one.

73
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,550
Happy birthday.

74
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,410
Congratulations.

75
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,350
Happy birthday with salutations.

76
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,390
Happy birthday.

77
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,890
May your sky stay blue.

78
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,230
Happy birthday to you.

79
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,370
That's from Metal Gear?

80
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,210
Yes.

81
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,530
That's from Metal Gear.

82
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,580
My birthday was just this Monday.

83
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,020
Sumati, happy birthday!

84
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,180
Alrighty.

85
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,580
May your sky stay blue.

86
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,080
What should we sing first?

87
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,220
I have some songs that I want to sing.

88
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,460
I'm not going to take requests.

89
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,740
Well, I will, if I feel like it.

90
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,340
You know, I'm not like...

91
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,340
I'm specifically taking requests or anything, but there's a song.

92
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,680
Wait, hold on.

93
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,720
There's a song I want to sing.

94
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
I wonder if there's a karaoke of it.

95
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,060
Hold on.

96
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,020
Okay, hold on.

97
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,780
I probably should have looked this up.

98
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
Wait, I think I have one.

99
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,320
Wait, hold on.

100
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm stupid.

101
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm so unprepared.

102
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,400
I thought this was going to be... I thought my stream was in an hour from now.

103
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,060
I forgot.

104
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,240
I set this for.

105
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,100
I forgot.

106
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,520
I forgot.

107
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,820
I did.

108
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
I messed up.

109
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,740
I messed up.

110
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,540
I messed up.

111
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,100
But that's okay.

112
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,760
We're fine.

113
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,460
Everything's fine.

114
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,680
Everything's okay.

115
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,140
Hold on.

116
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
Maybe I shouldn't start with this.

117
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,200
But I still have to get it if I want to sing it later.

118
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay.

119
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,740
Okay.

120
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,820
One moment.

121
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,980
One moment, please.

122
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Hold.

123
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,260
Huh.

124
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
Where are my stuff?

125
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,780
Sorry, I just ate.

126
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,360
I, like, had the fastest sandwich ever.

127
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
That probably was a mistake.

128
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,040
Now that I think about it.

129
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Oops.

130
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,620
Okay, screw this.

131
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,160

The skyscrapers causing vertigo.

138
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,400
The countdown begins in Tokyo.

139
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,140
27 days alone means 20 million ways to cope.

140
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,140
Without you, I'm in a rush.

141

Wait, hold on.

182
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,100

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,120

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,040

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,910
I was like, this is kind of funny.

220
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,970
I want to sing this song.

221
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,190
I don't know why I didn't sing it before.

222
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,530
Maybe I had like a already a set list or something.

223
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,050
And I decided not to.

224
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,090
Okay, we sing.

225
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,270
Oh, girl, we've got work to do.

226
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,690
Pass me the paint and glue.

227
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:20,770
Fair tisn't easy, but it's me.

228
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,010
When one knows the world is watching, one does what one must.

229
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:37,290
Some minor adjustments, darling, not for my vanity, but for humanity.

230
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,910
Each little step opposed.

231
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:51,090
Sometimes it's too much for even me.

232
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,690
But when all the world says yes, then who am I to say no?

233
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:06,070
Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl, no girl, you need a pro.

234
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,490
Not a flea or a flaw.

235
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,790
Take a peek at that paw, la-di-da, la-di-da.

236
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,250
Perfection becomes me in this epa.

237
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,770
Unrivaled, unruffled, and beauty unleashed.

238
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,270
Yeah!

239
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,010
Jaws drop, hearts stop.

240
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,950
So classic and classy, we're not talking lassie.

241
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,370
And how?

242
00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:00,990
Although many covet, my bone and bull, they're barking up the wrong tree.

243
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,970
We pretty pups all over the city.

244
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,690
I have your hearts and you have my pity.

245
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,310
Pretty is nice but still, it's just pretty.

246
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,870
Perfect, my dears, is me!

247
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,280
I

248
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,110
didn't realize how goofy that song is.

249
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,970
Do you guys remember Oliver and Company?

250
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,590
I used to love that.

251
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,830
There was some part in...

252
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,670
Perfect...

253
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,490
Isn't easy.

254
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,710
There was like a part in the movie.

255
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:19,490
movie where the girl makes the cat some like slop and i always wanted to eat it it looked so delicious i was like i want to eat that slop i want that slow give me some give me what she's having i was i was so much thank you i was like marissa you're so funny we were barking we were dogs

256
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,680
babish has a recipe for it no No way.

257
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,920
I wasn't the only one that wanted to eat it.

258
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,400
Clearly.

259
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,400
I wanted to eat the crackers from Aristocats.

260
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,580
I don't remember those.

261
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Sounds like a tiny dog.

262
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,800
Small dog.

263
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,280
Big dog.

264
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,140
Woof, woof.

265
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,780
I don't remember why.

266
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,460
I think I was just going through stuff.

267
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,840
And I was like just writing down songs.

268
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,240
Let's do this one.

269
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,960
I've got a ticket for the long way round.

270
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Two bottle of whiskey for the way.

271
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,780
And I sure would like some sweet company.

272
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,820
And I'm leaving tomorrow.

273
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,320
What do you say?

274
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,980
When I'm gone.

275
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,900
When I'm gone.

276
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,440
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

277
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
You're gonna miss me.

278
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:38,910
I like to give you shivers, but it sure would be prettier with you when I'm on.

279
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,710
When I'm

280
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:13,960
on.

281
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,240
You're gonna miss me by my walk.

282
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,300
You're gonna miss me by my taco.

283
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
You're gonna miss me when I'm on.

284
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,000
Yay!

285
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,160
The cup song!

286
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
Have I ever sung that song before?

287
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,740
I don't know, actually.

288
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,320
Cups.

289
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,440
What do I put?

290
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,180
Cups?

291
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,920
People don't do what I'm talking about when I put cups.

292
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm not quite sure.

293
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,980
Probably, right?

294
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,280
I think a lot of you probably know that song.

295
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,600
Cups.

296
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,380
When I'm gone.

297
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,780
Would you miss me?

298
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,300
Would you miss me I've ever gone?

299
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,760
Well, I'm not going anywhere, so don't worry about it.

300
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,540
Songs better not be foreshadowing.

301
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,400
No, no, no, no, no.

302
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,750
No, no, no, no, no.

303
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,560
Why would I, why would I do, well, I can't say that I haven't done karaoke and graduation announcement before.

304
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:33,420
But I didn't, honestly, I don't know, when I did, so when I, when I graduated back in 2021, I didn't, I was like, you know, I was, I was a bitty baby.

305
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,880
I was like, well, if I do karaoke plus graduation announcement, it'll be fun karaoke.

306
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,120
And then it'll be sad announcement, but we'll have fun karaoke.

307
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,520
But I also was just like, well, people care so much.

308
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,300
If I, if I announce that.

309
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,440
So, um, but I guess people cared.

310
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,420
So, and some people came back and that's exciting.

311
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,200
Thank you.

312
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
Thank you guys.

313
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,400
We always miss you when you're.

314
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,760
God, no, no, no, no, no.

315
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,660
I forgot to also, hold on, let me turn off the dono sounds before.

316
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,540
Juggler, I see you before you come through.

317
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm glad that your mom liked my big butt.

318
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,400
I'm so glad.

319
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,160
I'm so happy.

320
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,800
Thank you.

321
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,120
Glad she saw my big butt and liked it.

322
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
Complimented it, even.

323
00:36:36,490 --> 00:37:38,730
I'm so glad That's probably the best Best case scenario It could have gone You know where like Your mom sees you with a With a cup of a girl's butt Anime girl's butt on it And she goes nice butt You know that's actually Probably the best case scenario Hmm Okay let me turn all of these down So sorry save i'll remember to put them up back up later save save save save okay just so that they don't interrupt songs i've i keep i forgot to do it the past couple times i think so doki did a graduation and karaoke too We're just two dummies that think the same way,

324
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,230
I guess.

325
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,850
Oh, man.

326
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,950
I think we're kind of stupid.

327
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:47,770
Maybe.

328
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,790
And Draco, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

329
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,390
As long as you leave 24-7 karaoke on when we're gone.

330
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,030
I will be gone.

331
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,350
I will be gone for a few days next week.

332
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,830
I wasn't gonna do...

333
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:05,130
I'm only gone for a couple days, so I wasn't gonna do a 24-7 karaoke, but I could.

334
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,090
I suppose, or 24-7 stream.

335
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,770
This is really just a few days.

336
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,770
I broke my toe recently, so I can't move around too much.

337
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,530
No!

338
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,610
Fudai pan pan.

339
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,770
I hope you feel better.

340
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,130
I love that punchy pan.

341
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,210
Days, yeah, I'll be gone for five days.

342
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,330
But I'll be back for my birthday.

343
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,130
My birthday's coming up, everybody.

344
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,670
Isn't that crazy?

345
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,670
Isn't that so, so crazy?

346
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,350
Hold on.

347
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,530

355
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,800
These are a bunch of songs that I haven't sung before, huh?

356
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,820
Now I think about it.

357
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,140
A lot of them are, at least.

00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,800

377
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,950
La Vie en Rose.

378
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,110
Oh gosh, I've sung that one before, but I could try.

379
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,390
I don't...

380
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,530

00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:41,790

382
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,670

385
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,410
Abba, let's do Abba, let's do Abba.

386
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,410

392
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:24,090
Friday nights and the lights are low, looking out for a place to go.

393
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,130
Liz!

394
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,430
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing.

395
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,190
to look for a king.

396
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,830
Anybody could be that guy.

397
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,310
Night is young and the music's high.

398
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,530
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine.

399
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,830
You're in the mood for a dance.

400
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:04,670
And when you get the chance, You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, forever 19.

401
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:14,890
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.

402
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:25,800
Oh yeah, you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.

403
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:33,670
We'll see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.

404
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:37,970
Woo!

405
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,340
If you're a teaser, you turn him on.

406
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,760
Leave him burning and then you're gone

407
00:46:59,490 --> 00:46:59,950
too.

408
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,270
You're in the mood for a dance.

409
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:16,270
And when you get the chance, You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, forever 19.

410
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,910
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.

411
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:37,570
Oh yeah, you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.

412
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,890
See that girl?

413
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:47,230
Watch that scene Digging the dancing queen

414
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,090
Digging the dancing queen

415
00:49:02,280 --> 00:50:50,020
I don't wanna talk About the things we've gone through Though it's hurting me Now it's history I've played all my cards And that's what you've done too Nothing more to say No more race to play The winner takes it all The loser standing small the victory that's her destiny i was in your arms thinking i belonged there i figured it made sense building me a fence building me a home thinking i'd be strong there But I was a fool Playing by the rules The gods may throw a dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all The loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain Why should I complain?

416
00:50:51,100 --> 00:51:16,600
Tell me, does she kiss Like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same When she calls your name Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say?

417
00:51:17,580 --> 00:52:24,240
Rules must be obeyed The judges will decide The likes of me abide Spectators of the show Always stay in love The game is on again A lover or friend A big thing or a small The winner takes it all I don't wanna talk If it makes me feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologize If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self-confidence But you see,

418
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:36,180
the winner takes it all The winner takes it all

419
00:52:40,160 --> 00:53:09,900
So the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall throw a dice cold as ice way down here someone dear

420
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,980
Oh, past to fall.

421
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,600
It seems plain.

422
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,240
Why complain?

423
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:30,730
Yeah.

424
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,650
The winner takes it all.

425
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,930
Now lose our eyes to fall.

426
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,530
Do you guys mind if I sing a technical...

427
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,630
Not technical.

428
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,010
A Metal Gear song?

429
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,210
That I've never sung before?

430
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,170
Hold on, let me have some water.

431
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,310
And let me spray my throat.

432
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:54,750
Yeah.

433
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:58,150
Yeah.

434
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,310
A Metal Gear song I've never sung before.

435
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,590
Some of you guys might recognize this.

436
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,550
I heard it recently at MGSCon, and I was like, man, I forgot how good the song was.

437
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,270
So I was like, I kind of want to sing it.

438
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,350
I kind of want to sing it.

439
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,190
Some of you guys might know it.

440
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:27,690

441
00:54:34,790 --> 00:55:13,090
standing on the edge of the crater like the prophets once said And the ashes are all cold now No more bullets And the embers are dead So low Whispers in the air Tell the tales Wait, oh brothers gone

442
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,730
Desolation, devastation.

443
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:28,270
What a mess we made when it all went wrong.

444
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:41,470
Watching from the edge of the circus for the gains to begin.

445
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:56,290
to draw their swords, form their ranks for Armageddon.

446
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:13,850
I'm nuclear, I'm wild, I'm breaking up inside a heart of broken glass.

447
00:56:16,250 --> 00:57:24,510
Defiled Deep inside the abandoned child Standing on the edge of the underworld Looking at the notice And I'm hoping for some miracle to break out of it to escape from I can't remember how sorry whispers in the air tell the tales of a life that's gone desolation devastation What a mess we made when it all went wrong I'm nuclear,

448
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:51,550
I'm wild I'm breaking up inside A heart of broken glass Defiled I'm inside your abandoned child.

449
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:09,010
I should have changed the key.

450
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:14,890
Oh, oh, oh.

451
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,190
I'm nuclear.

452
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,850
I'm wild.

453
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:54,950
I'm breaking up inside a heart of broken glass defile deep inside the appendage I miss

454
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,790
the last one part that's okay though what

455
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:43,400
a good song i feel like this song works so much better than invisible and it actually is is metal gear this is better than invisible

456
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,680

461
01:01:35,860 --> 01:02:24,500

462
01:02:31,320 --> 01:03:09,780
Tonight we'll change our lives It's so good to be by your side But we'll cry We won't give up the fight We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs And they'll think it's just because we're young And we'll feel so alive Throw it away, forget yesterday We'll make the greatest game And won't hear a word they say They don't know us anyway Watch it burn,

463
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:29,080
let it die Cause we are finally free tonight I don't remember how the sprite goes But me answers I will never find But they don't mean a thing tonight

464
01:03:34,180 --> 01:04:28,150
away throw it away forget yesterday we'll make the great escape we won't hear a word they say they don't know us anyway throw it away forget yesterday we'll make the great escape we won't hear a word they say they don't know us anyway Throw it away Forget yesterday We'll make the great escape We won't hear a word they say They don't know us anyway Watch it burn Let it die Cause we are finally free Tonight

465
01:04:52,970 --> 01:05:01,610
That was the great escape Hmm Emo!

466
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,130
Little emo moment.

467
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:04,830
Wait.

468
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,010
What about this one?

469
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:06,910
One second.

470
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,450
Let me remember how it starts.

471
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:10,810
The other one I was like, how does it start?

472
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,290
And then it all came back to me.

473
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:14,810
Like immediately.

474
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:19,430
As soon as I was like, I don't know how to remember how this starts.

475
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,290
Okay, I remember.

476
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:23,090
I remember.

477
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:23,610
I remember.

478
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:25,490
Next song!

479
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,550
When am I going to do the announcement?

480
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:28,550
You guys might wonder.

481
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:38,390
eventually i will do it at the end ish maybe i don't know yet i don't know yet

482
01:05:51,500 --> 01:06:48,300
your subtleties they strangle me i can't explain myself at all and all the wants and all the needs to need at all the walls are breathing my mind's unweaving maybe it's best you leave me alone a weight is lifted on this evening I give the final blow when darkness turns to light it ends tonight It ends tonight A falling star,

483
01:06:48,500 --> 01:07:43,040
at least I fall alone I can't explain what you can explain You're finding things that you didn't know I look at you with such disdain My mind's unweaving Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted On this evening I give the final blow When darkness turns to light It ends tonight It ends tonight Just a little inside Won't make this right.

484
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,620
It's too late to fight.

485
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,380
It's too ends tonight.

486
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,680
It ends tonight.

487
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,740
Now I'm inside.

488
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,120
I don't remember this part.

489
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:57,580
I'll grind.

490
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,340
Better than being on your side.

491
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,480
Wait, oh gosh.

492
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,280
Why did I forget?

493
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:07,760
Light

494
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,750
inside.

495
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:31,820
Darkness turns to light, it ends tonight, it ends tonight.

496
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:40,180
Just a little insight, won't make this right, it's too late to fly.

497
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:52,420
It ends tonight, it ends when darkness turns to light, it ends tonight, it ends tonight.

498
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,800
It ends tonight.

499
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:59,520
Just a little insight won't make this right.

500
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,980
It's too late to fly.

501
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,880
It ends tonight.

502
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,400
It ends tonight.

503
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,740
The darkness turns to light.

504
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,020
It ends tonight.

505
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,490
Sorry, I completely forgot the bridge.

506
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,250

507
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:15,970

514
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:06,910
I'll sing this song.

515
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:08,910
I don't know which one is the one from the movie, though.

516
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,600
I think I have to skip ahead.

517
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,760
I don't know if you can hear me, or if you're even there.

518
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,040
I don't know if you would listen.

519
01:12:42,860 --> 01:13:04,900
To a gypsy's prayer Yes, I know I'm just an outcast I shouldn't speak to you Still I see your face and wonder Were you once an outcast too?

520
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:26,580
God help the outcasts hungry from birth, show them the mercy they don't find on earth.

521
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:33,480
God help my people, we look to you still.

522
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:41,460
God help the outcasts, or nobody will.

523
01:13:46,060 --> 01:14:25,760
I ask for fame I ask for glory to shine on my name I ask for love I can possess I ask for God and His angels to bless me I ask for nothing I can get by, but I know so many less lucky than I.

524
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:33,380
Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden.

525
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:41,140
I thought we all were children of God.

526
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:54,890
Just children of God

527
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:46,050
Let's try it If I don't hit it, I'll be very sad I can't hit the snow, I'll be so sad Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone Gazing at the people down below me All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone, hungry for the histories they showed me.

528
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:53,510
All my life I memorize their faces, knowing them as they will never know me.

529
01:15:54,390 --> 01:16:04,870
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day, not above them, but part of them.

530
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:43,190
Living in the sun Give me one day out there All I ask for one To hold forever Out there Where they all live are Nowhere What I'd give What I dare Just to live one day out there

531
01:16:48,360 --> 01:17:43,160
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives Through the roofs and gables I can see them Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives He must have the gift it is to be them If I was in their skin treasure every instant out there strolling by the sand taste of mourning out there like horde of merrymen who freely walk up out there just one day and then I swear I'll be content with my share won't resent,

532
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:55,760
won't despair all death bent, I won't care I'll have spent one day all there

533
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,940
Man, ever since I got COVID, it's so hard to reach those notes anymore.

534
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,360
Sucks.

535
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,340
Up there from Hunchback Notre Dame.

536
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,740
It's so hard to hit those notes anymore.

537
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,540
Postcards, thank you!

538
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,920

I'll never forgive COVID.

542
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,640
Move along and gives you hell.

543
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,380
Wait, that.

544
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,540
That one gives you hell.

545
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,680
I mean, I mean, me, me, me.

546
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,020
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.

547
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,340
I mean, I mean.

548
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,840
Oh, I don't know.

549
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,800

Here This one's an oldie but a goodie.

593
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:03,660
At least a little bit of distance, there's no way we can't reach out to you.

594
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:09,740
It's always been closed to be closed.

595
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:24,220
I want to see, I can't see, every day, and every day, a strong, Totsky, totsky and it will be a lot of pain.

596
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:39,480
If there are no longer, if there are no ones, if there are no ones that are out there, I can't believe it.

597
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:42,620
I can't believe it.

598
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:52,700
If there are no, there are no reasons to hurt, I know there's a lot of things, but I know it's not going to change.

599
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:58,520

And that's it.

625
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:33,500
The tears are now over the surface and it's going to be so far the voice is not going to be but it's going to

Isn't it so cute?

675
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,710
Ayami Mama did the art.

676
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:11,730
This is a key visual.

677
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:19,770
And there should be merch and special guests and some stuff.

678
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,550
You should come.

679
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,530

681
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:57,290
Here, let me get rid of the set list, too.

682
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:01,450
I got to work with Toei Studios!

683
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:03,890
That's right, like Toei Animation?

684
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:11,850
Yeah, I got to go to Toei, and I got to work with them for this 3D Live.

685
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:13,110
So...

686
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:16,450
It was...

687
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:19,070
Oh my gosh, I've been wanting to say that for so long.

688
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:20,410
I can finally say it.

689
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,590
Because literally the studio that I was...

690
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:26,030
That I was...

691
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,650
I was...

692
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:30,730
Recording in, right next to it.

693
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:31,430
Was...

694
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:35,510
Was where they were doing sound for the latest Common Rider.

695
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:39,570
It was so cool!

696
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:44,410
And they were very, very awesome and very, very nice.

697
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,890
They were...

698
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:48,890
And yeah, I can't wait.

699
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,770
And like I said, there will be special guests.

700
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:56,130

01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:59,790
So I hope you guys will come watch please.

702
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:04,150
It means it is really really big deal to me.

703
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:13,230
Usually I don't push my stuff very hard but this one I really want to push hard so I hope that you guys will come and watch it.

704
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:15,990
Please please please please please please please please.

705
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:17,230
It's free!

706
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:18,570
All you have to do is watch!

707
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,030
It is free.

708
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:24,470
It'll be on my channel.

709
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:25,890
Waiting room is already up.

710
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:28,310
So, um.

711
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:33,750
When I, when I recorded it, it is pre-recorded.

712
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:34,670
I'll just let you guys know that.

713
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:38,870
But it wasn't originally going to be for my birthday.

714
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:40,690
It ended up becoming a birthday thing.

715
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:45,230
Um, so, uh, I also didn't think that I would have like merch or anything for it too.

716
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:47,370
Because everything basically fell apart.

717
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:48,670
Everything fell apart.

718
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,630
But this.

719
01:37:50,790 --> 01:38:10,930

01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:57,590

01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:06,170
So, oh, we'll just put this.

731
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:10,690
And like I said, their merch.

732
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:14,830
Merch will be...

733
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:19,930
I'm still deciding if it will be like after the concert or the day after.

734
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:22,310
So October 2nd, I'll do like a...

735
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:38,050
a birthday celebration stream but this will just be the concert concert we'll do the concert and then the next day so two days of Minto birthday celebration and uh yeah um yeah

736
01:39:41,190 --> 01:40:18,030
it's it's it's my first ever like concert like this um so I'm extremely nervous I'm extremely nervous I've never done like a live like this before so um yeah it's it's um uh it's something I wasn't ever sure that I would be able to do so yeah uh um

737
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,010
Happy, happy!

738
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:25,710

739
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:29,950
Thank you guys for all the Hakusumas, thank you so much.

740
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,690
There is no admission.

741
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:36,890
No, but the waiting room is up already.

742
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:41,590
So, and I'll post about it on Twitter and on YouTube later.

743
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,690
Yeah.

744
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:46,310
Yeah.

745
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:48,570
Yeah.

746
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:50,090
Yay!

747
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:55,030
I figure, well, there's a hashtag for it.

748
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:56,630
Hashtag Minto Haunting 3D.

749
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:02,370
But I'm wondering if I should make a separate hashtag for my birthday.

750
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:13,210
Maybe I'll have one for my birthday, one for this, if you want to post screenshots or clips or whatever.

751
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:21,490
I practiced a lot and I learned a lot of dances and I learned a lot of dances.

752
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:31,050
I was just a lot of fun so yes yes okay

753
01:41:36,490 --> 01:42:23,880
binky you get two hashtags yeah one ticket for binky 3d i know i've been like in 3d before so 3d debut seems a little silly but it's a debut live it's debut live concert it's a concert debut yeah so yeah oh I don't know what else to say sorry I didn't have any like fancy schmancy video or anything for it but that's okay get hype for the announcement October 1st October 1st,

754
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,180
October 1st, October 1st.

755
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:25,920
No!

756
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:39,390
I guess I'll keep singing.

757
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:40,390
Just a few more songs.

758
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,470
My voice is starting to...

759
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:43,810
Let me hold on.

760
01:42:52,830 --> 01:42:56,050
It's funny too, because I started the new Common Rider.

761
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,690
Common Rider is this, this, this!

762
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:01,330
It's so good.

763
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:02,690
Oh my gosh, it's so, so good.

764
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,510
I can't believe my Oshi worked with the studio.

765
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:09,770
Even such legends as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and Visinger.

766
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,470
They were so, so nice.

767
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,550
I really, they were, they were so awesome to work with.

768
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:18,610
Yes, yes.

769
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:22,270
I want to work with them again for sure if I have the chance to.

770
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:27,590
Good morning, Rider.

771
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:37,990
If I ever get a chance, to be on Kamen Rider, that would be...

772
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:39,290
I don't think they would pick me.

773
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:43,610
I don't think they would pick me, but...

774
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:46,330
You know...

775
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:55,770
I think there are much, much bigger VTubers that would probably be featured first, but if they ever need a background role...

776
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:58,770
If they ever need a background role...

777
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:00,310
You know, whatever.

778
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,510
Let me put this...

779
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:12,570
And then oh yeah Look how cute!

780
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,630
Look how cute!

781
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:14,830
Yeah!

782
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:18,770

783
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:19,690

785
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,430

787
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:27,870
Yes.

788
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,430

790
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:33,570
I love this art.

791
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,250
It's so stinking cute.

792
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:37,310
Thank you mama!

793
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:38,930
Mama, love you!

794
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:41,650
Love you, mama.

795
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:43,130
Love you.

796
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:44,030
Love you, mama.

797
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:47,390
Love you, mama.

798
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:48,750
Okie dokie.

799
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,230
Shall we sing Samoa?

800
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:53,630
Actually, hold on.

801
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:55,630
Oh, wait.

802
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:57,870
Wait.

803
01:44:58,990 --> 01:45:00,290
Let me try doing this.

804
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:05,490
I'm gonna...

805
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:07,150
I'm gonna advertise it on my head.

806
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:11,270
Okay.

807
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:13,150
You can't even read it.

808
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:14,530
Wait.

809
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:16,930
Can you read it?

810
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:20,310
You can't even read it.

811
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:23,450
You can't even read it.

812
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,360
Wait, wait!

813
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,480
I have a better idea.

814
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,420
Hold on.

815
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,360
Wait.

816
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,920
Down here, where the camera keeps going.

817
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,720
Down here, where the camera keeps going.

818
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:41,280
Perfect.

819
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:43,580
Yes.

820
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:47,160
Yes, now I have to sing my best song so that people clip it.

821
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:51,660
And then it shows up.

822
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,300
Yes, I'm a marketing genius.

823
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,930
I'm a marketing genius.

824
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,760
Wait, what's a song that I sing well?

825
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:11,800
Okay, guys, what's a song that I sing well?

01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:14,220

Wow!

828
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:28,010

829
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:31,950
Eke and I Borderline

830
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,940
