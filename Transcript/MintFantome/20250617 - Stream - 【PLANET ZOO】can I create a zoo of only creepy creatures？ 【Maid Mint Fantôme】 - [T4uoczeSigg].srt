1
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,300
We're at the zoo.

2
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,320
We're going to the zoo.

3
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,340
Creepy zoo.

4
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,860
Creepy creature zoo.

5
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,460
Hello, everybody.

6
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm Minta.

7
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,760
Minky.

8
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,660
Minky, Minky, Minky.

9
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,900
Minky.

10
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,980
Thank you.

11
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,560
Thank you.

12
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,100
Haven't been able to catch a stream for a while.

13
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,240
I've been super excited to see you at Opcoy.

14
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,140
Thank you.

15
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,680
Little Swamp Girls, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

16
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

17
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,820
Guys... I don't feel well today.

18
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,020
My tummy hurts.

19
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,940
I think I possessed someone who ate something bad.

20
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,860
Now my tummy hurts.

21
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,600
I don't feel well.

22
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Tummy hurt.

23
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,100
That might be on me.

24
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,540
Sorry, that was me.

25
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,880
Sorry about that.

26
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,060
What are you guys eating?

27
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm lactose intolerant at dairy today.

28
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,920
Aw, man.

29
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,820
Aw, man.

30
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,380
My tummy hurt.

31
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
But it's okay.

32
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,580
Just because of that, I'm a little low energy.

33
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,940
Because I've just been like...

34
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,070
Tommy hurt.

35
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,830
Tommy hurt.

36
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,040
But I didn't want to not stream.

37
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,840
So...

38
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah.

39
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,560
Come possess me.

40
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,520
I'll give you good food.

41
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,880
What you got?

42
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,700
What are you...

43
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,060
I...

44
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,440
Will you cook for me?

45
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
But yeah.

46
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,620
Good thing I chose a pretty chill game.

47
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,180
Planet Zoo.

48
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,620
How...

49
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,800
Last time I played Zoo Tycoon.

50
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,080
And...

51
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,400
So many people...

52
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
It didn't really work out for me.

53
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
And so many people were like...

54
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,100
You should try Planet Zoo instead.

55
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,120
Not lactose intolerant, but did...

56
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Why would you tell me that?

57
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,540
This must be a really good zoo...

58
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,900
If it can occupy a whole planet.

59
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah.

60
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,380
Zoo.

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,540
I mean...

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,780
Nakitori.

63
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,640
Nettles, welcome to membership.

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Thank you.

65
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,140
Hope your tummy feels better soon.

66
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,260
Luckily it's a chill game.

67
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:29,720
Yeah.

68
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,120
We're just gonna chill today.

69
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,820
We're gonna chill and...

70
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,820
Um...

71
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,120
Hold on.

72
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Let me spray this real quick.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,020
I'm not sure how long it will be.

74
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,580
It might actually be quite a short stream.

75
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,460
We'll see.

76
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,800
But I wanna...

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,420
I wanna just hang out with you guys.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,620
Since I won't have streams for...

79
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,760
A little bit.

80
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,980
Um...

81
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,380
A little over a week.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,780
So...

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,570
But after...

84
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,500
After Off Kai...

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,730
After this coming trip...

86
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,360
While streams will still be...

87
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,730
A little limited because...

88
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,920
Of my...

89
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,340
Throat.

90
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,300
Um...

91
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,600
I will...

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,640
Not be traveling.

93
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,930
So...

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
Or rather...

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
There will be no more...

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,300
Long Japan trips.

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,740
So...

98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,500
It will feel...

99
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,740
A little more...

100
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,680
Back to normal...

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,460
Than me...

102
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,200
Streaming for two days...

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,280
And then...

104
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,600
Taking off...

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,240
And then...

106
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Streaming for a day...

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,440
And...

108
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,700
You know...

109
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,300
So...

110
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,400
Hmm...

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,920
Today's menu is ravioli.

112
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,460
Ravioli...

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,140
Ravioli...

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,320
Make Minto's...

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Tummy...

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,860
Hurty...

117
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,200
Only...

118
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,900
That's probably what you said.

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,100
Creepy creatures?

120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,740
More like...

121
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,460
Freaky creatures.

122
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,280
Cause...

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Wisps are just that...

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,940
Kind of...

125
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,040
Beast.

126
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,980
That's the virus.

127
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,860
And thank you.

128
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,950
So...

129
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,010
It's been a little awkward.

130
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,710
I feel...

131
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,730
I feel like...

132
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,330
Uh...

133
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,730
Like a failure of a streamer at the moment.

134
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,510
Because I'm not streaming at all.

135
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,810
But...

136
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,230
It will return...

137
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,170
More back to normal.

138
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:15,970
Soon.

139
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,570
Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,890
Soon, soon, soon.

141
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,750
And...

142
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,890
If I see you at Off Kai...

143
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,190
Uh...

144
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,810
This weekend.

145
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,590
Very cool.

146
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,530
I think you may have possessed me.

147
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,790
My throat hurts.

148
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,510
That's not me.

149
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,930
Mine is not contagious.

150
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,110
We love Minto.

151
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,870
Thank you.

152
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,570
Spectral tummy robes.

153
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,710
Don't touch my tummy.

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
But yeah...

155
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Um...

156
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,120
Uh...

157
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
What was I gonna say?

158
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,440
I don't remember.

159
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,300
There's a few things also...

160
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,360
That I will also be...

161
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,860
Doing.

162
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,380
Such as...

163
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,540
Fantastic Reality.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,880
Which is a concert happening during...

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Anime Expo.

166
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,380
But not at Anime Expo.

167
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,200
So you don't need an Anime Expo ticket to get in.

168
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,860
Which...

169
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,560
Oh my god.

170
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,960
I saw the ticket prices today.

171
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,340
For AX.

172
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,640
And I was like...

173
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,240
It's so...

174
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,340
Holy...

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,420
Cow.

176
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,880
It's...

177
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,800
Expensive.

178
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Yikes.

179
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
This is so expensive.

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,140
Hmm...

181
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,620
It's way more...

182
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:50,940
I...

183
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,860
The last time I went to AX...

184
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,440
Well...

185
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,580
Okay.

186
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,980
Hold on.

187
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,120
The last time I went to AX, I got an industry badge.

188
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,220
But I still had to pay for it.

189
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,180
That's how that works.

190
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
It's very strange.

191
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,480
Um...

192
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,980
I guess if...

193
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,320
Unless you're a guest...

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,420
You have to...

195
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,800
You know...

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Pay for it.

197
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,440
Um...

198
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,700
But uh...

199
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,760
The time before that...

200
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,140
I...

201
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,060
I would sometimes work like...

202
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,120
Booths at...

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,860
Anime Expo.

204
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,660
So...

205
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,840
Honestly...

206
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,780
I don't remember ever having to pay for...

207
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,480
A badge.

208
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,000
I never knew how expensive they were.

209
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,760
The only thing you're failing at...

210
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,380
Is disappointing.

211
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Yeah...

212
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm failing at disappointing you.

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,860
Haven't been to AX since 2018.

214
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,740
And it was cramped AF then.

215
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Oh!

216
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,320
Last year!

217
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
It was pretty streamlined.

218
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,040
I thought.

219
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,540
No?

220
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,840
Wasn't that what...

221
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
One of the compliments people had?

222
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,260
So...

223
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,480
So...

224
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,860
They said that it wasn't...

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,760
So...

226
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,580
Bad.

227
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,780
In terms of the lines.

228
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,780
You're failing to convince us of your failure.

229
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,720
2024 was great.

230
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,560
2023 was a bit of a mess.

231
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,480
I didn't go...

232
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,540
I didn't go...

233
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,640
I think I went...

234
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,600
20...

235
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
Either 18 or 2019.

236
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,400
And then obviously I didn't go...

237
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,000
For a couple years because of Covid.

238
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,300
And then I went last year.

239
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,720
Which was great!

240
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,220
That I went last year.

241
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,600
Because I got to meet...

242
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640
Mitsukio-san.

243
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,600
Composer for Blue Archive.

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,700
And I got to give him my card.

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,040
And then I contacted him afterwards.

246
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,940
And I said...

247
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,080
Hey!

248
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,380
I would like to work with you.

249
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,160
Would you be interested in...

250
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,740
Doing my intro song?

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
And then he said...

252
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,780
Ah!

253
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,600
I usually...

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,180
Don't work with like...

255
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Independent people.

256
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,780
But...

257
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,060
I really...

258
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,440
Like that you came up to me at...

259
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,400
Anime Expo.

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,800
And...

261
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,580
I like...

262
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Your look...

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,260
And your vibe.

264
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,520
So I'll work with you.

265
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,540
Ha ha ha!

266
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,900
Ha ha ha!

267
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,280
So it...

268
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,600
Honestly it was worth it.

269
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,280
Just for that.

270
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,060
Ha ha ha!

271
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,940
It was worth it.

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,600
Just for that.

273
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,380
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,280
Ha ha ha!

275
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Arigato!

276
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,580
Arigato!

277
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,220
Choo!

278
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
That's my OCR trash talking.

279
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,300
Watch your mouth.

280
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,460
Ha ha ha!

281
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,060
Ha ha ha!

282
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,640
Taking care of your health isn't failing.

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,420
Well, it's not...

284
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,860
It's...

285
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,400
Me traveling doesn't feel like I'm taking care of my health so much.

286
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,260
But...

287
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,840
But...

288
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,920
I will be gone and...

289
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,160
And...

290
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
My voice will be needed for things...

291
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,180
That I'm gone...

292
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,440
For.

293
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,760
So...

294
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,380
Ha ha ha!

295
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,160
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

297
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,340
Wait, did I miss a birthday?

298
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm so sorry.

299
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,360
Wait, I'm going, I'm going.

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,400
Well, you're not streaming the rest of the week.

301
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,440
Thursday is my birthday!

302
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,420
But more importantly, it's Garfield's birthday.

303
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,880
Could you say happy early birthday to our lord and savior?

304
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,160
Ha ha ha!

305
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,820
Kayvon!

306
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,940
I won't be streaming on your birthday.

308
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,380
But happy birthday!

309
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,440
And happy birthday, Garfield.

310
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,800
I hope he has lots of lasagna.

311
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh my gosh.

312
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,960
Isn't he so lucky that his birthday is not on a Monday?

313
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,940
I can tell you are good.

314
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,860
You are cooking and recovering your voice.

315
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,020
Yeah.

316
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,440
The moment I tuned into streams, my headache disappeared.

317
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,780
Ha!

318
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,780
Wow.

319
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Magic.

320
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,580
That's the moi moi magic.

321
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,600
Obviously.

322
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,020
Actually, traveling and taking care of your mental health is not failing.

323
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,480
Um...

324
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,620
I...

325
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,420
I...

326
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm tired of travel.

327
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,200
Ha ha ha ha!

328
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm tired of travel.

329
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,980
Okay.

330
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,980
Let me create my avatar while I talk.

331
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,060
Ha ha ha ha.

332
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
Ha ha ha ha.

333
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,100
Ha ha ha ha.

334
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,000
Random.

335
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:05,970
Oh.

336
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,670
Oh.

337
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,070
Wow.

338
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,050
I feel like I'm in The Sims all of a sudden.

339
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,570
Hmm.

340
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,410
Teen.

341
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:13,490
Teen.

342
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,310
I'm...

343
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm...

344
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,550
I'm...

345
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,750
I'm forever...

346
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,730
Uh...

347
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,570
Forever 19.

348
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,710
So...

349
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,410
Well, technically that's teen.

350
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,690
Cause it has...

351
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,730
Nineteen.

352
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,470
But...

353
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,030
Um...

354
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,410
That's an adult.

355
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,850
Ha ha ha ha.

356
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,930
Ha ha ha.

357
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,050
Can you make eat Tina here?

358
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,470
Ha!

359
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,630
Willing well.

360
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,190
You read my mind!

361
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,910
Uh...

362
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,330
What is this?

363
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,570
Slim or...

364
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,270
Ha ha ha.

365
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,270
Ha ha.

366
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,090
This is so...

367
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,270
What?

368
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,070
You can be slim or you can be large.

369
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,040
Ha ha ha.

370
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,300
Ha ha.

371
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,520
Okay.

372
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,040
That's one way to put it.

373
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
I guess.

374
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,960
Ha ha ha.

375
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,780
Let's see if we can make eat Tina.

376
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,700
Can we...

377
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh.

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,060
Wait.

379
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,380
Look at them chompers.

380
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,800
Wait.

381
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,700
She's got like little vampire teeth.

382
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,640
Wait.

383
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,960
Where are your vampire teeth?

384
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,780
Where are your vampire teeth?

385
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,080
I could see them in this tiny little preview.

386
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
Why is she so shocked?

387
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,280
You know what?

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,020
Actually I would be shocked too if I had instant plastic surgery.

389
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,140
I think that's just the head shape.

390
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,780
Oh...

391
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,840
You're right.

392
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,420
Okay.

393
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,620
Eat Tina has...

394
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,380
Oh.

395
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,540
Uh...

396
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,400
Pretty...

397
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,340
It's like...

398
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,720
Her head is like the shape of a chestnut.

399
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,260
Wait.

400
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,460
An upside down chestnut.

401
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,680
So it's...

402
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,540
Big on the top and then...

403
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,740
Becomes small.

404
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,780
I think this might be our closest one.

405
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,480
What is this?

406
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,760
Uh-huh.

407
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,360
Oh.

408
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:03,880
Cute.

409
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,200
Wait.

410
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,380
That's actually so cute.

411
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh.

412
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,980
This is hair.

413
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,340
I thought it was like...

414
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,920
The wrinkles.

415
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,860
So you asked what kind of animal you'd be not too long ago.

416
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,540
What kind of...

417
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,660
What animal do you think you'd be then?

418
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,060
I don't know.

419
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,540
That's why I asked.

420
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,480
I was like...

421
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,400
What kind of animal energy do I give?

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,780
Many people said minky.

423
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,900
Or like a mink.

424
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,700
And of course some people said monkey.

425
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,940
Cause minky.

426
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,340
Hmm.

427
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,680
I got a new bookshelf for my Choba figure.

428
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,720
Oh my gosh.

429
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,140
Maya.

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,720
The one where she's on the telephone pole.

431
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm so jealous.

432
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,260
Actually, I wanted that figure so bad.

433
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,760
But when I saw it, it was...

434
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,740
It was sold out.

435
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,220
How...

436
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,780
Wait, how do I get out of here?

437
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,580
Okay, there we go.

438
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
I think this is the most...

439
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,260
Actually, I think I want to make me.

440
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,800
I think I want to make me.

441
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,880
It's my...

442
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
What's my head shape?

443
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,780
I want to have vampire teeth.

444
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,370
I guess this looks kind of...

445
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,990
Why does she look so old?

446
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,990
Why are all these hairstyles like...

447
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,570
Old lady?

448
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,770
Like look at that.

449
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,110
I look like a grandma.

450
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,870
Maybe the ponytail is the nicest one.

451
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,130
Oh, this is also a ponytail.

452
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,610
I thought it was Karen.

453
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,910
You got Karen one.

454
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,370
Karen two.

455
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,570
We all know Minky 3.0 has a huge forehead.

456
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,930
Oh, I thought you meant about my second outfit.

457
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,530
I was like, no!

458
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,310
You can't see my forehead in my next outfit.

459
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,690
Maybe I can make it...

460
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,030
Hold on.

461
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,550
What's...

462
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,310
Wait, what does this do?

463
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,270
Oh.

464
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,730
Oh, indeed.

465
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,330
Oh.

466
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,770
Oh.

467
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,860
Oh.

468
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,020
Why does it sound like a skelly man?

469
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,020
Minecraft skelly man.

470
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,360
Look.

471
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
You can become Cruella de Vil.

472
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,960
This one is just absolute Karen territory.

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,040
Are there more colors or just pink?

474
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,080
Just...

475
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,540
Just...

476
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,640
Just this?

477
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,560
I don't know what to go with.

478
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,740
All of these are bad.

479
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,260
All of these are bad.

480
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,740
Some of these are so bad.

481
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,460
Oh my god.

482
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
It gets worse.

483
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,260
Here, we'll give ourselves some cool glasses.

484
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,400
And a ponytail.

485
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,160
I would like to speak to the...

486
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,400
To the designer of this game.

487
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,760
What the hell is this?

488
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,480
What is this shirt?

489
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,780
What kind of design is this?

490
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,580
Oh, look.

491
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh, we can have a spooky t-shirt.

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,640
Wait, this is great.

493
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
We'll have a spooky tee.

494
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,580
It's like a monkey.

495
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,340
Womb shirt.

496
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,820
Maybe a kangaroo.

497
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,900
If it's supposed to be a kangaroo...

498
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,160
Like a kangaroo, they should have like a little...

499
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,920
Baby kangaroo peeking out.

500
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,920
Wait, the turtleneck is kind of nice.

501
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,180
But we'll go with the spooky shirt.

502
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,400
When you have a xenomorph in your belly.

503
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,320
Wow.

504
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,740
Legs.

505
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,680
These shorts are...

506
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,300
Wait.

507
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,660
Oh, wow.

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
I guess if this is like a uniform, it works, right?

509
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,620
Wait, does this come with matching pants?

510
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,480
Oh, it does!

511
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,060
Okay, I guess we know what we're wearing.

512
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,620
Wait, why does it show something different here?

513
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,220
Shows a bunch of eyeballs.

514
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,830
Oh!

515
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,110
Oh!

516
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,210
Clown!

517
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,670
Why are these the default colors?

518
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,510
Dangerously cheesy.

519
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,930
That brown shirt is maternity wear.

520
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,990
It's got a Death Stranding style window on the belly.

521
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,650
So you can see BB!

522
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,710
I'm kind of sad that everything happened so...

523
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,610
Oh my god.

524
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,430
Wait.

525
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,330
This is awesome.

526
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,810
Everything happened so...

527
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,450
Much at once so that I couldn't...

528
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,910
Play Death Stranding in time for the release.

529
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,850
Wait!

530
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,830
A snake!

531
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,850
Oh, that's not a snake.

532
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,450
That's the logo for Planet Zoo.

533
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,450
Okay, I will go with the frog.

534
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,910
Wait, what about my hair?

535
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,930
Can I change my hair then?

536
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,530
Oh, nope.

537
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,090
You're stuck with it.

538
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,990
Why is there a little dot here?

539
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,570
Okay.

540
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,170
I guess I must accept this.

541
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,650
Because that's what it says.

542
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,110
Because that's what it says.

543
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,850
Except...

544
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm accepting...

545
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,730
Like...

546
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,270
Wow.

547
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,950
These are some...

548
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,590
Crazy hats.

549
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,610
Wait, what's this one?

550
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,130
Oh, it is ice cream!

551
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,170
You could just have a big old...

552
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,030
Scoop of ice cream.

553
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,830
Everybody wants a hat of...

554
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,710
Brown ice cream.

555
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,650
Definitely doesn't look like anything else on top of your head.

556
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,950
Are you sure?

557
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,770
There she goes!

558
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,230
So, I should also say...

559
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,450
I've never played this game before.

560
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,650
So...

561
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,210
Place your avatar HQ.

562
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,110
The HQ is where other players will see your avatar and access any zoos or boop...

563
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,490
Blueprints you have...

564
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:13,810
Sh...

565
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,890
I said booprints.

566
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,410
I'm a ghost!

567
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,010
Position your avatar anywhere on the globe.

568
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,250
You can edit the avatar HQ position later.

569
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,030
Okay, there's this one island.

570
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,450
I think it's...

571
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,230
I don't think that's it.

572
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,550
It's about here, I believe.

573
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,530
It's like the most remote island in the world.

574
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,550
The closest human beings to it are...

575
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,590
Are...

576
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,730
The humans on the ISS.

577
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,790
So...

578
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,010
We'll go there.

579
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,030
Is it Point Nemo?

580
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,950
I don't remember the name.

581
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,170
Let me Google.

582
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,110
Perfect place for a zoo.

583
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,710
Exactly!

584
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,810
Whoa.

585
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,770
Point...

586
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,330
Nemo...

587
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,130
South Pacific Ocean.

588
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,070
Yeah.

589
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,510
I guess like...

590
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,210
We'll do like...

591
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,670
Right here.

592
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,890
Are you sure?

593
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,290
Yeah.

594
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,270
Okay!

595
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,590
Hi!

596
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,030
What should we do?

597
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,490
Career?

598
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,250
Progressor?

599
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,670
Career?

600
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,750
And...

601
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,690
Hey!

602
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,770
Who are you?

603
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,110
Oh my god!

604
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,250
Oh my god.

605
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,930
Oh my god.

606
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,430
People are invading.

607
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,370
Yeah, I got an achievement for placing my person.

608
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,670
We could do career.

609
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,490
We could do...

610
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,670
I don't think I wanna do timed.

611
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,850
Build zoos all over the world and trade your animals online.

612
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,790
Build your zoos offline with a full economy and challenges.

613
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,230
Sandbox!

614
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,890
Maybe Sandbox mode would be good.

615
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,290
Yeah, let's just do that so we can build the...

616
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,150
Zoo of my dreams.

617
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,850
Scenario zoo.

618
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,830
Goodwin house.

619
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,890
We need at least one star on the previous levels.

620
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,130
Hope sa- Wait!

621
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,870
Castle Myers.

622
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,730
This looks spooky.

623
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,730
Easter Island Minto Zoo.

624
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,750
Zoo in the middle of the ocean.

625
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,810
Just like Mother Base.

626
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,230
Exactly!

627
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,850
When I start fultoning all the animals, this is where they go.

628
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,070
Creepy zoo.

629
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
Clear the zoo of all scenario items.

630
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,200
What's the difficulty?

631
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,400
I mean...

632
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,020
Animals never get bored of enrichment items.

633
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,470
Guests won't request refuds.

634
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,430
Sorry, I was checking up on my cat.

635
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,570
I guess we'll try it.

636
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,470
You know what, whatever.

637
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,850
I'm just here to vibe today.

638
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,360
Why does it sound like a Coca-Cola commercial?

639
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
Do-do-dee.

640
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,400
New sandbox settings.

641
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,600
More settings.

642
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,740
Oh, by the way.

643
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,920
I have this castle area because I bought DLC.

644
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,400
This game...

645
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,540
Has, first of all, so much DLC.

646
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,140
At first I was like...

647
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,440
It's kind of pricey.

648
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,260
But...

649
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,300
I really just wanted...

650
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,780
Your zoo has no vets to deal with all the...

651
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,660
Ill or...

652
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,540
I have...

653
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,360
Ill animals?

654
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,800
There's so much DLC and it's...

655
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,780
Expensive!

656
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,180
To get all the DLC for this game?

657
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
It's...

658
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,020
Two...

659
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,140
Two hundred dollars!

660
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,010
What?!

661
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,090
There!

662
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,670
It's nuts!

663
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,790
Yeah...

664
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,810
So I just bought one.

665
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,370
Um...

666
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,290
Can I move...

667
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,590
Whoa!

668
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,610
Oh, whoa, whoa!

669
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,310
Uh...

670
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,090
How do I...

671
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,570
Uh...

672
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,230
Oh, gosh.

673
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,090
Oh, golly.

674
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,970
How do I move the camera?

675
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,550
I don't know anything right now.

676
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,790
Basic controls!

677
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,470
Select...

678
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,310
Okay...

679
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,230
Cancel...

680
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,190
Undo...

681
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,950
Control Z...

682
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,350
Redo...

683
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,070
Control Y...

684
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,290
Okay...

685
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:06,810
Uh...

686
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,690
Six out of...

687
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,470
Twenty-three!

688
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,170
Okay...

689
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:09,730
Oh, shift!

690
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,470
Oh!

691
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:12,490
Just kidding.

692
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,510
I'm pressing shift.

693
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,910
Oh!

694
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,330
Oh!

695
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,770
Oh!

696
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,850
Oh!

697
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,630
Oh!

698
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,870
Oh!

699
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,010
Oh!

700
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,770
There's a crime scene.

701
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,250
What is happening?

702
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,550
Uh...

703
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:27,750
Oh!

704
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,370
Oh!

705
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,370
Uh...

706
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:29,850
Oh, gosh.

707
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:30,910
Okay...

708
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,850
I won't get...

709
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,550
I'm not gonna get...

710
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,090
I'm not gonna get sick.

711
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,710
Why if I press...

712
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,970
Oh!

713
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,170
My fingers weren't on...

714
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,610
I was like...

715
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,870
Why if I press...

716
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,330
Back?

717
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,450
It's going...

718
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,750
Or if I press...

719
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,290
Left?

720
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,390
Left?

721
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,230
It's going back!

722
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,630
Because my fingers weren't on...

723
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,130
Washed up!

724
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,950
Oh, my bad!

725
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,380
Where's the entrance to this park?

726
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,540
Why are there so many...

727
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,740
Dead little foxes?

728
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,520
Rotate 90 degrees...

729
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,520
Oh, that didn't do anything...

730
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,840
How do I like...

731
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,810
How do I like...

732
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:23,910
Turn?

733
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,350
How do I like...

734
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,690
Turn around?

735
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,800
Fox die?

736
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,460
Maybe I guess like this.

737
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,000
Okay, so this is the entrance, no?

738
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,740
No.

739
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,780
Wait, this is the entrance.

740
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,680
Yeah, this is...

741
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,220
Where we zoomed through.

742
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,360
How are people getting here?

743
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,080
We don't have a parking lot.

744
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,060
We've got nothing.

745
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,240
Go do the tutorial?

746
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,660
I didn't see a tutorial.

747
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,480
Who is Zohan?

748
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
Why is he taking over my...

749
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,540
My...

750
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,720
My zoo?

751
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,380
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 uses models from Planet Zoo to populate the world with animals.

752
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,980
That's so cute, actually.

753
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
Let's see what we got going on here.

754
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,680
Do I have any animals?

755
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,500
I have fake animals.

756
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,760
It's paper mache wombat.

757
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,840
That thing's gonna break.

758
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Probably, right?

759
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,200
The thing...

760
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,900
All it has to do is rain once.

761
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,420
And it's gonna be Jell-O.

762
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,000
Wow.

763
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,560
This place is actually really cute.

764
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,660
I didn't have the box...

765
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:02,980
I...

766
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,220
Wait.

767
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,580
I haven't had the...

768
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,660
I don't have to build anything.

769
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,880
Maybe I should have sandboxed with, like, nothing.

770
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,140
Wait, there's...

771
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,900
There's everything here that anybody could ever need.

772
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,020
Who's the king?

773
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,440
Who the hell is a Vinny?

774
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Get out of my zoo.

775
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,840
It's not ready yet.

776
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,680
This is a RPG city.

777
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,100
Oh, you guys seen that Jenny Nicholson video about that...

778
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,100
Ever...

779
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,380
Ever...

780
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,520
Evermore...

781
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,620
Everquest...

782
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,660
What was that place called?

783
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,140
Evermore?

784
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,680
Okay, I'm gonna zoom out some more so we can get, like, a full view.

786
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,360
Where am I supposed to put any exhibits?

787
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,620
Down in the caves?

788
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,360
Wait, wait, wait.

789
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,440
What is this?

790
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,220
A generator?

791
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,560
A transformer?

792
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,620
Robots in disguise.

793
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,520
Wait, what's down here?

794
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Love this game after seeing Iggyo play it.

795
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,640
I don't know who that is.

796
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,980
Is my zoo open?

797
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,320
They can come in and see the cute fake animals.

798
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,860
Oh, sorry.

799
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm trying to get inside the cave.

800
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,480
Oh, what?

801
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,260
Who are you people?

802
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,620
What?

803
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,300
What a beautiful place.

804
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,980
Wait, where did all these people come from?

805
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
I thought we only had one visitor.

806
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,320
Are you also going home?

807
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,820
Our place is not...

808
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,420
Wait, is this the exit up here?

809
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,820
How do you leave?

810
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,400
I don't think this is the exit, you guys.

811
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,560
How are you gonna get home?

812
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,380
Beep boop.

813
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,680
This is...this feels like hard mode.

814
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,980
Wait, they're going this way.

815
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,060
What are you doing?

816
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,940
You're just wandering.

817
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,800
Strangest episode of Beast Wars ever.

818
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,880
Minto's spit and greet line leaked.

819
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,240
Shut up.

820
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,140
It feels so magical and beautiful.

821
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,720
Why are there such so many people though?

822
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,300
They seem to like the park.

823
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,000
Everybody's got big ol' smiles.

824
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,020
What are you saying?

825
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,160
Oh, you're going home.

826
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,860
Oh, shoot.

827
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,980
I forgot how to go up again.

828
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,960
Please send me up.

829
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,100
Oh.

830
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,660
Send me up.

831
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,250
Where did all these people come from is my question.

832
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,350
How did they get inside?

833
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,710
Did they travel?

834
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,290
Well...

835
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,230
I...I...

836
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,870
We definitely didn't see them travel from in here.

837
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,530
Shift up down.

838
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,010
Oh, yes.

839
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,610
Thank you.

840
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,910
I should go do the tutorial, huh?

841
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,890
Let's go to the tutorial.

842
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,770
It's fine, we didn't do anything.

843
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,690
We just looked around.

844
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,170
I'm gonna do the tutorial.

845
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:14,950
Update.

846
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,090
Education stations.

847
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,170
Oh my gosh.

848
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,530
One out of 41.

849
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,470
Piebaldism.

850
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,810
A new special coat jean.

851
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,880
My... my deer are going to go bald.

852
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,840
Exhibit talks.

853
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,440
Exhibit camera.

854
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,920
That's fun.

855
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,890
Looking forward to the 100 men versus 1 gorilla attraction.

856
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,300
We can make that right now.

857
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,300
Where is the tutorial?

858
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,220
Maybe in the career.

859
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,080
No.

860
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,020
This game is acting like I'm a genius or something.

861
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,820
Career first level.

862
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,540
Oh really?

863
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,100
Okay.

864
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:09,760
Oh.

865
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,580
Some would say bald.

866
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,290
Fully trained a member of staff.

867
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,050
Yeah, I did that.

868
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,950
We're at university.

869
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,450
Oh, it's voiced.

870
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,790
I have a habit of slipping back into the Planko language.

871
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,810
It's good to finally meet you in person.

872
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:01,830
I'm Bernard.

873
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,910
Although I insist you call me Bernie.

874
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,590
Bernie.

875
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,890
The only person who calls me Bernard is my wife.

876
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,950
And even then, only when I've tracked elephant dung into the carpet.

877
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:13,770
Ew.

878
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,350
They don't take off your shoes?

879
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:15,830
Bad human.

880
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,990
I own several zoos.

881
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,750
But I always like to show people the robes here at my home.

882
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,270
Can't put your own fan base in a zoo.

883
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,450
Watch me.

884
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,090
This is the first zoo I ever opened.

885
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,310
And a source of great pride for me.

886
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,610
And prides.

887
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,070
Thanks to a lion breeding program we ran in the 80s.

888
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,690
Oh, I'm watching that lion take a shit.

889
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,810
But we're in the middle of a big renovation.

890
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,830
And that's where you come in.

891
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,770
Sadly, our old contractor had to retire after the development of fur allergy.

892
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,570
No!

893
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,570
The devil kept sneezing his dentures into the lion habitat.

894
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,390
That's nature, I guess.

895
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,490
So, it's up to you to finish everything off.

896
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,410
Don't worry though.

897
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,150
I'm not completely throwing you in at the deep end.

898
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:54,610
Okay.

899
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,450
My head keeper, Nancy Jones, will be lending a helping hand.

900
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,810
Oh my god, sometimes I watch nature live cams.

901
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:02,610
And she would expect you to be too.

902
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,450
And there's this one of a watering hole in Africa.

903
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,130
But I'm sure we get along with the house on fire.

904
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,070
Even better.

905
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,090
I think it's...

906
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,090
One that isn't on fire.

907
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,890
Less shouting that way.

908
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,230
And I'm...

909
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,690
And I'm...

910
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,670
Hello there.

911
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,650
From that rosy, fresh face of yours, I'm guessing...

912
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,370
But today...

913
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,250
You're Bernie's new hire.

914
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,510
Good.

915
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,570
Now, I hope you're ready to ditch your diploma, because we're about to get...

916
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,470
Let me be a one.

917
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

918
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,610
But before we begin the real work...

919
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,430
I watched that one.

920
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,150
How about we familiarize you with it?

921
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:30,530
And today...

922
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,230
By learning how to fly around it.

923
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,810
And visiting some of our beautiful animals.

924
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,370
Okay.

925
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,650
We'll start by popping over and having a look-see at the grizzly bears in their habitat.

926
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,210
Today...

927
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,690
Uh...

928
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,550
It was just...

929
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,770
Covered entirely by a spider for like hours.

930
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,070
The spider got really comfy and was like, yep.

931
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,230
Okay.

932
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,210
So we're gonna go find the grizzly bears, which are totally highlighted.

933
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,610
I'm here.

934
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:01,790
Oh.

935
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:06,870
Did you know that grizzly bears, also known as Ursus Arctos Horribilis...

936
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,590
How do I turn around?

937
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,850
Can hibernate for up to seven months a year.

938
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,410
Oh, here we go.

939
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,190
Oh.

940
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,930
But then again, given the chance, I think a lot of people would do that too.

941
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,590
Ha ha ha.

942
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:17,750
So true.

943
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,910
Select one of the bears, and you'll bring up its information panel.

944
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,570
Oh, there's an animal camera.

945
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,410
Enter grizzly bear animal camera.

946
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:26,890
Possession.

947
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,630
I will possess this guy's body.

948
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:35,050
This is where you can find out all kinds of information about your animal.

949
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,790
The most important thing being its overall welfare.

950
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,250
We'll learn more about animal welfare today as we go through your objectives.

951
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,310
But for now, let's enjoy this magnificent animal.

952
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,730
Why don't you select the camera at the bottom of its information panel?

953
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,230
What is this?

954
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,850
What is this?

955
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,670
See now, this is a fantastic way to get a close look at your animals.

956
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,710
Wait, I'm so far away.

957
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,750
You can also get this view of an animal by simply double clicking on it.

958
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,930
Okay, when you're ready, let's pop over to the other side of the zoo.

959
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,750
Look at him go.

960
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,830
I've marked their location for you to find.

961
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,130
Wow, this is just like my animal cameras, but better.

962
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,890
Oh, so cute.

963
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,130
Are you going to sleep?

964
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,160
He's so cute.

965
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I love how in these Nat games they talk.

966
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,760
Super chill like a Nat Geo documentary.

967
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,760
Yeah, right.

968
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,120
We got a friend.

969
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,340
Okay, I thought he was going to...

970
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,100
I keep thinking they're going to poo in their beds, you know.

971
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,920
How do I get out of the bed?

972
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,920
Okay, here we go.

973
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,580
Alright.

974
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,200
Alright.

975
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,340
Nice.

976
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,600
Alright.

977
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,160
Locate the West African lion exhibit.

978
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,040
Goodbye, Zachary.

979
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,940
Wait, what is this?

980
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,800
A balloon!

981
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,640
Goodbye.

982
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,880
Okay, over there.

983
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,570
Come on, we put the freak phantom.

984
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,130
We'll put him.

985
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,430
Panfera, Leo, Leo.

986
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,990
All the West African lion to you and me.

987
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,970
Lions are the most social of the big cats.

988
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,510
And they can be as many as 40 lions in a pride.

989
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,930
Although cats of that size are pretty rare.

990
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,250
As Bernie would say, those lions are rawsome.

991
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,990
Rawsome.

992
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,410
There's only two in here?

993
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,870
Anyway, how about we get started on those objectives?

994
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,150
Come on, let's head over to an empty habitat.

995
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,810
Oh, I think that's a fake zebra.

996
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,010
Oh, can I possess the person?

997
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,190
No.

998
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,570
Oh wait, yes I can.

999
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,060
What are you doing?

1000
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,040
Mister?

1001
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,500
Okay.

1002
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Let's see.

1003
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,700
What were our objectives?

1004
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,980
I lost them.

1005
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,820
Uh oh, wait.

1006
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,700
Oh no.

1007
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,240
Ma'am?

1008
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,080
Oh, I found them.

1009
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,540
Just kidding.

1010
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,900
Uh, locate the empty habitat.

1011
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,220
How do I go up?

1012
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,480
Why do people keep...

1013
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,040
Keep losing their balloons?

1014
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,860
Oh my gosh.

1015
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm so bad at moving this camera.

1016
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,260
Damn, this place is crowded.

1017
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,260
Okay, there we go.

1018
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:47,580
There we go.

1019
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:48,860
Empty.

1020
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,260
There.

1021
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,060
This is a crowded zoo.

1022
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,500
As you can see, it's a lovely space for animals, but it's missing a certain something.

1023
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,440
An animal?

1024
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,800
Two somethings.

1025
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,840
Warthogs.

1026
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,300
Oh.

1027
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
So I'd like you to adopt a pair of them.

1028
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,820
Why can't I adopt what I want?

1029
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,700
We need to open the animal market, which is in the animal trading section.

1030
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,360
Okay.

1031
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,480
Animal trading.

1032
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:17,960
There we are.

1033
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,600
A pair of perfectly splendid Warthogs for our zoo.

1034
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,680
Just click on them and select adopt from the side menu.

1035
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,480
Normally the animal exchange would be full of animals, but I've emptied out the market while you learn how it works.

1036
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,380
I want to.

1037
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,420
The last thing I made is you accidentally ordering a dozen elephants.

1038
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,940
That's what I wanted to do.

1039
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:42,400
When you adopt an animal, it's automatically placed in the trade center, where they're held until you're ready to move them into their habitat.

1040
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:42,920
Okay.

1041
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,780
As it happens, you are.

1042
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,840
So how about you move them into their new home?

1043
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,640
Send.

1044
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,820
Okay.

1045
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,700
Send.

1046
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,460
When you ask for an animal to be moved into a habitat, your caretakers will go to the trade center.

1047
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,220
collect your animal and deliver them to your selected habitat.

1048
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,740
And mark the trade center's location.

1049
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,340
So let's go and watch the caretakers in action.

1050
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,600
Where?

1051
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:09,940
Where?

1052
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:10,400
Where?

1053
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,460
Um.

1054
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,140
Uh.

1055
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,180
Oh.

1056
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,680
Right there.

1057
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:16,960
Right there.

1058
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,320
Right there.

1059
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,610
Oh my god.

1060
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:21,970
Whoa.

1061
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,610
Whoa.

1062
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,030
Whoa.

1063
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,810
They'll move those animals to their destination as fast as possible.

1064
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,150
Oh my god.

1065
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,330
It's so good without...

1066
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,070
That warthog is getting shaken up.

1067
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,010
Oh my god.

1068
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:34,970
Oh my god.

1069
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:41,090
But I am assured by a person of good standing that these warthogs are in the very rudest of health.

1070
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,270
Right.

1071
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,410
Let's get the warthogs habitat finished up so we can keep...

1072
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,490
Oh he's running around.

1073
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,290
Oh my god.

1074
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,590
And he throws them in the air.

1075
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,890
It's hungry and thirsty.

1076
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,970
That way you'll know exactly what areas need to be addressed.

1077
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,050
Don't worry if that's a lot to remember.

1078
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,750
You can always check the zoopedia for more information.

1079
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,510
Okay.

1080
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,030
So we need more...

1081
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,370
Hold on my head.

1082
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,570
Let's start by making sure we're taking care of the warthogs' nutrition welfare.

1083
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,010
To do this, we'll need to place a food station and a drinking station.

1084
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,430
Now, each animal requires a different type of feeding station.

1085
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,030
Oh wow.

1086
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,290
And for the warthogs, it's a small feeding trough.

1087
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,190
So let's add one of those and a water bowl.

1088
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:41,350
Okay.

1089
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:42,450
How?

1090
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,350
Habitat?

1091
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,910
Oh, food trough.

1092
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,910
Small.

1093
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,690
We'll put it close to so that everybody can watch him eat.

1094
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,490
And then, um, the large water bowl.

1095
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,090
Animals also require stimulation to keep them happy.

1096
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,970
Let's add a lovely mud bath for the warthogs to roll around in.

1097
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,110
That bath will count towards their enrichment welfare.

1098
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,470
Specifically, their toy enrichment welfare.

1099
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:13,850
Oh wow!

1100
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,650
This is huge!

1101
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:15,350
Okay.

1102
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:15,930
Nice.

1103
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:17,170
Oh!

1104
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,350
Nice work!

1105
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,330
You've got a knack for this, I see.

1106
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,070
Okay, I feel like I already know how to play this game.

1107
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:25,570
Now, I will contract to have to leave in a hurry, so this place is in a pharaoh state.

1108
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,910
Unfinished thingamajigs and wotsits all over the shop.

1109
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:32,470
But the first thing we need to finish is the ostrich habitat.

1110
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,290
It's over near the hippos.

1111
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,890
Wait, but I'm...

1112
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,110
These guys have nothing.

1113
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,290
These guys need more grass.

1114
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,670
They want more long grass.

1115
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,070
Oh wait, there's nothing available.

1116
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,930
They want more soil?

1117
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,750
Oh wait, they have too much soil.

1118
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,590
Animal needs less soil.

1119
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,890
They're unhappy!

1120
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,130
They're hungry and thirsty!

1121
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,530
Oh, they're thirsty!

1122
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,550
Terrain bottom right.

1123
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,210
Oh, I see it.

1124
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:04,590
Thank you.

1125
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,050
So, they want some long grass.

1126
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,410
Is this too much?

1127
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,630
Size 2.

1128
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,210
Uh...

1129
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:16,970
Am I doing it?

1130
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,590
I don't think I am.

1131
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,310
Uh...

1132
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:29,870
Um...

1133
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,090
No!

1134
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,110
No!

1135
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,530
Maybe it's locked for now.

1136
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,210
It might be.

1137
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,730
Okay.

1138
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,330
What did you want me to do?

1139
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,130
What did you want me to do?

1140
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,550
Oh!

1141
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,570
The ostrich.

1142
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,490
So, there's paths here.

1143
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,130
Terrain.

1144
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,270
Blueprints.

1145
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:48,830
Construction.

1146
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,590
Facilities.

1147
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,090
Okay.

1148
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,450
Ostrich.

1149
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,490
Where are they?

1150
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,710
Oh, before we actually start building our ostrich habitat...

1151
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:04,210
Oh!

1152
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,750
It's not finished.

1153
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,510
Let's pause the game.

1154
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,790
Just click the pause button in the bottom right corner.

1155
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,310
Nan...

1156
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,210
Nancy, is this a game to you?

1157
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,450
Am I a joke?

1158
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,750
Is this a game to you?

1159
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,130
Animals are starving.

1160
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,270
That's more like it.

1161
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,270
A quick break.

1162
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,670
Sometimes it's a good idea to pause the game whilst you're doing something which requires your concentration.

1163
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,710
Because it'll stop the zoo spinning out of control while you're looking the other way.

1164
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,430
Let's keep the game paused while we get this ostrich habitat built.

1165
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,470
Okay.

1166
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:35,850
Okay.

1167
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,490
Job number one here is to add a habitat gate before we complete the barrier.

1168
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:41,450
Okay.

1169
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,210
Every habitat needs a habitat gate.

1170
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,230
Ooh, this guy almost walked in.

1171
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,850
After all, how else would the keepers get in and out?

1172
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,050
Just make sure it's hooked up to the path so the keepers can reach it.

1173
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:50,430
Okay.

1174
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,510
Vivico, thanks so much for the vibe.

1175
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,850
Gifted.

1176
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:54,250
Thank you.

1177
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,370
I'm gonna make it.

1178
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,270
We're gonna...

1179
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:56,710
We're gonna...

1180
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,410
We're saving money.

1181
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,110
What?

1182
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,050
I can't go diagonal.

1183
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,070
What the?

1184
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,030
Oh, yes I can.

1185
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,670
Uh...

1186
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,970
What do you want me to do?

1187
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,990
Obstructed.

1188
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,790
By what?

1189
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,970
Outside placement area.

1190
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,870
Huh?

1191
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,710
Oh, I think I messed up.

1192
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,530
Oh, here we go.

1193
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,670
No?

1194
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,550
I messed up.

1195
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,130
There's a control Z.

1196
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,210
There we go.

1197
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:25,470
Okay.

1198
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,100
Connect the habitat to the path.

1199
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,300
Maybe if we drive from this end.

1200
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,160
What is outside placement area?

1201
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,140
What do you mean by that?

1202
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,740
Oh, I'm wanting me to add the gate first.

1203
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,460
What?

1204
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,480
What?

1205
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,100
Oh...

1206
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,160
I see, I see.

1207
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,920
They're just being finicky.

1208
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,440
Obstructed!

1209
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,400
Okay, uh...

1210
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,420
Never...

1211
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:02,780
Oh?

1212
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,520
Oh, thank you.

1213
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:07,960
Oh, thank you.

1214
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,520
I tried inside the glowing area.

1215
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,840
It said it's obstructed.

1216
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,540
What?

1217
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,420
It's so picky.

1218
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,440
Right!

1219
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,180
Okay.

1220
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,900
Let's complete the perimeter barrier so we can adopt us some ostriches.

1221
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,320
Okay.

1222
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,440
I've marked out an area for you to use, so I'd like you to finish off the perimeter using the brick barrier.

1223
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,420
Okay.

1224
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,460
Aw, I'm even getting policed in the...

1225
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:38,980
Okay, hold on.

1226
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,000
We'll make it zig-zag.

1227
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,920
Kind of like a cool...

1228
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:43,660
Future...

1229
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,840
I can't see.

1230
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,620
Oh, gosh.

1231
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,660
We'll just put somewhere.

1232
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,840
And...

1233
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,460
Complete.

1234
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,540
Good work!

1235
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,920
Remember, before you can place animals in any habitat, it has to have a full loop of connected barrier.

1236
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
Shouldn't we have windows so people can see inside?

1237
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,680
Now, we've probably noticed that guests can't actually see into this habitat at the moment.

1238
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,560
At least not without a stepladder.

1239
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,680
But seeing as they're banned, I'd like you to select a piece of barrier and swap out the brick for a glass barrier, so the guests can see in.

1240
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,700
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

1241
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:19,840
Oh, man.

1242
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,820
They can see here.

1243
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:25,700
Wait.

1244
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,960
Section...

1245
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,500
Highlight a section of barrier and then click the glass barrier.

1246
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,780
There we go.

1247
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,660
Adding in more windows gives guests even more opportunities to see the animals in a habitat.

1248
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,460
It looks kind of unsafe.

1249
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,020
It's always best to make sure the guests can get a good view into a habitat from the path they're walking on.

1250
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,460
Because it makes them happy.

1251
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,420
Oh, it goes behind.

1252
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,400
And because this would be a pretty terrible zoo if they couldn't.

1253
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,560
The last thing we need to do is to add a donation box.

1254
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,020
You see, when guests enjoy the view of an animal, they'll make a donation.

1255
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,540
Just make sure you put them in easy to reach places like near a viewing point.

1256
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,240
Oh, we're gonna put a lot of those.

1257
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,620
Donation boxes are one of the main sources of income for the zoo, so make sure you remember them.

1258
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,200
Okay.

1259
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,720
Now, before we adopt our ostriches, you should click the play button.

1260
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:20,340
After all, if the games pause, then so are our caretakers, which will make it a bit tricky for them to deliver the ostriches.

1261
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,420
Donation box, everybody donate!

1262
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,680
Outside placement area.

1263
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,780
No, I'm pretty sure...

1264
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,640
I'm pretty sure we're in the placement area.

1265
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:30,980
Okay.

1266
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,540
The game is really gatekeeping me right now.

1267
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,860
Okay.

1268
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,360
Um...

1269
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:38,840
Okay.

1270
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,040
Unpause time.

1271
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,120
By the way, as well as pausing the game, you can speed the game up by clicking on the fast forward button.

1272
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,020
It's just like the Sims.

1273
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,100
It'll run everything at two times and five times faster.

1274
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,680
It can be useful, especially if you're waiting for money to accumulate or for animals to be delivered to your habitat.

1275
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,360
Don't know for viewing, Minky.

1276
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,860
I'm Minky!

1277
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,100
And I'm in the glass cage!

1278
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,920
Alright, you've finished the habitat, so it's high time we adopted those ostriches, don't you think?

1279
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:04,380
Yes.

1280
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,920
Let's get four of them in here.

1281
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:06,500
Four?

1282
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,080
Uh...

1283
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,140
Where are they at?

1284
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,120
Where do I buy the...

1285
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,400
Here?

1286
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,000
What if I get a cheetah?

1287
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,400
Wait, this is...

1288
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,780
Oh, it's a Brazilian spider.

1289
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,320
I was gonna say, this is the spider that was on the camera today.

1290
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,680
I think they would like to have a little...

1291
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,840
Little friend in here as well.

1292
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,000
With them.

1293
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,600
We'll give...

1294
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,160
Okay, nobody will notice the snail, you know?

1295
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,280
Wait, actually, how do I buy again?

1296
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,760
I don't...

1297
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,460
Oh, animal trading.

1298
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:41,900
Here we go.

1299
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh, come on.

1300
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,480
No, no.

1301
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,800
Snail.

1302
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,700
Snail.

1303
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,980
No, snail!

1304
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:55,860
Minetal.

1305
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,400
It's my donation for the Great Mint Phantom Zoo.

1306
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,000
Thank you.

1307
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,420
If they like the Warthog exhibit, five star would recommend visiting again.

1308
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,420
Thank you.

1309
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,180
Alright.

1310
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,400
Wait.

1311
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,320
Send the zoo.

1312
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Wait a second.

1313
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,440
Source comments.

1314
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:22,860
Oh!

1315
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,340
Oh!

1316
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:23,720
Oh!

1317
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,260
I was like...

1318
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,740
Oh no!

1319
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,900
I think our guy is sick!

1320
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,840
He gets seizures!

1321
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:28,960
Nah.

1322
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,240
Send to zoo.

1323
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,860
One of our guys is a fancy fellow.

1324
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,920
Him.

1325
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,220
While we wait for them to be collected by the caretakers and brought to the habitat, you should get ready for them.

1326
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,440
Take the following.

1327
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,480
Big cat cafe.

1328
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,420
Add a suitable feeding station, water station, and an appropriate food enrichment item.

1329
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,320
Okay.

1330
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:57,900
It's often best to place things like enrichments and feeding stations near to the habitat perimeter, so guests can get a really good view of the animals.

1331
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,420
Yeah, I thought about that earlier.

1332
00:53:59,580 --> 00:53:59,660
Oh!

1333
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh!

1334
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,440
Where are they coming from?

1335
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,820
Stop throwing around my animals like this.

1336
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,140
What's your name?

1337
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,780
Normal.

1338
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:13,760
Delivered.

1339
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,340
Enjoy your new home, little body.

1340
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,660
Oh, here he comes.

1341
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,040
Oh, here they come.

1342
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,500
The marathon.

1343
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,500
Okay.

1344
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,480
I need to put in habitat.

1345
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,880
A slow feeder.

1346
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,800
I don't think they'll like that, but you know.

1347
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,080
And then...

1348
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:32,940
Nature.

1349
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,380
What else do they want?

1350
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,260
Water station, feeding station.

1351
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,500
Oh, here we go.

1352
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,800
And...

1353
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,620
Water.

1354
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:51,860
Perfect!

1355
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,240
Oh!

1356
00:54:56,070 --> 00:55:00,040
Will there be an exhibition for wisps and dragoons?

1357
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,440
Maybe.

1358
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:05,480
Dang!

1359
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,320
Our zoo is...

1360
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,900
Wow!

1361
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,600
Okay, I feel like I'm done.

1362
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,040
I'm impressed.

1363
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,380
Did you do a speed camera joke?

1364
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,880
Every time we get an ostrich.

1365
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,500
Enough of the tutorial.

1366
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,200
You know?

1367
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,180
So, now we've made the ostrich's lives a bit better.

1368
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,560
Let's do the same for the keepers, shall we?

1369
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,320
To make it easier for the keepers to feed the ostriches and hippos...

1370
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,720
Oh, they're also part of the zoo.

1371
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,440
We should build a new keeper hut.

1372
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,340
Keeper huts are where the keepers prepare the food for animals.

1373
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,740
So they should be placed near to the habitats.

1374
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,100
To make sure the keepers don't waste their time walking when they should be looking after the animals.

1375
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,200
Oh, wow.

1376
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:48,820
Okay.

1377
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,140
Facilities.

1378
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,680
Small hut.

1379
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,840
We'll go with this.

1380
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,000
It matches the...

1381
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,440
Oh, no.

1382
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:58,980
That's not that.

1383
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,780
You'll need to rotate the keeper hut to get it to connect up to the path.

1384
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,400
Oh.

1385
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,700
Okay.

1386
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,580
Rotate.

1387
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,200
Wow.

1388
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:09,940
So fancy.

1389
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:10,500
Okay.

1390
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,980
Good.

1391
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,820
This keeper hut only has space for one keeper.

1392
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,640
There were no servos unless they added in the DLC.

1393
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:19,900
Yeah.

1394
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,700
But the larger keeper hut can allow multiple keepers to prepare food at the same time.

1395
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:31,840
Oh, but bear in mind that keeper huts and other staff facilities shouldn't be placed near to areas where there are lots of guests.

1396
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,700
Guests don't like seeing facility buildings and it can affect their happiness.

1397
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:36,940
Oh.

1398
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,600
Negatively.

1399
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,960
In case that wasn't clear.

1400
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:42,900
Okay.

1401
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:43,400
What?

1402
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,400
What?

1403
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,720
What?

1404
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,560
Why don't they like seeing buildings?

1405
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,340
Bottom left.

1406
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,980
Lovely work.

1407
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,420
Now the keepers can start using the hut to prepare food.

1408
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,720
My immersion.

1409
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,120
And thanks to where you've put it, they wouldn't need to walk very far to deliver it to the ostriches and hippos.

1410
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,560
I think the animals in cages breaks my immersion.

1411
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,100
Bengal tigers.

1412
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,760
We want to adopt some, but I'm afraid there's nothing ready for them yet.

1413
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,840
She does have a bit of a threatening undertone, doesn't she?

1414
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,800
Head on over to the plot of land I've marked out.

1415
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,780
It's not too far away.

1416
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,140
Oh, I think we need to get rid of this.

1417
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:39,680
Okay, there we go.

1418
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:40,960
Here?

1419
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,040
Oh, we're actually like...

1420
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,460
Righty.

1421
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,160
Your next job is to build a habitat from scratch.

1422
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,680
And concrete and glass I expect.

1423
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,320
So, go ahead and build it.

1424
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,780
Just make sure that the habitat includes that big hole we've dug.

1425
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,260
Oh.

1426
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,280
And don't forget to add a habitat gate to the barrier.

1427
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,660
Okay.

1428
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,400
Oh, and make sure the guests will be able to see the tigers.

1429
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:04,720
Oh my gosh.

1430
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,620
Nancy.

1431
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,780
I got this girl.

1432
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,480
Nancy.

1433
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:08,640
Let's see.

1434
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,900
Full glass.

1435
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,660
All glass.

1436
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,880
Oh, it's the best habitat you've ever seen.

1437
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,360
You'll see it from every angle.

1438
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,700
Oh, oh.

1439
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,600
So close.

1440
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,120
So close.

1441
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,260
Come on.

1442
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,080
How am I supposed to make these connect?

1443
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,540
Oh wait.

1444
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,220
Uh, shoot.

1445
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,500
Hold on.

1446
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,480
Um...

1447
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,780
How do they connect?

1448
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,440
No privacy?

1449
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,280
They don't...

1450
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,520
They don't find their tigers.

1451
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:50,900
Okay.

1452
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,640
And then we need a gate.

1453
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,020
Oh, where...

1454
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,460
Oh, oh.

1455
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:58,760
Wait.

1456
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,400
What is this?

1457
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,720
A transformer.

1458
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,300
Okay.

1459
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,500
Um...

1460
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,260
We'll have it here.

1461
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,480
For the...

1462
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,260
Um...

1463
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,560
For the zookeepers.

1464
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,260
And I guess we gotta build a path.

1465
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,000
Otherwise they're gonna get really...

1466
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,300
Really...

1467
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:15,740
Upset.

1468
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,120
They're like little babies.

1469
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,380
They need to be...

1470
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,940
Handheld.

1471
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,040
Where'd it go?

1472
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:20,820
Now...

1473
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,780
Burnie takes safety very seriously at his zoos.

1474
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,620
So we should probably make sure those tigers can't jump out of their habitat.

1475
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,300
Don't you think?

1476
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,300
They won't.

1477
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,420
The way we'll do it...

1478
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,860
Is by changing the height of the habitat's barrier.

1479
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:33,520
Oh.

1480
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,300
Okay then.

1481
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,220
You should start by double clicking the habitat barrier.

1482
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,700
Which will take you into barrier editing mode.

1483
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,300
Great.

1484
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,140
Now highlight the entire perimeter of the habitat.

1485
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,060
How do I do that?

1486
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,720
By clicking and dragging the barrier selection tool.

1487
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Barrier selection tool.

1488
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,900
Barrier selection tool.

1489
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,840
Uh...

1490
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,320
Uh...

1491
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,280
Barrier selection tool.

1492
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,710
The arrows?

1493
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,950
Ah.

1494
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,930
Now you've got all of the perimeter selected.

1495
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:21,990
You can increase the height of it by clicking and dragging the barrier height tool upwards.

1496
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,170
There we go.

1497
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,450
You want to make sure it reaches a height of at least 3.7 meters.

1498
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,210
I'll do you better.

1499
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,930
I'll triple that number and give it to the next person.

1500
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,330
Please don't forget to put down a donation box.

1501
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,930
Oh yeah.

1502
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,230
We need every dollar we can get.

1503
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,410
She big about that money.

1504
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,990
Especially as these tigers aren't exactly eating instant noodles for lunch.

1505
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,510
Okay.

1506
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,510
That's the habitat boundary complete.

1507
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,090
The habitat gate in place.

1508
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:52,410
And most importantly, the tigers won't be able to jump out of it anymore.

1509
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,130
I think it's time we adopted those tigers.

1510
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,410
Oh my goodness.

1511
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:03,930
Can I see?

1512
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,950
I don't think people will be able to go over there.

1513
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,130
Can they go here?

1514
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:12,930
Yeah.

1515
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:16,690
Okay.

1516
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,210
Well, what were we doing?

1517
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,730
Oh, getting our tigers.

1518
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:21,990
Alright.

1519
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:24,610
Animals.

1520
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,750
Wow, they're expensive.

1521
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,430
Can we have a coyote, a dire wolf, and a humble penguin?

1522
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,350
I don't think I bought those DLCs.

1523
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,750
Okay, for habitat.

1524
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,750
Food tray large.

1525
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:02,330
This time, instead of adding a water bowl, let's try something different.

1526
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,950
Ooh.

1527
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:08,330
Some animals need a pool in their habitat so they can go for a swim, but they can also use it to drink from.

1528
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:15,350
All you have to do is make sure the banks of the pool have a gentle slope so they can easily get a nice refreshing drink.

1529
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,750
Okay.

1530
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:19,130
There's already a pool excavated, but you still need to fill it with water.

1531
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,470
You should do that by going into terrain and selecting the water tool.

1532
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:24,450
Water.

1533
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,990
Yes, that'll do nicely.

1534
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,110
That's it?

1535
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,570
Of course, just like the warthogs and ostriches...

1536
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,770
They have nothing there.

1537
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,910
It's gonna dry up in the sun.

1538
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:38,550
They have some suitable toy and food enrichment items into their habitat.

1539
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:40,250
Wait, wait.

1540
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,130
Oh, there we go.

1541
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,650
Wait, what just happened?

1542
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,480
Okay.

1543
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,800
I think we're fine.

1544
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,360
I think we're okay.

1545
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,010
Food enrichment.

1546
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,940
Place a toy.

1547
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,740
Frozen blood pumpkin.

1548
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,800
What is it obstructed by?

1549
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,560
Oh, here.

1550
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,100
There we go.

1551
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,960
The controls are a little...

1552
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,120
I gotta get used to it, but...

1553
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,400
And a rubbing pad.

1554
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,920
There's nothing in here, Nancy.

1555
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,660
Now, the tigers will need a shelter in their habitat, so they can hide from the guests.

1556
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,840
Or, more likely, the bad weather.

1557
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,360
Ah, more likely the guests.

1558
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,260
You might want to think of that just as normal weather.

1559
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,760
Go on, add a shelter to their habitat.

1560
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,520
This is huge!

1561
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:42,660
You can need to build one from various suitable bits and bobs, or if you like, just pop down the blueprint that I've already built for you.

1562
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:43,500
Oh my god.

1563
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,580
Oh, it's humongous.

1564
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,320
I'm gonna block these people's view.

1565
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,400
Oh, poor dabs.

1566
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,120
Poor guy.

1567
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,540
I'm sure it can't have escaped your attention that the tigers look a bit miffed.

1568
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,080
Why?

1569
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,740
That's because they aren't too keen on the type of terrain in their habitat.

1570
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,660
Yeah, because you said everything was fine, Nancy, when it wasn't.

1571
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,080
Goodness gracious.

1572
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,180
Even I knew that the- Right here.

1573
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,060
That way you can view the terrain information and see how they feel about the different types of terrain.

1574
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,820
That'll tell you what the tigers need more of or less of in this habitat.

1575
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,180
They need more long grass.

1576
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,960
Okay then, open the terrain editing tool, select painting, and give them some more soil.

1577
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,900
Yes, that should help with the habitat part of their welfare.

1578
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,060
Did that work?

1579
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,380
Oh, here we go.

1580
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,020
Okay, it's going up, it's going up.

1581
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,060
What do you think of...

1582
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,680
Boca Juniors?

1583
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,780
Of who?

1584
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,580
What's that?

1585
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,980
Oh wait, we have too much...

1586
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,780
Grass.

1587
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,700
Okay, we need more...

1588
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,080
Soil.

1589
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,260
Uh...

1590
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,500
Is this the correct soil?

1591
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,560
Okay, it's...

1592
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:14,720
It's...

1593
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,580
It's going down.

1594
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,600
This is what they like.

1595
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,540
Not enough short grass.

1596
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,320
Oh my gosh, these guys are so picky.

1597
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,080
Yeah!

1598
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,620
Looks like a baseball field.

1599
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,140
I should have made it.

1600
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,940
Kittens in the outfield.

1601
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,520
These tigers need a few more plants in their habitat.

1602
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,020
To get a perfect fit, use plants from the rainforest and temperate biomes that are native to Asia.

1603
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,000
Although if you have to, you can get away with using just one or the other.

1604
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:55,220
The tigers will also want a certain amount of their habitat to be covered by those plants.

1605
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:01,400
To find out which plants to use and how many, select a tiger and go to the environment tab.

1606
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:01,760
Okay.

1607
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,300
I kind of miss how...

1608
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,900
As you can see, some of the plants currently in the habitat aren't quite right for the tiger.

1609
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,180
Please!

1610
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,360
Like the wattle bushes.

1611
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,680
You can remove them if you want.

1612
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,860
I kind of miss how...

1613
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,300
You can find all of the plants you need in the nature section.

1614
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,140
And you can use the filters to only show the types of plants you want to see.

1615
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,160
In this case, that's plants from the rainforest or temperate biomes.

1616
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,400
I kind of miss how in...

1617
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,220
How in Zoo Tycoon...

1618
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,680
They'll be like...

1619
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,100
Wee!

1620
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,400
Wee!

1621
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,780
When they're...

1622
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,960
When they're sad.

1623
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,540
This is Nancy's stream.

1624
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,580
Please don't talk, weep duck.

1625
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,180
Whatever.

1626
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,660
Do they like an elephant ear?

1627
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,180
They have no opinion.

1628
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,140
Wait, what do you like?

1629
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,420
Okay, we need more coverage.

1630
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,840
Where did I see...

1631
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,620
Oh, here, here, here.

1632
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:08,920
Okay.

1633
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
Plants and habitat.

1634
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,520
Oh, some...

1635
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,020
Okay, so some of them aren't great.

1636
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,060
Like the spruce tree, they hate it.

1637
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,100
Let's do some ferns.

1638
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,380
Oh!

1639
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,420
Oh wow, that was so easy.

1640
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,540
They say that good fences make good neighbors.

1641
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,880
I guess that's doubly true when one of the neighbors is a Bengal tiger.

1642
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,760
Still, those tigers look so happy that I doubt they'd leave.

1643
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,920
Even if you did poke a hole in their fence.

1644
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,220
Okay.

1645
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:47,580
Oh.

1646
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,460
But for heaven's sake, don't test that theory.

1647
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,520
Thanks, Bernie.

1648
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,000
I think I'm gonna stop...

1649
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,460
Oh, no.

1650
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,500
Shut up, Nancy.

1651
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,360
Nancy, shut up.

1652
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,220
Nancy.

1653
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,760
Nancy, I wanna go back home.

1654
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,520
Exit to main menu.

1655
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,180
I think we're good with the tutorial.

1656
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,820
No more Nancy.

1657
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:03,920
Nancy.

1658
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,760
I don't...

1659
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,040
I can't deal with her anymore.

1660
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,040
I can't...

1661
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,080
Okay, I think we're now good.

1662
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:14,980
Whoa.

1663
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,720
Who was that?

1664
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,060
Wait.

1665
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,900
The people were replaced by animals.

1666
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,520
What?

1667
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,180
Oh.

1668
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,620
This is me.

1669
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,280
This is...

1670
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,440
Wait, this is a career scenario.

1671
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,420
I thought it was the one that I was doing earlier.

1672
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,360
Bye, Nancy.

1673
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:43,540
See?

1674
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,320
Huh.

1675
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:51,240
How long do you think it'll be before she unleashes tigers and the zoo visitors?

1676
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,110
I don't wanna do a career, though.

1677
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,550
I wanna do my own thing, you know?

1678
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,390
So we will go away from...

1679
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,570
My zoo.

1680
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:07,010
Oh, these are the good ones.

1681
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:07,990
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1682
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,610
No, no, no, no, no.

1683
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,270
Back, back, back.

1684
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:12,250
Sandbox.

1685
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,810
And we're gonna do a scenario.

1686
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:17,530
And we're gonna do the castle myers.

1687
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,070
And we're...

1688
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,030
Clear all zoo of scenario items.

1689
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,070
I wonder what it'll look like then.

1690
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,520
The spooky zoo.

1691
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,380
I don't remember why I named it before.

1692
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,200
Nancy is set to free room.

1693
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,640
She just...

1694
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:46,840
Talks and talks.

1695
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,580
I'd throw her into the lava.

1696
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,080
I wonder what terrain only...

1697
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,420
I don't wanna get rid of some of the spooky things, but...

1698
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,640
I guess we'll just buy them back, huh?

1699
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,060
What if I create a zoo of one really cool animal?

1700
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,460
I think people would wanna come and see it.

1701
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,340
Nancy.

1702
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,940
Let's do it.

1703
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,120
What animal?

1704
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,480
I don't know.

1705
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,480
We'll have to see what we got.

1706
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,060
I'm excited to see the terrain now.

1707
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:32,940
Oh!

1708
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,340
There's a whole lot of nothing.

1709
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,550
Oh, wow.

1710
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:51,530
Oh!

1711
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,270
How much money do we have?

1712
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,630
Um...

1713
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,910
Unlimited?

1714
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,270
No way!

1715
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,050
We have unlimited money?

1716
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,030
Wait, but that's not really how you play the game.

1717
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,280
I want a...

1718
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,300
Bit of a budget.

1719
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,480
Spend!

1720
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,020
Spend!

1721
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:16,720
Spend!

1722
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,320
Let's see what animals we got.

1723
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:18,900
Wait, zoo.

1724
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:21,580
Animals.

1725
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:22,420
Okay, here we go.

1726
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,180
None.

1727
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,480
Why wouldn't it let me go to...

1728
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,360
Oh, maybe I have to make a barrier first before we go into the animal...

1729
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,360
Trading.

1730
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,220
Sandbox mode is unlimited.

1731
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:34,880
What?

1732
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,060
What?

1733
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,260
Uh...

1734
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,560
Okay, hold on then.

1735
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,040
Ambient speaker...

1736
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,400
Okay.

1737
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,240
What's our spooky stuff here?

1738
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,580
Oh my gosh, can I...

1739
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,180
Can I hide all the things that require DLC?

1740
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,340
Okay, here we go.

1741
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,060
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

1742
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,580
Gopi slush.

1743
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,880
What is that?

1744
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,440
Oh my god!

1745
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,440
The person just came out from there!

1746
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,940
Oh, and he's gone.

1747
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:12,900
He quit.

1748
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,020
First day on the job, he couldn't handle it.

1749
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,200
Oh, we'll do a second guy.

1750
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,180
Right next to him.

1751
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,220
It's kind of majestic with this music and watching them just disappear.

1752
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:29,380
Here?

1753
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:37,950
I'm trying to get my, uh...

1754
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,110
Oh.

1755
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:41,090
Street fox fox...

1756
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,750
Coffee...

1757
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:43,690
Counter.

1758
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,610
Trying to get my spooky things.

1759
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,750
Twilight...

1760
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,430
See, see, see, see, see, see.

1761
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,170
Like this, like this.

1762
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:48,370
Okay.

1763
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,300
Can I get rid of this place?

1764
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:56,740
Delete.

1765
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:03,830
Or they have to just...

1766
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:05,070
They'll go through a second entrance.

1767
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,490
It's all good.

1768
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:07,890
They can do it.

1769
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,700
One entrance into the next entrance.

1770
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,820
Wait, how do I...

1771
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:19,940
What?

1772
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,780
How do you...

1773
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:24,140
Where is it?

1774
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:24,720
Eh?

1775
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,940
You walk in, but where do you walk out?

1776
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,820
Huh?

1777
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,920
Oh wait, right here.

1778
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,660
Huh.

1779
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,080
Is it working?

1780
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,140
Oh, no.

1781
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,760
He's trying.

1782
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,480
You can do it.

1783
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,440
I feel like I'm watching like a...

1784
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,300
Guy trying to harness his superpowers for the first time ever.

1785
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,100
What is this place then?

1786
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,580
Oops.

1787
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,540
There we go.

1788
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,720
Then you go through...

1789
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,780
And it leads you...

1790
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,780
To...

1791
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:36,620
What?

1792
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,720
Why are there no exits?

1793
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,060
It says zoo entrance.

1794
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,900
Build something.

1795
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,580
Okay.

1796
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,460
Let's build.

1797
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,980
We'll do...

1798
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,600
We'll do...

1799
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,140
I don't know...

1800
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,060
Chain link.

1801
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,540
Circle.

1802
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,570
There we go.

1803
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,490
Okay.

1804
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:25,610
Gate.

1805
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:27,570
Alright.

1806
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:30,570
And...

1807
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,670
Do we need the facility?

1808
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,810
There's so many things.

1809
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,070
Going to the zoo.

1810
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:44,230
Watching animals in their red shirts try to solve problems.

1811
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,670
It's like a...

1812
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,890
Actually looks like a heart.

1813
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,470
That's even sweeter, huh?

1814
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:50,450
Hehehe.

1815
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,550
I love my animals.

1816
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:57,250
And I love my money.

1817
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:03,650
Yes, yes, yes.

1818
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:05,590
Yes, yes, yes.

1819
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,330
I like the way you build the paths in this.

1820
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:15,770
It's...

1821
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,670
Really satisfying.

1822
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,760
Can I...

1823
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,280
Stop it now?

1824
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:22,740
There we go.

1825
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,220
Okay.

1826
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,020
Facilities.

1827
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,260
They also wanted educational things, I remember.

1828
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,830
They want to know about whatever creature will be in here.

1829
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,910
Which will be...

1830
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:42,930
In here.

1831
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,350
Soon.

1832
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,270
Look!

1833
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,890
It's so close that even...

1834
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:49,310
The animal could donate if they wanted to.

1835
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,710
Wait, why can't I go to the animal trading yet?

1836
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,710
What am I doing wrong?

1837
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,780
What's this?

1838
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,380
Guest spawner.

1839
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:12,780
Oh.

1840
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,180
That's interesting.

1841
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,440
Oh, I need to build the...

1842
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,660
Hold on.

1843
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,820
Let's do staff facilities.

1844
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,700
The place where the...

1845
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,700
They spawn, right?

1846
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,200
Whoa.

1847
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,620
Oh, this is huge.

1848
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,020
It's...

1849
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,120
It's called the staff room small.

1850
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,160
Oh, the trade center.

1851
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:41,960
Here we go, here we go.

1852
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,410
We'll build it like right here.

1853
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,350
Hopefully, people like it.

1854
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,110
Terrain modification.

1855
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,630
There we go, there we go, there we go.

1856
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,230
There we go.

1857
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,830
Oh my gosh.

1858
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,130
What can we get?

1859
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:02,790
What can we get?

1860
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:03,850
What can we get?

1861
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,670
The giant tortoise.

1862
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,390
Build a stage and teach the animals to sing and dance.

1863
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,930
Just like the movie.

1864
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:15,870
Sing.

1865
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,310
A tape here.

1866
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,130
That's all I can get?

1867
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:23,950
Oh, no.

1868
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,310
Just kidding.

1869
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:24,630
Next.

1870
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:28,310
Still need a staff room.

1871
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,730
Okay.

1872
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:29,610
Thank you.

1873
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:33,670
Bonobo.

1874
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:38,350
See that.

1875
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:40,670
Hmm.

1876
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:44,810
Ostrich.

1877
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:46,670
We gotta get a creepy critter.

1878
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,410
Something...

1879
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:50,370
Freaky.

1880
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,470
Like that.

1881
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,210
These look...

1882
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,630
Some of these look really realistic.

1883
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:00,130
Like the flamingo looks really realistic.

1884
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,430
Like the flamingo looks really realistic.

1885
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,530
Spider pit.

1886
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:04,970
Yeah.

1887
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,430
Peacock.

1888
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:08,870
Oh.

1889
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,350
Komodo dragon.

1890
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,050
I think...

1891
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,550
A monitor.

1892
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:18,770
What if I just make a...

1893
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:19,710
A lizard pit.

1894
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,500
Raccoon.

1895
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,720
That must be the DLC.

1896
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,780
Was that a lemur?

1897
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,040
Was that a lemur?

1898
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:30,120
Yeah.

1899
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,380
More lemur.

1900
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,000
How many pages are there?

1901
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,140
Snow leopard.

1902
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,480
A skunk.

1903
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,800
Ah.

1904
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:46,940
We don't have dire wolf.

1905
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,120
But we have timber wolf.

1906
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:51,760
Okay.

1907
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,540
Let's get the...

1908
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,840
Let's get the...

1909
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,340
Wait.

1910
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,080
Where is he?

1911
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,380
Here we go.

1912
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,600
Komodo dragon.

1913
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,280
This guy's got a medal.

1914
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,020
Of honor.

1915
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:08,420
Okay.

1916
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,700
We'll hold on to him for now.

1917
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,980
He's waiting in the trade center.

1918
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,040
Okay.

1919
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:17,740
Nice.

1920
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,320
Nice, nice, nice.

1921
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,300
We got the two...

1922
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,800
Most prized...

1923
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,860
Sought after...

1924
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,280
Dragons.

1925
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,080
The Covenant Lizard Award.

1926
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:32,540
Lizard.

1927
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,340
Okay, we gotta build a staff room.

1928
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,500
Ooh, it's getting dark.

1929
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,240
This area...

1930
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,840
Is beautiful!

1931
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,140
Wow.

1932
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:48,580
My gosh.

1933
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,140
How do people get up here?

1934
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,360
Wait a second.

1935
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,650
I just noticed...

1936
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,710
This is where the castle was.

1937
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,210
Uh-oh.

1938
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,010
Wait, I think I made a mistake.

1939
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,200
This is where the zoo was below...

1940
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:12,820
Before.

1941
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,140
And then...

1942
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,560
The castle was up here.

1943
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,500
Oh.

1944
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,700
Let's see what castle we have.

1945
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,090
Veterinary surgery.

1946
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,730
Oh, wait.

1947
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,570
Oh, let's do all.

1948
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:36,830
Oh, we are on all.

1949
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:41,660
Oh.

1950
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:43,500
Oh.

1951
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,600
Guess facility?

1952
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,080
Maybe.

1953
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,580
Oh, no.

1954
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:51,100
It's the entrance.

1955
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,660
Getting ahead of myself.

1956
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,220
The toilet large.

1957
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,720
They probably need that.

1958
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,620
This is a large toilet for real.

1959
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:07,010
You two can pee right in front of the Komodo dragon.

1960
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:11,230
Not as beautiful as the ghost in the right corner.

1961
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,210
Staff.

1962
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:19,350
This is a true landmark of the park.

1963
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,330
It's ginormous.

1964
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,150
I want to add some like...

1965
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,610
Some of our old trees and all.

1966
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:29,190
Some of our own freaky things and the...

1967
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:29,990
How do I...

1968
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,270
Oh, DLC.

1969
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,590
Wait.

1970
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,570
How do I know what I purchased for the DLC?

1971
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:37,390
Who's here?

1972
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:38,050
Oh, Staff.

1973
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:38,210
Staff.

1974
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:40,650
Oh, I need staff.

1975
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:41,770
Okay.

1976
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,450
I'll get by some staff.

1977
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,490
I'll buy...

1978
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:47,950
How do I buy staff?

1979
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,870
I skipped that part of the tutorial.

1980
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:54,810
Oh, here we go.

1981
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,000
You...

1982
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,260
And...

1983
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:04,920
You...

1984
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,920
Security.

1985
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,240
Buy some staff.

1986
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,760
Maybe you should have listened to Nancy.

1987
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:18,500
Nah.

1988
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:20,660
Nah.

1989
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,220
Oh, my bad.

1990
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:22,840
Here we go.

1991
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,360
We have Abraham.

1992
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,500
He's supposed to be at Gopi's soda counter one, but he's...

1993
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,760
Actually...

1994
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:30,900
Like...

1995
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,880
Neglecting his job entirely.

1996
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,660
I can't see...

1997
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:34,940
Anything.

1998
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:37,660
Facilities.

1999
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,360
Lights.

2000
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:38,960
Please.

2001
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:42,980
Power.

2002
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,040
Oh, wait.

2003
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,760
Oh, whoa.

2004
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,040
We need the transformer, don't we?

2005
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,400
Or something?

2006
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,040
I don't quite understand it.

2007
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,660
And I know we're not supposed to put the staff room right next to...

2008
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,640
Right next to the exhibit, but...

2009
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,000
It's just gonna have to be the way that...

2010
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,620
That is.

2011
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,290
Maybe we can cover it with foliage.

2012
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,450
Nobody will see a thing.

2013
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:19,790
With...

2014
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,890
The festive spruce...

2015
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:23,190
Oh, it's so small.

2016
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,210
Uh...

2017
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:26,150
Oh, oh.

2018
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:26,830
Like this.

2019
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,360
It's like when they make those...

2020
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,240
Um...

2021
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:36,960
Those...

2022
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,480
Uh...

2023
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,780
Towers, but they are...

2024
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:41,820
They look like trees.

2025
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,200
Now the guests will never see the...

2026
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,380
Um...

2027
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,400
The...

2028
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,350
The staff housing.

2029
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,770
Staffing quarters.

2030
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:10,620
There we go.

2031
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,300
Oh, please.

2032
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,340
Oh, please.

2033
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,560
Nancy more like...

2034
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,360
Nancy.

2035
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,760
She ain't listening.

2036
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:18,320
Please.

2037
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,880
How do I open the mega door?

2038
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,160
I'm so confused about this actually.

2039
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,360
I'm actually so confused.

2040
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,680
Do I need to make the gate here too?

2041
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:38,680
No.

2042
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:38,760
No.

2043
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,920
They spawn from inside the entrance.

2044
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,620
Do they?

2045
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:52,760
Okay.

2046
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,120
Well, let's get our...

2047
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,120
Our...

2048
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,100
Iguanas.

2049
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,500
And we'll put them in our...

2050
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,020
The cage.

2051
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,500
This guy costs 58 leaves.

2052
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,340
Nobody wants them.

2053
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,360
Animal storage.

2054
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,000
Okay, here we go.

2055
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,120
Send the zoo.

2056
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:13,880
Send the zoo.

2057
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:16,460
And I'm gonna make this cage look amazing and great.

2058
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,980
Not like those...

2059
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,480
Poopy other ones.

2060
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,160
Did I say iguana?

2061
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,060
I meant...

2062
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:27,740
Komodo dragon.

2063
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:40,680
Oh yeah.

2064
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,540
Ra...

2065
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,020
Rara.

2066
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,720
Alright, what do you want Rara?

2067
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,900
You want...

2068
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,160
More...

2069
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,000
Long grass.

2070
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:52,600
Got it.

2071
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,210
Uh...

2072
01:26:59,210 --> 01:26:59,870
Am I doing it?

2073
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,420
Uh...

2074
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,340
Am I doing it?

2075
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:15,650
Uh...

2076
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,410
Why isn't it going down?

2077
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,010
Rock?

2078
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,920
We should build...

2079
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,980
We should write it in a funny language.

2080
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:32,640
Or something.

2081
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:33,760
Hold on.

2082
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,740
Control Z.

2083
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,240
There we go.

2084
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,480
Wish I could see anything.

2085
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,520
Um...

2086
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,860
Draw a wisp.

2087
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:55,600
Looks like an apple.

2088
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,160
Okay, more rock.

2089
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,530
More rock.

2090
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:16,830
More rock.

2091
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:20,670
Okay.

2092
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:21,870
Almost.

2093
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:22,910
Okay, sand.

2094
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,890
You think they like sand course?

2095
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:28,790
Might be easier for their little toes.

2096
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,210
I hear people laughing.

2097
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,630
We have customers!

2098
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:35,770
I repeat.

2099
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,510
We have customers.

2100
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,670
This is not a drill.

2101
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,330
Everyone's gonna be so excited.

2102
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,010
Okay.

2103
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,270
Now we just need more grass long.

2104
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,740
Very carefully.

2105
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,200
Oh, too much grass long.

2106
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,020
We can replace it with some sand.

2107
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,940
It's less grass long.

2108
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:24,460
Oh.

2109
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,140
Not bad.

2110
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,280
Wait, was it from the beginning?

2111
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:28,840
Less...

2112
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,660
Less grass?

2113
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:31,500
Oopsie!

2114
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,000
We'll do short grass.

2115
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,540
We can do more of that.

2116
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,540
Not enough rock!

2117
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,140
Less soil.

2118
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,280
Too much grass long.

2119
01:29:58,530 --> 01:29:58,970
Too much grass long.

2120
01:29:58,970 --> 01:29:58,990
Ugh.

2121
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,450
How is there still too much grass long?

2122
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,590
Wow, these guys are so picky.

2123
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,790
Guys, I...

2124
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:13,450
Just today I was like...

2125
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,250
Hmm, I'm kinda bored.

2126
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,830
What do I do?

2127
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:16,610
I tried playing Age of Empires.

2128
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,630
Um...

2129
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,590
Against some CPU.

2130
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:20,290
And I got my butt whooped.

2131
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,970
I think I'm bad at that game.

2132
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:27,350
Super chato for the iguana.

2133
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:29,890
Thank you!

2134
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:35,030
How is there still too much grass?

2135
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:35,870
Long!

2136
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,650
I've covered this entire place.

2137
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:41,150
There is no grass long anymore.

2138
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:42,410
Is there?

2139
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:46,430
There's literally no grass long in here anymore.

2140
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,300
Takes practice.

2141
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,040
Yeah.

2142
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:58,380
Clearly.

2143
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,500
Moderate AOE AI is brutal.

2144
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:04,640
Oh, I like...

2145
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:05,140
They were...

2146
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,180
They were attacking me like nothing else.

2147
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:14,000
They hate the sight of the grass long?

2148
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:14,780
Wait, seriously?

2149
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,080
Maybe it's because it's touching their...

2150
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,220
Their...

2151
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,160
Their thing.

2152
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,660
They just hate it so much.

2153
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:27,820
They're like...

2154
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,360
It can't even touch our...

2155
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:29,820
Exhibit.

2156
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,020
We don't want it...

2157
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,420
Any near...

2158
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,420
Anywhere near us.

2159
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,640
Uh...

2160
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:44,920
Look how cute.

2161
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:45,860
Oh my god.

2162
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,300
Wait, it's really cute!

2163
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,420
Oh wait, maybe some grass long over here?

2164
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,180
I have no idea.

2165
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:00,360
Wait, why is our fence so like...

2166
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,000
Um...

2167
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,420
Oh, there's just...

2168
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,340
There's just a hole.

2169
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,800
There's like a pet door for these guys.

2170
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,540
Oh wow, this is...

2171
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,240
Um...

2172
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,720
This one's fine.

2173
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,340
So is this one...

2174
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,340
They can't...

2175
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,180
They can't get out.

2176
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,720
They don't even care to.

2177
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,280
You don't care to leave, do you?

2178
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:28,740
Like...

2179
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:29,800
Oh, he's taking a nap.

2180
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,580
He's recharging his energy to...

2181
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,060
To...

2182
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,080
For his escape plan.

2183
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,340
This for real has many spikes.

2184
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:40,980
Lower settings.

2185
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,240
Wait for you to advance in age, for example.

2186
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:44,840
Oh, yeah.

2187
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,200
I was trying to...

2188
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,740
They like completely ambushed me.

2189
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,220
I was trying to like...

2190
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,520
Start an army.

2191
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,040
I built my castle.

2192
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,620
And then...

2193
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,240
They destroyed my castle twice.

2194
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,930
Where is the grass long?

2195
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,450
I'm actually confused now.

2196
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:15,780
Oh well.

2197
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:16,260
Okay.

2198
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,140
What else do you want?

2199
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,540
You want...

2200
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,140
You want...

2201
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,320
Uh...

2202
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,300
What kind of things?

2203
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,760
It doesn't say.

2204
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:27,220
Uh oh.

2205
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,740
It honestly feels like they have a vendetta sometimes.

2206
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,500
I know!

2207
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,740
And then I had an ally team too.

2208
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,480
And they did not help even once.

2209
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:44,510
Okay, wait.

2210
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:44,870
Okay.

2211
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,810
Let's uh...

2212
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:47,150
How do we know what they like?

2213
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:50,590
Filter by...

2214
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:52,410
Uh...

2215
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,070
Biome is tropical.

2216
01:33:55,190 --> 01:33:56,630
And grassland.

2217
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:58,510
Alright.

2218
01:33:59,250 --> 01:33:59,970
Maybe...

2219
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:00,690
This...

2220
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:01,430
This tree.

2221
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:04,690
Huh.

2222
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,930
Do they actually want more grass long?

2223
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:08,990
I don't think so.

2224
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:12,430
No.

2225
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:13,570
Oh.

2226
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:17,170
Yes.

2227
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,640
Yes.

2228
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,200
They need more grass long.

2229
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,500
Oops.

2230
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:43,700
More grass long.

2231
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,920
Almost there.

2232
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:54,920
Wait.

2233
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,540
Why does it feel like the bar is moving?

2234
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,600
Am I crazy?

2235
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,160
It did say less.

2236
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:03,700
Oh wait!

2237
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,800
Animal needs less grass long.

2238
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,720
I can't read.

2239
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:29,640
These guys are divas for real!

2240
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,840
Less grass long.

2241
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:37,520
Um.

2242
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,250
Less...

2243
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,560
There's like no other...

2244
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,780
I can't take away any more grass long from you guys.

2245
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:48,940
That's it.

2246
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:50,040
It's all gone.

2247
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,060
It's been mowed.

2248
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,440
It will never be...

2249
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,440
It will never grow again.

2250
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,760
Huh.

2251
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,380
It's so mysterious.

2252
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:04,820
Anyway.

2253
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:09,060
We need some more nature.

2254
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,880
Do you think they want a pond?

2255
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,040
We can do that.

2256
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,280
Construction.

2257
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,280
What?

2258
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:18,740
What the hell is this?

2259
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,580
Terrain.

2260
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,560
Sculpting.

2261
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,070
I discovered some grass long.

2262
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:37,590
Wait!

2263
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:38,870
Where did this come from?

2264
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,170
I'm sorry?

2265
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:44,470
How?

2266
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:49,070
Some of the grass short might be long in disguise.

2267
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,410
I can't believe we discovered the grass long!

2268
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:57,730
Wait.

2269
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:58,970
What do we need more of?

2270
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,130
Maybe some more sand.

2271
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,360
Remove all green.

2272
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,000
But they need some grass.

2273
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:15,620
Grass.

2274
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:27,640
Maybe there's like parts that are just so like minuscule grass long, you know?

2275
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:30,080
Let's do some more rock.

2276
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,800
Oh my gosh, it's going down for real.

2277
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,540
What's actually happening?

2278
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,220
These guys are divas.

2279
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,150
It worked!

2280
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,090
Important alert.

2281
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,610
Uh-oh.

2282
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:55,230
What's wrong?

2283
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:59,150
Can't find an accessible keeper hut with space.

2284
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:00,770
What are you talking about?

2285
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:02,710
Diseased?

2286
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:03,550
Wait.

2287
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,270
Uh-oh.

2288
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:05,770
Why are you diseased?

2289
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:06,530
Hold on.

2290
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:07,790
Uh...

2291
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,370
Uh...

2292
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:09,010
Uh...

2293
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:10,650
How do I hire people again?

2294
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,750
A zoo.

2295
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,110
Uh...

2296
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:14,190
Veterinarian.

2297
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:16,890
Take care of my pet.

2298
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:17,590
Oh, I can't...

2299
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:18,550
I can't put them in there.

2300
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:24,170
Go!

2301
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,450
Go!

2302
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:24,790
Go!

2303
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,210
They're running?

2304
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:26,870
Okay, good.

2305
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:27,230
They're running.

2306
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:29,630
No!

2307
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:30,910
He feels so bad!

2308
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:34,010
He has Campy Lobacteroseus!

2309
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:35,190
Oh my god!

2310
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,380
Oh my god.

2311
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:41,880
Oh my god.

2312
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:42,400
Oh my god.

2313
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,800
Park is closed, everybody.

2314
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,380
Go home!

2315
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,280
Okay, let's do some more nature.

2316
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,300
We'll make them happy.

2317
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,840
Do they want water?

2318
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,260
I guess it doesn't say.

2319
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,600
But I can put some water in the...

2320
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:01,020
Terrain.

2321
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:01,540
Here we go.

2322
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,620
This is snow water.

2323
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,180
Obstructed.

2324
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,220
By what?

2325
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:13,930
Secret tall grass.

2326
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,290
That's so scary.

2327
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:17,170
Where does it come from?

2328
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:19,510
Oh my god.

2329
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:22,010
I don't think I like that.

2330
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:26,970
Okay.

2331
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:27,850
Water.

2332
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:30,250
No, I saw it.

2333
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,210
Obstructed where?

2334
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:34,070
Please.

2335
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:35,510
Please.

2336
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:36,690
Please, my guys are thirsty.

2337
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:37,290
Oh, mate.

2338
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:38,830
They don't have any things...

2339
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:39,970
Any ways to eat, do they?

2340
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:41,010
Okay, hold on.

2341
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:43,830
How...

2342
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:44,990
What do they require?

2343
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,170
What do you require to eat?

2344
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:57,890
Oh, he's not hungry at all.

2345
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:00,170
Mate.

2346
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:02,170
Enrichment.

2347
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:07,490
Here we go.

2348
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:08,410
You want a...

2349
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,030
A pumpkin?

2350
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:11,070
Oh, yeah.

2351
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,930
Oh, yeah.

2352
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:13,450
You want some...

2353
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:15,790
Bedding with some large leaves?

2354
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:16,410
Hmm.

2355
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:18,050
It doesn't care about that.

2356
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:20,130
You want, uh...

2357
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,810
A blood scent marker?

2358
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,790
Oh, they like that.

2359
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,330
Here, put them by the guests.

2360
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,950
Put it by the guests.

2361
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:30,510
Oh, yeah.

2362
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:30,790
Oh, yeah.

2363
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,770
You smell all those...

2364
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,930
All that fresh, fresh meat, baby.

2365
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:38,010
Don't get too close, everyone.

2366
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:40,690
That hole isn't just for show.

2367
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,440
A large ball.

2368
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,720
Nice.

2369
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,420
Okay, they have lots of enrichment now.

2370
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:00,430
Um...

2371
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,230
Let's do...

2372
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:04,390
Large water bowl.

2373
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:07,910
Um...

2374
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:10,530
We'll do a place for their food, which can go...

2375
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:13,050
On the...

2376
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:15,570
On, uh...

2377
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:15,910
Here?

2378
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,590
Nope, that's water.

2379
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,630
Food tray...

2380
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:20,050
Large.

2381
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:24,830
Perfect.

2382
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:28,910
He he he.

2383
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:29,630
Ha ha ha.

2384
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:38,230
Why are there people at my zoo at like 2 in the morning?

2385
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,650
I think he misses his friend.

2386
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:45,550
He's restless.

2387
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,350
It's okay, he'll be okay.

2388
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,350
It's okay.

2389
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,150
He'll be okay.

2390
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,430
It's okay.

2391
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:57,390
Look at the way he moves.

2392
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,410
I wanna pet that guy.

2393
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,610
Komodo dragon.

2394
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,390
He's sniffing.

2395
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:02,850
He's sniffing.

2396
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:03,450
He's sniffing.

2397
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:04,970
Smell the blood.

2398
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,020
He smells the blood.

2399
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,100
Where is he going?

2400
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,360
His habitat sucks.

2401
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,360
He needs more...

2402
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,540
Oh, he needs hard shelter.

2403
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:22,880
Okay.

2404
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:24,860
Uh...

2405
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,040
Okay.

2406
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,000
More plants.

2407
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,240
I like this one.

2408
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:33,980
It's nice and big.

2409
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,700
Um, maybe...

2410
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:37,880
Whoa.

2411
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:39,380
This one's even bigger.

2412
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,400
Um...

2413
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:45,080
Whoa!

2414
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,160
Sorry.

2415
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,940
They just keep getting bigger.

2416
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,100
They just keep getting bigger.

2417
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,200
There you go, buddy.

2418
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:03,960
Facility has significant negative effects.

2419
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:04,820
What are you talking about?

2420
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,420
High amounts of litter.

2421
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:09,660
Oh my god!

2422
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,580
Is the janitor not doing his job?

2423
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,720
Okay, we need trash cans.

2424
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:16,460
What are you doing?

2425
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,560
Heading to habitat...

2426
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,140
What do you got?

2427
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:21,200
What are you running for?

2428
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,360
Why are we running?

2429
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:23,260
What do you have?

2430
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,640
What do you have in your hands?

2431
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:26,720
Bins.

2432
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,140
Okay.

2433
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,480
Oh, we need...

2434
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,320
Facilities.

2435
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:35,040
Oh, bins.

2436
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,920
We need a creepy bin.

2437
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:38,900
Spooky.

2438
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:40,280
Like this.

2439
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:41,620
The twilight bin.

2440
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,100
Hot dog.

2441
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,480
Hot dog.

2442
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:44,980
Yeah.

2443
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,040
You think people like my zoo?

2444
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,380
We can see what they think.

2445
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,580
How are you feeling about my zoo?

2446
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:53,720
Hunger.

2447
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:54,800
Thirsty.

2448
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,440
Well, there's...

2449
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,140
What are you doing?

2450
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,600
Waiting for a vet surgery.

2451
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,140
Oh!

2452
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:04,920
Oh!

2453
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,160
That's the staff!

2454
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:09,940
Oops.

2455
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:14,580
He's just been carrying around.

2456
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:16,400
Oh my god.

2457
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,980
That's so sad.

2458
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,200
Vet surgery.

2459
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:22,720
Vet surgery.

2460
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:24,360
Oh, here we go.

2461
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,170
I'll put it here.

2462
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,590
And then we'll build a path.

2463
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:39,090
How do I build it?

2464
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,920
Nobody can read that.

2465
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,100
Nobody read that.

2466
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,180
Nobody read that.

2467
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,260
We could still save him.

2468
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,380
Oh, there's a bathroom here.

2469
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,400
Oops.

2470
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,340
I thought it was on the other side.

2471
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,340
Where does this go to then?

2472
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:15,760
Oh.

2473
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,460
It does.

2474
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:16,800
Okay.

2475
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:28,700
Akbar.

2476
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:32,430
Oh.

2477
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,250
Wait, why did you die?

2478
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:37,050
I thought it was the guy in surgery.

2479
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,500
Oh, hold on.

2480
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,180
Pez, I think one's out.

2481
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,740
I take good care of my pets.

2482
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,460
Don't worry.

2483
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:50,740
Oh.

2484
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:51,900
Wait.

2485
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:51,920
What?

2486
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,940
We see him in the sunrise.

2487
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:58,820
Oh.

2488
01:45:59,120 --> 01:45:59,180
Oh.

2489
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:00,560
Oh.

2490
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:00,620
Oh.

2491
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:00,640
Yay.

2492
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:01,700
Oh no.

2493
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:10,110
Oh my god.

2494
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:11,730
He came back at his friend's...

2495
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:12,050
Don't.

2496
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:12,310
No.

2497
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:13,610
This is so...

2498
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:20,370
I think he was old.

2499
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,450
Wait, this guy's 17.

2500
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,040
So sad.

2501
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,900
Wait, what's a hard shelter?

2502
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,800
Shelter space is critically insufficient to cover all animals.

2503
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,760
What's a hard shelter?

2504
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:43,580
Look, he's licking the blood.

2505
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,300
I guess like a cave.

2506
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:51,220
Okay.

2507
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:51,960
Hold on, Pez.

2508
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,360
Come here.

2509
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:53,780
Come here.

2510
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:55,340
Come here.

2511
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,160
Come here.

2512
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:56,540
Come here.

2513
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,060
Come here.

2514
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:57,920
Come here.

2515
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:01,700
Hold on.

2516
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:03,400
I gotta give this guy a facility.

2517
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,300
Where he'll die apparently.

2518
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,220
Okay, shelter.

2519
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,760
You wanna cave?

2520
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:09,240
Yeah.

2521
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,660
Give you a...

2522
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:11,780
I gave him a bed.

2523
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:16,320
Where you want to go?

2524
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:21,880
We'll give him this wooden shelter.

2525
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,040
This size is good.

2526
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:31,460
But he probably wants something and people can't see him, right?

2527
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,400
Whoa.

2528
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,280
Maybe like this.

2529
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2530
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,960
There we go.

2531
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,380
Okay, are you happy with this?

2532
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,480
Everything green!

2533
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:44,640
Green!

2534
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,300
We're in the green, baby.

2535
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,080
We're in the green.

2536
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,820
Let's buy a new dragon.

2537
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,260
What?

2538
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,260
He's meowing at me.

2539
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,720
What are you doing, bro?

2540
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,780
Search Komodo dragon.

2541
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,600
We have another guy that is... Oh, wait.

2542
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:09,400
Stop!

2543
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,320
What are you doing?

2544
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,260
What?

2545
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,220
She's acting out because she wants out.

2546
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:19,100
What do the leaves mean?

2547
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:27,110
We have to replace them.

2548
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:29,890
We have to.

2549
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:33,010
You think we're getting enough money from these or...?

2550
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,590
Largest donation, $20!

2551
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:35,990
$80!

2552
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,850
Top species donation!

2553
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,910
What do you think of my zoo?

2554
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,070
Oh.

2555
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:42,370
Oh!

2556
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:43,590
We need education!

2557
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:45,310
Oh, shoot.

2558
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,690
Okay.

2559
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:46,790
Education, education.

2560
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,260
What are these?

2561
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,060
Where is education under?

2562
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:03,100
Blueprints?

2563
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,420
No.

2564
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:16,430
Woo, spooky tree!

2565
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,430
We get a spooky tree here.

2566
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,730
This is... this is nice.

2567
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:26,990
Yeah.

2568
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:28,050
Yeah.

2569
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:28,450
Decoration.

2570
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:32,110
Yeah.

2571
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:34,390
Oh, we gotta educate them.

2572
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:37,050
We gotta... the people want... knowledge!

2573
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:39,630
Hold on, pies.

2574
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:40,690
Hold on!

2575
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,030
The people want knowledge!

2576
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,390
Guest facility?

2577
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:51,410
Oh, we need them to take out more money.

2578
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:53,070
Uneven placement.

2579
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:55,670
What do you mean?

2580
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,210
Oh, you... no.

2581
01:49:57,470 --> 01:49:58,410
What do you mean by that?

2582
01:49:58,810 --> 01:49:59,310
Oh, here we go.

2583
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:02,590
Take out money so that you can donate.

2584
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:07,110
The tree of knowledge.

2585
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,390
Chief... beef!

2586
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,040
Wait.

2587
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:21,780
Wait.

2588
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:22,140
Wait.

2589
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,380
I saw it.

2590
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,340
It worked for a second.

2591
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,700
The people want beef?

2592
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,160
There we go.

2593
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,080
How do I educate them?

2594
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,320
The people are dumb.

2595
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,680
The people are so stupid.

2596
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,720
The people need to know.

2597
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,380
Don't bully the people.

2598
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,260
I have to.

2599
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:57,240
Viewing dome?

2600
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:01,560
Whoa.

2601
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:02,460
Wait.

2602
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:07,500
So we can dig underground and have people come view in the dome.

2603
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,940
That's exciting.

2604
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,120
Okay, hold on.

2605
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:13,300
Information.

2606
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:15,980
Projection screen.

2607
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,240
Information counter.

2608
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,540
No?

2609
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2610
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,120
What is this?

2611
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:35,410
Hashtag free pause.

2612
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:40,670
Are you... are you doing out little girl?

2613
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,790
Little ball.

2614
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:44,110
What are you laying on?

2615
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,450
Oh my gosh.

2616
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:48,910
She is my little hunter.

2617
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:50,590
I... she...

2618
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:52,170
Paws is so great.

2619
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:52,830
So...

2620
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:54,490
Um...

2621
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:55,630
Last night...

2622
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:57,710
She was staring at something.

2623
01:51:57,890 --> 01:51:59,170
And I was like...

2624
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:02,610
Usually when she stares like that, it's...

2625
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:03,870
It's gonna be a bug.

2626
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,690
It's gonna be a bug.

2627
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,550
And it's starting to get warm outside.

2628
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:09,930
So all the bugs are coming...

2629
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:11,530
Into my maid cafe.

2630
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:12,890
They think it's abandoned.

2631
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:13,610
But no!

2632
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,510
I'm haunting it!

2633
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:16,830
Anyway...

2634
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:17,990
She was staring at...

2635
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:19,630
I have this...

2636
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:20,070
I...

2637
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:21,470
Oh, she was staring at my bookshelf.

2638
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:22,190
And I was like...

2639
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:23,290
What does she see?

2640
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:24,890
What could be there?

2641
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:27,090
And...

2642
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:27,690
Um...

2643
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:29,190
I was...

2644
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:30,630
Looking at my bookshelf.

2645
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:31,050
And I was like...

2646
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:31,950
I don't see anything.

2647
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:33,430
Like, I was bending over.

2648
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:34,210
Looking under.

2649
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,030
Looking over.

2650
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:36,690
And...

2651
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:37,590
Then...

2652
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:39,770
I'm like...

2653
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:40,630
Standing there in silence.

2654
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:42,130
And I hear like this...

2655
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,130
Faint...

2656
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:44,750
Crinkle.

2657
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:47,190
Faint little rustle.

2658
01:52:47,710 --> 01:52:48,690
And I was like...

2659
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:50,910
Oh wait...

2660
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:53,690
I think there is something...

2661
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:54,930
There.

2662
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:56,690
She does see something.

2663
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:57,970
I thought maybe...

2664
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,170
Something caught her eye.

2665
01:52:59,390 --> 01:52:59,950
That like...

2666
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:01,070
She...

2667
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:02,730
Mistook for something else?

2668
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:03,190
I don't know.

2669
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,290
But uh...

2670
01:53:05,290 --> 01:53:06,450
I was like...

2671
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:06,970
Oh...

2672
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:08,070
Something is here.

2673
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:10,410
And I have a...

2674
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,190
A fake bouquet of flowers.

2675
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:14,010
It's a...

2676
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:15,030
I got it at a convention.

2677
01:53:15,490 --> 01:53:17,630
It's like a bouquet of flowers...

2678
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:19,330
Made out of...

2679
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:19,530
Like...

2680
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:20,290
They're like...

2681
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:22,310
Crocheted flowers.

2682
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:25,250
And...

2683
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:26,410
I...

2684
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:28,030
That was what was rustling.

2685
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:28,410
That was...

2686
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:30,130
It was the plastic from the bouquet.

2687
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:31,910
And...

2688
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:33,130
And...

2689
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:35,050
I look in there...

2690
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,230
And in between...

2691
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:37,430
Like the folds...

2692
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:38,810
Of the...

2693
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,470
Of the...

2694
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,190
What is keeping together...

2695
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:42,410
The bouquet...

2696
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:42,930
Is a...

2697
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:44,070
Cockroach!

2698
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:49,170
It's a cockroach!

2699
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:52,210
He was hiding in there!

2700
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:58,440
So I had to...

2701
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,500
Pick it up...

2702
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,300
Like I...

2703
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:02,180
Like I...

2704
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:02,980
Sealed it...

2705
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:04,720
So that I couldn't get out...

2706
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,440
And then I...

2707
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,240
Took it out...

2708
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,440
And went...

2709
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:09,880
With...

2710
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,360
With...

2711
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,160
So...

2712
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:12,720
I...

2713
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:12,840
I...

2714
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:12,980
I...

2715
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:13,120
I...

2716
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,020
It was gross!

2717
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,100
See if you can buy snakes.

2718
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:18,080
I don't think you can!

2719
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:19,400
I didn't see any snakes.

2720
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:20,820
How are you doing, Pies?

2721
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:21,560
She's fine.

2722
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,480
She's fine.

2723
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:25,160
She's fine.

2724
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:26,860
Is he fine?

2725
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:27,980
Is this guy okay?

2726
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,280
Oh yeah!

2727
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,200
He's good!

2728
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,640
He's 4 out of 5 stars, baby!

2729
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:37,980
She...

2730
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,960
Apply or remove contraception...

2731
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,000
Where's the other guy?

2732
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:44,420
Where is our other dragon?

2733
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:46,420
Excuse me...

2734
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:47,980
Oh, he's in here...

2735
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:49,900
Injured!

2736
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:51,420
Um...

2737
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:56,820
Why do my dragons keep getting injured?

2738
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,540
Oh, they're running, they're running...

2739
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:10,960
Look at him go!

2740
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,220
Did you see him run to this?

2741
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:13,940
It was so cute!

2742
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,540
He's got a problem to spell her in the...

2743
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,360
Oh, you can...

2744
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,880
You can inspect him from...

2745
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,580
Over there?

2746
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:20,960
Okay!

2747
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,360
You're the professional!

2748
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:22,800
Oh!

2749
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,140
Serious injury discovered!

2750
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:26,860
Uh-oh!

2751
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:27,780
Uh-oh!

2752
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:28,080
Uh-oh!

2753
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:28,500
Uh-oh!

2754
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:29,860
Run!

2755
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:30,480
Run!

2756
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:32,900
Run to the vet!

2757
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,380
Run to the surgery!

2758
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:35,900
Run!

2759
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,080
Run!

2760
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:38,920
Run!

2761
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:40,420
Run!

2762
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:42,900
Run!

2763
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,000
Run!

2764
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:45,380
Run!

2765
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,260
Run!

2766
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,640
Run!

2767
01:55:56,860 --> 01:55:57,500
Run!

2768
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:58,840
What was the injury, I wonder?

2769
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,940
Can't find an accessible keeper hut with space.

2770
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,760
What are you talking about?

2771
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:17,610
You guys keep calling it a raura.

2772
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:18,830
Raura.

2773
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:20,470
No.

2774
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:22,190
It's a raura.

2775
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:29,170
You need quarantine.

2776
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:30,490
Oh, okay.

2777
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:30,570
Okay.

2778
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,190
It assigned it for me.

2779
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,310
That's easy, I suppose.

2780
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:37,090
Right there.

2781
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:37,470
Nope.

2782
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:39,070
Right there.

2783
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:40,310
Oops.

2784
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:41,250
No, no, no, no.

2785
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:43,010
I said I needed it.

2786
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,590
I need the quarantine.

2787
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:55,730
Right there.

2788
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:57,150
Right there.

2789
01:56:57,790 --> 01:56:58,390
Right...

2790
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:01,970
Right...

2791
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:03,910
Right there.

2792
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:08,390
Okay, let me let my cat out.

2793
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:41,490
Okay.

2794
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:44,030
She has been freed.

2795
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:47,930
She has been freed, everybody.

2796
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:49,290
You need a quarantine.

2797
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:50,270
I already got one.

2798
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:52,510
Wait, do I need to...

2799
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:53,710
Have like a...

2800
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:55,310
A path way to it?

2801
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,030
This side?

2802
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:00,210
Oh, oops.

2803
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:01,030
I built it backwards.

2804
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:02,230
That's fine.

2805
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,690
They can...

2806
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,670
They can go and take a little walk.

2807
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,850
Take a hike.

2808
01:58:08,010 --> 01:58:08,650
Okay.

2809
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,040
Is my guy back?

2810
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,640
Did they fix him?

2811
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,360
Oh!

2812
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:16,920
They fixed her!

2813
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:18,960
Okay.

2814
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:19,640
Nice.

2815
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:21,000
We need a keeper hut.

2816
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:21,820
What are you talking about?

2817
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:23,660
I already have one.

2818
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,160
Right here.

2819
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:27,020
This is not a keeper hut.

2820
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,780
Oh wait, this is the trade center.

2821
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,700
This is...

2822
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,380
This is the hut.

2823
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,120
Staff room.

2824
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:36,960
Oh my god.

2825
01:58:40,830 --> 01:58:42,250
The people want...

2826
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,310
The people want...

2827
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:49,290
Better educated guests will spend more cash.

2828
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:50,510
Okay.

2829
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:52,810
Speakers, audio guides.

2830
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:53,910
Uh...

2831
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:54,510
Okay, speakers.

2832
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,820
Oh, we could put some benches too.

2833
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,540
Oh, not Zuki.

2834
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:06,060
Oh, Twilight.

2835
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,440
We want everything spooky.

2836
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:08,980
Oh, a spooky canopy.

2837
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:10,600
I like it.

2838
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,240
Uh...

2839
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:14,640
What's this?

2840
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,460
Spooky picnic bench.

2841
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,780
I like it.

2842
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:21,980
Uh...

2843
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,280
Uh...

2844
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:23,640
Later.

2845
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,320
Spooky bench.

2846
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,740
I like it.

2847
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,400
I...

2848
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,080
Obstructed.

2849
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:33,660
By who?

2850
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:34,600
By what?

2851
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,580
I don't think so.

2852
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,140
I don't think it's obstructed at all.

2853
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,320
You're ruining my...

2854
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,020
Good time.

2855
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:43,900
Please.

2856
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,380
Oh, here we go.

2857
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:50,200
Wait, but then you'll be facing away from the...

2858
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:51,500
From the iguanas.

2859
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:52,040
Oh, here we go.

2860
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:52,360
Here we go.

2861
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:57,710
What is it obstructed by?

2862
01:59:59,450 --> 02:00:00,430
Komodo dragons.

2863
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:01,170
I said iguanas.

2864
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,640
The dragons.

2865
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:12,750
What time is it anyway?

2866
02:00:13,010 --> 02:00:14,110
It's midnight.

2867
02:00:14,690 --> 02:00:14,970
It's midnight.

2868
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:15,630
Go home.

2869
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:18,370
It's 1am.

2870
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:20,510
Go home.

2871
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:25,850
Go home.

2872
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:26,190
Go home.

2873
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,290
Security.

2874
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:30,930
Uh...

2875
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:31,270
Education.

2876
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:31,950
Here we go.

2877
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:32,890
Visual.

2878
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:33,550
Visual media.

2879
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:36,670
Anything.

2880
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:39,670
Habitat web?

2881
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:41,890
That's made for me.

2882
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:47,910
Oh, people are gonna go crazy over that.

2883
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:52,370
Education board.

2884
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:53,670
We found it.

2885
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:57,530
Oh, wait.

2886
02:00:57,990 --> 02:00:58,430
Undo.

2887
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:00,070
Z.

2888
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:01,690
Here we go.

2889
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:02,610
Okay.

2890
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:05,250
We'll put one next to each.

2891
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:07,190
Uh...

2892
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:10,750
I also feel like we should be blasting...

2893
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,150
Here we are.

2894
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:11,630
Ambience.

2895
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:12,330
Not ambience.

2896
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,590
Educational speaker.

2897
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:13,970
Here we go.

2898
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:14,290
Here we go.

2899
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:17,890
Everybody needs it here.

2900
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:21,890
Everybody needs it here.

2901
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:21,930
Everybody needs it here.

2902
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:22,830
Besides...

2903
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:25,190
Beside each and every donation box.

2904
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:41,270
Very nice.

2905
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,270
The education is happening.

2906
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:47,550
Why?

2907
02:01:47,790 --> 02:01:48,330
Still zero.

2908
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,810
Hi to my favorite freaky med.

2909
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:54,650
Parasocial hours.

2910
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,450
What do you mean?

2911
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,430
Oh.

2912
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:03,550
Educational content non...

2913
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:04,230
Komodo dragon.

2914
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:04,770
There we go.

2915
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:08,410
Oh, I have to do it for every single one.

2916
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:09,690
Oh my gosh.

2917
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:13,170
Okay.

2918
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:14,350
Wait, where did I...

2919
02:02:14,350 --> 02:02:15,350
Where did I put them all?

2920
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:21,150
Let's turn on our...

2921
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:21,690
Here we go.

2922
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:22,110
Here we go.

2923
02:02:22,770 --> 02:02:23,430
There we go.

2924
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:25,030
Oh yeah.

2925
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,590
We have...

2926
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:27,250
We are reaching...

2927
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:28,370
Levels that...

2928
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,790
Have never been reached before.

2929
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:31,630
In terms of education.

2930
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:46,140
Oh yeah.

2931
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:46,780
Oh yeah.

2932
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:47,340
Oh yeah.

2933
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,480
And then this also needs to have a thing about...

2934
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:51,160
Komodo dragons.

2935
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:51,380
No?

2936
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,240
Oh, I can't?

2937
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:53,840
Get delete.

2938
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:54,900
Get rid of that.

2939
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:56,600
Huh.

2940
02:02:58,420 --> 02:02:59,780
Wait, I missed some?

2941
02:03:03,110 --> 02:03:04,330
Get educated.

2942
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:08,730
Everyone will know about the Komodo dragon.

2943
02:03:10,030 --> 02:03:10,710
Oh.

2944
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:13,510
Okay.

2945
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,310
That should be good.

2946
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:16,950
All right.

2947
02:03:17,070 --> 02:03:19,150
Everybody should be really feeling fulfilled now.

2948
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:21,410
The education is only at...

2949
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:22,470
10%.

2950
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:24,710
What do you mean?

2951
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:27,310
What do you mean?

2952
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,130
Why?

2953
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:35,990
Maybe they're not far in enough.

2954
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:37,350
Zero.

2955
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:38,450
Okay.

2956
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:39,630
That's just your ear...

2957
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:39,970
You're...

2958
02:03:39,970 --> 02:03:41,910
You have retention problems then.

2959
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:43,230
You're just not listening.

2960
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:46,110
You're just not doing a very good job.

2961
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,840
I'm allergic to knowledge.

2962
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,260
No!

2963
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:01,830
Only 10%.

2964
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,260
Guys, what are we doing wrong?

2965
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,960
Our zoo is really only at...

2966
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:14,280
One and a half stars.

2967
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:20,260
No educational content.

2968
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:21,400
Maybe...

2969
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:24,440
We were wrong to call you Sesame Street for 30 year olds.

2970
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:33,240
Do we need different boards on the wall?

2971
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:35,360
I tried to put those, but...

2972
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,200
Nothing worked.

2973
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,290
Like I couldn't...

2974
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:41,200
I couldn't...

2975
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:43,540
Oh wait, we gotta do our tunnel too.

2976
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,200
Let's do that.

2977
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:47,300
Let's get our tunnel going.

2978
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:48,460
Oh!

2979
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,280
What is this?

2980
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:57,780
Whoa!

2981
02:04:58,700 --> 02:04:59,360
Do-do-loo!

2982
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,060
Do-do-loo!

2983
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:01,860
Do-do-do!

2984
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,560
Boop-boop-boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2985
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,340
What's up?

2986
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,080
We'll do a ramp.

2987
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,580
I think we have to go from here.

2988
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:24,720
Okay.

2989
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:27,040
Ignore the ground here.

2990
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:30,740
Smooth it over, smooth it over.

2991
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:35,000
Where'd the grass come from?

2992
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,200
They hate the grass.

2993
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,140
Tuarego, thank you so much for the vibe.

2994
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:40,880
Good to take you.

2995
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,920
An escape tunnel.

2996
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:49,080
No, no, no, no.

2997
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,240
Hey, how are you feeling about your habitat?

2998
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:53,620
Too much long grass, right?

2999
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:56,660
You're hungry and thirsty?

3000
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,840
Well, eat then.

3001
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:03,670
Why are you hungry and thirsty?

3002
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:06,770
Oh, oh, oh no.

3003
02:06:07,010 --> 02:06:07,310
Wait.

3004
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:08,450
What's wrong?

3005
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:09,770
You need a key?

3006
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:10,830
Is it the keeper hut?

3007
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:11,730
Is that what's wrong?

3008
02:06:12,070 --> 02:06:12,630
Okay, hold on.

3009
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:19,640
Oh wait, we need it over here.

3010
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,080
I can't do it on the hill, I think.

3011
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:33,050
Okay, if we do it here.

3012
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:34,170
Like that.

3013
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:35,010
I think.

3014
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:36,570
This should be fine.

3015
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,450
This should be fine.

3016
02:06:38,510 --> 02:06:39,910
And then... path.

3017
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:44,060
This way.

3018
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:46,300
Yeah.

3019
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:47,300
Yeah, yeah.

3020
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:50,660
No.

3021
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,060
No, no, no, no.

3022
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,020
No, please.

3023
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,440
I think I have to get rid of some of our donation.

3024
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:01,220
Okay, okay, okay.

3025
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:02,000
Path.

3026
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:04,800
No!

3027
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:06,840
My car!

3028
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:07,880
Thank you so much for the vibe.

3029
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:08,660
Thank you!

3030
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:10,180
Oh, ah.

3031
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:11,000
I did it.

3032
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:11,380
I did it.

3033
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:11,700
I did it.

3034
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:11,900
Okay.

3035
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:13,400
Awesome.

3036
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:16,940
I have a quarantine!

3037
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,780
What do they need from me?

3038
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,440
What else do they want?

3039
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,400
I'll do another one, I guess.

3040
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:24,800
They're so picky.

3041
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:30,520
It's like they have, like, standards of living for these creatures or something, you know?

3042
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:32,280
God.

3043
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,770
Did you eat yet?

3044
02:07:40,130 --> 02:07:41,270
Did you eat?

3045
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:42,630
Did you eat?

3046
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:43,110
Is everything good?

3047
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:43,730
Did you eat?

3048
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:46,510
No.

3049
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:48,870
Where's our zookeeper?

3050
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,290
Why does he suck?

3051
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:53,470
Nobody outpeaches the hut.

3052
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,290
I can't run.

3053
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,230
Okay.

3054
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,510
Let's continue our tunnel.

3055
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:10,160
That doesn't really work, huh?

3056
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,880
Why does it sound so wet?

3057
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:17,780
Wait.

3058
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:18,600
Chisel?

3059
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:21,560
There we go, there we go, okay.

3060
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:26,440
We just gotta...

3061
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,040
smooth it over.

3062
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:29,440
Smooth, smooth.

3063
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:30,960
There we go, okay.

3064
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:31,680
Alright.

3065
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:40,130
You think you could fit in there?

3066
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:42,170
It's...

3067
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:43,910
It's a mouse simulator.

3068
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:49,570
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3069
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:54,670
Okay, we're digging.

3070
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:56,370
Dig.

3071
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:58,390
Dig, dig, dig.

3072
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:00,730
Push, push, push.

3073
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:02,750
Push, push.

3074
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:04,690
We'll find the dome eventually.

3075
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:06,250
Okay, okay.

3076
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:07,350
This is good, this is good.

3077
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:12,130
Push, push.

3078
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:13,910
Just like my mama says.

3079
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:14,470
Push, push.

3080
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:14,530
Push.

3081
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:16,530
I don't know where the dome is.

3082
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:20,870
It looks like an eyeball.

3083
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:21,690
It's kind of freaky.

3084
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:27,410
Why did I make it so far inward?

3085
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:32,230
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3086
02:09:32,650 --> 02:09:33,010
This is good.

3087
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:33,990
Maybe we start from here.

3088
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:35,950
What the hell is this?

3089
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:38,310
Dangerous animal?

3090
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:39,370
Wait, who escaped?

3091
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:39,890
Wait.

3092
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,650
Huh?

3093
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:41,170
How?

3094
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:41,770
Wait.

3095
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,130
Who escaped?

3096
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:43,710
Where?

3097
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:45,630
Um...

3098
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:45,950
How?

3099
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:47,590
Uh...

3100
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:48,090
Wait.

3101
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:48,790
Who escaped?

3102
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:51,970
Oh!

3103
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:53,970
How did he get out?

3104
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:00,990
I think he destroyed the fence.

3105
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,320
He's so chill.

3106
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:10,060
The vet is not doing anything.

3107
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:11,040
It's...

3108
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:11,410
Uh...

3109
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:13,080
Um...

3110
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,020
Where are you?

3111
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:14,500
Oh.

3112
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:15,640
That was a...

3113
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,680
That was a paying customer.

3114
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,660
Um...

3115
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,640
Uh...

3116
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,260
Oh!

3117
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,240
Wait a second.

3118
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,300
You...

3119
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,500
Emergency captures a thousand bucks?

3120
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,340
Well...

3121
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:31,980
I guess...

3122
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:32,140
Oh...

3123
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:33,240
Luckily we have...

3124
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:33,630
Um...

3125
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:37,360
Where's the other guy?

3126
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,540
I guess luckily we have unlimited money.

3127
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:42,260
Dangerous animal.

3128
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,260
It's a dragon.

3129
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,280
They're so dramatic.

3130
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,940
They are so dramatic.

3131
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,580
What was that?

3132
02:10:59,420 --> 02:10:59,940
Oh!

3133
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:03,720
Wait.

3134
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:05,140
What happened to our guys?

3135
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,160
Oh, they're putting them back inside?

3136
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:08,440
But, um...

3137
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,040
There's a giant hole in the fence.

3138
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:11,360
I don't think it works.

3139
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:13,620
Wait, there's a viewing dome!

3140
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:15,100
We can do that.

3141
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:17,580
Obstructed.

3142
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:18,060
Hold on.

3143
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:22,730
Get rid of you.

3144
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:26,670
Get rid of you.

3145
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,390
Can I?

3146
02:11:30,430 --> 02:11:30,950
Delete.

3147
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:31,310
Delete.

3148
02:11:33,690 --> 02:11:34,850
Okay, and then...

3149
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,270
Barrier.

3150
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:38,970
Oh, I saw it.

3151
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:40,570
It worked for just a second.

3152
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:41,790
For a brief moment.

3153
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:49,330
Hmm...

3154
02:11:49,330 --> 02:11:49,930
Never mind.

3155
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:50,730
I give up.

3156
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:52,630
Let's try...

3157
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:54,930
Uh...

3158
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:57,290
Steel mesh?

3159
02:11:58,630 --> 02:11:59,150
No?

3160
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:00,050
Oh, here we go.

3161
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:01,850
Perfect.

3162
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,810
Oh, this one's not broken.

3163
02:12:04,430 --> 02:12:06,710
So, surely nothing will get out.

3164
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:08,970
Okay.

3165
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:12,050
Unbox all animals.

3166
02:12:13,770 --> 02:12:14,970
They're fine.

3167
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:15,670
See?

3168
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,810
Happy people.

3169
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:20,810
Everybody's happy.

3170
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:22,610
Happy...

3171
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:23,770
Happy dragons.

3172
02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:30,330
Gosh, I really thought they got out from the hole for a second.

3173
02:12:30,330 --> 02:12:31,410
I was kind of scared.

3174
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:35,070
Okay, but I have to figure out also how to get...

3175
02:12:35,070 --> 02:12:36,030
From this hole.

3176
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:39,950
Why are they so...

3177
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:42,050
Why are they seem really determined to get to the hole?

3178
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:43,070
Wait a second.

3179
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:45,250
Does this fence look...

3180
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:46,770
Like, even more...

3181
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:47,430
Destroy...

3182
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:05,700
They sensed freedom!

3183
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,400
They knew!

3184
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,440
How to get to it!

3185
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:13,280
Okay, let's uh...

3186
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:14,580
Uh...

3187
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:23,510
Let's fix this again...

3188
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:26,390
Let's fix this again...

3189
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:27,850
Let's fix this again...

3190
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:29,930
Our steel mesh...

3191
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:30,730
Wait...

3192
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:32,430
What if I also make them higher?

3193
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:34,550
There we go.

3194
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:35,210
Nice.

3195
02:13:35,410 --> 02:13:35,530
Okay.

3196
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:37,500
And I see this part too...

3197
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:40,560
Wait, how do I...

3198
02:13:41,110 --> 02:13:41,650
Just...

3199
02:13:41,650 --> 02:13:42,610
Just stick it in there.

3200
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:43,410
Right in this...

3201
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,750
There we go.

3202
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:44,430
Yep.

3203
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:47,050
Okay.

3204
02:13:49,750 --> 02:13:51,150
All is good.

3205
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:54,270
All is well.

3206
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:04,600
These might break eventually...

3207
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,120
But...

3208
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:05,780
For right now...

3209
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:07,040
We have a tunnel to focus on.

3210
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:07,300
Okay?

3211
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:31,140
Oh my gosh.

3212
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:31,500
Kuya!

3213
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:33,460
Thank you so much for...

3214
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,580
The 50 gift!

3215
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:35,220
Thank you!

3216
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,080
Thank you so much!

3217
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,280
Push, push, push.

3218
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:41,860
We're pushing the dirt.

3219
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:50,080
We'll make it to the...

3220
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:51,060
Wait, how close are we?

3221
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:00,020
I'm stuck.

3222
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:01,380
I'm stuck in the ground.

3223
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:02,040
There we go.

3224
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:03,860
There we go.

3225
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:05,780
Oh yeah!

3226
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,960
I was gonna start from over here.

3227
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,420
This would probably be better.

3228
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:10,380
Start from here.

3229
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:20,150
Oh, no!

3230
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:24,840
Um...

3231
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,840
I'm struggling!

3232
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:30,040
Wait, maybe we do this.

3233
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:35,160
This might be...

3234
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,220
The better option.

3235
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:38,320
Wait, hold on.

3236
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:47,550
Imagine...

3237
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:47,650
Imagine...

3238
02:15:47,650 --> 02:15:48,650
Coming out of the bathroom...

3239
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:49,350
And seeing like...

3240
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:50,650
The exhibit completely open.

3241
02:15:51,730 --> 02:15:53,190
How do you feel about it?

3242
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:54,710
I love that...

3243
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:55,270
Toilet...

3244
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:56,250
Block 3...

3245
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:56,990
Cost nothing!

3246
02:16:00,410 --> 02:16:01,910
I wish I could have...

3247
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:02,950
Stayed longer...

3248
02:16:02,950 --> 02:16:04,210
To see the Komodo dragon.

3249
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,890
You could!

3250
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:05,630
You can!

3251
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:08,210
Where are they?

3252
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:10,290
Where are they?

3253
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:12,970
Where are my...

3254
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:16,730
Oh, I never...

3255
02:16:16,730 --> 02:16:17,550
I never...

3256
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:18,450
Release them!

3257
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:19,230
Oops!

3258
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:21,810
Charge the toilet?

3259
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:22,550
Yeah...

3260
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:23,470
What makes them happy?

3261
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:25,290
How do I...

3262
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:26,550
How do I make it not free?

3263
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:36,420
Hmm...

3264
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:38,300
I renamed it to the paid toilet.

3265
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:42,610
Oh, here we go.

3266
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:43,090
Price.

3267
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:49,180
A dollar.

3268
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:52,940
Super excited for Off-Kai.

3269
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:54,320
Thank you, Tonies!

3270
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,260
Thank you!

3271
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,460
Yeah, we've been losing money on the toilet.

3272
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:01,160
Honestly...

3273
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:03,700
We gotta...

3274
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:04,920
Have people pay to use it.

3275
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:06,780
I wish I could...

3276
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:07,800
See anything.

3277
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:09,660
When it gets dark, it's so hard to...

3278
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:10,720
Tell what's going on.

3279
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:13,540
Oh my god.

3280
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:19,440
Everything's falling apart.

3281
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:22,400
Everything is falling apart!

3282
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:23,360
You guys!

3283
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:26,840
Everything is falling apart!

3284
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:30,830
Yes.

3285
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:32,430
And...

3286
02:17:32,430 --> 02:17:32,990
To here?

3287
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:34,030
More?

3288
02:17:34,810 --> 02:17:35,330
More?

3289
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:36,330
How...

3290
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:37,510
More?

3291
02:17:37,850 --> 02:17:38,890
Why can't I...

3292
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:40,030
Why is this so hard?

3293
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:44,210
Why is this so hard to build?

3294
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:45,610
I don't understand it.

3295
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:58,520
Huh.

3296
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:00,440
That's the only way I know how to do it.

3297
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,700
Wait, is this broken too?

3298
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:03,440
No.

3299
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:03,460
No.

3300
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:07,140
I can't see anything.

3301
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:08,140
This is broken.

3302
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:13,030
No.

3303
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:13,770
Yes.

3304
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:15,050
Okay.

3305
02:18:15,690 --> 02:18:16,230
Alright.

3306
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:18,430
What just happened?

3307
02:18:20,070 --> 02:18:20,790
Oh!

3308
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,650
Oh, they're getting restless.

3309
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:23,650
I'm sorry!

3310
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:24,190
I'm sorry!

3311
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:29,530
They were restless!

3312
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:32,590
Oh my gosh.

3313
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:37,430
Dada was just like, I'm too old if we kept in this box!

3314
02:18:41,630 --> 02:18:44,990
I don't know any public toilets that you have to pay to use.

3315
02:18:45,870 --> 02:18:47,750
Uh, this is not a public toilet.

3316
02:18:48,090 --> 02:18:49,490
It's a toilet of...

3317
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,650
A um...

3318
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:51,450
Of a...

3319
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:52,050
Of a zoo.

3320
02:18:53,550 --> 02:18:54,570
Okay, here we go.

3321
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:56,000
Let's go back to our...

3322
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:58,700
To our...

3323
02:18:58,700 --> 02:18:59,320
To our mission.

3324
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,680
It's turning out great, you guys.

3325
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,180
It's turning out great.

3326
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:10,020
Uh...

3327
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:10,840
That don't...

3328
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:12,360
That doesn't look very good.

3329
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:16,160
Um, what's going on here?

3330
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:19,040
Um...

3331
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:21,400
There's no mechanics in the zoo.

3332
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:23,740
It's like really close to the tree.

3333
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:28,220
Oh, wait.

3334
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:28,660
Where...

3335
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:29,160
What broke?

3336
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:33,660
Aw, man.

3337
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,900
How did it break?

3338
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:50,520
There we go.

3339
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:52,520
There we go.

3340
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:52,780
Perfect.

3341
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:57,800
Running a zoo is hard, you guys.

3342
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,200
I gotta get a mechanic in here, too.

3343
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:04,140
Okay, you better go like, fix the...

3344
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:05,660
He's running.

3345
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:07,640
He's like, why didn't you call me sooner?

3346
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,720
We were two seconds away from a fire.

3347
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:17,100
Park has no maintenance.

3348
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:20,300
An educator.

3349
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:22,540
We need like three of you.

3350
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:25,480
Okay, do your jobs.

3351
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:27,300
Educate the people.

3352
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:32,460
I have keepers and mechanics and...

3353
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:33,360
And such.

3354
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:34,080
We're fine.

3355
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,370
Aw.

3356
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:44,170
Aw.

3357
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:46,510
Aw, they're so active.

3358
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:53,560
So active.

3359
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:55,980
Oh, this thing's about to deteriorate, huh?

3360
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:56,760
Oh.

3361
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:00,220
Oh, he's damaging the barriers.

3362
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,640
Wow, they really want to get free.

3363
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:04,140
Keep doing it.

3364
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:05,240
Which one is this?

3365
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,460
Who is this?

3366
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:07,640
Who's damaging the barrier?

3367
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:09,800
Inten.

3368
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:14,680
He says, screw you, chain link fence.

3369
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:19,430
Where's the other guy at?

3370
02:21:21,670 --> 02:21:22,270
Raura!

3371
02:21:22,670 --> 02:21:23,210
Where are you?

3372
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:27,910
Oh, there they are.

3373
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,280
They're planning.

3374
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:35,220
They're scheming.

3375
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:35,940
They're plotting.

3376
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:45,260
They know what to do to break the fet- Look at this.

3377
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:48,240
She really is just like, I'm dead.

3378
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:54,100
When night falls and nobody is watching...

3379
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:56,380
We'll burn it down.

3380
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:06,850
Planning her escape.

3381
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:09,250
The music is so...

3382
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:10,550
Mysterious.

3383
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:17,670
Aw.

3384
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:19,370
So cute.

3385
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:23,490
The animal models look really good in this game.

3386
02:22:27,210 --> 02:22:28,570
The tug.

3387
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:32,930
Oh, he's so sweet.

3388
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:37,430
Should give him a bed.

3389
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:38,430
Is this not their bed?

3390
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:40,870
This little pile of leaves?

3391
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:42,270
I think they like it.

3392
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:47,550
How do you feel?

3393
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:49,050
Do you feel educated little kid?

3394
02:22:49,470 --> 02:22:51,070
43% of knowledge.

3395
02:22:51,870 --> 02:22:52,770
You're hungry?

3396
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:54,090
Oh, I think our...

3397
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:55,530
I think our...

3398
02:22:57,410 --> 02:22:57,930
People...

3399
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:58,830
They want food.

3400
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:00,710
Wait, but we have a...

3401
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:02,550
We have a chief beef right here.

3402
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:02,570
There.

3403
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:07,070
Why is it losing money?

3404
02:23:08,110 --> 02:23:08,930
Uh-oh.

3405
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:15,070
Why does it keep saying I need a quarantine?

3406
02:23:15,090 --> 02:23:16,290
I have one.

3407
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:18,330
I'm so confused.

3408
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:21,950
Okay, I have a second one.

3409
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:24,590
Weird.

3410
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:26,990
Finally, that...

3411
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:29,530
Um...

3412
02:23:29,530 --> 02:23:30,290
That, uh...

3413
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:31,490
That notification is gone.

3414
02:23:32,390 --> 02:23:34,010
Because it's not a quarantine.

3415
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:34,830
What?

3416
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:35,450
It is!

3417
02:23:38,390 --> 02:23:39,850
Oh, it's a research center.

3418
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:50,300
How did Kevin James make this look easy?

3419
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:50,680
Who dat?

3420
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:53,360
Who's Kevin?

3421
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:54,280
Who's Kevin?

3422
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:56,060
What?

3423
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,020
Let's um...

3424
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:01,220
Let's see what we got for our twilight.

3425
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,580
We're gonna keep making our spooky...

3426
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:05,100
Our spooky place.

3427
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:08,980
Twilight pack.

3428
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,220
I paid money for this.

3429
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:12,480
Uh, nature?

3430
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:14,080
Barriers.

3431
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:15,660
Facilities.

3432
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:17,540
Uh, everything.

3433
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:18,160
Everything.

3434
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:22,200
A walkthrough exhibit.

3435
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:23,720
Whoa!

3436
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:28,410
Um...

3437
02:24:28,410 --> 02:24:29,610
Wherever we can put it.

3438
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:37,140
Right...

3439
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:37,900
Here.

3440
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:41,300
Where does it lead to?

3441
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:43,680
That's a great question.

3442
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,100
Many have often wondered.

3443
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:48,840
What was in here, anyway?

3444
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,520
Oh, rocks!

3445
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:56,740
What if we filled it with snakes?

3446
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,380
Let's see if we can get some.

3447
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:00,640
The market.

3448
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:10,910
Minto...

3449
02:25:10,910 --> 02:25:12,190
Plays Planet Zoo.

3450
02:25:12,470 --> 02:25:15,290
Also Minto plays Minecraft in Planet Zoo.

3451
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:19,890
Hi Minky, got any tapirs?

3452
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:21,070
We can get one.

3453
02:25:21,310 --> 02:25:23,230
I guess we don't have snakes after all, do we?

3454
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:26,450
Which I totally feel like those should be in the...

3455
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:30,630
In the spooky Twilight pack, but...

3456
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:31,630
Hmm...

3457
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:34,510
Disappointing, disappointing.

3458
02:25:35,030 --> 02:25:37,990
Why is this one so expensive and this one so cheap?

3459
02:25:44,850 --> 02:25:45,490
Hmm...

3460
02:25:51,270 --> 02:25:52,790
What can I put in here?

3461
02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:54,190
A hippo?

3462
02:25:56,430 --> 02:25:57,390
A monkey.

3463
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:03,450
Invalid destination.

3464
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:04,110
Uh oh.

3465
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:05,510
I think I bought...

3466
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:06,490
Wrong guy.

3467
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:08,150
Uh...

3468
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,510
Quick tread.

3469
02:26:10,590 --> 02:26:11,850
Take him back.

3470
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:14,110
Uh...

3471
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:14,950
I do return.

3472
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:16,770
Return to sender.

3473
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:19,490
Let's make a tapir...

3474
02:26:21,210 --> 02:26:21,610
Here.

3475
02:26:21,810 --> 02:26:23,030
Okay, so we do this.

3476
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:24,430
Path...

3477
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:34,630
This will be a pathway surrounding the uh...

3478
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:35,910
The tapir exhibit.

3479
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:38,470
Like so.

3480
02:26:38,650 --> 02:26:38,750
Okay.

3481
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:40,290
Now barriers.

3482
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:43,290
What's a guest gate?

3483
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:46,890
Tipir are...

3484
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:48,730
Are harmless little fellas.

3485
02:26:49,010 --> 02:26:50,010
So they could have a...

3486
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:51,510
Uh...

3487
02:26:51,510 --> 02:26:52,230
This...

3488
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:52,670
This one.

3489
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:00,520
Like this.

3490
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:03,480
I want that thing.

3491
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:06,580
Wait, what is it?

3492
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:07,600
Why is it brick?

3493
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:10,980
Wait, you won't be able to see them.

3494
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:13,300
Wait.

3495
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:16,140
You won't be able to see them.

3496
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:20,100
What sound does the tapir make?

3497
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:22,400
Uh...

3498
02:27:26,830 --> 02:27:27,730
Does this work?

3499
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:35,930
I don't understand.

3500
02:27:36,230 --> 02:27:36,750
I don't know.

3501
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:45,100
Wait, I can add windows, no?

3502
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:54,810
Uh...

3503
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,940
Link to a viewing dome.

3504
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:01,360
Oh...

3505
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,960
Wait, is that how that works?

3506
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:06,080
No way.

3507
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:07,480
Wait, where's the dome?

3508
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:10,560
Construction...

3509
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:11,580
Where... Where was the dome?

3510
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,480
Negative effects?

3511
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,260
What is it?

3512
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:22,470
This?

3513
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:25,830
They don't like the transformer?

3514
02:28:26,410 --> 02:28:26,770
What?

3515
02:28:26,890 --> 02:28:28,570
Do they expect us to not have electricity?

3516
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:30,150
Are they dumb?

3517
02:28:33,270 --> 02:28:35,110
I don't remember how we found the...

3518
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:35,890
The dome.

3519
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:37,370
Dome.

3520
02:28:39,070 --> 02:28:40,850
Oh wait, there are lights!

3521
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:41,650
Oh!

3522
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:44,150
Oh my gosh, finally.

3523
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:46,750
We'll make them spooky.

3524
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:48,230
Whoa!

3525
02:28:50,230 --> 02:28:50,910
A beacon.

3526
02:28:54,170 --> 02:28:54,810
Spooky.

3527
02:29:02,730 --> 02:29:05,510
Wait, these say mushrooms, but are they...

3528
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:07,210
Light up mushrooms, or...

3529
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:08,610
Whoa, this thing's huge!

3530
02:29:10,050 --> 02:29:10,690
Wow!

3531
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:11,910
That's cool!

3532
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:14,550
Oh, oh.

3533
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:16,530
Are they lit up?

3534
02:29:20,490 --> 02:29:22,050
I think, um...

3535
02:29:22,050 --> 02:29:23,610
We have a fungus problem.

3536
02:29:24,510 --> 02:29:25,070
Um...

3537
02:29:25,070 --> 02:29:25,930
This one...

3538
02:29:25,930 --> 02:29:28,010
Definitely, it looks like it would...

3539
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:29,690
Give you some sort of disease.

3540
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:31,490
Okay.

3541
02:29:34,390 --> 02:29:34,950
Uh...

3542
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:35,510
Dome.

3543
02:29:36,210 --> 02:29:37,090
Oh, floor lights.

3544
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:42,690
Watch out for the fire, everybody!

3545
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:45,170
Watch out for the fire!

3546
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:46,490
Hold your children!

3547
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:49,090
Decal bat.

3548
02:29:50,050 --> 02:29:51,270
How's that work?

3549
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:55,070
It looks like a slug to me.

3550
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:09,580
I feel I should maybe become a...

3551
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:10,800
A decorator.

3552
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:14,240
Of the interior and exterior kind.

3553
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:18,460
There's a...

3554
02:30:18,460 --> 02:30:18,640
There's a...

3555
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:20,880
There was a video that was cracking me up the other day.

3556
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,120
It's like these two ladies...

3557
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:24,580
I guess from the 90s or something...

3558
02:30:24,580 --> 02:30:26,040
That do interior decorating.

3559
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:28,200
And...

3560
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:31,100
They just actually ruin everything that they touch.

3561
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:33,020
And...

3562
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:36,040
And...

3563
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:41,400
They did one of a house where they were painting the wooden floor.

3564
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,580
They were painting the wooden floor and they were just like...

3565
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:47,100
Well...

3566
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:48,200
If you...

3567
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,700
Um...

3568
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:50,980
Don't want to get a carpet.

3569
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:53,060
You can just paint the floor instead.

3570
02:30:53,700 --> 02:30:55,840
And so they painted a carpet...

3571
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,140
That was...

3572
02:30:57,140 --> 02:30:59,380
Purple, yellow, and red.

3573
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:02,620
With black diamonds all around it.

3574
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:10,160
It was...

3575
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:10,680
It's...

3576
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:12,660
It's so bad.

3577
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,360
It's actually...

3578
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:19,900
Way worse than I'm even describing it.

3579
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:21,920
Like...

3580
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:22,820
It's...

3581
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:23,280
Terrible.

3582
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:23,880
Terrible.

3583
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:24,260
Wait.

3584
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:25,280
I didn't mean to do that.

3585
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,420
Who are you?

3586
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:29,980
Do you like my place?

3587
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:32,040
Oh, I thought you were an alien for a second.

3588
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:34,560
You're thirsty.

3589
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,940
You're going to go pee.

3590
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:39,960
Ain't nothing to lose.

3591
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:40,880
You like my place?

3592
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:41,960
You like my...

3593
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:42,140
Pad?

3594
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:45,920
Can I...

3595
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,420
Can people come to my...

3596
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:47,480
Zoo?

3597
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:52,320
How would you be able to come to my zoo?

3598
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:56,560
Wait, where'd you go?

3599
02:31:57,700 --> 02:31:58,500
There you are.

3600
02:31:59,200 --> 02:31:59,940
Just slurping.

3601
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:03,380
Well...

3602
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:04,920
Alright, how's your...

3603
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:05,760
How's your education?

3604
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:06,900
33%.

3605
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,880
You're stupid.

3606
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:09,860
You have...

3607
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:11,640
You actually do have nothing to lose.

3608
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:13,060
Because you have no brain cells.

3609
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:15,200
Wow, traffic jam.

3610
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:16,020
Right here.

3611
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:16,940
What the hell?

3612
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:20,760
The ticket price is fair.

3613
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:22,220
Why does that make you upset?

3614
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,240
Wait, you've been at my zoo for a month?

3615
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:27,980
How long have you been here?

3616
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:30,780
Okay, this month.

3617
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:40,890
Okay.

3618
02:32:41,730 --> 02:32:44,510
I gotta find the dome so that we can open this up.

3619
02:32:45,310 --> 02:32:46,170
Special effects.

3620
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:50,830
Ambiance.

3621
02:32:51,250 --> 02:32:51,850
Special effect.

3622
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:52,890
Dirt falling.

3623
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:56,290
I think the patrons would really enjoy that.

3624
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:02,390
Oh yeah, the patrons would really love the immersion of...

3625
02:33:02,390 --> 02:33:04,090
Dirt falling on their head.

3626
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:10,110
I've been standing there for weeks.

3627
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:12,030
Who are you?

3628
02:33:13,170 --> 02:33:13,690
Oops.

3629
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:15,610
Oh, I'm trying to click on her.

3630
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:20,550
I'm just trying to click on her.

3631
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:27,130
I need...

3632
02:33:27,130 --> 02:33:27,710
Oh, oh, oh.

3633
02:33:27,790 --> 02:33:29,970
Ice monkey to get the zoo five stars.

3634
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:31,430
Look, we're at...

3635
02:33:31,430 --> 02:33:33,150
We're at almost two stars though.

3636
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:34,450
Who are you?

3637
02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:36,150
Oh...

3638
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:37,510
You're an educator.

3639
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:38,930
Oh, okay.

3640
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:43,630
Clunk, clunk.

3641
02:33:43,850 --> 02:33:44,990
Clunk, clunk.

3642
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:47,590
Clunk, clunk.

3643
02:33:47,690 --> 02:33:48,670
Let's see.

3644
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:51,710
Dome.

3645
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:54,970
Dome.

3646
02:33:58,150 --> 02:34:00,130
What was it under, you guys?

3647
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:01,690
I can't remember at all.

3648
02:34:03,050 --> 02:34:03,810
Dome.

3649
02:34:03,810 --> 02:34:04,030
Dome.

3650
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:05,910
I don't know.

3651
02:34:06,130 --> 02:34:06,530
Oh, oh.

3652
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:07,430
The viewing dome.

3653
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:08,110
I got it.

3654
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:10,270
Okay.

3655
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:13,810
Now that...

3656
02:34:15,250 --> 02:34:15,930
Viewing dome.

3657
02:34:16,090 --> 02:34:17,090
Oh, place dome entrance.

3658
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:20,250
Is that not this?

3659
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:25,050
We

3660
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:40,950
got the entrance?

3661
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:43,290
Now let's bring in the tapirs.

3662
02:34:46,250 --> 02:34:48,570
People will be so like...

3663
02:34:48,570 --> 02:34:50,150
What could this be?

3664
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:51,770
They'll be like...

3665
02:34:51,770 --> 02:34:53,310
What is this exhibit?

3666
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:55,930
I can't see inside of it unless I go in.

3667
02:34:56,550 --> 02:34:57,330
Adopt.

3668
02:34:58,030 --> 02:34:58,810
Adopt.

3669
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:00,250
Adopt.

3670
02:35:01,050 --> 02:35:01,830
Adopt.

3671
02:35:01,830 --> 02:35:02,210
Adopt.

3672
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:03,950
Okay, send....

3673
02:35:05,690 --> 02:35:06,790
Send, send, send.

3674
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:12,020
Uh...

3675
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:12,780
Wait, where are you?

3676
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:13,660
Oh here we go.

3677
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:15,460
Send, send, send.

3678
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:19,100
Send.

3679
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:19,940
Send, send, send.

3680
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,120
Send, send, send.

3681
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:24,660
Okay.

3682
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:27,240
Then we'll see what they need once they're here.

3683
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,400
Hurry up.

3684
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:30,700
Oh, wow.

3685
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:32,920
The mushrooms really do light up a lot.

3686
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:34,420
Let's put some over here, too, then.

3687
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:36,740
Facilities.

3688
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,240
No.

3689
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:41,220
Habitat?

3690
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:41,640
No.

3691
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,720
What was it under?

3692
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:45,340
Oh, gosh.

3693
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:48,140
Why is it so hard to find anything in this game?

3694
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Content pack.

3695
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:54,360
Twilight pack.

3696
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:56,660
They need nightmares to feed off of.

3697
02:35:57,620 --> 02:35:59,280
And so they will get.

3698
02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:09,730
Hey, why don't these light up?

3699
02:36:11,370 --> 02:36:12,430
Hey, wait a second.

3700
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:17,200
Wait a second.

3701
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:18,460
Why aren't they lighting up?

3702
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:21,060
My little jack-o-lanterns.

3703
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:22,820
Oh, they're running.

3704
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:26,140
Okay, what do you need?

3705
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:28,660
More grass short.

3706
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:36,610
Okay.

3707
02:36:36,830 --> 02:36:37,950
So far, it's a good amount.

3708
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:41,570
But we're just getting rid of that long grass.

3709
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:42,830
We hate the long grass.

3710
02:36:43,230 --> 02:36:44,690
Nobody wants long grass.

3711
02:36:45,530 --> 02:36:46,950
We need more soil.

3712
02:36:57,050 --> 02:36:58,130
Long grass hate.

3713
02:36:58,690 --> 02:36:59,570
Hate, hate, hate.

3714
02:36:59,570 --> 02:36:59,630
Great.

3715
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:01,890
Okay.

3716
02:37:02,190 --> 02:37:02,530
Awesome.

3717
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:05,890
And we're still gotta get rid of the long grass.

3718
02:37:06,570 --> 02:37:07,830
We'll do more soil.

3719
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:16,960
Why is there so much long grass everywhere?

3720
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:29,510
Oh, they're screaming.

3721
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,780
I think we're...

3722
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:39,940
They're so picky.

3723
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:43,660
Eww.

3724
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:45,140
Eww.

3725
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:48,900
Oh, I see some long grass.

3726
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:55,640
They, like, see one grass blade get too high and they're like,

3727
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:01,580
What?

3728
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:02,420
Serious injury?

3729
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:04,040
Vet!

3730
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:04,880
Call the vet!

3731
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,220
Wait, how do I call the vet?

3732
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:08,140
Call the vet!

3733
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,140
Call the vet!

3734
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:14,960
Oh, overpopulation.

3735
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:16,440
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3736
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:20,280
Outsider.

3737
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:25,760
Oh, um,

3738
02:38:30,190 --> 02:38:32,570
is there mental health of serious injury?

3739
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:36,850
Okay, uh, anyway.

3740
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:39,730
What else do you need?

3741
02:38:41,430 --> 02:38:42,770
Hard shelter.

3742
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:43,950
Yes.

3743
02:38:45,250 --> 02:38:47,870
South Central America.

3744
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:51,330
Oh, wait.

3745
02:38:51,650 --> 02:38:54,290
Um, is this... can I... by content?

3746
02:38:54,430 --> 02:38:54,530
Yeah.

3747
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:55,950
There we go.

3748
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:56,270
Okay.

3749
02:38:57,330 --> 02:38:57,890
Bramble.

3750
02:38:58,550 --> 02:38:59,250
You like that?

3751
02:38:59,650 --> 02:39:00,390
You like that?

3752
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:01,950
You like this?

3753
02:39:02,310 --> 02:39:03,630
You like the bramble bush?

3754
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:05,510
You like a bramble bush for?

3755
02:39:06,070 --> 02:39:07,110
More bramble?

3756
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,340
You like that?

3757
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:12,860
You need a shelter?

3758
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,100
You want some rocks?

3759
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:17,800
A climbing rock?

3760
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:20,000
You want a rock here?

3761
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:21,040
Big ol' rock?

3762
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,300
You like it?

3763
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:27,480
Um...

3764
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:28,260
Bramble anyone?

3765
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:29,060
Yeah.

3766
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:29,120
Yeah.

3767
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,840
They need more plants.

3768
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:39,260
Let's get some... some bootin... b-b-b-boot... bootalia.

3769
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:42,060
And then I broke a bad tree.

3770
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:44,860
Okay, plants are getting there.

3771
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,940
Plants are getting there.

3772
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:48,000
More broken tree.

3773
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:50,620
Can we get a big tree in here?

3774
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:51,760
Oh, we could get a vine.

3775
02:39:59,390 --> 02:39:59,990
Okay.

3776
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,790
Whoa!

3777
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,810
Big tree.

3778
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:04,270
Alright!

3779
02:40:04,270 --> 02:40:04,650
Alright!

3780
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:05,170
Alright!

3781
02:40:05,370 --> 02:40:05,710
Alright!

3782
02:40:07,850 --> 02:40:11,090
Wait, but... how did we fix the problem?

3783
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:15,850
I said their injury was due to overpopulation.

3784
02:40:18,370 --> 02:40:21,310
Matured or introduced into overpopulated habitat.

3785
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:28,390
Um... Hmm... Facility.

3786
02:40:29,810 --> 02:40:31,690
It has to be there!

3787
02:40:31,850 --> 02:40:34,250
Everybody is just such sensitive babies.

3788
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:34,810
Babies.

3789
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:38,370
You think anyone's gonna come see the tapir?

3790
02:40:39,290 --> 02:40:42,810
Or... Why don't they... Why not?

3791
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:44,270
Oh, oh, oh!

3792
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:46,730
Oh, you're a security guard.

3793
02:40:47,210 --> 02:40:48,210
Oh, you're a keeper.

3794
02:40:48,450 --> 02:40:50,570
Wait, why aren't people coming to see the tapir?

3795
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:01,460
Did I plant these outside the... Oops.

3796
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:04,680
My bad.

3797
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:07,520
Okay, hold on.

3798
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:08,700
I'm gonna pause...

3799
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:12,460
Uh... Before, so that things don't become released.

3800
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:14,000
Oh, wait.

3801
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:14,940
Maybe I can do this.

3802
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:17,900
Let's do this.

3803
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:18,920
Watch, watch, watch.

3804
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,520
Watch and learn.

3805
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:22,740
Watch and learn.

3806
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:25,320
Oh.

3807
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:26,260
That's a gate.

3808
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:27,800
Um... Watch and learn.

3809
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:28,800
Watch and learn.

3810
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:32,900
More steel mesh.

3811
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:38,360
More steel mesh.

3812
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:42,220
Bigger.

3813
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:42,640
Oh.

3814
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:44,360
Wait, where'd my steel mesh go?

3815
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:46,220
Just kidding.

3816
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,300
No more steel mesh.

3817
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:54,560
Okay, now it's bigger.

3818
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:03,980
It's not overpopulated now, is it?

3819
02:42:09,430 --> 02:42:12,070
Uh... Grass long too much.

3820
02:42:12,330 --> 02:42:13,850
Yeah, I feel that too.

3821
02:42:14,130 --> 02:42:15,170
We need more soil.

3822
02:42:18,210 --> 02:42:19,410
More soil!

3823
02:42:27,490 --> 02:42:31,350
Everybody can just go into the tube and then they'll see the tapir.

3824
02:42:32,110 --> 02:42:33,270
That's all they have to do.

3825
02:42:33,950 --> 02:42:34,350
What's this?

3826
02:42:35,170 --> 02:42:36,450
Navigable swimming area.

3827
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:37,250
Okay.

3828
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:40,350
We construct.

3829
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:45,210
Wait, how did I do that again?

3830
02:42:45,350 --> 02:42:45,710
Oh, terrain.

3831
02:42:45,830 --> 02:42:46,090
Here we go.

3832
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:56,590
Uh... There was like the ones... Oh, here we go.

3833
02:42:56,650 --> 02:42:57,030
The stamp.

3834
02:42:57,230 --> 02:42:57,470
Yeah, yeah.

3835
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:04,070
There's no viewing space.

3836
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:04,970
But the tunnel!

3837
02:43:05,230 --> 02:43:05,530
Wait!

3838
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:06,630
People are going in!

3839
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:08,150
It's working!

3840
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:09,970
It's... Oh.

3841
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:11,950
I think I just killed that guy.

3842
02:43:13,250 --> 02:43:14,530
There's people inside!

3843
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:18,930
Oh my god!

3844
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:19,610
Whoa!

3845
02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:23,250
They're up and close with them!

3846
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:27,870
It's almost like...

3847
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:28,850
...the people...

3848
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:31,890
...are the exhibit to the tapir.

3849
02:43:31,890 --> 02:43:31,990
There.

3850
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:44,770
Um...

3851
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:45,050
Okay.

3852
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,790
Water.

3853
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:50,310
Terrain.

3854
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:54,790
Yeah!

3855
02:43:55,110 --> 02:43:55,590
There you go!

3856
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:56,110
There you go!

3857
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:57,430
Oh yeah!

3858
02:43:57,690 --> 02:43:58,030
Oh yeah!

3859
02:43:58,330 --> 02:43:58,590
Oh yeah!

3860
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:01,310
I just...

3861
02:44:01,310 --> 02:44:02,290
I just killed that guy.

3862
02:44:03,890 --> 02:44:04,450
Oops!

3863
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:05,270
No, no, no!

3864
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:06,090
More water!

3865
02:44:06,270 --> 02:44:06,870
More water!

3866
02:44:07,070 --> 02:44:07,550
Water!

3867
02:44:08,010 --> 02:44:08,510
Water!

3868
02:44:10,410 --> 02:44:10,970
Okay.

3869
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:12,510
Very good.

3870
02:44:15,930 --> 02:44:17,950
This guy is giving him a show, huh?

3871
02:44:20,230 --> 02:44:22,390
How is there still overpopulation?

3872
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:28,490
I think we're gonna have to sell one off.

3873
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:29,150
I think.

3874
02:44:29,650 --> 02:44:31,210
Can you put more domes?

3875
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:31,790
Let's try.

3876
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:32,770
That's a good idea.

3877
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:34,590
What was it under?

3878
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:38,050
Habitat?

3879
02:44:38,510 --> 02:44:38,670
Yeah.

3880
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:49,850
That's the dome entrance.

3881
02:44:50,030 --> 02:44:50,170
Okay.

3882
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:55,770
I am inside the dome entrance to Habitat.

3883
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:57,110
And it's great!

3884
02:44:58,970 --> 02:44:59,930
Well, they're running.

3885
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:01,010
They're happy.

3886
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:02,470
Except they're not.

3887
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:05,690
They're happy.

3888
02:45:05,950 --> 02:45:06,630
But like, not really.

3889
02:45:08,850 --> 02:45:10,310
Water reduces area.

3890
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:11,770
Maybe I should have made it smaller.

3891
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:13,690
But it said that they...

3892
02:45:13,690 --> 02:45:15,230
Oh, shelter, shelter, shelter.

3893
02:45:16,850 --> 02:45:17,350
Um...

3894
02:45:17,350 --> 02:45:18,010
Shelter, shelter.

3895
02:45:18,270 --> 02:45:19,030
Oh, food and water.

3896
02:45:20,070 --> 02:45:21,070
Feeding station.

3897
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,300
I don't know how to tell what they need for their food and...

3898
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:28,680
You know?

3899
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:31,300
Doesn't really explain much.

3900
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,520
In terms of that.

3901
02:45:38,330 --> 02:45:39,990
Like, it just said that they need it.

3902
02:45:40,130 --> 02:45:41,750
And I'm like, well, which one do they need?

3903
02:45:44,130 --> 02:45:44,470
Enrichment!

3904
02:45:47,430 --> 02:45:47,910
Um...

3905
02:45:47,910 --> 02:45:49,210
Beds and shelter.

3906
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:51,690
Do they burrow, or...?

3907
02:45:55,090 --> 02:45:56,490
Do they just want some leaf?

3908
02:45:57,970 --> 02:45:59,530
You can use the filters?

3909
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:01,550
Oh, by species?

3910
02:46:03,050 --> 02:46:04,330
Oh, that's helpful.

3911
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:05,790
I didn't even realize there was that.

3912
02:46:06,830 --> 02:46:07,310
Uh...

3913
02:46:07,310 --> 02:46:08,410
It starts with a B, right?

3914
02:46:08,410 --> 02:46:10,550
There we go.

3915
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:12,270
Aha!

3916
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:17,560
Oh my god, they're swimming!

3917
02:46:20,700 --> 02:46:21,840
That's so cute!

3918
02:46:23,400 --> 02:46:24,540
This thing's huge.

3919
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:32,580
Perfect.

3920
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:34,680
And now, enrichment.

3921
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:37,600
Which, uh...

3922
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:37,860
Where?

3923
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:45,320
Gardening.

3924
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:48,460
Animal exhibit?

3925
02:46:48,700 --> 02:46:48,800
No.

3926
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:50,840
Where was it again?

3927
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:51,760
Habitat.

3928
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:54,100
Oh, enrichment!

3929
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:55,880
I knew that.

3930
02:46:56,940 --> 02:46:58,280
They want a tire.

3931
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:01,360
They want that...

3932
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:01,660
Uh...

3933
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:02,560
Scratching tree!

3934
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:04,400
That's always fun.

3935
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:07,220
Oh, see?

3936
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:07,620
Yeah, yeah!

3937
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:08,840
People are using both now!

3938
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:09,780
Awesome.

3939
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:13,380
Heh heh heh heh!

3940
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:14,280
Okay, this is too big.

3941
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:15,600
A rubbing pillar?

3942
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,220
They would like that, right?

3943
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,100
Uh...

3944
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:24,640
Why can't I place it anywhere?

3945
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:25,960
Right?

3946
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:27,940
Uh...

3947
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:28,380
Right?

3948
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:29,760
Uh...

3949
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:31,500
Uh...

3950
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:32,740
Uh...

3951
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:33,360
Uh...

3952
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:33,840
Right?

3953
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:36,740
I saw it light up for a second.

3954
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,120
I don't think they need all this water.

3955
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:41,600
Heh heh heh heh.

3956
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:42,000
Heh heh heh heh.

3957
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:42,940
Heh heh heh heh.

3958
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:44,420
Right there.

3959
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:45,540
Perfect.

3960
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:48,100
Enrichment, 50%.

3961
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:49,540
Herb scent marker.

3962
02:47:57,840 --> 02:47:58,260
Okay.

3963
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:00,360
That didn't do much.

3964
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:02,640
Large barrel feeder.

3965
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:03,520
Like that.

3966
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:05,620
A box?

3967
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:07,300
They like that?

3968
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:07,640
Okay.

3969
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:13,550
Okay.

3970
02:48:13,870 --> 02:48:15,430
Someone's gonna have to leave.

3971
02:48:15,910 --> 02:48:17,910
And I think it's gonna have to be...

3972
02:48:21,090 --> 02:48:22,090
This one.

3973
02:48:23,290 --> 02:48:25,710
The tapirs demand a 5090.

3974
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:28,730
I can't do it!

3975
02:48:29,230 --> 02:48:30,790
Mr. Bright, thank you so much for the 50.

3976
02:48:31,150 --> 02:48:32,150
Thank you!

3977
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:37,070
Send animal to storage.

3978
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:38,650
Sayonara.

3979
02:48:41,650 --> 02:48:42,830
Send to...

3980
02:48:42,830 --> 02:48:43,650
...to storage.

3981
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:45,430
Sayonara.

3982
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:48,070
I guess we'll only have two tape here.

3983
02:48:49,390 --> 02:48:49,910
Sad.

3984
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,450
Aww.

3985
02:48:51,610 --> 02:48:52,890
I wanted a bunch of them.

3986
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:56,030
Unless I made the whole facility tape here.

3987
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:01,970
Goodbye.

3988
02:49:04,270 --> 02:49:04,790
Goodbye.

3989
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:11,480
Why are people upset about my zoo?

3990
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:15,040
What are the guests unhappy about?

3991
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:16,920
Look how many unhappy people there are.

3992
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:18,780
What are you unhappy about?

3993
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:23,200
These facility buildings are ruining my experience of the zoo.

3994
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:25,700
There has to be facility buildings.

3995
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:26,560
Like you just...

3996
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:28,380
You just have to...

3997
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:29,580
Why aren't there any benches?

3998
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:30,100
Oh.

3999
02:49:32,980 --> 02:49:35,140
The people yearn to sit.

4000
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:38,700
The people yearn for a place to rest...

4001
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:40,460
They're feet.

4002
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:44,340
High amounts of litter.

4003
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:45,440
Where?

4004
02:49:53,050 --> 02:49:54,170
Uneven placement.

4005
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:58,470
The people's feet's hurt.

4006
02:49:59,890 --> 02:50:00,970
What just happened?

4007
02:50:06,610 --> 02:50:07,290
Wait.

4008
02:50:07,390 --> 02:50:08,810
Why is there a disease risk?

4009
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:10,110
What is this?

4010
02:50:10,670 --> 02:50:11,310
What is that?

4011
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:14,150
I think I need to hire more people.

4012
02:50:17,890 --> 02:50:19,930
Let's hire some more zookeepers.

4013
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:23,470
Get in here.

4014
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:25,290
Fix it up.

4015
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:25,910
Fix it up.

4016
02:50:27,290 --> 02:50:28,130
Fix it up.

4017
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:28,770
Fix it up.

4018
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:34,990
I don't know why I'm being stingy when I have unlimited money.

4019
02:50:37,430 --> 02:50:39,210
I have unlimited money.

4020
02:50:40,110 --> 02:50:40,590
And yet.

4021
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:45,870
Wait.

4022
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:47,190
Were both tapir removed?

4023
02:50:48,970 --> 02:50:49,490
No.

4024
02:50:49,690 --> 02:50:50,150
Here's one.

4025
02:50:51,870 --> 02:50:52,390
Habitat.

4026
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:55,550
Moderate environmental welfare.

4027
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:57,230
The cleanliness.

4028
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:57,610
Oh.

4029
02:50:57,910 --> 02:50:58,430
Is it these?

4030
02:50:58,550 --> 02:51:00,770
They don't like the herb things or...

4031
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:04,370
I think it highlighted those.

4032
02:51:04,610 --> 02:51:05,970
They were like, that's nasty.

4033
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:07,270
Nobody wants that in here.

4034
02:51:07,270 --> 02:51:07,830
Um.

4035
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:12,890
Nobody wants it.

4036
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:19,070
Are you happy?

4037
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:23,330
I didn't come here to see the staff facilities.

4038
02:51:23,330 --> 02:51:27,050
These people are so, like...

4039
02:51:27,050 --> 02:51:28,430
Stingy, no?

4040
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:28,590
No.

4041
02:51:30,530 --> 02:51:32,730
I think the tapir are pooping.

4042
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,830
Hoppity hoppo.

4043
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:39,350
There isn't much to see in this zoo.

4044
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:45,310
We have literally the two best animals in the world.

4045
02:51:46,210 --> 02:51:47,970
Oh, I forgot about...

4046
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:48,790
Are you doing okay?

4047
02:51:49,150 --> 02:51:51,450
Oh, his habitat's like 99%.

4048
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:53,150
He doesn't care about this tall grass at all.

4049
02:51:57,560 --> 02:52:00,400
Oh, let's see the donation boxes.

4050
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:03,480
Donations.

4051
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:08,300
Everybody send in your donations.

4052
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:13,100
Or else we'll have to go bankrupt.

4053
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:15,460
Where is the donation?

4054
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:18,060
Donations.

4055
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:21,720
Where was it again?

4056
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:30,180
I won't be able to feed my family without your donations.

4057
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:35,220
Education soundboard.

4058
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:36,640
That's huge.

4059
02:52:40,580 --> 02:52:41,960
Boom, boom, boom.

4060
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:45,380
Where...

4061
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:49,020
Where is the donation?

4062
02:52:53,470 --> 02:52:55,870
This zoo needs memberships.

4063
02:52:56,110 --> 02:52:56,590
Oh, yeah.

4064
02:52:56,930 --> 02:52:59,170
I would get a lifetime membership for this zoo.

4065
02:52:59,690 --> 02:53:01,150
I would, I would, I would.

4066
02:53:02,130 --> 02:53:03,190
Oh, how cute.

4067
02:53:04,990 --> 02:53:05,670
River.

4068
02:53:06,730 --> 02:53:07,410
Transport.

4069
02:53:08,990 --> 02:53:10,350
Suspended gondola.

4070
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:21,480
I'll complete.

4071
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:27,940
I think it's good.

4072
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:32,660
Oh, you can do it.

4073
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:35,720
You can do it.

4074
02:53:49,670 --> 02:53:51,190
You can do it.

4075
02:53:51,510 --> 02:53:52,630
Oh, it's almost there.

4076
02:53:52,830 --> 02:53:53,190
Oh my God.

4077
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:54,150
Oh my God.

4078
02:53:54,310 --> 02:53:54,830
It's almost there.

4079
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:55,610
Oh, oh.

4080
02:53:56,130 --> 02:53:57,130
Missed the mark, buddy.

4081
02:54:02,910 --> 02:54:05,890
This is the best gondola ride ever.

4082
02:54:06,830 --> 02:54:07,450
Oh.

4083
02:54:12,390 --> 02:54:15,430
Build one kilometer of a tracked ride.

4084
02:54:17,410 --> 02:54:18,290
Nice.

4085
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:20,350
Does it just, uh...

4086
02:54:20,970 --> 02:54:21,570
End?

4087
02:54:25,250 --> 02:54:27,430
The game is trying to kill my patrons.

4088
02:54:28,730 --> 02:54:32,050
I didn't realize you were playing roller coaster tycoon.

4089
02:54:37,180 --> 02:54:37,860
I didn't realize you were playing roller coaster.

4090
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:42,900
Whoa.

4091
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:44,680
Whoa.

4092
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:46,980
Whoa.

4093
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:48,240
Whoa.

4094
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:49,440
Oh.

4095
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:53,220
Please.

4096
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:54,660
Let me back into my...

4097
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:57,300
The camera is...

4098
02:54:57,300 --> 02:54:57,980
Oh, please.

4099
02:54:58,160 --> 02:54:59,280
Let me back into my park.

4100
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:00,180
Please.

4101
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:02,100
Please let me back into my park.

4102
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:02,840
Please.

4103
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:05,680
Please.

4104
02:55:06,780 --> 02:55:07,180
Please.

4105
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:08,680
Please.

4106
02:55:08,820 --> 02:55:10,480
I wish to be a part of my park.

4107
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:13,400
Please.

4108
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:16,380
Let me in.

4109
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:18,580
Oh, here we go.

4110
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:18,940
Here we go.

4111
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:19,320
Okay.

4112
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:19,920
Awesome.

4113
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:20,280
Awesome.

4114
02:55:20,380 --> 02:55:20,520
Awesome.

4115
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:20,900
Okay.

4116
02:55:21,580 --> 02:55:23,120
I think we need, uh...

4117
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:24,000
A pathway to this.

4118
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:31,180
How do you actually use...

4119
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:31,860
How do you...

4120
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:36,180
How do we connect this?

4121
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:40,660
Maybe here?

4122
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:42,980
How do people use it?

4123
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:48,160
I'm actually not quite sure.

4124
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:51,980
Um...

4125
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:53,720
Oh.

4126
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:54,840
Mysterious.

4127
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:58,180
Quite a vista, eh?

4128
02:55:58,280 --> 02:55:58,840
I know.

4129
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,560
We have the most beautiful...

4130
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:01,660
Park in the world.

4131
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:02,580
Despite what...

4132
02:56:02,580 --> 02:56:03,480
Guests...

4133
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:04,980
They don't like...

4134
02:56:04,980 --> 02:56:06,020
Any of these buildings.

4135
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:11,520
They're so ridiculous.

4136
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:12,940
But look.

4137
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:13,780
The happy faces.

4138
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:17,900
Incomplete track.

4139
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:19,060
I tried.

4140
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:21,000
Okay, hold on.

4141
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:21,680
Let's try it again.

4142
02:56:31,870 --> 02:56:32,470
Um...

4143
02:56:32,470 --> 02:56:33,450
How do I...

4144
02:56:35,090 --> 02:56:35,690
Uh...

4145
02:56:35,690 --> 02:56:36,370
Edit track.

4146
02:56:36,510 --> 02:56:36,830
There we go.

4147
02:56:37,150 --> 02:56:37,270
Okay.

4148
02:56:38,250 --> 02:56:38,930
Auto-complete.

4149
02:56:39,850 --> 02:56:42,030
Oh, jeez.

4150
02:56:47,830 --> 02:56:48,830
I just...

4151
02:56:48,830 --> 02:56:50,690
I don't know where it's trying to go.

4152
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:54,520
Uh...

4153
02:56:54,520 --> 02:56:56,060
I don't know where it's trying to go.

4154
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:04,020
Uh...

4155
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:09,640
Hmm.

4156
02:57:15,370 --> 02:57:16,530
Minto, what have you done?

4157
02:57:16,850 --> 02:57:17,350
Nothing.

4158
02:57:18,350 --> 02:57:20,630
I'm trying to enhance my park.

4159
02:57:22,390 --> 02:57:24,510
It's not my fault that the...

4160
02:57:24,510 --> 02:57:25,970
The AI sucks.

4161
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:30,270
X-ray of my tapeworm.

4162
02:57:30,470 --> 02:57:30,950
Like,

4163
02:57:37,220 --> 02:57:40,620
where is it supposed to go?

4164
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:42,240
I think to the entrance, no?

4165
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:45,680
Hmm...

4166
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:46,440
It'll get there.

4167
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,060
It's almost there.

4168
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:50,060
Why doesn't it just go around?

4169
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:53,840
Oh, wow.

4170
02:57:55,100 --> 02:57:55,460
It's...

4171
02:57:55,460 --> 02:57:56,920
They're really taking the long way.

4172
02:57:57,160 --> 02:57:59,440
They've passed the entrance, like, five times now.

4173
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:01,860
I don't know.

4174
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:02,320
So close.

4175
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:02,980
Oh my god.

4176
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:03,480
We're over there.

4177
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:04,060
Oh, nope.

4178
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:05,460
So close.

4179
02:58:06,620 --> 02:58:07,340
So close.

4180
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:10,760
I don't think I can get out of this either.

4181
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:15,220
I think I'm stuck in this mode.

4182
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:15,520
Oh.

4183
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:16,760
Oh.

4184
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:17,460
Whoa.

4185
02:58:18,300 --> 02:58:18,800
Wait.

4186
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:19,750
It created a...

4187
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:21,000
Wait.

4188
02:58:21,140 --> 02:58:22,900
Is that inside the tape here?

4189
02:58:27,490 --> 02:58:28,250
Oh my gosh.

4190
02:58:28,250 --> 02:58:28,990
We're so close.

4191
02:58:32,010 --> 02:58:32,510
Okay.

4192
02:58:32,530 --> 02:58:32,910
Hold on.

4193
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:34,130
Now from here...

4194
02:58:38,930 --> 02:58:39,430
Okay.

4195
02:58:39,450 --> 02:58:39,830
Hold on.

4196
02:58:40,850 --> 02:58:42,830
From here, start test.

4197
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:50,240
There it goes so slowly.

4198
02:58:53,980 --> 02:58:55,160
We could change the color.

4199
02:58:55,800 --> 02:58:56,840
That's exciting.

4200
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:00,500
I'll change it to...

4201
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:01,740
Minto.

4202
02:59:06,670 --> 02:59:07,510
Okay.

4203
02:59:07,550 --> 02:59:07,930
Hold on.

4204
02:59:08,810 --> 02:59:09,770
Maybe I'll...

4205
02:59:09,770 --> 02:59:12,410
Maybe I have to build another station.

4206
02:59:14,010 --> 02:59:14,430
Right?

4207
02:59:16,430 --> 02:59:17,410
Is it sick?

4208
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:21,050
Oh my god.

4209
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:21,570
Did you hear that?

4210
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:22,450
It was my tummy around.

4211
02:59:24,930 --> 02:59:25,930
I'm hungry.

4212
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:31,330
Here we go.

4213
02:59:48,290 --> 02:59:49,770
I think it needs...

4214
02:59:49,770 --> 02:59:51,430
It's trying to go back to where...

4215
02:59:52,070 --> 02:59:52,630
Oh.

4216
02:59:53,210 --> 02:59:53,970
That's why.

4217
02:59:54,970 --> 02:59:55,510
Oh.

4218
03:00:00,310 --> 03:00:00,850
Oh.

4219
03:00:02,110 --> 03:00:02,290
Wait.

4220
03:00:02,390 --> 03:00:03,450
This one's so nice though.

4221
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:04,470
You'll get the whole view.

4222
03:00:07,450 --> 03:00:07,990
Yeah.

4223
03:00:09,290 --> 03:00:10,290
I want to get off.

4224
03:00:10,850 --> 03:00:11,230
This...

4225
03:00:11,230 --> 03:00:12,570
This wild ride.

4226
03:00:14,110 --> 03:00:14,650
Wait.

4227
03:00:14,730 --> 03:00:15,650
Where did the gondola go?

4228
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:19,830
Is it still traveling?

4229
03:00:20,650 --> 03:00:20,790
Oh.

4230
03:00:20,930 --> 03:00:21,030
Yep.

4231
03:00:21,790 --> 03:00:22,890
Nice and slow.

4232
03:00:26,490 --> 03:00:27,730
Can I ride it too?

4233
03:00:32,770 --> 03:00:33,250
Guys.

4234
03:00:35,970 --> 03:00:37,030
I have interest.

4235
03:00:37,410 --> 03:00:38,810
I'm riding with...

4236
03:00:38,810 --> 03:00:39,470
With...

4237
03:00:39,470 --> 03:00:39,570
Wait.

4238
03:00:39,890 --> 03:00:40,150
I'm...

4239
03:00:40,150 --> 03:00:41,270
I'm on top of the...

4240
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:41,590
Wait.

4241
03:00:43,650 --> 03:00:44,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4242
03:00:44,610 --> 03:00:45,330
I don't like that part.

4243
03:00:45,530 --> 03:00:46,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4244
03:00:46,670 --> 03:00:47,390
Whoa, whoa.

4245
03:00:51,610 --> 03:00:52,570
Whoa, whoa.

4246
03:00:52,570 --> 03:00:53,750
I'm in the seat.

4247
03:00:54,310 --> 03:00:55,070
Wait.

4248
03:00:55,150 --> 03:00:55,850
I want to look around.

4249
03:00:56,070 --> 03:00:56,370
Stop.

4250
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:03,360
This is so exciting.

4251
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:06,660
Max speed.

4252
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:11,830
We're on the ride.

4253
03:01:15,850 --> 03:01:16,610
Oh.

4254
03:01:16,950 --> 03:01:17,310
Whoopsie.

4255
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:19,390
Where'd it go?

4256
03:01:21,550 --> 03:01:22,490
Where'd it go?

4257
03:01:23,810 --> 03:01:24,210
Oh.

4258
03:01:24,210 --> 03:01:24,630
Oh, there it is.

4259
03:01:26,530 --> 03:01:27,990
The music is so dramatic.

4260
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:33,660
Let me look around.

4261
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:37,260
Wow.

4262
03:01:37,960 --> 03:01:38,160
Wait.

4263
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:39,360
We're going to see the tapirs.

4264
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:45,060
Where are they?

4265
03:01:46,660 --> 03:01:47,600
I guess over there.

4266
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,300
We're blocking, like, all the mountain view.

4267
03:02:01,400 --> 03:02:03,800
I guess they're trying to be safe, you know?

4268
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,080
Very cozy, right?

4269
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:10,940
Oh, there's even ways you can look down.

4270
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:14,360
Oh my gosh.

4271
03:02:14,420 --> 03:02:15,000
A castle.

4272
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:17,640
Oh, I can see people from here.

4273
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:21,340
Oh, they're just little ants from all the way up here.

4274
03:02:23,880 --> 03:02:26,120
Yeah, they're just little ants.

4275
03:02:26,420 --> 03:02:27,320
Ant people.

4276
03:02:30,460 --> 03:02:32,280
We're going to pass over the tape here.

4277
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:33,940
Oh.

4278
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:37,080
Oh, it's shuffling.

4279
03:02:38,220 --> 03:02:40,100
Is this what Tokyo Disney is like?

4280
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:44,040
Oh my gosh, there they are.

4281
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:46,020
There's one.

4282
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:46,900
There's an animal.

4283
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:50,480
Wow.

4284
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:55,800
Wow.

4285
03:02:56,200 --> 03:02:56,640
Where'd he go?

4286
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:59,340
Someone was playing with the barrel.

4287
03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:03,180
And it's taking us somewhere else.

4288
03:03:08,990 --> 03:03:12,010
When you let Highlander Academy design your zoo.

4289
03:03:15,960 --> 03:03:17,460
This feels like an ad.

4290
03:03:17,640 --> 03:03:18,440
Like ad shots.

4291
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:20,940
Hold on.

4292
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:22,380
I'm going to have a snack real quick.

4293
03:03:22,660 --> 03:03:24,160
I'm going to have a cheese okaki.

4294
03:03:29,420 --> 03:03:31,860
It's going to be a little crunchy while we watch this.

4295
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:35,280
It's broken.

4296
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:35,740
No.

4297
03:03:39,470 --> 03:03:41,830
I can see a Komodo dragon from here.

4298
03:04:03,220 --> 03:04:03,620
Wait.

4299
03:04:05,540 --> 03:04:07,160
Aren't we nearing the end?

4300
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:32,760
Stop the test.

4301
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:40,980
The dramatic shot of it falling off the cliff.

4302
03:04:45,910 --> 03:04:46,910
Wow.

4303
03:04:47,950 --> 03:04:49,350
Worth every penny.

4304
03:04:51,850 --> 03:04:53,970
We can get this one working.

4305
03:04:55,930 --> 03:04:56,930
Test.

4306
03:05:01,350 --> 03:05:02,690
Here we go.

4307
03:05:08,890 --> 03:05:11,430
Wow, it's so beautiful.

4308
03:05:13,210 --> 03:05:14,130
Wow.

4309
03:05:15,530 --> 03:05:19,030
How do I change... Max speed is zero miles per hour.

4310
03:05:20,750 --> 03:05:22,110
How do I make it faster?

4311
03:05:24,750 --> 03:05:25,330
Let's see.

4312
03:05:25,430 --> 03:05:25,770
Hold on.

4313
03:05:31,550 --> 03:05:32,350
Oh, wow.

4314
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:34,150
You can get really... Oh, wow.

4315
03:05:34,270 --> 03:05:35,190
You can get really...

4316
03:05:35,190 --> 03:05:36,590
Wait, we can do that to here then.

4317
03:05:36,730 --> 03:05:37,110
No?

4318
03:05:38,370 --> 03:05:41,050
And then that should make it able to be closed.

4319
03:05:41,570 --> 03:05:42,130
Let's see.

4320
03:05:44,490 --> 03:05:45,050
Uh-oh.

4321
03:05:46,930 --> 03:05:47,510
Okay, okay, okay.

4322
03:05:49,170 --> 03:05:50,350
Let's like do right there.

4323
03:05:51,130 --> 03:05:51,590
Okay.

4324
03:05:51,910 --> 03:05:52,610
Nice, nice, nice.

4325
03:05:52,830 --> 03:05:52,950
Okay.

4326
03:05:53,890 --> 03:05:54,350
Now...

4327
03:05:57,330 --> 03:05:58,250
Now... Now...

4328
03:05:58,250 --> 03:05:59,470
Auto-complete.

4329
03:06:02,270 --> 03:06:04,210
How do I...

4330
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:05,890
Come here.

4331
03:06:07,790 --> 03:06:08,910
How do I do it?

4332
03:06:09,170 --> 03:06:09,510
Oh, shoot.

4333
03:06:12,670 --> 03:06:16,490
We just need to suggest the big gondola for all the angry patrons.

4334
03:06:17,210 --> 03:06:18,330
What a thrill!

4335
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:23,340
Shuttle mode.

4336
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:23,800
Oh!

4337
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:24,400
Oh!

4338
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:25,960
Here we can change the max speed.

4339
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:30,240
20 miles per hour, baby.

4340
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:30,840
This one too.

4341
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:32,060
Fast.

4342
03:06:32,740 --> 03:06:33,480
How do I...

4343
03:06:33,480 --> 03:06:35,820
I think it was...

4344
03:06:35,820 --> 03:06:36,860
Edit track.

4345
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:37,320
There we go.

4346
03:06:37,540 --> 03:06:37,660
Okay.

4347
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:39,120
Auto-complete.

4348
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:40,740
Oh!

4349
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:41,880
It worked!

4350
03:06:45,130 --> 03:06:46,210
It worked!

4351
03:06:52,330 --> 03:06:53,470
Oh my gosh.

4352
03:06:53,630 --> 03:06:54,890
The best gondola ever!

4353
03:06:58,810 --> 03:07:00,850
Still seems kind of slow.

4354
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:02,950
What about this one?

4355
03:07:03,350 --> 03:07:04,490
We max the speed?

4356
03:07:05,530 --> 03:07:07,230
Let's max the thrill.

4357
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:10,610
Start the test.

4358
03:07:13,070 --> 03:07:13,790
Let's...

4359
03:07:13,790 --> 03:07:13,870
Let's see.

4360
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,550
Pull...

4361
03:07:23,730 --> 03:07:24,450
Pull...

4362
03:07:27,310 --> 03:07:28,030
Pull...

4363
03:07:31,340 --> 03:07:32,060
Pull...

4364
03:07:34,060 --> 03:07:35,440
Max speed...

4365
03:07:35,440 --> 03:07:36,480
20 miles per hour...

4366
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:36,560
Oh!

4367
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:37,560
Stop the test.

4368
03:07:38,240 --> 03:07:39,380
Get me off this ride.

4369
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:43,320
Nice.

4370
03:07:47,480 --> 03:07:50,180
That was intense, wasn't it?

4371
03:07:50,880 --> 03:07:52,560
That was pretty crazy.

4372
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:53,880
How are you guys doing?

4373
03:07:54,060 --> 03:07:54,480
Are you happy?

4374
03:07:55,380 --> 03:07:58,120
Your nutrition has moderate issues.

4375
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:00,400
Last...

4376
03:08:00,400 --> 03:08:01,860
Meal quality.

4377
03:08:05,170 --> 03:08:07,890
My last meal tasted horrible.

4378
03:08:09,070 --> 03:08:11,030
I would like to complain about it.

4379
03:08:13,430 --> 03:08:15,930
His last meal quality was also terrible.

4380
03:08:17,930 --> 03:08:19,850
Oh my god, there's so much talking there.

4381
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:21,510
Shut up, people.

4382
03:08:22,730 --> 03:08:23,790
What's going on there?

4383
03:08:31,660 --> 03:08:32,920
What's going on there?

4384
03:08:47,970 --> 03:08:48,630
Give birth...

4385
03:08:48,630 --> 03:08:49,550
Are those your babies?

4386
03:08:50,290 --> 03:08:50,770
What?

4387
03:08:53,130 --> 03:08:54,410
Don't suck up the baby!

4388
03:08:56,610 --> 03:08:58,110
Wait, you're about to give birth?

4389
03:09:10,970 --> 03:09:11,450
Oh...

4390
03:09:11,450 --> 03:09:12,830
So...

4391
03:09:12,830 --> 03:09:13,890
Cute!

4392
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:21,560
I got the miracle of life.

4393
03:09:23,460 --> 03:09:25,040
So cute!

4394
03:09:28,120 --> 03:09:30,200
Oh, a little dyslexic.

4395
03:09:31,460 --> 03:09:31,800
Oh!

4396
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:34,540
No, I'll name you.

4397
03:09:35,980 --> 03:09:37,840
I wanna name you.

4398
03:09:38,940 --> 03:09:40,300
How do I name you?

4399
03:09:41,440 --> 03:09:42,140
Well...

4400
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:44,200
Don't worry about it.

4401
03:09:46,340 --> 03:09:48,780
Oh my god, so stinking cute.

4402
03:09:49,380 --> 03:09:49,680
Oh!

4403
03:09:49,860 --> 03:09:50,540
He's excited.

4404
03:09:51,100 --> 03:09:51,940
I'm a dad!

4405
03:09:52,460 --> 03:09:53,640
I'm a dad!

4406
03:09:56,480 --> 03:09:57,960
Yeah, you are.

4407
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:01,240
Guys...

4408
03:10:01,240 --> 03:10:04,000
I think that was a good place to end today on.

4409
03:10:05,160 --> 03:10:06,240
We watched...

4410
03:10:06,240 --> 03:10:06,500
We watched...

4411
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:07,700
The miracle of life.

4412
03:10:09,140 --> 03:10:09,860
We...

4413
03:10:09,860 --> 03:10:11,360
Created this...

4414
03:10:11,360 --> 03:10:12,220
Epic...

4415
03:10:12,220 --> 03:10:12,980
Gondola...

4416
03:10:12,980 --> 03:10:13,600
Oh, it's still going.

4417
03:10:14,820 --> 03:10:16,220
Wait, I wanna ride it.

4418
03:10:16,320 --> 03:10:16,880
Ride the gondola.

4419
03:10:24,890 --> 03:10:26,350
The joy of creation.

4420
03:10:26,970 --> 03:10:28,210
In not just...

4421
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:29,750
Animals.

4422
03:10:30,330 --> 03:10:31,870
But also...

4423
03:10:31,870 --> 03:10:32,710
Gondolas.

4424
03:10:35,630 --> 03:10:37,390
Thank you for chill streaming though.

4425
03:10:37,570 --> 03:10:38,510
Thank you guys!

4426
03:10:39,190 --> 03:10:40,010
Thank you, thank you!

4427
03:10:40,590 --> 03:10:41,830
This was fun.

4428
03:10:42,570 --> 03:10:43,710
And um...

4429
03:10:44,310 --> 03:10:47,650
The max speed got to 23 miles per hour!

4430
03:10:47,910 --> 03:10:48,450
Wait...

4431
03:10:48,450 --> 03:10:49,710
If we do a drop...

4432
03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:55,390
Wait...

4433
03:10:55,390 --> 03:10:56,650
So if we have the...

4434
03:10:56,650 --> 03:10:57,710
There be a drop...

4435
03:10:57,710 --> 03:11:00,590
Would it go even faster?

4436
03:11:04,790 --> 03:11:05,830
There's our...

4437
03:11:05,830 --> 03:11:07,950
There's our magnificent, beautiful...

4438
03:11:07,950 --> 03:11:08,770
Little zoo.

4439
03:11:10,010 --> 03:11:11,530
But it's not little.

4440
03:11:11,970 --> 03:11:12,990
It's got...

4441
03:11:12,990 --> 03:11:13,970
A big heart.

4442
03:11:15,810 --> 03:11:17,950
It's got a big ol' heart.

4443
03:11:18,790 --> 03:11:19,770
Our zoo.

4444
03:11:20,850 --> 03:11:22,210
Into the lizard pit.

4445
03:11:23,150 --> 03:11:25,020
Final destination gondola.

4446
03:11:29,770 --> 03:11:31,190
This was fun, you guys!

4447
03:11:31,370 --> 03:11:32,410
Thank you so much for...

4448
03:11:32,410 --> 03:11:33,210
Um...

4449
03:11:33,210 --> 03:11:34,390
Just hanging out with me.

4450
03:11:34,670 --> 03:11:36,570
And letting me build my little zoo.

4451
03:11:36,830 --> 03:11:37,970
While I had tummy ache.

4452
03:11:38,370 --> 03:11:38,970
And um...

4453
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:43,690
It's gonna be a little bit before my next stream.

4454
03:11:45,310 --> 03:11:45,910
Um...

4455
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:46,910
So...

4456
03:11:46,910 --> 03:11:48,230
I'm sorry.

4457
03:11:49,050 --> 03:11:51,310
But I'll see you guys...

4458
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:52,170
Uh...

4459
03:11:52,170 --> 03:11:53,130
Soon it'll be...

4460
03:11:53,130 --> 03:11:53,670
It'll be...

4461
03:11:53,670 --> 03:11:55,110
It'll come fast.

4462
03:11:55,110 --> 03:11:55,310
Unless...

4463
03:11:55,310 --> 03:11:57,130
Unless I see you at off-kai.

4464
03:11:57,230 --> 03:11:58,270
Then I'll see you at off-kai.

4465
03:11:58,730 --> 03:11:59,690
I have panels.

4466
03:12:00,050 --> 03:12:01,130
And a meet and greet.

4467
03:12:01,950 --> 03:12:02,390
And...

4468
03:12:03,730 --> 03:12:04,610
And uh...

4469
03:12:05,590 --> 03:12:06,030
And...

4470
03:12:06,030 --> 03:12:06,590
Uh...

4471
03:12:06,590 --> 03:12:07,390
Yeah, that's about it.

4472
03:12:08,710 --> 03:12:09,590
Three panels!

4473
03:12:11,330 --> 03:12:11,770
Yeah.

4474
03:12:12,010 --> 03:12:12,810
And a meet and greet.

4475
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:18,090
Super fun and chill stream.

4476
03:12:18,330 --> 03:12:19,010
Thank you!

4477
03:12:19,630 --> 03:12:20,610
See you at off-kai minto.

4478
03:12:20,850 --> 03:12:21,210
See you!

4479
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:22,350
Thank you!

4480
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:24,850
Really nice stream today, huh?

4481
03:12:24,930 --> 03:12:25,970
For the off-kai in Japan.

4482
03:12:26,150 --> 03:12:26,770
Thank you!

4483
03:12:28,750 --> 03:12:29,330
Thank you!

4484
03:12:29,410 --> 03:12:29,610
Thank you!

4485
03:12:29,710 --> 03:12:30,050
Thank you!

4486
03:12:30,050 --> 03:12:30,070
Thank you!

4487
03:12:30,450 --> 03:12:31,470
What is a...

4488
03:12:31,470 --> 03:12:32,550
Spit and greet?

4489
03:12:32,770 --> 03:12:33,530
You'll just...

4490
03:12:33,530 --> 03:12:35,650
Have to...

4491
03:12:36,190 --> 03:12:36,650
See!

4492
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:40,850
Thank you so much for the off-kai-zuma!

4493
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:42,870
Good luck with your work again in Japan!

4494
03:12:43,090 --> 03:12:43,710
Thank you!

4495
03:12:45,530 --> 03:12:46,150
Thank you!

4496
03:12:46,250 --> 03:12:46,650
Thank you!

4497
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:48,730
My work...

4498
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:51,810
I'll be...

4499
03:12:51,810 --> 03:12:53,190
I'll be less busy...

4500
03:12:53,190 --> 03:12:53,930
Soon!

4501
03:12:54,650 --> 03:12:55,130
TM!

4502
03:12:56,910 --> 03:12:57,830
Soon, TM!

4503
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:00,170
Okay!

4504
03:13:00,810 --> 03:13:01,470
Thank you guys!

4505
03:13:02,130 --> 03:13:03,610
Have a good day, have a good night!

4506
03:13:03,870 --> 03:13:05,610
And I'll see you when I see you next!

4507
03:13:06,570 --> 03:13:06,910
Yeah!

4508
03:13:09,430 --> 03:13:10,290
Bye-bye!

4509
03:13:12,710 --> 03:13:15,390
It's gonna be so sad that I can't stream for a bit.

4510
03:13:15,630 --> 03:13:17,150
And then I won't have the 24 hour.

4511
03:13:17,410 --> 03:13:17,850
But...

4512
03:13:17,850 --> 03:13:20,650
As soon as I'm settled in Japan, I will stream.

4513
03:13:23,030 --> 03:13:23,670
Hmm...

4514
03:13:23,670 --> 03:13:24,290
So...

4515
03:13:24,290 --> 03:13:25,450
Don't you worry!

4516
03:13:32,850 --> 03:13:33,490
Otsumito!

4517
03:13:34,490 --> 03:13:35,130
Otsumito!

4518
03:13:35,490 --> 03:13:35,770
Arigato!

4519
03:13:35,930 --> 03:13:36,270
Arigato!

4520
03:13:36,470 --> 03:13:37,110
Chuuu!

4521
03:13:37,390 --> 03:13:38,510
Thank you, Kava!

4522
03:13:39,190 --> 03:13:41,110
