1
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,440
Why is it so scary?

2
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Welcome back, master and lady.

3
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,620
Hello everybody!

4
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,120
Welcome to Doom 64.

5
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,920
Which I think I'm like...

6
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
There's like no place for me to be.

7
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,880
I have to create my own Doomguy head.

8
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,700
In the middle of the screen.

9
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,760
You feeling better?

10
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,460
Actually, I'm feeling like absolute doo-doo today.

11
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,060
I'm feeling quite bad.

12
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,860
But that's okay.

13
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,540
We'll see how far we can get before I'm like, I can't go any longer.

14
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,860
So... no worries.

15
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,660
Interesting choice of words.

16
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,020
What?

17
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,500
You want me to say I feel like shit?

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,580
There.

19
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,720
But yeah, playing Doom 64.

20
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,580
Long, long, long, long, long time ago I played Doom 1.

21
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,260
Those VODs are privated though, sorry.

22
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,840
And...

23
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,680
And...

24
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,180
We Wisps are into doo-doo and stuff.

25
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,320
I don't... don't say that.

26
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,220
Don't say that!

27
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,160
What do you mean?

28
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,800
And... I have played Doom 2 before.

29
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,700
So I was just like, I could go into Doom 3.

30
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,280
Or before Doom 3, I could play Doom 64.

31
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,780
Right?

32
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,060
So...

33
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,680
He does not speak for me.

34
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,140
Sure.

35
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,920
Sure, I get it.

36
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,480
I get it.

37
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,180
Who's we?

38
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,640
Hello, Mint Phantom.

39
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,000
Hello.

40
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,540
He speaks only for himself.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
If you're feeling doo-doo today, then you might want to take your feet out from there.

42
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,060
Huh?

43
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
Might want to take your feet out from there.

44
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,700
Hope you feel better soon though.

45
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,420
Thank you.

46
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,260
Hmm?

47
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,250
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,890
Kiss.

49
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:37,970
Toot.

50
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,830
Toot!

51
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,490
Membership.

52
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,790
Minto added tax.

53
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,150
Stop!

54
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,470
There's no added tax.

55
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,230
But thank you.

56
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,970
Can't wait to hear the screams.

57
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,530
Yeah!

58
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,130
When I was six, I rented this at the store.

59
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,650
Got scared by a pinky and my mom wouldn't let me get rated M games anymore.

60
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,910
Get revenge for me, Mint.

61
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,690
I will.

62
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,290
I'll get revenge for you.

63
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,050
Let's see.

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,430
This is already so spooky, right?

65
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,850
Andragos, thanks for the 10 gifted.

66
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,950
Dogstrings, thanks for the 10 gifted.

67
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,990
Thank you guys so much.

68
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,310
But yeah, I don't feel so well today, so take it easy on me.

69
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,270
We're going to take it easy a little bit as well.

70
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:27,450
I still, I'm recovering from the big C and jet lag all at the same time.

71
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,710
My mom was just like, hey, can I, can, like, I want to meet up.

72
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,410
But she wanted me to tell her.

73
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,230
She wanted me to test again before I met up with her.

74
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,530
Notorious!

75
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,550
Thanks for the gifted.

76
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:50,030
And I, I tested two days ago and I was negative, but I think it was a false negative because I tested again two times this morning.

77
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,650
I had COVID still.

78
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,090
Wee!

79
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,150
So I was like, no way.

80
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,970
It's okay, though.

81
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,970
Mm-hmm.

82
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,310
The big C is what Kiara is serving.

83
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:06,850
Absolutely.

84
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,630
But I feel okay for the most part.

85
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:21,430
Just, just sometimes my head, I had a really, really, really bad migraine yesterday.

86
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,810
So it's a good thing I didn't stream.

87
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,310
But sometimes I get a little dizzy and sometimes I feel like I'm going to throw up a little bit.

88
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,030
And...

89
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,890
And my nose is a little stuffed.

90
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,410
But other than that, I'm all good.

91
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,950
So my dad played this as a child, but I was always too scared to play myself.

92
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,410
Get revenge for me, too.

93
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,210
I hope you get well soon.

94
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:46,830
I miss you lots.

95
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,410
Thank you.

96
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,570
You know what?

97
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,390
This, this feels like a game my dad...

98
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,630
Today's Father's Day, isn't it?

99
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,710
This feels like a game my dad would have liked.

100
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,210
But my dad was really into Diablo and Neverwinter Nights.

101
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,610
And I remember gifting him...

102
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,590
Oh, gosh.

103
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,430
There was like...

104
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,010
It was made by this dude.

105
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,790
Diablo People.

106
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,790
I can't remember the name of it, though.

107
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,970
But yeah.

108
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,350
If you celebrate Father's Day, happy Father's Day.

109
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,270
I can be your dad, too.

110
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,970
Oh, Torchlight.

111
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,870
Yes, yes, yes.

112
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,390
Torchlight, Torchlight, Torchlight.

113
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,230
Yeah.

114
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,910
My dad, he also played...

115
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,930
There were some...

116
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,830
I don't think it was Call of Duty, but there were some FPS stuff that he did.

117
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,590
But he never...

118
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,830
I never saw him play Doom.

119
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,130
Not that I can remember.

120
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:33,990
I don't know.

121
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,810
But yeah.

122
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,890
And he liked Age of Empires and stuff like that.

123
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,830
One of my favorite Doom-like games are Turok games.

124
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,530
Maybe in the future for a filler game especially, too.

125
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,310
Have fun, Mint.

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,910
Hope you feel better.

127
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,430
Thank you.

128
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,570
Yeah.

129
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,650
I saw some people in the pre-chat asking about Quake and stuff like that.

130
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,850
Totally not off the table.

131
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,410
Just eventually, whenever I get to it, whenever I feel like it.

132
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,130
Hi, Dad.

133
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,570
Hello, son.

134
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,630
And or daughter.

135
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,430
Hello, child.

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,010
Hello, my spawn.

137
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,770
Anyway.

138
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,410
New game.

139
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,110
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

140
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,690
Be gentle.

141
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,790
Bring it on.

142
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,250
I own Doom.

143
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,630
Watch me die!

144
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,490
What are these?

145
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,930
Dad!

146
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,470
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

147
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,090
Thank you.

148
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,130
Don't call them spawn.

149
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh, sorry.

150
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,970
Oh, sorry.

151
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,210
Thanks for spawning me.

152
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,930
It's like instead of...

153
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,550
Where are we dropping?

154
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,090
Well, all kids dropped out of somewhere.

155
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,990
Lost in the story.

156
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,850
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,670
Thank you.

158
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,690
So bring it on, would that be normal?

159
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,870
Or I own Doom, is that one normal?

160
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,890
What you do?

161
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,290
Do mods.

162
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,790
Oh, I'm not opposed to it.

163
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,050
I'm not opposed to it.

164
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,430
Sorry.

165
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,250
Time to die.

166
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,830
It's hard mode.

167
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,950
I own Doom as normal.

168
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,950
Bring it on seems like normal.

169
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,410
Okay, we'll do bring it on.

170
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,430
Just like the movie.

171
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,150
Bring it on is normal.

172
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,290
Oh, it's already so spooky.

173
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,590
Why does that look like a trap right there?

174
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,390
What's the music?

175
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm scared.

176
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,950
Wait, I'm scared.

177
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,290
I'm the gun.

178
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,430
Oh, wait.

179
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,030
Hold on.

180
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,070
Maybe I should move myself.

181
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,170
Where can I go?

182
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,290
I'll move right here.

183
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,650
That way you can still see stuff.

184
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,070
But I'm still a little Doom guy head.

185
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,190
Someone got to come out of there?

186
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,510
Beep boop.

187
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,690
I don't want to shoot just to shoot, but...

188
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,950
I know if I go down here...

189
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,390
Ugh.

190
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,210
Oh, I already got the shotgun.

191
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,210
Okay.

192
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,510
I thought it was going to be a trap for sure.

193
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,630
You see that right there?

194
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,050
It's probably one of my friends.

195
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,570
Not

196
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,440
my friends.

197
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,120
Oh, this is just health.

198
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
Why is it so scary?

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,820
Shoots the friend instantly.

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
Hold on one second.

201
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,180
I got to fix my screen.

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,520
There we go.

203
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,980
One of the big things that separates this from lots of classic Doom is the soundtrack being more horror than heavy metal.

204
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,700
It's very atmospheric.

205
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm already getting that vibe.

206
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,360
Is this a door?

207
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,760
No.

208
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,980
Oh, friends.

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,240
Oh.

210
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,400
Thank you.

211
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,660
Thank you.

212
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,420
Chew.

213
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,980
What's this?

214
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,820
Is this a door?

215
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm guessing space is to open doors, right?

216
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,100
Just like before?

217
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,260
Wait.

218
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,780
How do I actually open the doors?

219
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,180
Sorry.

220
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,280
I did not set up for a stream at all.

221
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,080
Thanks for being our dad.

222
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,520
Of course.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh.

224
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,840
No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,180
Eee.

226
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,640
Oh, eee.

227
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,140
Okay.

228
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,040
So let me go back to this.

229
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,210
This is actually so spooky.

230
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,750
What is this?

231
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,470
Oh, box of bullets.

232
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:43,810
Nice.

233
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,130
I'll take that.

234
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,290
Oh my god.

235
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,870
Oh, it's moving.

236
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,650
I can move with it.

237
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,130
That's so fun.

238
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,250
Oh, I'm moving.

239
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,210
Wow.

240
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,310
That's so cool.

241
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,630
I can't get your bullets.

242
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,390
Nice.

243
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,470
What is...

244
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,530
Do you think I need to do anything with this?

245
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,590
Oh.

246
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,510
Oh my gosh.

247
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,190
It really did work.

248
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,650
Oh, wow.

249
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,090
I think I'm a genius.

250
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,110
Oh.

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,090
I got a chainsaw.

252
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,490
Wait.

253
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,110
There was other stuff.

254
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,930
No.

255
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,710
These are just lights.

256
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,710
Okay.

257
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:43,990
Well...

258
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,350
Oh.

259
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,930
Look at my fist.

260
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,470
I'll go back to the...

261
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,710
Oh, never mind.

262
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,630
I cannot go back to the shotgun.

263
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,870
Okay.

264
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,530
That's a little sad.

265
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,850
That's fine, though.

266
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,790
I'll pack a chainsaw.

267
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,190
I'll skin your ass raw.

268
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,880
They're much pinker in this game.

269
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,840
Shotgun is three.

270
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,140
Oh, thank you.

271
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,300
Not that I don't mind the chainsaw, but the sound of it is a little much, you know?

272
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Oh, there's the blue key.

273
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,500
Okay.

274
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,820
Nice.

275
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,680
Oh.

276
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,140
Oh.

277
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,520
Oh.

278
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:41,860
Oh.

279
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,440
Oh.

280
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,220
Oh.

281
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,500
Oh.

282
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,640
I have reflexes.

283
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,740
I like a cat.

284
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm picking up stuff first.

285
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:55,940
Okay.

286
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,560
Never mind.

287
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,380
E.

288
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,360
Oh.

289
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,430
What is that?

290
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,610
What did I just open?

291
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,030
Uh-oh.

292
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,750
What did I just unleash?

293
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,480
Let's see.

294
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,980
The sky is so beautiful.

295
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,720
I hate the moon.

296
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay.

297
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,440
Let's go.

298
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,140
Yeah.

299
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,540
I don't know what I just unleashed.

300
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm scared.

301
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,400
Anybody else in here ready for a...

302
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,360
Oh.

303
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,120
I hear him.

304
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,480
I hear him.

305
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:49,880
I hear him.

306
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,640
Somewhere.

307
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,080
I mean, where am I?

308
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,400
Oh, I hear him.

309
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,830
Oh, come on.

310
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,950
I know I'm shotgunning or I'm sniping with a shotgun, but you know, whatever.

311
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,810
What is this?

312
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,310
What is this?

313
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,910
Maybe it's more health.

314
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,990
It smells minty here.

315
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,410
This is so spooky.

316
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,850
Hope that you start feeling better.

317
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,650
Xen, I get a happy birthday.

318
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,850
Xen, happy birthday.

319
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,750
Singing is not necessary.

320
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,490
Happy birthday.

321
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,130
Happy birthday.

322
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,250
Happy birthday to you.

323
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,910
Happy birthday to you.

324
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,230
Happy birthday to you.

325
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,370
assessments.

326
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:33,590
Oh my God.

327
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,810
Dharma Michelle.

328
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,570
birthday20 is sad.

329
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,970
Oh, my God.

330
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,350
Happy birthday to you!

331
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,110
Everything's fine, probably.

332
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,430
Do those explode?

333
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:57,810
Okay.

334
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,090
They do run away.

335
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,510
I do explode.

336
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,470
Good to know.

337
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,700
Freak phantom is about to freak some demons.

338
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,940
Oh, there we go.

339
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,460
Okay...

340
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,400
Oh, do I have to be fast?

341
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,380
Okay, I have to be fast.

342
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,240
Wait a second.

343
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,440
Did I go in here?

344
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,800
Is this new?

345
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,340
Ah!

346
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,300
I think it's new.

347
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,580
Uh-oh.

348
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,800
I heard something big.

349
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,220
Something powerful.

350
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,460
Yellow room... with a pancake.

351
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Gotta go fast.

352
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,000
Chat, is this modded?

353
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,520
It is...

354
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,660
Oh, we're at the very beginning!

355
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,120
It is not modded.

356
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,140
What is that sound?

357
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,440
Oh!

358
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,640
There's a lot more Piggies in here than I thought there would be!

359
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,180
Oh my god.

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
They can open the door themselves?

361
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,200
Why are you so intelligent?

362
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,340
That's the BGM?

363
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,060
No way.

364
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,500
That was wet.

365
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,200
This is such...

366
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,180
Wowee!

367
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,180
Armor bonus, baby!

368
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,300
The door is squished.

369
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,060
Oh!

370
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,640
Oh, gross!

371
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,480
Wait.

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,120
That's nasty.

373
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,480
Oh!

374
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,140
What is that?

375
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,640
Oh no, wait.

376
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, wait.

377
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,720
Is that the real exit?

378
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,700
This is the exit.

379
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

380
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,000
There was another area.

381
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,360
I'm not quite yet ready.

382
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,820
Yeti.

383
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Ah!

384
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,100
Ah!

385
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,060
Oh!

386
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,460
Um...

387
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,000
I think I found a hidden...

388
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,180
Nice.

389
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,500
I don't know how I found that.

390
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,360
Blueberry!

391
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,780
Wait, where do I get that?

392
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
It's showing me...

393
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,420
It's showing me the secret location of a blueberry.

394
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,740
But I don't know how to get it.

395
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,020
What the heck is this game?

396
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,400
There's so much more to explore.

397
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,680
Is it this?

398
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,340
Is this the blueberry?

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
This must be it.

400
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,500
Berserk!

401
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,620
Um...

402
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,340
Hm?

403
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:17,890
Anyway...

404
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,170
Nice exploring.

405
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:19,810
Thanks!

406
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,630
Though...

407
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,650
I don't...

408
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,050
Maybe I guess we just leave.

409
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,390
I do want the blueberry, but...

410
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,690
I guess it's fine.

411
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,070
I don't have to get all the secrets.

412
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,670
And this is kind of easy to get lost here.

413
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,930
I think, maybe.

414
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,290
Where could he be?

415
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,290
Hmm...

416
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,550
You're very close to the blueberry.

417
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,650
Dang!

418
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,310
Ah!

419
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,190
So close.

420
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,370
Zero secrets.

421
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,420
Password?

422
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,400
Entering the terraformer.

423
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,610
No blueberry.

424
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,230
Next time, we'll get him.

425
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,600
Shoot him!

426
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,600
Shoot him when they're not expecting it.

427
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:24,960
Oh!

428
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,300
That is an imp, right?

429
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,060
I'm assuming...

430
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
Is that his butthole?

431
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,400
It's gaping.

432
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,100
It's...

433
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,700
Wow!

434
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,700
Or that's where...

435
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,880
Maybe that's where I shot him.

436
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,320
No!

437
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,520
I think that's his butthole.

438
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,580
Passwords are for area without save.

439
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Hmm...

440
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,900
Do you guys see it?

441
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,040
I don't know.

442
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,640
Or is it just me?

443
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,420
Look!

444
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,620
Look!

445
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,860
Look!

446
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,040
Look!

447
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,180
Look!

448
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,190
He's got a gaping hole.

449
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,150
Can I check these?

450
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,570
No.

451
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,810
What the...

452
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,330
The numbers.

453
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,110
What do they mean?

454
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,490
Oh, I need a yellow key.

455
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,950
Oh...

456
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,390
Well...

457
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,850
I...

458
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,070
Oh!

459
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,450
Door.

460
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,750
Oh!

461
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,170
Oh!

462
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,310
Are you kidding me right now?

463
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,930
Um...

464
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,530
There must be...

465
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,970
There must be another door somewhere else.

466
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,020
What's that sound?

467
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,640
Can I go through this hole?

468
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,100
Reminds me of laser tag.

469
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,100
Oh my gosh!

470
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm...

471
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I'm so terrified though!

472
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,280
Eek!

473
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,560
It's dark!

474
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,360
It's so dark!

475
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,700
Lights.

476
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,880
Oh, thank goodness.

477
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,920
Whoa!

478
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,240
Whoa!

479
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,120
Uh-oh.

480
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,760
I got the mega armor and I unleashed some other people.

481
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,680
Okay.

482
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,740
We have several things that have happened here now.

483
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,340
Oh!

484
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Like that.

485
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
Need a blue key.

486
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,080
Okay.

487
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,760
Makes sense.

488
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,380
Blueberry!

489
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,020
Blueberry spotted.

490
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,280
Ah!

491
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,600
This game is so whack!

492
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,340
Uh-oh.

493
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,440
All of these are gonna open, aren't they?

494
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,220
Oh, God.

495
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh, God.

496
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:39,980
Oh, God.

497
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,180
Oh, God.

498
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,420
Oh, God.

499
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,640
Oh, God.

500
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,180
Oh, God.

501
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,520
Oh, God.

502
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,780
Who's snoring?

503
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,220
What just happened?

504
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,880
My health didn't go down.

505
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,560
Oh!

506
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:57,960
Oh!

507
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,460
Oh!

508
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,560
That's a different...

509
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,860
That looks like a chain...

510
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,160
Not the chain gunner.

511
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,640
A gun.

512
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,800
Oh my gosh.

513
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Machine gun over there?

514
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,140
Maybe.

515
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,300
There's a zombie above me?

516
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,260
If I shoot...

517
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,360
Dummy.

518
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm gonna...

519
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,600
Oh, there's another one.

520
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,040
Oh!

521
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,490
Okay.

522
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,010
Here we go.

523
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,220
I was prepared.

524
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,100
I was prepared.

525
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh my God.

526
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,280
Don't shoot me.

527
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,860
Oh my God.

528
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,040
Can I get him?

529
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,920
Come back over here.

530
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
Come back over here, stinky.

531
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,940
I can hear you.

532
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,020
I can hear your mouth breathing.

533
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,800
There we go.

534
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,560
That's what I love about Doom.

535
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,560
You barely have to aim.

536
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,260
Oh!

537
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,860
We're back to normal.

538
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,620
Okay.

539
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,260
Oh!

540
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,820
So, how do I get to the chain?

541
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm...

542
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:22,900
Oh!

543
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,200
Okay.

544
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,920
That's chainsaw.

545
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Is it four?

546
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,120
Yes.

547
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,460
Okay.

548
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,380
No aim required.

549
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,560
Just a little bit of aim required.

550
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,620
I don't want to say no aim.

551
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,160
Tiny, limited aim required.

552
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,640
You know?

553
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,660
What's over here?

554
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,800
Have I gone in?

555
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,100
No.

556
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,820
I have not gone in.

557
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,040
Oh, there's the blue key.

558
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,420
It looks like a trap.

559
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,820
It looks like a trap to me.

560
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,860
It looks like...

561
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,300
Look at that.

562
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
They give you literally everything you need.

563
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,860
They're like, you need more armor.

564
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,200
You need more ammo.

565
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,260
They're like, you need more armor.

566
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,080
You need everything.

567
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
You sad, sad.

568
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,420
We'll come back in here.

569
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:04,900
Hold on.

570
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,760
Oh, gosh.

571
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,120
Where's the blue room?

572
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,740
Okay.

573
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,120
This is...

574
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,320
Okay.

575
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,580
Okay.

576
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,760
Okay.

577
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,660
I know where we are.

578
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
So, here...

579
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,700
It's the blue berry.

580
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,860
Is this a staircase?

581
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,320
Yeah.

582
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,620
What is this?

583
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,260
Goggles?

584
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,700
Light amplification goggles.

585
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,340
Oh!

586
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,840
Okay.

587
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,920
I'll take that.

588
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,260
Okay.

589
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
The blue berry is right there, you guys.

590
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,980
Taunting me.

591
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,100
Look at that.

592
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,080
No.

593
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
The mood lighting.

594
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh, sorry.

595
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,800
Wow.

596
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,140
This game looks so crazy.

597
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,400
Oh, shoot.

598
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,340
I went berserk again.

599
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,620
I went berserk mode.

600
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,080
Hmm.

601
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,000
Here.

602
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,140
Punch the wall.

603
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,940
Punch the wall.

604
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,680
Punch the wall.

605
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,180
Punch the wall.

606
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,400
Punch the wall.

607
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,820
Red key.

608
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,220
I could have told you that.

609
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,220
The punches are so funny.

610
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,880
I know, right?

611
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,400
Interesting.

612
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay.

613
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, the mood lighting really did just...

614
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,920
Oh, this is the blue key.

615
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,220
That's right.

616
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay.

617
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,860
I can't even see how far it could go.

618
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,800
Which is over in here.

619
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,580
Alright, let's go into this trap.

620
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,640
Let's fall for it, like the suckers we are, little saps.

621
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,180
What the...

622
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,300
Oy!

623
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Oy!

624
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,500
Oh.

625
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,620
Huh?

626
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,400
There's puzzles in this game now, too?

627
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,620
I'm too small.

628
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm too small.

629
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Do you remember what I used to do?

630
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,180
Please!

631
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,900
I don't know how to lift my arms!

632
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,360
Uh-oh.

633
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,880
Wait, those just lifted up, didn't they?

634
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,740
Those were not lifted up before.

635
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,520
Okay.

636
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,820
Interesting.

637
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,020
I don't think it's teleporting again.

638
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,820
Short ghost problems?

639
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,000
Absolutely.

640
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,540
Now we must choose...

641
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh no, my goggles!

642
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,900
What was the point of grabbing them?

643
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,180
We have four choices.

644
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,360
How spooky.

645
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,860
Four is my favorite number.

646
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,060
Doomguy Short King confirmed.

647
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,640
We love that for him.

648
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,750
Choose wisely.

649
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,690
This one is the only one without computer.

650
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,350
This one...

651
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,130
Is the...

652
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,750
Yeah, three is the least suspicious, right?

653
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,550
Shark baby!

654
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,370
Welcome to membership.

655
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:07,870
Thank you!

656
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,630
Okay.

657
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,270
Oh, nice.

658
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,870
Oh.

659
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,830
Oh.

660
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,830
Run!

661
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,460
Oh,

662
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,840
how can I make it faster?

663
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,060
Shift to run.

664
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,920
There is no shift to run.

665
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Hit caps lock.

666
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,000
Oh, wow!

667
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,260
Caps lock.

668
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,340
Oh no, I hit tab.

669
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,100
Oh my goodness.

670
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,480
I didn't realize I was walking this whole time.

671
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,660
Why can he go even faster?

672
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,610
Don't sneak up on me like that.

673
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,030
Look!

674
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,870
It's...

675
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,970
Come on.

676
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,270
Look at that hole.

677
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,550
Zoom.

678
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,630
Holy cow.

679
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,230
Wait.

680
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,810
But space doesn't make me run either.

681
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,710
So I just have to auto run or something, right?

682
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,470
I'm telling you.

683
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,090
I told you.

684
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,150
I saw it the whole time.

685
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,730
That's not for me shooting.

686
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,810
That's not for me shooting.

687
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,270
I think they're a little freaky up in here.

688
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,930
It's a little freaky here in hell is all I'm saying.

689
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,290
Okay, we gotta run through this, right?

690
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,730
Okay.

691
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,310
Now I know how to run.

692
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,470
Nice.

693
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,510
Ah!

694
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,410
Have some weird controls because it came from the N64.

695
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,270
Yeah, yeah.

696
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,930
No worries.

697
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,330
So far it's not so bad, I'd say.

698
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,810
Oh my goodness.

699
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,090
Whoa!

700
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,490
Rockets!

701
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,110
What do we need those for?

702
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,730
Uh-oh.

703
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,550
Whoa!

704
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,450
Invisible pinky!

705
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,570
Sounds like my cat snoring.

706
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,590
This is a door.

707
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,690
No, it's not.

708
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,210
We got the blueberry!

709
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,790
Yummy, yummy!

710
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,910
This is definitely a door, though.

711
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,910
This is 100% a door.

712
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,410
Thank you!

713
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,510
I think you're a little freaky.

714
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,610
Can't open it from that side.

715
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,190
Dang.

716
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,670
Okay, well, we also had down here.

717
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,250
Okay.

718
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,730
Oh, gosh.

719
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,850
The music makes me so afraid.

720
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,410
The music makes me so scared.

721
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,570
Is this a teleporter?

722
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,730
Oh!

723
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,430
Oh my God!

724
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:44,990
Oh!

725
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,230
Whoa!

726
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:45,710
Ah!

727
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,220
Oh my God!

728
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,600
Wait!

729
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:51,820
Ah!

730
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,800
I can't see anything!

731
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,960
I think I peed myself.

732
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,600
From the very beginning, y'all.

733
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,140
No!

734
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,580
I lost all my weapons!

735
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh my God!

736
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Oh my God!

737
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,280
Oh my God!

738
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,040
I lost everything!

739
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,080
No!

740
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,780
Also, it looks way darker in OBS than I realize it looks.

741
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,980
It looks way darker in OBS than...

742
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,260
Did I kill him?

743
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,720
Not yet.

744
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,200
Oh my goodness.

745
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Die.

746
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
Die already.

747
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,060
Ah, man.

748
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,720
No auto-saves.

749
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,680
No, I'm not playing through OBS.

750
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,920
I just realized.

751
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,760
Oh my God!

752
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,080
Um, I can actually see so much better than I think you guys can.

753
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,440
It's not dark on YouTube?

754
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,100
Oh, okay.

755
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,440
That's good.

756
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,200
You can save manually.

757
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,600
I forgot about this door, to be honest.

758
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,400
Oh, man.

759
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,680
I have to go through everything again.

760
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,480
And I lost my...

761
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,380
Well, I never really used the chainsaw, so I guess it's okay.

762
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,660
Oh, I forgot about this room.

763
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,540
Eek!

764
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,620
Eek!

765
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,640
Body armor.

766
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,570
And another guy.

767
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:28,530
Here!

768
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,510
Are there any other guys here?

769
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:33,870
No.

770
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,170
Grab everything.

771
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,590
I don't want to go berserk.

772
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,070
It's appropriately spooky dark.

773
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,450
I'd say so, too.

774
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,410
And we know how to get to the blueberry.

775
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,050
It's okay.

776
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,570
We lost progress, but...

777
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,590
It's okay.

778
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,770
It wasn't like... it could be where...

779
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:54,910
Oh!

780
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,830
Where the hell did you come from?

781
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,830
Okay.

782
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,730
I am...

783
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,090
I'm a different ghost now.

784
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,550
I've learned.

785
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,890
I've learned.

786
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,530
Chuu!

787
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,130
Chuu!

788
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,170
Thank you!

789
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,530
Okay.

790
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,770
That's right.

791
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,290
This one.

792
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,410
Battle hardened.

793
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,730
It's very dark on Twitch.

794
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,710
Pure black even.

795
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,150
Except for some white text that says, offline.

796
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,130
Wow.

797
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,110
Offline.

798
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:00,970
They're...

799
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,050
They're, uh...

800
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,630
They're silencing me.

801
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,850
Oh!

802
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,850
Wait, it's not going in the same order?

803
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,090
Wait.

804
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,010
Am I crazy?

805
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,570
Maybe it is going in the same order.

806
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,170
What?

807
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,410
Is this different now too?

808
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,390
Wait, is this different now also?

809
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,610
No way.

810
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,230
Huh?

811
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,850
I'm being oppressed.

812
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,090
But it's...

813
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,470
This one then.

814
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,930
Oh, shoot.

815
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,110
Where did you come from?

816
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,890
Okay, cool.

817
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,230
Okay.

818
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,760
Blue door.

819
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,080
Blue door leads to blueberry.

820
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,480
Blueberry leads to death.

821
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,280
Ah!

822
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:12,830
Okay.

823
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,730
Caps lock.

824
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,610
Okay.

825
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,290
We've been running.

826
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:16,870
Oh!

827
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,090
Whoa!

828
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,630
That was close.

829
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,050
Ah!

830
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,140
And there's two more here.

831
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
And invisible pinky.

832
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,360
Here.

833
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,400
Ah!

834
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,160
Oh my god.

835
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,340
Oh, that was close.

836
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,900
I'll turn auto run off for now.

837
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Because it stresses me out a little bit.

838
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,460
It makes me be too fast.

839
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,540
You know?

840
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,580
Too fast, too furious.

841
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,780
Oh, but what do I do about the...

842
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,160
Maybe I just shouldn't go in that area.

843
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
But I feel like I have to.

844
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,300
Otherwise, where do I go?

845
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,980
What do I do?

846
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,340
You know?

847
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,480
I don't want to go in here!

848
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,080
Hmm...

849
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,700
Otherwise, I need...

850
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,820
Hmm...

851
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,320
Can you save?

852
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,800
Oh, I can!

853
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,000
Save.

854
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,300
Bring it on!

855
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,300
How many levels are there in this game, by the way?

856
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,540
I'm just curious.

857
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,520
When I play these games nowadays, I'm like, what is wrong with the devs making it so hard?

858
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,460
Meanwhile, my goofy ass young Bagger is coming at me.

859
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,380
Then a little easy.

860
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,160
About 25 over 30.

861
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,060
There was like a teleporter over here.

862
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
Maybe we should just wait.

863
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,480
No, over here.

864
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,260
Maybe we should just take it.

865
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,000
Right.

866
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,420
This one right here.

867
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,640
Run.

868
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,520
I'm running.

869
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,220
Oh, oh, I'm back at the beginning.

870
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,340
Oh, okay.

871
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,780
I never I didn't get a key or anything like that.

872
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,780
So it's kind of... This is a red key, right?

873
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah.

874
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,160
This version also comes with a new episode.

875
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,660
No way.

876
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,080
Really?

877
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,920
Went down there.

878
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,400
I don't have a yellow key to go in there.

879
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,460
So I need keys.

880
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,680
I only have a blue key.

881
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,160
It's not any of this, right?

882
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,120
Okay.

883
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,800
Thanks, game.

884
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,660
You're so funny.

885
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,820
Okay, game.

886
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,660
You're so funny.

887
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,840
It has to be in here.

888
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh, shucks.

889
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,300
I think once I... It's this that starts it, isn't it?

890
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,780
I think.

891
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,520
Okay.

892
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,460
Oh, whoopsie.

893
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,540
I think it's that...

894
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,060
I trip that and it all starts coming down.

895
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,580
Stalling pro.

896
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
What are you talking about?

897
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,100
I'm just trying to figure out a strategy.

898
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,060
Fine, I'm gonna go.

899
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,560
I made it.

900
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,940
Oh, oh, oh.

901
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,460
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

902
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Try and hit me, stupid imp!

903
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,320
I'll blast you to pieces.

904
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,840
Am I good?

905
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,740
Oh my god, I'm not good.

906
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,140
Oh!

907
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,700
Oh my god!

908
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh no no no no!

909
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,460
Okay.

910
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,640
That was it?

911
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,420
That was it?

912
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,760
That was it?

913
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,080
That was it?

914
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,380
That was it?

915
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:22,640
Okay.

916
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,780
Red key acquired!

917
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Oh, outwards.

918
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,060
I don't like the music.

919
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,480
It scares me.

920
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,760
Okay.

921
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,360
What the hell?

922
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,580
Why didn't that kill you?

923
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,120
I was standing right there.

924
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,100
I should have one-shotted you.

925
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,420
What's going on?

926
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,860
Huh?

927
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,440
I can't leave here.

928
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,500
Oh my god.

929
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,880
Hydraulic press versus made me.

930
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,240
Oh, now I can go.

931
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,340
Okay.

932
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,760
What?

933
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,290
Are you gonna go...

934
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,710
down again?

935
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:27,870
No?

936
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,050
We're safe?

937
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,830
Maybe?

938
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,570
Safe is not maybe the best word.

939
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,090
We're... Oh, I see you.

940
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,850
I see you down there.

941
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:39,910
Okay.

942
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,250
Messed up.

943
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,070
Is he still there?

944
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,530
I don't think I can get him from here.

945
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,030
That's okay.

946
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,190
Okay.

947
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,750
Let's just go.

948
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,650
Look at them.

949
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,730
They're in their little cages.

950
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,570
But someone got free.

951
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:04,870
Okay.

952
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,950
You're stuck in there and I'm not.

953
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,090
This is so freaky.

954
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,970
Why do they have guns in jail?

955
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,870
That's a great question, actually.

956
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,910
That's actually a really good question to ask.

957
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:29,890
Oh!

958
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,890
The grand...

959
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,210
Oh, I thought...

960
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,290
I thought he was just gonna slide on down.

961
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,360
Got a shotgun.

962
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,170
Hey.

963
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,170
Oh my goodness.

964
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,730
Oh goodness.

965
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,030
From every angle!

966
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,290
Come on!

967
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,490
Oh my goodness.

968
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,110
Okay.

969
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,950
Taking out everybody one by one.

970
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,650
Slowly but surely.

971
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:12,410
This guy too.

972
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,490
There we go.

973
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:14,890
Okay.

974
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,550
Nice!

975
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,110
264fan here.

976
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:23,450
Hello!

977
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,030
Alright.

978
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,210
Let's go up here.

979
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,010
Any computers gonna tell me any secrets?

980
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,490
This game is old.

981
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,730
I mean, yeah, it is old.

982
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,910
It's for the N64, like...

983
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:44,190
Oh!

984
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,330
Goodness gracious.

985
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,110
Aye!

986
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,390
Aye!

987
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:49,890
Oh!

988
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,830
Two at once, baby!

989
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:53,810
Double kill!

990
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,010
I'm too good.

991
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,810
I'm too powerful.

992
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,250
I can't stop.

993
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,590
I can't stop.

994
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:02,790
I can't stop.

995
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:09,950
Probably.

996
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,690
Any secrets?

997
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,850
Okay, I put this down and it's gonna...

998
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,810
Am I running?

999
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,390
Okay, I'm running.

1000
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,850
Oh!

1001
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,450
Oh!

1002
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,230
Secrets.

1003
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,550
Secrets.

1004
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,230
Remember to save me, though.

1005
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,650
Aki!

1006
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,010
Yes.

1007
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,610
I turned that.

1008
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,550
So, if I go back here...

1009
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,250
Aki?

1010
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,030
Okay!

1011
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,390
I think we can get the heck out of here.

1012
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,950
Oh!

1013
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:55,950
Secret area!

1014
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,730
I got a box of rockets.

1015
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,310
What do I need...

1016
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,150
What do I need those for?

1017
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,950
What do I need those for?

1018
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,870
Any other secrets?

1019
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,390
Secret area...

1020
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,820
Nice job!

1021
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,500
Thank you!

1022
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,860
Thank you!

1023
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,400
That's my intuition.

1024
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh!

1025
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,260
This is the other side!

1026
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,380
Oh!

1027
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,380
This is the other side!

1028
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,320
I see.

1029
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,900
Isn't this...

1030
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,380
Why does this feel longer than going back this way?

1031
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,500
Doesn't really feel like a shortcut.

1032
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,780
I'd say.

1033
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,620
Are you okay?

1034
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,600
Even going down the stairs...

1035
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,580
Oh, wait!

1036
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,360
We can't get back up.

1037
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,840
Just kidding.

1038
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,420
Yeah, it's okay.

1039
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Old N64.

1040
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,760
Matt Damon aging gif.

1041
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,520
Okay.

1042
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,900
This way.

1043
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,820
What is that sound?

1044
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,400
Sounds like the spider demon.

1045
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,640
I think it's just doors closing, but...

1046
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,660
Sounds suspicious, you know.

1047
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,740
Everything escapes.

1048
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,040
Seems suspicious to me.

1049
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,000
Wait, how do we get over there?

1050
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,020
Wait, how do we get over there?

1051
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,840
Right through here!

1052
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,000
Right through here!

1053
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,300
Right through here!

1054
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,780
Oh!

1055
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:28,920
Oh!

1056
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,460
I didn't realize that was the exit.

1057
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,400
Yippee!

1058
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,680
Only 66 items!

1059
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,140
And 50% secrets.

1060
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,240
Would love to see Half-Life someday.

1061
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,740
Would love to see Half-Life someday.

1062
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:41,840
Maybe.

1063
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,680
I got the password.

1064
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,560
Do these passwords change?

1065
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,540
Or are they, like...

1066
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,640
I mean, like...

1067
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,000
Should I be saving them?

1068
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,220
Or are they written down somewhere?

1069
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,300
I remember playing this game on my brother's 1994 Mac computer.

1070
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,260
Holy cow.

1071
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,200
Write down the first password?

1072
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,480
I think I have it.

1073
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,020
Oops.

1074
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,500
I think I screenshotted it.

1075
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,220
One second.

1076
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:07,340
One second.

1077
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,780
Yeah, I screenshotted the first one.

1078
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,580
The password is only if you're not saving.

1079
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:21,920
Ah!

1080
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,580
Okay, then it doesn't really matter.

1081
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,800
Also, I'm going to do this real quick.

1082
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,820
Also, I'm going to do this real quick.

1083
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,660
I was gonna keep myself in a little box.

1084
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,080
I mean, I'm still kind of in a little box.

1085
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,220
I got a little bit more wiggle room now.

1086
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,000
I got a little bit more wiggle room now.

1087
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,400
Okay.

1088
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,520
Oh.

1089
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,240
You guys are right behind me.

1090
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,320
I was like, what's attacking me?

1091
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,360
I got a super shot!

1092
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,780
Nightmare imps.

1093
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,720
Not to be confused with, you know, normal ass imps.

1094
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,960
Which are not hellish and nightmare-ish enough, I suppose.

1095
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,600
Oh!

1096
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,080
Hm.

1097
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,740
I'm glad.

1098
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,120
Oh my goodness!

1099
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,140
Ah!

1100
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,740
Whew.

1101
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,160
He actually got me.

1102
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,060
I don't even hear them in there.

1103
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:45,800
Whoa!

1104
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,400
Wait, does this one go down?

1105
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,420
Oh, it already went down too.

1106
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,380
Cool!

1107
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,680
Which way shall we go?

1108
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,200
I guess this way.

1109
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,680
Did I miss my chance?

1110
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,200
Um.

1111
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:15,490
Oh, okay.

1112
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,510
Actually, I think it was better that I waited.

1113
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,990
Wait.

1114
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,110
Yeah!

1115
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,770
Quit your whining.

1117
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,110
I wanna go down here.

1118
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,050
Oh, what's this?

1119
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,530
Oh, we got the Chaingun!

1120
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,510
In 64, you used to have a safe pack like PS1.

1121
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,530
PS1's safe cards.

1122
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,310
I think the password is in case you didn't have one of those.

1123
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,570
Very thoughtful of the devs.

1124
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,750
Oh, that's so sweet!

1125
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,250
Um.

1126
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:48,930
Let's go down.

1127
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:49,210
Pew!

1128
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,370
Pick up all this stuff.

1129
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,210
Oh, nice.

1130
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,370
Let's go back to the other side.

1131
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:58,650
Shoop!

1132
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,810
Pick up everything.

1133
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,470
I think we're done in here.

1134
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,970
So anyway, I started blasting.

1135
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,650
Backpack!

1136
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:18,990
So backpacks allow us to um to hold more stuff.

1137
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,470
He turned into spaghetti!

1138
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,750
Coco demon!

1139
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,730
Coco demon!

1140
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:50,930
Coco demon!

1141
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,170
Why are there more of you?

1142
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,830
Why do you have chains?

1143
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,450
You little freak!

1144
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,970
They don't look so...

1145
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,570
They don't look like I remember.

1146
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,850
They don't look quite like I remember.

1147
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,490
Okay, interesting.

1148
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,190
We got two teleporters here.

1149
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,830
Oh, secret!

1150
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:18,890
No!

1151
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,570
Secret.

1152
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,070
Dang.

1153
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:23,150
They look juicy.

1154
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,350
Super shotgun double barrel shotguns are my favorite guns to get in old school inspired shooters.

1155
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,110
Also, hi Mint.

1156
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,510
Hello!

1157
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,230
Hello, hello.

1158
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:36,550
Okay.

1159
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,890
I guess we'll go through...

1160
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,550
Well, now we know that these guys are about...

1161
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:42,670
Oh!

1162
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,610
It just leads us to upper level.

1163
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,900
Oh.

1164
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,760
Oh!

1165
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,480
Oh.

1166
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:50,980
Oh.

1167
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,300
Let me help, please.

1168
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,020
Oh.

1169
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,810
Okay, so I think both of them are the same, right?

1170
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,950
Who's in there?

1171
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:07,930
Oh, no!

1172
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,030
What are these guys called again?

1173
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,470
Oh, um...

1174
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,490
Oh, not...

1175
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:15,690
Revenant's...

1176
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,410
Lost Souls!

1177
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,190
Lost Souls.

1178
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:18,910
Lost Souls.

1179
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,880
How do I get down?

1180
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,040
Oh, wait.

1181
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,400
Right here?

1182
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,200
Oh.

1183
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,080
Do I need to...

1184
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,320
Do I need to run into it?

1185
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,120
No revenants in here?

1186
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,240
Wait, in this game?

1187
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:42,800
Or...

1188
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,900
Oh, wait.

1189
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,740
There we go.

1190
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,200
Yellow key!

1191
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,000
Did we see a yellow door?

1192
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,020
Did we see a yellow door?

1193
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,160
I don't think I saw one.

1194
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,380
Did I?

1195
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,600
Am I just blind?

1196
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,760
I don't remember seeing a yellow door.

1197
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,220
I don't remember seeing a yellow door.

1198
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,900
Do you guys?

1199
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,700
The very star.

1200
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,440
The very star.

1201
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,760
Was this not the very star?

1202
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:14,520
Was this not the very star?

1203
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,660
The blue key area had another door.

1204
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,300
This one?

1205
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:24,560
This one?

1206
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,100
This seems quite yellow.

1207
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,220
Back to the blue key room.

1208
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,420
Okay, let me go back.

1209
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,380
Oh, I thought you meant like...

1210
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,520
That, as in...

1211
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,260
The room that we used.

1212
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,240
Oh my god, again?

1213
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,640
Why are you respawning?

1214
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,360
Hahaha.

1215
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,400
Hahaha.

1216
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,740
A rocket launcher!

1217
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,060
Oh, this door.

1218
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,700
I see it.

1219
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,680
I don't even notice it.

1220
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,080
Thanks guys.

1221
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,440
It's a lot of armor and a lot of health.

1222
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,720
Wait, which button is...

1223
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,300
Okay, five.

1224
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,540
Four.

1225
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,460
A three.

1226
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,460
Happy Father's Day.

1227
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:35,440
Since I don't have a dad, can you guys be my dad?

1228
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,020
Okay, let me...

1229
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,160
Oh my goodness, the glasses!

1230
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,040
Easy peasy.

1231
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,240
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

1232
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,680
Hahaha.

1233
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,480
Stop playing game and clean your room.

1234
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh my gosh, stop.

1235
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,320
Oh, Hi Pies!

1236
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,920
She's in here with me.

1237
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,900
She might want out though.

1238
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,560
Okay, I guess we just go down.

1239
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,280
What did that open?

1240
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:26,920
Oh!

1241
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,820
A box of rockets!

1242
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,200
Let me out.

1243
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,040
Oh!

1244
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,880
What was that over there?

1245
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,180
Oh, I saw that open up.

1246
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,980
I saw right here it opened up.

1247
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,170
Can I do it again?

1248
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,730
Must have been the wind.

1249
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,390
Haha.

1250
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,580
If I go...

1251
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,280
Wait, eh?

1252
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,990
I'm so confused right now.

1253
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,990
Try going in the door.

1254
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,620
Run, run, run, run, run.

1255
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,600
Run!

1256
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:31,960
Ah!

1257
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,360
No!

1258
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,200
The little thing that would let me go inside disappeared too quickly.

1259
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,000
Okay, hold on.

1260
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,220
Run!

1261
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,440
Am I running?

1262
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,680
I am.

1263
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,200
Okay.

1264
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,200
I gotta be so speedy though.

1265
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,840
Also, what is...

1266
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,980
I guess that one is already activated.

1267
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,500
Oh!

1268
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:04,960
Oh!

1269
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:06,940
Oh!

1270
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,660
What the...

1271
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,120
I'm so confused.

1272
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,160
Jump?

1273
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,540
There is no jump in this game.

1274
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,620
There is no jump in Doom.

1275
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:29,920
Come on!

1276
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,300
Ah!

1277
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,180
I got it!

1278
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:31,520
I got it!

1279
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:31,900
I got it!

1280
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,880
Secret aerial!

1281
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,260
Blast in his ass.

1282
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:42,980
Nice!

1283
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,680
We got it.

1284
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,360
But actually I do need a red key, don't I?

1285
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,000
So...

1286
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,560
Um...

1287
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,040
I do actually need a red key.

1288
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,900
Where do I get that from?

1289
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,540
Hmm...

1290
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,840
This one is already activated.

1291
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,000
This one only opens this door.

1292
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,720
Hmm...

1293
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,480
Right?

1294
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,020
Hmm...

1295
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,380
Blue key room again?

1296
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,180
Oh!

1297
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,300
Who keeps placing stuff here?

1298
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,360
Okay.

1299
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,640
Who keeps putting stuff in there?

1300
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,820
Who keeps putting stuff in there?

1301
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:26,960
Who keeps putting stuff in there?

1302
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,500
Exit already?

1303
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,100
Yippee!

1304
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,520
That's okay.

1305
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,660
I'm not gonna get all the secrets.

1306
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,640
That's okay.

1307
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:37,640
I'm not gonna get all the secrets.

1308
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,010
Oh my god!

1309
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,570
Only 20% of secrets though!

1310
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,770
That's pretty...

1311
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,770
That's pretty crazy.

1312
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:49,930
Um...

1313
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,590
One second.

1314
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,010
One second.

1315
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:54,390
Ahem.

1316
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,570
Holding area.

1317
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,350
You guys...

1318
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,710
Um... be honest with me, though.

1319
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,550
Are you able to see all right and everything?

1320
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,170
Because I can turn up the brightness if you guys need it.

1321
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,410
And holding area.

1322
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:20,110
Doom 64 levels were... big on what?

1323
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,510
Shifting little bits around and changing the layout, adding items that weren't there before.

1324
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,390
That's so cool because it makes you want to explore even more.

1325
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,630
Oh my goodness!

1326
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,770
Oh my god, he was actually invisible!

1327
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,410
That's crazy.

1328
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:54,070
Are all the same monsters and stuff from Doom prior in...

1329
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,850
...this as well?

1330
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,170
Or is there any new guys or anyone missing?

1331
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,030
No,

1332
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,650
no, there's a few missing.

1333
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:11,850
Who's missing?

1334
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,910
Please tell me it's the jockey skulls.

1335
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,290
They're the ones I hate the most.

1336
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,110
Oh wait, why am I picking these up?

1337
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:23,790
It's not doing anything.

1338
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,350
Chain gunner?

1339
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,110
No chain gunner?

1340
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,430
For real?

1341
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,970
I was wondering where those guys were, to be honest.

1342
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,030
Is that a berserk thing?

1343
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,330
How do I get to it?

1344
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,830
Wait, actually I don't...

1345
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:42,890
Oh.

1346
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,610
Oh!

1347
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:47,890
Secret.

1348
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:51,630
Okay.

1349
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,450
No skeleton boys, if that helps.

1350
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:56,870
Really?

1351
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,930
Flashing lights warning soon.

1352
01:01:59,130 --> 01:01:59,770
Oh, thank you.

1353
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,530
ViviCore, thanks for the gift!

1354
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,370
Did?

1355
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,040
Why is the blueberry just right there?

1356
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:19,920
Oh!

1357
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:20,880
Oh!

1358
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:21,500
Oh!

1359
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,360
Oh!

1360
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,320
Woah!

1361
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,460
Oh my god, thank you for the warning!

1362
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,400
Fla...

1363
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:27,760
Flashing...

1364
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,040
Flashing lights!

1365
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,970
Oh jeez!

1366
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,270
Oh god!

1367
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,050
Oh, it was such a bait!

1368
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:34,910
Oh my god!

1369
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,430
Oh my god, oh my god!

1370
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,370
Ahhhh!

1371
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:39,990
Turn it off!

1372
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,590
Turn it off!

1373
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,610
Anything!

1374
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,850
Please, turn it off!

1375
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,760
Oh, hello imp.

1376
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,400
Wow!

1377
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,580
Hello imps!

1378
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,640
Imp party!

1379
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,540
What's in here?

1380
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,100
Oh!

1381
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,100
How do I get that?

1382
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,760
Oh my goodness.

1383
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,800
It's over now.

1384
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,660
Thank goodness.

1385
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,420
That was pretty...

1386
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,460
Regular imps.

1387
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,960
Um, so no chain gunners.

1388
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,620
Um, wait!

1389
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,600
Barons were the, um...

1390
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,020
Were the, uh...

1391
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,800
What's the words?

1392
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,300
I want that.

1393
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,340
There are barons of hell here, yes.

1394
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,100
Okay, okay, okay.

1395
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,400
Barons are in this game.

1396
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,820
But those are not the skelly guys.

1397
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,680
Those are like the big guys that look like, um...

1398
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,800
That look like, you know...

1399
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,120
Like a stereotypical demon.

1400
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:17,380
Okay, this seems like I'm activating a maze of some sort.

1401
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,120
Like I'm lifting walls and moving some things around.

1402
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,780
Or maybe not.

1403
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,200
Maybe I should just activate all of them.

1404
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,600
I'm not quite sure actually.

1405
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,420
I don't know what's going on.

1406
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,000
The big goatman.

1407
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:34,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1408
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:40,770
Hmm.

1409
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:48,690
Hmm.

1410
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,570
Hmm.

1411
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,450
Hmm.

1412
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,990
Hmm.

1413
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,790
How do I get...

1414
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,150
He's floating in the sky.

1415
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,770
He's floating.

1416
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,210
Knights and barons, aka bigger imps.

1417
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1418
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,030
Okay.

1419
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:10,750
Oh!

1420
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:11,610
It's just...

1421
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,870
Oh!

1422
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,030
Oh!

1423
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:13,210
Oh!

1424
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:13,950
Oh my goodness.

1425
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,550
Oh.

1426
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:15,910
Hello.

1427
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,870
It just flew me off.

1428
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,230
I didn't even mean to come down here.

1429
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,430
Are there...

1430
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,090
Are there...

1431
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,070
Are there...

1432
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,230
Um...

1433
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,490
Are there...

1434
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,870
Meatball guys?

1435
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,170
I can't remember what they're called either.

1436
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,010
The uglier cocoa demons?

1437
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,090
How do I get up?

1438
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,570
Just like that?

1439
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,190
There we go.

1440
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,070
Pain elementals!

1441
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,050
Yes.

1442
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,550
So I really only remember Pinky.

1443
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:56,690
Pinky...

1444
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,430
Where was the blue door?

1445
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,570
I don't think I remember seeing it.

1446
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,570
What's this door?

1447
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:08,730
Oh!

1448
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:16,510
Oh!

1449
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,710
I didn't know he could get me from up there.

1450
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,130
I can get him...

1451
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:22,630
Two!

1452
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:25,610
I thought I heard another guy...

1453
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:29,150
Imagining it, perhaps?

1454
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,370
The super shotgun uses two, right?

1455
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,450
We can shoot one that switches.

1456
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:43,710
Oh!

1457
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:44,330
Oh!

1458
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,970
I can shoot that one!

1459
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:46,550
Oh.

1460
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,670
I didn't know if it would be a waste.

1461
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,530
Oh!

1462
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:56,070
Oh!

1463
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,530
That's fun.

1464
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,110
And I activated something.

1465
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:15,870
Oh, there we go.

1466
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:20,550
Now I'm in the zoo.

1467
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,710
Yeah, I discovered...

1468
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:28,130
I realized what it did like as soon as I did it.

1469
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,270
Silly me.

1470
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:30,790
It's okay though.

1471
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:31,670
Okay.

1472
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:31,890
Ah!

1473
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,370
Oh!

1474
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,310
God!

1475
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,440
Where did you come from?

1476
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,680
Good Lord!

1477
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,240
Goodness gracious!

1478
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,960
Scared the heck out of me.

1479
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,320
It's just a skelly man.

1480
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,720
Hmm...

1481
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,000
How do we get that other...

1482
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,340
Oh!

1483
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,760
Hey, buddy.

1484
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,500
All right.

1485
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,240
We got lots of switches around here in this game.

1486
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,560
Oh, no!

1487
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,400
Oh, no!

1488
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,320
Oh, no!

1489
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,240
It's these guys!

1490
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,320
Ow!

1491
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,000
The goats!

1492
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:13,500
The goats!

1493
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:13,920
The goats!

1494
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:14,840
Oh, my goodness.

1495
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,620
Oh, my goodness.

1496
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,060
They're strong.

1497
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,760
Uh...

1498
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,040
Four.

1499
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,280
Ah!

1500
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:28,910
Goats!

1501
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:29,530
The goats!

1502
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:34,730
Anyway...

1503
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,170
Oh!

1504
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,550
No.

1505
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:36,030
I'm in the prison.

1506
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:38,850
Don't forget your rocket launcher.

1507
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:39,690
Oh, you're right.

1508
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,310
I do have that.

1509
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,350
Is this real?

1510
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:42,390
Chat!

1511
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,530
Is this real?

1512
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,610
Oh, no.

1513
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,010
I'm not quite done yet.

1514
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,150
Oh!

1515
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:50,970
Ow!

1516
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:51,490
God!

1517
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:52,450
I wish I were done.

1518
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,330
There was one more.

1519
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,330
At least.

1520
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:56,750
There.

1521
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:07,690
Interesting.

1522
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,870
Do I run across those?

1523
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,990
But how do I get up there?

1524
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:19,770
See you later.

1525
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,030
Bye.

1526
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:22,370
Bye.

1527
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:22,470
Bye.

1528
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,510
Bye.

1529
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:22,530
Bye.

1530
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:22,570
Bye.

1531
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,070
Secret.

1532
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:23,930
Oh!

1533
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:24,610
Blueberry!

1534
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,270
I'm a bit of a genius.

1535
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:30,150
Ah!

1536
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:31,950
Ah!

1537
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:34,970
I got it!

1538
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:35,970
Yippee!

1539
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:42,750
Tensai.

1540
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,900
Oh, so I can't get over there now, though.

1541
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,300
You have to...

1542
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:50,440
Oh!

1543
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,120
Okay.

1544
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,180
Someone was saying that I can't get to that secret area because I guessed wrong.

1545
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:56,880
Oh, man.

1546
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,880
Well, I got this secret area.

1547
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,100
Oh!

1548
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,340
I'll take the second one at least.

1549
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,520
By punching a wall.

1550
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,100
I failed the puzzle.

1551
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,300
How was I supposed to know?

1552
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,480
Oh, well.

1553
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:16,630
Yippee!

1554
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,590
Ninety-five.

1555
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,830
Well, for hell!

1556
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:27,630
Thanks for the ten gifts!

1557
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,870
I got some...

1558
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:35,110
Ow!

1559
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:35,950
Some things.

1560
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:52,610
Edamame from... basically before I left Japan, because I couldn't do anything, on my last day, right before I left, I went to Don Quixote, and I went to a couple, like, um, konbini, and I was like, I'm just buying all the snacks.

1561
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,070
I couldn't buy anything else.

1562
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,830
My suitcases were so empty, so I just bought a bunch of snacks.

1563
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,730
And now I'm eating them.

1564
01:10:58,810 --> 01:10:59,850
And these ones are really good.

1565
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:03,270
I've never had these edamame ones, but I thought they would be, like, the bean part.

1566
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,670
But they're actually quite, um, they're quite fluffy.

1567
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,290
Of course I got jelly.

1568
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:18,850
Ewww!

1569
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:22,270
Oh wow.

1570
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,970
It's red, yellow.

1571
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:31,450
Let's save.

1572
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:34,630
Get down.

1573
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,450
I almost feel like maybe I should have gone harder.

1574
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,710
Well, that's okay.

1575
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,690
It's been a while since I've played Doom, so...

1576
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:55,650
It's fine if I'm, you know, on a little bit of an easier level, I suppose.

1577
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,970
Oh, um, hmm.

1578
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:00,670
Hmm.

1579
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,390
Gets a bit nastier later.

1580
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:06,710
I believe you.

1581
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:20,810
Blue?

1582
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,850
Um, is this the door?

1583
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:25,930
Oh, yes it is!

1584
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:26,690
Absolutely!

1585
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,050
Yeah, you tried.

1586
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,530
You tried.

1587
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:37,650
Nope.

1588
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:39,690
Hmm.

1589
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:41,770
This one?

1590
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:42,710
No.

1591
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:45,270
How do I get you?

1592
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,870
Just reach out and grab it, Doomguy!

1593
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,170
Use your arms!

1594
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,390
You have...

1595
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,010
I clearly have some!

1596
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:53,430
Hold on.

1597
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,890
I'll punch the yellow key.

1598
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,170
I love not having to aim in these.

1599
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,050
I know, right?

1600
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,070
It's such like a...

1601
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,670
It...

1602
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,030
Wow.

1603
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,730
Look at...

1604
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:08,410
Why does...

1605
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,770
The chandelier is so fancy in there.

1606
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,810
My baby arms.

1607
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:16,410
Okay.

1608
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,670
What is...

1609
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:18,730
Oh my goodness!

1610
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,710
It's a party!

1611
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,850
Okay, so yellow key in here.

1612
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,330
Whatever the hell that is in there.

1613
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,890
I think there was a door.

1614
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:37,450
Oh, wait.

1615
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,530
We haven't gone down here yet.

1616
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:40,690
Oh.

1617
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,410
Lost souls.

1618
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:48,490
Ugh.

1619
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,830
Ugh.

1620
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:48,870
Ugh.

1621
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,270
Ugh.

1622
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,790
Ugh.

1623
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,290
Oh my god, please.

1624
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,430
The lost souls look cooler in this game, actually.

1625
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:02,410
They look quite neat.

1626
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,110
I like them.

1627
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,590
I'm grabbing health and it's not doing anything.

1628
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,590
But I can grab more armor.

1629
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:10,790
That's always a thing.

1630
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,350
Okay.

1631
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,650
I don't see a switch.

1632
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:21,610
Paint elementals do too?

1633
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,290
Okay.

1634
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,270
I'm looking...

1635
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,690
Because those guys look goofy as hell in the original.

1636
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,770
Paint elementals look so dumb.

1637
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:33,230
It's really funny...

1638
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,210
Watching...

1639
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,150
What's the word?

1640
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:38,470
Yippee!

1641
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:43,530
It's really funny seeing like Doom Eternal and stuff because I don't recognize...

1642
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:44,190
I'm like, wait...

1643
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:44,950
That's so and so?

1644
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,210
I'm like, wait, that's a pinky?

1645
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:49,290
Oh my goodness.

1646
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:49,930
Ouch!

1647
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,990
I got caught by just a grunt.

1648
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,890
Be careful who you make fun of in middle school.

1649
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,070
Just like that for Doom 3.

1650
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:18,140
Just goofy looking idiots.

1651
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,040
Idiots.

1652
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,580
Oh my goodness!

1653
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,920
Oh my god.

1654
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,120
Oh my god!

1655
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,400
Why these guys are doing the most damage to me?

1656
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,240
It's a little frustrating.

1657
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,620
Nice!

1658
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:48,940
Are there any secrets here?

1659
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,240
Secret...

1660
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:51,980
Secret...

1661
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:53,620
Secret...

1662
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,160
I'm hacking?

1663
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:08,250
Sometimes they really try to get me.

1664
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,890
Okay, that just goes back down I suppose.

1665
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:15,750
Imp?

1666
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:20,510
Hacking?

1667
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:20,950
Hacking?

1668
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,210
Dan!

1669
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,150
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

1670
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:26,210
Thank you!

1671
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,770
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1672
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,310
I got a shotgun.

1673
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:36,290
Oh, super shot!

1674
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:38,190
I already had that though.

1675
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:38,750
That's okay.

1676
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:41,750
Thank you for the meal.

1677
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,830
Ew!

1678
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:47,630
Ew!

1679
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:48,790
Oi!

1680
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,970
Oh this is what happens when I click this.

1681
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,510
And then in here was a whole lot of nothing.

1682
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:01,390
Ugh.

1683
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:02,530
Ugh.

1684
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,190
Okay.

1685
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:08,430
Okay, let's head back.

1686
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:13,050
Um, this room was also empty...

1687
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,190
that I know of.

1688
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:16,290
Hmph!

1689
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,910
There was a door up top.

1690
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:19,430
There was?

1691
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,390
Was I blind?

1692
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,160
Up here?

1693
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,760
Thank you.

1694
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,220
Thank you guys.

1695
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,920
Sometimes I can be a little blind.

1696
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,860
What did that open?

1697
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,460
Here's the question.

1698
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,700
What did it open?

1699
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,840
To be fair, the doors are very similar colors.

1700
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,480
Sometimes I'm just not looking for it, you know?

1701
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,600
I mean, I should be.

1702
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,100
I'll get better about it, I think.

1703
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,680
Eventually.

1704
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,240
Maybe in here?

1705
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,840
No?

1706
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,560
Down in here?

1707
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,760
And here?

1708
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,340
No?

1709
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,640
And... here?

1710
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,820
Something change?

1711
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:31,660
You?

1712
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,120
Aha!

1713
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:37,340
Yellow key!

1714
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,300
It's dog!

1715
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,740
Armogaren!

1716
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,400
Welcome back!

1717
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,080
Thank you guys!

1718
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,120
Thank you, thank you!

1719
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,760
Or welcome.

1720
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:01,530
Blueberry!

1721
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,490
That door is a little bit aggressive.

1722
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:12,550
The wriggling flesh mounds are just a little...

1723
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,090
A little gross.

1724
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:17,870
Doomguy too thick.

1725
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:22,090
Doomguy... These bars are like 10 feet apart.

1726
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,490
We're just...

1727
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:24,790
We're just that...

1728
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,270
We're just that thick, man.

1729
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:29,310
Um...

1730
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,310
What did that open?

1731
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:30,590
Oh!

1732
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,430
Blueberry!

1733
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,910
Blueberry!

1734
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,170
Blueberry secrets!

1735
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,290
Secrets!

1736
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:36,790
Secrets!

1737
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:41,550
Hmm...

1738
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,430
What did it open?

1739
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,850
We went down here before, right?

1740
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,390
What's in here?

1741
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,050
Nothing.

1742
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:51,610
Have we gone here?

1743
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:53,610
Yes.

1744
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:54,250
What?

1745
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,590
I don't recognize these walls at all.

1746
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,170
That's some dude named David Hayter yesterday.

1747
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,710
He was talking about you?

1748
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:04,950
No, he wasn't.

1749
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:10,530
Stop it.

1750
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:12,990
Is this new?

1751
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:14,970
No.

1752
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,570
Where do I go?

1753
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:21,530
I can never tell what...

1754
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:22,850
Where something will activate.

1755
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,730
I can never tell.

1756
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,300
He is a wisp.

1757
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,040
He is a wisp.

1758
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,900
Press the button...

1759
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,340
And it activated.

1760
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,800
What?

1761
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:49,140
Map?

1762
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,400
Uh...

1763
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,720
I hate...

1764
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,960
I'll be honest, I hate the map in Doom.

1765
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:55,240
I hate the map in Doom.

1766
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,360
Because... what does this even mean, first of all?

1767
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,480
But second of all...

1768
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,480
I hate that if I'm checking other places on the map, I have to move with the map.

1769
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,480
Like, for instance, if I'm just like, oh, what's this?

1770
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,220
Like, I'm now here, you know?

1771
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,620
I don't like that.

1772
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,020
You can zoom out with Q and R.

1773
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,460
I do like, though, that it's...

1774
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,600
That it is kind of like...

1775
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,660
Oh, let's check that area.

1776
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:45,940
It is kind of... it's colored based on the...

1777
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,060
Yes, there we go.

1778
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,740
Based on the room.

1779
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,720
Ooh, that was loud.

1780
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,720
Because it helps a lot, actually.

1781
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,040
Uh-oh.

1782
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,260
Another...

1783
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:04,960
Another maze.

1784
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,280
But that does help me.

1785
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,340
I don't want to go berserk.

1786
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,400
I'm not ready to go berserk.

1787
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,820
Boo-boo-boo.

1788
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:26,870
I'll take that.

1789
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,190
Ouch-ah!

1790
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:34,970
Oh,

1791
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,100
this is not real.

1792
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,560
This sure is a maze-y maze.

1793
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,640
Yes, indeed.

1794
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,520
I'll turn around, bozo.

1795
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,120
Oh, come on.

1796
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,780
That's totally something.

1797
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,750
We're activating so much of the system.

1798
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,110
So much stuff.

1799
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,950
Real fake doors.

1800
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,920
That's why.

1801
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,820
These are going to be... I was going to say these will be the end of me.

1802
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,960
But they have already been the end of me.

1803
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,040
And they sound so squishy every time.

1804
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,250
I remember there was a secret.

1805
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,240
I don't want to test every single one though.

1806
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,100
But sometimes these walls open up.

1807
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,780
Oh my god!

1808
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,440
No, no, no!

1809
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:01,760
Please!

1810
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,500
I was walking!

1811
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,400
I got stuck on the wall!

1812
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:06,960
No!

1813
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:24,010
Hmm.

1814
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:27,670
Squish ASMR.

1815
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,590
Okay.

1816
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,490
Where am I?

1817
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,510
Ah!

1818
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,490
I know where we are!

1819
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,630
Actually, that's so funny.

1820
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,710
I know because of this corner.

1821
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:42,230
Yes.

1822
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:42,750
Okay.

1823
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:44,250
Where...

1824
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:46,790
Oh my god.

1825
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,420
Crushers equal minty ectoplasm.

1826
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,120
Yeah, I remember because I tried that light.

1827
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:03,790
Here?

1828
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:05,870
Is this open now?

1829
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,570
Is this all fine and dandy?

1830
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:12,670
Oops.

1831
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,230
Meatball.

1832
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,410
No, that's not the meatball yet even.

1833
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:21,930
We haven't even reached full meatball.

1834
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:23,610
Don't worry.

1835
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,330
We'll get there.

1836
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,370
How do I get the blueberry?

1837
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:33,810
Somehow.

1838
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,240
Look at this eye!

1839
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,280
Oh my god!

1840
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,440
It's so gross!

1841
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,940
It's so nasty.

1842
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,240
Oh!

1843
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,440
See that?

1844
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,180
And the blue key is in there.

1845
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,580
Oh my goodness.

1846
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,860
Are you kidding me right now?

1847
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,980
Wait, I can stand inside, can't I?

1848
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,220
Oh, there's nothing in here though.

1849
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:11,720
Woo!

1850
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:15,620
Yeah.

1851
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,580
Come at me.

1852
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:17,840
Try again.

1853
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,060
Stupid lost souls.

1854
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:21,920
Well done.

1855
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:22,920
Thank you!

1856
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,940
Welcome back from Apkai.

1857
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:29,180
Your summer podcast episodes have been keeping me sane the past few weeks of finance work.

1858
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:29,960
Thank you!

1859
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,520
Thank you for listening!

1860
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,320
I'm so happy!

1861
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,000
Thank you!

1862
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,120
What did I pick up?

1863
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:40,620
The blue key.

1864
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:47,840
Whoa!

1865
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:54,900
A soft, a soft mumble in my ear.

1866
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:55,620
A little...

1867
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:57,960
I heard it.

1868
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,730
Imp ASMR!

1869
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:12,590
Yeah.

1870
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,270
It's exactly what it was.

1871
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:17,950
I saw this one.

1872
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:22,810
These screens must tell me the truth of the blueberry.

1873
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:28,530
I'll never know.

1874
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:32,890
I wonder if I can blow some of them up.

1875
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,490
If that will do anything.

1876
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,030
I'm gonna test all these, sorry.

1877
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:41,570
Now that I know sometimes they'll tell me things, I have to always...

1878
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,870
Oh, what's that?

1879
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:44,770
Hmm?

1880
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,330
Oh, I hear another growl.

1881
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,090
Huh?

1882
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,310
What did that do?

1883
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,110
It turned on and off immediately.

1884
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,210
DoomShotties always hit so good.

1885
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,150
I know, right?

1886
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:08,410
You can even snipe with them, basically.

1887
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:09,210
It's great.

1888
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,390
I can still hear it in here.

1889
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:15,370
Hmm.

1890
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,950
Okay, well I guess we'll go through here.

1891
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:26,970
Nevermind.

1892
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,150
Hello?

1893
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:31,310
Uh-oh.

1894
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:33,290
I need a shotgun emote.

1895
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:36,770
YouTube might get mad at me for that.

1896
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:40,410
They might be like, um, what do you need that for?

1897
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:42,990
Don't worry about it.

1898
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,290
Bubble tea!

1899
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,250
Oh my goodness, I wish I could get some bubble tea.

1900
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:49,630
What?

1901
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:49,710
What?

1902
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,060
Maybe it works now?

1903
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:05,350
What am I missing here?

1904
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:16,190
I thought... oh, I thought, like...

1905
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,910
This was, like, connecting to it somehow.

1906
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:23,690
It turns off immediately.

1907
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:24,810
It's a time switch.

1908
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:25,750
Yeah, but for what?

1909
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,790
Is it timed for this?

1910
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:33,270
Oh!

1911
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,590
Oh, I see, I see it.

1912
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:36,850
Okay.

1913
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,910
Oh, that was a quick... that was really fast.

1914
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:42,450
Okay.

1915
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:44,190
We're back in business, baby.

1916
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,790
Okay, that doesn't open quite yet.

1917
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:47,270
Woo!

1918
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,550
Get out of my way.

1919
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:54,530
Who's behind here?

1920
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,130
Who's in here?

1921
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:56,830
Uh-oh.

1922
01:29:58,710 --> 01:29:59,590
Coco demon!

1923
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,830
Demon!

1924
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:03,890
Eww.

1925
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:06,710
It's supposed to be a fast-paced game.

1926
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:07,250
I know.

1927
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:10,710
I know that I don't go at the right doom pace, okay?

1928
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,930
But I'm a cautious... I'm a cautious ghost.

1929
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:13,850
Can you blame me?

1930
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,550
Oh, this probably... now I probably have to go back.

1931
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:25,410
There we go.

1932
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:31,290
Oh.

1933
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:35,810
Exit!

1934
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:36,590
Exit!

1935
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:40,330
All about tactical espionage action.

1936
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,980
Only 93% kills?

1937
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,560
But I got all the secrets.

1938
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,000
Interesting.

1939
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,000
Makes the game more atmospheric.

1940
01:30:56,380 --> 01:31:00,100
I'm not quite, um... doom guy, you know.

1941
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,300
That guy goes in and he's just like, boom, bam, bam, boom.

1942
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,820
But for me, I'm just like a little baby.

1943
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:13,630
Hmm.

1944
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:19,570
Oh my god.

1945
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:24,300
Eww.

1946
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,480
Ah!

1947
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:33,490
That guy was really gonna come up on me!

1948
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,050
Oh shit.

1949
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:35,530
Uh...

1950
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:37,730
Four.

1951
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:38,870
There we go.

1952
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,910
Okay.

1953
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:42,670
Okay.

1954
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:44,170
Okay.

1955
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,890
Take him down!

1956
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:47,690
Take him down!

1957
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,250
Take him down!

1958
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:51,290
Hell Knight.

1959
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,970
Oh, I need a yellow key for this.

1960
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:57,970
Oh, a hero.

1961
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:58,410
Okay.

1962
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,510
I heard him grunting over there.

1963
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:05,050
Nasty.

1964
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:07,350
Whoop!

1965
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,510
Yeah, yeah, mister.

1966
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:15,570
Oh, shit.

1967
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:15,710
Oh, shit.

1968
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,860
Hi, Mint.

1969
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,160
Hello!

1970
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,240
Hello!

1971
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,360
Oh.

1972
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,280
That actually took quite a bit of my health.

1973
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,100
That wasn't so great.

1974
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,580
That was not so good.

1975
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,740
Ouch-a!

1976
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,700
I hear them.

1977
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,460
I hear them from beyond the walls.

1978
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:03,490
Ah!

1979
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,670
Oh!

1980
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:06,110
They're everywhere!

1981
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,970
Oh my god.

1982
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,230
Shoot.

1983
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,110
Get

1984
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:22,950
them all at once!

1985
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:24,290
Oh my god.

1986
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,290
Ah!

1987
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,250
Bloop!

1988
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:31,790
Uh-oh.

1989
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:32,170
Uh-oh.

1990
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:32,890
The moles in hell.

1991
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:33,490
The moles in hell.

1992
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:34,690
There we go.

1993
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:36,890
Okay.

1994
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,290
Oh my goodness.

1995
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:42,470
Ah!

1996
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:51,250
He's gonna come around the corner any second.

1997
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:52,770
Oh!

1998
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,800
Oh, my god!

1999
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:11,940
I

2000
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:18,670
hope this isn't a waste.

2001
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:19,690
Oh, wait.

2002
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,290
That's just an imp!

2003
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,030
Sorry, mister imp.

2004
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,090
I kind of took...

2005
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:29,470
I kind of really overkilled you.

2006
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:31,290
Sorry, mister imp.

2007
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,430
Imp evaporate.

2008
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,610
They all come from everywhere.

2009
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:47,590
Where?

2010
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,110
How do I get back up there?

2011
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,410
Up here?

2012
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,450
Oh my god.

2013
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,250
Oh my god.

2014
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:54,410
Oh shit.

2015
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:54,810
Oh shit.

2016
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:55,070
Oh shit.

2017
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,640
That imp had a bad day.

2018
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:26,320
I'm having a bad... They're all ganging up on me like crazy.

2019
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:33,900
Like the... I feel like the difficulty went from 0 to 100 all of a sudden.

2020
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,380
There's still more.

2021
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,860
I can't even explore the area.

2022
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:43,000
I'm just like... I'm just a kill... Look at all this.

2023
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:44,160
This is a bloodbath.

2024
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,320
I'm just a killing machine.

2025
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:47,680
Wow.

2026
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,290
Wait.

2027
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:52,410
This is the one...

2028
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:53,610
Which one does this?

2029
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:54,750
I can't remember.

2030
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:58,090
Just you wait.

2031
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:58,890
Oh man.

2032
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:03,230
Yeah, I hear you.

2033
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:09,170
I hear... Actually, I don't remember.

2034
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,510
What's the pink one for?

2035
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:13,090
It's so cute.

2036
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,510
Oopsie.

2037
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:18,990
Oopsie.

2038
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:19,450
Oopsie.

2039
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:29,990
Okay.

2040
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:30,830
Let's go back.

2041
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:37,170
You jerk!

2042
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:42,250
Okay.

2043
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:42,790
Nice.

2044
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,130
Oh...

2045
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:48,290
Yeah, Loki!

2046
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:53,450
Oh, that was... There was the one that we couldn't get.

2047
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:59,490
There was like a... From the main area, there was a little lever that we couldn't pull.

2048
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:01,730
This area is such a maze though.

2049
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,190
I'm getting so lost.

2050
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,170
I'm getting so lost right now.

2051
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:08,010
Did I grab everything in here?

2052
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:10,870
I think so.

2053
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:11,850
Everything that I could.

2054
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,650
Yeah, switch back at the beginning.

2055
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:14,290
Yes, yes, yes.

2056
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:16,430
Yes, yes, yes.

2057
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:20,650
Well, there's some... There's a lot of health around here in case we need it, so...

2058
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,830
Oh.

2059
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:22,370
This way.

2060
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:25,430
It was up there, right?

2061
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:27,930
I still haven't even gotten up here.

2062
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:29,790
What's in here?

2063
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,030
Oh, this is the entrance.

2064
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:32,550
Where I started, I think.

2065
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:34,170
Oh.

2066
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,110
Rip Megasphere.

2067
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:38,830
We'll go back.

2068
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,210
We'll go back.

2069
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:40,530
We'll go back.

2070
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:43,150
Wait.

2071
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,230
This is where I just came from.

2072
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:45,330
See, I'm so lost.

2073
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:48,790
It's okay.

2074
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,930
Okay.

2075
01:37:59,490 --> 01:37:59,910
Oh.

2076
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,690
It's timed.

2077
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,470
I have to find the secret, though.

2078
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:04,770
Yeah.

2079
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,510
Who was that?

2080
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:17,510
You.

2081
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:22,810
Okay.

2082
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:24,470
Let's go back and see if we can find the secret.

2083
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:26,950
Oh.

2084
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:38,910
Wait.

2085
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,050
It opened up, though.

2086
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:41,230
It was just open.

2087
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:45,730
Shinzou, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2088
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:49,550
Cheeky shot.

2089
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,670
Maybe I have to do it on the way down?

2090
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,170
Ah.

2091
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:01,590
Hmm.

2092
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:05,790
I saw it open, though.

2093
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:06,410
I saw it open.

2094
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:11,330
Goodness.

2095
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,710
Oh.

2096
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:14,690
Oh.

2097
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:19,890
Go further out of the corridor, then come back.

2098
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:20,190
Okay.

2099
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,450
Like this way?

2100
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:24,230
Then come back?

2101
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:26,290
Ah!

2102
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:27,210
Thank you!

2103
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,990
Oh.

2104
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:37,730
Dang.

2105
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:39,410
I really thought it was going to lead to...

2106
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:43,010
to the... to the... other sphere.

2107
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,250
The non... the pearl.

2108
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,010
The non-blue... where was that, anyway?

2109
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,110
I can't... I can't even...

2110
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,870
Oh, I found it!

2111
01:39:59,200 --> 01:39:59,550
Meow.

2112
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:08,790
I found it!

2113
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,690
We'll see if you can find the secret.

2114
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:15,090
I knew where it was.

2115
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,510
All along.

2116
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:21,810
Hehehe.

2117
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:26,230
Err.

2118
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:26,570
Hehehe.

2119
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,430
The Jawbreaker...

2120
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:28,970
The Jawbreaker?

2121
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:29,990
Meow.

2122
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:32,810
Okay.

2123
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:35,530
When this comes down...

2124
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,070
Hmm.

2125
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:43,330
Well.

2126
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:43,850
How do I...

2127
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,750
Get over there?

2128
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,090
The Eddie O.V.

2129
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:49,410
Derp.

2130
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,170
Don't call me that!

2131
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:01,350
Are

2132
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,490
we missing something?

2133
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:10,650
Perhaps.

2134
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:24,770
I don't think it's a speed thing.

2135
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:29,630
Because I can't even get around it until it goes down.

2136
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:33,470
And by the time it goes down, this is already up, right?

2137
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:51,650
Like how I sometimes just incidentally run into some of these things.

2138
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,870
That was close.

2139
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,090
That was close.

2140
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:07,650
We straight up drifted across there.

2141
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,490
That was kind of crazy.

2142
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,210
I don't think I can get that guy.

2143
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:13,670
But I can get that guy.

2144
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:17,930
I'm just stumbling my way through here.

2145
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:22,130
It kind of...

2146
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:26,250
It feels like with Metal Gear how they're just like...

2147
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:29,670
Solid Snake was so good at his job.

2148
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:32,010
When a lot of the times he was just like...

2149
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,450
He was just kind of like...

2150
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:35,950
What's going on?

2151
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:36,510
Ow!

2152
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:38,630
Oh my god!

2153
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,650
He was just kind of in the right...

2154
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:43,690
Oh my god!

2155
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:44,130
Oh my god!

2156
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:45,670
Right place at the right time.

2157
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:54,030
Come here.

2158
01:42:59,440 --> 01:42:59,920
Come here.

2159
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:06,660
I don't even want to die.

2160
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:06,820
Jumper!

2161
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:07,080
Die already!

2162
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,510
I hear the Pinkie.

2163
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:13,310
I see him.

2164
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,150
I see the Pinkie.

2165
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:16,770
Come here, Pinkie.

2166
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:19,570
Come here.

2167
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:21,250
Come here, Pinkie.

2168
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:24,530
Come over here.

2169
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:29,510
There we go.

2170
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:31,630
Okie dokie.

2171
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:32,210
Okie dokie.

2172
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:34,110
Good stuff.

2173
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:44,370
I picked up a box of showers.

2174
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:46,350
Pinky pop a hippo bar.

2175
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,390
Box of rockets.

2176
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:51,930
Open up.

2177
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:53,370
Come on!

2178
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:54,370
Open up!

2179
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:57,410
Give me the stuff!

2180
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:57,490
Give me the stuff!

2181
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:04,310
Press the doom button to doom all over your foes.

2182
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:05,990
Doom!

2183
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:06,390
Doom!

2184
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,290
Doom!

2185
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:07,770
Doom!

2186
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:10,250
Nasty.

2187
01:44:11,230 --> 01:44:11,770
Stop!

2188
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:26,390
Open up something.

2189
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,070
Open up that area.

2190
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:43,720
Is there another guy in here?

2191
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,300
No.

2192
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,020
Where did you come from?

2193
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:58,880
There's more of them.

2194
01:44:59,140 --> 01:44:59,160
There's more of them.

2195
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,210
I see what it is!

2196
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:06,330
It's a paint elemental!

2197
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:08,950
Oh my god.

2198
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:10,610
Look at him from here.

2199
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:12,390
Wait, I kind of want to see.

2200
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:12,770
I want to see him though.

2201
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:13,210
Woah!

2202
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:14,250
He kind of looks awesome!

2203
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:17,610
Woah!

2204
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,930
He kind of looks awesome though.

2205
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:30,430
Did I kill him?

2206
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:32,770
I can't tell.

2207
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:35,870
Spice to meet the bow.

2208
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:38,170
I'm always in the wrong place the right time.

2209
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,410
We know.

2210
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:40,870
Oh!

2211
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,230
Hi Huey.

2212
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:43,750
Huey.

2213
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:47,630
Where

2214
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:52,810
am I hearing it from?

2215
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:03,220
Where am I hearing it from?

2216
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:03,820
Where

2217
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,870
am I hearing it from?

2218
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:15,250
I

2219
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:32,290
think it's the last one.

2220
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:36,350
Now I can't see nothing.

2221
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:37,530
Now I can't see nothing.

2222
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,230
Hold on, let me...

2223
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:41,350
I will turn up the display.

2224
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:45,410
I will turn up the display.

2225
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,570
No, we don't need it any more than that.

2226
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:50,690
Overall brightness.

2227
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,350
That's as max as it can go.

2228
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:56,750
I can turn up environmental brightness.

2229
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:57,370
I can turn up environmental brightness.

2230
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:57,930
Maybe that will be better.

2231
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:02,800
Oh my god.

2232
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:07,480
There's so many in here.

2233
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:15,840
There's so many invisible pinkies in here.

2234
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,920
I don't want to go berserk.

2235
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:22,000
I don't want to go berserk.

2236
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,540
How do I get out of here?

2237
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,560
How do I get out of here?

2238
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,800
How do I get out of here?

2239
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:31,960
Spooky!

2240
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,320
Stairs on the wall.

2241
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:44,760
Stairs on the wall.

2242
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:51,530
How can you guys see better than me?

2243
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:51,970
Better than I can.

2244
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:55,450
Stairs on the wall?

2245
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:58,310
This?

2246
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:01,850
How am I supposed to go up it though?

2247
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:03,690
Oh!

2248
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:06,010
What?

2249
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,530
It's like the smallest...

2250
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:09,470
Huh?

2251
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:11,470
Wow!

2252
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:13,830
How the hell am I doing this?

2253
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:15,250
I think I'm...

2254
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:18,010
Oh my god I can kind of see them now.

2255
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:19,310
What the hell?

2256
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,690
What are these?

2257
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:26,470
These stairs are for...

2258
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:28,490
the thinnest person alive.

2259
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,650
Legs of a mountain goat.

2260
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,250
Exactly!

2261
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,710
What is this for real?

2262
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:41,070
Hahaha!

2263
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:48,010
Actual legs of a mountain goat.

2264
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:49,910
Okay hold on.

2265
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:51,130
I don't want to quite do that yet.

2266
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:53,070
Can't go in there.

2267
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:55,750
Okay.

2268
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,070
But there was a door...

2269
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:57,930
That door over there.

2270
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:01,390
No wonder everybody is dead here!

2271
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:05,490
Okay never mind.

2272
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:06,410
That is not a door.

2273
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:09,230
This seems to...

2274
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:09,710
Hmm.

2275
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,850
How do I get to the blueberry?

2276
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:13,350
Hmm.

2277
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:16,470
Hmm hmm hmm.

2278
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,130
Indeed.

2279
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:20,630
Ah!

2280
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:21,090
Huh.

2281
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:23,390
Good thing there is no fall damage.

2282
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:24,570
It's just...

2283
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,230
It's just horribly obnoxious.

2284
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,030
Okay I'm going to go through this one.

2285
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,070
Oh it took me back to here.

2286
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:33,630
Okay.

2287
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:35,230
Alright.

2288
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,130
We running.

2289
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:39,750
Run!

2290
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:41,010
Just run!

2291
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,830
Just run!

2292
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:47,620
I don't know what I did.

2293
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:50,280
It's so bright now.

2294
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:52,500
I can turn it down.

2295
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,480
It looks all the same for me.

2296
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,980
It truly only looks different.

2297
01:49:58,920 --> 01:49:59,520
In...

2298
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,440
In OBS which is so strange.

2299
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,080
Hmm.

2300
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,960
Do I go back down there now?

2301
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:11,500
Hmm.

2302
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:18,440
Let's try this one.

2303
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:19,460
Oh!

2304
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:20,580
They are both the same.

2305
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,720
How do I blueberry?

2306
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,260
Well I don't really need it.

2307
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,680
But I kind of just want it.

2308
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,400
You know?

2309
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:29,500
Hmm.

2310
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,480
Kind of just want it.

2311
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,160
Hmm.

2312
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:38,780
Just to have it.

2313
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,020
You know?

2314
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:39,840
Hmm.

2315
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,820
Hmm.

2316
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,360
Am I trapped here?

2317
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,960
I'm picking up stuff that I don't need.

2318
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,520
But that's okay.

2319
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:51,900
Oh!

2320
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:52,480
Oh.

2321
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,040
I needed that.

2322
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,400
Very nice.

2323
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:02,520
Smallest, thinnest walls in history.

2324
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,480
Someone said...

2325
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:07,820
Try running off into the...

2326
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:09,320
the side into the room.

2327
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,400
But like there's a...

2328
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,020
There's like...

2329
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,800
There's no way to get into it.

2330
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:20,210
And then also there's stuff in here.

2331
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:21,070
There's so much stuff!

2332
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:25,290
I also need to get the blue...

2333
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:27,550
Oh.

2334
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:28,190
Dang it.

2335
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:29,910
Maybe it's open now.

2336
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:34,750
Oh come on.

2337
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:37,410
The button room.

2338
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,630
You can get it from the top.

2339
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:39,970
I can.

2340
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,990
Hold on.

2341
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:45,030
So why would you go up...

2342
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:46,070
after I leave the platform?

2343
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:52,310
Oh there it is.

2344
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,730
It is open.

2345
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:53,650
Look at that.

2346
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:56,250
Would you look at that.

2347
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:00,890
From the button room.

2348
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:03,270
I can make it.

2349
01:52:04,110 --> 01:52:04,510
Ah!

2350
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:04,930
Wow!

2351
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:07,610
Wow!

2352
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:09,050
Wow!

2353
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:11,670
Let's see.

2354
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:15,170
Is there a secret door?

2355
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,750
I feel like...

2356
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:19,150
so blind in this.

2357
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:26,470
Too used to the convenience of...

2358
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:27,610
modern game design.

2359
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,490
I did not mean to press that.

2360
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:36,510
My fingers slipped...

2361
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:37,670
as I was drinking my tea.

2362
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,050
Now we're back.

2363
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:42,310
Oh!

2364
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:44,030
I think I need to run off here.

2365
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:44,530
Okay.

2366
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:44,810
Okay.

2367
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:45,050
Okay.

2368
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:45,650
I understand.

2369
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:47,230
I see.

2370
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:47,730
I see.

2371
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:49,050
I understand now.

2372
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:52,470
Maybe from like here?

2373
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:54,930
There we go.

2374
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:57,310
Okay.

2375
01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,170
Then from there.

2376
01:52:59,530 --> 01:52:59,970
Oh!

2377
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:01,090
It opens up the door over there.

2378
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:01,550
Ah!

2379
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:09,030
Let's go back up the stairs.

2380
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,290
Oh!

2381
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,550
Oh!

2382
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:13,970
Oh!

2383
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:14,530
It was timed.

2384
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:16,670
It was timed.

2385
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:21,050
There we go.

2386
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:21,690
Huh!

2387
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:23,470
Yeah!

2388
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:30,230
Blah!

2389
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:30,950
Blah!

2390
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:31,610
Blah!

2391
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:31,750
Blah!

2392
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:34,830
Oh!

2393
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,090
Come on!

2394
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:39,150
Blah!

2395
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:39,770
Blah!

2396
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:40,010
Blah!

2397
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:40,210
Blah!

2398
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:42,930
Blah!

2399
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:44,910
What the heck?

2400
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:47,270
Why could I do it first time before?

2401
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:48,010
And now...

2402
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,850
She got it first try to never get it again.

2403
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:58,640
There we go.

2404
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,600
Now, run.

2405
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,140
But don't fall.

2406
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:02,680
Run!

2407
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:02,860
Run!

2408
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:03,080
Run!

2409
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:03,280
Run!

2410
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:04,880
Yippee!

2411
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:10,680
What did that do?

2412
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:13,980
Wait, maybe that opens for the armor?

2413
01:54:21,950 --> 01:54:22,350
Maybe?

2414
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:28,060
Yippee!

2415
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:29,060
Oh.

2416
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,820
Too good at this game.

2417
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,640
I'm too good at this game.

2418
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,480
Well, we know where it is if we need it, you know?

2419
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:42,280
Okay, blue key, blue door.

2420
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:42,780
Right here.

2421
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:43,620
Okay.

2422
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:44,140
Finally.

2423
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,080
Back to killing things.

2424
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:47,640
Oh god!

2425
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,620
Why did it have to be you?

2426
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:55,160
Three of them!

2427
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:56,660
This is so unfair.

2428
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,200
Oh, ouch.

2429
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,040
Ouch, ouch.

2430
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,400
I think it's because you're playing literally on...

2431
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:11,580
What?

2432
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:12,940
No, everybody said this was normal.

2433
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,260
What are you talking about?

2434
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,480
Everybody said this was normal.

2435
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:27,110
63%, 66% secrets.

2436
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:27,970
What did I miss?

2437
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:29,270
Hmm.

2438
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:36,850
What's that?

2439
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:39,330
Is the BFG in this game?

2440
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:41,550
Red key, yellow key.

2441
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:48,370
It is?

2442
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:51,710
Oh, I should save.

2443
01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:54,010
Hmm,

2444
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:57,720
hmm.

2445
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:07,830
Hmm.

2446
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:10,170
Wow, exactly...

2447
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:11,870
Oh my goodness!

2448
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:12,990
Ah!

2449
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:20,070
Well, I had exactly enough...

2450
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:21,190
To be...

2451
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:23,570
To be...

2452
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:24,650
Full health.

2453
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:26,510
Dang.

2454
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:33,870
You kept us waiting but you returned to doom hell.

2455
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:36,110
Rip and tear until it is done.

2456
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,850
Rip and tear until it is done.

2457
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:44,950
Rip and tear!

2458
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:48,530
I hear another guy.

2459
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:50,270
He's snoring.

2460
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:50,750
He's snoring.

2461
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:02,050
I hear him.

2462
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:02,650
I hear him.

2463
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:09,610
I hear him.

2464
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:10,550
I don't even stand a chance.

2465
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:11,310
I don't even stand a chance.

2466
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:13,290
Woo!

2467
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:15,810
Oh, wait.

2468
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:17,990
Save some of that.

2469
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:21,390
What's wrong with this room?

2470
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,830
What's wrong with this room?

2471
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:23,250
Oh.

2472
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:27,570
Oh!

2473
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:28,990
Oh!

2474
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:30,870
Area map!

2475
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:33,650
Yippee!

2476
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:35,150
Hahaha!

2477
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:39,090
Today is my birthday!

2478
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:40,750
Wait, who sent that?

2479
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:43,170
Okay!

2480
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:44,330
Happy birthday!

2481
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:49,930
Moppy!

2482
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:51,610
Oh my god, that's a throwback.

2483
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:52,030
Hahaha!

2484
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:53,690
Moppy!

2485
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:58,130
Throwback to that time.

2486
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,130
I played...

2487
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:03,750
Doom and I couldn't read.

2488
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,910
Doom and I couldn't read.

2489
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:06,870
Oh!

2490
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:09,150
Oh!

2491
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,670
Oh yeah...

2492
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:14,410
Oh yeah...

2493
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:19,230
What's this?

2494
01:58:19,490 --> 01:58:20,830
I was gonna say, did I go in here?

2495
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:33,310
I was gonna

2496
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:36,690
say, did I go in here?

2497
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:38,010
All these poor little scientists.

2498
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:41,150
All these poor little nerds.

2499
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:47,650
I'm guessing they're scientists.

2500
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:50,190
You know?

2501
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:52,210
Okay, so this is where I...

2502
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:52,850
Yes.

2503
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:56,350
That's what it showed me in the...

2504
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:56,450
Oh!

2505
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:00,190
Yeah!

2506
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:01,690
Yeah!

2507
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:03,310
Hahaha!

2508
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:07,070
Wait, can I not reopen it?

2509
01:59:07,850 --> 01:59:08,610
No!

2510
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:10,990
Blueberry!

2511
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,490
Hahaha!

2512
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:16,030
Oh my god!

2513
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:16,550
Oh my god!

2514
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:18,330
More marines just not as cool as you.

2515
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:20,290
Got it.

2516
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,150
No way!

2517
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:22,310
Yay!

2518
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:27,710
Literally blue balled.

2519
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:28,450
Don't say that.

2520
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,770
Shoot the switch.

2521
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:43,280
I wonder if I can redo it.

2522
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:43,700
Hahaha.

2523
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:01,670
I can't remember where I've been.

2524
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:03,350
Oh!

2525
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:04,350
Oh!

2526
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:06,190
That opened something.

2527
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:08,430
In here?

2528
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,690
No.

2529
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:19,100
This is where...

2530
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,520
I just came from.

2531
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:26,040
I'm so lost.

2532
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,280
I don't remember.

2533
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:30,520
I don't remember at all.

2534
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,580
Oh well.

2535
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:33,500
That's okay.

2536
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:36,960
I don't need the blueberry so much anyway.

2537
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:37,440
Oh wait.

2538
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:40,460
Oh yeah, see it's still activated.

2539
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:41,980
That's okay.

2540
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:42,800
Here's the map.

2541
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,420
What was the special map that I got?

2542
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:49,460
What even does it...

2543
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:50,600
What's its purpose?

2544
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,050
Oh!

2545
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:02,630
I want that.

2546
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:04,210
Well, I don't need it right now.

2547
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:05,010
But I want it.

2548
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:08,730
Ah!

2549
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,220
Switch?

2550
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:18,380
Not a switch.

2551
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,700
Maybe a switch.

2552
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:23,800
Punch the switch.

2553
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:24,860
Shoot the switch.

2554
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:28,540
I can't read maps.

2555
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:29,120
It's true!

2556
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:31,280
Actually.

2557
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,100
Thank you very much.

2558
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,880
This is the most...

2559
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:36,840
You can read this?

2560
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,580
What does it mean?

2561
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,360
What does it mean?

2562
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,760
Here we go.

2563
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:53,010
Flashing lights.

2564
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:56,150
Oh my god.

2565
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:59,110
Jump scared by his booty.

2566
02:02:03,370 --> 02:02:04,270
Wait, the exit!

2567
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:06,050
Oh, it's right there.

2568
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:08,330
I need a yellow key.

2569
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:10,790
There's so many things we need.

2570
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:13,870
Okay.

2571
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:16,870
Cake scare.

2572
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:20,210
Good morning!

2573
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:21,250
Good morning!

2574
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:24,130
Okay, so we need the red key for both of these then.

2575
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:24,690
Got it.

2576
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:28,870
Oh!

2577
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:30,770
We're right here.

2578
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:33,110
Where we...

2579
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:33,810
Huh?

2580
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:36,870
Wait, what is that showing?

2581
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:37,250
Oh!

2582
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:37,990
Okay.

2583
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,390
It's showing that room.

2584
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:40,870
God.

2585
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:42,310
What a tease.

2586
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:44,390
What an actual tease.

2587
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:47,470
I can't go through here yet.

2588
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:48,390
Oh, I can go through here!

2589
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:52,810
That guy is mashing interact on the secret rooms of my heart.

2590
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:56,190
Ah!

2591
02:02:58,930 --> 02:02:59,670
Oh shoot.

2592
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:01,010
Oh my god!

2593
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:01,950
Oh my god!

2594
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:02,550
Oh my god!

2595
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:16,860
Where the hell did you come from?

2596
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:21,420
New weapon.

2597
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:28,320
This is the plasma gun, isn't it?

2598
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,010
From hell?

2599
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:35,830
From hell?

2600
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:36,330
Duh.

2601
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:37,210
Duh-beem.

2602
02:03:39,830 --> 02:03:40,630
Yellow key.

2603
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:44,410
Who is grunting?

2604
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:46,570
All I can hear is grunting everywhere.

2605
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:46,910
All I can hear is grunting everywhere.

2606
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:47,290
Chuu!

2607
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:48,490
Chuu!

2608
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:52,910
I gotta do an early stream for my favorite series.

2609
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:53,970
I just got off work.

2610
02:03:54,810 --> 02:03:55,370
Sorry!

2611
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:57,750
Um...

2612
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:58,410
Wait.

2613
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,790
I needed the yellow key.

2614
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:00,610
In here, right?

2615
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:02,750
That's because it's the weekend.

2616
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:06,290
I tend to do earlier streams on the weekend.

2617
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:08,090
It's all...

2618
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:09,410
Okay.

2619
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:09,750
Yellow.

2620
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:12,130
Is this also yellow?

2621
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:13,330
Nope.

2622
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:14,350
Okay.

2623
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:18,310
Mr. Snoring up in here.

2624
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:21,530
Gosh.

2625
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:24,070
This game is so...

2626
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:30,150
This game is so...

2627
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:32,170
Stinky!

2628
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:37,460
Who is snoring?

2629
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:43,050
Who is snoring?

2630
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:43,530
Is it you?

2631
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:44,010
Is it you?

2632
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:46,610
Have you been snoring this whole time?

2633
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:49,830
Have you been snoring this whole time?

2634
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:52,290
Have I been in here?

2635
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:54,230
Have I been in here?

2636
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:56,050
Uh...

2637
02:04:56,050 --> 02:04:56,890
This is where I...

2638
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:57,370
Oh...

2639
02:04:57,770 --> 02:04:58,090
Wait.

2640
02:04:58,230 --> 02:04:58,490
Yes.

2641
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:02,110
Is stinky a good thing?

2642
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:02,810
Yeah.

2643
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:04,650
It's like a...

2644
02:05:05,690 --> 02:05:06,230
You!

2645
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:09,690
When I get my hands on you!

2646
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:11,010
Kind of feeling.

2647
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:16,750
Energy...

2648
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:17,210
Yeah, yeah.

2649
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:18,130
That's what I need for the gun.

2650
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:21,390
Welcome to membership.

2651
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:23,270
Thank you so much.

2652
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:25,470
Thank you.

2653
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:27,730
So much.

2654
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:30,090
Losing health like crazy.

2655
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:32,090
Okay.

2656
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:32,970
This is where we came from.

2657
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:33,250
Sorry.

2658
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:34,710
I'm a bit lost if you couldn't tell.

2659
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:37,170
Oh my god.

2660
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:38,230
I'm...

2661
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:39,470
Trapped?

2662
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:50,730
Maybe I don't need to use the giant...

2663
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:52,630
Whatever's for that guy.

2664
02:05:52,910 --> 02:05:53,310
But...

2665
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:56,530
It's fun to use the rocket launcher.

2666
02:05:58,710 --> 02:05:59,110
Hmm.

2667
02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:04,470
Why are you grunting?

2668
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:05,170
Over what?

2669
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:06,370
Uh oh.

2670
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,650
We can't go in here.

2671
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:12,350
Hmm...

2672
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:14,450
Can I walk along the walls?

2673
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:19,120
I can.

2674
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:25,640
Nice.

2675
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:29,240
Oh.

2676
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,000
I could have just literally taken the stairs.

2677
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:31,820
Hahaha.

2678
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:34,180
Hahaha.

2679
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,520
I could have literally taken the stairs.

2680
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:38,180
But...

2681
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:39,920
That's okay.

2682
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:44,430
We have the...

2683
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:50,830
Where haven't we gone?

2684
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:52,270
What's that red...

2685
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:53,650
Red bit?

2686
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:55,970
Right there.

2687
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:56,590
Oh.

2688
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:57,010
That's the exit.

2689
02:06:59,510 --> 02:07:00,130
Um...

2690
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:04,150
What the?

2691
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:04,610
Oh.

2692
02:07:04,670 --> 02:07:04,930
Oh.

2693
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,650
Oh.

2694
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:08,170
Don't scare me like that.

2695
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:09,710
Don't scare me like that.

2696
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:11,230
Remember to...

2697
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:11,650
Yes.

2698
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:12,050
Thank you.

2699
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:15,110
Where haven't we gone?

2700
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:16,330
Where haven't we gone?

2701
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:18,850
Obviously past those bars.

2702
02:07:19,870 --> 02:07:20,570
Obviously past those bars.

2703
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:21,070
Um...

2704
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:25,760
Um...

2705
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:30,620
Showing the blueberry on the map.

2706
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:30,760
Showing the blueberry on the map.

2707
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:31,100
So evil.

2708
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:34,320
Oh.

2709
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,040
Goodness.

2710
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:36,200
Oh.

2711
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,440
Goodness.

2712
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:40,820
Take that.

2713
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,240
Take that.

2714
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:46,120
We've pressed that.

2715
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:46,540
We've pressed that.

2716
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,420
Where haven't we been?

2717
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:49,600
Hmm...

2718
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,540
Pressing F might help you move freely?

2719
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:54,920
Pressing F might help you move freely?

2720
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:57,620
No.

2721
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,700
I don't think so.

2722
02:07:59,120 --> 02:07:59,420
No.

2723
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:00,800
I don't think so.

2724
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,680
Worth a shot though.

2725
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,820
Maybe I have to go up to those bars?

2726
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:06,860
Hmm...

2727
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:11,120
What was that teleporter over there?

2728
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:12,460
What was that teleporter over there?

2729
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:14,300
Hmm...

2730
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,840
There was a switch.

2731
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,120
Not sure if you shot it already.

2732
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:19,460
There was a switch.

2733
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:19,460
Not sure if you shot it already.

2734
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:19,840
Wait.

2735
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,880
The one that I tried to shoot and it wouldn't let me?

2736
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:25,920
Um... Where was it?

2737
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:27,420
Back through here?

2738
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:28,760
I think?

2739
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:33,020
Can't do this.

2740
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:33,800
Can't do this.

2741
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:34,720
Huh.

2742
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:35,420
Huh.

2743
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:37,340
Through here?

2744
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:42,580
I got both of these.

2745
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:43,860
What was through here?

2746
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:45,760
Oh yeah.

2747
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:46,120
That's right.

2748
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,000
It took me to this switch.

2749
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:52,260
And then...

2750
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,020
The bars and the acid.

2751
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:55,360
Yeah.

2752
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:56,820
That's the only thing...

2753
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,900
I can think of to try.

2754
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,260
Going to.

2755
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:04,510
Oh!

2756
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:04,770
Oh!

2757
02:09:05,610 --> 02:09:06,130
Oh!

2758
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:08,890
They open.

2759
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:14,890
What?

2760
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,050
They're trying to close.

2761
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:20,170
Don't close on my head, please.

2762
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:21,830
Okay.

2763
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:25,250
Nice.

2764
02:09:26,450 --> 02:09:26,930
So...

2765
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:30,770
Don't forget to save.

2766
02:09:30,810 --> 02:09:31,530
You're so right.

2767
02:09:31,670 --> 02:09:32,070
Oh my gosh.

2768
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:33,210
I should totally save right here.

2769
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,290
You're so right.

2770
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:37,590
Okay.

2771
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:42,790
Oh!

2772
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:43,550
Oh!

2773
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:45,950
No!

2774
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:47,050
Hahaha!

2775
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:58,730
Oh!

2776
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,370
There's a door right here.

2777
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,250
Oh!

2778
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,010
Are you kidding me?

2779
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:09,670
Oh!

2780
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:10,590
My eyes!

2781
02:10:15,630 --> 02:10:16,950
My eyes!

2782
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:18,990
My eyes!

2783
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:31,170
It would not be a Doom game if not for just some bullshit like this.

2784
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:33,190
Oh my goodness.

2785
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:33,670
Ah!

2786
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,330
Ah!

2787
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:41,710
I could really use a blueberry right now.

2788
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:42,250
Hahaha!

2789
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:44,350
Is that everything?

2790
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,530
Did something secret elf went up over here?

2791
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:46,730
No?

2792
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:47,170
Okay.

2793
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:48,170
Let's get out of here.

2794
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:51,410
Hahaha!

2795
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:52,790
Oh my god!

2796
02:10:54,490 --> 02:10:55,550
Are you guys okay?

2797
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:56,370
Can we see?

2798
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:57,490
Are we still alive?

2799
02:10:58,230 --> 02:10:59,450
Well, I've never been...

2800
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:00,050
Oh my god!

2801
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,150
I can't see anything!

2802
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:02,090
Ah!

2803
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:06,920
Okay.

2804
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:08,760
Let's just close our eyes until it's gone.

2805
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:09,200
Okay.

2806
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:10,160
We're good.

2807
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:16,220
It's probably lowered the things in here?

2808
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:18,420
Yes.

2809
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:22,840
All according to

2810
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:31,030
Where was the red door at?

2811
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:36,650
Where was the red door at?

2812
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:40,790
Oh, it was the environmental brightness.

2813
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:42,010
Oh, my bad.

2814
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:45,330
Was it under display?

2815
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:47,030
No, I didn't.

2816
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:47,990
I raised it.

2817
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:48,910
I lowered it.

2818
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:50,130
I didn't raise it that much.

2819
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:53,350
Well, that should be better.

2820
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:55,510
Okay.

2821
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:56,750
Red door.

2822
02:11:58,830 --> 02:12:01,290
Is this what happens when you do the do?

2823
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:03,190
Actually.

2824
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:05,370
Real doing the do footage.

2825
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:07,130
Where was the red door?

2826
02:12:08,810 --> 02:12:10,050
There are red switches.

2827
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:11,470
There are?

2828
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:15,170
I'm looking.

2829
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:17,230
Is it that over there?

2830
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:23,430
Is it secret?

2831
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:24,850
No.

2832
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:24,930
No.

2833
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,790
Secret?

2834
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:28,470
No.

2835
02:12:31,490 --> 02:12:32,710
Actually, I have no idea.

2836
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:33,750
I don't know where to go.

2837
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:34,890
Yellow?

2838
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:37,590
In here?

2839
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:38,530
I think?

2840
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:40,710
And then in here?

2841
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:42,970
Nope.

2842
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,370
Just kidding.

2843
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:45,830
This way?

2844
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:52,350
This one?

2845
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:55,930
I still can't touch this one.

2846
02:12:58,690 --> 02:12:59,410
This is...

2847
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:00,330
Oh, this is what I just got.

2848
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:01,890
Okay.

2849
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:04,250
This leads back to the green.

2850
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:06,050
In here.

2851
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:06,710
Oh!

2852
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,350
I don't see any in here.

2853
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:19,770
Hold on.

2854
02:13:21,070 --> 02:13:22,810
I'm checking the map.

2855
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:25,530
Where did I miss a switch?

2856
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:28,630
You passed the switches.

2857
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:29,030
I did?

2858
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:31,250
Here?

2859
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:35,950
Why can't I see anything?

2860
02:13:36,910 --> 02:13:40,470
Is there any chance of you playing the ROM hack Doom?

2861
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:42,350
Someday.

2862
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:43,250
It's really good.

2863
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:44,150
Maybe.

2864
02:13:46,070 --> 02:13:46,590
Oh!

2865
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:48,090
I forgot.

2866
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:49,630
Oh!

2867
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:57,480
I forgot that I didn't press those.

2868
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,900
Because they were lit up, I thought that I had pressed them.

2869
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:02,680
How do I get back there?

2870
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:07,460
Oh, shoot.

2871
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:13,320
Here?

2872
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:19,510
Get me in there.

2873
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:24,730
Oh, okay.

2874
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:26,730
I just needed to press one of them.

2875
02:14:27,230 --> 02:14:28,290
There we go!

2876
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:44,470
25% secrets.

2877
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:45,590
Hmm...

2878
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:47,530
Entering the final outpost.

2879
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:06,210
Oh, I love them.

2880
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:09,150
Oh, my memory.

2881
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:20,460
What a jerk.

2882
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:25,650
Oh.

2883
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,330
Oh.

2884
02:15:30,550 --> 02:15:31,510
Oh, thank you.

2885
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:44,800
Oh, my goodness.

2886
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:52,320
Can I shoot some of these guys?

2887
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:53,460
Maybe with a...

2888
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:01,160
Find someone who loves you as much as Doomguy loves oofing his walls.

2889
02:16:12,010 --> 02:16:13,430
I can't tell if they're...

2890
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:16,370
If it's ambiance I'm hearing or...

2891
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:17,410
Wow, this is kind of...

2892
02:16:17,410 --> 02:16:17,570
Oh!

2893
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:20,050
Oh, that was close.

2894
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:23,990
Hey!

2895
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:26,950
Where are you?

2896
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:32,210
Did I get him?

2897
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:33,570
I can't tell.

2898
02:16:34,710 --> 02:16:36,130
I can't tell at all.

2899
02:16:36,310 --> 02:16:36,890
That's okay, though.

2900
02:16:38,970 --> 02:16:39,470
Okay.

2901
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:41,590
Saving the game.

2902
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:56,320
Oh, my God.

2903
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,620
There's so many sounds.

2904
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:02,900
Spooky!

2905
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,240
Got the chaingun again.

2906
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:10,880
This goes the same way.

2907
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:11,240
Okay.

2908
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:13,200
So this is where I just killed all those guys.

2909
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:13,600
Yep, yep, yep.

2910
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:16,100
Umm...

2911
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:19,280
It makes me feel good.

2912
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:21,980
Yeah, I'm a safe scummer.

2913
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:22,840
What of it?

2914
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:28,110
What are these sounds?

2915
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:31,230
I think I got him.

2916
02:17:31,430 --> 02:17:31,910
Yep.

2917
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:48,270
Sometimes I feel more safe with the chaingun and sometimes I feel more safe with the shotty.

2918
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:53,790
Okay.

2919
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:56,290
They could have limited your saves if they were really worried about it.

2920
02:17:57,730 --> 02:18:02,190
Sometimes it's so hard to tell if an older game is going to be nice to you or not.

2921
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:03,230
You know what I mean?

2922
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:05,730
Sometimes they're just like...

2923
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:10,690
Sometimes they're like...

2924
02:18:11,310 --> 02:18:14,570
Yeah, we'll give you all this nice stuff.

2925
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,650
Sometimes they're just evil.

2926
02:18:18,050 --> 02:18:19,430
Okay, so we don't have a blue key.

2927
02:18:19,630 --> 02:18:20,010
Let's keep going.

2928
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:26,890
I gotta make it really hard so that you don't just... Okay.

2929
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,870
What's gonna happen here?

2930
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,210
Oh!

2931
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:36,250
What I do like about the chaingun is it does kind of stun them for a second.

2932
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,870
So they can't really like do much.

2933
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:46,140
What am I hearing?

2934
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:47,180
What am I hearing?

2935
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:49,420
Is it the spider?

2936
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:49,580
Is it the spider?

2937
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:53,660
Is it ambience?

2938
02:18:58,810 --> 02:19:00,310
I can't tell at all.

2939
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:01,690
I can't tell at all.

2940
02:19:01,890 --> 02:19:03,290
What's going on?

2941
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:05,390
Spooky BGM.

2942
02:19:08,450 --> 02:19:09,650
It's really spooky.

2943
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:13,830
Yay!

2944
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,830
Oh no!

2945
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:20,310
Uh oh.

2946
02:19:21,770 --> 02:19:22,330
Blue.

2947
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:24,910
Blue water.

2948
02:19:26,550 --> 02:19:27,110
Oh!

2949
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:34,230
Nice!

2950
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,230
Secret.

2951
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:39,550
The blood made it...

2952
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:40,690
Where am I supposed to go from here?

2953
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:41,190
Actually.

2954
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:44,450
Uh...

2955
02:19:45,930 --> 02:19:46,530
Uh...

2956
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:50,070
Hacking?

2957
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:57,280
Actually he won't...

2958
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,560
He doesn't want to hack this wall.

2959
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:06,300
I don't like the music at all.

2960
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:08,360
It's making me really paranoid.

2961
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:13,680
It's making me super ultra paranoid.

2962
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:20,710
It's making me super ultra paranoid.

2963
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:20,790
It's making me super ultra paranoid.

2964
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:24,170
I'm so scared right now.

2965
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:24,730
Okay.

2966
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:26,070
I guess I'll flip this switch.

2967
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:26,690
Oh!

2968
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:33,010
Oh my health!

2969
02:20:35,470 --> 02:20:37,590
I could use a blueberry right now.

2970
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:40,090
Why did my health go down so much?

2971
02:20:40,110 --> 02:20:42,370
When my armor was at max.

2972
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,550
It's kind of messed up.

2973
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:45,670
Okay.

2974
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:46,650
Box of bullets.

2975
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:53,730
There's lots of armor in here.

2976
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:54,310
Which is nice.

2977
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:01,750
They literally phased into existence!

2978
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:07,090
They didn't even come from anywhere!

2979
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:09,470
They didn't even come from behind a wall!

2980
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:10,830
They just...

2981
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:13,830
Ghost men.

2982
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:14,990
Yeah!

2983
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:16,630
They lined up for me though.

2984
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:17,050
So true.

2985
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:18,870
I hear them.

2986
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:19,090
Oh!

2987
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:20,250
Oh shit.

2988
02:21:28,690 --> 02:21:30,630
Oh I'm gonna run out of bullets at this rate.

2989
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:33,830
Yikes.

2990
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,510
Yikes!

2991
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:38,850
Rocket launcher!

2992
02:21:39,130 --> 02:21:40,250
Maybe I should have used that.

2993
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:41,710
That's fine though.

2994
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:44,390
More shotgun shells.

2995
02:21:48,030 --> 02:21:49,190
Box of rockets.

2996
02:21:52,270 --> 02:21:53,030
Ow!

2997
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:53,950
Shit.

2998
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:54,790
Oh my god.

2999
02:22:03,450 --> 02:22:04,210
Nice.

3000
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:06,190
Okay.

3001
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:10,030
We're full on rockets.

3002
02:22:12,670 --> 02:22:13,810
She's so clutch.

3003
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:15,730
Am I though?

3004
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:16,730
My health.

3005
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:18,610
I need a blueberry.

3006
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:21,630
I need a blueberry!

3007
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:25,010
Where was the red door anyway?

3008
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,090
Oh.

3009
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:26,490
Wait.

3010
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:26,890
Hold on.

3011
02:22:27,010 --> 02:22:30,850
Maybe we haven't seen it yet.

3012
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:35,030
You mean I'm scared to hold my hand please?

3013
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:35,590
Okay.

3014
02:22:36,190 --> 02:22:38,990
Give me your little quivering baby hand.

3015
02:22:39,550 --> 02:22:40,870
It's so small.

3016
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:45,150
I could fit like five of your hands in my hand.

3017
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:48,550
What'd that do?

3018
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:54,330
It was something timed.

3019
02:22:54,850 --> 02:22:56,350
But I'm not quite sure what.

3020
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:04,590
I'm not quite sure what that does yet.

3021
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,510
Oh.

3022
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:08,770
There's red.

3023
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:09,250
Right there.

3024
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:09,830
Okay.

3025
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:14,410
So do I teleport here?

3026
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,590
No.

3027
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:18,410
Oh!

3028
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:19,190
It turned berserk!

3029
02:23:20,950 --> 02:23:21,690
Look at that.

3030
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:24,170
Will this give me extra health?

3031
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:25,050
No.

3032
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:27,570
I just can't see.

3033
02:23:27,650 --> 02:23:28,110
Daniel!

3034
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:29,630
Thank you for the Hawkeye Super!

3035
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:33,310
I never thought too bad your trip to Japan wasn't very good.

3036
02:23:33,370 --> 02:23:34,750
But here's some funds for the next one.

3037
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:35,630
Hopefully we'll be better.

3038
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,290
Missed you a lot.

3039
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:38,530
Thank you!

3040
02:23:44,390 --> 02:23:45,750
Thank you so much.

3041
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:47,730
I'm getting deja vu.

3042
02:23:49,890 --> 02:23:51,250
I don't know about you.

3043
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:54,250
Gotta wait for that to go back down, right?

3044
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:55,310
Oh.

3045
02:23:55,330 --> 02:23:55,610
There we go.

3046
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:56,190
Like so.

3047
02:23:58,890 --> 02:23:59,330
Okay.

3048
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:00,030
Hmm.

3049
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:04,170
I like how there's like more ambient lighting and everything.

3050
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:04,990
It's pretty fun.

3051
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:08,470
And the music has basically stopped.

3052
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:10,630
Okay.

3053
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,270
Nevermind.

3054
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:12,190
It's back.

3055
02:24:16,750 --> 02:24:17,270
How

3056
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:22,220
do I get to the red over there?

3057
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:27,490
Yeah.

3058
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:28,670
There was this room.

3059
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:29,910
I completely forgot about it.

3060
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:42,480
I don't know.

3061
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:42,860
Do I?

3062
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,440
I'm lost again.

3063
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:47,540
Let's see.

3064
02:24:57,630 --> 02:24:58,030
Wait.

3065
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:59,670
There's a bunch of yellow switches over there.

3066
02:24:59,770 --> 02:25:00,270
Did I not...

3067
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:03,990
Did I not see them before?

3068
02:25:04,250 --> 02:25:04,610
Or...

3069
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:07,650
In here?

3070
02:25:08,310 --> 02:25:08,710
Oh.

3071
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:09,870
I think it's just...

3072
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:12,070
Oh.

3073
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:13,650
They're just showing me what the computers are.

3074
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:14,150
Okay.

3075
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:17,890
You winning, dear Minty?

3076
02:25:17,930 --> 02:25:18,370
I think so.

3077
02:25:19,290 --> 02:25:19,690
Probably.

3078
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:22,730
How do I...

3079
02:25:23,970 --> 02:25:25,450
get up there?

3080
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:28,130
There was like a... I need to get over there.

3081
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:31,530
Because there was a staircase that leads down to the red room.

3082
02:25:44,610 --> 02:25:45,110
Hmm.

3083
02:25:49,890 --> 02:25:51,350
Have you played the other Dooms before?

3084
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:51,770
I have!

3085
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:53,070
I've played one and two before.

3086
02:25:54,650 --> 02:25:57,050
So I'm playing this one before I play three.

3087
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:00,750
It's the Minto guy.

3088
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,630
So teleporter...

3089
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:16,770
Like I don't think...

3090
02:26:16,770 --> 02:26:17,890
I can't go through there, right?

3091
02:26:24,330 --> 02:26:24,810
Nope.

3092
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:25,370
Oh.

3093
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:27,890
And I lost my chance to go through here too.

3094
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:31,450
There's nothing here?

3095
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:31,950
Ugh.

3096
02:26:41,290 --> 02:26:44,050
This blue stuff does hurt me though, right?

3097
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:45,010
I'm not dumb, right?

3098
02:26:48,590 --> 02:26:52,130
Might be a time switch that lets you in with the teleporter.

3099
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:52,770
Oh.

3100
02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:53,690
Three is different.

3101
02:26:53,810 --> 02:26:54,090
Cool.

3102
02:26:54,350 --> 02:26:56,310
But cool and has great spooky atmosphere.

3103
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:57,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3104
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:03,420
Oh.

3105
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:04,680
It doesn't hurt me.

3106
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:08,100
Sorry.

3107
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:10,560
Like I said, it's been a while since I played, you guys.

3108
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:11,000
Okay?

3109
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:14,340
I can't remember what's good and what's against me, okay?

3110
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,740
I just assume everything is...

3111
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:16,100
Oh.

3112
02:27:18,020 --> 02:27:18,460
Oh.

3113
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:21,780
Dang.

3114
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:22,220
Wait.

3115
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,200
Maybe...

3116
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:24,440
Oh!

3117
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:25,340
That must go down!

3118
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:26,300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3119
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:35,380
I just assume everything is against me.

3120
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:38,000
Yay!

3121
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:39,460
Okay.

3122
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:40,860
I figured it out, everybody.

3123
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,140
Ugh.

3124
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,160
Wait, so is this the Hell Knight or is this the Baron?

3125
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:54,580
I can't remember which one's cooler.

3126
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:58,200
Pew!

3127
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:01,400
Weaker is Hell Knight.

3128
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:02,820
What the?

3129
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:12,790
I have to like time it perfectly.

3130
02:28:12,990 --> 02:28:13,450
Maybe.

3131
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:13,830
Oh.

3132
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:16,850
Or not.

3133
02:28:17,310 --> 02:28:17,910
For now.

3134
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:19,550
We'll leave that alone for now.

3135
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:25,810
Is this a trap?

3136
02:28:34,170 --> 02:28:35,530
I just got this blueberry.

3137
02:28:35,730 --> 02:28:36,310
I earned it!

3138
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:42,190
You're not gonna take my health from me!

3139
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:47,390
No, I'm not gonna take it.

3140
02:28:48,130 --> 02:28:54,530
I'm gonna stay here.

3141
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:54,810
Oh, shotgun.

3142
02:28:58,330 --> 02:28:58,970
Oh my god!

3143
02:28:59,210 --> 02:28:59,650
Oh!

3144
02:28:59,650 --> 02:29:00,270
That was close!

3145
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,290
Shoot.

3146
02:29:08,770 --> 02:29:09,210
Okay.

3147
02:29:11,070 --> 02:29:12,210
What the heck is this?

3148
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:13,690
What the heck was that?

3149
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:14,050
What the heck is this?

3150
02:29:14,050 --> 02:29:15,110
What?

3151
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:16,170
What's all these sounds?

3152
02:29:21,210 --> 02:29:21,970
The

3153
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:30,230
gun just disappeared!

3154
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:36,270
The gun reappeared!

3155
02:29:37,630 --> 02:29:40,250
Supercharge is a blueberry hit with the maid magic.

3156
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:54,350
Freaky ghost gun!

3157
02:29:54,730 --> 02:29:55,990
Look at all these switches!

3158
02:29:59,710 --> 02:30:01,710
Okay, first of all though...

3159
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:03,790
I wanna go back to...

3160
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:06,550
Here.

3161
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:09,450
And see if this is possible.

3162
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:12,610
With the right amount of speed.

3163
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:23,420
Wait.

3164
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,680
At some point...

3165
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:29,120
It goes down, it goes...

3166
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:33,240
The yellow key part is a bit BS.

3167
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:39,320
I really skipped on the reload animation for the super shotgun.

3168
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:39,860
It's okay.

3169
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,160
Now it's gonna go back up though.

3170
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:06,660
It doesn't even move!

3171
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:09,500
Thanks for the farm, Gryffindor!

3172
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,680
The solution is on the corridor outside.

3173
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:19,340
Is it now?

3174
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:26,510
I don't mind if you guys give me hints.

3175
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:27,350
Don't worry about it.

3176
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:30,910
Just don't tell me the exact answer.

3177
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:39,220
The

3178
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:46,560
yellow...

3179
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:53,830
Punch it!

3180
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:55,670
Shoot it!

3181
02:31:58,730 --> 02:32:00,450
Wait, so if I go here...

3182
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:06,300
Pop it!

3183
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:08,620
Maybe...

3184
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,920
What it's pointed at.

3185
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,620
The other side.

3186
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:16,820
It's the same marking though.

3187
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:27,310
The fact that there's not even a sound.

3188
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:29,490
It's the most quiet.

3189
02:32:31,810 --> 02:32:32,590
Lick it!

3190
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:36,550
It didn't work.

3191
02:32:57,700 --> 02:32:58,940
Press E on it.

3192
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:02,620
Oh my god, I thought I had.

3193
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,700
I think I hadn't...

3194
02:33:04,700 --> 02:33:05,940
When the...

3195
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:07,140
When the bars were down.

3196
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:07,760
Thank you.

3197
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:14,120
I'm scared of this room.

3198
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:18,580
Let's change the...

3199
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,660
Okay.

3200
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,580
Someone's gonna come down here.

3201
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:28,820
At some point.

3202
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,120
Oh, this is the correct one?

3203
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:39,880
I'm not even pressing some of these.

3204
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:49,310
You failed.

3205
02:33:49,330 --> 02:33:49,710
No gun.

3206
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:50,590
What?

3207
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:52,830
What's the method to this madness?

3208
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:56,490
Is there a way to reset it?

3209
02:33:56,590 --> 02:33:56,770
Or not?

3210
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:08,640
I see, I see.

3211
02:34:10,060 --> 02:34:12,080
But they only give you two shots!

3212
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,680
Two tries to get it?

3213
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:14,120
That's crazy.

3214
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:18,080
No reset, sadly.

3215
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:18,780
That's okay.

3216
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:22,200
I think I... that's the plasma gun, right?

3217
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:22,960
I already have it.

3218
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:24,940
Would have been nice to get the ammo for it, though.

3219
02:34:29,450 --> 02:34:31,590
One to orient yourself, one to act on it.

3220
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:32,490
That's so...

3221
02:34:34,210 --> 02:34:34,610
That's okay.

3222
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:39,210
Alright, we got the blueberry.

3223
02:34:47,670 --> 02:34:48,290
Oh my god.

3224
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:48,770
Ouch!

3225
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:50,830
I was changing my gun, you jerk!

3226
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:55,530
I didn't even know there were still guys out here.

3227
02:34:57,090 --> 02:34:58,670
I thought I blew them all up.

3228
02:34:59,410 --> 02:34:59,690
There's one.

3229
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:02,510
Can I snipe?

3230
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:04,130
Snipe with the shotgun?

3231
02:35:07,710 --> 02:35:08,390
Yes, I can.

3232
02:35:16,370 --> 02:35:16,730
More!

3233
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:18,770
Oh my god, lots!

3234
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:19,490
Uh-oh.

3235
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:20,150
Uh-oh.

3236
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:24,090
Uh-oh.

3237
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:38,790
More rockets, please!

3238
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:40,410
More rockets, please!

3239
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,910
There

3240
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,740
we go!

3241
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:58,740
There we go!

3242
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:05,260
This game is so exciting.

3243
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:08,240
So many things change and move at all times.

3244
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:09,480
What's that?

3245
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:10,680
Oh, energy cell packs.

3246
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:10,980
Nice.

3247
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:18,940
Don't fall.

3248
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:18,960
Aww.

3249
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:23,060
Wait.

3250
02:36:24,910 --> 02:36:25,850
That was the exit!

3251
02:36:26,070 --> 02:36:26,310
Nice!

3252
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:30,610
88% kills.

3253
02:36:31,010 --> 02:36:32,430
88% items.

3254
02:36:32,530 --> 02:36:33,130
Who did I miss?

3255
02:36:33,470 --> 02:36:34,950
50% secrets.

3256
02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:38,090
Entering even simpler.

3257
02:36:43,610 --> 02:36:47,970
You cackle as the familiarity of the situation occurs to you.

3258
02:36:47,970 --> 02:36:51,310
The gateway to the demon's domain was too accessible.

3259
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:54,390
You realize the demons mock you with their invitation.

3260
02:36:54,890 --> 02:36:56,210
It does not matter.

3261
02:36:56,350 --> 02:36:58,670
The demons spawn like rats.

3262
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:03,530
And you have the great AAA UAC poison they crave.

3263
02:37:03,850 --> 02:37:07,750
Your bloodthirsty scream shatters the teleport haze.

3264
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:10,650
Once again, you find yourself amidst...

3265
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:11,550
...

3266
02:37:11,550 --> 02:37:12,230
...

3267
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,730
amidstt...

3268
02:37:14,730 --> 02:37:15,310
...

3269
02:37:22,190 --> 02:37:22,950
Saving the game.

3270
02:37:24,450 --> 02:37:25,530
Saving the game.

3271
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:29,470
I keep thinking that Each level is called, bring it on.

3272
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:30,910
Ohhh!

3273
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:34,710
What the hell is that?!

3274
02:37:34,710 --> 02:37:35,270
Oh my god!

3275
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:36,390
Ok.

3276
02:37:36,610 --> 02:37:37,190
Oh cold!

3277
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:38,350
Cold Cold Cold Cold!

3278
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:40,410
Fire Fire Fire Fire!

3279
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:49,190
Am I even hitting him?

3280
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:49,830
I don't even know.

3281
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:01,930
Got him.

3282
02:38:02,830 --> 02:38:03,570
Oh my god.

3283
02:38:03,630 --> 02:38:04,070
There's more?

3284
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:06,790
You.

3285
02:38:07,250 --> 02:38:08,030
You bitch.

3286
02:38:08,490 --> 02:38:09,270
You bitch!

3287
02:38:14,050 --> 02:38:15,390
Please die already!

3288
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:26,430
Die!

3289
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:27,810
Oh my god, there's so many!

3290
02:38:30,890 --> 02:38:31,550
Coco Demon!

3291
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:33,890
Die, Coco Demon!

3292
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:35,350
Die, Coco Demon!

3293
02:38:35,550 --> 02:38:36,630
Why do you have so much health?

3294
02:38:48,510 --> 02:38:48,970
Okay.

3295
02:38:56,010 --> 02:38:57,950
This is where the game gets real.

3296
02:38:58,930 --> 02:38:59,810
I can tell.

3297
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:03,210
Nice!

3298
02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:06,010
Oh, hello.

3299
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:09,390
Are you stuck in here, or...?

3300
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:20,620
Oh my god!

3301
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:21,500
Where did you go from?

3302
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:29,520
Oh, there's a blue... a green berry!

3303
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:36,170
Box of Rockets, nice.

3304
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:38,690
Oh my gosh, I can't see because of the...

3305
02:39:39,390 --> 02:39:40,450
corpse of the Coco Demon.

3306
02:39:42,830 --> 02:39:43,950
Yeah, fight each other!

3307
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:47,450
Oh, I thought you were dead.

3308
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:50,690
They just won't stop spawning.

3309
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:51,790
Is this just like a...

3310
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:54,010
one of those maps where I just hold out and like...

3311
02:39:54,010 --> 02:39:54,970
hope that I don't die?

3312
02:39:58,430 --> 02:40:01,230
Can you make chocolate out of a Coco Demon?

3313
02:40:01,650 --> 02:40:02,090
Yeah.

3314
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:03,190
Probably.

3315
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:06,690
I think it would taste a little bitter.

3316
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,610
Oh, blueberry.

3317
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:11,350
Pretty much, yes.

3318
02:40:11,550 --> 02:40:11,770
Okay.

3319
02:40:17,410 --> 02:40:19,070
Why is it so yellow?

3320
02:40:26,410 --> 02:40:27,870
Oh, there they come.

3321
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:40,660
What was that sound?

3322
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:42,520
Tink, tink, tink, tink.

3323
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:48,080
Metal soundtrack, the foreboding ambiance.

3324
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:48,880
I know, right?

3325
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:50,740
Like, it's...

3326
02:40:50,740 --> 02:40:54,140
The change in atmosphere is actually really...

3327
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:54,820
crazy.

3328
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:03,500
Holy moly.

3329
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:08,840
Let's see.

3330
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:12,140
I feel like I can't read chat very much because I'm like...

3331
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:13,360
just waiting for the next spawn.

3332
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,540
The next wave to...

3333
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:17,260
What the?

3334
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:17,860
What are these?

3335
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:19,500
What the hell are these?

3336
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,940
Oh, those are those metal sounds I was hearing.

3337
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,760
The clink, clink, clink, clink.

3338
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:28,220
Ah, okay, okay.

3339
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:35,160
Are they attached to a...

3340
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:36,180
a guy?

3341
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:38,600
Exit?

3342
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:41,160
Is it chat?

3343
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:42,520
Is this real?

3344
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:45,440
Chat?

3345
02:41:46,360 --> 02:41:47,520
Is this real?

3346
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,420
Hm, yes.

3347
02:41:58,280 --> 02:42:00,260
Those deal way more damage than you expect.

3348
02:42:00,380 --> 02:42:01,500
I'm glad I avoided it then.

3349
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:02,100
Holy cow.

3350
02:42:09,890 --> 02:42:10,490
Oh.

3351
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:11,710
Oh, I should...

3352
02:42:11,710 --> 02:42:12,010
Wait.

3353
02:42:13,330 --> 02:42:14,190
Go through.

3354
02:42:14,870 --> 02:42:15,450
Oh!

3355
02:42:21,070 --> 02:42:21,670
Yippee!

3356
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:29,700
Yippee!

3357
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:33,220
Invulnerability wasted.

3358
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:34,840
I wouldn't have used it.

3359
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,040
I wouldn't have been able to use it anyway.

3360
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:38,120
Entering the bleeding.

3361
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:43,560
Ooh, carpet.

3362
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:46,680
Yucky.

3363
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:49,460
The doors are really special though.

3364
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:55,360
I like the parts when we, like, leave the ship and actually enter hell, you know?

3365
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:57,160
Oh, chainsaw.

3366
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:00,080
I got it back!

3367
02:43:00,820 --> 02:43:02,280
I got it back after all.

3368
02:43:07,780 --> 02:43:09,360
Maybe I'll go to the shoddy.

3369
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:12,140
Shoddy, yoddy, yoddy, yoddy.

3370
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:15,680
Shoddy, yoddy, yoddy, yoddy.

3371
02:43:18,890 --> 02:43:19,690
Plasma gun!

3372
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:23,750
Oh, goodbye!

3373
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:27,730
I hear someone.

3374
02:43:28,090 --> 02:43:29,130
I hear someone.

3375
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:33,810
Trying to, like, see if I can snipe them from up here.

3376
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:35,010
Trying to, like, see if I can snipe them from up here.

3377
02:43:35,010 --> 02:43:35,510
But I can't.

3378
02:43:37,170 --> 02:43:37,730
Save.

3379
02:43:37,810 --> 02:43:38,470
Oh, okay.

3380
02:43:41,390 --> 02:43:42,150
I'll save.

3381
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:55,020
What the hell?

3382
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:57,280
Shabap, shabap.

3383
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:00,140
Shabap, shabap.

3384
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:06,280
I don't wanna go berserker.

3385
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,440
Secret item.

3386
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:11,260
Where am I hearing them from though?

3387
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:14,500
I want the upper hand!

3388
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:16,140
But I don't think I will have it.

3389
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:17,500
Oh well.

3390
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,000
Oh!

3391
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:21,760
Pickle pop hepburn!

3392
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:28,210
That was down though, wasn't it?

3393
02:44:28,210 --> 02:44:28,490
Just now?

3394
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:32,550
Guess this one's a little bit linear.

3395
02:44:37,970 --> 02:44:38,750
Oh, my god!

3396
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:41,590
They were on top of each other, so I didn't even notice them.

3397
02:44:42,690 --> 02:44:43,510
Did I kill him?

3398
02:44:44,110 --> 02:44:44,510
Yeah.

3399
02:44:45,710 --> 02:44:46,110
Oh!

3400
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:46,510
Whoa.

3401
02:44:47,050 --> 02:44:47,450
Whoa.

3402
02:44:48,170 --> 02:44:48,570
Whoa.

3403
02:44:48,570 --> 02:44:50,590
Everything moves in this game.

3404
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:51,550
It's kinda crazy.

3405
02:44:59,910 --> 02:45:00,470
Yeah.

3406
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:01,050
Yeah.

3407
02:45:01,150 --> 02:45:01,410
Yeah.

3408
02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:04,730
Let's get the other one.

3409
02:45:04,910 --> 02:45:05,590
This one.

3410
02:45:08,190 --> 02:45:08,750
Oh!

3411
02:45:08,890 --> 02:45:11,610
I noticed you.

3412
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:12,830
It does go down.

3413
02:45:13,470 --> 02:45:14,310
But when?

3414
02:45:15,390 --> 02:45:17,090
Did I miss my opportunity?

3415
02:45:21,450 --> 02:45:22,630
Oh, I don't need it.

3416
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:24,490
Okay, but we know it's there.

3417
02:45:24,570 --> 02:45:25,030
We know it's there.

3418
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:25,550
We know it's there.

3419
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:30,540
Yeah!

3420
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:35,420
Where's all the guys?

3421
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:37,800
Not that I'm complaining.

3422
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:38,280
Oh!

3423
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:39,040
Whoa!

3424
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:42,420
There's all the guys.

3425
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:53,620
Devil switch.

3426
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:55,740
Pull my devil trigger.

3427
02:46:04,190 --> 02:46:05,550
Imps are so funny.

3428
02:46:05,730 --> 02:46:05,890
Oh!

3429
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:07,890
Lots of pinkies.

3430
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:10,850
Oh.

3431
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:11,510
Oh, that guy.

3432
02:46:11,830 --> 02:46:12,270
Oh, man.

3433
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:15,810
What's a good one?

3434
02:46:16,330 --> 02:46:16,990
Maybe...

3435
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,630
Rocket launch him.

3436
02:46:19,510 --> 02:46:20,170
Ow!

3437
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:29,160
No!

3438
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:30,980
No!

3439
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:34,420
Oh

3440
02:46:37,900 --> 02:46:38,460
my god.

3441
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:39,240
Where'd you go?

3442
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:40,080
Pinky?

3443
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:43,240
There.

3444
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:45,460
Oh.

3445
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:47,520
Got him.

3446
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:49,340
I got him.

3447
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:50,500
I got him.

3448
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:51,920
Oh my god.

3449
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:52,600
Oh, there's another one.

3450
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:56,480
And one more.

3451
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:58,760
And another one.

3452
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:00,080
Where is he?

3453
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:08,560
You are not TF2 soldier.

3454
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:09,540
What does that even mean?

3455
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:12,580
I don't even know what that means.

3456
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:14,700
I don't even know what that means.

3457
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:18,100
I've never played Team Fortress.

3458
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,860
Did I get everybody?

3459
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:24,860
Am I safe to jump down?

3460
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:29,300
Well, I said safe as, you know, face rocket attacks things.

3461
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,820
Why am I such an idiot me?

3462
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:35,340
Why am I such an idiot me?

3463
02:47:40,730 --> 02:47:43,150
Why do I always take a rocket to the face?

3464
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:43,690
Why do I always take a rocket to the face?

3465
02:47:43,690 --> 02:47:43,810
Why do I always take a rocket to the face?

3466
02:47:44,670 --> 02:47:45,650
Oh, I hear more.

3467
02:47:45,870 --> 02:47:47,170
I think over there though.

3468
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:50,510
I think I want more shotgun shells.

3469
02:47:50,650 --> 02:47:50,870
I think I want more shotgun shells.

3470
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:51,890
I'll take the clips too though.

3471
02:47:53,410 --> 02:47:53,890
Shotgun.

3472
02:47:57,250 --> 02:47:58,010
Oh, okay.

3473
02:47:58,390 --> 02:47:58,410
Oh, okay.

3474
02:47:59,190 --> 02:47:59,930
That's here.

3475
02:48:00,130 --> 02:48:03,250
Look at this trap.

3476
02:48:03,470 --> 02:48:05,210
If this was never a trap to be...

3477
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:06,550
If this was a trap of...

3478
02:48:07,770 --> 02:48:09,090
Before, I would still know that this is a trap.

3479
02:48:14,890 --> 02:48:16,090
Is there anything else?

3480
02:48:16,390 --> 02:48:17,790
I'm trying to look for any...

3481
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:20,570
There's this room.

3482
02:48:22,090 --> 02:48:22,530
Blueberry.

3483
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:25,910
Oh, I hear them.

3484
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:27,750
I hear them growling.

3485
02:48:32,970 --> 02:48:33,990
Where are you guys?

3486
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:37,650
Oh my god, please.

3487
02:48:37,870 --> 02:48:38,290
Oh my god.

3488
02:48:39,050 --> 02:48:40,490
Yo, that's so unfair.

3489
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:46,730
That's so unfair.

3490
02:48:48,490 --> 02:48:49,590
That's so unfair.

3491
02:48:53,550 --> 02:48:56,090
Alright, I gotta stop being a little baby.

3492
02:48:59,870 --> 02:49:00,430
Alright,

3493
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:03,970
I gotta stop being a little baby.

3494
02:49:03,970 --> 02:49:04,670
I need lifestyles.

3495
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:05,670
Hell yeah.

3496
02:49:10,430 --> 02:49:11,450
What is that key?

3497
02:49:14,210 --> 02:49:14,770
Hello?

3498
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:17,330
Can you stop...

3499
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:19,850
Can you like...

3500
02:49:19,850 --> 02:49:22,390
Stop roaring and...

3501
02:49:24,570 --> 02:49:26,230
I think it was those guys, right?

3502
02:49:28,450 --> 02:49:29,430
There's a few more.

3503
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:31,450
I thought we had peace and quiet.

3504
02:49:33,970 --> 02:49:35,490
Oh my god, you guys are so annoying.

3505
02:49:39,670 --> 02:49:41,490
Oh, it's the pinkies.

3506
02:49:49,990 --> 02:49:50,750
There's a pinky.

3507
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:53,370
Okay, we need the yellow key.

3508
02:49:57,370 --> 02:49:57,810
Cool.

3509
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:00,470
Easy.

3510
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:02,230
I really want the blueberry.

3511
02:50:04,030 --> 02:50:05,370
Should I risk it for the biscuit?

3512
02:50:06,650 --> 02:50:07,870
No peace and quiet.

3513
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:08,750
Only busting.

3514
02:50:09,130 --> 02:50:10,050
You're so right.

3515
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:10,590
Look at these.

3516
02:50:12,970 --> 02:50:14,830
At the place, when I went to...

3517
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:16,790
My sister got married last year.

3518
02:50:17,690 --> 02:50:25,530
And when I went to her wedding, the place that she got married at had all these little demon gremlin statues that looked like this.

3519
02:50:25,870 --> 02:50:27,610
That was so unserious.

3520
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:32,210
Risk it for the biscuit.

3521
02:50:32,210 --> 02:50:34,210
Risk it for the biscuit.

3522
02:50:34,210 --> 02:50:35,330
Yeah, yeah.

3523
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:38,750
What's gonna come out, I wonder?

3524
02:50:39,610 --> 02:50:40,070
What's gonna come out, I wonder?

3525
02:50:40,070 --> 02:50:40,910
We'll do the chain gun.

3526
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:46,240
What?

3527
02:51:02,810 --> 02:51:05,050
I'm so glad I risked it for the biscuit.

3528
02:51:05,390 --> 02:51:05,450
I'm so glad I risked it for the biscuit.

3529
02:51:08,610 --> 02:51:08,830
Yippee!

3530
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:13,010
Now they're messing with you.

3531
02:51:13,370 --> 02:51:14,330
I know, right?

3532
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:14,950
Oh!

3533
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:17,710
I didn't conceal this armor before either.

3534
02:51:18,050 --> 02:51:18,610
Nice.

3535
02:51:20,370 --> 02:51:21,530
Wait, am I full on shotgun?

3536
02:51:22,610 --> 02:51:23,210
Seriously?

3537
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:23,810
Wow.

3538
02:51:26,470 --> 02:51:27,070
Okay.

3539
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:29,990
It was up here.

3540
02:51:30,730 --> 02:51:32,130
And around the corner.

3541
02:51:33,270 --> 02:51:34,550
And through here.

3542
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:35,710
Yellow.

3543
02:51:41,420 --> 02:51:42,780
What's that gun over there?

3544
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:45,560
I don't think I've picked that one up yet.

3545
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:47,760
Come here, pancake!

3546
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,960
Can't believe Mint's sister married Vlad Dracula.

3547
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:59,420
Oh wait, I can touch this, can't I?

3548
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:00,240
This is just water.

3549
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:03,360
I'm stronger than you.

3550
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:04,140
What is this?

3551
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:16,110
Ah!

3552
02:52:28,330 --> 02:52:30,110
Am I moving with the water?

3553
02:52:30,330 --> 02:52:31,070
Oh, I am.

3554
02:52:33,090 --> 02:52:34,230
That was pretty nice.

3555
02:52:43,350 --> 02:52:44,870
Is he gonna attack me?

3556
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:21,420
Eventually he will be able to get me.

3557
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:30,000
No secret behind the water.

3558
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:31,320
What kind of game is this?

3559
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:36,680
Atlantis no nazo statue is on the last floor.

3560
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:43,460
Hold up.

3561
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:44,920
Press that.

3562
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:47,380
Where does this go to?

3563
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:50,740
Oh!

3564
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:51,960
Buck at the top.

3565
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:52,580
Okay.

3566
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:55,060
Where the...

3567
02:53:55,060 --> 02:53:55,700
Where the...

3568
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:55,780
Where the...

3569
02:53:55,800 --> 02:53:56,700
Oh, okay.

3570
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:02,740
What did that do?

3571
02:54:05,700 --> 02:54:06,220
Oh!

3572
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:10,140
I thought it said a box of spells for a second.

3573
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:10,800
I was like...

3574
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:13,740
Wow, we got the...

3575
02:54:15,440 --> 02:54:15,960
Oh!

3576
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:18,480
I got the BFG!

3577
02:54:22,380 --> 02:54:23,940
I didn't mean to shoot it twice.

3578
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:24,800
But...

3579
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:25,940
I guess that worked.

3580
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:29,020
Wait, which one is that?

3581
02:54:29,640 --> 02:54:30,120
Seven?

3582
02:54:30,620 --> 02:54:31,100
Seven.

3583
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:33,320
The BFG, baby!

3584
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:35,600
Okay.

3585
02:54:35,880 --> 02:54:37,000
Well, we pressed...

3586
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:39,180
The one over here.

3587
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:41,180
So let's go back and see what has changed.

3588
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:44,340
What is going to try and kill me now out here?

3589
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:48,960
I'll check from up above.

3590
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:49,620
Wait.

3591
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:50,660
Okay.

3592
02:54:53,460 --> 02:54:55,780
I'm waiting for those damn spiders.

3593
02:54:57,740 --> 02:54:58,380
I'm waiting for those damn spiders.

3594
02:54:58,380 --> 02:54:59,220
As soon as I hear the...

3595
02:54:59,220 --> 02:54:59,820
As soon as I hear the...

3596
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:02,500
You...

3597
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:04,020
You're not as...

3598
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:05,360
You're not as nice.

3599
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:07,380
Big freaky gun.

3600
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,600
What does BFG stand for?

3601
02:55:09,700 --> 02:55:10,880
Bustin' Feels Good!

3602
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:15,120
Yeah.

3603
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:17,180
Wait, where...

3604
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:18,640
What did that change at all now?

3605
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,640
I pressed the switch.

3606
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:22,940
And, um...

3607
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:28,320
Oh my gosh.

3608
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:30,820
Ugh.

3609
02:55:34,580 --> 02:55:35,840
I could plasma him.

3610
02:55:41,140 --> 02:55:42,460
Hey, what a way!

3611
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,660
You stopped my...

3612
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:44,860
My ammo.

3613
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:44,940
My ammo.

3614
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:55,140
Just stay right there.

3615
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:02,960
EMP!

3616
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:10,840
Where all you guys come from?

3617
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:13,540
Shuba Shuba.

3618
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:19,320
Shuba Shuba.

3619
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:21,100
In my head they're saying Shuba Shuba.

3620
02:56:23,780 --> 02:56:24,720
Shuba Shuba.

3621
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:28,140
Bustin' Feels Good.

3622
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:31,820
Makes me feel good.

3623
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:33,200
It feels good.

3624
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:41,740
I wanted him to get nice and close.

3625
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:43,500
The exit!

3626
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:44,980
Wait.

3627
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:46,580
But...

3628
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:49,460
Have I gotten every guy in here?

3629
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,560
I wanna make sure I've killed everything.

3630
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:57,140
No demons left behind.

3631
02:56:58,060 --> 02:57:00,420
No demons left behind.

3632
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:00,840
No demons left behind.

3633
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:01,300
Is this a secret?

3634
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:02,900
Oh no.

3635
02:57:04,660 --> 02:57:06,060
I hear nothing alive.

3636
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:07,240
But sometimes there's sneak.

3637
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:08,160
You know.

3638
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:12,080
Sometimes you can't hear them until you're right up on them.

3639
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:14,400
But it's true, I don't hear anything else.

3640
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:16,860
I do not hear...

3641
02:57:16,860 --> 02:57:18,300
Any other...

3642
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:19,260
Noises.

3643
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:27,210
Oh, that's health.

3644
02:57:28,150 --> 02:57:28,670
Okay.

3645
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:30,450
Guess I'll leave.

3646
02:57:35,610 --> 02:57:37,550
Watch it say 95%...

3647
02:57:37,550 --> 02:57:37,610
Oh!

3648
02:57:37,690 --> 02:57:38,110
Yippee!

3649
02:57:40,490 --> 02:57:41,770
96%!

3650
02:57:42,410 --> 02:57:43,950
42% secret.

3651
02:57:44,850 --> 02:57:46,030
Terror Core!

3652
02:57:50,650 --> 02:57:51,330
Ooh.

3653
02:57:52,690 --> 02:57:53,370
Ooh.

3654
02:57:53,610 --> 02:57:54,670
Thank you.

3655
02:57:55,130 --> 02:57:56,190
Let's save the game.

3656
02:57:58,050 --> 02:57:59,070
Level 11.

3657
02:57:59,370 --> 02:58:01,270
Wait, how many did you guys say there was?

3658
02:58:01,550 --> 02:58:01,830
30?

3659
02:58:02,290 --> 02:58:04,370
Maybe I'll stop at 15.

3660
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:07,970
I'm feeling okay, but...

3661
02:58:09,530 --> 02:58:10,470
What was that?

3662
02:58:13,410 --> 02:58:13,810
Ooh.

3663
02:58:15,070 --> 02:58:16,630
There's thunder now and everything.

3664
02:58:17,970 --> 02:58:18,370
Scary.

3665
02:58:22,610 --> 02:58:23,530
Where you behind here?

3666
02:58:23,730 --> 02:58:24,410
Oh, blue key.

3667
02:58:28,190 --> 02:58:29,930
Yeah, cause I totally want to go in there.

3668
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:32,310
They're making it really enticing.

3669
02:58:32,370 --> 02:58:32,650
You know?

3670
02:58:33,310 --> 02:58:35,610
They're making it really enticing to want to go in there.

3671
02:58:36,150 --> 02:58:37,630
I hear a lot going on.

3672
02:58:37,930 --> 02:58:38,570
It's just...

3673
02:58:38,570 --> 02:58:38,810
Yeah.

3674
02:58:39,230 --> 02:58:40,470
That one clip complains a lot.

3675
02:58:44,730 --> 02:58:46,790
It's just like...

3676
02:58:53,870 --> 02:58:54,710
I'm not gonna go in there.

3677
02:58:54,730 --> 02:58:55,850
I'm gonna go in there.

3678
02:58:55,850 --> 02:58:56,350
Are you sure?

3679
02:58:56,350 --> 02:58:56,370
I'm not sure.

3680
02:58:56,370 --> 02:58:56,430
I'm not sure.

3681
02:58:56,450 --> 02:58:56,730
It's just...

3682
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,970
I'm not sure.

3683
02:58:57,970 --> 02:58:58,030
I don't think I can do it.

3684
02:58:58,030 --> 02:58:58,970
I'm not sure.

3685
02:58:58,990 --> 02:58:59,130
I'm not sure.

3686
02:59:12,770 --> 02:59:14,390
I think I'm doing it right.

3687
02:59:14,450 --> 02:59:15,070
I think I'm doing it right.

3688
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:25,130
Oh, okay, never mind.

3689
02:59:25,310 --> 02:59:28,530
I think it raises and... Oh, okay.

3690
02:59:29,170 --> 02:59:30,450
It'll fall eventually.

3691
02:59:31,590 --> 02:59:32,410
There we go.

3692
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:40,350
25 regular levels, 4 secret levels, and 3 fun levels.

3693
02:59:40,590 --> 02:59:42,470
That can only be accessed through the passwords.

3694
02:59:42,470 --> 02:59:44,410
Oh, thank you.

3695
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:45,110
Thank you, thank you.

3696
02:59:49,970 --> 02:59:50,450
Hello.

3697
02:59:51,150 --> 02:59:53,710
I hear them, but they don't... they're too afraid of me.

3698
02:59:54,970 --> 02:59:55,870
A boogie.

3699
03:00:00,350 --> 03:00:00,870
It's me.

3700
03:00:01,050 --> 03:00:02,150
Actually, I'm afraid of them.

3701
03:00:10,630 --> 03:00:11,590
It's so wet.

3702
03:00:13,450 --> 03:00:13,930
Why?

3703
03:00:15,210 --> 03:00:16,750
Why is it so wet?

3704
03:00:22,880 --> 03:00:23,840
Squishy.

3705
03:00:35,900 --> 03:00:36,380
Almost

3706
03:00:46,970 --> 03:00:48,170
had him.

3707
03:00:48,890 --> 03:00:50,210
Got him.

3708
03:00:59,360 --> 03:00:59,840
Dummies!

3709
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:04,620
I am getting them, right?

3710
03:01:05,500 --> 03:01:06,020
Yeah.

3711
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:18,440
Two slime, four demons.

3712
03:01:19,180 --> 03:01:22,040
Ghost brain higher than demon brain.

3713
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:27,020
Actually, is that...

3714
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:30,480
I'm afraid.

3715
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:32,240
I'm afraid of the splash damage.

3716
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:34,920
I think I got one guy down.

3717
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:36,460
Come here.

3718
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:37,820
No, I did not.

3719
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,320
Oh, there was one guy down.

3720
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:49,040
I don't want to keep using my shotgun shells because I was running low.

3721
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:50,820
There's a box right here.

3722
03:01:52,780 --> 03:01:53,840
I say low.

3723
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,200
I said, like, 50s.

3724
03:01:55,320 --> 03:01:58,140
But I use two at a time, so it's like...

3725
03:01:59,060 --> 03:02:00,000
There we go.

3726
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:07,600
I pressed a demon button.

3727
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:11,980
Does a whole lot of demon nothing.

3728
03:02:22,520 --> 03:02:25,100
You can switch to the normal shotgun by pressing three again.

3729
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:25,560
Oh, really?

3730
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:27,100
Oh, this goes down.

3731
03:02:27,440 --> 03:02:27,560
Okay.

3732
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:28,960
Hello?

3733
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:30,900
Oh.

3734
03:02:34,460 --> 03:02:35,480
Just gonna...

3735
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:37,200
Oh.

3736
03:02:37,260 --> 03:02:37,580
Oh.

3737
03:02:37,580 --> 03:02:37,660
Oh.

3738
03:02:39,640 --> 03:02:40,460
Come on, aim.

3739
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:42,900
I don't feel like dealing with you.

3740
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:47,080
Should I ever consider playing MyHouse.

3741
03:02:47,180 --> 03:02:48,960
Oh, I know MyHouse!

3742
03:02:49,140 --> 03:02:51,020
It's my little mod with lots of doomcute.

3743
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:52,520
Also, please don't make fun of my name.

3744
03:02:52,540 --> 03:02:53,660
My parents don't like me.

3745
03:02:57,180 --> 03:03:01,220
Well, I wasn't gonna make fun of it until you said something.

3746
03:03:04,060 --> 03:03:07,180
I'm not gonna make fun of you until you tell me not to make fun of you.

3747
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:08,500
Oh.

3748
03:03:08,980 --> 03:03:09,420
Oh.

3749
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:11,300
Oh gosh.

3750
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:16,000
I'm so glad I can see these guys.

3751
03:03:17,300 --> 03:03:18,200
Where's the other one?

3752
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:19,560
Where are you?

3753
03:03:20,040 --> 03:03:20,480
Oh!

3754
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:23,840
I think I got him.

3755
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:28,240
Armor?

3756
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:32,300
What if we ask you to make fun of us?

3757
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:32,600
What then?

3758
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:34,180
Um...

3759
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:35,420
Then it's no fun.

3760
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:36,400
I mean...

3761
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:36,720
I don't know.

3762
03:03:36,780 --> 03:03:38,100
This has got to be like a balance, right?

3763
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:41,720
What's that sound?

3764
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:42,560
OK.

3765
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:44,680
I will come back here.

3766
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:46,300
Eventually.

3767
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:48,240
Probably.

3768
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,140
I have not gone to this side.

3769
03:03:56,060 --> 03:03:56,540
Wait.

3770
03:03:56,540 --> 03:03:57,500
I'm guessing... OK.

3771
03:03:58,080 --> 03:03:58,560
Run!

3772
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:04,400
I would hate it if you made fun of me.

3773
03:04:05,340 --> 03:04:05,820
Totally.

3774
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:08,080
Oh, I don't even need this.

3775
03:04:08,720 --> 03:04:09,800
I'm such an idiot.

3776
03:04:11,800 --> 03:04:12,520
Red key.

3777
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:15,300
This is where we came from.

3778
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:15,900
Yes.

3779
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:16,220
OK.

3780
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:18,760
Where do I go?

3781
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:22,940
I'm full on rockets.

3782
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:24,200
I'm full on a lot of stuff.

3783
03:04:24,460 --> 03:04:26,560
Actually, the most I think I need is...

3784
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:29,900
is shotgun shells.

3785
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:32,300
But I'm not low.

3786
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:37,000
Hmm.

3787
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:39,240
I would totally hate it.

3788
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:39,900
Why would you?

3789
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,920
You guys then will use it against me.

3790
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,480
If I make fun of you, you'll be like...

3791
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:45,320
She hates us!

3792
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:49,660
If I make fun of you, then you'll be like...

3793
03:04:49,660 --> 03:04:51,900
She really hates us!

3794
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:56,120
You'd be so sad.

3795
03:05:02,590 --> 03:05:04,470
Just pressing everything that I can.

3796
03:05:04,770 --> 03:05:05,290
Just...

3797
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:07,670
Just roofing every wall that's possible.

3798
03:05:09,890 --> 03:05:11,750
Prove that you don't hate us, then.

3799
03:05:12,870 --> 03:05:14,110
How can I prove that?

3800
03:05:14,310 --> 03:05:14,350
Oh.

3801
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:16,030
Oh, I found...

3802
03:05:16,030 --> 03:05:17,170
I found a blueberry.

3803
03:05:18,730 --> 03:05:20,330
What do you want me to do to...

3804
03:05:22,330 --> 03:05:23,950
to prove this to you?

3805
03:05:24,850 --> 03:05:25,810
I'll show you.

3806
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:43,030
You son of a...

3807
03:05:49,050 --> 03:05:50,430
I think I got him.

3808
03:05:50,890 --> 03:05:51,410
Yeah.

3809
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:52,370
Loser.

3810
03:05:52,590 --> 03:05:53,850
Oh, there's a key over there.

3811
03:05:55,830 --> 03:05:57,110
Yo, they were cheating.

3812
03:05:57,350 --> 03:05:57,710
They were!

3813
03:05:59,510 --> 03:06:00,330
Yellow key.

3814
03:06:01,330 --> 03:06:01,850
Okay.

3815
03:06:02,190 --> 03:06:03,750
Will this lower that key?

3816
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:05,430
For me?

3817
03:06:05,430 --> 03:06:06,270
No.

3818
03:06:09,650 --> 03:06:10,910
What's this go...

3819
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:12,010
Oh!

3820
03:06:12,250 --> 03:06:13,130
Look at that.

3821
03:06:14,250 --> 03:06:14,890
Nice.

3822
03:06:16,090 --> 03:06:17,490
Can I shoot this?

3823
03:06:18,390 --> 03:06:18,930
Oh.

3824
03:06:21,190 --> 03:06:21,510
Nope.

3825
03:06:22,230 --> 03:06:23,150
Just like Doom 2.

3826
03:06:26,090 --> 03:06:28,070
This game is so evil!

3827
03:06:28,670 --> 03:06:30,570
I know you don't hate us.

3828
03:06:30,990 --> 03:06:31,630
Really?

3829
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:32,510
Really?

3830
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:32,670
Really?

3831
03:06:34,170 --> 03:06:36,190
I'm not doing my job well enough, then.

3832
03:06:38,910 --> 03:06:40,750
I need to try harder.

3833
03:06:42,550 --> 03:06:42,990
Where...

3834
03:06:42,990 --> 03:06:43,990
Where was that?

3835
03:06:44,130 --> 03:06:44,490
In here?

3836
03:06:46,650 --> 03:06:47,090
Here.

3837
03:06:47,730 --> 03:06:48,910
Was there anything else here?

3838
03:06:50,650 --> 03:06:53,050
I think I hear another one probably on the other side.

3839
03:06:53,850 --> 03:06:54,410
Oh, yeah.

3840
03:06:54,450 --> 03:06:55,610
Because there's a blueberry here.

3841
03:06:57,170 --> 03:06:58,150
How do I...

3842
03:06:58,150 --> 03:06:58,850
Hmm...

3843
03:07:00,010 --> 03:07:01,470
How do I get this blueberry?

3844
03:07:03,470 --> 03:07:04,410
Let's try the other side.

3845
03:07:04,790 --> 03:07:05,190
Oh.

3846
03:07:05,570 --> 03:07:05,970
Wait...

3847
03:07:05,970 --> 03:07:06,670
Where the hell am I?

3848
03:07:11,930 --> 03:07:12,330
Hmm...

3849
03:07:12,970 --> 03:07:13,630
Oh, here?

3850
03:07:16,050 --> 03:07:17,250
How do I get to it?

3851
03:07:20,210 --> 03:07:22,390
Can't wait for you to go on your hater training arc.

3852
03:07:25,670 --> 03:07:26,530
I'm a hater.

3853
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:28,990
That's me.

3854
03:07:30,710 --> 03:07:31,110
Umm...

3855
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:37,390
Where... where... do I go?

3856
03:07:40,950 --> 03:07:42,970
I'm gonna keep the chaingun up.

3857
03:07:51,560 --> 03:07:53,300
Well, okay, we got the yellow key.

3858
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:55,500
That's all we need for now.

3859
03:07:55,700 --> 03:07:57,020
It's okay if I can't get to it.

3860
03:07:59,140 --> 03:08:03,220
Which... yellow door was... this is red door.

3861
03:08:03,480 --> 03:08:04,420
Yellow door.

3862
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:08,040
Oh, this map.

3863
03:08:11,860 --> 03:08:12,600
Raiders?

3864
03:08:12,700 --> 03:08:13,100
Hello!

3865
03:08:13,300 --> 03:08:14,940
Thank you for the raid!

3866
03:08:15,480 --> 03:08:16,520
Right back, thanks for the gift!

3867
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:17,980
Who raided me?

3868
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:20,660
Hello!

3869
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:22,800
Thank you!

3870
03:08:22,940 --> 03:08:24,260
I'm playing Doom.

3871
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:26,000
Doom...

3872
03:08:28,550 --> 03:08:29,660
Doom 64.

3873
03:08:30,980 --> 03:08:33,260
From the Nintendo 64.

3874
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:34,700
Maybe I'm hearing this.

3875
03:08:38,910 --> 03:08:41,190
Where was the other yellow door though?

3876
03:08:41,830 --> 03:08:43,130
Guys, I'm so lost.

3877
03:08:45,690 --> 03:08:46,130
VGI!

3878
03:08:46,370 --> 03:08:47,030
Thanks for the gift!

3879
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:53,700
Is... is that it?

3880
03:08:54,020 --> 03:08:55,160
I'm so lost.

3881
03:08:55,720 --> 03:08:56,780
I'm so lost.

3882
03:08:56,820 --> 03:08:57,740
I don't know where to go.

3883
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:03,480
Red door.

3884
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,000
Okay.

3885
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:05,820
Oh, that scared me.

3886
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:08,020
Up, I think.

3887
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:09,760
I'm trying to see... okay.

3888
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:11,000
I'm just gonna follow a map.

3889
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:13,760
We know that we've killed most of the guys in this area, so...

3890
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:16,360
Why is this map so...

3891
03:09:17,560 --> 03:09:18,360
You know...

3892
03:09:19,900 --> 03:09:20,300
Why?

3893
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:22,100
Okay, let's queue.

3894
03:09:22,820 --> 03:09:23,720
Let's queue out.

3895
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:25,820
Where am I supposed to go?

3896
03:09:32,980 --> 03:09:34,040
Ducky, thank you for the gift!

3897
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:35,460
Simba, welcome back!

3898
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:37,380
You hate us, so you think about us, right?

3899
03:09:37,640 --> 03:09:38,880
Oh, that's... that's...

3900
03:09:39,940 --> 03:09:41,300
That's the logic we're using.

3901
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,280
Upstairs in those catwalks.

3902
03:09:46,300 --> 03:09:46,480
Okay.

3903
03:09:53,550 --> 03:09:54,350
So, up in here.

3904
03:09:58,530 --> 03:09:58,910
Up in here?

3905
03:10:05,910 --> 03:10:06,770
No, I pressed that.

3906
03:10:07,530 --> 03:10:09,690
Oh, this is where I said I needed the yellow key!

3907
03:10:24,370 --> 03:10:27,090
Oh, I'll get it later!

3908
03:10:31,530 --> 03:10:31,890
Come on!

3909
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:32,670
Okay, let's try that again.

3910
03:10:32,670 --> 03:10:32,730
Let's jump to the next...

3911
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:33,150
Okay.

3912
03:10:33,150 --> 03:10:33,410
Come on, Simba!

3913
03:10:34,390 --> 03:10:35,090
Whoa, what's this?

3914
03:10:35,090 --> 03:10:35,770
It's like a...

3915
03:10:36,390 --> 03:10:37,830
It's like a set of enemies.

3916
03:10:37,870 --> 03:10:38,490
I'm like a...

3917
03:10:39,950 --> 03:10:40,510
I

3918
03:10:48,210 --> 03:10:48,810
said I was going to win.

3919
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:48,850
I made it!

3920
03:10:50,070 --> 03:10:50,630
I'm going to win!

3921
03:10:52,770 --> 03:10:56,330
I hate Payne and Elemental so much!

3922
03:10:57,430 --> 03:11:00,790
I hate those guys so much!

3923
03:11:01,630 --> 03:11:02,790
Is there anything over here?

3924
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:05,530
There's so many little areas that look like they could hold secrets.

3925
03:11:11,390 --> 03:11:12,910
I hear another one.

3926
03:11:13,050 --> 03:11:14,350
Unless that's a pickle.

3927
03:11:17,110 --> 03:11:17,630
Hmm.

3928
03:11:18,170 --> 03:11:18,690
Okay.

3929
03:11:20,010 --> 03:11:23,070
Now we have the red key so we can go all the way back.

3930
03:11:26,030 --> 03:11:27,270
All the way back.

3931
03:11:29,990 --> 03:11:30,950
This direction?

3932
03:11:31,730 --> 03:11:32,530
What is that?

3933
03:11:36,550 --> 03:11:38,030
Was that just doors closing?

3934
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:38,490
Okay.

3935
03:11:39,970 --> 03:11:41,930
Be on your lookout everybody.

3936
03:11:42,170 --> 03:11:43,390
Be on a lookout for...

3937
03:11:44,450 --> 03:11:44,850
Wait.

3938
03:11:44,950 --> 03:11:45,170
No.

3939
03:11:45,350 --> 03:11:45,890
I need to go downstairs.

3940
03:11:46,370 --> 03:11:46,770
Oh!

3941
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:47,150
There he is!

3942
03:11:49,050 --> 03:11:49,450
Gosh.

3943
03:11:50,270 --> 03:11:53,050
I won't be able to watch live because I'm working overtime!

3944
03:11:53,370 --> 03:11:53,830
Oh no!

3945
03:11:54,730 --> 03:11:58,810
But I'm super excited to see you work your way through the Outer Wilds DLC and the VODs.

3946
03:11:58,810 --> 03:11:59,510
Good luck and have fun!

3947
03:11:59,810 --> 03:12:00,450
Thank you!

3948
03:12:03,550 --> 03:12:04,530
Thank you so much!

3949
03:12:06,790 --> 03:12:07,190
Yeah.

3950
03:12:07,350 --> 03:12:07,670
Oh.

3951
03:12:08,690 --> 03:12:09,090
Oh!

3952
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:10,730
This is where they kill these guys!

3953
03:12:10,730 --> 03:12:11,810
Ha ha ha!

3954
03:12:13,610 --> 03:12:21,570
At Off-Kai, Atara and I were actually visited by one of the devs.

3955
03:12:21,990 --> 03:12:22,430
Oh!

3956
03:12:22,550 --> 03:12:23,210
Oh my gosh!

3957
03:12:23,990 --> 03:12:24,430
Oh!

3958
03:12:24,430 --> 03:12:24,870
Oh!

3959
03:12:25,470 --> 03:12:25,910
Oh!

3960
03:12:25,910 --> 03:12:26,310
Come on!

3961
03:12:27,610 --> 03:12:28,210
Where'd you go?

3962
03:12:31,650 --> 03:12:34,070
And he was just... and he wrote me a note.

3963
03:12:34,170 --> 03:12:37,910
He was like, by the way, you know, there's still the DLC for...

3964
03:12:39,550 --> 03:12:39,990
For...

3965
03:12:39,990 --> 03:12:42,190
Outer Wilds, if you ever play it.

3966
03:12:43,990 --> 03:12:44,750
Yeah, Jeffrey!

3967
03:12:45,470 --> 03:12:46,410
How did you guys know?

3968
03:12:46,870 --> 03:12:48,130
He loves VTubers.

3969
03:12:48,310 --> 03:12:48,970
He's so nice.

3970
03:12:49,930 --> 03:12:50,890
Zero items!

3971
03:12:52,770 --> 03:12:53,730
Zero secrets!

3972
03:12:54,770 --> 03:12:55,250
Oof.

3973
03:12:56,170 --> 03:12:57,050
Alter, okay.

3974
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,480
So I was just like, you know what?

3975
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:05,380
Yeah, you're right, Jeffrey.

3976
03:13:06,900 --> 03:13:08,280
I gotta do the DLC.

3977
03:13:09,620 --> 03:13:10,100
So...

3978
03:13:12,580 --> 03:13:14,400
Yeah, and then I was just like, why not?

3979
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:14,800
Why not?

3980
03:13:14,940 --> 03:13:15,780
Why don't I just do it?

3981
03:13:16,300 --> 03:13:17,220
What's stopping me?

3982
03:13:17,820 --> 03:13:18,800
Nothing's stopping me.

3983
03:13:20,580 --> 03:13:21,740
Myself, I'm stopping me.

3984
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:23,920
There's a secret exit here.

3985
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:24,680
Can you find it?

3986
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:25,180
There is?

3987
03:13:25,520 --> 03:13:26,420
Is it in the tree?

3988
03:13:33,100 --> 03:13:34,840
Sounds like cats meowing.

3989
03:13:35,020 --> 03:13:35,260
Oh!

3990
03:13:35,580 --> 03:13:36,140
Hold on!

3991
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:38,760
Let me make sure that pause is okay.

3992
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:40,700
Pause!

3993
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:42,120
Give me one second, guys.

3994
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:04,910
She did want out.

3995
03:14:05,390 --> 03:14:06,650
I didn't notice.

3996
03:14:07,270 --> 03:14:08,350
Oh, I feel so bad.

3997
03:14:08,470 --> 03:14:09,230
She wanted out.

3998
03:14:09,570 --> 03:14:10,550
I didn't notice.

3999
03:14:10,550 --> 03:14:12,310
She probably wanted to go, like, eat or...

4000
03:14:13,470 --> 03:14:14,710
Go to the bathroom.

4001
03:14:24,140 --> 03:14:25,020
Don't forget to save.

4002
03:14:25,140 --> 03:14:25,720
Oh, thank you.

4003
03:14:27,840 --> 03:14:28,280
Oh!

4004
03:14:34,170 --> 03:14:35,430
Sorry if you can hear my crunch.

4005
03:14:37,210 --> 03:14:39,370
Is this water that will kill me?

4006
03:14:43,090 --> 03:14:43,830
No, it's not.

4007
03:14:44,070 --> 03:14:45,790
It's just dirty, poopy water.

4008
03:14:47,190 --> 03:14:47,690
Nasty.

4009
03:14:54,980 --> 03:14:55,660
Oh, God.

4010
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:56,620
She ate pies.

4011
03:15:10,540 --> 03:15:12,100
Oh, I see you up there.

4012
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:13,420
Oh, my God.

4013
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:14,160
Ah!

4014
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:14,820
Ah!

4015
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:15,780
Ah!

4016
03:15:19,140 --> 03:15:20,400
My health!

4017
03:15:26,120 --> 03:15:27,800
You stupid...

4018
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,240
Oh, it's that guy.

4019
03:15:34,420 --> 03:15:34,840
No wonder.

4020
03:15:39,570 --> 03:15:41,110
I wonder if I can take him down.

4021
03:15:42,350 --> 03:15:44,270
Me-ow-ow-wo.

4022
03:15:48,010 --> 03:15:48,710
Hold on.

4023
03:15:56,270 --> 03:15:57,970
No spamming, please, but thank you.

4024
03:15:58,410 --> 03:16:00,910
May I offer you a blueberry in this trying time?

4025
03:16:01,170 --> 03:16:01,770
Yes, please.

4026
03:16:08,190 --> 03:16:10,010
I can't tell if I'm getting it or not.

4027
03:16:13,050 --> 03:16:14,090
Oh shoot.

4028
03:16:31,280 --> 03:16:31,750
Die

4029
03:16:35,420 --> 03:16:36,360
already!

4030
03:16:39,590 --> 03:16:41,830
Just die already!

4031
03:16:42,350 --> 03:16:43,230
Oh dang it.

4032
03:16:44,130 --> 03:16:45,490
Wasting rockets.

4033
03:16:49,790 --> 03:16:51,670
Die already!

4034
03:16:52,130 --> 03:16:53,850
Why can't I aim at you anymore?

4035
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:03,320
Die already!

4036
03:17:03,320 --> 03:17:03,320
Finally!

4037
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:05,380
Good moly!

4038
03:17:06,480 --> 03:17:08,940
Oh I got health.

4039
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:12,040
Oh my gosh I haven't had to collect regular health in so long.

4040
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:22,840
Dodge, dip, duck.

4041
03:17:27,420 --> 03:17:29,120
This map is...

4042
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:30,100
This is like...

4043
03:17:30,960 --> 03:17:33,100
It feels kind of Castlevania.

4044
03:17:33,820 --> 03:17:34,700
It's kind of funny.

4045
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:36,700
Blueberry!

4046
03:17:39,240 --> 03:17:42,600
Probably shouldn't just press random buttons but...

4047
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:43,760
You know.

4048
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:44,260
Wow!

4049
03:17:44,440 --> 03:17:45,120
Redberry!

4050
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:46,380
What's that one do?

4051
03:17:49,080 --> 03:17:51,320
I don't think I've ever seen the redberry before.

4052
03:17:55,420 --> 03:17:57,000
This map is bonkers.

4053
03:17:57,080 --> 03:17:58,520
I'm already so lost.

4054
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:01,180
I went through...

4055
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:06,120
I guess I should drop down and kind of look around somewhere else but...

4056
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:09,700
Thank god.

4057
03:18:09,700 --> 03:18:10,200
Over here.

4058
03:18:10,680 --> 03:18:11,280
Whoa!

4059
03:18:12,400 --> 03:18:13,000
Wow!

4060
03:18:13,440 --> 03:18:14,980
This is so cool!

4061
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:20,940
Take that.

4062
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:25,940
Apparently there was a secret exit at the beginning but...

4063
03:18:25,940 --> 03:18:27,740
I just chose to ignore it.

4064
03:18:30,060 --> 03:18:31,880
Redberry equals partial invisibility.

4065
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:34,920
Tree!

4066
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:46,010
At least the trees aren't here to kill me.

4067
03:18:46,530 --> 03:18:48,550
I love this little cave.

4068
03:18:48,810 --> 03:18:49,630
It's so cool.

4069
03:18:58,510 --> 03:19:00,830
Should have known something would be in there.

4070
03:19:01,590 --> 03:19:02,370
And I did.

4071
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:03,130
I did know.

4072
03:19:06,010 --> 03:19:06,870
Cozy cave.

4073
03:19:08,770 --> 03:19:10,590
The demons got it made.

4074
03:19:11,410 --> 03:19:14,730
They've got such a cool little thing going on here.

4075
03:19:16,130 --> 03:19:18,550
Oh, but there's nothing extra special over here.

4076
03:19:23,550 --> 03:19:26,090
Oh my god.

4077
03:19:26,990 --> 03:19:27,530
Whoa!

4078
03:19:34,050 --> 03:19:34,530
That was close.

4079
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:35,890
Oh!

4080
03:19:36,030 --> 03:19:37,030
This is actually a door!

4081
03:19:37,790 --> 03:19:38,470
Health

4082
03:19:44,060 --> 03:19:44,560
bonus.

4083
03:19:45,320 --> 03:19:47,880
All the ambient lighting is so fun.

4084
03:19:48,580 --> 03:19:49,760
You're a gamer.

4085
03:19:49,840 --> 03:19:50,700
Nice dodges.

4086
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:51,340
Thank you!

4087
03:19:52,340 --> 03:19:52,680
Oh!

4088
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:53,640
Look at that.

4089
03:19:54,260 --> 03:19:54,860
Oh!

4090
03:20:00,430 --> 03:20:01,110
Oh!

4091
03:20:02,550 --> 03:20:03,230
Oh!

4092
03:20:04,070 --> 03:20:05,010
Plasma gun!

4093
03:20:07,130 --> 03:20:07,570
Uh oh.

4094
03:20:07,670 --> 03:20:08,670
What am I pressing?

4095
03:20:08,910 --> 03:20:09,370
I'm scared.

4096
03:20:10,170 --> 03:20:11,370
What am I...

4097
03:20:18,010 --> 03:20:21,190
What am I inviting into the open, you know?

4098
03:20:29,850 --> 03:20:30,590
Box of bullets.

4099
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:31,610
I'll take it.

4100
03:20:32,730 --> 03:20:33,130
And...

4101
03:20:35,590 --> 03:20:36,490
Oh, that's nothing.

4102
03:20:39,010 --> 03:20:40,450
That's just some pile of meat.

4103
03:20:42,310 --> 03:20:43,890
The music is so scary.

4104
03:20:44,110 --> 03:20:44,730
I'm not gonna lie.

4105
03:20:45,050 --> 03:20:46,710
I really don't like it, actually.

4106
03:20:47,790 --> 03:20:48,790
Like, I like it.

4107
03:20:48,810 --> 03:20:51,450
Like, it's spooky and that's why I like it, but I don't like it.

4108
03:20:51,450 --> 03:20:52,670
Kinda scared.

4109
03:20:52,970 --> 03:20:54,650
I'm kinda scared, you guys.

4110
03:20:55,010 --> 03:20:55,610
Oh.

4111
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:01,470
It's unsettling.

4112
03:21:01,650 --> 03:21:04,070
Yeah, like, the meowing is really...

4113
03:21:06,730 --> 03:21:07,830
I don't...

4114
03:21:07,830 --> 03:21:09,170
I don't like it.

4115
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:12,170
Meow.

4116
03:21:14,530 --> 03:21:17,990
Why is there demon meat on the ground, I wonder?

4117
03:21:20,550 --> 03:21:21,950
Sounds like a baby crying.

4118
03:21:22,070 --> 03:21:22,270
Yeah!

4119
03:21:22,270 --> 03:21:24,130
That's what I mean by the cat noises.

4120
03:21:24,610 --> 03:21:25,310
I guess...

4121
03:21:26,650 --> 03:21:27,830
There's an exit over there.

4122
03:21:28,930 --> 03:21:30,230
Is that where the exit is?

4123
03:21:30,890 --> 03:21:31,150
Okay.

4124
03:21:31,290 --> 03:21:32,170
Good to know.

4125
03:21:33,330 --> 03:21:34,750
Good to know.

4126
03:21:35,030 --> 03:21:36,530
That's where we go.

4127
03:21:37,610 --> 03:21:39,190
What did those switches do?

4128
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:40,350
I don't know.

4129
03:21:41,490 --> 03:21:43,310
Oh, this game is such a mystery.

4130
03:21:45,510 --> 03:21:46,030
Meow.

4131
03:21:54,090 --> 03:21:55,710
Can I run to this?

4132
03:21:55,930 --> 03:21:56,090
What?

4133
03:21:56,430 --> 03:21:57,230
Oh, I can.

4134
03:21:57,470 --> 03:21:58,030
Cool.

4135
03:22:03,080 --> 03:22:03,640
Ah!

4136
03:22:04,020 --> 03:22:04,880
This area.

4137
03:22:08,780 --> 03:22:09,560
Yeah, yeah.

4138
03:22:10,920 --> 03:22:11,840
Yeah, yeah.

4139
03:22:11,980 --> 03:22:12,760
Shut up.

4140
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:13,720
Oh!

4141
03:22:13,800 --> 03:22:15,300
We got a red key.

4142
03:22:18,800 --> 03:22:19,360
Oh!

4143
03:22:20,500 --> 03:22:21,460
I'm hearing something.

4144
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:21,720
Oh!

4145
03:22:21,960 --> 03:22:22,520
Oh!

4146
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:23,320
I got him.

4147
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:26,740
All right.

4148
03:22:29,140 --> 03:22:29,980
Red key.

4149
03:22:33,780 --> 03:22:34,340
Where?

4150
03:22:35,080 --> 03:22:35,640
Where?

4151
03:22:35,920 --> 03:22:36,040
Ah!

4152
03:22:36,940 --> 03:22:37,240
Yeah!

4153
03:22:38,940 --> 03:22:39,500
Imp!

4154
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:40,840
Come back here, imp!

4155
03:22:43,380 --> 03:22:44,400
And there's...

4156
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:44,440
Oh!

4157
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:46,500
There's a pinky down there.

4158
03:22:48,820 --> 03:22:49,380
Somewhere.

4159
03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:00,480
What?

4160
03:23:00,600 --> 03:23:01,160
Thank you for the red key.

4161
03:23:01,180 --> 03:23:01,300
Oh!

4162
03:23:01,320 --> 03:23:01,340
Red!

4163
03:23:02,380 --> 03:23:02,940
Oh!

4164
03:23:04,790 --> 03:23:05,350
Sorry.

4165
03:23:06,190 --> 03:23:07,090
I can't...

4166
03:23:07,090 --> 03:23:09,990
Why did YouTube change it to white on white text, man?

4167
03:23:10,850 --> 03:23:11,770
Don't understand.

4168
03:23:12,750 --> 03:23:12,930
Oh!

4169
03:23:13,750 --> 03:23:15,050
Look at the invisibility.

4170
03:23:16,750 --> 03:23:17,310
Nice.

4171
03:23:18,130 --> 03:23:18,690
Um...

4172
03:23:19,770 --> 03:23:20,810
I, uh...

4173
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:22,610
Rose went and sampled the cat.

4174
03:23:25,750 --> 03:23:26,310
Ah!

4175
03:23:26,350 --> 03:23:26,990
Oh, my God!

4176
03:23:27,790 --> 03:23:28,710
I was invisible!

4177
03:23:29,650 --> 03:23:30,970
How did you find me?

4178
03:23:34,090 --> 03:23:35,090
This is messed up.

4179
03:23:36,930 --> 03:23:37,410
Messed up!

4180
03:23:39,850 --> 03:23:40,710
Thank you for the red!

4181
03:23:40,870 --> 03:23:41,270
Thank you!

4182
03:23:42,210 --> 03:23:43,310
I'm gonna go down here.

4183
03:23:44,190 --> 03:23:46,830
Grab some more shotgun shells.

4184
03:23:48,990 --> 03:23:49,750
And then the...

4185
03:23:49,750 --> 03:23:50,550
Get the pinky here.

4186
03:23:53,950 --> 03:23:54,730
There he goes.

4187
03:23:57,990 --> 03:23:58,390
Oh!

4188
03:23:58,410 --> 03:23:58,870
This is the...

4189
03:23:59,790 --> 03:24:00,630
Isn't this the beginning?

4190
03:24:02,090 --> 03:24:02,490
Yeah.

4191
03:24:02,650 --> 03:24:03,890
This is the beginning.

4192
03:24:04,150 --> 03:24:05,550
This is where we teleported away.

4193
03:24:09,590 --> 03:24:12,070
We didn't go anywhere like over here.

4194
03:24:12,370 --> 03:24:14,050
Jay, thanks for the vibe gifter!

4195
03:24:15,090 --> 03:24:15,690
Wowee!

4196
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:17,890
Oh, gosh.

4197
03:24:21,170 --> 03:24:21,770
Okay.

4198
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:26,250
Oh, someone else is shooting at me from somewhere.

4199
03:24:27,730 --> 03:24:29,210
Not quite sure where.

4200
03:24:29,850 --> 03:24:30,450
Blueberry.

4201
03:24:30,670 --> 03:24:30,950
Blueberry.

4202
03:24:31,270 --> 03:24:31,870
Blueberry.

4203
03:24:32,030 --> 03:24:32,630
Blueberry.

4204
03:24:38,980 --> 03:24:39,920
Where are they shooting?

4205
03:24:40,040 --> 03:24:40,100
Oh.

4206
03:24:43,060 --> 03:24:44,020
Don't walk away!

4207
03:24:44,760 --> 03:24:47,040
He was like, I'm not even gonna look.

4208
03:24:47,220 --> 03:24:48,940
I know they're gonna hit you.

4209
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:51,360
I don't even need to see.

4210
03:24:55,800 --> 03:24:57,040
Come back and fight me.

4211
03:24:57,740 --> 03:24:58,440
Like a man.

4212
03:24:59,300 --> 03:25:00,140
Hola, mint.

4213
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:00,560
Hola!

4214
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:04,360
It's been two spooky months.

4215
03:25:04,460 --> 03:25:04,820
I know!

4216
03:25:04,820 --> 03:25:06,220
I was just thinking that.

4217
03:25:06,380 --> 03:25:06,820
I was like, wow.

4218
03:25:06,900 --> 03:25:10,760
I can't believe it's been like two months since I've... since I've come back to streaming.

4219
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:12,180
Already.

4220
03:25:13,780 --> 03:25:16,600
Feels so much longer and shorter at the same time, right?

4221
03:25:21,230 --> 03:25:22,950
It's partial invisibility.

4222
03:25:23,230 --> 03:25:25,690
Like being partially pregnant.

4223
03:25:34,010 --> 03:25:34,450
What?

4224
03:25:38,800 --> 03:25:40,400
I don't think you can be partial.

4225
03:25:42,280 --> 03:25:44,180
I don't even think you can be impartial.

4226
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:50,300
I don't think so.

4227
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:51,840
Oh my God.

4228
03:25:51,860 --> 03:25:52,220
The cross.

4229
03:25:54,840 --> 03:25:55,360
Spooky.

4230
03:26:02,020 --> 03:26:03,680
We're almost at a year, baby.

4231
03:26:03,880 --> 03:26:04,940
How do I get...

4232
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:05,660
Wait.

4233
03:26:06,040 --> 03:26:06,560
Okay.

4234
03:26:06,880 --> 03:26:08,380
So we got the red key.

4235
03:26:08,460 --> 03:26:11,540
So where was a red door?

4236
03:26:11,660 --> 03:26:12,660
I don't remember.

4237
03:26:13,780 --> 03:26:15,780
Let's teleport back up here.

4238
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:16,800
Okay.

4239
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:20,660
And figure it out.

4240
03:26:20,820 --> 03:26:21,420
I said...

4241
03:26:21,420 --> 03:26:21,740
Oh.

4242
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,400
Hey, you.

4243
03:26:24,580 --> 03:26:25,380
Don't run away.

4244
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:27,540
Yeah, that's right.

4245
03:26:31,740 --> 03:26:33,660
Can't believe it's been two years, boss.

4246
03:26:36,060 --> 03:26:36,820
Oh, here.

4247
03:26:44,540 --> 03:26:45,920
Oh, I'm lost.

4248
03:26:46,260 --> 03:26:47,100
In the sauce.

4249
03:26:47,440 --> 03:26:48,000
Okay.

4250
03:26:48,680 --> 03:26:49,240
Okay.

4251
03:26:49,660 --> 03:26:50,220
Okay.

4252
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:50,760
Okay.

4253
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:54,280
Come on.

4254
03:26:54,280 --> 03:26:54,540
Oh my God.

4255
03:26:54,680 --> 03:26:55,140
Hah.

4256
03:26:55,620 --> 03:26:56,140
Hah.

4257
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:57,260
Holy cow.

4258
03:26:57,680 --> 03:27:00,980
Just came up and I didn't even know he was going to be there.

4259
03:27:06,600 --> 03:27:07,120
Hiyah.

4260
03:27:18,150 --> 03:27:18,670
Nice.

4261
03:27:20,690 --> 03:27:21,490
Door's stuck.

4262
03:27:23,330 --> 03:27:23,850
Nice.

4263
03:27:23,850 --> 03:27:25,310
Anybody in there?

4264
03:27:26,310 --> 03:27:27,210
Plasma gun?

4265
03:27:27,410 --> 03:27:28,350
Plasma ammo?

4266
03:27:32,530 --> 03:27:33,810
Oh, sacrifice!

4267
03:27:39,530 --> 03:27:41,670
This seems like kind of a big deal.

4268
03:27:44,770 --> 03:27:46,310
What is this?

4269
03:27:46,530 --> 03:27:46,870
Wait!

4270
03:27:47,010 --> 03:27:49,250
I got unholy fire...

4271
03:27:49,250 --> 03:27:50,190
Wait, what is this?

4272
03:27:50,450 --> 03:27:53,370
I thought it was like a human body!

4273
03:27:54,570 --> 03:27:56,850
Does this use my health?

4274
03:28:00,530 --> 03:28:02,330
What does this...?

4275
03:28:02,330 --> 03:28:03,510
The Unmaker.

4276
03:28:05,350 --> 03:28:06,190
Ow!

4277
03:28:14,740 --> 03:28:16,100
I obliterated him!

4278
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:20,880
It unmakes things.

4279
03:28:24,860 --> 03:28:26,940
What does it use for ammo?

4280
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:31,240
Really powerful energy weapon.

4281
03:28:31,400 --> 03:28:31,880
Let's go!

4282
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:35,480
How do I get up there?

4283
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:36,140
Let's see.

4284
03:28:38,320 --> 03:28:39,340
Oh my gosh.

4285
03:28:39,480 --> 03:28:40,940
The Baron scared me.

4286
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:46,760
Through here, maybe?

4287
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:56,900
Got it.

4288
03:28:57,020 --> 03:28:57,380
Okay.

4289
03:28:57,740 --> 03:29:00,920
Yellow... skull... yellow door...

4290
03:29:00,920 --> 03:29:01,640
Where is the yellow door?

4291
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:03,320
Yellow door...

4292
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:06,080
I can't avoid it.

4293
03:29:08,780 --> 03:29:10,760
I got a... I got a berry.

4294
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:11,660
Blueberry.

4295
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:14,980
Wait, so what number is that?

4296
03:29:15,140 --> 03:29:15,840
Okay, it's 8.

4297
03:29:16,020 --> 03:29:16,640
Oh my gosh.

4298
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:18,700
Holy cow!

4299
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:20,900
Okay, yellow door.

4300
03:29:21,100 --> 03:29:21,620
Yellow door.

4301
03:29:35,610 --> 03:29:38,410
Is it friendly fire if ghosts fight demons like this?

4302
03:29:38,410 --> 03:29:39,230
Oh!

4303
03:29:39,270 --> 03:29:39,710
No!

4304
03:29:40,570 --> 03:29:42,590
We're completely different, ghosts and demons.

4305
03:29:44,310 --> 03:29:45,210
Ghosts are way superior.

4306
03:29:46,670 --> 03:29:47,110
Obviously.

4307
03:29:49,450 --> 03:29:50,330
Yellow door...

4308
03:29:50,330 --> 03:29:51,650
Do you guys remember?

4309
03:29:52,710 --> 03:29:55,010
So close yet so far from the secret exit.

4310
03:29:55,110 --> 03:29:55,510
It's okay.

4311
03:29:55,630 --> 03:29:56,150
Don't worry.

4312
03:29:56,290 --> 03:29:57,190
That's why it's a secret.

4313
03:29:58,430 --> 03:30:00,250
If I don't get it, I don't get it.

4314
03:30:00,290 --> 03:30:00,990
Sometimes I do.

4315
03:30:01,310 --> 03:30:02,970
Sometimes I have a stroke of genius.

4316
03:30:04,450 --> 03:30:05,110
Maybe... Okay.

4317
03:30:05,670 --> 03:30:07,070
How do I get to there?

4318
03:30:08,710 --> 03:30:09,530
Okay, hold on.

4319
03:30:09,630 --> 03:30:11,750
Let's go back this way.

4320
03:30:12,430 --> 03:30:15,930
Let's teleport back up because I do maybe want to try through that exit.

4321
03:30:18,170 --> 03:30:19,750
And sometimes just a stroke.

4322
03:30:21,290 --> 03:30:21,770
Yeah!

4323
03:30:25,130 --> 03:30:26,950
Love when I have just a stroke.

4324
03:30:28,210 --> 03:30:29,530
Okay, maybe I go through here.

4325
03:30:31,490 --> 03:30:32,450
So yellow.

4326
03:30:32,670 --> 03:30:32,830
Oh!

4327
03:30:33,290 --> 03:30:35,090
Of course it's so yellow in here.

4328
03:30:38,990 --> 03:30:39,750
Oh!

4329
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:40,510
Eight.

4330
03:30:41,450 --> 03:30:43,010
I want to use it on you.

4331
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:48,030
Oh, it misses very easily though.

4332
03:30:49,130 --> 03:30:51,570
It misses extremely easily.

4333
03:31:01,980 --> 03:31:02,360
Yeah!

4334
03:31:02,520 --> 03:31:03,160
Unbirth him!

4335
03:31:04,840 --> 03:31:07,760
Happy unbirthday to you, Baron.

4336
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:21,680
Happy unbirthday to you, Baron.

4337
03:31:21,680 --> 03:31:22,180
Is this timed?

4338
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:43,220
It's just so funny that they were like, nope, you can't get it unless you kill that guy.

4339
03:31:44,220 --> 03:31:45,980
And it was like...

4340
03:31:48,890 --> 03:31:51,770
If you sneak up behind her...

4341
03:31:52,390 --> 03:31:53,590
Oh, I missed someone.

4342
03:31:55,230 --> 03:31:55,570
I wonder who.

4343
03:31:56,350 --> 03:31:57,850
Zero secrets.

4344
03:31:58,450 --> 03:32:01,730
I love M64.

4345
03:32:02,970 --> 03:32:04,550
Thanks for the super chat.

4346
03:32:08,420 --> 03:32:09,520
Baby mode moment.

4347
03:32:09,780 --> 03:32:10,640
I guess so.

4348
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:14,160
Wow!

4349
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:16,440
I love that thing right there.

4350
03:32:20,440 --> 03:32:22,920
The decor is immaculate.

4351
03:32:27,050 --> 03:32:28,230
Are we on what?

4352
03:32:28,370 --> 03:32:29,150
13 now?

4353
03:32:31,350 --> 03:32:31,870
Oh!

4354
03:32:31,870 --> 03:32:32,550
Come here!

4355
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:38,980
The sound is on.

4356
03:32:39,080 --> 03:32:39,960
It's really echo-y.

4357
03:32:45,570 --> 03:32:46,090
Hmm.

4358
03:32:52,440 --> 03:32:52,960
Oh!

4359
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:54,120
Lots of...

4360
03:32:55,320 --> 03:32:56,340
Lots of...

4361
03:32:56,760 --> 03:32:57,020
Oh!

4362
03:32:57,080 --> 03:32:57,520
Uh-oh!

4363
03:32:57,560 --> 03:32:58,580
I hear those things again.

4364
03:32:58,820 --> 03:32:59,080
Oh!

4365
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:00,500
I hear the clanks.

4366
03:33:03,680 --> 03:33:04,480
I heard it.

4367
03:33:04,520 --> 03:33:04,900
I heard it.

4368
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:05,380
I heard it.

4369
03:33:07,480 --> 03:33:07,840
Hmm.

4370
03:33:09,460 --> 03:33:10,940
Yeah, this level...

4371
03:33:10,940 --> 03:33:11,300
Uh-oh.

4372
03:33:11,380 --> 03:33:12,600
What am I gonna have a...

4373
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:13,940
Am I in for a bad time?

4374
03:33:15,320 --> 03:33:16,360
Am I in for it?

4375
03:33:21,700 --> 03:33:22,720
I'm afraid of them.

4376
03:33:24,240 --> 03:33:25,500
I don't know where they come from.

4377
03:33:27,300 --> 03:33:30,020
I don't think I really need to even go in here though, right?

4378
03:33:31,820 --> 03:33:32,900
We'll just, uh...

4379
03:33:33,520 --> 03:33:34,860
Cruise in for a bruising.

4380
03:33:36,460 --> 03:33:36,940
Oh!

4381
03:33:37,720 --> 03:33:38,200
Ow!

4382
03:33:39,480 --> 03:33:41,120
I thought I dodged that!

4383
03:33:41,220 --> 03:33:41,340
Wait!

4384
03:33:41,400 --> 03:33:42,140
Where did it come from?

4385
03:33:42,740 --> 03:33:43,640
Oh my gosh.

4386
03:33:44,980 --> 03:33:45,460
Oh.

4387
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:46,520
Okay.

4388
03:33:52,440 --> 03:33:53,140
We'll shoot.

4389
03:33:54,520 --> 03:33:55,360
Check out...

4390
03:33:55,360 --> 03:33:58,120
Immorifer's Doom64 Discord server.

4391
03:33:58,420 --> 03:33:58,600
Oh!

4392
03:33:58,940 --> 03:34:00,440
I don't know if I'll join that.

4393
03:34:00,580 --> 03:34:02,620
But if anybody is interested and wants to...

4394
03:34:02,620 --> 03:34:04,780
join more Doom stuff, then they can do that.

4395
03:34:05,480 --> 03:34:06,360
But thank you!

4396
03:34:07,020 --> 03:34:07,460
Hmm.

4397
03:34:12,720 --> 03:34:13,400
Not yet.

4398
03:34:13,600 --> 03:34:13,740
Oh!

4399
03:34:15,260 --> 03:34:16,440
I need a red key.

4400
03:34:21,190 --> 03:34:21,630
Uh.

4401
03:34:21,810 --> 03:34:22,210
In here?

4402
03:34:25,850 --> 03:34:27,290
Why can't I pick this up?

4403
03:34:27,730 --> 03:34:28,170
Ah!

4404
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:32,850
Oh my god.

4405
03:34:32,870 --> 03:34:33,090
Ouch!

4406
03:34:33,230 --> 03:34:33,470
Ouch!

4407
03:34:33,590 --> 03:34:33,730
Ouch!

4408
03:34:33,730 --> 03:34:33,910
Ouch!

4409
03:34:33,990 --> 03:34:34,030
Ouch!

4410
03:34:44,830 --> 03:34:45,510
Oh my god.

4411
03:34:47,050 --> 03:34:47,570
Ugh!

4412
03:34:52,620 --> 03:34:53,520
Oh my god.

4413
03:34:53,560 --> 03:34:54,200
That was so close.

4414
03:34:54,760 --> 03:34:55,940
I almost just died.

4415
03:34:59,360 --> 03:35:00,880
I almost just fell in.

4416
03:35:02,440 --> 03:35:02,960
Oh.

4417
03:35:04,400 --> 03:35:05,900
Didn't even see that guy over there.

4418
03:35:08,860 --> 03:35:09,600
What the...

4419
03:35:10,460 --> 03:35:10,980
Okay.

4420
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:12,990
Hey, hey, hey.

4421
03:35:12,990 --> 03:35:13,010
So, what's going on?

4422
03:35:13,010 --> 03:35:13,090
So, I can't really see you.

4423
03:35:13,090 --> 03:35:13,430
Stop.

4424
03:35:13,430 --> 03:35:14,970
Can you teabag in this game?

4425
03:35:15,170 --> 03:35:16,090
You can't even jump.

4426
03:35:17,770 --> 03:35:19,410
I don't think you can teabag.

4427
03:35:20,850 --> 03:35:22,310
Wasted opportunity, truly.

4428
03:35:26,250 --> 03:35:28,610
I guess we'll save that for later.

4429
03:35:31,970 --> 03:35:35,870
Any other pillars that have any pushy buttons?

4430
03:35:36,170 --> 03:35:36,930
Any demon buttons?

4431
03:35:37,850 --> 03:35:38,990
Greetings from Chile!

4432
03:35:39,490 --> 03:35:40,690
Also first time watching, hello!

4433
03:35:40,690 --> 03:35:42,590
Thanks for watching!

4434
03:35:43,610 --> 03:35:44,770
Thanks for joining.

4435
03:35:45,610 --> 03:35:47,270
We're having a Doomtastic day.

4436
03:35:47,970 --> 03:35:49,290
I hope you are as well.

4437
03:35:49,930 --> 03:35:51,490
Where did that little...

4438
03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:53,690
I heard the clanks.

4439
03:35:53,850 --> 03:35:54,930
Okay, I'm just gonna go in.

4440
03:35:59,070 --> 03:36:00,410
Yeah, I didn't even...

4441
03:36:00,410 --> 03:36:01,570
Oh, there it is!

4442
03:36:01,750 --> 03:36:02,190
Okay.

4443
03:36:05,030 --> 03:36:07,430
And it doesn't lift this up.

4444
03:36:07,550 --> 03:36:09,010
But maybe it lifts up the other one.

4445
03:36:13,570 --> 03:36:13,930
Woo!

4446
03:36:15,510 --> 03:36:16,170
There we go.

4447
03:36:17,030 --> 03:36:17,750
Oh, no.

4448
03:36:19,570 --> 03:36:20,650
Wait, no, it didn't.

4449
03:36:20,670 --> 03:36:22,190
That didn't do at all what I thought it would.

4450
03:36:24,430 --> 03:36:25,410
What the heck?

4451
03:36:26,390 --> 03:36:30,190
You guys are so funny.

4452
03:36:35,230 --> 03:36:37,490
Oh my god, I thought that was a person standing there.

4453
03:36:38,970 --> 03:36:40,550
That freaked me out for a second.

4454
03:36:41,070 --> 03:36:42,390
Wait, where the hell am I?

4455
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:50,820
Oh, shoot.

4456
03:36:51,880 --> 03:36:53,740
Okay, there's a lot going on in here.

4457
03:36:53,900 --> 03:36:54,180
Okay.

4458
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:55,880
There's a...

4459
03:36:55,880 --> 03:36:56,900
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4460
03:36:58,240 --> 03:36:59,580
There's a lot going on here.

4461
03:37:09,980 --> 03:37:11,080
Take it easy.

4462
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:13,720
Shoot and dodge, shoot and dodge.

4463
03:37:14,300 --> 03:37:15,220
Shoot and punch.

4464
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:17,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4465
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:18,500
Oh, clutch.

4466
03:37:20,860 --> 03:37:21,640
Shoot and dodge.

4467
03:37:21,740 --> 03:37:22,580
Shoot and dodge.

4468
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:23,240
Shoot and dodge.

4469
03:37:25,240 --> 03:37:26,460
I know there's more of you.

4470
03:37:26,920 --> 03:37:28,260
I know there's more of you.

4471
03:37:28,300 --> 03:37:28,760
Where are...

4472
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:30,400
Where are you?

4473
03:37:37,590 --> 03:37:38,930
Shoot and doji.

4474
03:37:39,130 --> 03:37:39,530
No.

4475
03:37:41,070 --> 03:37:41,990
I mean, I wish.

4476
03:37:43,350 --> 03:37:44,010
I wish.

4477
03:37:44,090 --> 03:37:44,430
Jeez.

4478
03:37:46,130 --> 03:37:47,730
I don't know much about fate.

4479
03:37:47,730 --> 03:37:49,230
But I know shoot and doji.

4480
03:37:56,080 --> 03:37:57,480
I think I saw another one.

4481
03:37:58,080 --> 03:37:58,800
Well, I know.

4482
03:37:58,960 --> 03:37:59,080
There.

4483
03:38:03,100 --> 03:38:04,160
Where are you?

4484
03:38:06,340 --> 03:38:06,780
Oh.

4485
03:38:07,340 --> 03:38:08,080
Oh, oh, oh.

4486
03:38:08,640 --> 03:38:09,080
Where?

4487
03:38:09,620 --> 03:38:10,060
Oh.

4488
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:17,940
Oh my god, there's still so many.

4489
03:38:21,580 --> 03:38:22,640
Okay, one more.

4490
03:38:22,640 --> 03:38:22,720
One more.

4491
03:38:23,240 --> 03:38:23,900
One more.

4492
03:38:24,660 --> 03:38:26,460
I could save him for later, but...

4493
03:38:27,440 --> 03:38:29,240
I like to clean up an area, you know?

4494
03:38:32,540 --> 03:38:34,300
Mint and shoot and doji have a win?

4495
03:38:34,520 --> 03:38:35,200
Oh my gosh, so embarrassing.

4496
03:38:40,260 --> 03:38:40,980
I'm too shy.

4497
03:38:43,800 --> 03:38:44,640
Okay, screw it.

4498
03:38:44,740 --> 03:38:45,220
I don't care.

4499
03:38:47,420 --> 03:38:48,180
I'll come back.

4500
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:50,280
I'll get them when we get there.

4501
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:55,280
I'll get them when we get there.

4502
03:38:55,740 --> 03:38:56,220
Wait.

4503
03:38:56,340 --> 03:38:57,600
Which is right now.

4504
03:38:58,100 --> 03:38:58,580
Apparently.

4505
03:39:05,610 --> 03:39:06,350
Wait, there's more?

4506
03:39:06,530 --> 03:39:06,890
Oh.

4507
03:39:09,250 --> 03:39:10,650
Where else are they coming from?

4508
03:39:11,210 --> 03:39:11,690
Oh.

4509
03:39:14,190 --> 03:39:14,670
Oh.

4510
03:39:16,950 --> 03:39:20,290
I'm too shy for that outfit, you guys.

4511
03:39:28,390 --> 03:39:29,170
Green berry.

4512
03:39:29,430 --> 03:39:29,750
Oh, no.

4513
03:39:29,750 --> 03:39:29,770
Oh, no.

4514
03:39:29,770 --> 03:39:30,890
How do I get to him?

4515
03:39:34,680 --> 03:39:35,860
Ask and you shall receive.

4516
03:39:36,720 --> 03:39:38,160
May I have a berry?

4517
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:40,020
May I have a bite?

4518
03:39:40,860 --> 03:39:42,080
This one's kind of spooky looking.

4519
03:39:43,600 --> 03:39:45,040
Shuten has a maid outfit of her own?

4520
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:45,300
She does?

4521
03:39:47,420 --> 03:39:49,140
Why have I never seen this before?

4522
03:39:50,000 --> 03:39:51,560
Or maybe I have and I just forgot.

4523
03:39:53,760 --> 03:39:54,480
Red key.

4524
03:39:56,940 --> 03:39:57,560
Okay, good.

4525
03:39:58,080 --> 03:39:58,480
Oh.

4526
03:39:58,600 --> 03:39:59,180
Oh, wait.

4527
03:39:59,180 --> 03:40:00,100
We don't have the blue key.

4528
03:40:03,700 --> 03:40:09,840
I just noticed all the little gargoyles are staring at me.

4529
03:40:11,260 --> 03:40:13,400
Why are you guys so obsessed with me?

4530
03:40:13,520 --> 03:40:14,140
Stop looking.

4531
03:40:20,500 --> 03:40:21,340
Let's see.

4532
03:40:21,920 --> 03:40:22,920
Is there anything?

4533
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:25,080
I'm looking for any buttons to push.

4534
03:40:26,360 --> 03:40:27,780
That aren't my own.

4535
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:31,020
This game do be pushing my buttons though.

4536
03:40:31,840 --> 03:40:32,360
Wait.

4537
03:40:32,400 --> 03:40:32,900
Can I go back?

4538
03:40:32,980 --> 03:40:33,120
Oh.

4539
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:34,740
Okay.

4540
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:35,660
I can go back up.

4541
03:40:36,900 --> 03:40:38,620
La la la la.

4542
03:40:39,140 --> 03:40:39,660
Whoa!

4543
03:40:40,660 --> 03:40:42,240
He just came from the wall.

4544
03:40:46,660 --> 03:40:47,840
Oh, it's here.

4545
03:40:49,300 --> 03:40:50,680
Should we try for it?

4546
03:40:52,520 --> 03:40:53,680
I might die.

4547
03:40:54,760 --> 03:40:55,800
Here, I'm going to save.

4548
03:40:57,960 --> 03:40:59,000
Save game.

4549
03:40:59,580 --> 03:41:00,100
Save game.

4550
03:41:00,380 --> 03:41:00,640
Save game.

4551
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:01,680
Save game.

4552
03:41:02,960 --> 03:41:03,440
Okay.

4553
03:41:03,620 --> 03:41:04,040
Okay,

4554
03:41:07,230 --> 03:41:07,230
I wrote a little mistake.

4555
03:41:07,230 --> 03:41:07,870
Let's make sure that...

4556
03:41:07,870 --> 03:41:08,150
Oh.

4557
03:41:08,550 --> 03:41:09,950
Run is on.

4558
03:41:12,590 --> 03:41:13,070
Yippee!

4559
03:41:17,030 --> 03:41:17,510
Um,

4560
03:41:26,350 --> 03:41:27,790
I don't think I remember...

4561
03:41:29,950 --> 03:41:31,010
Okay, this is the beginning.

4562
03:41:31,310 --> 03:41:35,030
I don't remember pushing any buttons, but...

4563
03:41:38,530 --> 03:41:39,850
And we don't have the red key.

4564
03:41:39,930 --> 03:41:40,210
Okay.

4565
03:41:42,770 --> 03:41:43,250
I'm going to go to this one over there, buh.

4566
03:41:43,250 --> 03:41:45,170
No, okay, so that's still not open.

4567
03:41:52,850 --> 03:41:54,050
And here...

4568
03:41:55,650 --> 03:41:56,250
Again.

4569
03:41:57,030 --> 03:41:57,630
No.

4570
03:41:59,130 --> 03:41:59,730
Yes.

4571
03:42:00,630 --> 03:42:01,230
Yeah.

4572
03:42:02,290 --> 03:42:03,830
Oh my gosh!

4573
03:42:04,990 --> 03:42:05,630
Stop it!

4574
03:42:06,890 --> 03:42:08,210
Wait, where was it again?

4575
03:42:08,450 --> 03:42:10,070
Wait, now I'm lost actually.

4576
03:42:10,390 --> 03:42:11,230
Okay, hold on.

4577
03:42:11,370 --> 03:42:12,250
Don't shoot at me.

4578
03:42:15,130 --> 03:42:16,170
This is the entrance.

4579
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:21,520
Oh, here we go.

4580
03:42:23,040 --> 03:42:23,520
Okay.

4581
03:42:24,560 --> 03:42:27,360
So we didn't go this way.

4582
03:42:30,100 --> 03:42:32,440
I could probably get the green berry from here.

4583
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:37,420
Let me get the green berry.

4584
03:42:43,760 --> 03:42:44,240
Invulnerability!

4585
03:42:47,760 --> 03:42:48,620
And let's hurry.

4586
03:42:50,460 --> 03:42:51,680
Are you Dooming?

4587
03:42:51,720 --> 03:42:53,200
I can't see anything actually.

4588
03:42:53,420 --> 03:42:53,980
Oh, god.

4589
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:55,300
I'm Dooming!

4590
03:42:55,560 --> 03:42:56,580
But I can't...

4591
03:42:56,580 --> 03:42:57,260
Oh, gosh.

4592
03:42:57,300 --> 03:42:58,740
I can't see anything while I'm Dooming.

4593
03:43:02,840 --> 03:43:03,320
Oh,

4594
03:43:09,010 --> 03:43:09,170
god.

4595
03:43:09,190 --> 03:43:09,450
Oh, god.

4596
03:43:09,490 --> 03:43:09,870
Oh, god.

4597
03:43:09,870 --> 03:43:09,910
Oh.

4598
03:43:32,010 --> 03:43:32,810
Let's do this.

4599
03:43:33,490 --> 03:43:33,970
Yeah!

4600
03:43:36,650 --> 03:43:37,910
Oh my god.

4601
03:43:37,910 --> 03:43:38,530
Another one.

4602
03:43:38,570 --> 03:43:39,790
Yeah!

4603
03:43:42,940 --> 03:43:44,640
Everybody okay?

4604
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:46,160
Everybody good?

4605
03:43:48,480 --> 03:43:51,140
Un-make those barons.

4606
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:56,740
Uh-oh.

4607
03:44:01,510 --> 03:44:04,510
When does it end?

4608
03:44:13,570 --> 03:44:14,270
Okay.

4609
03:44:14,850 --> 03:44:16,170
Okay!

4610
03:44:22,380 --> 03:44:22,820
Okay!

4611
03:44:25,640 --> 03:44:26,920
Kind of a beat.

4612
03:44:33,350 --> 03:44:34,570
Indiana Jones time.

4613
03:44:34,750 --> 03:44:36,550
I sure hope I didn't miss something.

4614
03:44:37,190 --> 03:44:38,530
Probably did, but...

4615
03:44:40,030 --> 03:44:41,650
Oh, my throat is really starting to hurt.

4616
03:44:46,780 --> 03:44:49,660
Okay, so I do need to go out here.

4617
03:44:49,820 --> 03:44:50,140
Okay.

4618
03:44:50,880 --> 03:44:51,540
Got it.

4619
03:44:51,720 --> 03:44:52,440
Let's try again.

4620
03:45:06,560 --> 03:45:08,600
I took minimal damage!

4621
03:45:10,320 --> 03:45:12,720
264 is some of the most deadly traps since Plutonia.

4622
03:45:12,880 --> 03:45:13,760
Not Plutonia.

4623
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:15,480
Okay.

4624
03:45:15,880 --> 03:45:17,100
Blue key acquired.

4625
03:45:17,700 --> 03:45:18,860
How do I get out of here?

4626
03:45:19,080 --> 03:45:19,340
I don't know.

4627
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:22,490
Uh, exit?

4628
03:45:23,410 --> 03:45:24,470
Exit doku diskar?

4629
03:45:30,450 --> 03:45:31,650
Where the heck is the exit?

4630
03:45:32,690 --> 03:45:34,390
Unless I... I have to...

4631
03:45:36,990 --> 03:45:37,550
Ugh...

4632
03:45:39,070 --> 03:45:40,370
Does it only open?

4633
03:45:41,170 --> 03:45:41,730
Nope.

4634
03:45:41,850 --> 03:45:42,390
Oh, shit.

4635
03:45:48,050 --> 03:45:50,590
I'll take darts over chaingunners and arch-viles?

4636
03:45:51,090 --> 03:45:51,650
Maybe.

4637
03:45:51,890 --> 03:45:52,750
Hug the wall.

4638
03:45:52,870 --> 03:45:53,070
Okay.

4639
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:00,370
Oh!

4640
03:46:01,590 --> 03:46:02,450
La la la.

4641
03:46:02,650 --> 03:46:03,130
Oh!

4642
03:46:06,970 --> 03:46:09,730
It was here the whole time!

4643
03:46:11,070 --> 03:46:11,970
That's so funny.

4644
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:15,830
Maybe I should have used the berry for that moment.

4645
03:46:19,260 --> 03:46:21,360
I don't live, but I do learn.

4646
03:46:23,280 --> 03:46:24,860
Alright, so now we got the blue key.

4647
03:46:25,120 --> 03:46:25,500
So...

4648
03:46:27,960 --> 03:46:28,920
Blue was...

4649
03:46:29,600 --> 03:46:30,080
Ugh!

4650
03:46:32,830 --> 03:46:35,630
I might have to make this my last level though, because...

4651
03:46:35,630 --> 03:46:38,810
My throat is really killing me.

4652
03:46:39,370 --> 03:46:42,070
My throat is killing me.

4653
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:44,550
And I...

4654
03:46:45,530 --> 03:46:47,750
I must confess...

4655
03:46:48,630 --> 03:46:50,190
I'm still sick-y.

4656
03:46:50,490 --> 03:46:52,170
Still sick-y.

4657
03:46:59,670 --> 03:47:00,550
Okay.

4658
03:47:01,990 --> 03:47:02,690
Very cool.

4659
03:47:02,970 --> 03:47:03,110
Oh!

4660
03:47:06,030 --> 03:47:06,470
Oh!

4661
03:47:07,970 --> 03:47:08,850
Oh!

4662
03:47:15,390 --> 03:47:16,610
You're eating through this game?

4663
03:47:16,750 --> 03:47:18,470
I think it's because I chose an easier level.

4664
03:47:18,970 --> 03:47:20,150
Which I thought was normal.

4665
03:47:21,590 --> 03:47:23,210
I really thought it was normal.

4666
03:47:23,330 --> 03:47:24,490
I didn't want to play on easy mode.

4667
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:31,140
Ah!

4668
03:47:55,030 --> 03:47:56,170
Where am I hearing?

4669
03:47:57,710 --> 03:47:58,110
Pinky.

4670
03:47:58,830 --> 03:47:59,450
Right there.

4671
03:48:01,910 --> 03:48:03,190
Are you finishing in one stream?

4672
03:48:03,350 --> 03:48:04,270
No, no, no.

4673
03:48:04,330 --> 03:48:06,470
I have it on my schedule for finishing...

4674
03:48:07,250 --> 03:48:07,650
Um...

4675
03:48:08,190 --> 03:48:08,930
Next Sunday.

4676
03:48:09,010 --> 03:48:09,750
Same time.

4677
03:48:09,750 --> 03:48:10,430
I think.

4678
03:48:10,550 --> 03:48:12,070
I think I have put it at the same time.

4679
03:48:12,230 --> 03:48:13,170
I can't remember actually.

4680
03:48:13,690 --> 03:48:14,510
But um...

4681
03:48:15,950 --> 03:48:17,550
I ate these things!

4682
03:48:19,650 --> 03:48:20,510
But uh...

4683
03:48:21,010 --> 03:48:21,910
I... I...

4684
03:48:23,210 --> 03:48:24,010
Could have...

4685
03:48:24,010 --> 03:48:26,470
If I was feeling better, I would play it in one stream.

4686
03:48:28,890 --> 03:48:29,810
Oh, wait a second.

4687
03:48:33,910 --> 03:48:34,390
Oh!

4688
03:48:37,890 --> 03:48:38,370
Wait...

4689
03:48:44,810 --> 03:48:46,370
I thought I was feeling better though.

4690
03:48:46,790 --> 03:48:47,870
Holy cow!

4691
03:48:50,710 --> 03:48:51,350
Ow!

4692
03:48:51,950 --> 03:48:54,410
He was camping me for real!

4693
03:48:57,430 --> 03:48:58,710
The libraries...

4694
03:48:58,710 --> 03:48:58,830
Oh!

4695
03:48:59,450 --> 03:49:00,330
Oh my goodness.

4696
03:49:01,150 --> 03:49:02,670
I'll unalive you though.

4697
03:49:06,410 --> 03:49:07,250
Unbirth you?

4698
03:49:07,390 --> 03:49:07,790
What was it?

4699
03:49:09,830 --> 03:49:10,510
Woo!

4700
03:49:10,690 --> 03:49:11,510
That was close.

4701
03:49:13,170 --> 03:49:14,450
We're in the library.

4702
03:49:15,010 --> 03:49:16,490
I love the decor.

4703
03:49:16,870 --> 03:49:20,870
I love these tall, like, Nosferatu-looking...

4704
03:49:21,810 --> 03:49:23,470
Goofy guys here.

4705
03:49:24,070 --> 03:49:26,230
And they're every...

4706
03:49:26,230 --> 03:49:26,570
Ow!

4707
03:49:27,550 --> 03:49:29,210
And they're everywhere.

4708
03:49:31,310 --> 03:49:32,710
Oh, it's unbirth.

4709
03:49:33,010 --> 03:49:33,430
Oh, okay.

4710
03:49:35,810 --> 03:49:36,790
Unbirth you!

4711
03:49:37,090 --> 03:49:37,770
Oh!

4712
03:49:37,770 --> 03:49:38,530
Another

4713
03:49:44,980 --> 03:49:46,900
little maze going on in here.

4714
03:49:48,060 --> 03:49:48,940
Oh!

4715
03:49:49,400 --> 03:49:50,520
Never mind.

4716
03:49:55,820 --> 03:49:58,300
Oh, it's unmake!

4717
03:50:07,650 --> 03:50:09,170
Everyone's giving me wrong information!

4718
03:50:23,670 --> 03:50:26,870
Well, you guys kept saying, I'm Bertha, I'm Bertha.

4719
03:50:26,890 --> 03:50:27,430
I was like, oh!

4720
03:50:29,130 --> 03:50:30,730
It must be that one.

4721
03:50:39,230 --> 03:50:40,590
Ew, I'm hearing something.

4722
03:50:44,590 --> 03:50:46,210
Unless it's just the ambience.

4723
03:50:49,610 --> 03:50:51,050
You didn't pin the new schedule on Twitter?

4724
03:50:51,150 --> 03:50:52,110
Yes, I know, I know.

4725
03:50:52,810 --> 03:50:55,230
I haven't posted it on Twitter yet because I...

4726
03:50:57,350 --> 03:50:58,630
I uh...

4727
03:50:59,050 --> 03:51:00,090
Oops, ouch!

4728
03:51:01,770 --> 03:51:03,050
I um...

4729
03:51:03,050 --> 03:51:07,010
I was trying to spread out my tweets a little bit.

4730
03:51:07,650 --> 03:51:10,310
I don't know if you've noticed, but like...

4731
03:51:10,310 --> 03:51:13,090
If I'm just like, oh I have to tweet about...

4732
03:51:13,930 --> 03:51:19,810
Like my waiting room or something, then I'll hold off on posting something else.

4733
03:51:25,470 --> 03:51:26,110
Thank you!

4734
03:51:27,270 --> 03:51:28,490
Do you even know what unbirth means?

4735
03:51:30,910 --> 03:51:31,470
No?

4736
03:51:32,150 --> 03:51:32,710
Wait...

4737
03:51:35,090 --> 03:51:36,430
Wait, no I don't.

4738
03:51:38,910 --> 03:51:40,030
What does it mean?

4739
03:51:40,510 --> 03:51:42,010
I thought it was like...

4740
03:51:42,010 --> 03:51:44,790
I think of... whenever I think of unbirthing...

4741
03:51:44,790 --> 03:51:46,050
I think of...

4742
03:51:47,210 --> 03:51:51,370
Alice in Wonderland, they say a very merry unbirthday.

4743
03:51:52,290 --> 03:51:53,930
So I just think of it as that.

4744
03:51:55,650 --> 03:51:56,210
No...

4745
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:57,970
Don't look it up, okay?

4746
03:52:00,130 --> 03:52:02,030
You guys scare me sometimes.

4747
03:52:03,970 --> 03:52:05,610
You guys scare me sometimes.

4748
03:52:08,730 --> 03:52:09,770
Red key!

4749
03:52:13,230 --> 03:52:14,330
Yeah, they go...

4750
03:52:14,330 --> 03:52:16,410
A very merry unbirthday to...

4751
03:52:16,410 --> 03:52:22,970
A very merry unbirthday to me.

4752
03:52:23,130 --> 03:52:23,930
To me!

4753
03:52:27,570 --> 03:52:30,390
A very merry unbirthday to....

4754
03:52:34,930 --> 03:52:36,210
Oh shoot.

4755
03:52:47,270 --> 03:52:48,610
I hear him...

4756
03:52:48,610 --> 03:52:49,610
I hear him...

4757
03:52:49,610 --> 03:52:49,690
Oh.

4758
03:52:50,790 --> 03:52:51,670
Oh, he's right here.

4759
03:52:52,970 --> 03:52:54,490
Were you here the whole time?

4760
03:53:01,530 --> 03:53:02,750
You're supposed to turn around.

4761
03:53:03,630 --> 03:53:06,190
You're supposed to... Stop circling.

4762
03:53:06,270 --> 03:53:08,250
You're supposed to... You're ruining my plan.

4763
03:53:17,320 --> 03:53:18,500
It's a fetish term.

4764
03:53:18,880 --> 03:53:20,980
Think of it as like a reverse of birth.

4765
03:53:23,620 --> 03:53:26,020
A very merry unbirthing to you two.

4766
03:53:26,240 --> 03:53:26,720
Stop!

4767
03:53:27,960 --> 03:53:28,440
Stop!

4768
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:30,060
Now I know what it means, I think!

4769
03:53:30,540 --> 03:53:32,780
I actually don't know what it means though.

4770
03:53:35,060 --> 03:53:39,320
So do you pretend like... Do you pretend to be like the placenta?

4771
03:53:41,580 --> 03:53:42,300
And stuff?

4772
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,740
I wonder.

4773
03:53:46,700 --> 03:53:47,860
How do I get... Oh, here.

4774
03:53:51,740 --> 03:53:54,120
Alright, red door was...

4775
03:53:55,760 --> 03:53:57,680
I mean, we were all there once.

4776
03:53:58,100 --> 03:54:00,300
Some people just want to return to...

4777
03:54:01,340 --> 03:54:02,440
To baby.

4778
03:54:07,610 --> 03:54:09,210
Where was a red door?

4779
03:54:09,690 --> 03:54:11,190
Or was it a red switch?

4780
03:54:11,530 --> 03:54:12,490
I can't... Oh!

4781
03:54:12,650 --> 03:54:13,550
Red door!

4782
03:54:15,890 --> 03:54:17,790
This looks like a boss area.

4783
03:54:19,390 --> 03:54:20,030
Ow!

4784
03:54:23,470 --> 03:54:24,190
There we go.

4785
03:54:28,310 --> 03:54:29,510
Is that it?

4786
03:54:29,630 --> 03:54:30,630
Was it just that guy?

4787
03:54:31,450 --> 03:54:33,050
And some fire in the middle?

4788
03:54:36,130 --> 03:54:37,170
Uh-oh.

4789
03:54:43,630 --> 03:54:45,050
Wait, I didn't mean to pick this one.

4790
03:54:47,750 --> 03:54:49,710
Let's pick the un...

4791
03:54:50,610 --> 03:54:51,130
Unmaker.

4792
03:54:52,230 --> 03:54:54,550
I'll remember its name from now on.

4793
03:54:54,590 --> 03:54:55,050
I'm sorry.

4794
03:54:59,310 --> 03:55:01,390
The design of this room is awesome, right?

4795
03:55:01,630 --> 03:55:02,630
It's so cool.

4796
03:55:04,370 --> 03:55:04,970
Okay.

4797
03:55:05,110 --> 03:55:06,150
Box of rockets.

4798
03:55:07,090 --> 03:55:07,690
Shotgun.

4799
03:55:08,150 --> 03:55:09,310
Did I grab everything?

4800
03:55:09,550 --> 03:55:10,850
I can't... My health is...

4801
03:55:10,850 --> 03:55:11,790
Okay.

4802
03:55:11,970 --> 03:55:12,450
Cool.

4803
03:55:14,430 --> 03:55:15,030
Okay.

4804
03:55:15,030 --> 03:55:16,390
Okay, mister.

4805
03:55:18,130 --> 03:55:20,850
They locked you in there for a reason, I think.

4806
03:55:22,990 --> 03:55:24,210
Nobody likes you.

4807
03:55:27,950 --> 03:55:29,010
Nobody likes you.

4808
03:55:29,010 --> 03:55:29,190
Nobody invited you.

4809
03:55:31,650 --> 03:55:32,210
Yippee!

4810
03:55:32,590 --> 03:55:34,490
That was 100% our fault.

4811
03:55:35,050 --> 03:55:35,950
Yeah, it was.

4812
03:55:36,910 --> 03:55:39,150
There's an indie game called The Citadel.

4813
03:55:39,330 --> 03:55:41,010
Oh, yes, I do know The Citadel.

4814
03:55:42,010 --> 03:55:44,170
It's classic Doom with hot anime girls.

4815
03:55:44,250 --> 03:55:45,370
I do know it, actually.

4816
03:55:47,090 --> 03:55:47,650
Unbirthing.

4817
03:55:47,690 --> 03:55:48,210
One word.

4818
03:55:48,770 --> 03:55:49,330
Shlurp.

4819
03:55:49,650 --> 03:55:50,430
I'm sorry.

4820
03:55:52,050 --> 03:55:53,790
I don't know what's going on.

4821
03:55:54,730 --> 03:55:55,770
100% kills.

4822
03:55:55,890 --> 03:55:56,930
72% items.

4823
03:55:57,090 --> 03:55:57,990
Zero secrets.

4824
03:55:58,210 --> 03:55:58,710
So sad.

4825
03:55:59,830 --> 03:56:01,570
The Eye of the Storm.

4826
03:56:04,290 --> 03:56:05,370
I know that.

4827
03:56:05,410 --> 03:56:06,670
I said that was my last game.

4828
03:56:08,870 --> 03:56:11,990
I just want to take that guy out while he's not paying attention.

4829
03:56:12,450 --> 03:56:12,870
Okay.

4830
03:56:14,410 --> 03:56:15,450
Okie-dokie.

4831
03:56:15,470 --> 03:56:16,310
I think I am going to...

4832
03:56:17,130 --> 03:56:18,550
finish here, though.

4833
03:56:18,630 --> 03:56:20,250
And then we'll finish...

4834
03:56:20,430 --> 03:56:21,550
next week.

4835
03:56:25,750 --> 03:56:27,690
Mint knows The Citadel based.

4836
03:56:28,690 --> 03:56:30,930
The Citadel is also cursed in a way I never expected.

4837
03:56:31,030 --> 03:56:31,230
Really?

4838
03:56:31,670 --> 03:56:32,970
I've only heard of it.

4839
03:56:33,050 --> 03:56:34,210
I don't know much about it.

4840
03:56:35,670 --> 03:56:38,190
But Iron Lung has the same musical composer.

4841
03:56:38,490 --> 03:56:38,970
Is this game?

4842
03:56:39,510 --> 03:56:41,530
Maybe that's why all the ambiance is really good.

4843
03:56:43,210 --> 03:56:45,730
Gosh, my nose is so itchy right now.

4844
03:56:46,250 --> 03:56:47,530
I hate being sick.

4845
03:56:48,650 --> 03:56:50,410
I hate that my throat is hurting all the time.

4846
03:56:53,110 --> 03:56:55,110
I hate that I'm still not recovered.

4847
03:56:55,510 --> 03:56:55,950
Goodbye.

4848
03:56:56,150 --> 03:56:56,890
Wiping today.

4849
03:56:57,070 --> 03:56:57,510
Ghosty.

4850
03:56:57,510 --> 03:56:58,410
Hope you're feeling better soon.

4851
03:56:58,550 --> 03:56:59,110
Thank you.

4852
03:56:59,310 --> 03:56:59,910
Thank you.

4853
03:56:59,930 --> 03:57:00,350
Thank you.

4854
03:57:00,610 --> 03:57:01,430
It's 4 AM.

4855
03:57:01,510 --> 03:57:02,330
Can I finally go to bed?

4856
03:57:02,410 --> 03:57:02,990
Yes, Android.

4857
03:57:03,170 --> 03:57:03,730
Go to bed.

4858
03:57:05,890 --> 03:57:06,670
Go to bed.

4859
03:57:07,370 --> 03:57:09,290
Of course you would be here for Doom.

4860
03:57:12,570 --> 03:57:15,350
Tomorrow I'll be doing DLC of...

4861
03:57:15,350 --> 03:57:16,690
I decided to do...

4862
03:57:17,190 --> 03:57:19,470
Rather than like splitting it up like one...

4863
03:57:19,470 --> 03:57:21,610
Part one week and one part the next week.

4864
03:57:22,250 --> 03:57:23,290
Since I...

4865
03:57:23,290 --> 03:57:23,890
It's...

4866
03:57:23,890 --> 03:57:26,930
I played Outer Wilds somewhat recently.

4867
03:57:27,150 --> 03:57:30,250
And so the information is still kind of fresh in my brain.

4868
03:57:30,630 --> 03:57:32,630
But I want to play...

4869
03:57:34,270 --> 03:57:36,190
I wanted to play...

4870
03:57:37,350 --> 03:57:39,370
While it's still fresh in my...

4871
03:57:39,370 --> 03:57:40,090
In my head.

4872
03:57:41,390 --> 03:57:42,150
So yeah.

4873
03:57:42,830 --> 03:57:43,810
Thanks for the stream.

4874
03:57:43,930 --> 03:57:44,750
Thank you guys!

4875
03:57:44,930 --> 03:57:46,210
Thanks for hanging out.

4876
03:57:46,390 --> 03:57:47,850
Thanks for returning to Doom Mint.

4877
03:57:47,930 --> 03:57:49,070
My podcast merch just arrived.

4878
03:57:49,070 --> 03:57:50,030
It's so good.

4879
03:57:50,510 --> 03:57:52,250
Thank you, Doomed Fireman!

4880
03:57:53,430 --> 03:57:54,150
Thank you, Marilyn.

4881
03:57:54,550 --> 03:57:55,650
Glad you're having fun with Doom 64.

4882
03:57:55,850 --> 03:57:57,810
I know that you will love Doom 3 when you get around to it.

4883
03:57:57,850 --> 03:57:58,430
I hope you feel better soon.

4884
03:57:58,850 --> 03:57:59,470
Thank you!

4885
03:57:59,650 --> 03:58:00,410
Oh my gosh, yeah.

4886
03:58:01,810 --> 03:58:02,470
Doom 3.

4887
03:58:03,250 --> 03:58:03,970
And then...

4888
03:58:03,970 --> 03:58:04,450
I do...

4889
03:58:04,450 --> 03:58:06,250
Like I said, I do want to play like Doom Eternal.

4890
03:58:06,870 --> 03:58:08,470
I want to get to...

4891
03:58:08,850 --> 03:58:09,210
The...

4892
03:58:09,210 --> 03:58:11,710
The new Doom really inspired me.

4893
03:58:11,790 --> 03:58:12,590
So I'm like...

4894
03:58:12,590 --> 03:58:16,130
But I'm not a Doom player unless I play all the Dooms.

4895
03:58:21,590 --> 03:58:29,750
If you're planning on revisiting Doom or Doom 2, will you be willing to play them on Brutal Doom or even Project Brutality?

4896
03:58:31,570 --> 03:58:32,050
Hmm...

4897
03:58:35,570 --> 03:58:36,050
Hmm...

4898
03:58:36,590 --> 03:58:37,070
Hmm...

4899
03:58:37,070 --> 03:58:37,190
Hmm...

4900
03:58:37,190 --> 03:58:38,350
I'll think about it.

4901
03:58:38,770 --> 03:58:43,150
I think I need to get a bit better before I up my level too much though.

4902
03:58:44,730 --> 03:58:45,570
You're a Doomer?

4903
03:58:45,670 --> 03:58:46,670
Name all the Doom games.

4904
03:58:46,950 --> 03:58:48,170
I'm a Doom scroller.

4905
03:58:48,210 --> 03:58:49,030
I'm a Doomer.

4906
03:58:49,490 --> 03:58:50,130
I'm a...

4907
03:58:50,130 --> 03:58:51,110
I'm a Boomer.

4908
03:58:53,470 --> 03:58:55,030
Oh my god, I wonder if I...

4909
03:58:55,030 --> 03:58:55,870
I wonder if I...

4910
03:58:55,870 --> 03:58:56,410
So I'm...

4911
03:58:57,130 --> 03:58:58,630
I wonder if I still have that.

4912
03:58:59,350 --> 03:59:00,690
I used to have...

4913
03:59:07,450 --> 03:59:11,490
The Doom logo but it said Boomer instead of Doomer.

4914
03:59:16,050 --> 03:59:17,110
I wonder if...

4915
03:59:17,110 --> 03:59:18,010
I should still have it.

4916
03:59:18,030 --> 03:59:19,590
I don't think I would delete it.

4917
03:59:20,750 --> 03:59:22,290
Sorry if you can hear me crunching.

4918
03:59:23,170 --> 03:59:23,610
Oh my god.

4919
03:59:23,630 --> 03:59:24,770
Oh, I do still have it!

4920
03:59:28,590 --> 03:59:29,470
Me!

4921
03:59:32,350 --> 03:59:32,790
Boomer.

4922
03:59:41,750 --> 03:59:43,230
Can we call you...

4923
03:59:43,890 --> 03:59:44,850
The what guy?

4924
03:59:45,170 --> 03:59:46,770
The phantom guy?

4925
03:59:48,370 --> 03:59:49,130
Yeah, perfect.

4926
03:59:49,870 --> 03:59:50,750
Boomer.

4927
03:59:53,550 --> 03:59:55,310
Boomer eternally.

4928
03:59:58,050 --> 03:59:59,710
Aren't we all boomers at this point?

4929
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:00,470
Well, get it?

4930
04:00:00,510 --> 04:00:01,070
Because I'm a...

4931
04:00:01,890 --> 04:00:02,370
BOOMER.

4932
04:00:04,110 --> 04:00:04,790
Get it?

4933
04:00:04,810 --> 04:00:05,550
Because I say boo.

4934
04:00:06,090 --> 04:00:06,990
Because I'm a ghost.

4935
04:00:07,710 --> 04:00:09,570
I'm not a boomer like you guys.

4936
04:00:09,690 --> 04:00:10,270
I'm a...

4937
04:00:11,770 --> 04:00:12,250
BOOMER.

4938
04:00:14,930 --> 04:00:17,210
Today you are the baby mode boomer.

4939
04:00:17,210 --> 04:00:17,390
No!

4940
04:00:18,410 --> 04:00:20,050
Stop judging my baby mode!

4941
04:00:20,790 --> 04:00:22,290
I really thought...

4942
04:00:22,290 --> 04:00:24,690
I really truly thought that I was playing on normal.

4943
04:00:25,310 --> 04:00:25,930
That's okay.

4944
04:00:26,090 --> 04:00:27,290
I'm still having fun with it.

4945
04:00:30,590 --> 04:00:31,030
Unsubbed.

4946
04:00:31,270 --> 04:00:31,710
STOP!

4947
04:00:36,360 --> 04:00:38,520
You still need to play the 62 Doom games.

4948
04:00:38,860 --> 04:00:40,100
Between 2 and 64.

4949
04:00:40,880 --> 04:00:41,520
Oh boy.

4950
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:43,440
Yup.

4951
04:00:43,900 --> 04:00:46,180
I guess I'm a... I'm a Doom YouTuber now.

4952
04:00:46,280 --> 04:00:47,360
I'm a Doom VTuber now.

4953
04:00:48,320 --> 04:00:48,760
Drop!

4954
04:00:48,780 --> 04:00:49,480
Welcome to membership.

4955
04:00:49,640 --> 04:00:50,060
Thank you!

4956
04:00:52,740 --> 04:00:56,280
I would stick around and talk more, but my throat is really starting to hurt.

4957
04:00:56,400 --> 04:00:56,840
So...

4958
04:00:57,260 --> 04:00:59,420
I think I am gonna call it here.

4959
04:00:59,720 --> 04:01:01,320
I hope you guys had a good weekend.

4960
04:01:01,700 --> 04:01:02,660
And um...

4961
04:01:04,160 --> 04:01:05,740
Sorry that I couldn't stream this yesterday.

4962
04:01:06,040 --> 04:01:06,560
But uh...

4963
04:01:06,560 --> 04:01:07,980
Glad that I could stream it today.

4964
04:01:08,320 --> 04:01:10,160
I've got a full full week ahead of us.

4965
04:01:10,600 --> 04:01:12,400
So um... lots of stuff.

4966
04:01:13,680 --> 04:01:16,280
Aren't there 61 games between 2 and 64?

4967
04:01:22,070 --> 04:01:23,150
I'm not a scientist.

4968
04:01:24,310 --> 04:01:25,270
Coyote Actual!

4969
04:01:25,330 --> 04:01:26,450
Welcome back for two months!

4970
04:01:26,570 --> 04:01:27,090
Thank you!

4971
04:01:27,910 --> 04:01:28,390
Mmm.

4972
04:01:28,990 --> 04:01:29,950
But hopefully...

4973
04:01:29,950 --> 04:01:31,750
I'll be feeling better this week.

4974
04:01:31,930 --> 04:01:34,330
And all that fun stuff.

4975
04:01:34,730 --> 04:01:36,470
So I'll rest lots.

4976
04:01:36,710 --> 04:01:37,330
I will.

4977
04:01:37,450 --> 04:01:40,110
I'll rest lots so that I can feel better.

4978
04:01:41,070 --> 04:01:41,950
And um...

4979
04:01:41,950 --> 04:01:44,790
Have lots of fun with all my streams this week!

4980
04:01:45,050 --> 04:01:45,370
Yippee!

4981
04:01:46,450 --> 04:01:48,430
Minto, I got some good news and some bad news.

4982
04:01:48,470 --> 04:01:49,530
Bad news, I broke my wrist.

4983
04:01:49,670 --> 04:01:50,110
Oh no!

4984
04:01:50,310 --> 04:01:52,410
Good news, I get to watch you live more often.

4985
04:01:53,070 --> 04:01:53,510
Yippee!

4986
04:01:54,590 --> 04:01:55,630
Are you okay?

4987
04:01:57,030 --> 04:01:58,490
No, Mr. McVeigh.

4988
04:01:58,490 --> 04:02:00,830
I hope you feel better too.

4989
04:02:02,170 --> 04:02:03,270
Let's have a good week!

4990
04:02:03,310 --> 04:02:04,210
This week, everybody!

4991
04:02:04,990 --> 04:02:05,290
Yippee!

4992
04:02:06,590 --> 04:02:07,590
Thank you, Minto.

4993
04:02:07,690 --> 04:02:08,490
No, thank you!

4994
04:02:09,490 --> 04:02:10,410
Otsu, Minto!

4995
04:02:10,770 --> 04:02:11,850
Otsu, Bustin'.

4996
04:02:11,850 --> 04:02:12,730
Otsu, Boomer.

4997
04:02:13,190 --> 04:02:13,810
Otsu, Doomer.

4998
04:02:14,030 --> 04:02:16,210
And I'll see you guys tomorrow for...

4999
04:02:16,210 --> 04:02:17,590
Outer Wilds.

5000
04:02:19,150 --> 04:02:20,530
Echoes... Echoes of the Eye?

5001
04:02:20,650 --> 04:02:21,570
Eye of the Echoes?

5002
04:02:21,710 --> 04:02:22,550
Echoes of the Eye.

5003
04:02:23,270 --> 04:02:23,790
Echo...

5004
04:02:24,670 --> 04:02:25,970
Can't remember the name.

5005
04:02:27,350 --> 04:02:28,210
Otsu, Minto!

5006
04:02:28,210 --> 04:02:29,550
Otsu, Bustin'.

5007
04:02:29,550 --> 04:02:30,830
Thank you, guys!

5008
04:02:31,210 --> 04:02:32,450
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5009
04:02:32,590 --> 04:02:34,270
I'm gonna go rest my throat now.

5010
04:02:36,290 --> 04:02:37,430
It's like right...

5011
04:02:37,430 --> 04:02:38,770
It's like not my throat.

5012
04:02:38,850 --> 04:02:40,210
It's like the back of my mouth.

5013
04:02:40,310 --> 04:02:41,090
It hurts so bad.

5014
04:02:41,390 --> 04:02:41,870
Okay.

5015
04:02:42,070 --> 04:02:42,730
Bye-bye!

5016
04:02:42,790 --> 04:02:43,890
Thanks for watching, you guys!

5017
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:44,730
Thanks for hanging out!

5018
04:02:46,330 --> 04:02:47,290
Bye-bye!

5019
04:04:18,450 --> 04:04:20,630
Thank you for the super chat!

5020
04:04:21,850 --> 04:04:24,230
Tobas, I hope you had a good day!

5021
04:04:24,890 --> 04:04:25,370
I

5022
04:04:31,920 --> 04:04:32,600
hope you had a good day!

5023
04:04:32,600 --> 04:04:35,800
Thank you everybody.

5024
04:04:35,920 --> 04:04:37,700
See you guys tomorrow!

5025
04:04:39,240 --> 04:04:39,940
Bye-bye!

5026
04:04:39,940 --> 04:04:41,480
Thank you!

5027
04:04:41,480 --> 04:04:41,940
Bye-bye!

5028
04:04:42,540 --> 04:04:43,000
Bye-bye!
