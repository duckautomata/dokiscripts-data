00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,250
Hello, hello.

7
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,460
Hi, Minto.

8
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,900
Doctor, turn off my mint inhibitors.

9
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,200
What would happen?

10
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,160
Hmm.

11
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,940
What would happen if you turned off your minty inhibitors?

12
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,640
Go full mint.

13
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,620
Extra minty, extra freaky.

14
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,440
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

15
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,780
Oh my gosh, Jordan, thank you.

16
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,860
That was my birthday yesterday.

17
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:06,440

fresh to wear to Framinto with Love on February 13th, which

18
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,340

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,080
It will.

20
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,500

21
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Happy birthday!

22
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,040
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry that I missed it yesterday.

23
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,900
Happy birthday, Jordan!

24
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,200

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,220

35
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,080

I know it's in your head.

38
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:55,460
You're thinking about, you're thinking about big old
buttoxes, a round variety.

39
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,160
A cake that is juicy and moist.

40
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,740
It's stuck in there.

41
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,640
Thinking about, thinking about a squishy buns.

42
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,300

43
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,480

44
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,240
I think, I think, I think, My booty...

45
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,740

46
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,500
That's all.

47
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,680
Panzwan!

48
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,460
I wanted to say it's my birthday!

49
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,980
Thank you for another wonderful year and hope the next one
is even better.

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,300

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,000

63
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,260
Hello, Mito.

64
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,760
Hello, I-Boo's.

65
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
I-Boo's, I-Boo's.

66
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,220
I wanted to ask when you possess someone, does anything
physically change about them?

67
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,880
Like eye color, hair gradient, getting 10 centimeters
shorter, etc.

68
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,780
I don't think so.

69
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,180
Next time I possess somebody, I'll look in the mirror.

70
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,600
Maybe you get to my stunning blue eyes.

71
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,280
Oh, my gosh.

72
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,560

little they're blue but they're a little darker but like

73
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:40,220
memes of people with like bright blue eyes are so funny i
hope they get the bakery but no your your body's not gonna

74
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:51,620
change any at all that would be oh my gosh talk about some
growing pains that'd be so bad That would be terrible.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,460
That would be, like, body horror, I think.

76
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,660
And I don't possess for very long, usually.

77
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,280
So it's like...

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sick today from watching you.

79
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,640
It always makes me feel better.

80
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Tachibana, feel better.

81
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,370
Feel better for a bottle for a bottle, chie-a.

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Feel better.

83
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,920
Having a great time seeing your choices that you make me do.

84
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,720

87
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,120

88
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,240

I saw Nimi played it too.

134
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,460
But yeah, so I was just kind of...

135
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,680
I was like, ooh, ooh.

136
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,160

140
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,480
Someone whose number one most watched game on YouTube last
year was Nancy Drew just because of your streams.

141
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,920
This is very good news to me.

142
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, baby.

143
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,380
I thought about... So, sorry, I bring up Nimi again.

144
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:34,740
just obsessed with her but um there will be uh times when
i'm gone in march i have a a particularly long longer uh

145
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:44,640
trip trip to japan and then right after i just got announced
for carrier con so um i will be there and um so it's a bit

146
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:53,540
of a longer uh trip for me i do plan on bringing my travel
set up so that i can stream when i can but similarly to how

147
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,400
When Nimi went on vacation and she did Outer Wilds
playthrough, I was like thinking maybe I could do Nancy

148
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,740
Drew.

149
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:09,000
And maybe I could have like a Nancy Drew game that I
complete or something as a let's play in between times that

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,860
I can stream.

151
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,160
So I plan on streaming, but it just won't be so much.

152
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,700
But I will at least have that kind of.

153
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,900
It's a busy...

154
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,460
It's a busy next couple of months for me, guys.

Duckie.

176
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Booby.

177
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,400
Booby.

178
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Yeah.

179
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,780
We're gonna.

180
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,420
The new travel setup looks so cool.

181
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,780
Thank you.

182
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,300
For those that didn't see.

183
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,200
I posted.

184
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
I got a mini piece.

185
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,440
Okay.

186
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,420
So, backing up a little bit.

187
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,820
I've been using a mini PC for, like, certain games.

188
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,420
Like, I used it for Harvester.

189
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,560
I used it for...

190
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,180
One shot.

191
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,340
There was one more, though.

192
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,120
Ha, da, ka.

193
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,880
Before we get to the game, a couple of annoying questions.

194
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,300
Any plans on checking out the new block game?

195
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,900
High Tail.

196
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,480
It's all the rage now.

197
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,920
I haven't heard of that.

198
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,540
And two, thoughts on Orbology.

199
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,920
Orb.

200
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Orb.

201
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,740
But Druids, yes, thank you.

202
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,040
Druids.

203
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,940
I will check out New Block Game.

204
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,300
I have not heard of it, though.

205
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,500
It's basically Minecraft 2.

206
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,440
You haven't heard about it?

207
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,920
Mm-mm.

208
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
I'll check it out.

209
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,220
I love Minecraft.

210
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,220
In Minecraft 2, maybe.

211
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,060
At the risk of backseating, I'm turning into VOD Squad.

212
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,560
Have fun, everyone.

213
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
I don't mind.

214
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,700
I honestly don't mind if people try to backseat and try to
give advice.

215
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,800
I think, you know, this is my opinion.

216
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Obviously, and this is just my, like I said, it's my
opinion, not every streamer is going to think the same way.

217
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,020
I don't mind if people are trying to help.

218
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:01,720
i think it's up to the streamer's discretion whether they
want to follow that or not like in this for example in like

219
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:12,160
a game like this like i could i could you know i could poll
you guys for every decision each time um and say okay what's

220
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:21,920
the majority all right we'll do that or i could you know um
another time i i think probably the only time that back

221
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:29,140
sitting most annoys me is if I'm like trying to solve a
puzzle and if I don't get it within the first five seconds

222
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,240
if somebody like goes into the chat and spoils it and I'm
you know I can like not look at chat for things like that

223
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,700
but I also just kind of enjoy your guys's company so I I
can't help it I just look over sometimes I think that's uh

224
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:56,380
the most annoying thing for me and I guess the other but I
think it's because I'm usually getting frustrated at a game

225
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:04,160
is like if I'm playing like a fighting like a game with
combat and I'm like oh my gosh I can't get this thing I

226
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,560
don't know how to do it and people are like trying to
explain and I'm like I'm trying but that's just because I'm

227
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:24,160
frustrated in the moment it's not even like a it's like you
guys are just trying to help but I'm like as a viewer I

228
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,840
don't mind backseating but people complaining about you not
listening to them it's kind of irritating i get that too you

229
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,960
know it's okay to just turn off chat and enjoy the ride as
well free tuber do this instead why yeah

230
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:50,780
i think with these kinds of games like the story driven uh
choose your own adventure types a lot of people just get so

231
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:58,060
enthusiastic they're just like i played this game and when i
played it choices I picked mean you have a really really fun

232
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,480
time and so you'll have a really really fun time if you
choose the same exact choices that I made so just cater to

233
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:21,860
my choices you know what I mean or thank you so much for the
five gift thank you um but uh you know um yeah that's just

234
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:30,780
uh you know accidents no sorry i was just thinking about it
today because you know i i understand that people get really

235
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:40,040
excited and uh i i obviously do have to put my foot down
sometimes and be like hey hey you guys happy to see you this

236
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:49,240
project today thank you gopoo i actually haven't played it
but the game return of the oberdin i have played that wide

237
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,900
oh my gosh it's really it's really interesting It's really
fine.

238
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,720
It's difficult, though.

239
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,100
That's a tough game.

240
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,320
That's a really, really tough game.

241
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,680
It's really cool, though.

242
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,280
It's very, very cool.

243
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,760
Um, but yeah.

244
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,880
You should put your foot down more often, Minto.

245
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,660
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

246
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm gonna put my foot down.

247
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,260
And then I'm gonna spit on the person on the ground.

248
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,540
to me yeah

249
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:38,970
I'll say stay down stay down I hear more streamers should
put their foot down more often I think people a lot of

250
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:54,770
streamers get very scared of of how to say just like I guess
offending people not offending just like scaring off their

251
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:03,590
audience you know what i mean yeah the backlash i think a
lot of people get freaked out about it um because you know

252
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,170
if you're getting frustrated about something that's
happening it's very easy to lose your cool lose your temper

253
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:16,990
about it and you know be like i said this i said stop it and
it comes out the wrong way and then people are like ew

254
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,110
terrible streamer

255
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,450
But you're a ghost.

256
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,370
What are you going to put your foot down on?

257
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,770
I guess you would...

258
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,750
Would you feel it?

259
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,430
I would concentrate...

260
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,630
Okay.

261
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:34,690
Okay.

262
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:41,150
I would concentrate all my spiritual energy into my leg.

263
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:50,690
And it might be a little silly because I would become
literally like a ball of energy with one really beefy leg.

264
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,370
And then you would feel it.

265
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,430
It would be...

266
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,130
Yeah, I would look like Ibu, but with a really big, little
beefy leg.

267
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,150
Because all of my spiritual energy, I would lose the ability
to, like, conjure up a form, as you see me now.

268
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,110
Being a ghost is so difficult, you guys.

269
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,290
You don't understand.

270
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,690
Or just write that down.

271
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,430
I have the sudden urge to tell you what to do.

272
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,410
Don't boss me around.

273
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,030
You're not my ma'am.

274
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,410
Just so you can give her the super time.

275
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,570
It's important to set boundaries.

276
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,670
Yeah, I think I, I think, well, I think.

277
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,530
I don't know.

278
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,250
Legs.

279
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,630
Except leg.

280
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,950
Because it'd be one leg.

281
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,670
Because I'm just putting my foot down.

282
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,330
She got the cake and the game.

283
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,510
I think I'll have a leg of beef for dinner.

284
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,970
White screen waiting room.

285
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,750
Chat, we need to have a talk.

286
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,070
Wait, I'm confused.

287
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:06,770
What's it about?

288
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,250
Wait, what are we talking about?

289
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,710
Huh?

290
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,530
Am I getting grounded?

291
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,790
Wait, what's happening?

292
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,750
What do we have to talk about?

293
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,140
Serious chat?

294
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:37,520
with talk wait serious talks with chat every day is leg day
minto uh not not not usually okay sometimes i don't even

have like little wispy bottom you can't see it anyway

296
00:23:51,260 --> 00:24:01,720
announcement parentheses yep It's what it's exactly what you
think about what you're thinking Putting this stream on for

297
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,800
sleep noise is dangerous because I'm invested in this story
But I'll try to sleep have a great stream binto good night

298
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,780
song kid I'll try not to yell or scream or cry or shout or
exclaim or

299
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,760
Please do all of those things Scream every word.

300
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,880
Today I'm taking up a heavy metal.

301
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,000
You're absolutely not Orbital Vagabond, I believe you.

302
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,760
Put your foot down.

303
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,220
If I get out of hand, you can kick me in the butt.

304
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,100
In fact, you can just wedge it up there.

305
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,180
Really teach me a lesson.

306
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,160
Put me in my place.

307
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
No ulterior motive.

308
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,360
Okay.

309
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,280
Hanaka-saku!

310
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,100
Thank you so much for the fight!

311
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,120
Get the...

312
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Scream and yell more!

313
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,440
Hello!

314
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,780
Shall we get into it though?

315
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,980
Shall we beat the game?

316
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,700
Shall we complete the game?

317
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,280
I like how the... Wait, what happened to the...

318
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,340
What happened to the vending machine?

319
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,400
Oh no!

320
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,420
Oh no!

321
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,320
Wait, oh before then, let's go over our choice stats as we
did before.

322
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,780
So we added Water Boy to our team.

323
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,240
And we did have dinner with Blonde Blazer, except right
there she's Bruna.

324
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,960
It's a little misleading.

325
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,420
We did throw spaghetti because it's the more delicious
choice.

326
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:16,040
uh we warned her about her dress and she really appreciated
it because she went on a date with us um we didn't we did

327
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,320
not uh tell him about kissing blonde blazer i thought he was
gonna kill me i thought he was gonna murder me but

328
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:33,420
apparently if i told him it would just be yaoi oh well um we
adopted the baby kaiju um we failed the brain teaser that

329
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:40,660
was my fault i did i so someone in the comment i got a
comment on last stream they were like yeah um all of the

330
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:49,440
things were like games that telltale games have made like
the wolf among us isn't that what it's called and then the

331
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,800
walking dead i was like i for some reason i didn't even
think that it was like an opposite because i think it was

332
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:06,180
like the living walk or something i don't know i was like oh
yeah it's like wolf amogus amogus i was like oh my gosh i

333
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,100
didn't even realize that they're like opposites of the title
names i just thought it was like a silly version of the

334
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:20,900
title just not the actual like walking dead or something
like that so wolf inside us no i thought just like random

335
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:30,900
synonyms of the titles me too that's why i was like oh shoot
oh well that's okay where our set uh And I performed better

336
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,920
than 40% of players in today's shift.

337
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,000
Wait, does that mean I'm good?

338
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,560
I don't understand statistics.

339
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,120
I failed that class.

340
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,220
So here we...

341
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,980
You with 20% of players told the Z-Team you were just
Robert.

342
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,820
Oh my gosh, I can't wait.

343
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,660
I can't wait for the drama to come from this.

344
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,700
Ooh, everybody was so mad that I wasn't honest.

345
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,420
But can you...

346
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,020
Oh my gosh, everybody was so shocked.

347
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,900
to hear that we were just that we were mecca man at the
party and they were like oh and it's gonna be oh my god it's

348
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:21,400
gonna be drama and then we went on a second date with amandy
which that hasn't happened yet so um i would kill shroud and

349
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:30,980
then just um my most sent hero was invisible and physical
and then episode six we were oh yeah i was ready to send

350
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,740
them in because i have confidence And I have confidence in
my dispatch abilities.

351
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,840
But clearly, nobody else does.

352
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:48,440
Maybe I shouldn't have said that because it went against
blonde blazer.

353
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,320
It was like more siding with Envisagal.

354
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,880
But I think I'm just that good.

355
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,120
Bunch of non-believers.

356
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,660
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

357
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,040
Going against your girlfriend.

358
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:13,240
I don't are we officially dating like are we going out I
thought we were just testing the waters I mean we did kiss

359
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:28,580
if you kiss someone does that mean you're dating how does it
work you literally kissed in the sky no yes what if in my

360
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:42,120
brain if I kiss somebody if then I'm dating them my brain
maybe wait you're practically married i think so too i think

361
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:53,740
we should start uh we should open up a joint bank account i
think it's time i think we're at that point and you know it

362
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:02,340
doesn't mean dating but you do get pregnant scary ask for a
prenup i think she has more money than I do.

363
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,940
I think she would want the prenup.

364
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,560
Actually, I think we're broke.

365
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,740
um, I think she would want the prenup.

366
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,000
Uh, yeah.

367
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,580
Imagine blonde blazer, but MGS 3 Eva outfit.

368
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,260
I like that.

369
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,220
I like that.

370
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,600
like that a lot.

371
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,860
I don't know why I was worried about missing anything while
having dinner at 7.

372
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,060
I should have known my Oshie is the app master 5000.

373
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,900
Wait a second.

374
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,400

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,740
We're giving a recap of the game.

379
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,760

380
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,090

not be good for you I think I imagine it would be like a

398
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,170
motion sick Disneyness

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,120
Keep up.

409
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,260

Uh oh.

411
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,760

dad never being home whoa motherfucker language oh he's

bitch, too.

416
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,220
Are you saying I'm crying like a bitch?

417
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,620
Yes, bitch.

418
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,160
That's exactly what I'm saying.

419
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,460
Jesse, that's where he learned this language.

420
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,580
Your dad gave me a hundred, and I gotta break the shit
anyway.

421
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,220
He pays you?

422
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,240
To be around your crying bitch ass?

423
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,720
Fuck yeah, he pays me.

424
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,520
Oh my god, language, though.

425
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,120
Now, come on, whatever you want.

426
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,840
Just make it less than $20.

427
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:01,980
Twinkies!

428
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,460
Wait, I should have said a cigar.

429
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,780
Can I get a cigar?

430
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:18,680
twinkie hey because you're crying you can have two ah that
could have had two cigars no shit kid i was joking keep up

431
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:32,380
oh he is way too fast did he ever realize that he was like
accelerated aging because of his stuff or until it was like

432
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:46,560
too late i wonder you happy now yeah well yeah you can be
sad like not until it's too late so stinky I didn't realize

433
00:35:46,560 --> 00:36:00,500
you two were that close that it went back that far no he's
alive he's not well he's uh I was lost for a while I was

434
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:08,100
obsessed with making the mecha man thing work extreme focus
you know one step in of the other.

435
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,860
I thought it was going to cut to a funeral.

436
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,740
I'm not going to lie.

437
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,800
I didn't know where I was.

438
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,840
I'm sorry.

439
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,080
Chase had only babysit nights when dad had to deal with
something big.

440
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,280
Working late, he called him.

441
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,180
I was fine being alone, but I'd still ask to have him wash
me because I could guilt trip him into buying me shut.

442
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,780
He never said no.

443
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,960
What if I asked for a cigar?

444
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,760
What do you have said no?

445
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,260
I made him run a lot back then right so maybe one less door
run for bitch-ass Robert and he wouldn't be stuck in here

446
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:55,980
that's what you're saying right I mean it was but now that
you put it like that he'd buy him he gets whatever you

447
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:05,560
choose that's crazy here pending the investigation in
Visigal suspended obviously but I think you should consider

448
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:20,060
cutting her from the team I'm not saying you should I'm just
saying you should consider it I'll get back to you I really

449
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:28,280
don't want to think about it right now that's fair of course
yeah it's just I can't help but think that we've already cut

450
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,960
a hero for far less we had to send a message that's kind of
my point

451
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:56,560
and better we can cut her vending machine whatever I want
whatever I want he's so fucking proud of the man you've

452
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:08,840
become he told me that oh oh I wanted a like princess
carried me.

453
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,470
What?

454
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,900
I mean, I guess he just, like, his dad's passing was, like,
not so long ago, so.

455
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,420
Twinkies!

456
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,480
See, it's a good thing we picked the Twinkies.

457
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,720
This vending machine wouldn't have beer or cigars in it.

458
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,980
Oh, I think he's about to break the vending machine.

459
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,760
Okay, I think I understand why it's broken, though.

460
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:15,500
does that work I think he's got to catch on fire right you
okay bud it's just I'm just mad yeah I'm a little mad too I

461
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:26,360
can't it's not fair it does it works and Visigal was the one
who and then Chase shouldn't have hmm

462
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,260
He's such a good boy.

463
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
You think he did the right thing?

464
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,950
I mean, I don't.

465
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,100
It seems very not clear.

466
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,900
Or unclear.

467
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,980
I don't know, man.

468
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,540
You know, Waterboy, I wish I had an answer for you.

469
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,080
I just...

470
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,660
In this case, I really don't know.

471
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,540
He is a hero.

472
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,260
He did his hero thing.

473
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,180
But...

474
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:21,040
case no point oh yeah feel better kind of I'll clean it up I
think more people were like you know he just took so many

475
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:30,620
things a lot of people were like you know really I guess
they really were like close to chase so it's it just is hard

476
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:41,120
that because she disobeyed orders main takeaways are that he
ended up getting hurt so we're a person down the shift and

477
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:55,140
that chase is in the infirmary and he's in pretty rough
shape despite his disposition it's like full of water just

478
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,620
don't tell him i told you that

479
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:12,480
helps when i'm feeling bad we're fortunate to have that
opportunity not the vague chase never took for granted so

480
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:23,900
let's get to work okay let's get to work oh my god it's
raining it's so sad wait who do i have that can upgrade oh

481
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:31,700
my gosh prism okay let's go um Let's go.

482
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,060
Let's go intellect.

483
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,980
She's gone.

484
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,740
Yeah, she's just gone.

485
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,200
Rare rain in LA.

486
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,600
I think the last time I went to LA, it was raining.

487
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,060
And it was, I remember, because it was flooding.

488
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,640
And Nimi would be like, are we going to be okay?

489
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,700
Are we going to be able to get through this street?

490
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,040
It's flooding.

491
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,920
Or we would see like a sign for a street that was closed.

492
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,800
And she's like, what if it flooded?

493
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,240
What if there was...

494
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,500
It's so funny.

495
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,880
Let's see.

496
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,480
I don't remember what I was doing for...

497
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,460
Malevolah is like all over the place.

498
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
I haven't really been focusing on her.

499
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,460
The music is so sad and everything.

500
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,020
Oh my goodness.

501
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,040
Mobility, maybe?

502
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,700
Yeah.

503
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,520
We'll just make her all around.

504
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,420
She's like a circle at this point.

505
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,960
It's my bad.

506
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,780
You said she was an all-rounder.

507
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,640
I did say that?

508
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,320
Okay, cool.

509
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,960
Well, I meant it.

510
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,960
Intellect.

511
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,660
He's the smartest guy ever.

512
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,100
Okay.

513
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,260
I think...

514
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,640
We haven't unlocked Flambé's second...

515
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,840
We haven't even gotten punch-ups first.

516
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,320
I haven't gotten Prism's second.

517
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,340
Or Malev...

518
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,600
No, we did get Malevula.

519
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,760
Yeah, because I remember...

520
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:18,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,520
And then Golem we have.

522
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,140
And Coupe.

523
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,360
We have.

524
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,020
Waterboy.

525
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,140
We have.

526
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:27,580
Okay.

527
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,580
Cool.

528
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,860
Went a hint?

529
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,580
Since it's...

530
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,940
maybe what I only probably get to dispatch like max four
more times maybe so

531
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,200
yeah you can give a hint how to get punch up since we're
like basically at the end game punch up needs to fail a call

532
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:07,720
to access it no stinking way I'm just too good at the game
punch up needs to get hurt I'm too good at the game oh my

533
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,160
I'm too good at the game.

534
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,940
That's why I haven't unlocked it.

535
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:20,980
SMAH.

536
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,280
We've been fucked on a beached whales off the coast.

537
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,620
Could really use some help getting them back in the ocean.

538
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,080
When a whale is beached, that's like it for them, no?

539
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,020
Hall a dozen 25-ton whales back into the...

540
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,920
Move them as fast as possible before the crowd gathers.

541
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,640
Oh, shoot.

542
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Okay, we do have mobility now with Coupe, so...

543
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,760
Yeah, they do explode.

544
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:55,800
Like, they kind of, like, the gases inside build up, and,
like, you have to, they, like...

545
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,220
It has to all release.

546
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,260
Yeah.

547
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,180
Music is so dramatic.

548
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,540
Second is mobility.

549
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,380
Well...

550
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,580
Can I, like... I wish I could, like...

551
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,060
Oh, wait!

552
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,780
Guys, oh, well, I guess he doesn't really, he doesn't like
expand the rush, you know what I mean?

553
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:22,970
Let's just do it.

554
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,270
Let's just do the two of them.

555
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,510
It's fine.

556
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,310
That's, that's a hundred percent.

557
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,150
We'll get it, most likely.

558
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,510
Eat a little, eat a little, eat a little.

559
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,630
Upchuk's rugby team lost, and he's throwing a very toxic
tantrum.

560
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,030
Send one and gamble?

561
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:47,590
Yeah.

562
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,190
Acid vomit villain Upchuk is using the rain to rain terror
on civilians.

563
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,670
Use necessary force.

564
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,290
We could send these too.

565
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,210
Fucking useless.

566
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,550
We useless!

567
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,210
That would you just send?

568
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,010
Well, if they lose, then that's even better too.

569
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,530
I should have sent him solo actually now that I think about
it.

570
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,630
Beach just means they're stuck dead or alive.

571
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,450
Oh, okay, okay.

572
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,690
I'm too good at the game.

573
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,070
Oh my god.

574
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:21,570
Ah!

575
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,150
Oh, hello?

576
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,930
Oh, I figured that's what it would do.

577
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:27,510
Okay.

578
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,790
We don't know yet.

579
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,710
So being skilled and beautiful.

580
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,270
I know.

581
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:44,790
Goodness.

582
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,370
Alright.

583
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,090
What is it?

584
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,830
Left, right, right, left.

585
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,310
Left, right, right, left.

586
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,650
Left, right, right, left.

587
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,690
Left, right, right.

588
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,610
Left, right, right, left.

589
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:00,890
Left, right, right, left.

590
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,790
Come here.

591
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,110
Come here.

592
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,420
How close you need to be.

593
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,060
Okay.

594
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,300
La la la la la la la la la la la.

595
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,920
It's not even like music.

596
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,160
It's like ambience.

597
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,020
It's so sad.

598
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,640
Runaway car.

599
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,560
Stop the runaway car before it crashes.

600
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:30,860
Yeah.

601
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,260
Uh-oh.

602
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,200
I think if I chose either of these, maybe the Endure.

603
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,940
Okay, hold on.

604
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,900
Because it's an 8.

605
00:47:51,580 --> 00:48:00,320
I know the last one would be a win, but if we're trying to
get punch-ups it could be like it could be enduring is like

606
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,200
a 10 you know what I mean and we're at 8 I

607
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,720
should have just sent him solo should have I we could try
another call yeah we'll win this one we'll win this one

608
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:25,160
because we have an easy win that's fine yeah I failed the
next one okay I'll send him for whatever we it.

609
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,000
Doesn't matter.

610
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,920
I'll let him rest up and then send him over.

611
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,530
I think it'll be okay.

612
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,040
Yeah.

613
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,080
Oh, homest.

614
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,640
One, um, skill point.

615
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,300
We're gonna put more vigor into you.

616
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,440
Flambé, we're gonna put more.

617
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,880
I think because I don't have... Wait, who else?

618
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:09,100
I don't... I only have coupé now for mobility, so we're
going to add more mobility to him.

619
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,520
One inch king.

620
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,280
If it could be zero, I'd do it.

621
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,220
He's dumb as rocks.

622
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,020
I mean, nah.

623
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,600
Wow.

624
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,720
Slow day, huh?

625
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,620
Oh, and nobody's talking either.

626
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,140
It's a little unnerving.

627
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:31,880
Hello?

628
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,740
Are you okay?

629
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,120
Oh, Golem's shit face.

630
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,020
I think he's about to piss mud on the high school.

631
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:38,520
Oh, no.

632
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,020
Yeah, you know, I saw him pulling over a beer truck earlier.

633
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,560
I did think that was weird.

634
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,220
Come on, buddy.

635
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,220
Spit it out.

636
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,480
I'm not vomiting this shift.

637
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,040
You are...

638
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,300
Golem, I get it.

639
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,580
I want to get shit face right now more than anything, but
we've got a job to do.

640
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,780
And I need all of you to do it.

641
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,280
just hang in there until the end of the shift after that you
can do whatever the fuck you want

642
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:12,780
cool can someone please go get golem before he does more
property damage oh oh little guy big guy actually save golem

643
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:25,080
from himself and carry him back to stn it's all you buddy if
there's no one else it's all you let's send our smallest guy

644
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,600
to get our biggest guy.

645
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,540
Wait, where'd my mouse go?

646
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,660
Oh, there's...

647
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,120
Okay, so we've got a super down here who controls bugs.

648
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,080
Apparently they have beef with one of our farmers using
pesticides.

649
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,660
Watch him clear it.

650
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,820
That'd be crazy.

651
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,780
Take down the bug-controlling assailant.

652
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,440
Save the farmer being attacked by the bees.

653
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,940
I feel like Flambe can handle this.

654
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,840
Honestly, we can't really...

655
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,880
Well, I guess we could send Waterboy to The bees!

656
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,580
I think he's got this.

657
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,640
Wait, the fucking rain.

658
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,680
Flang's a bitch, you can't see shit.

659
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,760
The streets turned into a goddamn slip and slide.

660
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,160
I fucking love slip and slide, bro.

661
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,880
I haven't seen it come down this bad and wild.

662
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,700
Oh, I can't wait.

663
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:12,620
If he...

664
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:12,620
I like it.

665
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,780
It feels right for today.

666
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,880
Fucking cool it, emo boy.

667
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,580
I'm the best Hulk I could muster.

668
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
I'm too good at the game!

669
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,340
Sonny's...

670
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,900
7%!

671
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,360
No!

672
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Oh my god.

673
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:40,960
Oh!

674
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,520
Streamer luck, I guess so.

675
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,820
Oh, shoot.

676
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,640
I'm gonna give him some more charisma too.

677
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,020
Wait.

678
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,660
Yeah, yeah, we only have, like, prism and well, actually,

679
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,720
We have Waterboy Coupe.

680

We have a lot on Int.

681
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,840
Let's do more vigor, then.

682
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,580
Keep going.

683
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,260
Keep going.

684
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,340
Your luck is literally against all odds.

685
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,840
Yes, yes.

686
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,900
Hey, the Bone Zone pissed off the wrong gang, and they're
holding him hostage.

687
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,800
Listen, I know he sucks, but he writes my checks.

688
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,480

Break through the barricades.

708
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,130
Red rings coordinating strikes across torrents.

709
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,670
Looks like they're hitting the port next.

710
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,050
Recon only.

711
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,750
Find out what they're up to.

712
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:52,630
Don't be seen.

713
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,390
So you gotta be, uh, you could be fat.

714
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:55,910
Oh, wait.

715
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,370
If I did the two of them, it would be too much.

716
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:00,990
Hold on.

717
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:01,950
What's, uh, go all out?

718
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,490
Now's our chance to get payback.

719
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,250
Or chase.

720
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,490
Bring the fight.

721
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,430
Make them pay.

722
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,350
Fire and water.

723
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:11,770
I know.

724
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:24,110

728
00:55:51,570 --> 00:56:04,030
okay yay he failed wait nothing happened this fucking rain

729
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:10,350
he does need to get injured instead of rather just failing i
saw me some people say that he just needs to fail and that

730
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,270
some people say he needs to get injured Okay.

731
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,210
Dang.

732
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:15,630
Oh, well.

733
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,190
Investigate what could be causing flooding.

734
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,490
Oh, everybody is like...

735
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,710
We have nobody.

736
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,370
We have Prism.

737
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,290
Prism can go all on our lonesome.

738
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,670
Move quickly?

739
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,490
Oh.

740
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:30,690
Wait a second.

741
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,670
Hero training helps me keep my mind off of things.

742
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,750
I really think it can help the team too.

743
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,350
Oh, shoot.

744
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,070
Oh, shoot.

745
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:39,430
Oh, shoot.

746
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:39,710
Okay.

747
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,550
Let's pull somebody out.

748
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:44,710
of resting, we'll pull out Clupé.

749
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:46,710
Okay.

750
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:47,850
Back to it.

751
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,200
There we go.

752
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,240
Beep, beep, beep.

753
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,060
Oh, wait.

754
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,540
I need to do a training then.

755
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,120
We could do Flambé.

756
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,100
Oh, that was close.

757
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,200
Prism Second is really good.

758
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,180
What was Prism Second?

759
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,040
I don't even remember.

760
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,180
Wait, hold on.

761
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,030
Uh, powers.

762
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,070
Oh, I don't have it yet.

763
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,670
That's why.

764
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,850
I don't have it yet.

765
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:25,530
Oh, the duplicate.

766
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,010
Yeah, I was like, wait.

767
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,510
I don't even have it yet.

768
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,630
There's a mass pile up in the Tanger caught fire.

769
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,790
Rescue the trapped civilians and cars.

770
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,570
The fire's growing despite the rain.

771
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,670
Put it out quick.

772
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,990
I think this is a golem solo.

773
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:46,930
Maybe not.

774
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,250
He thought he'd be quicker.

775
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,690
Let's do Disrupted.

776
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:58,790
Punch up this time.

777
00:57:58,970 --> 00:57:59,930
You guys are probably right.

778
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,790
Examine the store.

779
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,050
We can do...

780
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,050
Yeah, we can do this one.

781
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,710
He's too slow.

782
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,250
He's too slow.

783
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:13,610
Noise.

784
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,470
Flood under control.

785
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,150
Okay, I have so many stats.

786
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:27,330
need to like start giving to people oh my gosh water boy
you're getting some more vigor and wait i didn't i didn't

787
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:38,710
confirm there we go coupe you're gonna get oh no no no no no
more smarts more intellect train prism that's what i want to

788
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:49,110
do yeah and then flambé i thought maybe flambé too i don't
have his second power either Maybe Flambe.

789
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,600
Waterboy's stats look like Batman's symbol.

790
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,540
It does.

791
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,900
That's how you call him.

792
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,480
Our all-rounder, you're going to get more vigor.

793
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,260
Actually, more mobility.

794
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,380
I guess it's fine.

795
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,080
And Flambe.

796
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,760
I am the water.

797
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,740
I am the one who knocks.

798
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,060
I am the danger.

799
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,540
I am the one who drinks water.

800
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,560
It doesn't really work.

801
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,660
It doesn't work.

802
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:38,840
Never mind.

803
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:39,700
Ignore.

804
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,200
Ignore.

805
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,220
It's awkward now.

806
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,060
You tried.

807
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:44,520
I did.

808
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:45,960
Mobility.

809
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,200
I feel like we need a little bit more mobility in here.

810
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,960
It's our rooms, but yeah?

811
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,340
Yeah, confirmed it this morning.

812
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,060
We're all good.

813
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,220
Okay.

814
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:53,840
And we don't have enough.

815
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,660
We do have...

816
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,120
Okay, here we go.

817
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:55,560
Confirmed.

818
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,360
Let's just do his.

819
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,500
I don't want to lose it.

820
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,180
Good evening, Minto and Wisps.

821
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:03,780
Sps.

822
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,440
Sps.

823
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:05,580
Sps.

824
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,440
Sps.

825
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,500
Are you happy to be here?

826
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,240
Hello!

827
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,500
Alright, let's see what we got.

828
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,100
Comet.

829
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,340
After a success, Flambé also reduces call completion and
travel time.

830
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:41,460
Yo, my name is Minto, and I have a hint of where the secret
treasure is, but you'll never guess where it is, because I

831
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,700
hid it real good.

832
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,420
And how

833
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,980
I can think of his food, but it doesn't, because it has to,
but it doesn't rhyme.

834
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:16,060
I hit it real good, but you'd have to knock on wood to find
where it's at, because I only told my cat.

835
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,080
You'll never find it.

836
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,240
My treasure.

837
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,020
You'll never find it.

838
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,980
A treasure is hidden in my pillow.

839
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,660
Did you guys ever, like, hide stuff under your pillow when
you were, like, trying to hide it before?

840
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,880
You weren't supposed to say...

841
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,340
Oops.

842
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:54,840
My bad.

843
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,340
Comment, after a success, Flambé also reduces call
completion and travel.

844
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:12,100
time after two successes flambe fails a third wait what oh
if after two successes he fails a third he is downed oh my

845
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:21,960
gosh ben drowned succeeding twice will set flambe's combat
and mobility to max and removes rest time after a fail

846
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,580
flambe's stats drop to one oh i should not have trained this
guy

847
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,220
You've met with a terrible fit, haven't you?

848
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,560
Oh my god!

849
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,860
Just don't fail, for real.

850
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:50,710
You'll have to hide it under another pillow.

851
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,210
I think I'll do comet because...

852
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,940
It's only after one success.

853
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,440
This one, it has to be two successes.

854
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,600
But it removes rest time.

855
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,480
After a fail, his stats drop to one.

856
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,360
That's so risky.

857
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,900
DeviCard, thank you so much for that gifted.

858
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,680
Or maybe Supernova is better.

859
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,420
Because then at least he's still in.

860
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,100
His combat and mobility are already maxed out.

861
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:27,560
No.

862
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,320
Oh, wait.

863
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,620
I didn't think so.

864
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,140
No.

865
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,180
It just gives the impression that it is.

866
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,100
But they're far from.

867
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,800
I don't know why it's showing up like that.

868
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,560
That's confusing.

869
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:51,940
Call...

870
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,420
Wait.

871
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,480
This one removes rest time.

872
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,480
That's kind of huge.

873
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,550
I think I'll go with supernova.

874
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:07,050
Wah!

875
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,920
He already flies.

876
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,340
That has nothing to do with rest time.

877
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:38,540
Oh No, we were so close Oh, no, go home Lucy Oh, well, okay
Good shift all things considered See you tomorrow Hopefully

878
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,480
with some good news Wait, we only I thought it was
lunchtime.

879
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,280
We only did one I know we were so stinking close Imagine

880
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:11,230
It's so sad Babe Oh he's in his chair No Who's in there?

881
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:11,550
Oh

882
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:18,370
The girls are fighting What's happening now?

883
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,420
Damn You weren't part of the uh what are y'all looking at

884
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:37,740
she's just got a little yeah oh um cheers lad good looking
out who is paying for this okay who's gonna pay for this

885
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:48,300
i'll pay i'm the one that caused the damage yeah i'll pay
i'm the one that kicked you oh okay cool now that we've got

886
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:52,180
all of the details clear why that's just a difference

887
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:01,520
face he had every right to punt me through the wall right
it's a door and I doubt you were actually in his face more

888
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:13,240
like ankle easier to kick what the fuck is going on we want
her out we voted it was nearly unanimous she shouldn't have

889
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:20,700
done what she did I think she should go sir I thought they
would want her to stay Oh, dang.

890
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,420
Who wants her to stay?

891
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,100
Just me.

892
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,500
Oh, Gollum!

893
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,660
But the team is more important than any one of us, so.

894
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,040
Oh, Gollum.

895
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,120
I won't stand in the way.

896
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,640
You could have led with that.

897
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,700
We heard about the suspension bullshit.

898
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,680
It ain't enough, Robert.

899
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,320
Not for what she did.

900
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,000
To put everything we've been building at risk, and for what?

901
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,520
I like the bitch, but she gotta go.

902
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,980
And by go, we mean cut, just like you cut Sonar.

903
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,500
No one here wants to say it's also her.

904
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,780
But that's what it is.

905
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,760
Look, I probably don't say this enough.

906
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,580
I want them to lie, you know what, I get it.

907
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,600
But I'm proud of all of you.

908
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,480
How far you've come.

909
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,980
A few months ago, you wouldn't have been in a room like this
discussing the needs of the Z team.

910
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,700
And if you did, there would be a lot more than one broken
door.

911
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,630
So, I'm not putting all of that at risk for one person who
can't keep up.

912
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:37,850
I've done my best to salvage things and work with her, but
as you know, this isn't the first time a Visigal has put us

913
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:38,350
at risk.

914
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,870
It's not that I didn't like her.

915
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,370
It's just business, baby.

916
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,750
It'll be the last.

917
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,650
I'll let Blazer know of your decision.

918
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,370
And I'll let her know.

919
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,010
I support it.

920
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,630
Oh, Gollum, I'm so sorry.

921
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:05,330
Aww.

922
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,420
She was here.

923
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:12,960
Aww.

924
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,720
She's holding her breath this entire time.

925
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:20,600
Busy?

926
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,900
Sorry, I can come back.

927
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:26,420
Why?

928
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,760
First time we met you were in your underwear.

929
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:37,420
fitting right last time you see me that I'd be in mine I
heard everything you don't have to double fire me okay I'm

930
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:49,260
going you gave me no choice well you gave me no choice you
fired yourself when you went after the pulse I tried my best

931
01:08:49,260 --> 01:09:05,380
really and I think I tried the most with you but it wasn't
enough I wasn't enough which is why this this is on me okay

932
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:14,080
sounds like a breakup i guess if you like go pursue her it
doesn't way more of a breakup they're right i don't deserve

933
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:23,580
anyone's forgiveness anyone's health anyone's love because i
can never repay it nothing i do will ever make up for what

934
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:30,180
i've already done to you i'd hope getting the astral pulse
back would help i don't think the I couldn't even do that.

935
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,900
You're being a little dramatic.

936
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,160
You don't owe anyone anything, okay?

937
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,360
Least of all me.

938
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,340
I was there that night.

939
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,100
What are you saying?

940
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,300
Oh.

941
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,880
I never ran with Cruz.

942
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,920
Always did my own thing, but my ass...

943
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,420
I was gonna say he's shocked by our booba.

944
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,000
They had an augment that could increase my lung capacity.

945
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,060
Only catches I'd have to work for them, paying down for
years.

946
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,420
Oh, she was there!

947
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:09,500
Oh!

948
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,870
The black bars.

949
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:20,830
They're so funny.

950
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,480
Then one day Shroud came to me and said, I could have the
whole time cleared if I was able to do one thing.

951
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,180
Place a bomb on the back of my command undetected.

952
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,520
Put the bomb!

953
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:43,980
But

954
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,020
how do you not get...

955
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,140
Good news, buddy.

956
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,360
I mean, am I so...

957
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,900
I mean, that's...

958
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,740
I could be mad at her, but like...

959
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,700
The villain does a villain thing.

960
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,720
She changed, oh, she decided that she wanted to be good
after.

961
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,780
I mean, it's so bad, but...

962
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:39,980
I quit the moment I placed it i walked out before it even
blew she oh so she just wanted her debt cleared and then she

963
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:50,700
left my augments conveniently stopped working so i signed up
for the phoenix program the next day which gave me the

964
01:11:50,700 --> 01:12:02,040
chance to fuck your life up twice well what i like i said i
well i forgive you so there we fucking chill out now You

965
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,860
can't fucking forgive me?

966
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,340
You haven't even, like, processed what's going on.

967
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,360
You did villain shit while you were...

968
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,620
That's exactly what I just said!

969
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,860
That's the same things that you directed at me?

970
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,160
No.

971
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,500
That's what I just said.

972
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,320
That's in the past.

973
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,380
You're not the same person that was there that night,
neither am I.

974
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,480
That's sweet.

975
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,580
Maybe I'm Robert.

976
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,940
All I wanted from this was for people to look at me the same
way to eat.

977
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,060
You look at Blazer.

978
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,480
Even if it was just once, you know?

979
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,680
Instead, they've always seen me how you see me right now.

980
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,720
And what was that?

981
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,740
Like I'm incapable of good.

982
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,110
I think in this situation, it's not that she's...

983
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,730
We're not cutting her because she's incapable of being good.

984
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,230
She has to understand that she's being cut because...

985
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:56,710
She...

986
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,390
She made this stupid decision.

987
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,270
Like, I think anybody would get fired from a job for that.

988
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,330
My Oshiminto Robertson III.

989
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:16,630
She's just a loose can And yeah, like she knew She has to
learn to be like A little more, you know Yeah, impulsive is

990
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,890
a good way to put it Yeah, yeah, yeah

991
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:35,140
She tried to help you though Yeah, but like Some people try
to help and it ends up Making things worse Uh oh

992
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:52,690
Oh Team water boy So true.

993
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:54,030
I feel like...

994
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:59,090
Sorry, never mind.

995
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,010
I don't know.

996
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:03,270
Oh!

997
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:03,830
Oh!

998
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,990
I didn't even notice that there was a thing down there.

999
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:06,630
Oh my gosh.

1000
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,730
I didn't even notice that there was a decision.

1001
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,190
Oops.

1002
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,530
But I don't think it's our... it's up to us to reveal his
identity.

1003
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:21,150
I would have picked Invisigirl anyway, because I don't think
it's up to us to reveal that.

1004
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:21,790
That's him.

1005
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,470
Sorry.

1006
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,550
I was like reading her text and how she writes.

1007
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,950
Yeah, I'm feeling like...

1008
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,950
I hope they all die.

1009
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,910
I'm serious.

1010
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,070
Beard guy.

1011
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:47,250
Any dumbass walking into a trap that fucking stupid should
have to plug pulls right now.

1012
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,250
Just pillows over faces.

1013
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,730
Oh man, have you seen what the poison does to their faces?

1014
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,530
They get all red and puffy.

1015
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:55,750
Ooh.

1016
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:56,430
Ooh!

1017
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:57,750
God damn.

1018
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,510
All right.

1019
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,610
I'm just a fucking bitch.

1020
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,170
I'm sorry.

1021
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,190
It's my fault.

1022
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:04,510
Um, I've been distracted.

1023
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:05,890
Give me another drink.

1024
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:07,310
Give me another drink.

1025
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,150
They smashed mine.

1026
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,870
Sure.

1027
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,490
Malevolent best girl.

1028
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,590
You seem turd.

1029
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,480
Oh, fuck.

1030
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,300
I know what's going on.

1031
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,360
You'd probably lost someone there.

1032
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,640
That's why he's been staring at that shit all night.

1033
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:27,620
Who are?

1034
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,680
Who is this guy?

1035
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:39,780
oh my god this one's on me beard guy his beard guy

1036
01:15:44,380 --> 01:16:01,980
thank you we're doing shots together even oh that was the
cleanest pour I've ever seen ever free beer oh my uh oh

1037
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,860
don't say anything about my girl.

1038
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,120
I will have to defend her honor.

1039
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,880
Invisibich.

1040
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,940
Fucking traitor.

1041
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,920
I won't be bad anymore.

1042
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,840
Cheers, fellas.

1043
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,240
To the fucking dream.

1044
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,740
To five minutes with the tightest ass in all of L.A.

1045
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:26,100
County.

1046
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,520
Don't say that who that- Motorboat an ass?

1047
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,040
Probably not, right?

1048
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,280
You probably could, right?

1049
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,320
The one who had that upper butthole.

1050
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,380
What's up?

1051
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,720
You don't like asses.

1052
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,240
Glash him!

1053
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:47,640
Oh!

1054
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,940
I thought I was gonna pour it on him.

1055
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,140
Now as far as that was gonna take you.

1056
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,880
Good on you, Kate.

1057
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,240
You replaced that dream.

1058
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,400
That's what glassing means.

1059
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,180
I learned.

1060
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,260
I respect her.

1061
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:15,440
Blazer.

1062
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,340
Real fucking superhero.

1063
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:18,980
Uh-oh.

1064
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,380
He got the juice.

1065
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,600
The red juice.

1066
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,540
Everybody's got the juice.

1067
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,820
Tune to blow some fucker's brains out.

1068
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,680
Non-slip mats are a must.

1069
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:32,860
Uh-oh.

1070
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,120
Need some for the hideout.

1071
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,660
Feel silly calling it a hideout.

1072
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,240
Is beard guy shroud?

1073
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,400
Can you take care of him for me?

1074
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,320
Obviously, you two don't need an introduction.

1075
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,920
I've been waiting for this.

1076
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:50,780
No way!

1077
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,350
So dark!

1078
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:00,600
Chase.

1079
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,040
Your little team.

1080
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:03,640
Your little team.

1081
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,040
You're a little team of turning coats.

1082
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,380
You think you can beat the bad by being good.

1083
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,240
Oh.

1084
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,400
But there's no solving human nature.

1085
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,800
This is MGS3 torture sin happening.

1086
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,080
Stop evil.

1087
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,020
Whoa.

1088
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,620
All you can do is control.

1089
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:43,200
it wait is it actually is this was your father's gun kept it
in his locker fully loaded six shots i couldn't have

1090
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:49,940
predicted i'd use it to kill him the first bullet raised his
shoulder and adjusted Spike.

1091
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:51,920
Sick shot.

1092
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:53,320
I'm sorry.

1093
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:54,520
I'm listening.

1094
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:54,880
I'm listening.

1095
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:55,220
I'm listening.

1096
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,280
I was lying on the floor, eyes full of fear, when I put the
fourth through his face.

1097
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:00,300
Oh my god.

1098
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:05,280
A bit of a waste to put the fifth or that idiot's skull, but
I wanted to make sure it worked after all these years.

1099
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:07,560
Sorry.

1100
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,920
Your father was the last person to touch this blood.

1101
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,640
And now, there's a 16 and a half percent chance that touches
you next.

1102
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:22,520
Your invisible girlfriend Hey, hey, hey, I have another
girlfriend.

1103
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,820
Where the fuck is it?

1104
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,120
Oh, she...

1105
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:28,760
Mega Man.

1106
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,480
Heroes are the past.

1107
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,480
Spit!

1108
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:36,160
With the pulse, I'll control this city and restore balance.

1109
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,100
Oh, bro.

1110
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,840
This is why I hate luck.

1111
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:46,940
Runs out.

1112
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:47,920
Never punished!

1113
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:48,380
It's fine.

1114
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:54,300
Had it, why did I let you string me up like a fucking
pinata?

1115
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,180
She didn't get the pulse.

1116
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,920
She did, but...

1117
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,340
Didn't she get taken from her?

1118
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,240
You actually believe that.

1119
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,440
Show him.

1120
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,940
He really sounds like Jesse here.

1121
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,960
Invisibitch has the pulse.

1122
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
She had it, but I thought it was taken from her.

1123
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,620
What I don't know is why she didn't give it.

1124
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,260
it to you.

1125
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,060
She played you too.

1126
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,800
You're I am thinking she's working with you, but she's
fucking us both.

1127
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,340
She doesn't want us to be Mecha Man?

1128
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,080
She didn't take it for you.

1129
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,560
Mecha Man, Mecha Man!

1130
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,120
Mecha Man!

1131
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,500
It's okay.

1132
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,200
She fooled me too.

1133
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,240
This is a little...

1134
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:05,410
Oh my god, she's so awesome.

1135
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:10,650
A blonde laser.

1136
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:14,450
I hired the bartender, but I can still get you something to
drink.

1137
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:16,250
No, thank you.

1138
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,310
Oh, the way she walked in.

1139
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:20,390
What do I owe the pleasure?

1140
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,250
I'm here for him.

1141
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:27,090
Fired, I know.

1142
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:33,050
In five minutes, this bar will be surrounded by SDN agents,
heroes, and whoever else you in your ring have pissed off

1143
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,830
recently, which happens to be every gang in Los Angeles.

1144
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:38,910
Now, if you...

1145
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:41,130
Oh, shit.

1146
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:46,710
Do not disrespect one of the last true heroes.

1147
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:47,650
Oh, yeah!

1148
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,250
Oh, my God.

1149
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,510
Wait, I kind of love Shroud.

1150
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:52,710
Sorry about that.

1151
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,230
If they weren't shit, you wouldn't have cut them.

1152
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,410
You were saying...

1153
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:01,610
I can see I'm outnumbered.

1154
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,710
That eventually I would fall.

1155
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,730
But by my read...

1156
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,450
I'm taking a lot of you with me.

1157
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:15,650
She's so cool!

1158
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:16,690
So all of you can leave now.

1159
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,990
I think we picked right, guys.

1160
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,670
Or half of you can die here.

1161
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,030
No, that's a fucking superhero.

1162
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,630
Chills.

1163
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,290
Top notch.

1164
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,150
You made them nervous.

1165
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,050
Okay, we're out of here.

1166
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,650
Take your piss-soaked pants out the back, please.

1167
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,730
Don't want to tempt this tiger.

1168
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,670
Now's not our time, Blazer.

1169
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,370
But it's coming sooner than you think.

1170
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:01,570
And by my calculations, it was closer to 32%.

1171
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,610
But half sounds better.

1172
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:11,590
I think I'm obsessed with him.

1173
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:13,070
Oh, my God!

1174
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:14,690
Urm, actually.

1175
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,770
I can't believe you found me.

1176
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:20,750
How do you find me?

1177
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,130
Yeah.

1178
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:23,190
I tracked your phone.

1179
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,290
Sorry.

1180
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:25,870
She's obsessed with me, too.

1181
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:26,690
I'll never forgive you.

1182
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:30,990
She's obsessed with me.

1183
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,370
Oh, it's Matt Mercer.

1184
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,250
Oh, my God.

1185
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,150
He kills it.

1186
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,430
Don't worry.

1187
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,210
I've got you.

1188
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,010
Oh, my God.

1189
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:42,110
It's the Princess Carrie that I always wanted.

1190
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,310
Yippee!

1191
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,350
He really tenderized you.

1192
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,250
Yeah, I could use someone to kiss my boo-boos.

1193
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:51,570
Yeah.

1194
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,010
I saw the footage.

1195
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:56,150
What if it was doctored?

1196
01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:04,730
why wouldn't she tell you if she has it I don't understand
what she would want it for unless she's planning something

1197
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:15,610
but I don't know if it's good or bad is it the mask she's
planning something shut up just don't know what stop stop

1198
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:29,130

He could finally get injured if he gets blown up, right?

1309
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,960
Which one would hurt him?

1310
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:59,950
I need my blood oozing out his nose.

1311
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:02,230
He won't fail.

1312
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:04,050
Punch the bomb.

1313
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:04,870

1320
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:14,450

1321
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:15,830

Or what's left of it.

1325
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,570
We need to stop the Red Ring before they wipe us off the
map.

1326
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:32,950
Alright, everyone.

1327
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:35,050
You should get live updates on the state of the city.

1328
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,190
Let's kick some Red Ring ass.

1329
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,710
Oh!

1330
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:39,270
That doesn't seem so good.

1331
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:41,370
Wait, so does it need to go stay up?

1332
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:42,690
That's like a lifeline?

1333
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:46,550
Nice.

1334
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:50,710
Oh, achieved the perfect dispatch with only one hero.

1335
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,150
I got an achievement for that.

1336
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:53,690
Very cool.

1337
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,950

Okay, so it's HP.

1339
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:59,450
Okay, so it does need to stay up.

1340
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:04,270
Uh, I'm gonna go for intellect again.

1341
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,860
And they're resting.

1342
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,780
That should be able to be good.

1343
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,280
Oh, this is surprisingly high.

1344
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,160

01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,740
Yes, oh.

1371
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,740
Okay, we're fine.

1372
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,500
Everything's, everything's fine.

1373
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,700
Everything's fine.

1374
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,580
Don't worry about it.

1375
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:36,400
Oh, it's this thing again.

1376
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:37,020
Warmer.

1377
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:37,960
Warmer.

1378
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:45,880
There we go.

1379
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,180
Oh.

1380
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:56,810
There we go.

1381
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:00,650
Scary.

1382
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:02,550
That was close.

1383
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:03,350
It was flambé.

1384
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:03,890
Yay!

1385
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:05,410
We got flambé.

1386
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:09,890
What are you doing?

1387
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:10,950
Wait, what is he doing?

1388
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,470
Holy cow.

1389
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:18,450
Holy cow.

1390
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,790
Don't.

1391
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:29,500
Be careful.

1392
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,660
We don't know what's going on in the refinery.

1393
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:41,300

1397
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,040
We're putting in some mad OT.

1398
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:09,140
I could have really used you like two seconds ago.

1399
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:09,800
Oh, geez.

1400
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:12,720
Okay.

1401
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,200
Oh, I have, let's see, Prism.

1402
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:20,970
I don't really have it.

1403
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,490
I don't want to just, like, use...

1404
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:27,110
I'm putting it in intellect.

1405
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:29,190
Smarter.

1406
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:31,750
It's okay.

1407
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,550
I think it'll be all right.

1408
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:34,570
Let's see what's going on here.

1409
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,050
Flambé, okay.

1410
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:38,630
Oh, that's not good.

1411
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:42,090
Oh, oh, it was so close.

1412
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:44,030
I think I'm going to use my head.

1413
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:45,410
Ah!

1414
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:46,550
Ah!

1415
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:47,570
We got it!

1416
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:48,850
We got it!

1417
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:50,930
Punch-up doesn't receive any debuffs or injuries.

1418
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,050
He cannot be downed.

1419
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:54,470
Oh, wait, no, we didn't!

1420
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,880
We didn't!

1421
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,250
Okay.

1422
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,330
Requesting backup.

1423
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,550
We've got several 487s at the mall.

1424
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:03,230
Civilians, not Red Ring.

1425
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,610
I want...

1426
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:05,870
Is this going down fast?

1427
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,930
Uh, fast enough.

1428
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:10,210
Or I don't think I'll be able...

1429
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:11,150
I can at least heal...

1430
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:12,110
Oh, I got these dickheads.

1431
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:13,550
I can heal him.

1432
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:15,550
At least.

1433
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,310
Guess what?

1434
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:19,110
Swiftly.

1435
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:19,470
Wait.

1436
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:21,650
Make up your mind.

1437
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:23,010
There we go.

1438
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:25,910
We can at least heal him.

1439
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:27,310
Pain and gain.

1440
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,810
There we go.

1441
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,130
That's a hell of a deal.

1442
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:31,470
Oh, what's happening?

1443
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:32,490
Oh, water boy!

1444
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:33,370
Shit.

1445
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:34,590
Signal split.

1446
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:36,490
Can't look for them at the same time.

1447
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:37,870
Gotta pick one to track first.

1448
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,510
Water boy.

1449
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,610
Where's Waterboy?

1450
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:40,370
Waterboy?

1451
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:42,490
Where's... Waterboy.

1452
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,050
Waterboy's come a long way, but he can't handle this alone.

1453
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:46,330
Come on, Waterboy.

1454
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:46,870
Let's go.

1455
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:47,590
We're hacking.

1456
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,950
Okay.

1457
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,130
I'm scared.

1458
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:53,370
Hang tight, Waterboy.

1459
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:54,070
I'm scared.

1460
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:55,070
Oh, okay.

1461
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:58,670
Oh, whoa.

1462
01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:59,330
Let me...

1463
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:00,470
Oh, gosh.

1464
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:01,710
As soon as I move.

1465
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,190
Okay.

1466
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:04,090
Uh...

1467
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:04,930
Oh, gosh.

1468
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:05,930
This is scary.

1469
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:08,230
He's gonna be up there.

1470
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:09,610
No, probably.

1471
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:14,570
Stay with me.

1472
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:15,750
Recalibrating it.

1473
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:18,270
Ah!

1474
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,780
Oh, jeez!

1475
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,740
Oh, scared me!

1476
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,000
Ah!

1477
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:28,420
Is it not in there?

1478
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:30,420
Or...

1479
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,000
Oh, my God.

1480
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:31,440
Wait.

1481
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:32,880
Out of range.

1482
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,580
There's not another thing for me to unlock, though.

1483
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,480
Oh, gosh.

1484
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:40,480
Where is it coming from?

1485
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:40,780
Okay.

1486
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:53,860

1488
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,980
I was like, wait a second.

1489
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,040
Only stressing a little bit.

1490
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,320
I am getting stressed out.

1491
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,440
I'm stressed out too.

1492
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:20,200
I'm stressed.

1493
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:21,580
I'm stressed.

1494
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,520
Yay.

1495
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,420
And that's how we do it down under.

1496
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:28,720
Yay.

1497
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,180
Let's get you.

1498
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:34,660
Oh my gosh.

1499
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:35,900
She's actually...

1500
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,660
Look at that.

1501
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,640
Complete symmetry.

1502
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,420
Waterboy, what's happening?

1503
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:45,400
Did they put Waterboy on a train?

1504
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:45,980
What?

1505
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,640
He's on a train being sent out of town.

1506
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,420
Gotta get there fast.

1507
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:56,240
Okay, hold on.

1508
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:56,740
What's this one?

1509
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:57,480
There's a bomb downtown.

1510
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,020
We need someone to defuse it immediately.

1511
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,600
Defuse the bomb.

1512
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,520
We gotta use Prism.

1513
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,280
You ain't ready for this.

1514
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:07,800
She's smart enough to do it alone.

1515
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:16,730
both.

1516
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:21,810
I feel me.

1517
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:22,990
You weren't injured.

1518
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,530
We have time.

1519
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:26,170
We have time.

1520
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:28,710
Maybe we can send Malevila to heal him too.

1521
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,370
I'm going to send him with Malevila so they'll heal.

1522
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,430
We just have to...

1523
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,890
We need all hands on deck and our trainees are pissed at us.

1524
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,050
Oh, I do have a heal item!

1525
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:38,770
Oh my gosh.

1526
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:41,010
I haven't... I even forgot about them.

1527
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:48,190
But I could use it on someone else that, like, I think it's
okay send my level up with flambe and then i could heal

1528
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:55,690
punch up i think that would make more sense

1529
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:08,560
what is this one join sweet talker and reassuring the
trainees that no one should die oh you probably need to go

1530
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:14,360
to this because you're our best talker right now but it's
you're not like our greatest talker hold on wait maybe we

1531
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,580
could actually we'll send golem once he's done

1532
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:26,010
that was scary that was scary Okay, all right.

1533
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:27,130
Sen Golem?

1534
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,770
New me?

1535
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:30,490
Fucking rocks.

1536
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:31,870
Yeah?

1537
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,370
Don't heal Punch-Up.

1538
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:38,810
Oh yeah, Punch-Up can't be down.

1539
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:39,210
You're right.

1540
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:40,710
That was his skill that just unlocked.

1541
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:45,010
Team first.

1542
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:54,340
Does it matter if he's...

1543
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:54,920
Guess what?

1544
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,520
Oh yeah, yeah.

1545
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,540
Well, yeah.

1546
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,360
Okay, there we go.

1547
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,200
All right.

1548
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:00,780
Send.

1549
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,160
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1550
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,040
Blah, blah.

1551
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,920
There we go.

1552
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:08,440
Okay.

1553
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:10,680
We're good.

1554
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:11,660
Everything's fine.

1555
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,160
What happened?

1556
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:17,300
Uh-oh.

1557
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,980
Look, how is Coupe required?

1558
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,720
She's not even here.

1559
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,450
I don't even have her here.

1560
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:30,790
Oh yeah.

1561
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:31,510
Easy.

1562
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,050
Easy peasy.

1563
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:34,690
Everybody's inspired.

1564
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:35,610
It's good.

1565
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:37,790
Alright, we're fine.

1566
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:38,510
Everything's good.

1567
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,790
Oh yeah, I could have gotten her back instead of water boy.

1568
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:47,630
But we could get her back after this.

1569
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,150
No, like, come on.

1570
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:52,890
There she is.

1571
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,290
I need backup now.

1572
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:57,910
She's drowning?

1573
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,460
Pull her up?

1574
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,080
What?

1575
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:05,840
What?

1576
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,200
How?

1577
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,380
How did that happen?

1578
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,900
I need to send Waterboy.

1579
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,100
Hold on.

1580
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,500
We're gonna send Waterboy.

1581
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,920
He's gonna be the best bet ever.

1582
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,220
She's got time.

1583
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,360
You're only drowning.

1584
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,600
Okay, she doesn't have time.

1585
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:29,160
I'm scared.

1586
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:33,640
You got this punch up.

1587
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,400
Maybe Flambé actually would do it.

1588
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,000
I need it.

1589
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,640
Back up now.

1590
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:41,740
What the fuck did they take her there?

1591
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:49,820
coffee in case I need it for like an emergency if a lot of
things start, you know, like popping up all at once.

1592
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,780
I think this is enough, right?

1593
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,960
Or does it need more vigor?

1594
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:00,980
Oh, I think this is fine.

1595
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,360
You can use coffee multiple times in these shifts.

1596
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,760
You can?

1597
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,060
Since I only have one, though.

1598
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,400
Okay, I'll just use it on Water Boy.

1599
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,220
It'd be so good.

1600
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:15,720
Ready for to go do more work.

1601
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,860
Go do it.

1602
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,940
Look, it's my favorite team in fire and water.

1603
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,760
Fire and water.

1604
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,560
There he goes.

1605
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:28,680
A little slow.

1606
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,460
It's actually quite slow.

1607
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:45,130
Ring will soon be the dead ring.

1608
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:46,670
All right, King's all here.

1609
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,090
Some of you in worse shape than others.

1610
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,570
He didn't even get there.

1611
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:57,820
Shit.

1612
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,740
He doesn't look that bad.

1613
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,320
I'm sober yet.

1614
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,540
Oh, uh-oh, here we go.

1615
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,400
Alright, everybody.

1616
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:03,880
Oh.

1617
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,080
Oh.

1618
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:07,020
Oh.

1619
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,200
Oh, Phamama-Man.

1620
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:10,500
Give me one second.

1621
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:11,480
Is he gonna...

1622
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:11,880
Phamama-Man?

1623
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,100
Uh, fuck.

1624
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:13,780
What's your name?

1625
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,680
Phamama-Man?

1626
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,100
Hey, Phamama-Man.

1627
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:17,780
No, I'm good.

1628
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,200
I thought we talked about the melons.

1629
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,040
Unfortunately, I signed up for the monthly melon
subscription.

1630
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:24,740
Wait, where can...

1631
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,400

1632
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:26,800
Phamama-Man.

1633
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,040

01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,160
Oh, we get to play with him.

1639
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:07,270
His name is Phenomenal Man.

1640
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,650
Wait, I can't say it.

1641
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,870
His name is Phenomenal.

1642
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:13,210
I thought it was Phenomenal Man.

1643
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:14,150
Wait.

1644
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:18,110
You may call me Phenomenal.

1645
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:19,170
Phenomenal.

1646
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:19,990
That is my name.

1647
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:23,550
Phenomenal Man.

1648
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,150
Big fan.

1649
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:28,850
I'm a big Phenomenal man fan.

1650
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:31,770
Is that the wet janitor who shakes fire?

1651
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:32,730
Mama ma'am!

1652
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:35,130
Wait, I've been calling him that this whole time!

1653
01:48:35,530 --> 01:48:36,610
He knows who I am!

1654
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:39,150
Waterboy's very excited to work with you.

1655
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:40,310
Phenomenal.

1656
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:43,410
Oh my gosh, we actually get to work!

1657
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:44,610
Oh geez, okay.

1658
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:48,710
The cult of Chad is using the chaos to summon their god
through human sacrifice.

1659
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:50,810
The cult of Chad.

1660
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:54,910
Wait, we gotta save, or not save, we gotta send Malevolu.

1661
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:58,130
Oh, his stats are...

1662
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:58,450
Okay.

1663
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,650
I want to send her though.

1664
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,810
Could be worse, I guess.

1665
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:04,090
That's the spirit.

1666
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,010
What's her?

1667
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:07,050
Her powers again?

1668
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:08,930
Oh, let's just heal.

1669
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:11,910
Oh, uh, creates a portal.

1670
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:15,430
Stats are good.

1671
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:21,690
Wait, we can find- He's so sad!

1672
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:27,190
For Mama Man, flies to all locations, greatly reducing
travel time.

1673
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:28,970
Okay.

1674
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,250
Okay.

1675
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,090
Let's just call him Melon Man.

1676
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:36,430
Melon Man!

1677
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:37,410
Melon Man!

1678
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:41,630
Wait, Min, what's on your mind?

1679
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:44,350
He's so sad.

1680
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:46,770
Let's just send the two of them, I think they got it.

1681
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:50,390
Get me on my jet right now.

1682
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:51,210
Utopia.

1683
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:54,450
Thank you for your streams.

1684
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:56,210
I've been feeling down lately, but thanks to you, feel
better.

1685
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:56,850
Thank you, Vito.

1686
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:58,310
Thank you, Rick!

1687
01:49:58,310 --> 01:50:00,550
I'm glad I could help in any way.

1688
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:02,570
Escort.

1689
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:04,470
What would be escorting?

1690
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:05,710
Protector?

1691
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:08,430
I think probably...

1692
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:10,590
I think Golem can one-man this.

1693
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:13,590
Stadium's on fire.

1694
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:14,850
We're suspecting explosives.

1695
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:15,910
We need backup.

1696
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:17,950
Stadium's in flames.

1697
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:18,790
Put out the fires.

1698
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:19,890
All right, Waterboy.

1699
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:22,270
It's all...

1700
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:23,650
This is a...

1701
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,010
Wow.

1702
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,770
It's all you.

1703
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:28,230
It's all...

1704
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:29,510
You.

1705
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:31,910
It's all you.

1706
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,850
It's literally him.

1707
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:35,830
I don't...

1708
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:36,830
What's his quirk?

1709
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:38,110
Or his power?

1710
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:40,170
No.

1711
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,490
He didn't assign himself.

1712
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:44,470
Oh, because I have...

1713
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:45,810
I have been sending him.

1714
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:50,760
And then...

1715
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,800
Oh, he no longer is...

1716
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:52,540
Oh, that's right.

1717
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:52,860
That's right.

1718
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,740
I forgot that he doesn't do that anymore.

1719
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,340
He will heal.

1720
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,220
So it doesn't really help, honestly.

1721
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:12,400
he can't just he just can't do it quickly but i think it'd
be really good i could have him heal coupe actually now that

1722
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:23,960
i think about it coupe is injured you can't really tell
though i could have her heal she's hurt right that's why she

1723
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:33,760
has like her her she's not oh I thought that's why her
mascara was running, unless she's always been like that.

1724
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,060
Oh, just kidding.

1725
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,140
Everyone got healed in the cutscene.

1726
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:42,780
Lucky them?

1727
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:43,160
Shit.

1728
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:47,020
The DTLA branch are all accusing each other of being red
ring spies.

1729
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:47,800
Uh-oh.

1730
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,200
Um...

1731
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,660
Prism, I think you've got this.

1732
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,060
Or...

1733
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,560
Prism?

1734
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,900
Flambé and Prism, maybe.

1735
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,620
I love a symmetrical stage picker.

1736
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,640
Yeah, let's do the two of them.

1737
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:05,720
And then...

1738
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,020
Superhero backup requested.

1739
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Giant monster on the beach.

1740
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:10,220
It's tearing the pier apart.

1741
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,280
Take down the Kaiju.

1742
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,120
Evacuate.

1743
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:35,210
Oh no, Gollum's busy.

1744
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:38,810
We can wait a little bit of time.

1745
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:42,030
Maybe we can get for Mama Man and, you know...

1746
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:43,210
Oh yeah.

1747
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:47,250
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1748
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:01,910
Hamster!

1749
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:05,670
You are certified for that forklift, alright?

1750
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:07,550
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1751
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:09,410
I got a hack there.

1752
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:10,610
Wait, okay, before I hack.

1753
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:11,450
Alright.

1754
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:12,350
Water boy?

1755
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:15,010
What?

1756
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:15,870
What's happening?

1757
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,350
You're gonna work with your... Actually, should I send in
the...

1758
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:19,890
Okay, hold on.

1759
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:21,510
You're not going to work with your hero.

1760
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:21,990
I'm sorry.

1761
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:22,610
Close your eyes.

1762
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:24,450
Your hero is going to the Kaidu.

1763
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:30,550
I think honestly he could solo it.

1764
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:34,130
Did you know that every time the city grows, it becomes
larger?

1765
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:36,290
He'll work with his Oshi eventually.

1766
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,870
This starts throwing punches.

1767
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:44,390
Rally against the real enemy.

1768
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:45,790
I think that is charisma.

1769
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:47,950
So we would...

1770
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:54,230
that oh yeah easy easy

1771
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:08,050
okay all right the university security system was triggered
and we've got students locked inside oh difficulty hi scary

1772
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:16,270
oh my goodness oh god lee oh okay sorry i always forget that
these are

1773
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:23,710
Left left, right up.

1774
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:29,990
Left left right up left left right up left left right up.

1775
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:35,710
Timer was going kind of fast before.

1776
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,040
Oh.

1777
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,160
Wait.

1778
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:45,360
Wait.

1779
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:48,020
Wait.

1780
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:59,420

1782
01:55:25,230 --> 01:55:31,110
back for the other oh my gosh ah okay Okay, we got this, we
got this, we go.

1783
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:32,490
Oh, I don't got this.

1784
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:33,210
Oh, shoot.

1785
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:35,450
Ah, I don't got this.

1786
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:38,970
I went the wrong heckin' way.

1787
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:42,070
Okay, we got this.

1788
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,410
Good thing there's nothing chasing after me.

1789
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:47,630
It'd be pretty bad.

1790
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:53,090
Let her cook.

1791
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:56,190
The students have been rescued.

1792
01:55:58,510 --> 01:55:58,970
Okay.

1793
01:55:58,990 --> 01:55:59,750
Alright.

1794
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:01,930
What's going on?

1795
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:04,630
The Kaiju has a red ring collar around its neck.

1796
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:06,850
They must be controlling it.

1797
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:10,330
I think either.

1798
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:12,990
We can either attack it or break it.

1799
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:15,090
Break the collar!

1800
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,300
Uh oh.

1801
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,640
We did not make it.

1802
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,380
There's no time for this.

1803
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:28,620
Oopsie.

1804
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:30,940
He's so sad.

1805
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:31,980
Go home.

1806
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:33,600
Oh, hold.

1807
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:34,800
Dang it.

1808
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:41,860
Oh, no.

1809
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:43,700
Mama man.

1810
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,120
Uh, great.

1811
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:48,620
High call volume.

1812
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,760
He's really depressed.

1813
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,460
Because fuck us, right?

1814
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:53,640
Fucking couch.

1815
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:56,560
So Mama man needs only two seconds of rest.

1816
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:01,260
However, if any call fails or misses, he will be depressed
and need 45 seconds of rest.

1817
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,360
Oh, he's depressed right now.

1818
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:05,180
Hey, uh, seeing this shit?

1819
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:06,320
What is that?

1820
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:18,220
is that whatever it is it sounds like more shit oh that
doesn't oh my god yo z team been a while miss me oh sonar

red ring will scramble well here's that cannibalism she's a

1824
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:52,340

01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:07,380
part human i think it still counts true matter.

1827
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:09,340
Blazer can't fight her own battles anymore.

1828
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,000
Oh.

1829
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:10,960
Whoa, what's happening?

1830
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:11,740
Oh.

1831
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,220
Cool.

1832
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,560
Interrogate Sonar's crew.

1833
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,120
Intimidate Sonar's crew.

1834
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:19,820
Subjugate the cult Sonar's crew.

1835
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:23,520
Success will reduce Sonar's forces.

1836
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,040
He looks so sad.

1837
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:30,620
If I did this, well, it's not enough to interrogate, maybe.

1838
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:39,600
Water boy.

1839
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:41,680
This could be it.

1840
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:43,580
This could be it.

1841
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:49,030
We don't have enough...

1842
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:50,410
Wait, we don't have enough charisma.

1843
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,550
I don't think we have enough charisma.

1844
01:58:59,330 --> 01:59:01,590
A valuable lesson in uncertainty.

1845
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:06,250
I wonder if Coupe and Punch-Up would be better.

1846
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:07,330
Wait, she needs to be...

1847
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:09,010
She needs to be the second slot.

1848
01:59:09,930 --> 01:59:10,110
There.

1849
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:11,490
Swift is the knight.

1850
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:12,770
Sharp is my knight.

1851
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:15,170
I think they would be better.

1852
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:16,570
Let's just try them.

1853
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:18,830
We'll have them work.

1854
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:18,970
Don't worry.

1855
01:59:19,070 --> 01:59:20,030
We'll have them work together.

1856
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:20,650
That's rich.

1857
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:21,910
Diffuse the bomb.

1858
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:24,870
If you are sure, I'm willing.

1859
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:25,310
No, it's this one.

1860
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:25,830
It's this one.

1861
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:27,750
These two.

1862
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,110
They'll do it.

1863
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:31,650
Crime is much easier to stop.

1864
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:32,790
And he got healed!

1865
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:33,610
It's good.

1866
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,010
It's good.

1867
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:34,950
It's good.

1868
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:37,790
I think Prism can...

1869
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:38,470
Let's go, bitches.

1870
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:39,850
Can solo this one.

1871
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:41,190
It's just a fuse it.

1872
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:42,770
Oh, dang.

1873
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:44,750
I didn't know we had it like that.

1874
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:48,830
Red rings put up a roadblock.

1875
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,210
Destroy the roadblock.

1876
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:52,550
Brace yourself for oncoming fire.

1877
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:58,630
I think Golem can solo this.

1878
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:03,150
Honestly, we healed his heart.

1879
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:05,910
We healed his heart.

1880
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:09,430
I think Golem can solo this.

1881
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:15,650
Oh, what's this?

1882
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:20,810
Oh, easy.

1883
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,650
Oh, wow.

1884
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:25,330
Oh, golly.

1885
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,930
For Mamaman is already ready to...

1886
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:32,010
I understand there are higher priorities for SDN at this
moment.

1887
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:36,510
Vanderstank's girlfriend is demanding a coffee from Santa
Monica be brought to Vanco.

1888
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:51,570
Okay, hold on.

1889
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:53,750
Robert, got any Z-teamers nearby?

1890
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:55,130
I need help with evacuation.

1891
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:56,330
Evacuation.

1892
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:00,050
can do the other.

1893
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:05,950
I feel like Famama Man can do that mission.

1894
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:12,530
We've got another gang out here with Red Ring Tech.

1895
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:25,890
Is this coffee of dire importance?

1896
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:31,630
I think he could do it.

1897
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:35,610
I think he could do it.

1898
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:40,550
He's also like our fastest guy and he doesn't need to so
whatever.

1899
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:45,610
Um...

1900
02:01:45,610 --> 02:01:48,310
I'm gonna send...

1901
02:01:54,570 --> 02:01:56,110
Help Pom Pom.

1902
02:01:56,910 --> 02:01:57,790
Pom Pom.

1903
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:02,830
Carry civilians that cannot move themselves.

1904
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:06,590
I feel like I need to send both of them.

1905
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:08,710
I feel like...

1906
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:12,710
If he fails at coffee, I swear...

1907
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,690
Hold on, they're kind of...

1908
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:31,590
slow we might be able to let's see how this is going oh my
god oh my god we killed it that was like as close as you

1909
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:44,950
could have possibly gotten that's crazy that's crazy no no
no no oh that was so Nice!

1910
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,150
And we did it?

1911
02:02:51,170 --> 02:02:51,650
Okay.

1912
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:54,610
Can you imagine?

1913
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,230
Let's see.

1914
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:13,450
Mobility?

1915
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:14,790
I do need some more mobile.

1916
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:15,670
Well, I have Flambé.

1917
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:16,230
It's mobile.

1918
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:18,690
If I'm a man, it's pretty mobile too.

1919
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:22,910
But it would be nice to have that area kind of covered,
right?

1920
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:25,310
Like just a little bit more of a triangle.

1921
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:29,710
I say so.

1922
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:43,250
I think so.

1923
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:47,490
It's an important little bit, I'd say.

1924
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,470
Okay.

1925
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:53,030
Alright, we need to do those other two.

1926
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:54,450
Oh!

1927
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:57,750
Oh, that was so close!

1928
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,450
Oh my goodness gracious!

1929
02:04:00,210 --> 02:04:01,110
That was scary.

1930
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:02,810
Okay, alright, we need to do these two.

1931
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:04,070
Hey, he's moving.

1932
02:04:04,410 --> 02:04:05,490
That's kinda not good.

1933
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:10,150
Alright, for Mamma Man, Water boy!

1934
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:11,370
Can I?

1935
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:12,070
Can I?

1936
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:12,450
Am I?

1937
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:13,730
It's up to you too.

1938
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:14,090
All right.

1939
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:16,310
And then these two...

1940
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:19,390
What's Malevolah's powers again?

1941
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:21,070
Oh.

1942
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:22,290
She just heals.

1943
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:22,730
That's right.

1944
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:25,910
Let me fry somebody, please.

1945
02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:27,210
My money's on Voiza.

1946
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:35,030
I guess Waterboy and Malevolah would have had their synergy
thing going on, but I want him to be with his Oshi.

1947
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:37,330
I want him to be with his Oshi.

1948
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:37,570
I want him to be with his Oshi.

1949
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:38,290
That's a way of my sweet.

1950
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:38,910
Thanks.

1951
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:48,130

the handcuffs okay i'll send coupe it's coupe a golem wait

1952
02:04:48,130 --> 02:05:03,910

superhero into battle like it's even killing oh yeah i think

1953
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:05,670

1954
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:11,550
I'm the alpha.

1955
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:14,510
I'm the alpha.

1956
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:14,610
I'm the alpha.

1957
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:17,030
I hate the shit you ever said.

1958
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:19,290
Oh, oh, oh, that was so scary.

1959
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:21,610
I'm the alpha.

1960
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:24,770
Civilians escorted, baby.

1961
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:27,290
Nice, malevola, let's go.

1962
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:28,490
Watch me burn.

1963
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:29,670
More stuff, okay.

1964
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:32,690
That was gross to hear.

1965
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,390
I didn't like it at all.

1966
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:37,090
Gang arrested.

1967
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:38,730
Okay, all right, hold on.

1968
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:40,390
before we sent her out.

1969
02:05:40,730 --> 02:05:42,670
Wait, it's gonna disrupt our...

1970
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:43,310
No!

1971
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:47,430
It's gonna disrupt our everything!

1972
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:48,690
We'll go with mobility.

1973
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:51,750
Probably.

1974
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:56,900
No!

1975
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,700
It's straight in the middle though.

1976
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,380
Just don't upgrade.

1977
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:07,220
Get it to five all?

1978
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,900
Okay, we'll get it to five all.

1979
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,840
Alright, let's see what we got going on here.

1980
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:18,620
the roadblocks weaken the bridge guess we'll just have to
hold it up ourselves hurry before it collapses lend your

1981
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:26,080
strength to oh everybody's resting okay we'll let them rest
what is this one found the distributor of the red ring tech

1982
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:32,980

1983
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:42,500
mr fister the red ring lieutenant with attack enhancement mr
fister no no one's in danger but we've paid good money for

1984
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:51,900
this service what else could possibly be keeping you new
gated community has been set ablaze no civilians are in

1985
02:06:51,900 --> 02:07:07,420
danger okay we can still we can still get flambe at least
maybe even malevolah oh oh boy okay never mind this one

1986
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:17,420

1987
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:17,900
strength!

1988
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,680
Wait, is it- oh wait, is it combat or vigor though?

1989
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:21,820
Wait, hold on.

1990
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,640
I still get confused about them.

1991
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,960
Because in my brain, they're the same thing.

1992
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,660
You have to be strong to have combat.

1993
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:36,560
It is vigor, isn't it?

1994
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:37,680
Dang it.

1995
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,900
We could do this- Holy moly.

1996
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,160
It's kind of overkill.

1997
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,200
Let's do...

1998
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,880
Wait, let's...

1999
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,380
For Mamamam Sholo.

2000
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:01,290
Or...

2001
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:03,490
Holy fucking shit.

2002
02:08:03,690 --> 02:08:05,650
I think we... I guess he's not...

2003
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:07,290
He's... He needs to be healed.

2004
02:08:07,470 --> 02:08:08,190
Still on my feet.

2005
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:09,210
Let's do this.

2006
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:11,170
Let's do this one.

2007
02:08:11,550 --> 02:08:12,950
Yeah, yeah, this should be good.

2008
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:15,030
Kimmy just got a whole lot more fun.

2009
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:16,070
There we go.

2010
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,530
What's going on here?

2011
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,280
B!

2012
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:25,240
B!

2013
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:32,500
He doesn't need healing, but his stats are lower because of
it, no?

2014
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:35,520
Yeah, and it does buff Malevola.

2015
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:36,240
So true.

2016
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:40,610
Oh my goodness.

2017
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:41,170
Okay.

2018
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:44,830
Uh, attack in it.

2019
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:50,880
It doesn't reach.

2020
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:52,160
It doesn't reach.

2021
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,960
His stats can't get low.

2022
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:56,340
What?

2023
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,060
Am I crazy?

2024
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:58,940
Why was it red then?

2025
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:02,020
Why was his thing red then?

2026
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:06,660
Oh.

2027
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:10,240
Oh.

2028
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:11,320
Gosh.

2029
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,660
Okay, you guys can't blame me, though.

2030
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,000
I just unlocked it literally like 20 minutes ago, okay?

2031
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:18,780
Okay.

2032
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,840
I just unlocked it like 20 minutes ago.

2033
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,420
I can't blame you.

2034
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:25,920
Oh my gosh, there's so much happening.

2035
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:26,500
This one.

2036
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:29,380
Mr. Fister, we gotta get this guy.

2037
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:32,820
I'm sending you in.

2038
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:34,480
For Mamma Man.

2039
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:37,700
Uh.

2040
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:43,750
So close.

2041
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:47,150
Alright.

2042
02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:47,990
Very good.

2043
02:09:49,710 --> 02:09:50,670
I'm not blaming.

2044
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:51,750
Thank you.

2045
02:09:53,590 --> 02:09:54,730
Oh, this place.

2046
02:09:55,070 --> 02:09:56,890
I'm just...

2047
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:57,290
What?

2048
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,110
You know what?

2049
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:58,590
Water boy?

2050
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:01,730
You got this, solo.

2051
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:08,470
Red ring creep Smile Moore took over the radio station.

2052
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:10,790
She's trying to brainwash the citizens!

2053
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:14,610
With her red ring implant, Smile Moore is able to convince
her enemies of anything.

2054
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:16,910
Only someone with strong mental fortitude.

2055
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:23,640
Let's wait for Kupai.

2056
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,200
Maybe?

2057
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,420
Or is it...

2058
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,420
It says...

2059
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,360
What the fuck?

2060
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:33,660
Why is the neighborhood watch mobilizing against the red
ring?

2061
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:35,260
Flambé.

2062
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:43,920
Protect the well-meaning, but defenseless and weak civilians
against their overpowered enhanced opponents.

2063
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:47,660
Not the weak and defenseless civilians!

2064
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:57,940
I think Flambé has to go in here, but I'm scared that it's a
vigor thing and not a combat thing.

2065
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:06,050
No, it must be a combat thing.

2066
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:08,090
Combat and vigor.

2067
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:28,590
I don't want to send call me a bogo bitch hmm protect sounds
like vigor right hmm this should be enough though it should

2068
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:40,190
be good I'll just send them both finally I was getting sick
of flying over the same boarding holdings now I've got I was

2069
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:41,030
scared for a second.

2070
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:42,010
I was like, wait a second.

2071
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:44,270
I forgot that it was the first.

2072
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:47,110
Okay, you.

2073
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:49,730
Hey, that red-ring creeps Smile Moore took over the radio
station.

2074
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,450
She's trying to brainwash the citizens.

2075
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:53,130
All right, we're going to say in the coupe.

2076
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,670
Wait, can I sign coupe?

2077
02:11:56,250 --> 02:12:00,730
For Bamaman is not really with a strong mental fortitude,
but that...

2078
02:12:00,730 --> 02:12:02,130
Okay, let's see what we got going on.

2079
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:05,010
Close your eyes.

2080
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:07,290
You're not going to like what you see anyway.

2081
02:12:08,370 --> 02:12:10,270
Why do I even need to send him?

2082
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:14,250
But I think...

2083
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:16,230
I think it needs more...

2084
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:21,410
Just a little more of the charisma.

2085
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:25,010
Oh, Coupe does have retry, you're so right!

2086
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:28,230
Is there... what's her other...

2087
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,450
Graceful.

2088
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:32,390
The other one is mobility.

2089
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,170
Yeah, we'll just do this one then.

2090
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:35,530
Okay, we'll just try.

2091
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:36,770
I'll give her something to smile about.

2092
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:40,930
I think he's got this.

2093
02:12:42,430 --> 02:12:43,150
I never doubted.

2094
02:12:45,610 --> 02:12:48,650
I never doubted for even a second.

2095
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:54,410
Civilians are headed towards their doom!

2096
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:56,730
There's no way they can handle the red ring!

2097
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:01,410
Aid them in the fight.

2098
02:13:03,490 --> 02:13:04,210
Water goat.

2099
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:05,530
He's too good.

2100
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:09,630
Honestly, we could do a couple of these.

2101
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:12,930
We could move them to say, I'll aid them.

2102
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:16,370
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

2103
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:19,780
Easy.

2104
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,040
Fight, fight, fight!

2105
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:23,100
You're my VIP.

2106
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:25,320
Shit, you're mine too.

2107
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:29,160
Okay, we can't fight Batman yet again.

2108
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,480
Oh, oh.

2109
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:38,980
Is that really how it went?

2110
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:40,320
Are you sure?

2111
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:44,200
No, no, please!

2112
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:45,300
Oh my god!

2113
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,400
Oh my god!

2114
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,200
Oh this is... Oh no!

2115
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:54,260
Oucha.

2116
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,220
Wait, why is he depressed?

2117
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:57,080
Oh, because...

2118
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,460
We gotta go solo Dolo when they count the most.

2119
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:01,860
We're just... failing slower.

2120
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,140
That's how I feel, bruh.

2121
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:04,600
They got a straight team, bruh.

2122
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:05,960
Hitting us everywhere.

2123
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:07,660
Can't get a win no kind of win.

2124
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:08,380
You're right.

2125
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:10,140
Hey, listen up.

2126
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:10,780
This isn't working.

2127
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:11,980
This is what they want.

2128
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:17,500
Okay, they send us to every corner of the city spreading us
then forcing us to travel back and forth No more coming back

2129
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:18,580
to base between calls.

2130
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:25,240
Okay, we stay out for as long as we can So your plan is for
us to get more tired than we already are Are you sure it

2131
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:26,680
gets your butt handed to us?

2132
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:35,400
Oh, so embarrassing So we need to switch it up be less
predictable z team what happens today will live on and Head

2133
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:40,080
in first battle we break be the one who you say some
inspiring shit or try to at least Hi.

2134
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:41,980
Everybody.

2135
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:48,300
That looks like when you're in a Discord and it says
everyone is typing at once.

2136
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:49,820
Just want to talk.

2137
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:55,810
Everyone.

2138
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:01,270
Several people are typing.

2139
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:03,810
Okay.

2140
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:04,670
Okay.

2141
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:05,030
Oh, wait.

2142
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,090
Who do I have here?

2143
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:08,150
Oh, I almost did not.

2144
02:15:08,290 --> 02:15:08,430
Level.

2145
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:08,910
Wait.

2146
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:10,710
It's not you.

2147
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:11,270
It's Coupé.

2148
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,410
Dug.

2149
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:12,970
Dug.

2150
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:16,690
We're gonna do more charisma.

2151
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:19,250
Because that really put us out.

2152
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:26,600
I love Flambé.

2153
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,580
I love the inspiring stuff he says.

2154
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:29,880
Yeah?

2155
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:34,480
Blazer, I'm assuming he's talking about.

2156
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:37,040
About.

2157
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,080
Oh, wait.

2158
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,040
We could do.

2159
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:40,220
You sure, bro?

2160
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:42,500
What the fuck is going on?

2161
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:43,000
No, we can't.

2162
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,420
We can't.

2163
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:44,240
I'm still here if you need me.

2164
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:46,080
No, we can't.

2165
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,640
You're not going to like what you see anyway.

2166
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:48,400
Wait.

2167
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,100
Guess what?

2168
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:50,760
No.

2169
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,060
Oh, wait.

2170
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,400
That's not who I meant to put in.

2171
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:54,880
Can I?

2172
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:56,860
Am I ready for this?

2173
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:57,940
Everybody's too smart.

2174
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:01,260
But we can do Flambé and Malevilla.

2175
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,060
Let's rip him up.

2176
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:05,680
I think that'll be good.

2177
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:08,840
Uh.

2178
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:11,760
Okay, good doc.

2179
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:12,700
Yo, Ravi.

2180
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:14,180

2184
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:47,900
Sharp as the knight.

2185
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:49,420
Sharp as my knife.

2186
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:50,720
I'm willing.

2187
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:58,380
I think I'll do this one instead of Flamama Man.

2188
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,280
Much obliged.

2189
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:02,540
You're welcome.

2190
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,480
Z team's gonna stop us?

2191
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:05,900
That's rich.

2192
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:14,990
That's evil.

2193
02:17:15,210 --> 02:17:17,630
It goes all the way to that X corner.

2194
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:19,870
Wait, you're not allowed to touch that.

2195
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:26,640
Is she okay?

2196
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:33,080
Wait, beefcake?

2197
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:34,880
Didn't we fight her last week?

2198
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:35,420
Beef?

2199
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:37,620
She was the one attacking the Frigo's base.

2200
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:41,040
Convince beefcake to surrender peacefully?

2201
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,880
I think Prism can solo this.

2202
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:47,520
I think Prism can solo this.

2203
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:48,640
Maybe.

2204
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:49,400
Probably.

2205
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,440
We gotta fight this guy again.

2206
02:17:54,960 --> 02:18:01,400

2212
02:18:58,090 --> 02:18:59,770
Oh my god.

2213
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:02,190
Age redacted.

2214
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:04,330
God, she's old.

2215
02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:05,590
Yeah!

2216
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:11,110
Several brand deals and film commercials in Europe.

2217
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:13,730
Oh my god.

2218
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:16,550
5-11.

2219
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:21,210
Okay, what are we doing?

2220
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:25,090
Yo, we've got to play.

2221
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:26,370
but we need backup.

2222
02:19:26,710 --> 02:19:28,430
We could actually turn this around.

2223
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:30,430
Automatons are headed for the city.

2224
02:19:30,710 --> 02:19:34,190
Construct a trap to help dwindle their numbers.

2225
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:36,270
We need somebody smart.

2226
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:37,990
I have nobody smart.

2227
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:42,150
I have nobody smart.

2228
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:43,410
We'll wait for Coupé.

2229
02:19:44,470 --> 02:19:45,590
But we also gotta fight this guy.

2230
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:47,110
Wait, what's this right here?

2231
02:19:48,090 --> 02:19:49,690
I've always wanted to take over a city.

2232
02:19:50,290 --> 02:19:51,330
It was on my vision board.

2233
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:52,030
Oh my god!

2234
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:55,090
Is it because I was...

2235
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:56,230
was too slow with sonar?

2236
02:20:03,690 --> 02:20:05,210
The age of redacted is in demand.

2237
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:05,910
So true!

2238
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,010
Praise the sun!

2239
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:08,210
It was?

2240
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:08,670
Dang.

2241
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,330
Okay, okay.

2242
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:10,930
We gotta fight him then.

2243
02:20:11,250 --> 02:20:12,410
Oh no, they got hurt!

2244
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:13,630
Oh no, they got hurt.

2245
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:14,330
Uh-oh.

2246
02:20:14,530 --> 02:20:15,270
Uh, that's not good.

2247
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:16,710
Um, let's see.

2248
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,410
Um, Malevilla can...

2249
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:20,170
Um, okay.

2250
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:22,410
I was gonna send Waterboy, but...

2251
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:25,110
But that's what he said to do.

2252
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:26,910
Okay, we can send Waterboy still.

2253
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:30,390
Waterboy can heal Malevilla.

2254
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:32,450
What's happening?

2255
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:35,310
Remains strong through his attacks.

2256
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:37,490
Dodge has dive bombs.

2257
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:41,250
They don't really have much combat.

2258
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:42,110
That's the thing.

2259
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:43,230
Sweating again.

2260
02:20:43,470 --> 02:20:44,050
Am I?

2261
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:46,270
It doesn't change anything.

2262
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:51,820
Holy cow.

2263
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:53,480
Flambe?

2264
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:54,460
Oh, that's true.

2265
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:56,740
Yeah, we can...

2266
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:58,920
We'll do that instead because, uh...

2267
02:20:58,920 --> 02:20:59,220
Yeah.

2268
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:02,580
He'll still heal him.

2269
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:05,200
Oh, that's nice.

2270
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:05,440
Okay.

2271
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:08,860
And Coupe?

2272
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:11,980
You are so much.

2273
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,860
You're not gonna like what you see anyway.

2274
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:24,350
I think she could do it.

2275
02:21:26,290 --> 02:21:27,030
I think she could do it.

2276
02:21:33,130 --> 02:21:34,130
I think she could do it.

2277
02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:36,170
Level up for the heal.

2278
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:38,150
Coupe is not down.

2279
02:21:39,170 --> 02:21:39,910
Coupe is not her.

2280
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:47,890
Her and Blaze, I think that would be like a total waste of
Blaze.

2281
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:51,890
Is Malevolet heal herself?

2282
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:52,130
No.

2283
02:21:52,650 --> 02:21:53,650
She doesn't heal herself.

2284
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:56,410
At least she hasn't in the past.

2285
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:57,250
I could try.

2286
02:21:57,430 --> 02:21:58,050
I'll try it.

2287
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,770
Yeah, see?

2288
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:00,690
She doesn't heal herself.

2289
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:05,510
Oh, I'm escaping on the USS Iowa.

2290
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:07,270
Seize them before they get away.

2291
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:09,290
What if I put him with Blonde Blazer?

2292
02:22:10,530 --> 02:22:12,310
Wouldn't that be so awkward?

2293
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:18,230
Wouldn't that be like So awkward.

2294
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:21,550
We can do this.

2295
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:24,110
Ah, laser.

2296
02:22:24,770 --> 02:22:27,250
You're looking well.

2297
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,710
Same to you, Phenomenon.

2298
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:33,030
I still have your hairbrush.

2299
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:37,230
I've been using it to comb my mustache.

2300
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:41,190
Oh, why don't you just keep that then?

2301
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:43,590
Oh, gross.

2302
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:48,070
The automatons are almost there, we need to think fast.

2303
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:49,250
Get smart!

2304
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:51,490
Aw, I should have sent him.

2305
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:54,050
What is their ship?

2306
02:22:55,710 --> 02:22:58,070
If they are a fire and water.

2307
02:22:58,730 --> 02:23:00,050
My tail's wagging, I swear.

2308
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:05,410
All right, wait, what is, what is she, what is Prism doing?

2309
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:06,830
She's been over there for.

2310
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,410
Help!

2311
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:08,950
We're trapped on the bridge!

2312
02:23:09,410 --> 02:23:10,090
Oh geez!

2313
02:23:10,390 --> 02:23:10,870
Uh oh!

2314
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:14,810
Um, collapsing, rescue the civilians before the bridge
collapses.

2315
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:18,210
Oh, um, hold on, guys.

2316
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:20,490
Steamy boys.

2317
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:22,230
Steam?

2318
02:23:24,350 --> 02:23:24,990
Crazy.

2319
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:27,570
Crazy work.

2320
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:30,430
Okay, Prism's back in business.

2321
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:32,450
Oh, I thought she was faster.

2322
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:36,370
Oh, Coupa is almost done.

2323
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:40,500
We could do...

2324
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:43,400
Okay, this is going to be like crazy overkill.

2325
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,160
Praiseful, but deadly.

2326
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:49,860
Because I want...

2327
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:52,240
I want to heal.

2328
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,300
I want to heal Prism.

2329
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:58,380
What I could try and do is get Waterboy with Malevola and
Prism and have the three of them heal.

2330
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:00,040
Oh, Mamma Man.

2331
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:01,480
Oh, my God.

2332
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:02,440
It's crazy.

2333
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,000
It's so overkill.

2334
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:08,920
It's so overkill.

2335
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:16,820
Yeah, yeah.

2336
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:17,300
Stop.

2337
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:18,360
Stop it right now.

2338
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:18,760
Stop.

2339
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:19,580
Yeah.

2340
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:21,540
Nice.

2341
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:22,940

Max it all, max it all!

2346
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:06,070
Nothing beats the original, but this will have to do.

2347
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:08,250
What if I just do this though?

2348
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:09,350
What if I just...

2349
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:13,210

2350
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:16,090
But then, uh, hold on.

2351
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:20,090

2355
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:30,870

2356
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,950
I'm the alpha.

2357
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:33,930
Time I acted like it.

2358
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:34,790
Why me alpha?

2359
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:37,430
That's the most beta shit you ever said.

2360
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:39,390
Why me alpha?

2361
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:44,490
Overkill?

2363
02:25:47,010 --> 02:25:48,850
I had to give him everything we've got.

2364
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:50,370
My ring stole one of our news copters.

2365
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:52,310
They're firing down at civilians.

2366
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:54,710
Jesus Christ, take that copter out now.

2367
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:57,710
Flambé is good for this.

2368
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:00,630
Pinpoint an appropriate location for landing.

2369
02:26:01,010 --> 02:26:02,610

Hold on.

2385
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:32,490
I want to see them do this first.

2386
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:33,090
Uh-oh.

2387
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:34,470

02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:45,370
Hey, great work, team.

2391

Couple more calls and we're...

2392
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:49,530

02:26:51,350 --> 02:26:52,530
Protected Los Angeles!

2394
02:26:52,730 --> 02:26:53,170
Yippee!

2395
02:27:04,330 --> 02:27:05,470
Backup generator?

2396
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:06,790
Should already be on.

2397
02:27:10,570 --> 02:27:10,990
Chase.

2398
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:11,910
Oh,

2399
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:16,880
he's in the infirmary.

2400
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:29,150
But the backup generator's on, so...

2401
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:33,390
Look at you, you're being a hero.

2402
02:27:34,110 --> 02:27:35,070
Oh, beef!

2403
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:38,990
Yeah, what's the procedure for this?

2404
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:45,570
Okay.

2405
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:55,590
All right, take care of him.

2406
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:58,590
Oh.

2407
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:02,390
Fat dog.

2408
02:28:02,910 --> 02:28:05,330
Yeah, it was really big.

2409
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:09,610
Oh, I trusted you, Vizzy.

2410
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:11,470
You were wrong for this.

2411
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:13,210
I defended for you.

2412
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:14,550
You fucking put me down.

2413
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:16,310
I didn't do anything.

2414
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:19,150
No, no, I caught you.

2415
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:20,730
I caught you red-handed.

2416
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:21,310
Whoa, whoa, look.

2417
02:28:21,310 --> 02:28:22,590
What's going on?

2418
02:28:22,710 --> 02:28:23,750
What's going on?

2419
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:24,610
Use your head.

2420
02:28:24,990 --> 02:28:25,390
Hey, hey.

2421
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:27,290
The fuck is going on.

2422
02:28:27,850 --> 02:28:29,070
She tries to steal your mech suits.

2423
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:30,410
Oh, fuck off.

2424
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:31,550
And break my heart, brother.

2425
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:33,370
But Vizzy is a traitor.

2426
02:28:34,030 --> 02:28:35,310
She played all of us.

2427
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:36,710
That's not what I was doing.

2428
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:38,170
I'm trying to help you.

2429
02:28:38,370 --> 02:28:38,930
I trust her.

2430
02:28:38,930 --> 02:28:39,850
I believe her, though.

2431
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:43,590
Never again.

2432
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:44,570
No, wait, wait, wait.

2433
02:28:44,830 --> 02:28:45,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2434
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:48,870
Whoa, whoa.

2435
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:50,190
Does stand there and does not stand there.

2436
02:28:50,190 --> 02:28:50,350

2454
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,970
Why won't you...

2455
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:46,390
Mr. Whiskey, is that his name?

2456
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:50,170
Alright, untie me.

2457
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:52,790
What?

2458
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:54,690
Why are you looking- You didn't lie to me?

2459
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:56,770
But you didn't- tell me the truth.

2460
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:57,950
Ooh.

2461
02:31:00,670 --> 02:31:02,130
I'd love to sit here and explain.

2462
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,170
Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

2463
02:31:03,210 --> 02:31:05,970
But a pile of red-ring assholes are streaming into the
building right now.

2464
02:31:06,190 --> 02:31:07,970
I just don't understand why you wouldn't tell me.

2465
02:31:08,250 --> 02:31:08,530
Yeah.

2466
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:11,350
I was worried Shroud would come after you.

2467
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:12,170
Well, he did.

2468
02:31:12,510 --> 02:31:15,190
So if I gave it to you, he'd have the pulse right now.

2469
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:17,630
I was...

2470
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:19,330
I was trying to protect you.

2471
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:19,750
Yeah.

2472
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:24,810
Well, the internal bleeding I've got from your old boss
isn't making me feel...

2473
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:25,890
I trust her blood.

2474
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:26,310
Really?

2475
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:32,560
Thumbstick.

2476
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:33,300
What?

2477
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:34,740
It's his name.

2478
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:36,860
Because he sticks you with...

2479
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:39,660
They're all fucking idiots, Robert, but they're dangerous.

2480
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:41,220
I'm not fucking around.

2481
02:31:41,380 --> 02:31:41,900
Untie me.

2482
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:43,920
He looks stupid, but he is a killer.

2483
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:45,820
You don't have powers.

2484
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:47,180
You need my help.

2485
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:48,840
Just let me help.

2486
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:49,780
Please.

2487
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:50,360
Oh my gosh.

2488
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:54,640
Wait, I want to do it alone so bad, but I'm kind of tired
because I don't think I'll live.

2489
02:31:55,960 --> 02:31:57,500
I want to do it alone so bad.

2490
02:31:58,580 --> 02:32:00,560
and cut you loose, but his toolboxes are locked.

2491
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:02,260
What did he do that for?

2492
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:03,720
Oh, I fucking wonder, Vizzy.

2493
02:32:03,860 --> 02:32:06,560
Why would he lock up his tools around invisible criminal
thieves?

2494
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:08,160
Robert.

2495
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:11,360
Uh-oh.

2496
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:12,220
Uh-oh.

2497
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:12,620
Wait.

2498
02:32:13,220 --> 02:32:13,940
Oh, great.

2499
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:14,660
Good.

2500
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:18,920
Are we in kindergarten?

2501
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:23,120
You doing something alone is a death sentence.

2502
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:24,820
But I believe in myself!

2503
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:27,960
I believe in myself!

2504
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:30,640
They have guns actually though.

2505
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:32,180
And we have scissors, safety scissors.

2506
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:35,000
So, and a...

2507
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,660
And a two scissors.

2508
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:38,920
Creepy.

2509
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:48,710
Oh.

2510
02:32:49,750 --> 02:32:52,090
Dang it, I thought that was gonna be a...

2511
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:53,230
QTE.

2512
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:54,390
Hold it in, dude.

2513
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:55,230
Hold it in.

2514
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:03,950
Oh!

2515
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:09,070
Why would you even need the keycard for this stupid shit?

2516
02:33:09,490 --> 02:33:10,130
Get this place.

2517
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:25,800
I like

2518
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:30,650

2519
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:35,050
Three, two.

02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:40,450
Oh, come on.

2521
02:33:40,530 --> 02:33:41,670
Let me have my moment.

2522
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:48,220

I'm not gonna do it.

2531
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:31,380
You wanted to have the dignified death.

2532
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,500
Alright, go get your suit.

2533
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:34,820
Wait, shouldn't we stick together?

2534
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:36,060
Oh my god.

2535
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:44,520
The game just saved.

2536
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:50,200
Oh yeah, punch him!

2537
02:34:50,820 --> 02:34:53,340
Oh, not- wow, he folded like paper.

Oh, it took was one punch.

Oh, dang.

2542
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,140
Robert.

2543
02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:06,060
Crazy.

2544
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:08,520
Make a man.

2545
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:09,420
Make a man.

2546
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,100
Oh, he's saving it, though.

2547
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:19,260
It's kind of smart.

2548
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:32,080
Yeah, broid.

2549
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:32,820
Yeah, broid.

2550
02:35:49,190 --> 02:35:51,490
That jumping punch is called super mad.

2551
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:53,530
It's Superman.

2552
02:35:58,410 --> 02:35:59,010
It's crazy.

2553
02:35:59,230 --> 02:35:59,510
Ho!

2554
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:10,570
Yeah!

2555
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:14,170
Oh my gosh.

2556
02:36:14,930 --> 02:36:16,770
You thought he'd never be Mecca Man again!

2557
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:20,590
Oh, this is the premium package.

2558
02:36:20,850 --> 02:36:22,990
Roy, you really outdid yourself.

2559
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:24,790
Mecca again.

2560
02:36:25,370 --> 02:36:26,730
Just done riding a bike, huh?

2561
02:36:27,570 --> 02:36:28,150
Yeah!

2562
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:34,090
We can handle these guys.

2563
02:36:34,330 --> 02:36:35,290
No problem.

2564
02:36:35,630 --> 02:36:36,870
This is great.

2565
02:36:37,250 --> 02:36:38,390
Oh, and this guy again.

2566
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:45,070
Obviously, the suit doesn't work without the Astral Pulse,
so it is really nice of you to bring it to us.

2567
02:36:45,870 --> 02:36:47,810
Wait, he can use the other Astral Pulse.

2568
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:48,630
There's like a fake.

2569
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:53,730
All he has to do is take off the sticker, and then Shroud
will think that he has the Astral Pulse.

2570
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:56,090
And all your friends.

2571
02:36:56,750 --> 02:36:58,110
That freaked out, fuck you are!

2572
02:37:02,210 --> 02:37:12,490
right sure because it looks like this guy's arms are killing
me or just give us the pulse and we'll let you live with

2573
02:37:12,490 --> 02:37:22,090
broken broken arms of course both arms each each one gets
okay we see the casts you're making it weird you're making

2574
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:31,830
it weird where shroud that is that is that what you're
asking yeah that's what i said right What the fuck am I

2575
02:37:31,830 --> 02:37:32,450
waiting for?

2576
02:37:32,730 --> 02:37:34,090
Okay, we're good.

2577
02:37:35,630 --> 02:37:35,930
Crazy, right?

2578
02:37:36,930 --> 02:37:39,890
It's like real big, but super quiet.

2579
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:41,350
So cool.

2580
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:43,290
So fucking cool!

2581
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:54,410
Oh my god!

2582
02:37:54,730 --> 02:37:55,370
It's freaky!

2583
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:58,170
A weapon to survive!

2584
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:01,550
I need to help me build a mech if I help to build Astral
Pulse.

2585
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:03,350
Poor 14x player.

2586
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:06,410
That's what this is all about.

2587
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:09,590
You need it to power your stupid spider shit.

2588
02:38:09,630 --> 02:38:10,750
It's not stupid.

2589
02:38:11,650 --> 02:38:12,950
Come on, kid.

2590
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:15,510
It was in the post to power a Mac.

2591
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:18,150
It's like plugging your cell phone into a nuclear reactor.

2592
02:38:19,150 --> 02:38:19,250
No.

2593
02:38:20,370 --> 02:38:21,410
Have we skipped this part?

2594
02:38:22,410 --> 02:38:23,910
I think I like Shroud, though.

2595
02:38:24,010 --> 02:38:25,050
Can we just skip this part?

2596
02:38:25,270 --> 02:38:28,350
I don't need to know what you would have done if I didn't
stop it.

2597
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:29,710
Which I'm about to do.

2598
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:31,270
Oh.

2599
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:34,530
Oh, they don't like that.

2600
02:38:35,110 --> 02:38:36,010
I hate toxic.

2601
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:36,710
He's so annoying.

2602
02:38:37,370 --> 02:38:39,010
I know that's literally how he's meant to be.

2603
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:40,630
But he's just so annoying.

2604
02:38:41,910 --> 02:38:43,630
Minto is so effin' cool.

2605
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:48,410
Ah, Missile Fury!

2606
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:51,890
Oh gosh, I can't even say it right.

2607
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:04,700
Oh!

2608
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:07,060
You are right, brother!

2609
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:09,840
Flurry!

2610
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,820
Like, yeah, like a Mick Flurry!

2611
02:39:18,580 --> 02:39:19,660
Cluster bombs!

2612
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:22,140
And whop!

2613
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:27,900
Is it like predicting all of his moves?

2614
02:39:28,060 --> 02:39:29,660
Because that's pretty much it.

2615
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,240
We tried yet.

2616
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:33,760
Or is this just the warm-up round?

2617
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:39,460
Yeah, that's not good.

2618
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:41,620
Oh my god.

2619
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:44,780
destroyed.

2620
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:50,760
Still got that new car shine.

2621
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:55,340
How do you breathe in there with all that smoke?

2622
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,800
Plug the controller into the second floor.

2623
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:02,260
My calculations are just showing up 30 seconds ago.

2624
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:03,580
Sorry.

2625
02:40:04,220 --> 02:40:04,780
Disappoint.

2626
02:40:05,460 --> 02:40:05,940
Two up.

2627
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:07,360
Freaky.

2628
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:09,840
I can tell you a boring life is without surprises.

2629
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:12,800
Well, then it's a good thing.

2630
02:40:12,820 --> 02:40:14,940
I can't even predict what these idiots are gonna do.

2631
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:18,000
My team!

2632
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:18,960
They're all stupid!

2633
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:20,120
They're unpredictable!

2634
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:21,480
What the fuck?

2635
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:31,000
When did she learn that?

2636
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:36,560
Is that Prism's second power that I didn't unlock?

2637
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:37,700
Oh wait, no!

2638
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:39,540
It's just her first power because she duplicates!

2639
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:41,320
Oh my god.

2640
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:44,020
Wow!

2641
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:45,700
Yeah!

2642
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:46,920
Yeah, get mudded.

2643
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:53,780
Oh, oh, oh.

2644
02:40:57,680 --> 02:40:59,080
The outcome is the same.

2645
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:07,410
Ah, I'm

2646
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:12,310
part of the action, guys.

2647
02:41:16,210 --> 02:41:18,650
He's like a magic cart personified.

2648
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:19,570
It's so good.

2649
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:31,900
The goat.

2650
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,600
The Z team.

2651
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:46,820
Whoa, whoa!

2652
02:41:49,620 --> 02:41:50,140
Malevolah.

2653
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:51,700
So cool.

2654
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:52,980
Oh, shoot.

2655
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:53,460
Oh my gosh.

2656
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:57,200
No!

2657
02:41:57,740 --> 02:42:01,500
I, I, I, well, I did kind of do that quick time event kind
of.

2658
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,540
I'm part of the action.

2659
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:06,720
I'm part of the action.

2660
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:10,540
From Mammaman!

2661
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:12,720
I hope my saving you from...

2662
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:14,640
Collision was appropriate.

2663
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:16,360
It was phenomenal.

2664
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:18,000
Wait, they're not gonna get back together.

2665
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:18,700
Please say no.

2666
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:19,900
Wait.

2667
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:31,100
What if he got stolen?

2668
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:32,640
Or if she stole her from me?

2669
02:42:34,220 --> 02:42:34,660
Oh, great.

2670
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,040
Well, I'll just go then.

2671
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:38,540
Miss a bitch.

2672
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:39,580

2673
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,760
We never finished our dance.

2674
02:42:42,760 --> 02:42:43,600
Get in the chair.

2675
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:44,380

from From I see you Metal Gear.

2679
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:23,580
And I hated fighting those two.

02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:50,700
She temporarily blinded me.

2712
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000

2713
02:47:14,280 --> 02:47:15,080
Oh, nice.

Calm down.

2715
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:19,360
It was your weak hand.

2716
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:20,460
You can still jerk off.

2717
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:25,660
Maybe if you grip it with the 7-1, hold it with...

2718
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:27,160
Yeah, you know what?

2719
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:27,640
Fair enough.

Wait.

2725
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:36,680
That's no good.

2726
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,120
Wait, okay, I'm paying attention.

2727
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:38,820
I'm in the action.

2728
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:40,700
I'm in the action.

2729
02:47:48,410 --> 02:47:48,770
Wait.

2730
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,700

2731
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:14,970
Oh shit, oh shoot, okay, I'm locked in.

2732
02:48:17,950 --> 02:48:18,650
Oh my god.

2733
02:48:22,470 --> 02:48:25,830
I can't even tell what's happening because I'm looking out
for QTEs.

2734
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:28,250
I'm not even looking out for the fight scene at all.

2735
02:48:30,670 --> 02:48:32,190
Oh shoot, I missed one.

2736
02:48:33,750 --> 02:48:35,290
I'm Osu time, for real!

2737
02:48:37,110 --> 02:48:38,630
I've never played Osu.

2738
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:39,570
Oh!

2739
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:50,300

2740
02:48:58,060 --> 02:48:58,480
Uh-oh!

02:49:02,380 --> 02:49:02,700
What?

2742
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:20,620
You're the only one I told about my amulet, so I figured he
wouldn't see it coming.

2743
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,320
Oh!

2744
02:49:24,460 --> 02:49:25,460
Oh my god!

2745
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:26,640
Holy shit.

2746
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:27,860
Look at you.

2747
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:30,040
When did she have the time to do this?

2748
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:30,920
Yeah, look at me.

2749
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:32,940
Oh yeah.

2750
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:37,000
Oh my god!

2751
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,340
Wait, what?

2752
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:48,480
The laser always did have a soft spot for helpless losers.

2753
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:50,380
Fuck off.

2754
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:54,440
Oh my god, steamy boys.

2755
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:03,580
Not so good at seeing now, are you?

2756
02:50:06,380 --> 02:50:08,360
Sexy no Jutsu!

2757
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:10,140

02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:15,860
the theme song!

2759
02:50:38,860 --> 02:50:43,960
Not even Shroud understands what is happening with Waterboy.

2760
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:51,980
Oh yeah, Mandy.

2761

Is it over?

2766
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:04,080
We fucked them in the face.

2767
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:09,360
Oh my god, hug by Azores.

2768
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:10,600

Why is everyone so tense?

2776
02:52:52,780 --> 02:52:55,180
Don't worry, I'm not gonna drop him.

shitty prototype.

2793
02:55:05,820 --> 02:55:05,920
Oh.

2794
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:09,520
I'm a bad person, but I'm a man of my word.

2795
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:11,560
Give me my pulse.

2796
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,020
You all hear that?

2797
02:55:20,060 --> 02:55:23,440
I've been through all the game theory on this moment a
thousand times.

2798
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:24,140
The game theory.

2799
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:26,260
I'm not steps ahead.

2800
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:27,060
I'm miles.

2801
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:29,140
So...

2802
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:30,540
Two steps ahead.

2803
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:32,120
Don't fucking test me.

2804
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:33,740
Give it both.

2805
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:36,840
What could that be?

2806
02:55:39,900 --> 02:55:47,780
what the fuck is this robert you said you wanted the
astropulse you figure it out i gave it to one of those is it

2807
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:57,380
they look fucking identical robert look you're right i came
out smart because you know what i'm not a smart guy so the

2808
02:55:57,380 --> 02:56:06,300
only way to keep you from knowing what i don't know i have
any idea what i'm doing which is how i feel all the time but

2809
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:14,420
i trust my gut and i take best guess just like you used to
do before you plugged all those fucking Christmas lights

2810
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:26,140
into your head before you were afraid to make your own
decisions Elliot Elliot maybe we wait till we get home shut

2811
02:56:26,140 --> 02:56:27,780
the fuck up

2812
02:56:31,860 --> 02:56:42,630
who fuck you you What's wrong with the red?

2813
02:56:42,750 --> 02:56:43,270
You want the blue?

2814
02:56:48,100 --> 02:56:51,540
It's hard to say which one, if it's the right one or not.

2815
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:53,200
Uh-oh.

2816
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:57,880
He wants the blue juice instead of the red juice.

2817
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:04,400
Okay, so far he's looking to get powerful, but it could mess
up.

2818
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:11,860
That was worth the wait.

2819
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:21,360
what's happening oh whoa everybody else is awesome oh no oh
wowy okay

2820
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:39,800
feel that you fucking fucks I told you I fucking told you
clouds you feel the power I see it now I can see it all whoa

2821
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:46,160
so I guess it was the right one but I don't think so I don't
know Oh.

2822
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:48,440
All right.

2823
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:49,800
Nanomachines.

2824
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:52,630
Fuck.

2825
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:54,080
Wait.

2826
02:57:54,600 --> 02:57:57,000
Just a hunch, but I'm starting to think that you guys are
wrong.

2827
02:57:57,400 --> 02:57:58,020
Oh, nah.

2828
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:00,120
It's just...

2829
02:58:00,120 --> 02:58:00,400
Oh.

2830
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:02,740
Uh-oh.

2831
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:04,500
Oh, no.

2832
02:58:04,700 --> 02:58:07,960
Oh, no, the nanomachines.

2833
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:10,620
Oh, no.

2834
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:13,680
Invisibish.

2835
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:39,200
I just in time Be a deer and help me get this Oh whoa Oh my
god Whoa fuck I see What the fuck That's a matter shroud

2836
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:57,040
didn't see that coming Oh my god Oh my god.

2837
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:57,300
Oh my god.

2838
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:08,200
Yeah, you're gonna throw it away, right?

2839
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:13,420
There she goes.

2840
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:19,400
She stole your kill.

2841
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:20,120
She died!

2842
02:59:22,620 --> 02:59:24,180
She winked at us, though.

2843
02:59:24,360 --> 02:59:24,640
Cute.

2844
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:26,100
Ew!

2845
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Ew!

2846
02:59:27,740 --> 02:59:33,140
Didn't see that coming.

2847
02:59:33,240 --> 02:59:34,940
We failed as a mentor!

2848
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:36,900
What?

2849
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:38,020
Oh my god.

2850
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:38,840
No way.

2851
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:40,060
Why would we fail?

2852
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:42,200
Literally

2853
02:59:46,350 --> 02:59:47,850
everybody was saved.

2854
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:54,920
Our team did good!

2855
03:00:01,060 --> 03:00:03,360
Shroud was dispatched.

2856
03:00:10,670 --> 03:00:15,970
It was a targeted attack by Shroud and those miserable
jerks, the Red Ring.

2857
03:00:16,510 --> 03:00:20,910
There's a story out there that Shroud was actually killed by
a former SDN employee.

2858
03:00:21,290 --> 03:00:21,690
Care to comment?

2859
03:00:22,010 --> 03:00:25,130
That I don't think I can call...

2860
03:00:25,770 --> 03:00:26,250
Collaborated?

2861
03:00:27,050 --> 03:00:28,370
No, but it is corroborated.

2862
03:00:29,570 --> 03:00:30,050
Collaborated?

2863
03:00:30,570 --> 03:00:30,830
My hymn, though.

2864
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:34,410
I can say that she did us a damn favor because that Shroud
motherfucker had to go.

2865
03:00:35,050 --> 03:00:35,290
Oh, shit.

2866
03:00:35,630 --> 03:00:36,890
Beef drinks the blood of the enemies.

2867
03:00:37,070 --> 03:00:37,330
It's true.

2868
03:00:37,330 --> 03:00:37,810
We can break it out.

2869
03:00:38,450 --> 03:00:39,770
Shit, that's the only reason I'm talking.

2870
03:00:40,210 --> 03:00:41,950
Point the camera over...

2871
03:00:43,070 --> 03:00:45,390
These are the real heroes right here.

2872
03:00:45,530 --> 03:00:46,230
Yeah, my team!

2873
03:00:47,230 --> 03:00:47,290
Yeah!

2874
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:50,930
Does your team have a name?

2875
03:00:51,530 --> 03:00:52,010
Uh...

2876
03:00:52,010 --> 03:00:52,910
Z team!

2877
03:00:53,570 --> 03:00:54,530
Z team!

2878
03:00:54,970 --> 03:00:58,150
You're the best heroes in the whole motherfucking SDN.

2879
03:00:58,150 --> 03:01:00,770
Actually, I'm hearing now we can't bleep the curse words.

2880
03:01:01,030 --> 03:01:02,890
Reporting live from SDN 12.

2881
03:01:03,570 --> 03:01:04,210
Back to the studio.

2882
03:01:04,990 --> 03:01:07,010
Punch up barely in the shot, get Mike Wazowski.

2883
03:01:08,450 --> 03:01:09,910
Z-team saved the day.

2884
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:10,410
Yay!

2885
03:01:11,090 --> 03:01:12,010
You get to return to the Mecha Mans.

2886
03:01:12,570 --> 03:01:13,430
Defend SDN.

2887
03:01:13,470 --> 03:01:15,410
Couldn't have done it without you.

2888
03:01:16,430 --> 03:01:16,890
Seriously.

2889
03:01:18,210 --> 03:01:20,950
All the work you put into the suit is what made this
possible.

2890
03:01:21,670 --> 03:01:21,910
Nah.

2891
03:01:22,350 --> 03:01:22,610
Nah.

2892
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:23,970
It's not the hard part.

2893
03:01:23,970 --> 03:01:25,870
Do you want an explanation for how Vizzy works?

2894
03:01:26,150 --> 03:01:26,350
No.

2895
03:01:26,590 --> 03:01:27,270
Well, no.

2896
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:29,390
Obviously you can do that stuff too.

2897
03:01:29,610 --> 03:01:33,750
I saw you were throwing those red ring fuckers around like
graduation caps.

2898
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:34,510
No joke.

2899
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:36,030
I started to feel bad for them.

2900
03:01:36,170 --> 03:01:37,150
It was mesmerizing.

2901
03:01:37,150 --> 03:01:40,230
Yep, that was a fun girl for sure.

2902
03:01:40,990 --> 03:01:42,810
I don't get some sleep, bruh.

2903
03:01:43,250 --> 03:01:44,150
Not a clean-up tomorrow.

2904
03:01:46,050 --> 03:01:47,590
Good job, Mecca, man.

2905
03:01:48,630 --> 03:01:48,970
Yeah.

2906
03:01:52,870 --> 03:01:53,910
Hee hee.

2907
03:01:59,790 --> 03:02:00,810
My girl.

2908
03:02:01,210 --> 03:02:01,590
Hey, hey, hey.

2909
03:02:02,530 --> 03:02:03,490
The bat in the suit?

2910
03:02:04,030 --> 03:02:04,730
Yeah, he's with us.

2911
03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:07,250
Yeah, that's a founding VP member right there.

2912
03:02:07,390 --> 03:02:08,190
No way.

2913
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:11,810
What do you think?

2914
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:20,050
they earn a pardon no is that my call you're the one oh my
god i have to decide again

2915
03:02:23,490 --> 03:02:33,210
fine yeah sure why the fuck not hey yeah no they're with us
i i don't have to deal with him anymore so he can join again

2916
03:02:33,210 --> 03:02:42,790
it's the end of the game guys i i got to go the entire game
without him

2917
03:02:50,770 --> 03:03:04,370
redemption hey so you maybe got an extra one of those I do
actually really one but a good one I wasn't I mean where'd

2918
03:03:04,370 --> 03:03:09,610
all the extra beers come from oh there's a ton of booze in
the wreck room that's where they got it I honestly shocked

2919
03:03:09,610 --> 03:03:10,770
it hasn't into an issue.

2920
03:03:11,750 --> 03:03:12,730
Oh, shit.

2921
03:03:12,990 --> 03:03:13,490
No powers.

2922
03:03:14,050 --> 03:03:14,690
I got it.

2923
03:03:14,770 --> 03:03:16,390
Forced open beers like a normie.

2924
03:03:20,810 --> 03:03:22,810
I'm getting drunk like a normie, too.

2925
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:24,230
One beer!

2926
03:03:24,230 --> 03:03:26,130
I've had half a beer, and I'm already feeling it.

2927
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:27,190
Half a beer!

2928
03:03:30,430 --> 03:03:31,450
What did he just do?

2929
03:03:31,790 --> 03:03:31,930
Oh.

2930
03:03:32,810 --> 03:03:34,390
So, is that permanent?

2931
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:38,010
Nah, he's borrowing it until we can figure out a different
solution.

2932
03:03:38,350 --> 03:03:39,390
He's trying to wash his hands.

2933
03:03:40,070 --> 03:03:40,990
Surely is.

2934
03:03:42,330 --> 03:03:43,190
That's the one.

2935
03:03:43,990 --> 03:03:46,030
Well, looks like he'll enjoy it while it lasts.

2936
03:03:47,210 --> 03:03:49,110
I feel so obvious when you look back.

2937
03:03:50,050 --> 03:03:51,290
She never bought in, did she?

2938
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:53,790
I think there was a chance at some point.

2939
03:03:54,310 --> 03:03:55,650
What do you think Fizzy's gonna do now?

2940
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:59,890
I figured she was kind of a loner, but she took Shroud's
mask.

2941
03:04:00,910 --> 03:04:02,110
I just hope she's alright.

2942
03:04:02,470 --> 03:04:03,450
I don't hate her, though.

2943
03:04:04,350 --> 03:04:05,290
I just hope she's okay.

2944
03:04:06,830 --> 03:04:07,290
Yeah.

2945
03:04:08,970 --> 03:04:09,810
Yeah, me too.

2946
03:04:15,220 --> 03:04:16,580
Any plans tonight?

2947
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:22,260
You're asking me if I have plans for after getting ambushed
by Shroud and the Redman?

2948
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:25,540
Ah, was that too weird a way of asking if you wanted to make
out later?

2949
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:27,120
No.

2950
03:04:28,320 --> 03:04:29,580
She wants to make out now!

2951
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:31,640
It was perfect.

2952
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:32,120
Oh.

2953
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:34,300
She wants to make out now!

2954
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:36,720
Now is later!

2955
03:04:40,120 --> 03:04:41,660
We kissed on a car!

2956
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:42,420
That's the...

2957
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:45,880
the achievement.

2958
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:47,460
Yippee!

2959
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:49,140
Seriously, when the team's off Monday?

2960
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:53,040
I was just trying to figure that out.

2961
03:04:59,110 --> 03:05:00,930
I think you might need to go.

2962
03:05:01,350 --> 03:05:01,610
Why?

2963
03:05:01,890 --> 03:05:03,450
Why are they so mean to me?

2964
03:05:04,610 --> 03:05:05,470
By all means.

2965
03:05:08,090 --> 03:05:10,370
Oh my god, I'm getting princess carried by everybody.

2966
03:05:10,690 --> 03:05:11,790
I knew when I told you so about Vizzy.

2967
03:05:12,330 --> 03:05:14,290
But instead, I'm just gonna try to make you throw up.

2968
03:05:17,490 --> 03:05:21,570
Oh my god, he's taking me to see the stars, the clouds.

2969
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:22,650
Oh my gosh.

2970
03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:23,410
Wow.

2971
03:05:24,770 --> 03:05:24,830
Okay.

2972
03:05:30,090 --> 03:05:30,550
Hippip.

2973
03:05:30,770 --> 03:05:31,170
Hooray.

2974
03:05:31,650 --> 03:05:32,310
Let me get a picture.

2975
03:05:33,610 --> 03:05:34,070
Hippiporay.

2976
03:05:34,490 --> 03:05:34,810
Let me get a picture.

2977
03:05:34,990 --> 03:05:35,450
Hooray.

2978
03:05:35,610 --> 03:05:36,490
Okay, what's happening?

2979
03:05:36,690 --> 03:05:36,890
Okay.

2980
03:05:37,210 --> 03:05:37,390
Stop.

2981
03:05:37,570 --> 03:05:38,510
Wait, are we taking a picture?

2982
03:05:38,850 --> 03:05:39,830
What the fuck is this?

2983
03:05:40,090 --> 03:05:40,490
Like a baby.

2984
03:05:40,870 --> 03:05:41,230
Oh.

2985
03:05:43,790 --> 03:05:44,250
Yeah.

2986
03:05:44,750 --> 03:05:45,130
Thanks.

2987
03:05:45,130 --> 03:05:46,630
Hey, are you taking a picture?

2988
03:05:46,790 --> 03:05:47,210
What's happening?

2989
03:05:48,990 --> 03:05:49,630
Mr. Whiskey!

2990
03:05:50,390 --> 03:05:52,670
Oh, he doesn't know how to take photos.

2991
03:05:53,050 --> 03:05:53,530
Oh, yes he does.

2992
03:05:53,670 --> 03:05:54,450
He's- Oh, oh.

2993
03:05:54,550 --> 03:05:55,990
Instantly painful, actually.

2994
03:05:56,570 --> 03:05:57,050
Oh, no!

2995
03:05:59,370 --> 03:05:59,850
Yay!

2996
03:06:05,010 --> 03:06:05,970
He's okay!

2997
03:06:09,470 --> 03:06:12,270
So, ma'am, ma'am, watching Mandy and Robert make out.

2998
03:06:12,530 --> 03:06:13,090
Oh, no!

2999
03:06:13,170 --> 03:06:14,590
I didn't even think about that!

3000
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:26,800
Ending, I guess I got like the quote unquote not as not good
ending.

3001
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:29,760
It's a normal ending probably but not bad ending.

3002
03:06:31,160 --> 03:06:33,660
Doesn't seem like a bad ending, seems like a normal ending.

3003
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:47,620
But I feel like though, I don't know how the one where it's
good ending with Invisigal, but I feel like this sets up

3004
03:06:47,620 --> 03:06:49,500
really nicely for like a sequel.

3005
03:06:59,280 --> 03:07:00,380
Spank, thank you!

3006
03:07:05,990 --> 03:07:08,850
No bad endings, just hero and anti-hero ending.

3007
03:07:09,270 --> 03:07:10,370
Ah, okay, okay.

3008
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:17,830
Yeah, but I feel like it does set it up well, right?

3009
03:07:20,370 --> 03:07:21,890
I love Lame Blazo.

3010
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:30,510
It's my first time watching someone play through the game
and it was very fun watching your choices.

3011
03:07:30,710 --> 03:07:31,310
Thanks for the streams!

3012
03:07:31,810 --> 03:07:32,770
Thank you, Chiyaki!

3013
03:07:33,070 --> 03:07:33,870
Thank you!

3014
03:07:36,490 --> 03:07:39,510
I'm curious about other routes too now.

3015
03:07:39,510 --> 03:07:40,870
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3016
03:07:41,430 --> 03:07:43,010
Curious, curious.

3017
03:07:44,830 --> 03:07:45,470
The game has...

3018
03:07:45,950 --> 03:07:49,370
I remember reading somewhere that Aaron Paul said that this
was like...

3019
03:07:50,150 --> 03:07:51,710
He's never been in a game before?

3020
03:07:51,850 --> 03:07:54,230
Like, he never recorded, like done voice work for a game
before?

3021
03:07:55,610 --> 03:07:57,370
But also that like...

3022
03:07:57,970 --> 03:08:01,110
This was such a disorienting experience.

3023
03:08:02,770 --> 03:08:05,030
We have to know who it is!

3024
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:17,540
Like it's so confusing because you had to re-record certain
things that like Because obviously there's so many choices

3025
03:08:17,540 --> 03:08:23,840
It was like I can imagine it being like extreme I probably
would not know at all what the story is of this game It

3026
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:37,500
would be so confusing But yeah Yippee This voice acting was
so good So so good I just love the way you say brief Thanks

3027
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:40,400
for playing Minto Do I say it weird?

3028
03:08:43,880 --> 03:08:44,760
Thanks for the fun timing, though.

3029
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:46,540
I hope you check out the other choices sometime.

3030
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:48,420
There's a lot of good interactions and wholesome moments.

3031
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:51,340
Also, don't tell Nimmy you chose Blazer.

3032
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:56,460
Congrats, Minto.

3033
03:08:56,620 --> 03:08:58,000
Your playthrough was so much fun to watch.

3034
03:08:58,160 --> 03:08:58,800
Love your decisions.

3035
03:08:58,940 --> 03:08:59,860
Thank you, Andregos.

3036
03:09:00,060 --> 03:09:00,820
Thank you.

3037
03:09:01,720 --> 03:09:02,200
Let's see.

3038
03:09:03,820 --> 03:09:07,740
You and 61% of players deceive Shroud by giving him both
astral pulses.

3039
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:18,440
curious about the other choices especially if you just give
him the real one outright i feel like maybe i don't know you

3040
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:27,560
and 34 of players watched as a prison gal killed shroud
denying you the chance to exact vengeance or show mercy i

3041
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:38,120
guess you know what that's true i would have killed him but
um it was supposed to be my vengeance not hers you know what

3042
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:39,260
now i'm Now I'm mad at her.

3043
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:41,620
You know what?

3044
03:09:41,620 --> 03:09:42,980
I forgot that was the point.

3045
03:09:43,620 --> 03:09:46,020
Now I'm mad at her.

3046
03:09:48,220 --> 03:09:49,840
She heweed me.

3047
03:09:51,440 --> 03:09:52,760
She heweed me.

3048
03:09:54,180 --> 03:09:55,700
Oh my god!

3049
03:10:01,340 --> 03:10:04,040
Kill, steal, dying.

3050
03:10:06,360 --> 03:10:08,480
You and 87% of players trust you.

3051
03:10:08,500 --> 03:10:10,220
trusted Invisigal and untied her.

3052
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:14,120
That's a pretty strong insult.

3053
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,840
Glad you enjoyed the game, Rito.

3054
03:10:17,080 --> 03:10:20,200
If they make a sequel, be interested to see which of the
endings they can make.

3055
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:21,000
They make can't...

3056
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:21,400
Right!

3057
03:10:22,360 --> 03:10:24,640
I've played through twice myself to see different outcomes.

3058
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:25,340
Had fun watching.

3059
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:26,880
I imagine...

3060
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:32,140
I wonder if they would have it where, like, your save
imports into the second game.

3061
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:36,260
And so it just kind of picks up from where you...

3062
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:38,480
Where you...

3063
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:41,100
You, uh, I neglected her.

3064
03:10:42,340 --> 03:10:43,020
What are you?

3065
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:43,860
Five years old?

3066
03:10:43,980 --> 03:10:44,940
I'm not your mom.

3067
03:10:45,660 --> 03:10:46,780
Oh, my gosh.

3068
03:10:53,870 --> 03:10:55,530
Neglected like you're a child?

3069
03:10:59,150 --> 03:11:01,190
That's why you fail as a mentor.

3070
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:01,890
You know what?

3071
03:11:01,890 --> 03:11:03,350
I was not just a mentor to her.

3072
03:11:03,450 --> 03:11:05,270
I was a mentor to the entire team.

3073
03:11:05,570 --> 03:11:09,470
And I think I have a higher success rate than failure rate.

3074
03:11:09,870 --> 03:11:11,130
Thank you very much.

3075
03:11:11,450 --> 03:11:17,210
I think that most of the people on my team were still good.

3076
03:11:18,130 --> 03:11:20,750
And she is the only failure.

3077
03:11:21,510 --> 03:11:24,430
So, I think I'm doing perfectly fine.

3078
03:11:31,210 --> 03:11:37,010
You are leading her to embrace villainy over heroism.

3079
03:11:38,170 --> 03:11:38,770
Oh.

3080
03:11:43,060 --> 03:11:46,840
You and 32% of players fell for blonde blazer.

3081
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:48,260
Wow.

3082
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,020
Not so many.

3083
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:55,920
You and 73% of players defeated Sonar and saved Los Angeles.

3084
03:11:56,600 --> 03:12:00,540
You and 26% of players rescued Waterboy first over Goofy.

3085
03:12:05,080 --> 03:12:06,940
Nobody believes in him enough.

3086
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:09,900
I don't think that guy failed me ever.

3087
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:11,800
I don't think that guy failed me ever.

3088
03:12:11,820 --> 03:12:12,900
even once.

3089
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:16,100
Mighty fine, dispatching me, Dom.

3090
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:17,820
Way to win the power of not thinking.

3091
03:12:17,980 --> 03:12:19,340
Your choices were super fun to see.

3092
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:21,420
As always, you take our breath away.

3093
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:24,360
Actually that power will be super handy for catching your
music out.

3094
03:12:24,500 --> 03:12:25,120
Thank you for the stream.

3095
03:12:25,380 --> 03:12:27,160
Oh no, thank you for the peek.

3096
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:33,180
Waterboy cannot fail.

3097
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:34,800
He can only be failed.

3098
03:12:37,880 --> 03:12:41,480
You and 70% of players welcome Sonar back into the Z team.

3099
03:12:41,820 --> 03:12:49,100
How was I supposed- they- I probably would not if it was
just my decision, but because my whole team was just like,

3100
03:12:49,160 --> 03:12:50,380
yeah, he's one of us.

3101
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:52,560
I think I wouldn't have done it.

3102
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:56,840
They made it pretty hard to say no.

3103
03:12:56,940 --> 03:12:57,880
They really did.

3104
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:01,740
They were like, hey, don't arrest that guy.

3105
03:13:01,860 --> 03:13:02,720
He's one of us.

3106
03:13:02,980 --> 03:13:06,260
What if I was just like, nah, he can't sit with us?

3107
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,200
I got peer pressured into it.

3108
03:13:21,530 --> 03:13:25,550
If you failed the battle in dispatching bit, he just gets
jailed.

3109
03:13:25,650 --> 03:13:26,930
Oh, he doesn't even get to join you.

3110
03:13:27,430 --> 03:13:28,570
The power of peer pressure.

3111
03:13:30,490 --> 03:13:35,650
I wanted to try this game, but I don't have the time to play
games now, so I enjoy playing and along with you as if I

3112
03:13:35,650 --> 03:13:39,030
were playing with my little sister, just sitting there
watching her play.

3113
03:13:39,030 --> 03:13:41,950
No, well, thank you.

3114
03:13:45,690 --> 03:13:50,430
I hope it's just as frustrating as watching your little
sister playing a game where you're just like, what are you

3115
03:13:50,430 --> 03:13:50,790
doing?

3116
03:14:00,320 --> 03:14:02,220
I always wanted to be the little sister.

3117
03:14:02,700 --> 03:14:03,860
Wait, I am the little sister.

3118
03:14:05,620 --> 03:14:07,360
Sorry, I have an older sister.

3119
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:11,800
But my older sister doesn't care about games or anything.

3120
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:22,820
Your playthrough is great, you made many unique decisions,
others didn't.

3121
03:14:23,120 --> 03:14:24,920
Positive, it was very entertaining because of it.

3122
03:14:26,060 --> 03:14:28,880
I like causing a little bit of trouble.

3123
03:14:31,220 --> 03:14:33,380
You and 57% of players went on the coffee run.

3124
03:14:33,540 --> 03:14:37,460
You and 63% of players made invisible, put away thumbsticks.

3125
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:43,720
My boss said hero was from Amaman!

3126
03:14:44,220 --> 03:14:44,500
No!

3127
03:14:46,240 --> 03:14:46,680
Boy.

3128
03:14:47,620 --> 03:14:48,680
Thanks for the fun playthrough.

3129
03:14:49,660 --> 03:14:51,660
Inspired me to play a lot of new games in the last year.

3130
03:14:51,920 --> 03:14:53,020
Looking forward to this one too.

3131
03:14:53,540 --> 03:14:54,680
Thank you!

3132
03:14:57,740 --> 03:15:00,980
You got a line from Invisigal in episode 7 I never heard
before.

3133
03:15:01,360 --> 03:15:01,980
No way!

3134
03:15:03,660 --> 03:15:03,940
See?

3135
03:15:05,140 --> 03:15:08,840
It's always fun to have different perspectives of a game.

3136
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:13,560
Yeah, lots of different experiences.

3137
03:15:15,800 --> 03:15:19,320
You perform better than 80% of players in today's shift.

3138
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:23,060
I was gaming.

3139
03:15:25,880 --> 03:15:26,820
I was gaming.

3140
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:34,160
It was funny watching you instantly make choices that most
other people deliberated on.

3141
03:15:35,460 --> 03:15:39,340
And every man your robber always kept everyone guessing.

3142
03:15:40,080 --> 03:15:46,160
I kept you guys guessing what it was.

3143
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:48,000
say or do next?

3144
03:15:55,860 --> 03:15:56,460
Avert!

3145
03:15:58,500 --> 03:15:59,800
That's kind of scary.

3146
03:16:08,920 --> 03:16:09,960
That's awesome.

3147
03:16:10,500 --> 03:16:11,660
Yeah, I'm a little so random.

3148
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:13,860
My boss said, Hero Boss, go!

3149
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:18,060
You perform better than 60% of players across all shifts.

3150
03:16:19,140 --> 03:16:19,480
Cool.

3151
03:16:20,020 --> 03:16:20,620
That's not bad.

3152
03:16:21,060 --> 03:16:24,160
You activated a hero's power 252 times across all shifts.

3153
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:28,460
At least 252 and more to see.

3154
03:16:29,320 --> 03:16:30,100
Yes, sir.

3155
03:16:30,540 --> 03:16:31,300
No, sir.

3156
03:16:31,960 --> 03:16:32,720
Yes, sir.

3157
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:34,380
Vizzy put that guy.

3158
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:38,680
My most successful hero was Prism.

3159
03:16:38,740 --> 03:16:42,720
Prism is like, I wish I could have seen what her second
skill was, but she was really good.

3160
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:47,140
You barely succeeded on a call six times across all shifts.

3161
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:49,920
You sent the perfect hero for the call eight times.

3162
03:16:51,220 --> 03:16:53,960
Most successful shift was episode eight phase two.

3163
03:16:54,340 --> 03:16:55,440
Strongest hero is Coupe.

3164
03:16:55,940 --> 03:16:58,460
The person I did not fire.

3165
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:00,480
I don't think.

3166
03:17:00,540 --> 03:17:01,720
I made a mistake.

3167
03:17:02,940 --> 03:17:04,680
That's how you defeat Shroud, though.

3168
03:17:04,980 --> 03:17:06,620
It's narratively consistent.

3169
03:17:10,320 --> 03:17:12,520
The person that I kept on my team?

3170
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:16,200
Mm-hmm.

3171
03:17:24,410 --> 03:17:27,430
The dwarf get-go on the rooftop.

3172
03:17:28,490 --> 03:17:29,830
I thought they moved that guy.

3173
03:17:31,050 --> 03:17:32,130
That was fun.

3174
03:17:32,410 --> 03:17:33,230
That was fun.

3175
03:17:33,690 --> 03:17:36,930
I'll be honest, the first episode didn't hook me.

3176
03:17:36,990 --> 03:17:40,930
Or, like, the first time I played it, so it was, like, the
first three episodes.

3177
03:17:41,070 --> 03:17:46,050
It didn't hook me a ton, but the last playthrough really
hooked me.

3178
03:17:47,550 --> 03:17:49,490
I ended up having a lot of fun, though.

3179
03:17:49,870 --> 03:17:49,970
Yeah.

3180
03:17:52,490 --> 03:17:56,410
Covering up for Sonar like that after he raised half of L.A.

3181
03:17:56,410 --> 03:17:58,930
is a bigger part than Arochi Maru got.

3182
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:07,840
I enjoyed it more when, like, the...

3183
03:18:07,840 --> 03:18:08,900
I guess, like, the...

3184
03:18:08,900 --> 03:18:10,300
I enjoyed playing...

3185
03:18:11,580 --> 03:18:21,860
the dispatch part um but uh just like the story I was kind
of like okay this is cool um but once it got like more

3186
03:18:21,860 --> 03:18:23,480
serious I liked it a lot

3187
03:18:28,620 --> 03:18:37,100
so the cliffhanger is definitely the hook yeah what a solid
like last two episodes it was so fun looking forward to peer

3188
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:46,820
pressure saving you in season 2 great gaming Minto did they
say if there would be one oh my gosh i wonder what do you

3189
03:18:46,820 --> 03:18:58,880

3190

3191
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:16,400

3192
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:26,880
matt mercer threw that in there just for you so true and
then i got so caught up in it i didn't even notice the qte

a weeaboo sorry his voice actor matt mercer just killed the

3194
03:19:35,660 --> 03:19:42,640
role though so good can't wait for you to for your flambé
covered next karaoke stream which is

3195
03:19:47,640 --> 03:19:55,040
he almost killed your dog he wasn't gonna do it I just
needed to give him the thing and I did and he look at it

3196
03:19:55,040 --> 03:20:06,540
this way shrouds a ghost now I I liked that he was just like
he's like put some respect on blonde blazer she's one of the

3197
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:15,280
last real superheroes left I'm like yeah he gets it Shroud
and I are like one and the same.

3198
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:18,020
He gets it.

3199
03:20:18,140 --> 03:20:18,800
He gets it.

3200
03:20:22,820 --> 03:20:24,840
Thank you so much for the fun memories.

3201
03:20:25,580 --> 03:20:26,800
Jared, thank you.

3202
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:30,660
He's a villain, not a monster.

3203
03:20:30,900 --> 03:20:32,760
He's a really great villain.

3204
03:20:36,940 --> 03:20:38,660
But I prefer her, Bruna.

3205
03:20:40,540 --> 03:20:42,340
Yeah, he prefers her blonde.

3206
03:20:42,980 --> 03:20:45,820
We're like almost kindred spirits.

3207
03:20:47,980 --> 03:20:48,800
Oh, so close.

3208
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:49,760
So close.

3209
03:20:57,320 --> 03:21:00,880
On side note, I started getting MGS memes shorts on YouTube.

3210
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:03,660
I don't know where last weekend takes, I guess.

3211
03:21:05,640 --> 03:21:07,300
Minto, my guide and ghost lie.

3212
03:21:07,460 --> 03:21:10,140
I'm sorry, but you cannot do that much math.

3213
03:21:12,700 --> 03:21:15,660
had to have a machine do it all for him.

3214
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:21,060
And a mask to calculate it for him.

3215
03:21:21,120 --> 03:21:22,600
He literally had a built-in calculator.

3216
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:25,580
So...

3217
03:21:25,580 --> 03:21:30,300
My man was consulting ChatGPT every time he needed to do
something.

3218
03:21:36,650 --> 03:21:38,420
Is he really that much better than me?

3219
03:21:44,450 --> 03:21:45,630
This was good.

3220
03:21:46,350 --> 03:21:51,630
This And that's why he picked raw.

3221
03:21:57,960 --> 03:21:58,520
Uh-huh.

3222
03:21:59,560 --> 03:21:59,760
Yeah.

3223
03:22:00,940 --> 03:22:01,300
So.

3224
03:22:06,920 --> 03:22:08,780
Anyway, this is fun.

3225
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:10,180
This is fun.

3226
03:22:10,960 --> 03:22:14,180
Thank you guys for playing Dispatch with me.

3227
03:22:15,760 --> 03:22:17,400
What extras we got?

3228
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:20,160
Oh, just our choice stats now.

3229
03:22:23,770 --> 03:22:32,730
which we we went through all these just a while ago so yeah
what a funny what a funny situation to give him both though

3230
03:22:32,730 --> 03:22:40,950
I liked that I like that idea as soon as we defeated him
though and the fact that we had the second like the

3231
03:22:40,950 --> 03:22:48,030
prototype in our in our suit I was like there's no way that
we're not going to utilize this I was like there's so I was

3232
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:54,310
like he has to have something where he's just like not so
fast and I didn't expect to be with the dog, though.

3233
03:22:56,430 --> 03:22:58,770
I didn't expect it to be with beef, but that's okay.

3234
03:23:02,150 --> 03:23:05,870
It's always the wrong one when you give both?

3235
03:23:06,870 --> 03:23:07,010
Hmm?

3236
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:12,620
I love how Maddie got over being handed both.

3237
03:23:12,840 --> 03:23:14,640
I know he was so like what?

3238
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:15,360
What?

3239
03:23:16,540 --> 03:23:18,420
Shroud could never finish Mind Sweeper.

3240
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:20,260
Fun fact I made up.

3241
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,840
It's a fact because it's really...

3242
03:23:24,700 --> 03:23:29,700
It's, it's, it wouldn't be a fact if it weren't real.

3243
03:23:30,260 --> 03:23:33,980
So it's, it's a, it's real because it's a fact.

3244
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:40,220
Yeah, yeah.

3245
03:23:41,240 --> 03:23:43,160
That's a rock fact.

3246
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,140
It's a real fact.

3247
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:53,300
It's a, it's a fact because it's a fact, it's real.

3248
03:23:54,140 --> 03:23:58,380
Because he claimed to be, he said it's a fact.

3249
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:01,920
Wasn't planning on checking this one out, but your
playthrough was so fun.

3250
03:24:02,020 --> 03:24:02,620
I might check it out.

3251
03:24:02,860 --> 03:24:03,940
Thanks for another fun series we do.

3252
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:05,400
Thanks, Cap and Troll!

3253
03:24:06,080 --> 03:24:06,960
Thank you.

3254
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:08,960
Hot dog.

3255
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,840
How did Trout even steal beef?

3256
03:24:11,940 --> 03:24:12,720
That's so true.

3257
03:24:12,920 --> 03:24:14,000
How did he get the dog?

3258
03:24:14,820 --> 03:24:15,660
How did he get beef?

3259
03:24:16,320 --> 03:24:17,320
How did he get that guy?

3260
03:24:17,740 --> 03:24:18,480
Where was he?

3261
03:24:19,340 --> 03:24:21,860
He was in the room with...

3262
03:24:24,620 --> 03:24:26,760
with Chase

3263
03:24:30,830 --> 03:24:49,200
mysterious chat what the hell is she saying I'm making sense
I'm spitting facts I'm spitting facts Leaf was in on it no

3264
03:24:51,780 --> 03:25:02,000
no no sure me Now we're spitting something.

3265
03:25:06,940 --> 03:25:10,740
If you want my treasure, you're never going to find it.

3266
03:25:11,660 --> 03:25:15,380
I left it somewhere, but no one can find it.

3267
03:25:16,260 --> 03:25:19,960
I know I rhymed it with it, but I don't really care.

3268
03:25:21,080 --> 03:25:24,700
Because now, I'm going to wash my hair.

3269
03:25:25,400 --> 03:25:26,920
It's not in my hair.

3270
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:34,160
it's underneath my pillow why did i tell you that now i
gotta hide it again

3271
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:45,800

really good hiding spot for it thank you so much for this
