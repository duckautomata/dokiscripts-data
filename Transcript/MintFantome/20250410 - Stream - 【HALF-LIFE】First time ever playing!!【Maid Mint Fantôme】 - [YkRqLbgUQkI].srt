1
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Woah...

2
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,620
Welcome back, master and lady!

3
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
Hello everybody!

4
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,940
Hi!

5
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,060
How's the voice?

6
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,380
It's getting a little better.

7
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
It sounds a little better than before.

8
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,360
Maybe.

9
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,860
I still sound like I have a stuffy nose.

10
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,260
But I don't!

11
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,040
When I sound like, my voice is a little raspy still.

12
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,500
But it's okay.

13
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm not even sick!

14
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm not even sick, I just...

15
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
The glasses match perfectly.

16
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,500
I know!

17
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,760
I blame Paula.

18
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Me too.

19
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,460
Me too!

20
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,360
It's a cute voice.

21
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,900
Stop it!

22
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Stop it!

23
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,980
What nose?

24
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,460
Are we really doing this right now?

25
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,040
Anyways, hello everybody!

26
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,960
Welcome to Half-Life.

27
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,080
Full life consequences.

28
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,200
That's the only thing I know about this entire series.

29
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,440
No, that's a lie.

30
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,380
I also know...

31
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,140
Gary...

32
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,560
Gordon Freeman.

33
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,420
My favorite cute maid playing my favorite game series.

34
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,320
Let's go!

35
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,880
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

36
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,660
I know nothing about Half-Life.

37
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
And I was like, trying to decide.

38
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,860
This probably came out of super left field for people.

39
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,680
Why is she playing Half-Life all of a sudden?

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,240
And I was looking through my Steam library.

41
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,060
What am I going to play this week?

42
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm finishing up Devil May Cry.

43
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm finishing up Metal Gear Peace Walker.

44
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,780
I was like...

45
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,440
And then I saw that I have all of Half-Life.

46
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,660
And I was like, well, that's a series I've never played before.

47
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:07,720
And I really like playing things that are influential in the gaming sphere.

48
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,840
So, I was like, you know, maybe I'll check it out.

49
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
It's peak.

50
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,160
Yeah.

51
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,400
Impeccable taste.

52
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,600
Old?

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
I didn't say old.

54
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,060
You said old.

55
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,880
I did not say old.

56
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,100
I didn't say old.

57
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,800
You said old.

58
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Half-Life is a good choice.

59
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,280
Yeah, so it kind of came out of left field probably.

60
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,460
I haven't talked about wanting to play it at all or anything like that.

61
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,880
It's in the same universe as Portal, by the way.

62
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,240
I love Portal.

63
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,920
I recommend checking out Freeman's Mind and Accursed Farms.

64
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,180
Oh, buy Accursed Farms after this.

65
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,460
Very good fandom.

66
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
Before I...

67
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,620
Yes, I don't know anything right now.

68
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,880
I'm probably going to forget everything, literally everything that you guys tell me about.

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,260
I'm going to forget about literally everything you guys tell me about.

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,180
Because I don't know anything.

71
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,860
The lore is not complicated.

72
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,540
It's not?

73
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,460
I feel like there's so much Half-Life...

74
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,680
Oh my gosh, thank you for all the superchats.

75
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,560
I've got to read them in a second.

76
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,900
I feel like there's so much Half-Life...

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Content everywhere, you know?

78
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,960
I don't know what is Half-Life...

79
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,480
What is in the universe of Half-Life...

80
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,000
What is Gary's mod...

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,520
What is Team Fortress...

82
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
It's all the same stuff, no?

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,280
I don't know.

84
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,140
Right?

85
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,960
Half-Life is one of the greatest FPS's ever made?

86
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,720
Really?

87
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,320
I mean, I'm a Doom fan, so...

88
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,800
I rec...

89
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Fun fact, I went to high school with the guy who made Full Life Consequences.

90
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,580
What?

91
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,060
He and his friends introduced me to the series.

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
Half-Life 2 is one of my all time favorites.

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,740
Woah!

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,920
Woah!

95
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,220
Royalty.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,880
Can I get a happy birthday?

97
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,500
Mine was yesterday.

98
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,460
Happy birthday, JPC!

99
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,980
Happy birthday to you.

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
Happy birthday to you.

101
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,300
Happy birthday to you.

102
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,000
Happy birthday, JPC Shade.

103
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,080
Happy birthday to you.

104
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Happy birthday.

105
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,880
Have you played Signalus?

106
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,660
Oh, I have played Signalus.

107
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,740
Interesting man, but thank you for the recommendation.

108
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,220
Not counting Metal Gear, is this the oldest game you are making a full run of?

109
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,380
With Doom?

110
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,320
Wait, when did Doom come out?

111
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,800
Doom...

112
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,980
I think Doom is the oldest.

113
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Yeah, 1993.

114
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,780
Doom is the oldest game probably that I've done.

115
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,540
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,220
When did this?

117
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,060
98, no?

118
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,220
StarCreator, thank you so much for the pink!

119
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,920
John Freeman, who was Gordon Freeman's brother...

120
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,400
Was one day in an office typing on a computer.

121
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,440
He got an email from his brother that Minfantome was about to stream.

122
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,460
So yeah.

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,380
Yes.

124
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm gonna do my best.

125
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,620
I'm not really a...

126
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,400
FPS person.

127
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,340
But I'll do my best.

128
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,440
We'll see how this goes.

129
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,860
The story isn't that important.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
The only thing you have to remember is that all of Skippity Toilet is 100% canon.

131
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,340
Yeah!

132
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,000
Skippity Toilet is also this!

133
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,460
Oh my god.

134
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm trying to get in the young crowd.

135
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,420
To watch my streams.

136
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,580
Now we need you to play Halo.

137
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,840
I do want to play Halo eventually.

138
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,820
Dr. Gravity, thank you for the hot guy sample!

139
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,700
I love Half-Life.

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,320
One of my favorites of all time.

141
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Playing Half-Life and not Black Mesa is like playing Twin Snakes instead of MGS1.

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,400
That's why I'm playing the original Half-Life and not Black Mesa.

143
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,260
Because I did see some people being like...

144
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,080
Why isn't she playing Black Mesa instead?

145
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,740
Isn't it like the remake of the first one?

146
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,060
But I was like...

147
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,320
Well, you know...

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,820
I wanna at least play Half-Life and Half-Life 2.

149
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,580
I know there's like some other...

150
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,040
Other games in between and everything.

151
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,940
Not extensions.

152
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,020
Expansions and stuff and stuff.

153
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah, I do kind of...

154
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,840
Putting it...

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,260
When you put it in Metal Gear terms, I understand completely.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,700
FPS.

157
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,640
Mint Phantoms per second.

158
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,940
The series is arguably the MGS of FPS games.

159
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,260
So I hope you appreciate it.

160
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,180
That?

161
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,480
Okay.

162
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,240
Okay, arguably.

163
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,740
Arguably.

164
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Weird comparison.

165
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,980
No, it's not.

166
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,500
This is a...

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm curious why there's no sound on the menu.

168
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,480
That was a...

169
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
Controversial take, maybe.

170
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,080
Who's making that argument?

171
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,380
Have fun!

172
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,240
Enjoy the bongs.

173
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,940
Half-Life uses purely environmental storytelling.

174
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,340
So listen to the dialogues and explore.

175
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,260
Turn off the updated models for the OG experience.

176
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,420
I don't...

177
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,100
I don't know if I have them on or...

178
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,660
I don't...

179
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't know if I have them on or...

180
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,660
I don't know if I have them on or not.

181
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,600
But we should...

182
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,400
Get into it.

183
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,000
The screenshot sound...

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,940
When you pressed up on the menu freaked me out.

185
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,920
Can you guys hear anything?

186
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,900
I can't.

187
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,980
Let's just...

188
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,080
There we go.

189
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Select difficulty.

190
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,120
Is this game hard?

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,800
It's old, so I assume it's really difficult.

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,760
Wait, should I go to the training room?

193
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,840
Maybe?

194
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,980
No.

195
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,940
It has hard parts.

196
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,680
Hard mode is really hard.

197
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,940
Easy.

198
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,180
Set medium.

199
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,160
Medium, I imagine, is like normal, right?

200
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,540
Play training.

201
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,980
Okay, let's try the training room.

202
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,340
Not the Steam logo.

203
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,860
Why is it so...

204
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,400
Minky, Minky, Minky...

205
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,100
Minky, Minky, Minky...

206
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,520
Minky, Minky, Minky...

207
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,820
Minky, Minky, Minky...

208
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,520
Minky, Minky, Minky...

209
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,220
Anonymous!

210
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,320
Thank you!

211
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,160
Have fun!

212
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,600
Telling someone to play Black Mesa first is like...

213
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
Telling someone to play...

214
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
Telling someone to play...

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,980
You guys have a hive mind.

216
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,320
MP3 volume!

217
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,300
Let's turn this down a little bit.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,180
Hopefully that changes it.

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Who copied me?

220
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,200
That's funny.

221
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,280
Do you think that's okay?

222
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
There's a man!

223
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,120
Okay!

224
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,660
Thank you!

225
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,500
Hold on, I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.

226
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,580
Thank you!

227
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Let's turn it down to like...

228
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Here.

229
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,640
I don't know what the suit volume is.

230
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,280
I feel like the game is loud in general.

231
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,160
Lady in a suit.

232
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,880
Let's go!

233
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,040
God!

234
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Oh my god!

235
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,840
We are so fast!

236
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,680
I'm gonna get motion sick.

237
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,140
Hello lady.

238
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Oh my suit!

239
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,340
Oh I got my suit on!

240
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,100
Oh I'm still alive!

241
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
To use your key press A button.

242
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,840
I'm pressing.

243
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,880
Let's begin by stepping into your suit.

244
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,260
You can see it suspended up ahead of you.

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,080
If you see one of these buttons, press it.

246
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,080
And I will appear to demonstrate certain moves.

247
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
She got that Laura Croft build.

248
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
How's the volume now?

249
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,340
Oh.

250
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,880
Sounds good.

251
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm inside her.

252
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,040
We are so fast!

253
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,720
Holy cow!

254
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,080
Here we go.

255
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,600
Ew,

256
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,220
we got the nerds watching.

257
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,020
Why is she red like that?

258
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,900
She's a hologram!

259
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,060
lol

260
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,780
Holy cow!

261
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,200
Stealth mode.

262
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,620
I keep hearing hebsuit instead of hevesuit.

263
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Why are they...

264
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,020
What are you doing up there?

265
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,880
You stinking nerd!

266
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Come down here and talk to me.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,820
Like a man!

268
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,270
Okay.

269
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,690
Thank you!

270
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,190
What is...oh so then there is also...

271
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,930
Like...

272
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,470
Run automatically and then this is like...

273
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,150
Not...okay.

274
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,390
Ho!

275
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,030
I'm gaming!

276
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,310
I'm gaming!

277
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,050
Crouch mid-jump will allow you to reach places easier.

278
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,450
Like that.

279
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,290
To get into these pipes...

280
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,370
You will have to signal your suit...

281
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,410
To make a duck jump.

282
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,270
You'll want to stand right at the mouth of the pipe...

283
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,350
And continue to press forward.

284
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,810
She's still talking.

285
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,850
Yeah, yeah lady.

286
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,970
I'm a gamer.

287
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,590
Thank you mom.

288
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,070
A duck jump.

289
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,650
Wait, what is this?

290
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,330
Kind of ominous, no?

291
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,050
This is part of the training.

292
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,730
I can't tell if the game is glitching...

293
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,630
Or if her hologram is getting worse.

294
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,550
I can't tell if it's because it's an old game...

295
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,350
Or if it's...

296
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,010
I don't know.

297
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,950
Yes.

298
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,750
What's over there though?

299
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,210
Wait, but what's this way?

300
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,410
And...

301
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,730
That's where I was?

302
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,270
Ah, ok.

303
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,170
Yeah, what if I can't?

304
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,110
Lady.

305
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,930
Sarah, welcome to my worship.

306
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,470
Thank you.

307
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,350
Thanks for the 5 gift dude!

308
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,830
What was that?

309
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,610
Oh my gosh.

310
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,970
Yo, I'm a gamer!

311
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,110
Yes.

312
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,390
Ok.

313
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,370
Is that what I look like?

314
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,950
Wait ma'am, can you do it again?

315
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,370
Pressing...

316
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,690
Wait, hold on.

317
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,770
Can you do it one more time?

318
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,780
That's what I look like.

319
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,700
Oh, I gotta get the jetpack.

320
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Oh, I'm so fast.

321
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Holy mo...

322
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,580
Oh.

323
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,480
Oopsie.

324
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,260
Wait, so what's it?

325
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,380
I gotta...

326
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Charge it?

327
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
She said?

328
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,960
Duck then jump.

329
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,920
Crouch.

330
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,340
Forward.

331
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,480
Jump.

332
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,230
Oh!

333
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,110
I don't...

334
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,530
I don't think I did it in the correct order though.

335
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,030
Oops!

336
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,050
Just kidding.

337
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,330
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,850
Save to see you playing this.

339
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,830
My recommended play order is Half-Life 1.

340
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,390
And expansion is Half-Life 2.

341
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,370
Wait, hold on.

342
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,550
And expansion is Half-Life 2.

343
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,790
And episode is Portal, Portal to Alex.

344
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,830
Oh, Alex is the...

345
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,570
The VR one, no?

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,040
Hmm.

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,740
VR.

348
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,800
Maybe I could, maybe once I get my...

349
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,140
Maybe I could do that with like a 3D setup.

350
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,940
You know?

351
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,300
Good morning mint day!

352
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,720
Today is my birthday!

353
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,840
So I'm spending on things like...

354
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,960
Things I like, like mintos.

355
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,820
Is there a cafe mate?

356
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,100
Can I order some mint cake?

357
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,740
With a slice of maid-o-magic and a coffee, please.

358
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,460
Do you know, kiddo?

359
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,420
Happy birthday!

360
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,940
Happy birthday to you!

361
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,260
Happy birthday to you!

362
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,320
Happy birthday, DnL Kero!

363
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,860
Here is your moe-moe-kyun!

364
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,300
Maid-o-magic!

365
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,140
Happy birthday to you!

366
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,660
Happy birthday!

367
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,100
Thanks for the donate!

368
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,300
No!

369
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,620
Oh!

370
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,780
That's what...

371
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,260
You guys are liars!

372
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,860
This is where I was going, not where I was!

373
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,080
Press backwards key.

374
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,400
Oh, I see.

375
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,640
Oh, gosh.

376
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,680
Okay.

377
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,660
What's the use key?

378
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,300
What's the use key?

379
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,260
Don't forget to watch full life consequences.

380
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,900
Yeah, I know that one.

381
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,300
Why is there blood back there?

382
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,260
Wait a second.

383
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,660
I think this is kind of important.

384
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,220
Okay, I pressed E before you guys even said it.

385
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,080
Oh, there is like hand print on the wall.

386
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,920
This doesn't seem...

387
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,840
Make me healthy!

388
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,960
Gorgeous freedom.

389
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
I just turned 46.

390
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,440
Could you mean to beat me in the dust?

391
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,680
Wait, does that mean it's your birthday?

392
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,120
Or fragile?

393
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,280
Sorry, my voice is kind of icky today though.

394
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,180
You will find medkits like this one throughout the Black Mesa compound.

395
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,720
To restore your health, walk up to a medkit and press your use key.

396
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,480
Your health will recover gradually until you are at full health or the kit is depleted.

397
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,240
Once the light goes out, a medkit cannot be reused.

398
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:11,660
Since my voice is kind of messed up a little bit, I might not be able to do happy birthday songs.

399
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,460
I'll stop after the kitties one.

400
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,300
But for now, I'm sorry I won't be able to do them for probably the next couple of days.

401
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,120
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

402
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,300
But Arkham Jack, happy birthday to you!

403
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,020
Happy birthday to you!

404
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,160
Happy birthday, Arkham Jack!

405
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,860
Happy birthday to you!

406
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,660
Oh, Hanta!

407
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you for the raid!

408
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,420
I'm about to sing happy birthday.

409
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,360
Wait, you sent for a story about my cats.

410
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
My cats...

411
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,060
My cat!

412
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,220
Thank you for the gift!

413
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,040
Paperbox, thanks for the five gifted!

414
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,080
My cat!

415
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
What did she do?

416
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
What did she do today?

417
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,240
That's kind of funny.

418
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,560
Thank you, CF2!

419
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,200
Thanks for the gifted!

420
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,360
Did I miss one?

421
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,860
I feel like I missed one.

422
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,400
Oh, Dorgo!

423
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:26,960
Sorry!

424
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
Thank you for the five gifted!

425
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,880
Bugbug!

426
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,720
Thanks for the gifted!

427
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Ducky!

428
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,220
Thanks for the gifted!

429
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,760
Sound is so nostalgic, isn't it?

430
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,140
Old.

431
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,020
Why is there a health thing here?

432
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm spinning.

433
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,740
I think it's timed.

434
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,180
Uh oh.

435
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,560
Wait.

436
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,620
Thanks.

437
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm pretty good.

438
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,540
Probably.

439
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,700
In case you fall.

440
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,160
What's over here?

441
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,760
Anything?

442
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,520
I keep feeling like there is going to be something secret to explore in this area.

443
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:27,740
No?

444
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,780
Push that box down into the pit.

445
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,120
Pushing is easy.

446
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,400
What was that?

447
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,020
No training only?

448
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
We got bugs in here!

449
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,080
If you can't push the obstacle out of your way, you might try pulling it.

450
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,600
To pull a box, move up to it and press your use key.

451
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,780
While holding down the use key to keep a grip on the box, move slowly backward.

452
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,920
The box will come along with you.

453
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Thank you!

454
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,440
Cool gaming game.

455
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,960
Maybe check out Half-Life VR.

456
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,580
But the AI is self-aware whenever you have time.

457
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,040
I will!

458
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,740
Thank you!

459
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
I'll try to remember.

460
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,160
Get in the box.

461
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,540
Oh no, we have puzzles now.

462
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,520
Oh gosh, I'm not very...

463
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,460
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

464
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,210
What am I?

465
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,170
Pest control here?

466
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,990
Can I get this one too?

467
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,730
Oh, wait.

468
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,130
I think I did.

469
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,190
Mata, no!

470
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,890
Mata, yes!

471
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,830
Oh gosh, this is so...

472
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,990
This is so tricky.

473
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,200
I always start on you singing happy birthday to someone.

474
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,340
There's a lot of birthdays going on.

475
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,400
You can try breaking the objects in your path.

476
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,740
Make sure you picked up the crowbar.

477
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,440
Then simply smash your way through the debris.

478
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,240
Yeah!

479
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,500
We got it!

480
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,200
Ew,

481
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,720
there's more bugs in there.

482
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,040
I think we have to...ok, break, crouch and break.

483
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,170
We have so much power now.

484
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,610
Activate your suit flashlight for the next area.

485
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,180
Fifteen percent.

486
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
Ew, this is scary.

487
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,560
Oh, this is really scary.

488
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,320
Oh, I don't like this.

489
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,340
Is this a horror game?

490
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,700
Ok.

491
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,540
Is this truly an FPS when all I need is the crowbar?

492
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,840
Oh, loading.

493
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,940
Yes.

494
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,680
Oh, what is this?

495
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,660
Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff.

496
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,380
Oh, I don't think I can take anymore.

497
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:00,840
Ok.

498
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,680
What a coincidence.

499
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,340
I played Black Mesa last week.

500
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,480
The flashlight recharges if you turn it off for a while.

501
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,100
Oh, that's good.

502
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,940
That's good to know.

503
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,340
Ah yes, your average science based training for a big corporation.

504
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,280
Of course!

505
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,780
What could go wrong?

506
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,040
How do you...

507
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
To fire your grenade launcher, use your alternate fire button.

508
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,780
Certain targets will break only when hit by grenades.

509
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,500
Commencing sequence in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

510
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,640
Sorry.

511
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,220
Wait, hold on.

512
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,660
Scared the heck out of me.

513
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,940
Who

514
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,650
am I killing?

515
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:02,970
Oh.

516
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,540
I'm not doing a very good job with...

517
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,320
Oh, breakable.

518
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm not doing a very good job hitting these guys, but...

519
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,900
In the neck.

520
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,820
In the shoulder.

521
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,620
Unbreakable?

522
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,060
Wait, if it's unbreakable...

523
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,360
In her mouth!

524
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
Over the glass?

525
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,320
Oh!

526
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
I see, I see, I see.

527
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,720
Give your cats kisses for me instead.

528
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,680
Thank you kitties!

529
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,400
Happy birthday!

530
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,160
Sorry, I forgot about...

531
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,800
Hold on.

532
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,540
What did you say?

533
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,100
Uh oh.

534
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,440
It sounds like that was important.

535
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm so sorry.

536
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,720
I forgot about a story about my cat.

537
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,500
She recognizes the sound...

538
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,780
Well, no.

539
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,000
She's just a silly goose.

540
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,460
She was really needy today.

541
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,020
And she was making all sorts of chirps and everything.

542
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,420
Ouch.

543
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,920
What?

544
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
Was I supposed to land in the water?

545
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,380
What are you doing?

546
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,900
Swim on to the end of the course?

547
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,440
Oh, okay.

548
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,020
What were the controls again?

549
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,560
Oh.

550
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,700
Alright.

551
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
Easy enough.

552
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,180
You managed to avoid drowning.

553
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,180
Crazy how fast the load times are nowadays.

554
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,830
Nice.

555
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,170
Nice.

556
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,690
It's a lot of water down there.

557
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,430
Certain types of damage will register on your heads up display.

558
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,490
Direction of damage indicator.

559
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:06,550
Ouch.

560
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,610
Ouchy ouch.

561
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,170
We probably shouldn't touch that.

562
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:24,630
Oh god.

563
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,910
Can I heal?

564
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,750
I think I'm gonna die.

565
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,850
This is quite the tutorial.

566
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,510
It's so long.

567
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,850
Mint doesn't need to hear all this.

568
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,870
She's highly trained professional.

569
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,170
Yeah, everyone's been saying that.

570
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,030
I know it's probably part of the game, but it's making me feel good.

571
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,670
A man!

572
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,090
A lady security guard intervenes in your system.

573
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,020
You must approach a guard and press your use key.

574
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,980
He will follow you until you face him and press the use key again.

575
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,940
What do I do?

576
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,840
Restart.

577
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,500
For those coming into the stream, death count is 52.

578
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,560
What are you talking about?

579
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:34,600
Ah.

580
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,760
I didn't know if he was a bad guy or not.

581
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,090
He's probably fine right now.

582
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,350
Just kill me!

583
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,010
Kill me!!!

584
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,850
He will let you back into the transit system.

585
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,990
You must approach a guard and press your use key.

586
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,270
He will follow you until you face him and press the use key again.

587
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,490
He will let you back into the transit system.

588
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,030
You must approach a guard and press your use key.

589
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,970
He will follow you until you face him and press the use key again.

590
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,150
He will let you back into the transit system.

591
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,750
He will let you back into the transit system.

592
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,290
You must approach a guard and press your use key.

593
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,210
He will follow you until you face him and press the use key again.

594
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,720
Let's see, load...auto.

595
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,840
This is not a hot dog moment.

596
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,250
This is a first for me.

597
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,250
Impressive.

598
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,690
I guess we'll give it a go.

599
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,150
I think it's going to be the same, no?

600
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,700
You finished the tutorial.

601
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,240
Yeah!

602
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,080
We finished the tutorial.

603
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,560
You guys, I think we're fine.

604
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,240
I think I know everything that I need to know.

605
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,000
I think we're good, right?

606
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,340
Let's go play Half-Life.

607
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
New Mexico!

608
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
Early.

609
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,840
Oh, look.

610
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,180
The tutorial finished you.

611
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,420
I hope you enjoyed that.

612
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,420
Hello, Gordon.

613
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,760
This is so cool.

614
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,300
I feel like I'm in a theme park.

615
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,540
Can I leave this thing?

616
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,260
Oh god, I'm stuck.

617
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,860
This machine does not follow the laws of physics.

618
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,900
I'm in motion.

619
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,440
I shouldn't be flying backwards.

620
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,200
How are we going down?

621
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,540
Whoa, whoa.

622
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,740
That guy is running.

623
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,820
They haven't invented the laws of physics, so chill.

624
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,040
Let's go!

625
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,020
Hide me.

626
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,300
You guys are so broke bro.

627
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,070
No, you guys brought it up first.

628
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,850
I was thinking it's just a little elevator.

629
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,950
That's me.

630
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,270
He's only 27?

631
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,570
He looks like he's 35.

632
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,590
Wow.

633
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,070
What's that?

634
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,610
It's so cute.

635
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,030
Oh my god.

636
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,870
I love robots.

637
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,370
Oh.

638
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,010
This is so cool.

639
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,730
This world building is so fun.

640
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,830
Oh my gosh.

641
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,670
This is so fun.

642
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,550
Yeah, we know.

643
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,410
This is so cool.

644
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,210
Cool.

645
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,410
Feels really...oh we are going down.

646
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,730
We are going down, down.

647
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,390
Watch out!

648
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,970
That guy!

649
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,490
Oh!

650
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,970
Is he going in there?

651
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,790
Too bad.

652
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,730
I think this is our stop.

653
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,990
Exciting!

654
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,850
Ok.

655
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,110
Ok.

656
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:33,350
I think I'm naked.

657
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,730
I don't think I...

658
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,110
Well, this thing was so slow and all the robots were in my way.

659
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,290
The world building in this game is incredible.

660
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,950
Hello sir.

661
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,570
Here, I'll walk with you.

662
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,110
Can we do this later?

663
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,010
Hey, catch me later.

664
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:08,750
I'll buy you a beer.

665
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,910
Let me in!

666
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,170
Nerd MintoQ?

667
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,490
Did you just say nerd?

668
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,950
We love Barney.

669
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,550
Is that his name?

670
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,670
Oh god.

671
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,730
Barney's teeth are like kind of...

672
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:41,530
Ok.

673
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:42,330
Bye bye!

674
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,270
Every guard is Barney.

675
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,810
Anomalous materials.

676
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,010
Really wanted to take the time to flex.

677
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,350
Cutting edge hardware.

678
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,690
Yeah, this whole intro sequence was incredible for 1998.

679
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,750
Yeah, I mean...

680
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:09,960
Hello.

681
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,550
Ok.

682
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:27,710
What are you doing?

683
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,990
Oh dang, I'm really late.

684
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,930
Use his keyboard, can you?

685
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:44,790
Sorry.

686
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,270
What's this do?

687
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,110
Just one of those days.

688
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,310
Sorry.

689
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,470
Wow, you can interact with everything!

690
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,130
Wouldn't it be fantastic to get some pure readings for a change?

691
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,370
I have no doubt.

692
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,510
Well, not everything.

693
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:19,310
What about you?

694
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:24,910
Shut up.

695
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,730
Why did you say that?

696
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,190
He just looked over and said shut up at me.

697
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,170
Are you running those tunneling lattice calculations again?

698
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,230
Shut up.

699
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,570
They are so sassy.

700
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,030
Oh my god, no wonder you have...

701
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,830
No wonder you look like that.

702
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,150
He stressed his hair off.

703
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,010
Paul, look at your hairline.

704
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,670
What about you?

705
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:07,770
You like me, right?

706
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,010
Ok, let's go.

707
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,670
So rude, I know.

708
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,410
Oh, hello.

709
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,090
I just...

710
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,310
I was saying hi!

711
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:30,110
I think this is about how the graphics and tech have changed.

712
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,970
It will be in 6 years, Half-Life 2.

713
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,530
I just love that with old games.

714
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,390
Oh, hello.

715
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:38,710
Someone nice.

716
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:42,370
Oh, ok.

717
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,210
Bye bye.

718
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,110
Ah, hello Gordon Freeman.

719
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,630
Oh, ok.

720
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,430
You are so busy shimmying on me.

721
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,220
That looks important in there.

722
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,740
Mr. Business Suit.

723
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,780
I don't know which way I'm actually supposed to go.

724
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,100
Keep looking.

725
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,600
Things do not look like they are going well.

726
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,960
Santiago, welcome to the membership.

727
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,660
Thank you.

728
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,460
The power stance.

729
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,580
Is he going to kill him?

730
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,250
He looked at us, didn't he?

731
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,210
Wait, I didn't see him look at me.

732
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:55,850
Evening Freeman.

733
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,190
Sorry, I missed it.

734
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,110
You saw it?

735
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,910
Ok, I'll go back in the vault and see it.

736
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,240
I'm knocking on the window.

737
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,260
What are these guys doing?

738
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,280
Eggs.

739
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,180
Oh, hello.

740
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,000
Periodic table.

741
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,620
They are a hive mind.

742
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,600
Hello Gordon Freeman, things are rather busy today.

743
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,080
Stop, please.

744
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,320
I'm so embarrassed.

745
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,580
Oh, there is another guy.

746
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,360
Wait, what do they look like?

747
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,880
They are a pretty average tie, no?

748
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,180
Kind of crazy how... wait, what?

749
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:58,960
Oh, sorry.

750
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,260
How Half-Life captures my work day.

751
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,080
Why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?

752
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,700
They look fine to me.

753
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,100
Oh, wait.

754
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:18,730
Wow,

755
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,130
it took you a second.

756
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,450
We can go... coolant reserve facility.

757
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,050
I don't think this is where I need to go, right?

758
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,330
Why not?

759
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:39,970
Ok, Barney.

760
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,570
Yeah, I'm holding you to that.

761
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,370
What a good day today.

762
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,530
It is.

763
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,570
I have a feeling things are gonna be...

764
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,690
Oh, there is a stomper over here.

765
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,770
I'm watching Mint with the science team.

766
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,330
I have a feeling today is gonna be the greatest day ever.

767
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:08,290
Ok.

768
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:10,710
Straighten him up.

769
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,770
Stop, stop, stop.

770
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:21,990
All the scientists in the test chamber are waiting for Gordon Chan to get us.

771
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,050
Yes!

772
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:27,710
Ok,

773
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,310
I gotta go get my hazard suit.

774
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,410
I gotta suit up.

775
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,810
That looks like a suiting up area.

776
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,010
What's in here?

777
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,710
Oh, this also looks like...

778
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,890
I like how they repeat your name over and over and over again.

779
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:50,530
Oh look!

780
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,610
Are these not the people that...the devs?

781
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,170
Are these not the devs?

782
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,830
This is...this is my locker.

783
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,330
I'm a cow and this is a cheese colored super burrito.

784
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,750
Thanks cow!

785
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,570
Why is my locker there?

786
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,780
Oh, uh oh.

787
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,210
I see somebody in there.

788
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,330
Hey!

789
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,630
Coomer is the name of that scientist, not model.

790
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,910
Uh oh.

791
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,370
Oh, well let me in.

792
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:54,810
Is somebody in there?

793
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,710
Oh, it's a book.

794
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,770
Who is talking while they are taking a shit?

795
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,510
I just can't stop it.

796
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,450
They are so loud.

797
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,510
Hold on, I want to see what the other area was too.

798
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,050
Is this the ladies room?

799
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,050
Oh, this is the break room.

800
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:22,630
Sorry.

801
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,180
Give me my drink.

802
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,540
I'm getting scammed.

803
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:38,380
Hello?

804
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,360
Soda, soda pop.

805
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,700
My god, what are you doing?

806
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,740
He is on his break.

807
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,580
Alright, let's go suit up.

808
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,740
Soda, soda pop.

809
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,240
Yeah, I saw these names in the...oh there is me!

810
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,820
In the...

811
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,020
I have a baby?

812
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,860
The orchid eater?

813
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,260
And the...

814
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,560
The 37th mandala.

815
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,680
I have a kid?

816
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,180
Wow, my kid.

817
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,700
He's got a full head of hair.

818
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,900
I am the kid.

819
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,240
I'm so fast, sometimes it's hard to...

820
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,940
Hold on.

821
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:10,990
Hold on.

822
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,370
The barrel.

823
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,900
Hello?

824
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,140
Oh, there we go.

825
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,540
Technology!

826
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,890
Oh, there is the helicopter.

827
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:50,450
Wow!

828
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,950
Technology, working as a team.

829
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,270
I saw all three of those guys today.

830
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,950
PowerPoint animation.

831
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,370
Safety!

832
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:00,990
Yeah!

833
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,230
What else we got?

834
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,430
Black Mesa.

835
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,410
I like this one.

836
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,970
Security force.

837
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:11,570
The dam.

838
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,390
I'm so fast.

839
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,930
Well,

840
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,600
damn.

841
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:27,720
Damn.

842
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,480
Another day, another dollar.

843
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,340
Gosh, it's hard work being me.

844
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,240
What's down here?

845
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,020
Oops.

846
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,840
We're fine.

847
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,360
We're fine.

848
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,950
I could have just taken that.

849
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,030
But seriously, what is down there?

850
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,070
Maintenance access.

851
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,150
Oh, oh.

852
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,060
You're dying in places I didn't know were possible.

853
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,420
You can check.

854
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,160
Nothing yet?

855
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,180
Ok, we won't deal with it yet then.

856
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,120
Hello.

857
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,300
Fairy?

858
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,420
Fairy?

859
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,700
Thanks for all the superchats you guys.

860
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,700
You may find out.

861
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:05,900
Oh, theory.

862
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,520
Who can say?

863
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,740
Oh, this guy is so guilty.

864
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,060
You ate all the donuts.

865
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,320
You!

866
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,160
Control room, test lab access, plasma cells, ionization chambers.

867
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,960
Hello, scientist man.

868
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,380
Laser tubes.

869
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,540
Ok, cool.

870
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,120
Hi.

871
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm going in.

872
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,580
Caution laser, caution laser.

873
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,080
Oh, control room.

874
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,300
Test chamber.

875
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,660
They're waiting for you, Gordon.

876
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,000
In the test chamber.

877
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,360
They're waiting for you, Gordon.

878
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,660
In the chest.

879
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,840
Access denied.

880
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,900
Oh, come on.

881
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,140
How is every line so iconic?

882
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:43,780
Uh oh.

883
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,720
That doesn't seem good.

884
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:52,860
Uh oh.

885
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,580
Should I go in there or...

886
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,460
Finally the next test subject.

887
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,230
I can fix it.

888
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,850
I can fix it.

889
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,350
This doesn't seem very good.

890
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,430
Am I going to be ok?

891
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:21,650
Wait.

892
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:24,450
There we go.

893
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:29,370
Wow, what a cool elevator.

894
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,150
A new man.

895
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:42,150
If it's beneath the surface of the earth, OSHA can't see it, so it's legal.

896
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:43,210
So true.

897
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:49,210
He said the test results seemed fine, but our machinery is literally blowing up.

898
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,490
Is there subtitles?

899
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,130
Gaben.

900
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,230
Thank you.

901
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:41,830
Thank you.

902
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,830
Thank you.

903
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,010
Ok, hold on.

904
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,970
I saw something.

905
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,430
It's my birthday.

906
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,170
I would like to inquire as to what birthday service is...

907
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,710
Random person, happy birthday!

908
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,190
Usually I could sing you a song, but not today.

909
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:06,830
I could give you a moe moe energy beam for your cake.

910
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,410
Moe moe beam!

911
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,070
Oh god my throat.

912
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,210
One more time.

913
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,510
Moe moe beam!

914
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:18,710
There you go.

915
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,970
What is that?

916
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,030
Am I going in the cage?

917
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,510
Oh shoot, I went in the cage.

918
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,890
Wait.

919
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,940
Damn, I don't think I can get in.

920
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,140
Am I going in...

921
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,060
Everything seems to be in order.

922
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:10,250
Hope you do new save often to avoid death loop.

923
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,490
I didn't know that was a thing.

924
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,430
I will do that.

925
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,470
F6 is a good...

926
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,070
Wait, is it F5 or F6?

927
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,930
I'll try F5.

928
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:34,430
F6?

929
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,150
Ok, it's not F5 you guys.

930
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,030
It's F6!

931
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,710
Everybody is saying F5, but it's F6.

932
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,170
It's Alt F4.

933
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,770
What's happening?

934
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,490
F7 is quick load.

935
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,390
Thank you.

936
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,370
3, 2, 1

937
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,650
Caution laser

938
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:29,290
Oh my house!

939
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,800
I'm sure it will kill you if you go back in.

940
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,040
Try out the quick load.

941
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,380
Wow, it worked!

942
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,920
Good to know.

943
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,300
I guess I won't go into the beam.

944
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,520
Don't go into the light, Mito!

945
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,060
I won't.

946
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,480
Ok, I won't.

947
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,920
I'm going to balance on this beam.

948
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,080
It's so beautiful, right?

949
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,180
I was just curious.

950
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,320
I just wanted to see what was going on in there.

951
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:03,730
What am I doing?

952
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,610
Do I push this?

953
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,850
Do I press this?

954
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,390
No.

955
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,730
Just vibe.

956
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:22,930
Ok.

957
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:35,410
I see it.

958
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,710
I'm pushing.

959
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,000
I think I messed up.

960
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,420
I didn't mess up.

961
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,040
That wasn't me.

962
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,480
Is there a door I can leave?

963
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,440
I had one job!

964
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,560
Thank you for the pick.

965
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,850
I'm not a scientist.

966
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,030
Wow, lizards!

967
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,650
They are so cute!

968
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,870
Little bugs.

969
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,130
Unforeseen consequences.

970
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:50,530
What is this?

971
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:58,970
I like how

972
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,340
the things are bouncing around.

973
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,620
Oh no!

974
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,000
Mr. Man!

975
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:08,420
Are you ok?

976
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,220
You alright?

977
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,000
You got this.

978
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,880
I'll give him mouth to mouth.

979
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,440
I don't think this guy made it though.

980
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,160
It's suddenly so spooky.

981
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,270
What did you do?

982
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,170
I didn't mean to.

983
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:05,770
I just thought that it was a really pretty stone.

984
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,830
Everything is fine up here though.

985
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,290
Everybody is fine here.

986
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,570
Hello guys.

987
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,450
I mean mouth to mouth.

988
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:41,250
OK!

989
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,030
Oh my god!

990
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,310
Wait!

991
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:47,670
Is that a headcrab?

992
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,710
This is the professional mint phantom.

993
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,030
Look how cute it is!

994
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:57,690
I saw it earlier.

995
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:07,030
It's so cute.

996
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,410
It's trying to eat me.

997
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,750
Hello!

998
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:29,270
Press E to recruit?

999
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,630
I see, I see.

1000
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,250
Come, come, come.

1001
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,310
Quick save.

1002
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:47,230
Saved.

1003
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,850
Are you ok?

1004
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,120
That doesn't seem good.

1005
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,640
That doesn't seem to...Oh no it's a headcrab.

1006
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,700
He's coming for me!

1007
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,460
I'm running!

1008
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,540
Wait, can I get through there?

1009
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:20,820
OK.

1010
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:21,820
Alright, cool.

1011
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,700
Everything kinda gone to shit you guys.

1012
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,740
Open up!

1013
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Oh my god!

1014
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:38,960
I got him!

1015
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,360
There we go.

1016
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:48,900
Nice.

1017
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,900
Crowbar baby!

1018
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,800
Oh sorry!

1019
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,480
Oops!

1020
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,360
My bad.

1021
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,440
Are you ok down

1022
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,320
there?

1023
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,400
Hold on.

1024
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,470
OK, hold on.

1025
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,750
This is how I learn how to use the ladder.

1026
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,870
There we go.

1027
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,330
Oh see?

1028
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,630
There is a battery pack.

1029
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,990
Where is the guy though?

1030
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:46,790
Wait, what's this?

1031
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,870
Looks like just a piece.

1032
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:01,370
Go.

1033
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:13,110
Oh there is more?

1034
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:19,670
That look nice.

1035
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:20,470
You wanna team up?

1036
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,830
Yeah!

1037
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:22,870
Woo!

1038
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,570
Half life source...what what?

1039
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,450
Crouch and hit the dead ones, yeah?

1040
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,300
That's crazy.

1041
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,940
That's so crazy.

1042
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:42,960
Come on buddy.

1043
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,560
There is a lot of blood around here.

1044
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:48,980
Are you ok?

1045
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,750
Let's keep going.

1046
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,090
Let's keep going buddy.

1047
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,170
Is this thing gonna turn it...

1048
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,530
Is this thing gonna wake up?

1049
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,890
No?

1050
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:29,150
I think I was getting shot at, no?

1051
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:41,850
I got slapped.

1052
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,930
Oh no,

1053
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:52,210
the microwave.

1054
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,250
Is he mad about it?

1055
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,430
His food is still cooking.

1056
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:03,870
It's called half life because my life will be half of what it is and I'm mean though.

1057
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,370
Stop it.

1058
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:09,590
Stop it.

1059
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,110
Yeah!

1060
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,270
Soda for the whole team!

1061
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,960
Oh there they go.

1062
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:28,010
There were soda for the whole team.

1063
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,170
What are you doing over there?

1064
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:29,710
Are you scared?

1065
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,340
Anybody in here?

1066
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:34,340
Anything?

1067
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:38,800
Oh!

1068
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,260
Some bullets.

1069
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,420
That's the good stuff.

1070
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,720
Damn.

1071
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,720
Oh, I smell the bathroom.

1072
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:09,960
I think we should go.

1073
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,340
Wait, do any of these open though?

1074
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,640
I actually didn't check.

1075
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,840
Yeah Barney, that's poop.

1076
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:31,960
Oh!

1077
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,480
Another one.

1078
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:33,860
Let's go.

1079
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,540
Nice.

1080
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,260
My kid.

1081
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,820
Wait, there was... Oh this thing.

1082
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,220
My little canister fell down.

1083
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,360
Wow, the attention to detail is so crazy.

1084
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,360
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

1085
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,980
Is my buddy coming?

1086
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:53,940
Come on.

1087
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,040
What are you doing?

1088
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:56,560
Let's go.

1089
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:58,780
There you go.

1090
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,240
Come on.

1091
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,280
There you go.

1092
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,640
Little steps.

1093
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,340
Little steps.

1094
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:04,880
There you go.

1095
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,720
I heard something squashing.

1096
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,120
I got scared.

1097
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,220
I'm save scumming.

1098
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,720
Sorry.

1099
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,020
Sorry.

1100
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,440
Wait, it's gonna go after that guy.

1101
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,580
I killed it.

1102
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,040
Oh, I killed him too.

1103
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,280
It was self defense.

1104
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,160
Probably.

1105
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,230
I don't know who is infected and who is not.

1106
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:11,290
Right?

1107
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:14,050
Ai yai yai.

1108
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,050
Ai yai yai yai yai.

1109
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,210
Beep beep beep beep.

1110
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,090
Nothing works.

1111
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,750
OK, I leave.

1112
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,390
Don't go in there Barney.

1113
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:33,530
OK.

1114
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,130
I seem to have fixed it.

1115
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,310
Oh, that opened up a hole.

1116
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,150
OK, hold on.

1117
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,850
Before we go in there, let's go to the other side.

1118
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,390
Yeah, I saw...

1119
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,040
Oh, what the heck?

1120
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,460
What was that?

1121
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:03,120
OK, that was just showing us how to get through.

1122
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:04,920
Got it.

1123
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,320
Got it.

1124
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,260
Phantom does not need to hear this.

1125
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,740
She is a trade professional.

1126
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:11,900
Come here.

1127
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,200
Pspsps.

1128
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,340
Yeah.

1129
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,960
Everything is back to normal now.

1130
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:22,400
Exactly.

1131
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,680
I can report it here.

1132
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,300
Never mind.

1133
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,000
But he can't crawl through.

1134
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,780
He is a little silly.

1135
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,780
Uh oh.

1136
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:49,600
Uh oh.

1137
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,620
I just watched that happen.

1138
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:58,920
I was too late.

1139
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,680
I don't think it will let me in.

1140
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:23,070
This is kind of spooky you guys.

1141
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:23,690
I'm not going to lie.

1142
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,350
He is like, I'm just trying to watch anime.

1143
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,490
OK.

1144
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,570
Something is giving me a headache.

1145
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,140
Not the eggs.

1146
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:46,660
Oh my gosh!

1147
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:47,440
No, Coomer!

1148
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,720
No, Coomer!

1149
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,740
You were so young.

1150
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:55,840
Please let me out.

1151
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,080
There we go.

1152
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,060
Wait, are you alive?

1153
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,800
Oh no!

1154
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:14,480
No!

1155
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,060
He was almost there.

1156
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:18,960
He died.

1157
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,360
You were so good.

1158
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,740
How do I change between weapons?

1159
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:24,280
Oh, there we go.

1160
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,180
I'll kill it.

1161
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:28,980
I'll kill it dead.

1162
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,980
These things are really tough.

1163
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:39,050
Hello?

1164
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,030
Rescue?

1165
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,130
I see.

1166
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,790
Thank you.

1167
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:50,230
Thank you.

1168
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,430
Oh, I can crouch through here.

1169
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,770
That doesn't seem like a good sound.

1170
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,300
Oh, cute.

1171
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,080
Oh gosh!

1172
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,160
That's what that thing is doing.

1173
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:36,940
OK.

1174
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:37,460
Sheesh.

1175
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:45,190
Oh my god.

1176
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:57,830
He seems awfully calm for everything that's going on here.

1177
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,130
Is there like auto-aim on?

1178
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:05,210
It's freaking me out.

1179
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:08,330
Auto-aim is really getting to me.

1180
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,520
How do I turn it off?

1181
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,240
The options.

1182
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,160
Let's see.

1183
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,120
A keyboard.

1184
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:22,920
Oh, aim.

1185
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,120
Auto-aim.

1186
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,100
Yeah, let's not do that.

1187
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,780
Let's not have that.

1188
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,700
Is there like a reload I need to do?

1189
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,300
Oh, I could've pushed this.

1190
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,820
Uh-oh, I just pushed into a corner.

1191
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,080
I hope I didn't need that.

1192
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,520
So this area is death?

1193
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,880
Oh my gosh.

1194
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,760
OK, they weren't kidding.

1195
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,480
Oh, I hear another.

1196
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,800
I hear it.

1197
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,300
What am I hearing?

1198
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,280
What the heck is that?

1199
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,520
Oh my god.

1200
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,680
At least it dies easily.

1201
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,860
Holy cow.

1202
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,100
Good golly.

1203
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,580
OK, I don't know which way I want to go.

1204
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,540
I'm trying to figure it out.

1205
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,400
OK.

1206
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,220
I know I can get in through here though.

1207
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,400
Maybe I'm just bad.

1208
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,900
There we go.

1209
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,140
Let's go this way first.

1210
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,220
Oh my gosh!

1211
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,040
Scared the heck out of me.

1212
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,200
Can

1213
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,570
I please get out?

1214
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:41,670
Hello.

1215
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,420
Maybe I should've shot the...Oh, hello mister.

1216
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,140
Are you OK?

1217
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,440
Yes.

1218
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:03,720
Yup.

1219
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,240
Alright.

1220
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:08,540
Alright.

1221
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,380
Give me a second mister.

1222
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,420
Yeah, yeah.

1223
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,420
Give me a second.

1224
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,880
Oh shoot, he soft locked me.

1225
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:23,980
Wait, hold on.

1226
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:24,560
Can you move?

1227
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:24,920
Thank you.

1228
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:25,400
There we go.

1229
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,360
Let's go back.

1230
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,440
I think he's going to use...I'm going to need him to open a door over there.

1231
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:38,540
I'm assuming...I'm assuming...I just want to take a look around in here first.

1232
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,930
What I was saying is...

1233
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,370
That's so...

1234
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,660
I think I got him.

1235
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:10,210
Are you OK in there?

1236
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:16,430
Come on out.

1237
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:21,430
Oh, but you said let's go.

1238
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:24,410
OK.

1239
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,030
Freaking liar over here.

1240
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,850
OK.

1241
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:42,670
That seems more permanent than where we were headed before.

1242
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:43,710
So let's go back.

1243
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,450
Come on mister.

1244
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:53,510
OK.

1245
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:55,730
Don't go down yet.

1246
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:56,310
Yeah, I'm not.

1247
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:56,730
I'm not.

1248
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:59,910
You seem like I can blow them up.

1249
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,780
I'm scared to though.

1250
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:08,400
Nevermind.

1251
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,180
Look at him picking like a gorilla.

1252
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,820
All is safe.

1253
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,200
Oh, thank you.

1254
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:32,400
Oh.

1255
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,590
OK.

1256
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:41,650
Nice.

1257
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:41,970
Wait.

1258
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:45,020
So...

1259
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,090
Grenades is...OK.

1260
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,350
Crowbar, gun, grenade is 5.

1261
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:50,850
OK.

1262
01:29:59,050 --> 01:29:59,950
Oh, sorry.

1263
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,750
Wait.

1264
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:05,630
I never learned how to use the grenade.

1265
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:10,770
Yeah, but why is the crowbar gone?

1266
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,290
It won't select it.

1267
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,500
You can...click to select.

1268
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:29,840
Ah, I see.

1269
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,100
I see.

1270
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:30,400
I see.

1271
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,460
I right clicked before.

1272
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,640
It was my birthday yesterday.

1273
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,980
Instead of singing a song, can I get a YOLOLO?

1274
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,840
Also lighten the mood during this disaster.

1275
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:45,900
Fancy pants lizard!

1276
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:46,860
Happy birthday!

1277
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:48,220
YOLOLO!

1278
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:49,440
YOLOLO!

1279
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:51,800
OK, mister.

1280
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:52,800
I don't think I need you anymore.

1281
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:58,840
Just in case.

1282
01:30:58,940 --> 01:30:59,480
Oh, sorry.

1283
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,180
Everything is fine.

1284
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:01,860
That guy was dead.

1285
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:02,640
Don't worry about it.

1286
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,040
OK, bye.

1287
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,030
I'm going to stay here and wait for my colleagues.

1288
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,830
Yep, that's what I told you to do.

1289
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,910
And what about you?

1290
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:37,530
Stinky.

1291
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:51,650
This is pretty freaky, guys.

1292
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:52,330
Not gonna lie.

1293
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,170
My flashlight does not work there.

1294
01:31:57,450 --> 01:32:00,670
Why do we even have the sewers like this?

1295
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,810
That seems like it will raise the water.

1296
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:14,570
Don't forget to do a quick save.

1297
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,750
Yeah, thank you.

1298
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,010
Thanks for reminding me, guys.

1299
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:18,690
Appreciate it.

1300
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:21,890
Hello?

1301
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,410
Oh gosh.

1302
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,870
I can't...I can't see.

1303
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:37,890
I can't...I can't...I'm trying to...

1304
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:42,070
That was close.

1305
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:50,460
Einstein of the dumpster.

1306
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:51,820
What is your wisdom?

1307
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,760
Don't drink the green water.

1308
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,180
Are there bosses in this game and stuff?

1309
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,160
And more cheese.

1310
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,200
Thanks, Cal.

1311
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,520
Thank you.

1312
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,420
Are

1313
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,080
you OK?

1314
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,440
Oh no!

1315
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:47,260
That scared me.

1316
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,260
I think I missed my...

1317
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,940
I think I missed my stop.

1318
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:24,970
It won't come for me, will it?

1319
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:26,550
Wait,

1320
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,060
I think I'm in trouble, you guys.

1321
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,280
Wait, I think this is actually pretty bad.

1322
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:09,820
Rain

1323
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:16,930
of crabs!

1324
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,860
I thought there was just the two of them.

1325
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,800
Oh, the grenade.

1326
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,800
Yes, thank you.

1327
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,950
That didn't seem like I did that correctly.

1328
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:49,970
OK, hold on.

1329
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,530
Third time's the charm.

1330
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:03,250
Oh, you are so annoying.

1331
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:04,210
Shut up!

1332
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:09,270
Shut up!

1333
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:25,290
Oh, I could use these for getting up to the first aid.

1334
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:31,510
We'll just leave these little guys alone.

1335
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:35,930
They don't seem to be bothering anybody, you know?

1336
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:40,190
Oh, I might want that though, actually, now I think about it.

1337
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:40,830
OK, hold on.

1338
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,620
I have a lot of ammo.

1339
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,160
OK.

1340
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,310
Wait, is this big enough?

1341
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:02,570
Wait.

1342
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:05,930
No, I don't think I can... Wait.

1343
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,530
Is this tall enough?

1344
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,530
I don't think so.

1345
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:16,830
I think I

1346
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,720
messed...

1347
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,780
I can walk it.

1348
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,960
What do you mean I can walk it?

1349
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,580
It scared me.

1350
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,020
You can hold E.

1351
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:41,920
No, you can't.

1352
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,480
E and walk.

1353
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,380
I give up.

1354
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,920
Let's just hope for the best.

1355
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,200
OK.

1356
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,620
Logan, thank you so much for the time gift.

1357
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,340
Thank you!

1358
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,370
I

1359
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:34,430
think I fractured something.

1360
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:03,890
Understandable.

1361
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:13,550
OK.

1362
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:15,670
Very good.

1363
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,520
Wait, should I have gone down that first one, I wonder?

1364
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:32,670
Let's go.

1365
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:33,470
Let's go.

1366
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:36,470
Oh, that doesn't look...

1367
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:41,290
Oh my god, he just killed it.

1368
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,370
Yeah, kill the... Wait.

1369
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,370
Let's have him kill the headcrabs.

1370
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:45,210
Ouch.

1371
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,370
OK.

1372
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:57,400
I can jump across.

1373
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,220
Wait, I wanted him to...

1374
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:05,580
I wanted him to kill the other guys, but he noticed me.

1375
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,200
Got his ass.

1376
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,040
What the headcra...

1377
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,160
Look at him...

1378
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,580
What is that?

1379
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,460
That's not a headcrab.

1380
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,600
What is that thing?

1381
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,880
He killed this one at least.

1382
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,820
OK, I think I'm going to have to go down.

1383
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,560
I still don't remember... Hold on.

1384
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,680
I don't quite remember the...

1385
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:51,740
This one.

1386
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:55,220
Oh no.

1387
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:57,520
Nasty water.

1388
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,880
I think I messed up.

1389
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:03,970
What are you?

1390
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:08,970
I don't have the jetpack.

1391
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:09,770
Oh, you're right.

1392
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,390
Use your arms, Gordon.

1393
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,050
Oh wait, I'm using my arms.

1394
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:33,630
Oh

1395
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,740
my gosh, I thought it was a rope.

1396
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,080
That's so funny.

1397
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,980
That's so funny.

1398
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:02,590
We're OK.

1399
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,420
Oh my gosh, I see them now.

1400
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:16,920
Come here.

1401
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:25,150
Oh shoot, I did it again.

1402
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,600
Don't mind me.

1403
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:44,570
Wow.

1404
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:50,630
If he comes into a spinning... Oh, they're both spinning.

1405
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:57,130
You're spinning me right round, baby, right round.

1406
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,970
Wait.

1407
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:20,620
Well, I guess this one I can go on.

1408
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:29,400
We made it.

1409
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,660
Is there anything down here?

1410
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,380
Let me check.

1411
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:39,670
Crimson, thanks for the superchat.

1412
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:40,530
Thank you.

1413
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:45,410
Oh, I

1414
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:52,220
just realized there is another door there.

1415
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,340
My bad.

1416
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,340
You guys, sayonara!

1417
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,050
Is that mine?

1418
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:15,890
Wait, I don't think I can live without that.

1419
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:17,450
I think that's like my heart.

1420
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:28,200
I think we have big problems here.

1421
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:35,250
Let's see if this thing can heal us all the way up.

1422
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:39,550
Nah, just walk it off.

1423
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:47,210
We are growing a new heart as we speak.

1424
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:52,390
Wait, there is one over there.

1425
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:54,690
Wait, wait, wait.

1426
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:58,150
Ok, hold on, hold on.

1427
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,030
We can get back over still.

1428
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:01,570
Nice.

1429
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,850
No, we are not in such good of shape, but that's ok.

1430
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,710
It will stop eventually.

1431
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,130
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1432
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:37,620
Ok, I messed up.

1433
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:39,980
I messed up.

1434
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:47,220
We probably reek so bad.

1435
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:53,500
This water is... I mean, we probably have grown like three arms at this point from this water.

1436
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,270
Hello?

1437
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,350
Hello?

1438
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:03,970
Hello?

1439
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,300
Hello?

1440
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:14,440
Hello?

1441
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,460
Oh no, parkour.

1442
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,160
Parkour moment.

1443
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,700
Hi, hi.

1444
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:27,860
Quick save.

1445
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:35,340
I was debating because I kind of want to...

1446
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:43,020
I wanted to go back to my save where I had full health and didn't lose my heart.

1447
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:46,080
Do you know who ate all the donuts?

1448
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,920
Who knows?

1449
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:48,580
Who knows?

1450
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,500
First try.

1451
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:54,400
Gamer.

1452
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:04,690
Or gaming.

1453
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,980
It's quiet here.

1454
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,240
Too quiet.

1455
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,100
Ok.

1456
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,960
I'm going to get ambushed in here.

1457
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,740
There's going to be four invisible men.

1458
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,120
Ah!

1459
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,080
Office complex.

1460
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:42,180
Oh, there

1461
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:52,520
was a guy there.

1462
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,400
Oh, it just killed that thing.

1463
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:02,640
Nice.

1464
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:03,840
Kill that guy too.

1465
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,360
Ah, nice, nice, nice.

1466
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,880
I don't know what's going on there.

1467
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,420
Oh my god.

1468
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,380
Oh no!

1469
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:24,470
I think everything has gone to hell for real.

1470
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:28,830
What's that sound?

1471
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:29,690
Oh gosh.

1472
01:48:39,450 --> 01:48:41,190
Today was... Oh gosh, you guys.

1473
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:43,030
I was three days away from retirement.

1474
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:45,510
This was supposed to be my best day ever.

1475
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,050
Ewww!

1476
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:53,910
That guy over there seems fine.

1477
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:01,440
That guy over there seems normal.

1478
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:10,310
Are you ok?

1479
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:12,230
That's it?

1480
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:13,590
Ah, good to see you.

1481
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:27,910
Right.

1482
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:31,730
Looking at her still beating her on the floor.

1483
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:33,690
The suit AI minor fractured.

1484
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:36,610
Yes to you.

1485
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:38,650
Is everything ok?

1486
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:44,990
I thought you disappeared.

1487
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:48,870
I thought he was just a figment of my imagination.

1488
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,540
What?

1489
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:56,620
Oh my god!

1490
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,880
That was so stinking close.

1491
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,380
Holy cow!

1492
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,520
Yes sir!

1493
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,180
I'm going to get this so that you don't get...

1494
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:42,980
Very good!

1495
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,440
Oh snacks!

1496
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,600
In her mouth!

1497
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:53,100
You're fine.

1498
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:55,860
What?

1499
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,840
A ghost just opened that.

1500
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:07,130
We are free to advance.

1501
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:09,550
Come on.

1502
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:11,170
I think I need you to open this door.

1503
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:15,930
What do you mean?

1504
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:18,710
Oh wait, I need to go in through here.

1505
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:19,390
Ok, hold on.

1506
01:51:21,650 --> 01:51:22,430
Nose happy.

1507
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:23,670
Yeah, we turned off the...

1508
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:25,030
We turned it off.

1509
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:27,290
We turned off the power.

1510
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,100
The bed?

1511
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,520
Ok.

1512
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,600
This doesn't seem like I should go into the water.

1513
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,500
The room with the electricity.

1514
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,320
And the water.

1515
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:50,060
Ok.

1516
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,060
What's in here?

1517
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:52,680
Storage?

1518
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,360
This game is good with the jump scares.

1519
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:10,150
What is it doing?

1520
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:18,750
Oh, he's just making a mess in there.

1521
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:24,800
Take it.

1522
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,420
Take that.

1523
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,960
Oh, there's nothing in here.

1524
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,420
Wow, that was a waste of my time.

1525
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,720
You're wasting my time.

1526
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:40,220
Oh wait, I'm a liar.

1527
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:44,120
Hit his legs.

1528
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,320
Thank you.

1529
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,540
The roaches.

1530
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,320
Smash.

1531
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:57,320
I like destroying everything until it's completely dead.

1532
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,180
Uh oh, is this like a puzzle?

1533
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,100
Oh gosh, ok.

1534
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:05,600
Maybe not.

1535
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,320
Maybe we're ok.

1536
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,480
Wait.

1537
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,460
Oh god, maybe we're not ok.

1538
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,780
Maybe we're ok.

1539
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,020
Maybe we're not ok.

1540
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,380
Wait, maybe we're ok.

1541
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:17,420
Wait, maybe we're ok.

1542
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,020
We're ok.

1543
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:20,760
Destroy?

1544
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:20,960
Destroy?

1545
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:27,970
This

1546
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,640
is like the biggest cardboard... not cardboard.

1547
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,420
Biggest box I've ever seen.

1548
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,900
We got it.

1549
01:53:57,610 --> 01:53:58,970
Alive man.

1550
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,710
Alive man?

1551
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:10,470
Can I come in?

1552
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:11,090
Oh no!

1553
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:11,730
What?

1554
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:20,690
That was just two hits.

1555
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:29,070
I tried, I was too slow.

1556
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:35,380
Should I restart?

1557
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:19,030
Thanks mister.

1558
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:23,630
Yeah, it wasn't you luckily.

1559
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:27,110
What else is down here though?

1560
01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:32,030
Oh, what is that?

1561
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:34,030
I think that's a piece of that other guy.

1562
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:39,270
Luckily it wasn't him, right?

1563
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:40,370
Oh nice!

1564
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:43,190
Oh yeah!

1565
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:44,670
Loot!

1566
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,390
Good, good, good, good.

1567
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,650
Ok.

1568
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:56,070
If you are wondering why everyone calls the guards Barney, it's from the game files.

1569
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:57,050
Same with G-Man.

1570
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:58,950
Thanks!

1571
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:02,530
So true.

1572
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:04,550
I hear something.

1573
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,800
Good job Barney!

1574
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,260
I was about to be like, behind you!

1575
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:17,740
What is this?

1576
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,380
Wait, what is that?

1577
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,300
Looks like a smiley face.

1578
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,960
What the hell is this?

1579
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,700
Come on!

1580
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,900
Come with me if you want to live.

1581
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:41,520
Come on.

1582
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:47,560
Can you open this door?

1583
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:54,190
This guy is just chilling.

1584
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:55,890
He is so ominous looking.

1585
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:04,550
Oh my god, there is a person there.

1586
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,800
Very nice.

1587
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,060
Barney is also the name of the guard you play in one of the expansions called Blue Ships.

1588
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,440
I see.

1589
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,040
Save first.

1590
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,760
So true.

1591
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:29,620
Wait, ok.

1592
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,360
Is this actually parkour?

1593
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,940
This seems not very good idea.

1594
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:39,720
What am

1595
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,640
I trying to get to?

1596
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,660
Now that I think about it.

1597
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:50,460
What is my purpose?

1598
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,840
Maybe the light switch?

1599
01:57:58,780 --> 01:57:59,700
The light switch.

1600
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:00,500
The vent?

1601
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,920
I think I need to get the light switch.

1602
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,680
I need to turn it off first though, no?

1603
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:09,320
Or will it hurt me?

1604
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,340
Aha!

1605
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:17,670
More!

1606
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:21,730
More!

1607
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:21,870
More!

1608
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,670
I did the wrong button.

1609
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:35,500
I think we are good.

1610
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,460
There we go.

1611
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,640
I meant to switch to my gun.

1612
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:47,080
Oh wait, did I just see movement?

1613
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:47,740
No.

1614
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,120
This is so scary.

1615
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:00,540
Stupid.

1616
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:06,160
Dummy.

1617
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,100
Dummy crab.

1618
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:16,090
Barney, where are you?

1619
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:22,010
I'll stay here and guard this area.

1620
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,810
No you won't.

1621
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:25,950
Yeah, yeah, come on.

1622
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:29,130
I don't think... It's like he's stuck.

1623
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:32,530
Are you quivering in your booties Barney?

1624
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:36,750
Come on buddy.

1625
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:38,570
Oh my gosh.

1626
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:39,230
Oh my gosh.

1627
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:40,330
Oh nice, good job.

1628
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:49,570
He's doing his best over there.

1629
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:52,090
Barney!

1630
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,410
You got this!

1631
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:57,250
Pull!

1632
01:59:58,870 --> 01:59:59,630
Pull!

1633
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:06,210
He's dancing it out.

1634
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:07,570
He's dancing out the nerves.

1635
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:08,490
Come on!

1636
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:12,390
Actually...this way.

1637
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,510
Look, look, look.

1638
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:15,670
There is an opening.

1639
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:16,910
It's right here.

1640
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:20,570
Pull!

1641
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:22,330
Push!

1642
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,550
I push from my side.

1643
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:24,570
You pull from your end.

1644
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:34,810
I think we are just going to have to continue onward without him.

1645
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,040
Ain't no party like a Barney dance party.

1646
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,840
My cat actually does this sometimes.

1647
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,260
How many hours until he dies of exhaustion?

1648
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,360
He won't!

1649
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,240
I feel like I'm watching a Sims glitch.

1650
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:10,520
Yeah, because you think you are running the entire thing.

1651
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:11,000
Come on!

1652
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:12,400
Come on!

1653
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,200
What did you say?

1654
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,660
Come on Barney.

1655
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:20,880
Oh wait, he can't even go up.

1656
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:21,440
Nevermind.

1657
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,680
Barney, we are going on without you buddy.

1658
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:32,050
Wait.

1659
02:01:32,190 --> 02:01:32,670
Oh shoot.

1660
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:33,990
Oh this is so hard.

1661
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:48,330
Oh Valve!

1662
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:52,490
Tell him to stop?

1663
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,950
Why?

1664
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,460
Oh my God.

1665
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,540
OK.

1666
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:13,690
I think this is the way I'm supposed to go.

1667
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:22,170
I believe it is.

1668
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:23,770
Very nice.

1669
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:32,600
Why?

1670
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,500
Can I shoot it down myself?

1671
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:14,080
Yeah save.

1672
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:14,980
Let's save real quick.

1673
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,420
Use a handgun instead.

1674
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:23,440
Do you think it's better?

1675
02:03:33,650 --> 02:03:35,050
It's difficult with the shotgun.

1676
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:35,450
OK.

1677
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:39,930
It's for killing the security guard back in the tutorial.

1678
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:44,130
This is my... These are my full life consequences.

1679
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:47,630
Grenade instead?

1680
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:48,670
OK let's try the grenade.

1681
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:51,610
I feel like I'm nervous.

1682
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:00,730
That did not work.

1683
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:09,710
Peek!

1684
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,350
You must reach the Lambda Complex as soon as possible.

1685
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:13,450
I'm working on it!

1686
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:18,050
That was unlucky.

1687
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:20,990
That was unlucky.

1688
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:27,530
We got it.

1689
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:28,530
Easy peasy.

1690
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,530
More paper.

1691
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:33,630
More.

1692
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:37,250
Oh wait.

1693
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:38,850
No, I don't need it.

1694
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:39,490
I got this.

1695
02:04:53,930 --> 02:04:55,330
Maybe I don't got this.

1696
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,420
I tried the crouch jump.

1697
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,940
I think I'm just bad.

1698
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:18,980
There are no smaller boxes.

1699
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:19,820
Maybe in here?

1700
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:29,490
I'll take that.

1701
02:05:29,490 --> 02:05:30,670
Nice.

1702
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:33,570
I'll take that.

1703
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:34,130
Nice.

1704
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:39,110
What's in here?

1705
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:43,710
We just went in a big ol' loop.

1706
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:45,630
Wait, now Barney can come.

1707
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:51,520
I don't think the wood crate is...

1708
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:56,440
I don't think the wood crate is any smaller.

1709
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:57,020
Is it?

1710
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:58,080
Let's see.

1711
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:04,090
The wood crate is just as big, you guys.

1712
02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:05,770
The one up top.

1713
02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:06,950
How do I grab it?

1714
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,460
How do I grab it?

1715
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:18,280
Small box.

1716
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,920
Oh, in the Barney area.

1717
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,120
Oh, thanks guys.

1718
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:35,620
Eh.

1719
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:36,020
Eh.

1720
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:50,880
Yeah,

1721
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:02,280
this will be so worth it, you guys.

1722
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:04,760
Wait for it.

1723
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,640
Wait for the payoff.

1724
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:07,240
It's gonna be great.

1725
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,840
It's gonna be so good.

1726
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:14,340
It's gonna be really good.

1727
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,080
I'm stuck on, I think, a body part, maybe.

1728
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,860
I think you get stuck on the blood textures, maybe.

1729
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,900
I don't know why.

1730
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:32,720
OK.

1731
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:40,980
And there's gonna be... The best weapon is in this box.

1732
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:08,580
Hey, Barney.

1733
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,360
Yeah, we will.

1734
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:13,400
He loves to run.

1735
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,420
That's his favorite activity.

1736
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:20,670
There he goes.

1737
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:23,470
Run like hell.

1738
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,670
He really meant it.

1739
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:30,350
He really meant it.

1740
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:32,470
I'm feeling so paid off right now.

1741
02:08:32,730 --> 02:08:33,750
What are you talking about?

1742
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:37,590
Let's run.

1743
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:39,910
He made it.

1744
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:42,390
Oh my gosh, Barney, I'm so proud of you.

1745
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:55,350
Come on.

1746
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:56,230
Come on.

1747
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:56,910
I'll go slow.

1748
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,150
I'll walk.

1749
02:08:58,450 --> 02:08:59,770
We'll walk like hell.

1750
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:03,190
We'll walk like hell.

1751
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,030
Oh

1752
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,140
my God.

1753
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:31,940
Yes.

1754
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,360
Alright, buddy.

1755
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:35,460
Yes!

1756
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:36,960
Yes!

1757
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:43,240
That's...

1758
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:47,380
Watch out, Barney!

1759
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:52,490
I don't think I got a single one.

1760
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:54,110
That's a lie!

1761
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:56,150
I got one!

1762
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:03,430
So true, Barney.

1763
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,290
So true.

1764
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:11,190
Alright, we have you in here.

1765
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:12,790
We got these guys blown up.

1766
02:10:13,290 --> 02:10:14,070
Let's keep going.

1767
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:26,030
Are you OK?

1768
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:26,070
Are you OK?

1769
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:42,790
Hello other Barney.

1770
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:45,150
OK.

1771
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:46,670
Can I have two of them?

1772
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:49,530
Two of them.

1773
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:49,970
Two of them.

1774
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:50,430
Two of them.

1775
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:51,750
Two of them.

1776
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:00,800
I got it.

1777
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:12,980
Oh, I was going to say there is one behind you.

1778
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:18,520
I'm hearing so many things.

1779
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:21,700
Are you OK?

1780
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,040
What's going on here?

1781
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:33,310
I don't think that's what was supposed to happen.

1782
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:41,270
Barney, it couldn't be helped.

1783
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:43,750
What were they trying to do?

1784
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:47,470
Oh, I think he was getting taken and then the other guy was trying to...

1785
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:00,940
OK.

1786
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:12,360
Good job.

1787
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:13,180
Good job.

1788
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:15,420
That was not good.

1789
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,540
Can I get out of your place?

1790
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,280
Thank you.

1791
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:19,560
That was not good.

1792
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:19,940
Oh my gosh.

1793
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:20,700
I almost shot you.

1794
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:23,680
Thank you.

1795
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,180
Barney is holding his own for real.

1796
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:32,840
These guys are so gross.

1797
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,380
I hear sounds everywhere.

1798
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:39,380
I hear...

1799
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,860
Watch out Barney.

1800
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,140
Don't turn your back on them.

1801
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:52,360
One HP in a dream.

1802
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,580
Yeah, I know.

1803
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:10,140
I'm working on it.

1804
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:12,700
I'm working on it.

1805
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:17,100
There's still more.

1806
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:17,720
There's still...

1807
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:19,740
Did he just say booty shot?

1808
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,520
Booty shot.

1809
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:30,640
Booty shot.

1810
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:32,220
That's what it sounded like he said.

1811
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:34,480
Oh no, he died.

1812
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:36,400
Death by lamp.

1813
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:39,360
The most pathetic of the...

1814
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,740
of the deaths that we've seen.

1815
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:48,060
A tragedy.

1816
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,980
Booty shot.

1817
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:51,940
Booty shot.

1818
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:53,900
I feel like I should save.

1819
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:00,520
It wasn't me.

1820
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:01,700
It wasn't me Barney.

1821
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,460
Definitely not me.

1822
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:11,500
I can get you one, if you like.

1823
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:15,400
Right here.

1824
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:16,040
I got you.

1825
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:19,940
Come here.

1826
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:24,960
There's multiple.

1827
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:26,100
Oh my God, Barney.

1828
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:26,760
Barney.

1829
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:27,400
Barney.

1830
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,720
Barney, are you still alive?

1831
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:30,500
No!

1832
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:35,830
OK Barney, you're alive.

1833
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,330
Why didn't you shoot Barney?

1834
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:42,610
Barney move.

1835
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:44,030
Barney out of the way.

1836
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:46,510
Good job.

1837
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:47,110
Good job.

1838
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:57,410
I'm trying to get Barney his cold one.

1839
02:15:01,690 --> 02:15:02,790
For you.

1840
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,640
He shimmied.

1841
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:10,720
I think he's excited about it.

1842
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:34,580
Everything is A-OK.

1843
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:40,700
Booty shot.

1844
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:41,620
Booty shot.

1845
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:43,580
Guys, I know how to talk to the scientist.

1846
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:44,280
Don't worry.

1847
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,580
Don't worry.

1848
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:47,440
Don't worry.

1849
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,900
You've seen me.

1850
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:50,120
I've been playing the game.

1851
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,420
I've been playing the game.

1852
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:57,480
Booty shot.

1853
02:15:57,680 --> 02:15:58,500
Booty shot.

1854
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:04,920
Oh OK.

1855
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:09,260
Oh come on.

1856
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,440
Come with me.

1857
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:13,980
Come with me if you want to live.

1858
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:58,040
Is that a softlock or am I...

1859
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:06,100
Am I softlocked or...

1860
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:09,160
No?

1861
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:09,800
OK.

1862
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:13,520
They got booty shot.

1863
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:14,720
Booty shot.

1864
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:15,600
Booty shot.

1865
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:20,280
It's so loud.

1866
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:24,400
Start turning this stuff down again.

1867
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:37,710
Booty shot.

1868
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:38,530
Booty shot.

1869
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:43,010
Oh no!

1870
02:17:44,910 --> 02:17:46,730
That was so funny.

1871
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:49,470
He's just going down the little stairs.

1872
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,310
Oh Barney.

1873
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:52,790
Oh scientist.

1874
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:58,590
Shotgun right click is double damage.

1875
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:01,490
Good to know.

1876
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:07,200
It's spelled booty shot of course.

1877
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,020
Of course!

1878
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:14,740
Wow!

1879
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,780
That really did work.

1880
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:22,480
I probably shouldn't hit the thing that says explosive.

1881
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:36,890
Save and try.

1882
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:56,250
No!

1883
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:58,470
Try and come on me.

1884
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:03,450
Oh it's up there.

1885
02:19:07,670 --> 02:19:08,370
Hello.

1886
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:09,750
Hello.

1887
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:11,450
You're so polite.

1888
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:18,690
Will you come with me then?

1889
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:23,390
I'm not going to die.

1890
02:19:24,630 --> 02:19:26,770
Don't tell that to the last Barney though.

1891
02:19:29,130 --> 02:19:30,570
I wouldn't promise.

1892
02:19:33,850 --> 02:19:34,850
Oh shoot.

1893
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,350
Dang it.

1894
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:37,570
Watch out!

1895
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:10,010
Guys I think I need to shut my mouth.

1896
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:17,860
Guys I think I need to start...

1897
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:22,580
Tears going down.

1898
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:29,030
Barney I'm sorry.

1899
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:47,740
Barney is dying and you're laughing.

1900
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:50,260
It was fun while I was the next Barney.

1901
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:51,720
Thanks for all the memories.

1902
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:58,490
Sorry my voice is really starting to give out you guys.

1903
02:20:58,570 --> 02:20:59,950
It doesn't hurt in case you're wondering.

1904
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:02,390
It just doesn't sound so good.

1905
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:11,050
I hear noises everywhere.

1906
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,420
Oh come on.

1907
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:24,620
Ah!

1908
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:31,100
Dang they do so much damage.

1909
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:31,620
Oh my god.

1910
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:32,160
No way.

1911
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,700
I

1912
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,880
think the scientist was dead though.

1913
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:45,880
Mint always sounds lovely.

1914
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:46,540
Thank you!

1915
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,120
I'll go in there in a second.

1916
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,600
I can't...

1917
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:09,630
Can't go in there yet.

1918
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:09,870
Ok.

1919
02:22:11,550 --> 02:22:12,610
Oh yes now.

1920
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:13,010
Yeah.

1921
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:17,810
I hear something chirping.

1922
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:19,890
My cat is not in there.

1923
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:21,130
I hear like a...

1924
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:25,430
How do I get in here?

1925
02:22:27,250 --> 02:22:29,270
New Barney be like did you boost me?

1926
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:35,670
Oh!

1927
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:40,570
I'm missing out on areas.

1928
02:22:45,230 --> 02:22:47,610
Can I make it past?

1929
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:48,490
Ok hold on.

1930
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:58,810
Ok I can't get past that.

1931
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:01,130
Can I get past this?

1932
02:23:07,170 --> 02:23:08,130
Oh.

1933
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:09,950
That's not good.

1934
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:22,620
Dang it.

1935
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:23,480
He still got me.

1936
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,320
Where are we going guys?

1937
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:52,880
We're fine.

1938
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:55,960
What is that?

1939
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:58,540
Whatever it is.

1940
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,820
Oh wait I think it's a headcrab.

1941
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:11,780
Ok, no limbo.

1942
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:17,090
What is...oh!

1943
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:20,550
We made it!

1944
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:24,170
We made it!

1945
02:24:28,870 --> 02:24:29,650
Wow!

1946
02:24:30,470 --> 02:24:31,450
I'm so good.

1947
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:35,050
I'm so good.

1948
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:41,310
World's...no wonder that guy died from that lamp earlier.

1949
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:43,950
It's like the world's sturdiest lamp ever.

1950
02:24:46,330 --> 02:24:47,410
Can I grab this?

1951
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:48,710
Oh I guess I don't need it.

1952
02:24:48,830 --> 02:24:49,210
Ok cool.

1953
02:24:50,350 --> 02:24:50,950
Oh wait.

1954
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:54,070
Ok!

1955
02:24:58,010 --> 02:24:59,890
Time to go into the spooky room.

1956
02:24:59,890 --> 02:25:02,450
Oh I had my thing on this whole time.

1957
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:07,890
I'm scared.

1958
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:21,910
What are you doing?

1959
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:26,380
Did I miss?

1960
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:27,680
Oh shoot.

1961
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:29,140
Hold on.

1962
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:29,880
Excuse me.

1963
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:30,300
Hold on.

1964
02:25:39,950 --> 02:25:41,130
There we go.

1965
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:47,190
Just a coffee break.

1966
02:25:47,350 --> 02:25:49,270
Wow fresh brood.

1967
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:53,590
Very nice.

1968
02:25:57,810 --> 02:25:59,990
Killed so hard he fell twice.

1969
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,590
I know.

1970
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:02,370
What a bozo.

1971
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:07,850
Such a little weak bozo here.

1972
02:26:08,390 --> 02:26:09,750
Are we in the kitchen?

1973
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:11,170
We are in the fridge.

1974
02:26:14,070 --> 02:26:15,370
Oh my god.

1975
02:26:18,130 --> 02:26:19,170
Some overkill.

1976
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:23,150
Don't slip.

1977
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:24,470
Oh my god.

1978
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:24,890
Wait.

1979
02:26:25,430 --> 02:26:25,770
Oh ok.

1980
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:28,850
I was going to say don't slip but like...

1981
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:36,780
What?

1982
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,220
Just chilling eating lunch in the break room.

1983
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:40,040
Maybe it's you who is the real monster.

1984
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,800
Oh god.

1985
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:48,320
I'm stuck.

1986
02:26:55,770 --> 02:26:56,630
I'm scared.

1987
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:56,730
I'm scared.

1988
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:01,370
Ouch.

1989
02:27:01,510 --> 02:27:01,790
Ouch.

1990
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:04,350
Headcrabs are so icky.

1991
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:07,130
Let's switch to my pistol.

1992
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:25,480
Oh my god.

1993
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:26,440
Wait.

1994
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:27,000
Ouch.

1995
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:40,580
You can dodge headcrab lunging by strafing.

1996
02:27:41,020 --> 02:27:41,860
I see.

1997
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:44,460
Thanks for the heads up.

1998
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:03,680
Barney.

1999
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,080
Barney number...

2000
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,700
Another Barney.

2001
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:09,840
More Barney.

2002
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:20,120
I don't know where I was coming from.

2003
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,140
I think you are way too calm for what was happening here.

2004
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:33,400
Are you alive?

2005
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:36,620
Mr. Scientist?

2006
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:40,980
Oh you are alive.

2007
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,040
How

2008
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:50,680
did you live?

2009
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:54,740
There is an energy pack in there.

2010
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:05,630
Calm down you baby.

2011
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:12,300
He is so violent.

2012
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:13,900
I hate boxes.

2013
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:16,180
Whose spine is this?

2014
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:28,960
Someone got like super defleshed.

2015
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,460
It's my spine?

2016
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:33,560
Let's go.

2017
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:34,380
Wait a second.

2018
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:36,540
I want to get in there though.

2019
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:37,860
What's this do?

2020
02:29:40,260 --> 02:29:40,960
Oh.

2021
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:42,040
Interesting.

2022
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:49,820
I know there is this.

2023
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:52,660
But I don't want to do it just yet.

2024
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,500
I want to get back in there.

2025
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:56,220
It's a puzzle.

2026
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:07,250
Is it a puzzle?

2027
02:30:10,470 --> 02:30:11,950
Ask the scientist to heal you.

2028
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:12,290
Will he?

2029
02:30:14,190 --> 02:30:14,890
Heal me.

2030
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:17,930
I am a fellow scientist.

2031
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:19,890
Oh sorry.

2032
02:30:25,170 --> 02:30:26,210
Oh wait.

2033
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:32,110
Only if you are at 25 or below.

2034
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:33,030
I see.

2035
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:35,150
Neat.

2036
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,390
Oh.

2037
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:57,360
Duh.

2038
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:58,480
That's how I got in before.

2039
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,280
Sorry Mr. Scientist.

2040
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:07,900
Give me a second.

2041
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:22,040
We are going this way.

2042
02:31:25,710 --> 02:31:27,110
We will go this way.

2043
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:29,690
And we have to take this.

2044
02:31:30,230 --> 02:31:31,250
Once it comes around.

2045
02:31:32,150 --> 02:31:33,310
Once it comes back.

2046
02:31:35,490 --> 02:31:36,630
You can beat the meat.

2047
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:39,990
Here King.

2048
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:40,650
You drop this.

2049
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,310
Hands Barney.

2050
02:31:41,310 --> 02:31:41,750
Number 3.

2051
02:31:41,810 --> 02:31:42,450
His spine.

2052
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:44,650
Wait.

2053
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:45,390
Can you come back?

2054
02:31:46,490 --> 02:31:48,510
Is there a head crab in one of these boxes?

2055
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:54,890
There isn't.

2056
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:58,850
That's actually quite shocking.

2057
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:09,280
I'm scared.

2058
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:09,940
Wait.

2059
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:33,240
Mr. Man.

2060
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,420
Mr. Security Man.

2061
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:42,920
I'm going to save real quick.

2062
02:32:48,060 --> 02:32:51,060
There is just someone's skull in here.

2063
02:32:57,530 --> 02:33:00,050
They are picking it clean.

2064
02:33:00,410 --> 02:33:01,570
These guys are starving.

2065
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,560
Oh this room doesn't seem very good.

2066
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:22,520
Why is it...oh my...is it these guys?

2067
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:24,920
Another rope.

2068
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:25,780
Yeah.

2069
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:27,840
Another rope.

2070
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:33,040
Unrelated to today's events.

2071
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:42,910
Totally unrelated.

2072
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:49,540
The noise in here is so weird.

2073
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:49,820
Wait.

2074
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:51,260
I can probably just beat this guy.

2075
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:52,660
Beat the meat.

2076
02:33:57,980 --> 02:33:59,600
What a weakling.

2077
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:09,360
60%.

2078
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:09,940
Let's go.

2079
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:13,200
Zide.

2080
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:13,700
Zid.

2081
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:14,440
Zide.

2082
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:16,060
Thank you so much for the 10 Gems.

2083
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:16,920
Thank you.

2084
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:18,880
What am I supposed to do in here?

2085
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:20,560
I think I'm supposed to go up.

2086
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:22,600
Over there?

2087
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:25,760
But I'm bad at jumping.

2088
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:31,600
I don't like the sound in this thing at all.

2089
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:34,620
Sounds like someone poorly strumming a guitar.

2090
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:38,360
Over there.

2091
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:26,360
He doesn't know where to go.

2092
02:35:29,490 --> 02:35:30,150
Hi!

2093
02:35:35,150 --> 02:35:40,430
We can still climb.

2094
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:41,750
Is this where I was before?

2095
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,390
No.

2096
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:43,550
Where am I?

2097
02:35:48,130 --> 02:35:50,450
He said...well, he's a little confused.

2098
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:57,640
I hate boxes.

2099
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:01,900
Be there or be square.

2100
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:03,840
We made a big circle.

2101
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:05,480
I see where we are.

2102
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:07,740
Maybe we should go up?

2103
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:09,820
OK.

2104
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:11,260
Nothing seems to be here.

2105
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:17,700
I killed him.

2106
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:21,340
I took some hits though.

2107
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:25,580
I should be used to...

2108
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:30,300
I should be used to the hidden headcrabs by now.

2109
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:40,160
Greetings.

2110
02:36:55,170 --> 02:36:57,270
I think you missed most of those shots, Party.

2111
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:02,210
He just dove through the window.

2112
02:37:03,950 --> 02:37:04,710
Greetings.

2113
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,060
Oh yeah baby!

2114
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:18,320
Sweet.

2115
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:19,420
Sweet health.

2116
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:23,140
There wasn't even anything in here with you.

2117
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:27,360
You just chose to dove through the window for no reason.

2118
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:35,320
Maybe he was trying to get away from...I guess he was trapped in this room.

2119
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:37,380
Excuse me.

2120
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:44,680
Oh!

2121
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:49,360
Just hang in there.

2122
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,120
Hang in there.

2123
02:37:59,100 --> 02:37:59,620
Hello.

2124
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,620
Thank you for the raid.

2125
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:02,520
Hello, hello.

2126
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:04,420
I'm playing.

2127
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:09,400
I'm playing Half-Life for the first time ever.

2128
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:11,100
Is this where we are supposed to go or this way?

2129
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:19,520
You guys see that?

2130
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,380
Wait, open up the door.

2131
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:23,680
Open up the door.

2132
02:38:28,170 --> 02:38:28,870
G-Man.

2133
02:38:31,410 --> 02:38:32,490
G-Man.

2134
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:40,130
Oh my god, why is the guitar string so loud now?

2135
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:44,310
Why

2136
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:04,820
are you so rude?

2137
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:13,340
You talk too much.

2138
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:15,160
I think the audio might be bugged.

2139
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:18,380
Every time they...

2140
02:39:18,380 --> 02:39:20,720
I think the audio is bugged.

2141
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:27,170
It's funky.

2142
02:39:27,390 --> 02:39:28,730
Oh hello.

2143
02:39:29,190 --> 02:39:30,050
It's real funky.

2144
02:39:33,210 --> 02:39:34,370
That's just the echo.

2145
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:35,190
Is it really?

2146
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:39,910
Oh I made it.

2147
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:43,610
You got this.

2148
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:45,010
I'm coming for you.

2149
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:02,650
I

2150
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:10,790
don't know why I jumped guys.

2151
02:40:11,790 --> 02:40:12,570
Oh.

2152
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:17,490
He is probably just screaming.

2153
02:40:18,190 --> 02:40:19,250
Because he is so excited.

2154
02:40:30,730 --> 02:40:32,380
I can't...

2155
02:40:32,930 --> 02:40:36,050
You got this.

2156
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,850
Oh.

2157
02:40:40,970 --> 02:40:43,410
Barney looks really suspicious down there.

2158
02:40:43,850 --> 02:40:44,670
Not gonna lie.

2159
02:40:51,150 --> 02:40:52,570
I watched a Minecraft movie last night.

2160
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:54,510
My opinions on it aren't great.

2161
02:40:57,930 --> 02:40:58,590
Oh.

2162
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:09,800
Oh my gosh.

2163
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,360
Seriously?

2164
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:11,860
Who built this?

2165
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:42,930
Uh...

2166
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:48,580
We've got hostiles.

2167
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:54,360
I think we do.

2168
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:08,320
What's going on?

2169
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,120
Oh charger.

2170
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:25,860
Let's go.

2171
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:30,100
They panicked.

2172
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:31,480
Yeah.

2173
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:35,020
I can tell.

2174
02:42:38,890 --> 02:42:39,870
Oh wait.

2175
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:41,130
Maybe I should go in.

2176
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:56,170
Walk?

2177
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:01,360
What do you mean F6?

2178
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,540
I already saved you guys.

2179
02:43:25,610 --> 02:43:26,810
I already saved.

2180
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:33,000
Oh my god.

2181
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,200
I think I saw a headcrab.

2182
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:35,720
Oh no.

2183
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:36,540
There is just a guy.

2184
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:58,180
Shotgun works well on these.

2185
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:05,840
OK.

2186
02:44:14,990 --> 02:44:19,330
Honestly I kind of want to reload so I don't take the damage.

2187
02:44:31,170 --> 02:44:32,830
What's this now?

2188
02:44:35,490 --> 02:44:40,670
Maybe I should have blocked it with the box.

2189
02:44:43,950 --> 02:44:45,070
OK.

2190
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:51,170
Uranium?

2191
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:00,500
Shoot.

2192
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:01,100
Oh shoot.

2193
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,620
OK.

2194
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:14,140
Good timing.

2195
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:20,240
Double whammy.

2196
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:30,420
Free soda.

2197
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,620
I'm saving?

2198
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:34,040
Alright.

2199
02:45:34,180 --> 02:45:35,120
Now we are good to save.

2200
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,180
That looks like a good gun in there.

2201
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:40,460
Dang it.

2202
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:43,080
Can I vent?

2203
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:43,900
Wait a second.

2204
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:45,800
Come here table.

2205
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:46,540
Come here.

2206
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:47,160
Come here.

2207
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:50,380
Come here.

2208
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:50,760
Come here.

2209
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:51,020
Come here.

2210
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:51,620
Come here.

2211
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,900
I pushed too much in the corner.

2212
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:02,740
It's like making a sound but it's not moving.

2213
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:04,960
Maybe I'll go with this one.

2214
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:08,060
Stuck on the body.

2215
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:13,660
I tried.

2216
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:14,760
You can't get up there from here.

2217
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:16,560
Dang it.

2218
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:20,240
Well thanks for saving me.

2219
02:46:21,160 --> 02:46:22,600
Some time I suppose.

2220
02:46:44,500 --> 02:46:45,940
I think there is another one.

2221
02:46:55,810 --> 02:46:56,370
Easy.

2222
02:46:56,370 --> 02:46:56,490
Easy.

2223
02:46:58,350 --> 02:47:00,850
First time catching you live and you are playing one of my favorites.

2224
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,190
Thank you.

2225
02:47:01,330 --> 02:47:02,130
Thank you Jason.

2226
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:04,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2227
02:47:04,810 --> 02:47:05,450
Welcome.

2228
02:47:07,450 --> 02:47:08,450
Welcome in.

2229
02:47:11,790 --> 02:47:16,510
I always forget that I can quick switch like this.

2230
02:47:20,610 --> 02:47:21,250
OK.

2231
02:47:21,250 --> 02:47:22,610
Teleports behind you.

2232
02:47:22,990 --> 02:47:24,750
Nothing personal kid.

2233
02:47:26,370 --> 02:47:28,470
Here we go.

2234
02:47:29,710 --> 02:47:31,410
How are we getting in?

2235
02:47:40,140 --> 02:47:41,100
There is another?

2236
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:45,700
Oh I see it.

2237
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:56,300
I think I just hit the side.

2238
02:47:57,940 --> 02:47:58,260
OK.

2239
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:58,320
OK.

2240
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:04,680
Imagine those don't activate.

2241
02:48:05,740 --> 02:48:08,360
Unless you pass this thing.

2242
02:48:08,860 --> 02:48:14,840
But I also am nervous if they would activate if I get too close.

2243
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:20,260
You

2244
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:27,500
can ignore deactivated turrets?

2245
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:28,200
Oh you can.

2246
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:30,160
Dang.

2247
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:31,720
But what if...

2248
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:34,940
I guess if I cross this...

2249
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:36,920
How do I get through this?

2250
02:48:49,210 --> 02:48:51,930
I think it might be time.

2251
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:54,050
Nevermind.

2252
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:02,830
Headcrab generator?

2253
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:04,130
Yeah that's what I am thinking.

2254
02:49:06,090 --> 02:49:06,450
Alright.

2255
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:16,200
Let's try.

2256
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:20,980
Did I get it?

2257
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:24,080
Uh oh.

2258
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:34,720
No, not the slippery floor.

2259
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,360
That's so messed up.

2260
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,300
This is so... Wait, this is actually so messed up.

2261
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:55,500
Something happened.

2262
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:57,160
Wait.

2263
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:08,300
Rip the scientist?

2264
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:10,280
I mean...

2265
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:13,600
Nice.

2266
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:14,220
Alright.

2267
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:23,780
This is so scary.

2268
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:26,620
I imagine you shouldn't go down that way.

2269
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,880
We made it!

2270
02:50:32,060 --> 02:50:33,720
Why are they activated though?

2271
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:34,620
I didn't do anything.

2272
02:50:42,130 --> 02:50:42,870
What was that?

2273
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:44,650
There is something up there.

2274
02:50:45,830 --> 02:50:47,170
I want to go up there.

2275
02:50:48,070 --> 02:50:48,930
I want to go to there.

2276
02:50:55,330 --> 02:50:56,830
Why is this guy everywhere?

2277
02:50:59,670 --> 02:51:00,710
Gee man.

2278
02:51:03,370 --> 02:51:04,130
Okay.

2279
02:51:04,770 --> 02:51:06,790
I am gonna touch these.

2280
02:51:08,350 --> 02:51:10,150
I guess the turrets are down so it's okay.

2281
02:51:13,010 --> 02:51:14,110
Radio check.

2282
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:23,870
What that mean?

2283
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:24,410
Where are you?

2284
02:51:24,610 --> 02:51:24,870
What?

2285
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:34,530
I guess this is if you need a hiding spot.

2286
02:51:38,570 --> 02:51:39,090
Radio!

2287
02:51:39,230 --> 02:51:40,130
Hey I am here!

2288
02:51:40,870 --> 02:51:41,950
Hey I am here!

2289
02:51:42,130 --> 02:51:44,810
They are like a nasty alien.

2290
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:46,590
I can hear them knocking at the door.

2291
02:51:51,650 --> 02:51:53,190
Search and destroy?

2292
02:52:13,850 --> 02:52:14,670
Wait!

2293
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:26,780
Search and rescue.

2294
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:28,180
Thank god you are here.

2295
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:35,760
I think we just got the next gun.

2296
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:38,180
Rescue!

2297
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:41,620
That was the thing we heard.

2298
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:44,440
Was there a way?

2299
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:47,320
I guess I could have saved the guy if...

2300
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:52,080
If I had killed that guy first.

2301
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:54,060
Sorry buddy!

2302
02:52:57,740 --> 02:52:58,820
Up we go!

2303
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:09,430
Hey buddy!

2304
02:53:09,610 --> 02:53:10,170
Quit running!

2305
02:53:10,310 --> 02:53:11,110
You are going too fast!

2306
02:53:20,150 --> 02:53:21,270
I am with the science!

2307
02:53:21,450 --> 02:53:22,070
What is this?

2308
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:23,970
What is going on here?

2309
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:26,410
That was a lot!

2310
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:31,690
I am just eating bullets here.

2311
02:53:38,100 --> 02:53:39,100
Don't hit me!

2312
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:40,060
I am with the science!

2313
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:42,760
Wasn't there a guy up here?

2314
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:43,800
Did I kill him?

2315
02:53:48,670 --> 02:53:50,090
Where are you?

2316
02:53:50,570 --> 02:53:50,930
Hello!

2317
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:55,790
Yes sir!

2318
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:14,560
What is this?

2319
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:18,100
I'll take that.

2320
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:19,680
This is where I came from?

2321
02:54:21,060 --> 02:54:21,600
OK.

2322
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:24,280
I know the music is really quiet.

2323
02:54:24,480 --> 02:54:26,120
It's because the game is...

2324
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:28,240
kind of inconsistent with the volume.

2325
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:30,600
There we go.

2326
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:34,040
There you go!

2327
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:35,720
You can have your little soundtrack.

2328
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:44,900
OK.

2329
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,160
Wait, I am going to heal fully too.

2330
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:51,780
I don't know what I am thinking.

2331
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:53,620
Nice.

2332
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:55,060
OK.

2333
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:57,180
Let's keep going baby!

2334
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:58,440
We are killing it I feel.

2335
02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:00,000
Do not stack.

2336
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:06,080
At least I saved that guy, no?

2337
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:09,380
Evil!

2338
02:55:13,590 --> 02:55:14,310
Ewww!

2339
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:18,430
Feeling around with their little tongues.

2340
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:34,520
I love how we have to worry about...

2341
02:55:35,380 --> 02:55:37,660
these guys now...

2342
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:38,740
and the monsters.

2343
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:43,600
I hear one.

2344
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:44,780
I think I see him.

2345
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:45,200
Oop!

2346
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:49,740
I

2347
02:55:58,310 --> 02:55:59,670
kill you!

2348
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:06,540
Let's go!

2349
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:16,780
What's going on?

2350
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:19,760
This is so typical.

2351
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:26,460
They mess up and then they come in to kill all the people that...

2352
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:29,280
that are the witnesses.

2353
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,820
This is so typical.

2354
02:56:35,020 --> 02:56:37,940
They are just blowing up by themselves.

2355
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:41,880
Poor nerd.

2356
02:56:42,480 --> 02:56:43,480
How do I get through there?

2357
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:45,720
I am going to kill these guys.

2358
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:49,240
I know I am going to accidentally cut them somehow.

2359
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:55,940
I am lost.

2360
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:57,340
So lost.

2361
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:07,220
I don't understand what the charge is for.

2362
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:11,560
I know it's for my flashlight, but what else?

2363
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:14,720
Because I am not using my flashlight right now.

2364
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:18,080
Oh my armor!

2365
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:21,600
My shield!

2366
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:24,820
Here I am thinking it's a different thing.

2367
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:28,220
Power armor.

2368
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:44,780
Maybe they blew themselves up.

2369
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:56,680
I see now.

2370
02:57:56,860 --> 02:57:58,060
I see now.

2371
02:57:58,180 --> 02:57:59,560
I don't think I can go that way.

2372
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:12,580
I am getting it just in case.

2373
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:15,080
There are two of them.

2374
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:24,080
We got one, no worries.

2375
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:27,840
Where is the other one?

2376
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,480
Where is the other one?

2377
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:38,380
Just drop a grenade down there.

2378
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:39,300
OK!

2379
02:58:40,020 --> 02:58:41,100
Oh I see it.

2380
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:47,900
I don't think I got it.

2381
02:58:52,890 --> 02:58:55,910
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

2382
02:58:58,030 --> 02:58:59,970
OK, I'll drop the grenade over here.

2383
02:59:36,620 --> 02:59:41,500
Is that a soft lock or...?

2384
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:52,600
I think I messed up.

2385
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:55,880
Oh shoot.

2386
02:59:56,340 --> 02:59:56,840
OK.

2387
03:00:10,670 --> 03:00:12,690
I did it.

2388
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:20,510
Chill!

2389
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:20,990
Chill!

2390
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:21,230
Chill!

2391
03:00:22,230 --> 03:00:25,450
Wait, I need my other gun.

2392
03:00:26,270 --> 03:00:27,030
Wait, hold on.

2393
03:00:27,690 --> 03:00:27,970
Wait.

2394
03:00:29,350 --> 03:00:31,070
You guys are alive still, right?

2395
03:00:31,610 --> 03:00:32,010
Ouch.

2396
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:33,050
I think they are dead.

2397
03:00:38,350 --> 03:00:39,170
There we go.

2398
03:00:39,270 --> 03:00:39,750
Oh my goodness.

2399
03:00:44,280 --> 03:00:46,120
I think they both died.

2400
03:01:04,060 --> 03:01:05,020
I'm sorry.

2401
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:09,480
He looks so pathetic there.

2402
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:10,180
Where is the other guy?

2403
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:10,260
OK.

2404
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:17,380
There was a whole other guy, but...

2405
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,000
He's...maybe he went up.

2406
03:01:22,060 --> 03:01:23,480
The other guy exploded.

2407
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:27,320
I hear I was just coping a little bit.

2408
03:01:34,250 --> 03:01:35,850
Oh this is where I came from.

2409
03:01:39,150 --> 03:01:41,510
Well, if they hadn't run...

2410
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:49,050
If they hadn't run, I would have been able to do something.

2411
03:01:50,210 --> 03:01:52,330
I'm not victim blaming or anything.

2412
03:01:52,410 --> 03:01:53,850
I'm just saying that...

2413
03:01:54,930 --> 03:01:57,850
Maybe they should have...

2414
03:02:00,090 --> 03:02:00,530
Just...

2415
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:04,070
They are running from me because I'm scary.

2416
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:09,770
There is no way here I'll save now.

2417
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:13,270
Maybe not the best place to save.

2418
03:02:13,390 --> 03:02:14,950
Maybe I could be doing better, but...

2419
03:02:15,930 --> 03:02:18,850
You know, this is my first time playing the game, so...

2420
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:29,320
I know where this is.

2421
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:35,920
Yes.

2422
03:02:40,470 --> 03:02:41,710
I'm doing great.

2423
03:02:41,790 --> 03:02:42,050
Really.

2424
03:02:44,890 --> 03:02:45,630
Let's go.

2425
03:02:49,570 --> 03:02:51,630
Better than most streamers I've seen.

2426
03:02:55,390 --> 03:02:59,430
I'm not really an FPS player either, so...

2427
03:03:01,010 --> 03:03:01,970
I was...Oh.

2428
03:03:02,170 --> 03:03:03,890
That was weird.

2429
03:03:04,330 --> 03:03:05,010
What is that?

2430
03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:05,830
What did I just hit?

2431
03:03:08,690 --> 03:03:09,690
A bunch of soldiers.

2432
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:12,870
Dialogue is assembled from a bunch of sound files that are strung together.

2433
03:03:14,130 --> 03:03:14,930
Strung together.

2434
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:17,050
To make sentences.

2435
03:03:17,230 --> 03:03:18,870
It makes them sound goofy, but it's pretty cool.

2436
03:03:19,490 --> 03:03:20,790
Press Q to swap your Alaska.

2437
03:03:20,930 --> 03:03:22,330
Oh yeah, I do know the Q.

2438
03:03:25,850 --> 03:03:26,930
I'm just...I don't know.

2439
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:31,790
I like to switch guns, so I'm not consistent.

2440
03:03:32,810 --> 03:03:34,170
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

2441
03:03:34,290 --> 03:03:35,750
Now I'm really lost.

2442
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:37,130
Is that the door I'm supposed to go?

2443
03:03:42,570 --> 03:03:43,670
Is it here?

2444
03:03:45,810 --> 03:03:46,270
Yes?

2445
03:03:59,330 --> 03:04:00,030
What

2446
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:08,160
is that sound?

2447
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:10,240
What does that mean?

2448
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:14,100
Is this a boss?

2449
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:24,680
I'm just standing out here like a stinking sitting duck.

2450
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:48,200
Hold on.

2451
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:49,220
I'm trying to...Oh.

2452
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:50,540
That's what I was doing.

2453
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:52,820
Is

2454
03:04:59,090 --> 03:05:00,630
this thing going to bomb me?

2455
03:05:08,570 --> 03:05:09,550
I think so.

2456
03:05:13,550 --> 03:05:15,150
Fire in the hole!

2457
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:19,280
Oh shoot.

2458
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:27,660
Oh my god.

2459
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:27,920
Wait.

2460
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:29,340
I was fixing my nose, please.

2461
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:35,860
I don't want the crowbar!

2462
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:38,600
There we go.

2463
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:41,260
Oh, these guys are tough.

2464
03:06:00,130 --> 03:06:02,370
Ok, maybe I should switch back to this thing.

2465
03:06:04,130 --> 03:06:05,210
You have a nose?

2466
03:06:05,210 --> 03:06:08,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2467
03:06:09,070 --> 03:06:10,790
Oh, she's got a nose?

2468
03:06:11,270 --> 03:06:12,110
Since when?

2469
03:06:13,570 --> 03:06:14,350
Can I just leave?

2470
03:06:36,280 --> 03:06:37,360
Access back.

2471
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:41,120
Holy moly.

2472
03:06:41,800 --> 03:06:42,580
Holy moly.

2473
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:43,360
Wait.

2474
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:44,600
Anything over here?

2475
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:45,100
No?

2476
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:45,540
Ok.

2477
03:06:46,400 --> 03:06:47,760
It's so loud.

2478
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:51,020
I'm going to turn it down some.

2479
03:06:56,900 --> 03:06:57,380
Ok.

2480
03:06:59,140 --> 03:07:00,980
I'm going to leap of faith.

2481
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:06,570
I see you.

2482
03:07:06,910 --> 03:07:07,530
Where did you go?

2483
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:09,390
Where did you go?

2484
03:07:22,540 --> 03:07:23,020
I

2485
03:07:36,200 --> 03:07:37,180
didn't move.

2486
03:07:41,780 --> 03:07:42,380
Oh, ok.

2487
03:07:50,270 --> 03:07:52,010
Where the hell did you come from?

2488
03:07:52,990 --> 03:07:54,250
Is the guy still down here?

2489
03:07:54,450 --> 03:07:55,090
Oh, yes he is.

2490
03:07:59,650 --> 03:08:00,330
Excuse me.

2491
03:08:00,370 --> 03:08:00,770
Bye bye.

2492
03:08:07,290 --> 03:08:11,770
I'm scared of saving right now.

2493
03:08:12,530 --> 03:08:14,170
Because I might want to do that part over.

2494
03:08:19,390 --> 03:08:19,870
Ok.

2495
03:08:20,570 --> 03:08:21,210
We made it.

2496
03:08:21,350 --> 03:08:21,870
Very good.

2497
03:08:22,110 --> 03:08:22,530
Let's go.

2498
03:08:31,780 --> 03:08:32,700
What's this part?

2499
03:08:32,820 --> 03:08:33,100
Hold on.

2500
03:08:33,220 --> 03:08:34,280
Let's check out what we got.

2501
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:40,020
Save just in case?

2502
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:41,120
Ok.

2503
03:08:42,420 --> 03:08:43,620
I think you are right.

2504
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:45,360
I think I shouldn't do that part over.

2505
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:50,200
I think you are right.

2506
03:09:05,320 --> 03:09:10,320
I might die.

2507
03:09:18,620 --> 03:09:20,360
I might die.

2508
03:09:24,480 --> 03:09:26,500
Serves you right for skipping dialogue.

2509
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:34,700
I'm just out here trying to live my best life in the game.

2510
03:09:34,840 --> 03:09:37,180
I don't have a life outside the game because I'm dead.

2511
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:43,460
I can't believe they are trying to kill us though.

2512
03:09:43,620 --> 03:09:45,820
You could look at Gordon Freeman and be like, what a nerd.

2513
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:47,220
This guy can't do anything.

2514
03:09:49,540 --> 03:09:51,540
Ok, there are so many places to go.

2515
03:09:52,700 --> 03:09:54,000
I'm a little overwhelmed.

2516
03:09:54,980 --> 03:09:55,740
Oh, booty.

2517
03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:00,180
Oh, I heard...

2518
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:03,580
Oh

2519
03:10:07,060 --> 03:10:08,240
wait, maybe I can't.

2520
03:10:08,460 --> 03:10:09,320
Let's just open.

2521
03:10:10,260 --> 03:10:10,900
Booty shot.

2522
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:11,720
Booty shot.

2523
03:10:15,860 --> 03:10:17,800
Wait, maybe I don't hear a headcrab.

2524
03:10:17,900 --> 03:10:21,920
Maybe I hear a little... the roaches.

2525
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:39,380
I think overall that was probably our most important...

2526
03:10:39,380 --> 03:10:41,100
Oh, we are here.

2527
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:44,660
Remember I was trying to get up there.

2528
03:10:44,820 --> 03:10:45,900
Oh my gosh.

2529
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:49,440
This is where we are at.

2530
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:52,060
You alright?

2531
03:10:58,040 --> 03:10:58,640
You ok?

2532
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:11,540
Alright, we made it through.

2533
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:12,540
Cool, cool, cool.

2534
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:16,700
Actually, I'm going to go back to this gun.

2535
03:11:21,360 --> 03:11:22,280
Where did...

2536
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:25,060
Is this where I came from?

2537
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,080
I think so.

2538
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:28,520
So then I go left.

2539
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:30,340
I drank too much.

2540
03:11:39,890 --> 03:11:40,970
Wait, wait.

2541
03:11:41,430 --> 03:11:42,050
There we go.

2542
03:11:43,370 --> 03:11:45,210
Ok, more ammo.

2543
03:11:45,450 --> 03:11:46,030
We'll take that.

2544
03:11:47,410 --> 03:11:49,710
This is a bizarre storage area place.

2545
03:11:54,350 --> 03:11:54,870
Alright.

2546
03:11:59,630 --> 03:12:01,250
Take it slow on the fan.

2547
03:12:01,790 --> 03:12:02,830
Wait, go back to the fan.

2548
03:12:02,930 --> 03:12:03,310
Like here?

2549
03:12:07,950 --> 03:12:08,330
Cool.

2550
03:12:15,810 --> 03:12:18,670
I don't think I need to take it slow.

2551
03:12:27,460 --> 03:12:28,220
Alright!

2552
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:33,440
Yeah, it stopped for me.

2553
03:12:34,660 --> 03:12:36,580
It was like ladies first.

2554
03:12:38,860 --> 03:12:41,700
That was kind of silly.

2555
03:12:42,860 --> 03:12:44,600
Where do I go first though?

2556
03:12:45,620 --> 03:12:46,200
Maybe here?

2557
03:12:49,540 --> 03:12:50,660
Oh, hello!

2558
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:24,040
Ok!

2559
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:48,980
I know where we are.

2560
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:54,100
Oh wow, there was literally a single more charge in it.

2561
03:13:54,400 --> 03:13:55,100
That's so funny.

2562
03:13:58,900 --> 03:14:02,660
But, before I do that...

2563
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:04,940
Wait, can I not go back in?

2564
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:05,920
Oh shoot.

2565
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:08,880
Oh wait, it's again.

2566
03:14:10,040 --> 03:14:11,280
There was up.

2567
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:13,160
This one.

2568
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:15,020
This one.

2569
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:24,320
Let's check out in here real quick.

2570
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:28,400
Upies, upies, upies.

2571
03:14:33,720 --> 03:14:35,040
Just kidding.

2572
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:44,840
Ok.

2573
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:46,320
Just kidding.

2574
03:14:52,350 --> 03:14:53,670
Nothing here.

2575
03:14:58,810 --> 03:15:00,210
Does this even work?

2576
03:15:01,670 --> 03:15:02,370
Oh dang.

2577
03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:04,230
That would be so crazy if it did.

2578
03:15:05,830 --> 03:15:07,250
This doesn't work anymore either.

2579
03:15:08,770 --> 03:15:09,430
Guys!

2580
03:15:10,830 --> 03:15:15,530
My throat is starting to give out so I might cut it off here.

2581
03:15:22,290 --> 03:15:26,190
I think this is an ok point to stop at.

2582
03:15:26,670 --> 03:15:27,330
Is this a good stop?

2583
03:15:27,470 --> 03:15:28,290
Yeah yeah yeah.

2584
03:15:29,150 --> 03:15:30,350
Good progress made.

2585
03:15:30,970 --> 03:15:31,530
Yippee!

2586
03:15:31,830 --> 03:15:33,330
This has been so fun!

2587
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:37,450
This has been so so so much fun!

2588
03:15:37,730 --> 03:15:40,490
I hope you guys are enjoying it too.

2589
03:15:41,090 --> 03:15:44,930
I love how just goofy everything is so far.

2590
03:15:45,830 --> 03:15:46,830
Don't you too?

2591
03:15:48,230 --> 03:15:48,830
Ok.

2592
03:15:49,570 --> 03:15:50,750
Alright Mr. Scientist.

2593
03:15:55,670 --> 03:15:58,250
It's so fun doing better than I thought.

2594
03:15:59,690 --> 03:16:01,490
I'm a bit of a gamer.

2595
03:16:03,230 --> 03:16:06,590
If you... would say I'm a bit of a gamer.

2596
03:16:06,890 --> 03:16:08,910
I'm a bit of a gamer gal.

2597
03:16:14,450 --> 03:16:16,710
I'll give you a close up of my glasses.

2598
03:16:20,830 --> 03:16:21,930
My nerd gear.

2599
03:16:22,110 --> 03:16:23,130
Check out my new gear.

2600
03:16:25,250 --> 03:16:26,350
Thanks for playing a classic.

2601
03:16:26,490 --> 03:16:27,710
You are doing amazing for a first timer.

2602
03:16:27,790 --> 03:16:28,210
No cap.

2603
03:16:29,190 --> 03:16:29,550
Thanks!

2604
03:16:29,630 --> 03:16:30,650
I hope your voice keeps healing up.

2605
03:16:30,750 --> 03:16:31,170
Thank you.

2606
03:16:31,210 --> 03:16:31,710
Thank you.

2607
03:16:33,810 --> 03:16:34,270
Thank you.

2608
03:16:34,290 --> 03:16:34,590
Thank you.

2609
03:16:34,610 --> 03:16:35,170
Thank you.

2610
03:16:35,530 --> 03:16:36,410
My glasses.

2611
03:16:37,410 --> 03:16:39,050
I have a degree.

2612
03:16:42,430 --> 03:16:43,990
In Simpology.

2613
03:16:45,130 --> 03:16:46,310
That's right.

2614
03:16:46,430 --> 03:16:47,470
I am a simp.

2615
03:16:47,730 --> 03:16:49,650
That's Dr. Simp to you.

2616
03:16:50,690 --> 03:16:53,430
That's Dr. Simp to you.

2617
03:16:54,590 --> 03:16:56,770
A Simpology degree.

2618
03:16:57,770 --> 03:17:00,930
I am studying Simposis.

2619
03:17:01,990 --> 03:17:02,710
The...

2620
03:17:13,900 --> 03:17:15,340
Dr. Minky.

2621
03:17:17,630 --> 03:17:19,850
You might have Simposis.

2622
03:17:19,970 --> 03:17:21,490
That's why I'm studying it.

2623
03:17:23,050 --> 03:17:24,610
And I have it too.

2624
03:17:25,270 --> 03:17:26,110
For science.

2625
03:17:26,630 --> 03:17:30,770
I self-administered it to me.

2626
03:17:30,770 --> 03:17:33,970
So that I could study it's effects.

2627
03:17:34,070 --> 03:17:35,730
And I only have...

2628
03:17:35,730 --> 03:17:36,310
Checks watch.

2629
03:17:37,310 --> 03:17:38,010
20...

2630
03:17:38,010 --> 03:17:38,590
Checks watch.

2631
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:39,730
For...

2632
03:17:39,730 --> 03:17:40,250
Checks watch.

2633
03:17:41,550 --> 03:17:41,890
No.

2634
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:45,670
24 hours left to live.

2635
03:17:49,580 --> 03:17:52,110
My research is not going well.

2636
03:17:54,710 --> 03:17:55,550
And...

2637
03:17:57,310 --> 03:17:58,150
Yeah.

2638
03:17:59,070 --> 03:18:01,110
I would like to...

2639
03:18:01,710 --> 03:18:03,430
I will leave...

2640
03:18:04,370 --> 03:18:05,290
All my research...

2641
03:18:06,370 --> 03:18:07,030
In...

2642
03:18:07,030 --> 03:18:09,110
In one page notes.

2643
03:18:09,450 --> 03:18:11,450
Scattered throughout my research lab.

2644
03:18:11,570 --> 03:18:12,610
Which is...

2645
03:18:12,610 --> 03:18:15,210
50 bajillion...

2646
03:18:15,210 --> 03:18:16,210
Rooms.

2647
03:18:16,850 --> 03:18:19,650
And sometimes there might be little cassette tapes.

2648
03:18:19,650 --> 03:18:21,810
That you must listen to.

2649
03:18:22,810 --> 03:18:23,450
So...

2650
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:25,830
I'm gonna read...

2651
03:18:25,830 --> 03:18:27,290
Or I'm gonna leave my diary.

2652
03:18:27,610 --> 03:18:30,470
And all my research and findings in notes.

2653
03:18:30,690 --> 03:18:32,210
Scattered throughout the facility.

2654
03:18:33,770 --> 03:18:34,410
And...

2655
03:18:35,990 --> 03:18:37,390
Yeah, good luck.

2656
03:18:40,790 --> 03:18:41,430
Slenderman.

2657
03:18:43,690 --> 03:18:44,970
You'll search for them?

2658
03:18:45,070 --> 03:18:45,770
I believe in you.

2659
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:47,950
I believe in...

2660
03:18:47,950 --> 03:18:48,170
You.

2661
03:19:02,520 --> 03:19:03,600
I'm dead now.

2662
03:19:05,400 --> 03:19:06,880
Anyway, thank you guys.

2663
03:19:07,080 --> 03:19:07,720
Thank you so much.

2664
03:19:07,940 --> 03:19:08,720
This is a lot of fun.

2665
03:19:09,060 --> 03:19:10,520
I will see you next time we play...

2666
03:19:10,520 --> 03:19:11,820
How far am I in?

2667
03:19:11,960 --> 03:19:14,100
I actually don't know how long this game is at all.

2668
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,180
So...

2669
03:19:16,180 --> 03:19:16,560
I think...

2670
03:19:17,160 --> 03:19:19,100
How long to beat said like...

2671
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,720
12 hours of...

2672
03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:22,340
Wait, maybe I'm thinking of a different game.

2673
03:19:22,480 --> 03:19:23,020
I don't remember.

2674
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:26,500
Like a quarter?

2675
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:27,440
20%?

2676
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:28,360
Okay.

2677
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:30,040
Not far at all.

2678
03:19:30,040 --> 03:19:30,440
Okay.

2679
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:31,360
Cool.

2680
03:19:31,980 --> 03:19:33,060
Because I'm having fun.

2681
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:35,340
So glad you're loving it.

2682
03:19:35,420 --> 03:19:36,660
It's one of my favorite games to replay.

2683
03:19:36,760 --> 03:19:37,960
I try to at least once a year.

2684
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:39,140
Certified Mito Gaming.

2685
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,420
Thank you!

2686
03:19:43,300 --> 03:19:44,060
Cool, cool.

2687
03:19:44,180 --> 03:19:45,100
First act done.

2688
03:19:45,180 --> 03:19:45,860
Let's go!

2689
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:48,280
Yippee!

2690
03:19:50,700 --> 03:19:51,820
Not even half.

2691
03:19:52,100 --> 03:19:52,800
Okay, cool.

2692
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:54,940
Has 18 chapters.

2693
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,720
That's like when we get the little title, right?

2694
03:20:04,640 --> 03:20:06,760
I don't even know how many we've gotten.

2695
03:20:09,060 --> 03:20:10,020
Was it fun?

2696
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:11,260
It's so much fun!

2697
03:20:11,480 --> 03:20:14,180
I'm gonna keep playing next week.

2698
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:15,320
Yes, yes, yes.

2699
03:20:16,280 --> 03:20:16,820
Osamito!

2700
03:20:17,280 --> 03:20:17,840
Thank you everybody.

2701
03:20:18,040 --> 03:20:19,880
See you when I see you next!

2702
03:20:20,740 --> 03:20:21,520
Bye-bye!

2703
03:20:21,980 --> 03:20:22,840
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

2704
03:20:23,500 --> 03:20:24,480
Thank you for watching!

2705
03:20:24,580 --> 03:20:25,560
Thanks for hanging out!

2706
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:26,660
Bye-bye!

2707
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:48,200
Nemi is still playing Elden Ring, so I'm going to...

2708
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:50,140
Raid into her.

2709
03:20:52,500 --> 03:20:53,260
Lucky!

2710
03:20:53,440 --> 03:20:55,100
I always forget to raid.

2711
03:20:56,600 --> 03:20:59,060
So I'll raid into Nemi Nightmare!

2712
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:00,820
Yippee!

2713
03:21:01,580 --> 03:21:02,000
Yeah.

2714
03:21:03,060 --> 03:21:04,300
Tell her she's cute.

2715
03:21:04,700 --> 03:21:05,160
Lucky!

2716
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:06,780
Bye-bye!
