1
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,060
Hi, we're already in the collab.

2
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,240
Oh, I, you can't hear their voices right now.

3
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,660
But I will, I will, I will unmute them now.

4
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,820
And we're gonna join.

5
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,080
That was kind of nice.

6
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,980
Oh, what's it called?

7
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,880
It's a collab.

8
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,160
So you can see them too.

9
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,080
If you have no pupils, will I join you?

10
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,700
Are we joining?

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,660
Are we joining?

12
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,860
Wait.

13
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh, password.

14
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,360
Okay.

15
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,120
I join.

16
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,760
Perhaps.

17
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,580
Password.

18
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,080
What's the magic word, guys?

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,740
What if you don't have pupils?

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,580
What if none of us have pupils?

21
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,120
Yeah, we should all do it.

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
We should all do it.

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,100
Join Peek.

24
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,540
Whose username is Peek.

25
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,700
Peek.

26
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,980
Peek.

27
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,260
Peek.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Wow.

29
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,220
Wow.

30
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,380
Oh.

31
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,700
You're huge.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,260
Come on.

33
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Whoops.

34
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,860
Whoops.

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:32,480
Let me just uh, oh my god Oh my god

37
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,870
Mimi?

38
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,090
Oh, you know...

39
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,630
Wait, wait.

40
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,050
Oh, that's part of it.

41
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,010
Oh, he doesn't...

42
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,470
He'll give context.

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,290
I'll give context for my chat.

44
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,330
This is what Mimi looked like when I first...

45
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,990
When we first tried the room...

46
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,370
On my...

47
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,570
On my screen.

48
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,770
This is... Wait, oh, it did better now.

49
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,330
Oh, good.

50
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,470
Yeah, you're good.

51
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,190
It's good.

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,890
Oh, yeah.

54
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:35,270
I think there's a bunch of stuff, like your inventory is here, and then there's like your health and stuff here, so maybe like the middle would be the best spot.

55
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,030
Nice and close, nice and close, yeah.

56
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,810
Oh yeah.

57
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:52,950
Oh my god.

58
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,170
Where's Monty?

59
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,010
Monty, I have no idea.

60
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,430
I don't know where I went.

61
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,690
It shows that you went over here.

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,570
Yeah, you zoomed that way.

63
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,030
Yeah.

64
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,730
Come back.

65
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,510
What the?

66
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,930
Come back to us.

67
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,130
Come here.

68
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,790
Come back.

69
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,390
The Lord have mercy on us.

70
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm struggling.

71
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,550
I can go.

72
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,850
Okay.

73
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,250
It's because she's tall.

74
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,370
Where the hell is the bagel?

75
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,570
We're going to leave it and then I'll come back.

76
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,630
Oh, okay.

77
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,130
This is real.

78
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,310
Oh, this just shows the VTuber scuff.

79
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,190
What's so new?

80
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,450
And it's all new.

81
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,050
There's no scuff.

82
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,210
No scuff.

83
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,790
No scuff.

84
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,250
No scuff at all.

85
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,110
No scuff at all.

86
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,450
We're perfectly fine.

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,770
Everything's in your head.

88
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,230
It's perfectly fine.

89
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,350
But Mimi still got eyes on my screen.

90
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,330
No.

91
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,470
She went this way again.

92
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:48,830
Oh, she went this way again.

93
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:48,910
Oh, I saw it.

94
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,650
I saw it.

95
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,190
Yeah, she went.

96
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,090
She went.

97
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,710
I'm back.

98
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,290
Why are you all the way this?

99
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,590
Okay, Mama, can you try something for me?

100
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,210
Uh-uh.

101
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,250
Can you grab yourself and start sliding left?

102
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,050
Yeah, just keep going.

103
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,250
It's a little...

104
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,010
She needs an eye patch.

105
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,570
It's a little gore, yeah.

106
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,050
Oh, Mama, it's in an eye still.

107
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,910
Everyone looks great for me, surprisingly.

108
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,630
I'm shocked.

109
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,030
You know what?

110
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,830
That might be good.

111
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,730
Chosen child.

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,330
God.

113
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,950
Here, let me take a picture for what I see.

114
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,750
Oh, yeah.

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,430
Cheese!

116
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,790
I'll be your eye.

117
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,250
Oh, so sweet!

118
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,570
Oh, whoa, wait, you can be the pupil.

119
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,550
Wait, that's kind of...

120
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,810
Yeah.

121
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,030
Don't worry about it.

122
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,830
Okay, there.

123
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,330
Ta-da!

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,590
Oh, yeah, everybody looks normal for you.

125
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,550
Yeah.

126
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,650
Interesting.

127
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,150
Oh, I don't know.

128
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:49,930
I feel bad.

129
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,290
That's okay.

130
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,130
Moni's looked better on my stream before.

131
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,190
She can look like this now.

132
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,650
It's okay.

133
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,890
We all have bad days.

134
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,530
Just one bad day.

135
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,630
It's kind of a look.

136
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,950
I think, yes.

137
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,310
I think I'm good now.

138
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,190
We cannot do this if it's too beefy.

139
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,930
It's, listen, my computer, I bought her about five years ago.

140
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,370
Have it cleaned her.

141
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,190
She's struggling a little bit, but, you know, country girls make this.

142
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,690
We still love her.

143
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,570
I don't think it's you.

144
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,450
I don't think it's you.

145
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,290
We still love her.

146
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,810
It's all right.

147
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,610
Okay.

148
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,170
Okay, well, are we gonna hide over here then?

149
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,790
I just need this to be handled with the game too.

150
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,570
Oh yeah, the middle.

151
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,250
Okay.

152
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,510
The middle.

153
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,530
The middle.

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,240
It looks like we're telling secrets.

155
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Hey, Manny, join us in the corner.

156
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Oh, oh, okay.

157
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,940
Was it y'all talking about me?

158
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,520
Telephone, telephone.

159
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,920
Men, tell me something.

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,000
I won't listen.

161
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,580
Uh...

162
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,460
Uh...

163
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,500
Uh...

164
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,660
Manny, you're kind of blocking the whole...

165
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,660
Your boobies are kind of in your way, Manny Bagel.

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Huh?

167
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh my.

168
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,760
Okay, uh...

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Okay, pass it down, pass it down.

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,660
Manny, are you ready, Manny?

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,040
Okay, good.

172
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,540
Yes, I'm sure ready.

173
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,260
Really?

174
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,860
No way.

175
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,320
Oh my god.

176
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,300
Don't say.

177
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,160
Holy shit.

178
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,740
Okay, I'm done.

179
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm done.

180
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm done.

181
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,620
Manny, you gotta come over here.

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,560

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,740

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,600

188
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,000
Classic telephone, pretty sure that's what...

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,540
Perfect.

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah.

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,200
Perfect though.

192
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,380
You missed a little part in my ear though.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Oh, what did I miss?

194
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
What did I miss?

195
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,520
What did I miss?

196
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
All right, about it.

197
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,740
It was, yeah.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,920
It was a small part.

199
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm so stupid.

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm so sorry.

201
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,620
No, no, no.

202
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,460
It's telephone.

203
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:32,780
It's hard.

204
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,660
I need to go back to school.

205
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
I need to go back to school.

206
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,100
So our vocabulary for this language.

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,920
Quit everything and climb a mountain.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah.

209
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,900
That's a wonderful idea.

210
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,180
Come to climb.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,560
Climb.

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:46,800
Climb.

213
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,460
Now is now a great time to tell you all, I've never once climbed anything in my life.

214
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,920
Never?

215
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,860
Not once?

216
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,260
I don't think so.

217
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,800
You've never climbed the charts in a video game.

218
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,160
What?

219
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,280
Go for it.

220
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,700
Oh, okay.

221
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,540
Okay.

227
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,440
Oh, God, the wind is so strong.

228
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,080
How did this happen?

229
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,380
Wait, what happens if I knock the mountain?

230
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,120
Ah!

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,100

Wait, can you hear me in the game?

318
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,390

319
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,770
You can't?

320
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,190
No.

321
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,070
Uh-oh.

322
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,210
Uh-oh.

323
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,790
Can you invite me again?

324
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,070
I might have misclicked.

325
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,790
I'm real.

326
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,570
I don't worry, you Southern Bell.

327
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,770
I'll do anything for you, my sweet apple pie.

328
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,530
Amani, have you speaking in your normal voice once yet?

329
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,890
Yeah.

330
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,250
What do you mean my normal voice?

331
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,110
This is my normal voice.

332
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,370
I don't even know what it is.

333
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,510
I've never spoken differently.

334
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:44,910

336
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,730
Oh, nothing bad can happen in a plane.

337
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,370
Right, right, right, yeah.

338
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,370
Unless I'm only piloting and I'm not really good at that.

339
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,290
Did you know that there are more likely to be car crashes than plane crashes?

340
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,910
So theoretically you are safer in a plane than you are in a car.

341
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,910
Thank you very much.

342
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,810
Yo, you just cured my anxiety.

Whoa, whoa, where are you putting your hands, lady?

348
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,590

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,210

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,670
I think we should take some off of her.

358
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,930
Hey, hey, hey, wax your hand away from me.

359
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,770
Stop that.

360
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,290
Stop that.

361
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:00,990
Stop that.

362
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm gonna get away from my badges.

363
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,990
I worked very hard to earn.

364
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,950
Oh, oh, oh.

365
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,730
Oh, whoa.

366
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,690
Wait!

367
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,670
I can hear you.

368
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,090
Oh, I hear you too.

369
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,890
Hey, princess.

370
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,950
How are you doing today, princess?

371
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,670
Can I help you get to the top?

372
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,350
Oh, yes.

373
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,250
I'm gonna help you get to the top, are you?

374
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,950
Oh, no one has ever told me that before.

375
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,290
Princess, can we get you to the top, princess?

376
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,970
I think we're all developing some type of weird character that we're doing.

377
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,730
Maybe this is, we needed the role play all along.

378
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,430
Maybe that's what this is.

379
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,850
It might just be.

380
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,070
It might just be.

381
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,890
Should we just mute ourselves in the game then?

382
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,750
That's what I was thinking.

383
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,350
Maybe we'll just...

384
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,710
I'll do push to talk.

385
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,130
It's okay.

386
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,850
It's okay.

387
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,650
Yippee!

388
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,450
Your character looks so cute.

389
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,370
Yeah, so ready for exploration and...

390
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,330
Yeah, look at that pose, that demeanor.

391
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,830
Everything about it.

392
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,630
Oh, thanks.

393
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,250
Thanks, princesses.

394
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,630
I'm so excited to go on this mountain with you.

395
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,230
Let me see.

396
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,370
I'm going to practice.

397
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,110
It looks kind of like we're trying to strangle each other.

398
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,830
Oh, I'm hanging.

399
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,950
Oh, oh, oops.

400
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,570
You look a little traumatized, princess.

401
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,890
I told you, I'm scared to fly.

402
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:27,530
Wait.

403
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,270
How do you...

404
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,330
I think this might be smart.

405
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,010
But I like the best smart idea.

406
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,310
Hold on, wait.

407
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,350
Oh, hey.

408
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,630
Suckers, I'm going the fast way up.

409
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,350
What?

410
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,210
You can make it!

411
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,590
Oh, God!

412
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:41,870
Oh.

413
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,850
All right, hold on.

414
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,650
I know.

415
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,890
I'm going to make it this time.

416
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,850
Come on, Dolly Parton.

417
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,610
You got this?

418
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,530
Jolene.

419
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,870
Dollyane.

420
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,530
Oh!

421
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,030
I did it.

422
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,270
Help me out.

423
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,370
Help me out.

424
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,190
Help me out.

425
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,070
How do I grab you?

426
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,350
Wait.

427
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,270
Hold on.

428
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,370
Just jump.

429
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,710
A leap of faith.

430
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,230
Oh.

431
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:04,970
Oh.

432
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,630
Oh.

433
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,590
Oh.

434
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,670
All right.

435
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,370
That might have been my fault.

436
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,170
I'm so sorry.

437
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,850
Come on up here.

438
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,170
Ow!

439
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:14,610
Oh.

440
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:15,930
Safe.

441
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,870
So how does one climb something?

442
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,050
Oh.

443
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,390
You just click on it and climb, baby.

444
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,310
It's instinct.

445
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:27,790
Oh.

446
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,450
Oh, I'm seeing that.

447
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,010
Yeah.

448
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,670
It's instinct.

449
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,610
It's instinct.

450
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:32,990
It's instinct.

451
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,610
It'll take over you.

452
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,470
I fear we might be cooked.

453
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,610
No.

454
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,890
Nah.

455
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,790
Lion does not concern himself with falling.

456
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,470
I helped you out.

457
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,730
Thank you!

458
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,130
Oh my god.

459
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,310
How do you push people?

460
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,970
You can win?

461
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,150
Huh?

462
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,590
How do I push people?

463
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,210
Shut up.

464
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,510
Shuffle, shuff, shuff, shuff.

465
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:04,690
Oh no.

466
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,170
Shuff.

467
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,850
Goodbye, princess!

468
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,510
Please help me.

469
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,770
I'm...

470
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:11,890
Oh!

471
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,950
Grab my hand!

472
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:14,950
Oh!

473
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,840
We're gonna figure this out.

474
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,040
We might figure this out.

475
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,660
Just jump!

476
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,160
Oh!

477
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,640
Yeah!

478
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,440
Oh!

479
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,500
I think you did it all on your own.

480
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,680
I know.

481
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
I think I needed you.

482
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,780
No.

483
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,380
I needed you.

484
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,220
You got that climber spirit.

485
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,320
Oh, I just pushed you!

486
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,420
Oh, I pushed you!

487
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
No, no, no, no.

488
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,860
Oh, he's on me, really.

489
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,860
Dive.

490
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,060
Dive is a cold, sad, lonely death.

491
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,500
Dive.

492
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,660
I think we're ready, team.

493
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
Yeah, I think so, too.

494
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,080
We could possibly go wrong.

495
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,540
Yeah.

496
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,760
We've been training for this for so long.

497
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
Oh, Miss Money.

498
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,820
I heard you're scared of planes.

499
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,840
I could maybe hold your hand while we're on the flight or something.

500
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,820
You want to hold my hand, Minto?

501
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,580
I'm also so scared.

502
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Oh, I'm so scared.

503
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,940
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,120
I have two hands.

505
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
You're a little clammy right now.

506
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,040
Group hand holding.

507
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,140
Oh, my.

508
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
I like the colors.

509
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,220
Yeah.

510
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,360
We're like inverted Powerpuff Girls.

511
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,700
You all have very soft skin.

512
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,440
Oh.

513
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,500
I lotioned.

514
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,120
Start.

515
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,840
Are we doing B-fall difficulty regular?

516
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,500
Yeah.

517
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,360
That sounds good.

518
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,800
Alrighty.

519
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,820
Okay.

520
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,060
Here we go.

521
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,100
Launching.

522
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,920
So I got a BBL yesterday and they told me that my ass is too fat to fly.

523
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,900
I hope it doesn't cause any problems.

524
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
Oh, I'm sure it won't.

525
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm sure we'll have a great flight.

526
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,740
In fact, that's a delight for us.

527
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,200
Thank you.

528
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,100
Yeah, of course.

529
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,060
Oh, God.

530
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,200
Whoa, what just happened?

531
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,980
Oh, God.

532
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,840
Her BBL, it was her BBL.

533
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,520
Oh, my God.

534
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,820
I'm so sorry.

535
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,180
I'm so sorry.

536
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,360
Man, you have way too fat of an ass.

537
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,620
This is unbelievable.

538
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,320
I told you.

539
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,000
I told you all!

540
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,240
I should have jumped first.

541
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
You know, we could have landed in the water.

543
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,320
You would have floated from your cheeks.

544
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,080
Oh, true.

545
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,100
Oh, play that thing, girl.

546
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,440
Play that thing, girl.

547
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,580
Oh!

548
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:20,860
Oh!

549
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,860
Oh, you're so musical.

550
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah.

551
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,380
So musical.

552
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,040
She's really good.

553
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,740
Oh, yeah.

554
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,300
She's really good.

555
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,520
He's really good.

556
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,340
Who's a bing bong?

557
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,340
That's that guy.

558
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,180
That's that guy.

559
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,220
You want bing bong?

560
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,260
I don't want bing bong.

561
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,520
Wait, whose backpack is this?

562
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,760
He looks like Duolingo.

563
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,080
Duolingo.

564
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,440
It does look like Duolingo.

565
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm going to spend a lot.

566
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah?

567
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,620
Yeah.

568
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,260
Give me a beat.

569
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,820
Give me a beat.

570
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,500
Oh, okay, okay.

571
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Ugh.

572
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,780
We crash because of mints.

573
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,540
BBL.

574
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,460
Where the hell are we?

575
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,800
We're gonna die.

576
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,300
The end.

577
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,820
Bang.

578
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,420
Song of the summer.

579
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,480
I'm coming.

580
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,380
I'm telling you guys.

581
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,940
We're gonna be a hit.

582
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,080
Oh yeah.

583
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,600
Stupid book!

584
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,640
Who reads anyways?

585
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,560
I could eat it maybe.

586
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,560
You think that would help?

587
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,200
You could try if you'd like to.

588
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,000
Don't watch.

589
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,580
It's embarrassing.

590
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,260
Oh, okay.

591
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,960
Let me look away.

592
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,340
You're right.

593
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,420
I'm so sorry.

594
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,340
Hey, watch where you...

595
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,520
Look at your face.

596
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,520
Hey, watch where you're going, dude.

597
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,340
I'm harassing me.

598
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,020
Did anyone else notice that Monty Bagel disappeared from the screen?

599
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,500
Yeah, we're having a few issues.

600
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,580
We're just having a few issues.

601
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,620
What do you see with those?

602
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,320
What do you see with those, huh?

603
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,960
You see anything special?

604
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,000
I see.

605
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,920
It's like...

606
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,800
It's...

607
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,140
Wow.

608
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,260
It's amazing.

609
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,200
She said no, chat.

610
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,340
She said no.

611
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,600
Because words can't describe.

612
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,660
Oh.

613
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,020
Yeah.

614
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,280
It's better.

615
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,280
Are you gonna use that rope and pull me in or something?

616
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm gonna lasso your heart.

617

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,200
no, no, you won't die.

619
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
You'll just fall and it'll hurt a lot.

620
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,780
No, you'll die before it even hurts, so...

621
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,160
Oh!

622
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,680
Yeah.

623
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,800
You seem to have experience with it.

624
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
There are many different ways to look at life.

625
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,100
Actually, I beat this game with...

626
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,680
Wait, really?

627
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,280
Assistance.

628
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,540
So you are the carrier with...

629
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,000
So you got carried?

630
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, do.

631
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,180
Well...

632
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,420
Do.

633
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,080
Yeah.

634
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,160
Do...

635
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,260
Dull.

636
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,620
Yeah.

637
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,320
I have, I found the kids cuisine on, in that luggage right there.

638
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,540
It looks, it looks like it might have been sitting for a few years, but I figure if y'all are good, I can, I can give y'all a little bite.

639
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,740
Maybe one bite per day, per person.

640
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
You have any expired baloney?

641
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,460
Uh, yeah, it seems like I do got some in here, actually.

642
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,100
I like the, the, the, the, yeah, the pudding.

643
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,740
Yeah, me too.

644
00:28:59,780 --> 00:28:59,980

647
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,380
She thinks fine.

648
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,240
Oh, she...

649
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,040
No, that's normal.

650
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,780
That's normal.

651
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,580
Oh, is it part of the process?

652
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,380
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:39,880
It's normal.

654
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,260
It was just a little poison.

655
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,980
No worries.

656
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,600
Please don't get poisoned, please.

657
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,980
Oh, yeah.

658
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,560
Grab my hand.

659
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,560
Thank you.

660
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,480
Oh, no.

661
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:49,920
Oh, no.

662
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm getting lethal company flashbacks from this.

663
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,240
I'm going to die.

664
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,580
No, you got this.

665
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,100
I got you.

666
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,060
Give me...

667
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,260
Oh.

668
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,760
Hey, don't worry about it.

669
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,940
It seems that two of the ducklings lack some feathers on their wings.

670
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,940
Oh, what did you just say?

671
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,460
I think.

672
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,240
Look at how she's looking at us.

673
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
You called me.

674
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,340
A featherless duck.

675
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,700
You heard me.

676
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,780
You heard me.

677
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,840
Over there.

678
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,440
I'm sorry.

679
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,960
You better run.

680
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,740
You better run.

681
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,120
I think the poison's taken over.

682
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,220
Oh.

683
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,580
There she is.

684
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,520
There she is.

685
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,540
Dude.

686
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,700
Come on, little purple gal!

687
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,080
Something about this game don't really like me!

688
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,920
The fog is coming!

689
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,420
The fog cometh!

690
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,760
The hole?

691
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,100
Who is coming?

692
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,580
The fog cometh.

693
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,780
You think I would probably... I should have probably done some research on how to play this game.

694
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,380
I'm coming, baby!

695
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,180
Oh, oh, good lord.

696
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,940
Oh, you were so close!

697
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,480
Saw your little purple head.

698
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,260
Go up the rocks individually.

699
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,860
Like, look, follow my ping.

700
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,020
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

701
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,720
Bing, bing, bing, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink.

702
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,060
Okay, if you want to try, we can try to pick you up from here.

703
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,520
Yeah, I got my hand outstretched ready.

704
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,840
And I'm holding your butt so you don't fall.

705
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,400
Oh, thank you.

706
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,960
Okay.

707
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,700
All right.

708
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,680
All right.

709
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,720
All right.

710
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,260
Oh, you're getting real slow.

711
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:22,740
Yeah.

712
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,440
Yeah.

713
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,500
Come on.

714
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:24,960
Go!

715
00:31:27,320 --> 00:32:25,080

Listen.

719
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,000
We were very close.

720
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,120
I'm nothing if not resilient.

721
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,360
I will tell you what.

722
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,020
Look at me.

723
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,900
Up at me.

724
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,180
Up at me.

725
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,200
Look at me.

726
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,780
Oh, come on.

727
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,900
You did it.

728
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,500
You did that.

729
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,900
You did it.

730
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Don't touch that.

731
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,080
Oh, my butt.

732
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,700
Come, come.

733
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,460
Oh, I can help you hold that if you want to hold that up.

734
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,880
Come, come.

735
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
the purple...careful the purple...

736
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh, come come!

737
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,300
Oh, oh.

738
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,480
Oh, come, come!

739
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,740
Oh, come!

740
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,720
Oh, I got you.

741
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:01,840
Oh, yeah!

742
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,160
There we go.

743
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,380
Come, go.

744
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,420
Listen, listen.

745
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,100
I'll get the hang of it.

746
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll get the hang of it.

747
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't worry about it.

748
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah, you'll get it.

749
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,500
Yeah, you'll get it.

750
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,480
Which would be a good way to go.

751
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,840
Maybe over here.

752
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,420
Oh.

753
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,660
I was trying to scout a little bit.

754
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:16,740
Oh.

755
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,380
Oh, yeah, this might be a better place.

756
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,680
So, sound.

757
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,600
The fog… I don't know if I heard that.

758
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,100
I got a boss.

759
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,800
You got a boss?

760
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,340
The fog is coming, the fog coming.

761
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm scared.

762
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,560
Baby, I'm scared.

763
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Don't be scared.

764
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,740
You have eyes to protect you.

765
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,400
You have like a fan or something that's dog-proof, perhaps.

766
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,640
A fan.

767
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I have my breath.

768
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,120
I can go...

769
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,060
That might work.

770
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:46,860
Okay.

771
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,080
Give me your hand.

772
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:48,980
Nice.

773
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,940
It's working, it's working.

774
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,720
Oh yeah, Manny, really show that.

775
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,200
Nice.

776
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,440
All right, this is real dangerous.

777
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,400
Y 'all y'all see this slope right here?

778
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:01,960
Uh-huh.

779
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,120
I'm so scared.

780
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,220
It's about a 448 degree slope that's real difficult.

781
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,520
448 maybe.

782
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,080
I don't think the degrees don't go that high.

783
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,320
No, it goes that high.

784
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,440
I got a degree in that.

785
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,460
I got a degree in degrees.

786
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,140
She got a degree.

787
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,780
And degrees.

788
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,620
And degrees.

789
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,600
The fog!

790
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,120
Oh my.

791
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,420
I smell it.

792
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,880
He's cooking.

793
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,300
What is that?

794
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,940
Oh, did anyone get the backpack?

795
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,800
Whoopsie, I don't think anybody brought them.

796
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,580
I didn't get it that bad.

797
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,380
It's alright, we don't need it anyways.

798
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,700
We're too good at this game.

799
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Oh, I got a chubby shroom.

800
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm gonna eat it.

801
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,260
What happened to me?

802
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,220
Do you feel dizzy at all or anything?

803
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,160
No, actually, it's great.

804
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,760
Everybody eats the chubby shroom.

805
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,600
Okay.

806
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,300
Yeah.

807
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,280
I'll trust you.

808
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,740
I'll trust you on that, maybe.

809
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,640
The fog is getting good.

810
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,180
If Mint tells me to do drugs, I'll do it.

811
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,420
It's nice.

812
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,820
It's natural, holistic.

813
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:54,940

Kill a fellow.

816
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,240
But not this one.

817
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,720
It's good.

818
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,540
Yes.

819
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,360
Oh, you're so talented.

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,460
You're doing great, darling.

821
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,580
Thank you.

822
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,980
I think we're getting too far to the side of the map, though.

823
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,180
We got to go back a little bit.

824
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,420
I think.

825
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,740
We got to circle in this way.

826
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,320
Green is nice.

827
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,880
We got to start heading over there, maybe.

828
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,400
Oh, thanks.

829
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,940
All right.

830
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,370
All right.

832
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,830

By ticks?

837
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,410
Omani, you got to see it again.

838
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,370
I'm coming back.

839
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,730
It's okay if it's too hard.

840
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,390
My computer being from 8,000 years ago, one of the first computer prototypes, I think.

841

Are you able to rejoin or?

I loved it, Picasso.

862
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,530
That was good practice.

863
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,550
Good practice, yeah.

864
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,710
Wait, my chat's saying you could rejoin.

865
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,170
Oh.

866
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,970
Well, it's a little too late for that.

867
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,770
It's okay.

868
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,030
Well, well...

869
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:29,830
Uh...

870
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:30,810
YOLO.

871
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,470
Okay.

872
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,610
Let me...

873
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,490
Let me do a little funny and invite her again.

874
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:39,970
Hold on.

875
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,330
Okay.

876
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,530
Yeah, it might be better if y'all bring the worm in, if you know what I mean.

877
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,290
I'll bring the worm in, don't you worry.

878
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,530
It might be better to bring the worm in, yeah.

879
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,590
We can bring the worm in.

880
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,350
Who's the worm?

881
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,430
Oh, the worm!

882
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,790
Yeah, okay.

883
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:04,730
Yeah, I don't want anybody to be alarmed by my appearance, but sometimes I have to do this.

884
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,590
If you can't accept you at your worst, you know.

885
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,030
Yeah.

886
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,410

Look at it.

00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,910
I'm looking real nice today.

00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,750
I did my makeup especially for this.

894
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,100
Oh, I wonder if I can rearrange these.

895
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,860
You know, I think...

896
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,690
No, this is great.

00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,990
B-B-B-B-B-L.

903
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,190
Big, big, big.

904
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,530
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa.

905
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,290
Are you, oh.

906
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,830
Uh, the flare is kind of going crazy, isn't it?

907
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,250
Let me see.

908
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:13,990
Let me see.

909
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,730
Whoa.

910
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,990
Oh, it's dancing.

911
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,730
Man, I'm going to be real honest with you.

912
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,750
I think your doctor might have scammed you, honey.

913
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,270
It's looking real flat today.

914
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,410
Flat!

915
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,210
I think you sat on it too much, honey.

916
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:27,950
Oh, God.

917
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,330
Oh, God.

918
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,130
No, no.

919
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,710
Y 'all, we're gonna have to take her back.

920
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:31,210
Wait, let me see.

921
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,570
Let me look in the mirror.

922
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,590
Let me look in the mirror.

923
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,990
Okay, well, actually this is the normal before it was concave.

924
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,450
So actually, oh, you know what?

925
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,990
That's an improvement, actually.

926
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,790
You can take a bite of my worm tail.

927
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,210
It's got a lot of protein, so it might help it grow too.

928
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,830
I'm a growing girl.

929
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,770
Is Mint a grown girl, yes or no?

930
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:55,930
Yes.

931
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,550
I'm not sure.

932
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:57,610
What?

933
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,210
Oh, bing bong isn't too sure about that.

934
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,510
Ask again, ask again.

935
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,390
No, you can't ask the same question.

936
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,830
The answer has been spoken.

937
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,630
It might be confused because you're short.

938
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,550
Yeah, yeah.

939
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,450
How tall are you?

940
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,450
Very, very tiny, very tiny, short.

941
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,710
Is she short?

942
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,570
Yeah, she's super tall.

943
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,870
Okay, okay, okay.

944
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,950
Let's ask another question.

945
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,450
Somebody else, go ahead.

946
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,910
What am I going to eat for dinner?

947
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,890
Yeah.

948
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,310
Yeah.

949
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,950
Well, I got a question.

950
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:34,750
Okay, go ahead.

951
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,470
You can squeeze it.

952
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,930
Do the honor.

953
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,430
Do it fart.

954
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,790
If I say it.

955
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,850
Oh, yeah.

956
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,990
Squeezed it twice.

957
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,590
All right, we got this is the concise answer, Bing Bong.

958
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,350
Do it fart.

959
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,290
No.

960
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:56,550
No.

961
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,170
No.

962
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,430
I think you embarrassed him.

963
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,790
He said yeah at first.

964
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,630
Bing Bong, do you want to live?

965
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,070
I don't know how to squish him.

966
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,950
How do you squish him?

967
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,010
Uh, left corner.

968
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:07,330
Sure.

969
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,810
Oh, he does want to live.

970
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,210
He doesn't sound very sure about it.

971
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:12,350
Kill him!

972
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,610
Fire in the fire!

973
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,690
Oh shit, I killed myself too in doing that.

974
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,610
Jesus Christ.

975
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,370
Don't step in the fire.

976
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,270
Hey, don't step in the fire.

977
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,170
It's quite hot.

978
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:21,790
Oh, is it real?

979
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:22,250
The fire?

980
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,650
Oh, he's tweaking a little bit.

981
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,530
How do I use this?

982
00:44:28,550 --> 00:45:28,730

I appreciate the honesty, honestly, I really do.

985
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:34,990
People are hungry.

986
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:35,730
Thank you.

987
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,710
Wait, there's some here too.

988
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,690
You're quite welcome, ladies.

989
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,810
I think there's a lot of short on short, friendly fire going on in between the two of you.

990
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,650
What are you talking about?

991
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,070
What?

992
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,130
No, we're both like eight feet tall.

993
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,110
You can't even talk about it.

994
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,730
Yeah, I've grown since this last conversation.

995
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,630
I think red is safe.

996
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,550
Yeah.

997
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,410
Guys, we all know Mani is the shortest here.

998
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,050
Of course.

999
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:07,230
Unless we're eight feet tall and Mani is one foot tall.

1000
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,450
Wait, how do I use the backpack?

1001
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,110
Because you're like a bagel bite.

1002
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:12,490
Uh-huh.

1003
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,210
Bagel bite.

1004
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,010
Energy drink.

1005
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,410
Where'd Minto go?

1006
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:17,830
I'm here.

1007
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:18,770
Sorry.

1008
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,190
Hi.

1009
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:20,850
I'm coming.

1010
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,510
Snake is here.

1011
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,190
Snake is here.

1012
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:22,970
He's right there.

1013
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:23,850
He's right there.

1014
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,670
He's right there.

1015
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:24,950
Right there.

1016
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,190
In the bush.

1017
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:26,970
In the bush.

1018
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,410
Wait, right here, this bush right here quickly!

1019
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:29,650
Oh!

1020
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:30,410
Oh!

1021
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:31,050
Oh!

1022
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,290
Oh!

1023
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,550
Wait, I'm out of stamina!

1024
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:34,270
Oh!

1025
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,030
You found it!

1026
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,350
Oh!

1027
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,290
Oh no!

1028
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,010
Silly legs.

1029
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,150
Silly legs.

1030
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:40,670
Okay.

1031
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,550
Uh, there's nothing there.

1032
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,350
I suppose he went to the top already.

1033
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,650
Gotta find him.

1034
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:47,270
Gotta get down.

1035
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,150
We gotta get there.

1036
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,150
That's the goal.

1037
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,170
That's he's there.

1038
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,010
You two can become Charlotte Snake.

1039
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:54,850
Snake.

1040
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,310
We can become him?

1041
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:57,530
Probably.

1042
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:58,290
Oh.

1043
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,590
No one can equate to that greatness.

1044
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,410
I don't know if you want to do that.

1045
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,430
Okay.

1046
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,870
All right.

1047
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,010
Upsi daisy.

1048
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,970
I think we can just go the same way we went before.

1049
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:11,270
Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,610
Nothing will go wrong with that at all.

1051
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,750
Hey, guys, there's some fruits down there if anyone's interested, but I don't know.

1052
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,490
These rocks are treacherous.

1053
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,950
Oh, nice jump.

1054
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:25,870
I'm here.

1055
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:26,950
Oh, I'm here.

1056
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,150
Thank you.

1057
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,030
To grab anybody by their hair.

1058
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:32,550
Come, come, come.

1059
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,750
Oh, thank you so much.

1060
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,670
Thank you.

1061
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,230
Oh, I didn't even notice you pulling my hair like that.

1062
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:39,970
Oh, thank you.

1063
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,210
Pull in your hair, your luscious body.

1064
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:43,150
Body?

1065
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,250
Body!

1066
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,790
Grab my phalanges.

1067
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,950
Oh, there we go.

1068
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,290
Oh, the phalanges.

1069
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,370
All right, y'all.

1070
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:50,910
Yes.

1071
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,310
We're all speaking in southern now.

1072
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,550
I've infected everybody.

1073
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,730
It's true.

1074
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,110
You did indeed.

1075
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:58,890
You did indeed.

1076
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,330
Hold on.

1077
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,710
My normal voice.

1078
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,490
This is how I normally sound.

1079
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:03,590
What?

1080
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,270
No, no.

1081
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:04,970
I don't know.

1082
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,310
Y'all all said while we're Monty Bagel earlier.

1083
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,370
I think it's just the first.

1084
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:08,850
Oh yeah, I forgot.

1085
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,990
I'm Monty Bagel.

1086
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,990
What if I, what if we switch it up and we start talking in a different accent?

1087
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:14,790
What?

1088
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,670
Hello everyone.

1089
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,730
Hello everyone.

1090
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,430
Are we now British?

1091
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,210
Oh, we're British now.

1092
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:20,930
We're British now.

1093
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,230
It's tea time, isn't it?

1094
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,010
Which one of you has took a fucking share, forgot to forge the toilet.

1095
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,870
Disgusting!

1096
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,550
Disgusting!

1097
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:29,790
Disgusting!

1098
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,090
Disgusting!

1099
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:37,010
Hi, I'm Becky G and I'm gonna sing Share Lloyd by Share Lloyd.

1100
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,270
By Share Lloyd.

1101
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,250
Into the bee.

1102
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:39,690
Where are we going?

1103
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:40,170
Into the bee.

1104
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,770
Into the bee.

1105
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,090
Bum.

1106
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,670
Whoa, I got a nice view right now.

1107
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,370
That's crazy.

1108
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,570
Where are you looking?

1109
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,830
There were three of them right in front of me.

1110
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,510
I couldn't help.

1111
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:55,830
Um...

1112
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:56,210
Oh.

1113
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:56,950
Oh.

1114
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,910
Wait, there's some...

1115
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:59,130
What?

1116
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,650
That's so ominous.

1117
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,910
I know, it's scary.

1118
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:02,650
Oh no, baby!

1119
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,550
Ow!

1120
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,230
No!

1121
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,670
Who wants some trail mix?

1122
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:07,850
I got it.

1123
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,370
I got it.

1124
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:08,830
I'm good.

1125
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,190
I got you, baby.

1126
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,810

1127
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,870
Come in me, you hungry?

1128
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,070

00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,510
No doubt at all.

1141
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:33,670

1142
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,090
Pinkie Pie.

00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,190
Oh, yes.

1145
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:44,590

Yeah.

1147
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,690
No, that's Vivi with her eyes.

1148
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,110
Yeah.

1149
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,310

1152
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,670
There's some food.

1153
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,910
I'm going to take it.

1154
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,710
You know what pony you would be.

1155
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,310
I don't know.

1156
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,210
What do you think?

1157
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,030
Applejack.

1158
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:45,930
Thought it was obvious.

1159
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:46,750
Applejack.

1160
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,950
Well, it makes all the sense imaginable.

1161
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,690
How do I put it in my bag?

1162
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:54,590
I don't know.

1163
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,750
I'm holding on to stuff, I don't know how to put it in my backpack.

1164
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,130
Uh, you gotta place the backpack down, my darling.

1165
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,610
What?

1166
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,830
You gotta place the backpack down, darling.

1167
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:07,750
Oh, I do?

1168
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,310
Yes, you do.

1169
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,470
Oh, no.

1170
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,070
And you dropped it.

1171
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:12,670
Oh, no.

1172
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:13,330
Oh, no.

1173
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,050
Oh, no.

1174
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:14,470
The apple.

1175
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,410
Don't drop the backpack.

1176
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,690
I don't think it's worth it.

1177
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,550
Is there any more?

1178
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,090
There's more.

1179
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,630
There's more.

1180
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:21,670
Oh.

1181
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:23,250
Good job.

1182
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,770
Okay, okay.

1183
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,850

Alrighty then.

1186
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,290
I can't stop climbing though.

1187
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:55,950
Oh.

1188
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:56,890
There we go.

1189
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:57,610
That's fine.

1190
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,050
Oh.

1191
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:58,910
Oh.

1192
00:52:59,330 --> 00:52:59,490
Oh.

1193
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,090
More to the right, my dog.

1194
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:02,690
Hold on.

1195
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,870
It's telling me.

1196
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:04,530
It hates me.

1197
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,890
Yeah.

1198
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,850
It keeps yelling at me too.

1199
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,410
Okay.

1200
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,710
To the right.

1201
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,490
To the right.

1202
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,170
Yay.

1203
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,430
Hopefully that's better for the, for you guys.

1204
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:14,970
Yeah.

1205
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,430
For the chatters.

1206
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,290
For the chatters.

1207
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:17,630
Yeah.

1208
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:18,330
Yeah.

1209
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:18,690
Yeah.

1210
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:18,770
Yeah.

1211
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,690
Oh.

1212
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:20,770
Oh, that looks spiky.

1213
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,290
He looked quite scared of it.

1214
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:23,630
Ew!

1215
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,410
I'm not scared of nothing.

1216
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:25,810
Watch.

1217
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,950
I don't think we can go that way.

1218
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,210
Can we?

1219
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,090
Watch me.

1220
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,950
There's nothing we can't do.

1221
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,090
Yeah, yeah.

1222
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:32,770
I believe you.

1223
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:33,550
I believe you.

1224
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,030
We've got to...

1225
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,350
You can do it.

1226
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,210
I mean...

1227
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,090
I'm very...

1228
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,170
I'm very...

1229
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,550
I think I made it.

1230
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,350
I made me.

1231
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:49,870
I'm holding my hand up.

1232
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,850
Don't make me die, darling.

1233
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,610
Don't let me die.

1234
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:52,670
Come on.

1235
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,130
If it tells you to shift, do shift.

1236
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,470
Shift!

1237
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,150
Yeah, I am.

1238
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:56,890
Thank you.

1239
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,450
I think we're almost to the top.

1240
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,170
I have no idea.

1241
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,810
Yeah, me too.

1242
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:00,410
I think so.

1243
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,730
I think we made it practically.

1244
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,770
In fact, we might be setting a world record right now.

1245
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,530
You never know.

1246
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,610
This game's easy.

1247
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:08,610
Oh!

1248
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,630
Yeah, totally, totally.

1249
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,490
Which way should...

1250
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,730
Oh, can we make that?

1251
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:15,490
Oh, you guys can.

1252
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:15,850
Okay.

1253
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,670
I'm just following the crowd, if I'm honest.

1254
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:23,430
I haven't made a single decision this whole run.

1255
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:23,970
That's okay.

1256
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,850
It's looking real good over here, I think.

1257
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,370
Oh, whoa.

1258
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,390
All right.

1259
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,330
Oh, this is going down.

1260
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,030
This is good.

1261
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:33,790
This is good.

1262
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,850
I see a man-made structure.

1263
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,810
A bridge of some sort.

1264
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,610
A bridge.

1265
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:40,970
Civilization.

1266
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,910
I was hoping it was going to be like a cafe or something.

1267
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,570
Oh, I have food if anyone needs some food.

1268
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,930
Oh, it's okay.

1269
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:50,630
It's a nightmare.

1270
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,230
I'll save it for it.

1271
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,350
I would like some.

1272
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,110
You want some?

1273
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:54,950
Yes.

1274
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,270
Can you feed it to me?

1275
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:57,870
Open wide.

1276
00:54:59,450 --> 00:54:59,710
Whoa.

1277
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,630
I'm watching something so intimate.

1278
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,550
You got a big mouth, little lady.

1279
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:06,710
Yes, I do.

1280
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,710
It's like Kirby.

1281
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,530
It's like Kirby.

1282
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:11,510
It just sucks everything.

1283
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:12,150
Yeah.

1284
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,870
Oh, my.

1285
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:15,570
Uh-oh.

1286
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,670
Uh-oh.

1287
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,410
Okay, I'm good.

1288
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:18,650
Yes, maybe.

1289
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,710
Oh, uh...

1290
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,550
Oh, baby!

1291
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:22,970

1292
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:23,930
We're fine!

1293
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,090
Good job, everybody!

1294
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,490
Yeah, we're killing it!

1295
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,670
This is working out so spectacularly.

1296
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:30,370
Spectacularly.

1297
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:32,710
Spectacularly...

1298
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,890
Spectacularly...

1299
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,630
Spectacularly, giggly.

1300
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,650
I'm following you, Mani.

1301
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,610
I'm following you.

00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,990

Oh!

1307
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,250

00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,070

The campfire!

1312
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:21,630
Oh my god!

1313
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,470
Do you smell the burning wood?

1314
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:38,510
You see that?

1315
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,130
It's like a sleeper agent.

1316
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,430
We buried it!

1317
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,030

Wait, are we like goaded or something?

1321
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,810
I think so, actually.

1322
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,190
Cookies?

1323
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,930
Everybody get you a marshmallow.

1324
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,310
Yeah, everybody gets a marshmallow.

1325
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,130
A marshmallow.

1326
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,130
Thick mints!

1327
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,170
Oh, I got one of these already!

1328
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:04,210
Yeah.

1329
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:05,770
I got one of them.

1330
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,630
My BBL.

1331
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,830
With her double BBL.

1332
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,250
Yeah.

1333
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,450
Oh, tropics.

00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:12,230
Oh.

1335
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,630
Um, um, I want to feed this to somebody.

1336
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:15,190
I don't...

1337
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,490
Manny, do you want to feed each other?

1338
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:17,710
Blushes a little bit.

1339
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,550
Slicks my lips.

1340
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,270
a little bit.

1341
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,650
Okay, um...

You fed me the stick!

1343
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,290
Does anyone need any more food?

1344
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,910
I think there might be more food in this.

1345
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,650
Wait, who wants to touch the ancient statue?

1346
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,230
That sounds like it'll kill me.

1347
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,270
Okay, I'll do it.

1348
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,370

00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,310
Is it cure-all?

1354
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,670
It's the green juice.

Which way should we go?

1386
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,550
I don't know.

1387
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,550
We gotta get back up.

1388
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:18,910
We went all the way down.

1389
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,870
Alright, let's see this way.

1390
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,610
These spiky trees look a little spiky, I won't lie.

1391
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,370
You don't want to touch them.

1392
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:27,870
Ow.

1393
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,570
As I touched one.

1394
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:29,830
Oof.

1395
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,810
Does this look like a good way to go?

1396
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,490
I can't tell.

1397
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:35,050
Whatever.

1398
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:36,050
Yeah!

1399
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,750
That little square there looks real friendly.

1400
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:40,690
Ugh.

1401
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,550
Oh my god.

1402
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,890
You like my sheer muscle?

1403
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,050
Yeah, that was pretty impressive.

1404
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:50,770
Oh, impressive.

1405
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,770
Oh, yeah.

1406
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,290
Oh, yes, I'm just too good.

1407
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,890
She can't stop winning.

1408
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,350
Can't stop silly.

1409
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:00,630
This is looking real frightening, y'all.

1410
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,890
I don't know about this.

1411
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:03,050
Oh, God.

1412
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:04,430
I don't know about this.

1413
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,410
Look at my spiky.

1414
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,510
Oh, what are those?

1415
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,410
What are those?

1416
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,770
Whoa.

1417
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,090
Oh, that's your hand.

1418
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,730
Did you go to my ping?

1419
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,950
Yeah, I was like, oh, what is that?

1420
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:20,650
Oh, what is?

1421
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:27,030
Okay, team, do we go A or B?

1422
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,330
A or B?

1423
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:31,910
B.

1424
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,630
B for bagel.

1425
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:34,750
Yeah, B for bagel.

1426
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:35,650

01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,770
B, bagel.

1428
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:37,970
B.

1429
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:40,070
Alrighty.

1430
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,290
I'm climbing.

1431
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,430
Don't mind the rain.

1432
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:43,790
That's a little...

01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,110
We're basking in the funk.

1437
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,250
I persevered.

1438
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,130
I climbed through.

1439
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,430
Hey, you still got a bottle of that Kirol, maybe?

1440
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,210

01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,770
No, I'm gonna... We're gonna save it.

1442
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:31,890
Oh, wait, how bad are you?

1443
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:32,990
It'll go away.

1444
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,850
Don't worry about it.

1445
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,050
Alright, it'll go away.

1446
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:35,810
You're right, you're right.

1447
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,110
I ended up really high up.

1448
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:37,930
I don't know where I am.

1449
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:40,930
Wait, uh...

1450
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:41,190
Oh, oh.

1451
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:41,730
Ah!

1452
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:42,310
Oh!

1453
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,110
I don't think I can make it up there.

1454
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,310
You can do it, you can do it.

1455
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,790
You gotta wait for the poison to go down, darling.

1456
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,610
Oh, does it auto go down?

1457
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,070
It does.

1458
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,650
You just have to wait for it a little bit.

1459
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:54,890
Oh, that's nice.

1460
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,390
Wait, I can offer a hand up here, perhaps.

1461
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,330
Is this your own attack?

1462
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,230
Let me wait for my poison to go down.

1463
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,030
I like the thought, baby.

1464
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,170
I'm gonna eat it.

1465
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,950
Wait, I'm gonna give this to you.

1466
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:10,490
Manny.

1467
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,450
Take it.

1468
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:11,850
Oh, God.

1469
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:12,430
Jesus.

1470
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:14,310
or not.

1471
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:15,490
It might help you though.

1472
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,010
Does it help?

1473
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,110
Oh.

1474
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,370
Oh, it hurts!

1475
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,670
Sorry, I should have tested it!

1476
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,570
My princess!

1477
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:27,690
I should have tested it!

1478
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,950
Wait, put the banana peel down?

1479
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,570
I'll show you something funny.

1480
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:34,730
Oh!

1481
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,090
Oh, oh, oh!

1482
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,990
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1483
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,470
You're gonna have a whip I throw it at you.

1484
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:41,590
Oh!

1485
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,210
Oh God!

1486
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:42,770
I'm sorry!

1487
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:43,210
Oh!

1488
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,510
Oh my god!

1489
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,010
Oh my god!

1490
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,630
Oh my god!

1491
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:51,850
You know, this sounds really interesting when you don't know what's going on down there.

1492
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:53,710
That's what I was thinking.

1493
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,990
She slipped on my nanner.

1494
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,490
Let me show you something funny.

1495
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,050
I have.

1496
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,550
She opened my nanner and slipped on it.

1497
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,110
What?

1498
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:06,950
That's true.

1499
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,390
Is she, huh?

1500
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,070
You are what?

1501
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,070
Maybe we do use the cure-all.

1502
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:12,850
Nanny!

1503
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,710
Darling, I don't think that's very safe.

1504
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,230
Let's head up there.

1505
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,990
Let's head up there so they can get over here.

1506
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:19,650
Okay, okay.

1507
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,210
My poison that- oh, it's going down a little bit.

1508
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:23,310
Why?

1509
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,610
It's like very slow.

1510
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,510
We're- yeah.

1511
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,130
Okay, hold it.

1512
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:27,650
We're holding.

1513
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,790
We'll make it out of this.

1514
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,770
We'll make it out of this.

1515
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:31,730
I'm real scared.

1516
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,730
You know, at the beginning I said I got anxiety and it's just really off the charts right now.

1517
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,450
I'm real scared.

1518
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,710
No, no, don't be scared.

1519
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:38,730
Yeah, don't be scared.

1520
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:39,910
Here, I'm gonna go.

1521
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,010
Honestly, your BBO was worth it.

1522
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,370
It's looking good from this angle, honey.

1523
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:43,670
Is it?

1524
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:44,850
I really hope so.

1525
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:45,730
Yeah, it's looking real good.

1526
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,170
It's not concave at all.

1527
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,310
Oh no.

1528
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,910
Oh no, if you guys didn't help, I can't come back down.

1529
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,110
Let me come back down.

1530
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,170
Let me mosey my way back down there so I can grab your hands.

1531
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,630
We're struggling a little bit.

1532
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,170
All right.

1533
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,070
One more time and I'll grab your little fingers.

1534
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:03,850
Bandage.

1535
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,250
Come this way, I'll help you guys.

1536
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,010
Oh.

1537
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:13,610
Ah!

1538
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:14,890
Ah!

1539
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:15,090
Ah!

1540
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,490
Why did that not work?

1541
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:21,150
Okay, okay, okay, one of you.

1542
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,110
One of you.

1543
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,370
Hey, hey, one of you down there.

1544
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,130
Okay.

1545
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:26,570
What is that?

1546
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:26,810
Oh.

1547
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,670
I want to stay out of the way so there's room to climb up.

1548
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,050
I got it.

1549
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:31,070
I got it.

1550
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,410
Take it.

1551
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,270
It'll help you climb up.

1552
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,010
Okay, Manny, you want to try getting up here?

1553
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,070
Yeah, yeah, I think I can do it.

1554
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:36,450
Okay.

1555
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,350
Do you guys need any food?

1556
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,570
Reach your phalanges out.

1557
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:39,150
I'm coming.

1558
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,310
My phalanges are right here.

1559
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1560
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,250
Make sure to grab them nice and tight and squeeze them.

1561
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,030
I'm going to grab them real good.

1562
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:45,410
I'll go.

1563
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,570
Maybe if you eat, do you guys have food?

1564
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,670
I've got food to give you if you need it.

1565
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,810
I got this...

1566
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:56,530
Alright, oops, sorry.

1567
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,110
We're gonna use the cure all.

1568
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:04,030
Do you need... We've got red berries up here, quite a few of them in fact.

1569
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,350
If they cure all, they'll be fine.

1570
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,890
I'm curing me.

1571
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,710
I'm curing you.

1572
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:11,650
Did that cure?

1573
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,610
The fog is rising.

1574
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,450
And we still got something.

1575
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:45,910

I thought you almost slipped.

1577
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:47,990
No, we're okay.

1578
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:48,910
We're okay.

1579
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:49,630
You can do it.

1580
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:50,310
Thank you.

1581
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:50,850
All right.

1582
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,890
Let's go.

1583
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,550
It's the BBL.

1584
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:01,870
You know, you didn't hurt yourself at all because it kept falling on your cushion.

1585
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:02,750
Yeah.

1586
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,470
I've never had that before.

1587
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,470
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1588
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,830
I have a surprise for you guys making it up here.

1589
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,070
Malibu!

1590
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,350
Wow!

1591
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,970
Oh, please, please, can I have a lick?

1592
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:15,450
Just a lick.

1593
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,190
Lick the communal lollipop.

1594
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:19,610
The communal lollipop.

1595
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,970
Oh, oh, oh.

1596
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,830
I think you had the whole entire thing.

1597
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:23,450
You were hungry.

1598
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:23,950
Oh, my.

1599
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,670
Dude.

1600
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:25,630
But, hold on.

1601
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:26,110
Growing.

1602
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:27,170
Growing, girl.

1603
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,450
I can't see straight right now, dude.

1604
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,710
Dude, stuff that lollipop was laced with something, dude.

1605
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:35,170
No, you're like glowing right now.

1606
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,230
You're like glowing.

1607
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,110
It would never do anything like that.

1608
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,730
It would never waste anything.

1609
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,290
You're doing great, darling.

1610
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:44,990
Oh.

1611
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,370
I was about to say, look out!

1612
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,870
Come, Pentee.

1613
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,290
Make your way up here.

1614
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:51,890
Oh, I like the color it makes.

1615
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,210
It matches your hair, Camila.

1616
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,010
I think we should stay down here for a moment, Pentee.

1617
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,610
I'll have you know something.

1618
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:58,210
Yeah.

1619
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,770
I didn't step in something.

1620
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,490
I farted.

1621
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,010
She farted!

1622
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,550
She farted!

1623
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:04,690
What?

1624
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:07,390
What?

1625
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,710
Camila farted.

1626
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:09,450
What the hell?

1627
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,650
You farted.

1628
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:13,970
Wait, where do we go from here?

1629
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:14,490
Uh-oh.

1630
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,230
I'm not quite sure.

1631
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,770
There might have been a brief miscalculation.

1632
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,110
No, no, no.

1633
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,110
Let's try going this way a little more.

1634
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:23,590
Aki.

1635
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:24,050
Oh.

1636
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,310
Just to see.

1637
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,330
Just to see.

1638
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,510
We didn't miscalculate anything.

1639
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:29,490
This way, maybe?

1640
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,130
I don't know.

1641
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:30,890
Stinky.

1642
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,070
What's that right there?

1643
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,870
Are the bugle mushrooms saved or the budded mushrooms saved?

1644
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,510
I don't think the ones with the spots are...

1645
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:45,150
Yeah, the ones with the spots are bad news bears.

1646
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:46,670
Yeah, bad news bears.

1649
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,070
You'll be fine.

1650
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,510
I passed out.

1651
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,390
I passed out.

1652
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,510
Oh, buddy!

1653
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:58,890

1654
01:09:59,290 --> 01:09:59,830
Oh, no.

1655
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,270
What do we do?

1656
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:01,610
The stench.

1657
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,530
You'll come back, right?

1658
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:03,070
I'm awake.

1659
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,650
Oh, you're good.

1660
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:04,570
You're awake.

1661
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,050
Walk it off.

1662
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:06,690
Walk it off.

1663
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,330
Walk it off.

1664
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,810
The stench was too much.

1665
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,550
I'm sorry.

1666
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,390
It's them cupcakes that I had earlier.

1667
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:16,090
I'm so sorry.

1668
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:20,030
Oh, I think I have enough cure-all for one more.

1669
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,450
Monty Bagel might need it, I think.

1670
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:24,430
Who?

1671
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,110
Yeah, yeah.

1672
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,650
Yeah.

1673
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,010
All right, Monty, coming out.

1674
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:28,810
Thank you, sure.

1675
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:29,310
Yeah.

Yeah, that helped, that helped.

1679
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:35,310
Yeah.

1680
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,790
That took a little bit off, the little of the edge off, right?

1681
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,070
Yeah, it took a little bit of the edge off.

1682
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:45,930
I think it was like, oh, I was needed, okay.

1683
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:49,870
Guys, something crazy just happened.

1684
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:50,230

1685
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,410

01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,770
Positive reinforcement.

Yeah.

1732
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:56,970

Watch out.

1738
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,210
There's big stanks.

1739
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,370
Oh, good number bar.

1740
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,070
And a sports drink.

Oh, boy.

1742
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,190
The fog is coming.

1743
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,970
Yeah, we gotta keep moving.

1744
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:17,750
What is that?

1745
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:18,730
I got a balloon.

1746
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,070
Oh, cute!

1747
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,510

1748
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,870
It's a balloon!

1749
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:24,690
Oh!

It's so cute!

1753
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,270
We can't lose baby now.

1754
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:33,210
Don't touch it.

1755
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,590
Watch the spikes, watch the spikes.

1756
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:35,070
Oh!

1757
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:37,250
Don't pop it!

1758
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,170
Oh no.

1759
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:42,850
This is like when you take a baby to the grocery store.

1760
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:43,690
Or grandma.

1761
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,890
What?

1762
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:47,290
Baby, grandma, same thing.

1763
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:48,670
Huh.

1764
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,530
We can maybe go like this there.

1765
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that looks good.

1766
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:53,770

1767
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:55,470
Oh, wait.

1768
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:56,090
Which way?

1769
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:56,670

01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,130
Oh, this way?

1771
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,030

01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,050
Like, like this way.

1775
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:03,390
Which way?

1776
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:03,790
What way?

1777
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:04,430
This way?

1778
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:04,730
Maybe.

1779
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,770
Oh, that way?

1780
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:06,810
Is that a way over there?

1781
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:12,340

Touching you.

1791
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,670
Sweet Caroline.

Ba-ba-ba.

1793
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:06,530

Okay.

01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:48,330
Anybody.

1803
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,090
Grab over my paw!

1804
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:52,990
Oh, you went down.

1805
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:54,110
Okay, I'm on the way.

1806
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,340
Oh, my paw.

1807
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,320
Wait, are we at?

1808
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,140
Wait, I had you!

1809
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,260
What happened?

1810
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:02,460
Guys.

1811
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:03,320
Yeah?

1812
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,460
I'm not in a good...

1813
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,480
I'm not in a good way right now.

1814
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,280
What's wrong?

1815
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:11,490
Oh, wait.

1816
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,050
Don't die.

1817
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,150
The way Mimi's going is pretty good, I think.

1818
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:15,370
Maybe.

1819
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:15,890
I don't know.

1820
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,010
I did just almost fog my day.

1821
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,030
Um, Manny, you good?

1822
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:23,830
Um, yeah.

1823
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:25,090
Yeah.

1824
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:38,150
Wait, Manny, try one more time, okay?

1825
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:39,130
I got you.

1826
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,990
I'm gonna loop up my hand for you nice and...

1827
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,610
Oh, it's difficult.

1828
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,110
No, it's counterproductive.

1829
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,310
Oh, there we go.

1830
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,010
Oh, yeah!

1831
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,530
When in doubt, when in doubt, we move it.

1832
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,710
Wait, can we- we can keep going up, right here?

1833
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:51,370
I think?

1834
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,170
But probably.

1835
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,750
Maybe?

1836
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:53,130
Probably?

1837
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,130
Maybe.

1838
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,450
Hey, we haven't died yet.

1839
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,070
Yeah, I think there's a bit of, like, an inside route up here.

1840
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:00,250
It seems.

1841
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:01,190
Maybe?

1842
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,050
Well, I'm going to trust your mint stinks.

1843
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,670
How about that?

1844
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,970
I don't have- The mint stinks!

1845
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,630
Okay, don't follow me.

1846
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:08,630
Don't follow me.

1847
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,910
Don't follow me!

1848
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:11,410
Not following, not following, not following, not following.

1849
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:23,150
Darling, yeah, right over there sounds like I'm struggling a little bit.

1850
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,970
I'm stuck and I'm...

1851
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,350
I fell completely to the bottom.

1852
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,390
No!

1853
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:34,370
Wait, I have a rope.

1854
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:35,450
Can I use that?

1855
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,230
You think a rope would work here?

1856
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,230
Oh, yeah, maybe.

1857
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:45,390
How do I... Where do I... How... How do I do that?

1858
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:48,370
What are you here for?

1859
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,230
Why'd you come down here?

1860
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,690
Oh, I was muted.

1861
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:53,710
My deepest apology.

1862
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:54,830
Guys, come down here.

1863
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:55,330
Come down here.

1864
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:56,150
I have a better idea.

1865
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:56,670
Okay.

1866
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,110
Because this is a team.

1867
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,850
If one of us falls, we all fall.

1868
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,450
Vivi!

1869
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:04,170
Let's see.

1870
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:06,330
Oh, oh, oh.

1871
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:07,390
Oh, oh, oh.

Oh, I'm down.

Help me, help me, somebody, help me.

1889

Kill her, oh, shaman.

1894
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,890
Please heal her.

1895
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,330
Please heal her.

1896
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:49,950
Thank you.

1897
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,470
Oh my god, I can't believe that worked.

1898
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:53,510
Did it work?

1899
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,170
I'll go back over this way and get my bandit.

1900
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,650
How damaged are you, Mimi?

1901
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,630
Very.

1902
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:59,950
Uh oh, the fog is like pretty...

1903
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:00,730
I know it's a first day kit.

1904
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,490
Oh, wait, wait.

1905
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,890
Did we pick up the bandit over here?

1906
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:06,950
I used it on you, honey.

1907
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:07,830
Oh, okay.

1908
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:08,490
Right.

1909
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,010
Oh, thank you.

1910
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:12,710
helped a lot.

1911
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,450
I don't need it anymore.

1912
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,790
I do need food maybe though.

1913
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:16,610
That might be a help.

1914
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:19,310
Is anyone injured?

1915
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:21,610
Not anymore.

1916
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,450
Thanks to me.

1917
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,110
I'm gonna end just a little bit, but I don't need it.

1918
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:24,530
It's okay.

1919
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,530
Maybe we can climb... Wait, maybe we can climb this guy.

1920
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:33,370
Here, watch out.

1921
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:34,050
Watch out.

1922
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:34,850
Oh, yeah.

1923
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:38,690
Okay, uh, you're gonna have to tank some of this though.

1924
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:42,610
Wait, there's some fruit over here too.

1925
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:43,870
Hunggy people.

1926
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:45,270
Yippee!

1927
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,030
It's red.

1928
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,530
Red should be good.

1929
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,210
Give to me the yummy fruits and things.

1930
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,770
And we have trail mix and a bandage!

1931
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:55,570
Let's go!

1932
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,930
Alright, who wants to trigger the fart cloud?

1933
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,070
I don't think we need to trigger it, did we?

1934
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:06,370
We might be able to wait our way through.

1935
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,350
What if I go like this?

1936
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,410
Oh, we can just go around it here.

1937
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,670
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

1938
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:15,710
Oh, how did he oh no.

01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:16,690
Oh.

1940

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1941
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,510
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1942
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:48,550
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Banners with me to the bottom.

1943
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,490
Help!

1944
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:50,010
Help!

1945
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:50,530
Help!

1946
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:52,130
I

1947
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,690
watched you drop.

1948
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,660
Hey, I'm not dead though.

1949
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,780
I'm actually, I'm just, I'm just out.

1950
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,420
Is everybody out or dead or how we doing, do you?

1951
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,280
If you guys can get somewhere, go on by all means.

1952
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,360
Yeah, yeah, for real.

1953
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,420
Hey there.

1954
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,280
You look good.

1955
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,300
You guys look so silly.

1956
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,480
Oh, you're not doing so hot.

1957
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:38,740
Come, baby, get us to the drop.

1958
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,680
I'm not doing too well at all.

1959
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,380
Yeah, you're not doing so hot here.

1960
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,220
So as we were falling down, I found a vine and I grabbed onto it as we were falling down.

1961
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,440
Wait, actually, if you feed me, wait, if you feed me a banana, I'll live.

1962
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,260
Where are you?

1963
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,640
Oh, you're right where you were.

1964
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:57,520
Yeah, she was right.

1965
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,180
No, it's too late now, I think.

1966
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,900
Yeah, it's too, oh, it's gone.

The beef.

01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,480
The beef.

2031
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,720
The beef.

2032
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:32,600
Okay.

2033
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,480
One more.

2034
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,100
One more.

2035
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:34,440
Okay.

2036
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:34,880
One more.

2037
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:35,860
Oh, no.

2038
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:36,360
One more.

2039
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,040
Just one more.

2040
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:37,580
The cold.

2041
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,200
The cold cometh.

2042
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:40,920
No, no, no, no.

2043
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:41,940
No, no.

2044
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,020
What will it take for me to die?

2045
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,000
Whip and Nene.

2046
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,340
Yeah, Whip and Nene's for us.

2047
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,180
I have to pee very badly.

2048
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,140
It will be right back.

2049
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:03,760
Oh, go ahead, go ahead.

2050
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,260
Listen, nothing could have possibly gone better.

2051
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,420
That was truly, I think, the best.

2052
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,680
Yeah, it was really good.

2053
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,400
I think it's kind of rude.

2054
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,120
I think it's kind of rude that Camilla didn't take us with her to pee.

2055
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,600
but it's okay.

2056
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:23,840
I just like thought after everything we've been through today that we would be like close enough.

2057
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,300
Oh, so true.

2058
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:25,700
So true.

2059
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:26,440
Yeah.

2060
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yeah.

2061
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,860
We should really confront her when she gets... Yeah.

2062
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:30,760
Yeah.

2063
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,660
No, actually we should go meet her there.

2064
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:34,660
We should.

2065
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:35,860
Yeah, we should.

2066
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,020
I mean, I could go pee right now.

2067
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:41,860
I'll take you guys.

2068
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,700
Oh, okay.

2069
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:44,880
Hey, if you're offering.

2070
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,340
Okay.

2071
01:28:47,500 --> 01:29:02,620
Well, let me get on discord on my phone oh oh this all right oh i wasn't prepared to see it all the way through i don't know if i'm i was into the bathroom jinkle jinkle

2072
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:20,040
this is my my theory that vtubers always end up talking about p and i'm the one that started it this time this is oh you started every time i feel like well actually i don't technically Camilla said she had to pee, so...

2073
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,740
That's true.

2074
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:21,260
Yeah.

2075
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:21,960
Yeah.

2076
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,220
Yeah, yeah.

2077
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,780
Yeah, it wasn't me with her.

2078
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,240
It's the pink one's fault.

2079
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:26,740
Yeah, yeah.

2080
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:27,520
Always.

2081
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,080
It's why we're dead now.

2082
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:33,080
For sure, yes.

2083
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,080
No, that's not because I decided to jump off of a vine if I've heard of you to go up to the ground.

2084
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2085
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:38,560
No.

2086
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,240
I think...

2087
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,800
Did we all fall from that vine except for Camilla?

2088
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,200
I think so, yeah.

2089
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,120
You know, maybe it wasn't...

2090
01:29:48,140 --> 01:30:46,680
the smartest idea for all us to all just take that blindly but that just shows we're so close because we trusted each other yeah and look like god yeah we trusted each other so much we were like we're the best sister friends if one goes we all go except camilla because she exactly and friends die together yeah yeah if you jump off a bridge well i'm gonna catch you first but but if you fall i'm falling too you know yeah if someone said would you jump off a bridge for that person if they told you to i'd say hell yeah well yes i would in fact you're telling me mony camilla and minter at the bottom of this bridge i'm jumping i'm jumping back at the port oh why are we all Oh,

2091
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,100
this is so intimate.

2092
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,800
Small little elevator.

2093
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,340
Oh, I took her passport.

2094
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:57,940
Oh, no, I didn't.

2095
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,160
Oh, you're stealing her identity in real time.

2096
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:01,920
Yep.

2097
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:02,600
Huh.

2098
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:03,480

Hey, princess.

What's going on, princess?

2121
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:51,560
You have a bunch who owned it by two 160 centimeter gremlins before point size?

2122
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,100
What is 162?

2123
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,060
I don't know.

2124
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,880
I just assumed because that should have been said earlier.

2125
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,220
Yeah, actually, I'm 170 now.

2126
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,640

I'm 5-1 in freedom units.

2129
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:06,980

2130
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:08,120
Yes.

2131
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,200
Right, right, right, right.

2132
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,100
How'd you do that?

2133
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,580
Wait, what's the...

2134
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,600

2135
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:14,420
R.

2136
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,400

Oh!

2140

01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:52,270
If I'm also green.

2157
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:55,310
What are you talking about, darling?

2158
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:56,230
The green against green crime.

We're friends.

2163
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,770
We're all in this crash together.

2164
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:06,230
It doesn't matter who started it.

2165
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:09,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2169
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,370
How really?

2170
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,390

Whoa, we have so many balloons!

Yeah, I needed them.

2175
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:27,050
You know, it was getting stressful climbing these mountains, you know?

2176
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,410
Yeah, yeah, totally.

2177
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:30,070
It helps me relax.

2178
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,090
How not to die?

2179
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,290
Wait, there's an actual book.

2180
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:36,030
Never abandon a friend in need.

2181
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2182
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:39,510
Oh, it's just how to play this game.

Wait, there's actually...

I have a lot of anger in my soul.

2190
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,850
I need to get it out.

2191
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:23,470
No, no, no.

You want to go next.

You can't catch me.

2194
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:27,950
You can't catch me.

2195
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:28,310
No, no, no.

2196
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:29,810
Calm down, Quintex.

2197
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,010
Oh, gosh.

2198
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:31,650
Oh, right.

2199
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:32,390
The jugular.

2200
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:34,970
Oh, she caught it.

2201
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:35,430
Oh, God.

2202
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:36,230
I got it.

2203
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:37,010
I got it.

2204
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,490
You better run, darling.

2205
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,670
You better run.

2206
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,970
Serpentine and world are scary.

2207
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:46,310
Oh, shit.

2208
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,990
Hello.

2209
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,870
Oh god, no, she's got it again.

2210
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:50,490
Everyone run.

2211
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,090
Now I'm gonna do nothing with it.

2212
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:54,550
I just want to keep it for purposes later.

2213
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:55,670
Sure fine, darling.

2214
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:56,250
Sure fine.

2215
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:02,070
I bet I dare you to touch this thing, Camila.

2216
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,030
This.

2217
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:04,050
Eh?

2218
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:04,670
Touch it.

2219
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:05,550
What the heck is that?

2220
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,670
And why should I?

2221
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:07,670
Touch it.

2222
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:08,670
Touch it.

2223
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,390
I'll have her do it.

2224
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,570
Hey, you should touch it, Mimi.

2225
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:13,790
Touch it, Mimi.

2226
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:14,750
Touch it, Mimi.

2227
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:15,910
Get closer, nice and close.

2228
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:16,450
Yeah.

2229
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:17,450
Yeah.

2230
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:19,510
Ah!

2231
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:21,310
Clumsy!

2232
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:21,890
Oh!

2233
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:25,070
Butterfingers over here!

2234
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,030
Hit her while she's down!

2235
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:29,730
Hit her while she's down!

2236
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:32,190
I'm gonna get you for that one, Miss Blago!

2237
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:32,470
Ah!

2238
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,970
I got some rope.

2239
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:40,150
That's okay.

2240
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,950
No matter what, I still have Bing Bong.

2241
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:43,390
Bing Bong.

2242
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:46,130
Bing Bong will always save us.

2243
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:50,330
How do we know how to get through this one, but we don't I don't know how to get to the next one.

2244
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:54,310
Maybe the next one we should just go like a totally different route.

2245
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:58,450
I feel like our route was kind of like a little iffy from the beginning.

2246
01:36:58,850 --> 01:36:59,590
No, no, no.

2247
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,750
There's nothing wrong with any of the decisions that we made.

2248
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:03,650
Never doubt yourself.

2249
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:04,750
Um.

2250
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:08,690
I've never doubt yourself, princess.

2251
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:11,710
Pointers.

2252
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:14,330
Is that thing gonna get old?

2253
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:18,050
Oh no, I don't even know how you guys are doing that, princess.

2254
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:20,570
It's like mine doesn't sound right.

2255
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:23,810
I can't do it.

2256
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,690
I can't do it.

2257
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,030
Thank you.

2258
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,870
I wish you'd thank you for the ring.

2259
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:30,030
Cove your poinsettias.

Your next poinsettias.

2262
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:34,330
Okay, poinsettias.

2263
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:36,570
The big jump.

2264
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:38,150
The big leap.

2265
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,450
Yes.

2266
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,470
Oh my gosh, this is great.

2267
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:45,550

01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:26,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2273
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:27,570
Toilet.

2274
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:31,370
Totally, totally, don't worry about it.

2275
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:32,930
Don't even worry about it, princess.

2276
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:33,890
Don't even worry about it.

2277
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:35,350
Okay.

2278
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:40,810
Like, I'm a goat.

2279
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:42,870
I'm a wall walking.

2280
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:48,170
Wait, you can walk on 90-degree walls like a goat.

2281
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:51,350
Yeah, that's why they call me the goat.

2282
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,210
Oh, that makes so much sense.

2283
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:56,130
I'd be wall walking.

2284
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:01,830
I'm doing, I'm making bad decisions right now.

2285
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:03,250
I just want everyone to know.

2286
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:05,290
I believe in you.

2287
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,390
I don't know where I am.

2288
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:11,590
I don't think it's where I need to be.

2289
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:16,550
Oh, was that what was in there, the trumpet?

Is she alive?

2292
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:53,930
Yeah.

2293
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,830
Or I could kill her.

2294
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:58,970
And then...

2295
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,790
Oh, this is not the way.

2296
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:00,570
Don't follow me.

2297
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:01,510
Oh, great.

2298
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:05,090
I've made bad decisions, princesses.

2299
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,290
Are you okay?

2300
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:07,350
Are we all good?

2301
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:10,010
I don't know where I am, actually.

2302
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:13,750
We've climbed this twice now.

2303
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,030
We might have.

2304
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:18,170
I think...

2305
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:20,210
I think y'all are on the right path over there.

2306
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:21,410
We are?

2307
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:21,990
Yeah.

2308
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:22,710
I don't...

2309
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:23,590
I think I...

2310
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:24,550
Well, maybe...

2311
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,970
Well, shit.

2312
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:25,410
I don't know.

2313
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:26,310
I think so.

2314
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:26,750
Wait.

2315
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:27,290
Oh, gosh.

2316
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,090
Oh, oh.

2317
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,770
Oh, thanks, Camilla.

2318
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:30,930
Oh, oh.

2319
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:31,590
Oh, oh.

2320
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,390
Oh.

2321
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,810
Were we not, darling?

2322
01:40:34,990 --> 01:40:36,570
I figured it out.

2323
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:39,690
You found it?

2324
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,290
Man, I think with every flight we're having, like, the air pressure is decreasing.

2325
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:48,170
I mean, that's...

2326
01:40:48,750 --> 01:41:48,830
it's getting concave i hate to tell you no you know they get a little concave again they said that might happen they were like just don't they were like don't take too many flights especially if they crash they warned you and you didn't listen i didn't oh but we now we gotta go back oh yeah that's what actually what this trip is for this is what i went through to get the first you know what here i got this we can probably put that in there oh yeah like one that'll be one cheek fill that up that's what they mean with like an apple bottom you know apple bottom yes exactly and it's only in one cheek so we'll figure out the other cheek maybe we can put the frisbee in the other one yeah i don't think anybody would mind if it's a little lopsided might be a little asymmetry is beauty it's a new trend of asymmetry is beauty yeah yes like boobies putting put in Yep.

2327
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:53,510
Oh, like the bunny challenge, the...

2328
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,530
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2329
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:55,850
The chubby bunny.

2330
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:56,990
Chubby bunny.

2331
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:57,610
Chubby bunny.

2332
01:41:57,710 --> 01:41:58,510
But with apples.

2333
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:01,490
Um, guys, I think it's over for me.

2334
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,770
What?

2335
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,030
Where are you, baby?

2336
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:04,930
I don't know.

2337
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:07,730
I've been so locked in, I didn't even realize.

2338
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:09,970
No, no, it's okay.

2339
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,710
Can you see my hand?

2340
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:14,410
Uh...

2341
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:14,910
No.

2342
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:15,590
Oh.

2343
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:16,790
Oh.

2344
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,110
I see...

2345
01:42:18,970 --> 01:43:16,030

2346
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:25,090
I don't know if I'm going the roadway, but I know I'm going.

2347
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,570
I'll have a will and a way.

2348
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:29,030
So there is a way.

2349
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:29,470
Yeah.

2350
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:30,210
You can do it.

2351
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:33,090
I believe in you with all of my believingness.

2352
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:36,650
Oh, okay.

2353
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:38,110
Ooh.

2354
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:40,210
What's this?

2355
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:41,770
Explorers luggage.

2356
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:44,410
I can get...

2357
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:45,710
What's a scout cannon?

2358
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,230
What the heck is this?

2359
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:47,530
Oh.

2360
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:49,870
You could shoot someone out of a cannon.

2361
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,530
I grabbed it.

2362
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:54,610
Wait, can I actually?

2363
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:57,510
Wait, can I shoot myself out of the cannon?

2364
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:58,690
What is that?

2365
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:02,270
Okay, I'm going to try and get to the top with the cannon.

2366
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:03,310
Oh, God.

2367
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:03,730
Okay.

2368
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:06,310
I've got a great view if it goes wrong.

2369
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,150
Oh, I place it the wrong direction.

2370
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:09,330
Oh, no.

2371
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:12,250
That'll send you careening off the side of the cliff, I fear.

2372
01:44:14,110 --> 01:44:17,430
Oh, I accidentally put it the wrong way.

2373
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:30,490

For science.

2376
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,920
It beckons.

2377
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,400
Where is Camilla?

2378
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,280
I'm over here.

2379
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,880
I honestly have a lot of faith that Camilla can make it.

2380
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,820
Yeah, I do too.

2381
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,580
Oh yeah, it's easy peasy.

2382
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:39,420
I think you have to touch the statue to bring us to life.

2383
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,400
Oh, dokey dokey.

2384
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,180
That statue, I'm gonna touch it.

2385
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,740
You're gonna rub all over it?

2386
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,120
Yeah.

2387
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,360
Oh, Jesus.

2388
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:49,900
I'm a little cursed.

Yeah.

2391
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,540
I wish I brought my binoculars.

2392
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:55,800
Yeah, that'd be nice.

2393
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,640
Well, I can't decipher nothing.

2394
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,920
Me thinks the opposite of what we did last time.

2395
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:07,660
Yeah?

2396
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:08,780
That sounds good.

2397
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:09,140
Yeah.

2398
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,020
Don't.

2399
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:17,120
What if we go, like, straight through this clearing and just straight up the rock all the way to the top?

2400
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:17,960
What?

2401
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:19,500
Wait, what?

2402
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,520
I just need to say something to y'all.

2403
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:26,100
Before we go on to this adventure, I just noticed everybody's doing this southern accent.

2404
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,500
Now, listen, I welcome it.

2405
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:27,900
Come on.

2406
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:28,420
Come on.

2407
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:28,920
But.

2408
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:30,580
I need.

2409
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:30,920
Oh.

2410
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:31,860
Oh, no.

2411
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,640
Are you okay?

2412
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,580
I'm just fine, darling.

2413
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,120
Now, I just need...

2414
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,440
I got to ask y'all a question.

2415
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,780
I want you to be real honest.

2416
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,300
Yeah.

2417
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,320
What do you call...

2418
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,520
And Mimi, you know the answer.

2419
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,560
You're not allowed to answer.

2420
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,360
Oh, okay.

2421
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,940
What do you call the things in shopping carts that you move your groceries around?

2422
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,420
Shopping car?!

2423
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,040
In gross case.

2424
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,360
Yeah, what do you call that?

2425
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,140
What do you call the shopping cart?

2426
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,020
Yeah, yeah, what do you call it?

2427
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:01,400
A buggy.

2428
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:02,180
No!

2429
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:03,560
How did I do that?

2430
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,100
How did you know that?

2431
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,920
How did you know that?

2432
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,060
That is insider knowledge.

2433
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:13,000
No, that's Monty Bigel you're talking to.

2434
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,820
Of course Monty Bigel we know that it's called a buggy.

2435
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,720
Oh yeah, it's called a buggy.

2436
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,660
Of course Monty Bigel we know that.

2437
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,460
B-G.

2438
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:28,020
You know how much I got clowned on that after I moved out of like the deep south and I said buggy and people were like what the heck?

2439
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,220
What the hell is a buggy, darling?

2440
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:29,900
No way!

2441
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,340
What the heck is a buggy?

2442
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,100
Is that a southern thing?

2443
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:34,800
The buggy?

2444
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:35,800
Yeah.

2445
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:36,780
The buggy?

2446
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:37,680
The buggy?

2447
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,880
What is a buggy?

2448
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,620
It's a shopping cart.

2449
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:43,180
Oh, so it is a shop.

2450
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:47,240
Oh, I just need to wait to answer a little bit.

2451
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:48,820
Oh.

2452
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:53,600
The buggy, the buggy, the buggy.

2453
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,360
The buggy.

2454
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:54,880
The buggy.

2455
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,260
The buggy.

2456
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:58,260
Jump!

2457
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,300
I'm going through this hole.

2458
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,600
I'm gonna follow you through the hole.

2459
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,440
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

2460
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,020
Wait, there's a little pathway.

2461
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,260
You don't even have to like...

2462
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,420
You don't even have to work.

2463
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:11,520
You found the secret pathway.

2464
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,020
Yeah.

2465
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:13,980
Down.

2466
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:17,780
What if there was like a little thing here that said teleport to the top?

2467
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,000
I don't know if we can...

2468
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:23,080
get, I don't know if there's any ledges on the other side.

2469
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:26,200
We can try the banana vine a second time, that'll definitely work.

2470
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,560
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

2471
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:29,520
Over here, there's, well, I don't know.

2472
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:30,180
Pull on you, look.

2473
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,420
Yeah, yeah, come over here.

2474
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,440
Okay, look.

2475
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,500
There's a vine up there.

2476
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,820
Yeah, we're at the top.

2477
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:38,840
Oh, I'm seeing what you are saying.

2478
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:39,660
Point.

2479
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:40,780
Use your fingers.

2480
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,520
I don't know how to point.

2481
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:49,500
Use your middle mouse button muscle towards that muscle.

2482
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:50,660
You see that?

2483
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,160
This one?

2484
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:51,780
This one?

2485
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,360
Okay, okay.

2486
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,360
Oh, yeah, I see it.

2487
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:53,880
I see it.

2488
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,620
Well, now, hold on.

2489
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,440
Now, where do we go once we get up there?

2490
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,580
We keep going up.

2491
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,400
Just keep going up.

2492
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:02,520
Just don't question it.

2493
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:03,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2494
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:04,840
I'm going to grab it.

2495
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:05,340
I'm going.

2496
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:05,860
Come on.

2497
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,440
I don't know if we're going to do it.

2498
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,500
Come here, baby.

2499
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:10,080
Thank you.

2500
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:11,540
Oh, thank you, my darling.

2501
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,220
You're so kind of me.

2502
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,720
I think I'm going to watch first.

2503
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:14,520
Yeah, maybe.

2504
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,180
I'm going to jump.

2505
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,340
Oh, Jesus.

2506
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:19,500
Oh, I thought you were going to fall straight to the floor.

2507
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,580
I made it!

2508
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,540
Wait, you guys call it the floor or the ground?

2509
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,880
Um, both.

2510
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,080
Oh.

2511
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,720
I guess that's good.

2512
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:32,960
I got a road cam.

2513
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,920
I call it my platform, my stepping platform.

2514
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:37,860
My stepping platform.

2515
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,580
Oh, this area might be kind of difficult.

2516
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:43,540
Nah.

2517
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,000
There's another vine here that leads kind of downward.

2518
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:49,160
Wait, there's an ins- we can go in, maybe.

2519

01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:24,440
I see.

2525
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,400
Don't take risks.

2526
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:29,860
Don't take risks.

2527
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:31,420
I'm all about taking risks.

2528
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:33,240
Oh no!

2529
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,200
Oh my god.

2530
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:35,600
Okay.

2531
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,100
We've got actually worked out.

2532
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,160
Oh, we're just doing it.

2533
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:40,580
Okay.

2534
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:41,240
Coming well.

2535
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:41,740
Let's go.

2536
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,360
What the hell?

2537
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:44,760
But that's kind of going back to...

2538
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,440
Well, I guess we have to go that way, huh?

2539
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,360
Yeah.

2540
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:47,700
Yeah.

2541
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:48,600
Okay.

2542
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:50,600
Wait, what did you guys jump on to?

2543
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,300
Oh, this one.

2544
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:51,840
Do a flip!

2545
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,700
Oh, there's a vine.

2546
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:53,140
Okay.

2547
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:53,920
Yeah.

2548
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,180
And then there's a tree you can jump on to or something.

2549
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:57,740
Yeah.

2550
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,000
Yeah.

2551
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:00,720
Yeah.

2552
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,080
Yeah.

2553
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:02,140
Then how should you get up there?

2554
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,620
Okay.

2555
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,500
Um, does anyone have a band-aid, maybe?

2556
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,400
I have...

2557
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:11,640
No.

2558
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:12,940
Um...

2559
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:14,300
Oh, Mint, I have a present for you.

2560
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:15,500
For me?

2561
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:16,600
Yes.

2562
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,160
Oh, you got that out of it.

2564
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,160
This ain't so good.

2565
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,060
It screwed us.

2566
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:51,980
Yeah, this ain't so good.

2567
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:54,580
I'm sure it's fine.

2568
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:58,720
All you need to do is...

2569
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,180
Maybe we go try the other side.

2570
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:01,300
Yeah!

2571
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,240
Wait, does it randomly generate it every time?

2572
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,740
No, it's like randomly generated every couple of hours or something.

2573
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:08,740
Oh.

2574
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,300
Something like that.

2575
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,700
Yeah, so you use the same...

2576
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,120
What about that?

2577
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,720
What about this and that?

2578
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:14,520
What's this and that?

2579
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,280
Look for him pointing?

2580
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,680
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

2581
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:38,120
maybe there's a lot of see before we go over there before we go over there i was looking at that or i was looking at getting on this tree and taking the vine here you see this oh uh-huh oh yeah yeah but which way do you guys think is better i think the tree might be better i think so too I think the tree.

2582
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,040
Oh, oh, fuck.

2583
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:45,440
No, I think it's already, guys.

2584
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,180
I think the tree didn't want it.

2585
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,080
I farted.

2586
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,460
That tree there?

2587
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,600
You've been putting down the trail mix, honey.

2588
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,080
Oh, my God.

2589
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:55,680
But I love the seeds.

2590
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,260
They keep giving me good fiber.

2591
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,200
Fiber.

2592
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:00,380
Fiber.

2593
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,180
Fiber, wipe.

2594
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:02,960
Okay.

2595
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,180
Watch out here.

2596
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:07,260
If you're following me, there you go.

2597
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,100
Whoa.

2598
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:12,420
Watch it.

2599
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:13,400
Watch it.

2600
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,360
Watch it.

2601
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:15,620
Watch it.

2602
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,060
I'm watching you, mister.

2603
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:17,460
Pop it a little.

2604
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:18,680
Snip it a little.

2605
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:19,700
Don't sniff it at all.

2606
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:20,960
Don't sniff it.

2607
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:21,840
Don't do that.

2608
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,360
Jessica, you're going to get poisoned if you sniff it.

2609
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,080
I won't lie to you.

2610
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:26,960
Okay.

2611
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,760
I'm here for a helping hand.

2612
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:29,740
Come here.

2613
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:30,800
Come here.

2614
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:31,600
Come here, friends.

2615
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,520
Friends.

2616
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:34,260
Are we here?

2617
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,240
Wait, where's the rope?

2618
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,540
Where's the tree?

2619
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:38,740
Oh, is this it?

2620
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:39,620
This is the tree right here?

2621
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,300
Yeah, I think so.

2622
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,020
Yeah, so we gotta go up a little bit more.

2623
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:45,260
This one?

2624
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:45,900
Yep.

2625
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,320
The tree with the two tufts.

2626
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,460
You know, these kind of look like Lorax trees.

2627
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,140
They do!

2628
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:54,620
Let it die!

2629
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,660
Let it grow!

2630
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:56,420
Let it die!

2631
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,040
Oh, let it die!

2632
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,840
There are two mindsets.

2633
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:01,400
Alright.

2634
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:02,640
Here we go!

2635
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:03,720
Let it grow and let it die.

2636
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:34,800

Oh no!

Oh no!

2639
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,000
Oh no!

2640
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,460
Okay.

2641
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,420
Well, where are you?

2642
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:46,980
Oh this is me body!

2643
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:47,980
Oh my god!

2644
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:49,140
The world?

2645
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,520
What the world?

2646
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,760
Oh, I'm dead.

2647
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,400
Why can you not go up there?

2648
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,400
That's so dumb.

2649
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:57,660
Oh god.

2650
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,680
Oh god.

2651
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:01,720
Oh no.

2652
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:03,440
It's cooked.

01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:41,800
Rest up.

Stunning, stunning.

2691
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:43,060
Stunning.

2692
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:45,340
You've got the best performance I've ever seen.

2693
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,820
Oh, this is a little...

2694
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:49,680
No, no, you're fine.

2695
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:50,700
Oh.

01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:52,280
Oh, how'd you do that?

2697
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:52,780
Wait.

01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:56,600
Yeah.

2700
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:57,480

01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:58,260
Yeah.

01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,980
Take a good little.

02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:00,900
There you go.

2704
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,040

2705
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:02,620

Let it go.

2711
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:40,780
No.

2712
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:42,820
And just like that.

2713
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,140
That was so beautiful.

2714
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,500
I feel, I feel a hundred pounds lighter.

2715
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:47,940
Wow.

2718
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:49,760
Dang.

2719
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,120
Holy moly.

2720
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:53,660
They were packing.

2721
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,220
Yeah.

2722
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,940
Why do you think we crashed?

2723
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,020
What you keeping in there, darling?

2724
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,660
Apples, apparently.

2725
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:06,580
I will bring us to victory.

2726
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:08,060
Yeah, you will.

2727
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,440
Yeah, you will.

2728
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,000
You're doing fantastic.

2729
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:12,940
Wait, how is your stamina going down?

2730
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,280
Oh, because you're running.

2731
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:15,700
Oh, okay.

2732
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,500
Hey, hey, listen, you don't need to rush.

2733
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:19,780
We will wait.

2734
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:21,580
Except when the fog comes.

2735
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:22,800
Oh, yeah.

2736
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,480
You do need to rush away from that gift.

2737
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,180
Now, can I climb this tree?

2738
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:26,760
We will climb forever, though.

2739
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,740
So don't worry.

2740
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:30,640
your heart desires.

2741
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:33,260
I mean, I don't know.

2742
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:35,400
I think it's slippery right now, though, so it's a little tough.

2743
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,540
Yeah, that might not be...

2744
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:36,740
Oh.

2745
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:39,540
That might be a little...

2746
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:39,940
Yeah, yeah.

2747
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,460
There you go.

2748
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:41,880
Girthy, maybe.

2749
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:45,780
All right, let's really take a gander at this.

2750
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,340
Oh, there's a little rope over there.

2751
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,020
Maybe I'll take that.

2752
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:48,940
Yeah!

2753
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:50,680
Yeah.

2754
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:51,880
Well, if I can reach it.

2755
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,760
If you climb up...

2756
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,480
Yeah, you can.

2757
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,240
You can go up there.

2758
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:56,880
Oh, for sure.

2759
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:57,480
Yeah.

2760
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,820
That's easy peasy.

2761
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,120
That's beginner climbers stuff.

2762
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:03,200
For a moth like you.

2763
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:05,660
Yeah.

2764
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,260
Oh yeah.

2765
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,260
Grab it.

2766
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:11,700
Grab it with your thumbs.

2767
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:12,080
Oh!

2768
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:12,420
Oh!

2769
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:12,920
Nice.

2770
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:13,320
Save.

2771
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:13,860
Save.

2772
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:15,020
Okay.

2773
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:20,880
I'm thinking I'll take this and go up this way maybe or I can take...

2774
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,600
Don't go too far to the right because you'll go into the fog.

2775
02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:24,760
Oh.

2776
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:25,580
Yeah.

2777
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,000
Maybe I take this to there.

2778
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that looks good.

2779
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:32,340
You can go to go to there.

2780
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,520
Or maybe this one right here to go to there.

2781
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:38,700
I think this one might be safer because stamina.

2782
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:41,140
It's getting quite foggy, you do what you gotta do now.

2783
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,940
I would also jump so you get more distance.

2784
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:45,100
Grab!

2785
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:46,160
Nice.

2786
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:46,780
Yeah.

2787
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:49,700
Oh yeah, that's gaming.

2788
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:51,300
That's Manny gaming.

2789
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,040

I'm afraid of everything.

2800
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:08,880
Use those grippers.

2801
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:10,000
Use those phalanges.

2802
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:10,680
Use them.

2803
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:12,220
Use them to your high content.

2804
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,280
Use your grippers.

2805
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:13,940
Use your grippers.

2806
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:16,260
You're so close.

2807
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:17,840
This is the easy part.

2808
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2809
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,760
Oh, maybe.

2810
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:21,520
Grip away.

02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,260
Where do you go from here?

2812
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:23,940
Keep gripping that grip.

2813
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:26,140
If you need more grip, you can use your toes.

2814
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:29,180
If you need to grip, if you're done with gripping, you can also grapple.

2815
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:59,880
Grip and grappling is also really yeah yeah Love that one specifically Some people Oh yeah that way that way yeah yeah Oh that's the good stuff Oh yeah Nothing could possibly go wrong Oh oh she pooted Oh no Okay I'm out of it It won't get me it won't get me Yeah I just had some of that That's not good Get to every time.

02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,660
Don't worry about it.

2819
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,280
Grippy is Maximus.

2820
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,500
They tell me I need to grip.

2821
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:09,980

And what do I see?

2849
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:41,260
Not a campfire in sight.

02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:42,820

2851
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,200

You did it.

2899
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,600
I need to do a little dance.

Okay, friends.

Oh, statue.

Oh my god.

2909
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:22,120
Oh my god.

2910
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:22,560
Oh god.

2911
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:23,560
We exploded.

Hey, Monty!

Yay!

Group hug, group hug, group hug, group hug!

02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:32,340
Yeah!

2918
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:37,610
Perfect.

2919
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:39,750
Oh, yeah!

2920
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:42,250
Good job, climbers.

2921
02:09:43,190 --> 02:09:45,210
That was so beautiful, Monty Bigel.

2922
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:46,090
I've never been more.

2923
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:49,550
I've never felt so impressed in my life.

2924
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:49,970
I know.

2925
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:52,050
Thank you.

2926
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:53,450
I like a proud father.

2927
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:54,110
She's just crazy.

2928
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:55,490
Mesa.

2929
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:56,410
She's our hero.

2930
02:09:56,990 --> 02:09:57,310
Whoa.

2931
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:59,430
Now we are back as well.

2932
02:09:59,550 --> 02:10:01,590
A quadro.

2933
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:03,370
What do they call a team of four?

2934
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:04,550
A quadro.

2935
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:07,750
A pedro.

2936
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:08,450
A quadro.

2937
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:11,150
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro.

2938
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,950
Pedro, Pedro.

2939
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:21,810
Guys, it's the Mesa biome and if anyone knows anyone better than Mesa, what?

2940
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:25,890
I'm an expert at the Mesa, that's all I have to say.

2941
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:28,170
This one, it can't be difficult.

2942
02:10:28,490 --> 02:10:28,670
What?

2943
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:30,550
It's just a A bunch of rocks.

2944
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:31,390
What is that?

2945
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:31,910
Oh.

2946
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:33,190
A bomb!

2947
02:10:34,270 --> 02:10:34,290
Oh!

2948
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:40,170
Oh my boy!

2949
02:10:40,410 --> 02:10:41,010
My leg!

2950
02:10:41,410 --> 02:10:42,130
My leg!

2951
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:51,370
Is everybody all right?

2952
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:52,530
Is everybody all right?

2953
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:55,730
I had a great view in all this way.

2954
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,990
That

2955
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:10,810
was like the best timing.

2956
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:11,150
That was like the best timing.

2957
02:11:11,310 --> 02:11:12,090
It was so good.

2958
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:14,630
Oh, there's a tornado!

2959
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:18,210
Oh, what the heck?

2960
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:19,610
What the hellie?

2961
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,590

2962
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:22,910

Where is everybody?

2964
02:11:25,230 --> 02:11:26,250
Where are you?

2965
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:27,630
I died.

2966
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:28,450
What?

2967
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:30,750
I'm kind of in a crevice right now.

2968
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:32,330
Oh no.

2969
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:32,830
I slipped.

2970
02:11:33,190 --> 02:11:34,010
But I'm okay.

2971
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:36,950
You're in a crevice.

2972
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:37,750
I'll find you.

2973
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:38,710
Yeah.

2974
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:40,870
I'll piggyback you the whole way.

2975
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:41,970

02:11:42,530 --> 02:12:13,310

2977
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:15,110
I was so close.

2978
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:17,010
But her bones are my arms.

2979
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:18,970
Wait, the bones are there still?

2980
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:20,070
That's so freaky.

2981
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:21,750
The bones in my arms.

2982
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:24,390
Oh, wow.

2983
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,870
It's so cute.

2984
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:28,830
To where's, do we go now?

2985
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:32,110
Um, let's just go forward, I guess.

2986
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:34,890
Hey, Sean's good to me, man.

2987
02:12:34,990 --> 02:12:35,770
Whatever you say.

2988
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:36,550
Yeah.

2989
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:39,050
I don't think there's much we can do.

2990
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:40,610
Except just walk.

2991
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:41,910
Oh, and climb.

2992
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:44,590
We're going for a hike.

2993
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:44,850
Oh.

2994
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:47,410
That bagel, go.

2995
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:48,510
Yeah, go!

2996
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,070
Go!

2997
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:56,950
You climb with the bagel once and the bagel climbs once, but you teach a bagel to climb and it climbs forever.

2998
02:12:57,490 --> 02:12:59,450
That was so poetic.

2999
02:12:59,670 --> 02:12:59,810
Ouch!

3000
02:13:00,210 --> 02:13:00,450
Oh!

3001
02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:01,950
The ground is fire!

3002
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:04,010
The ground is... Oh my god!

3003
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:05,390
Oh my god!

3004
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:06,730
Oh my god!

3005
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,550
Oh my god!

3006
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:10,950
Oh!

3007
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:16,550
They're flaying me!

3008
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:18,950
Oh, oh, I'm...

3009
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:20,170
Oh, oh, guys.

3010
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,450
Don't, don't, don't, are you up there?

3011
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:23,310
Where are you?

3012
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:24,050
No, we're fine.

3013
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:24,670
Oh, I see you.

3014
02:13:24,670 --> 02:13:25,710
I'm on the ground.

3015
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,670
Yeah, hello, hello.

3016
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:28,890
My vision's blurry.

3017
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:29,990
Oh, God.

3018
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:33,710
No, it's, it's not, it's not, we just gotta find a watering hole.

3019
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:35,130
Oh, my gosh, it was fake!

3020
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:37,530
I actually had a hallucination of a...

3021
02:13:38,030 --> 02:13:38,830
Oh, no!

3022
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:40,330
I'm hallucinating.

3023
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,150
I'm hallucinating water holes.

3024
02:13:42,170 --> 02:13:43,090
and suitcases.

3025
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:44,430
Oh, God.

3026
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:45,510
And tornadoes.

3027
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:46,530
Oh.

3028
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:47,110
Wait.

3029
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:48,450
Wait, I think the tornado was real.

3030
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:52,670
If the tornado is coming close to me, does that mean it's coming close to me?

3031
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:58,350
If the tornado is coming close to me.

3032
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:00,310
Oh, it's coming.

3033
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:00,850
Oh.

3034
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:02,530
Oh, no.

3035
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:04,330
I wanted to suck me up.

3036
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:06,010
Oh, God.

3037
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,050
Oh, my.

3038
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:10,910
Well, I'm experiencing that right now, and I got stuck to a cactus, and I can't move.

3039
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:12,030
And I'm on fire.

3040
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:12,750
What?

3041
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:14,430
Wait, where?

3042
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:17,270
Oh, no.

3043
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:18,130
Oh, it's coming back.

3044
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:18,790
I gotta go.

3045
02:14:18,990 --> 02:14:19,430
Oh, no.

3046
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:21,090
The ground is hot.

3047
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:21,790
The ground.

3048
02:14:22,870 --> 02:14:23,550
Run, Miss Big.

3049
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:23,770
Oh, my God.

3050
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:24,350
I'm gonna get sucked.

3051
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:25,010
I'm gonna get sucked.

3052
02:14:25,210 --> 02:14:25,430
Okay.

3053
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:29,410
It's pretty fun to get sucked, but, you know, I don't recommend it.

3054
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:30,290
No.

3055
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:31,670
No.

3056
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:33,190
I scared.

3057
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:34,190
Please.

3058
02:14:34,630 --> 02:14:34,770
It's going.

3059
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:36,530
Oh, it's the end.

3060
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:37,310
It's the end.

3061
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:38,190
Oh, it's so hot.

3062
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:39,490
I'm sucked.

3063
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:40,810
Oh, it's so hot.

3064
02:14:41,090 --> 02:14:41,150
Oh, it's so hot.

3065
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:41,950
I just double shook.

3066
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:45,190
This is kind of like the rapture.

3067
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:47,030
What in God's name are these sounds that I'm hearing?

3068
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:49,830
I don't even know what direction is up anymore.

3069
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:50,710
I can't give up.

3070
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:53,170
There's a watering hole waiting for me.

3071
02:14:54,070 --> 02:14:55,650
I think I've got raptured.

3072
02:14:56,270 --> 02:14:57,930
I'm sure the cactus has water.

3073
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:59,210
Yeah, the cactus has water!

3074
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:01,290
Yeah, there you go!

3075
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:03,730
Wait, my life bar is getting like crazy long.

3076
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:04,650
How is this possible?

3077
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:09,030
I know you have yellow, orange, red, black, green.

3078
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,890
I've got the rainbow.

3079
02:15:10,930 --> 02:15:11,370
Yeah.

3080
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:42,590

be careful, be careful though.

3082
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:46,330
You seem to have gotten pricked there just a bit.

3083
02:15:47,050 --> 02:15:47,290
You okay?

3084
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:48,650
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3085
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:51,470
I did this at Summer Camp.

3086
02:15:51,970 --> 02:15:55,610
That suitcase is probably not real, but you could check it out.

3087
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:56,690
That one?

3088
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:57,730
Yeah.

3089
02:15:57,910 --> 02:15:59,110
I'm gonna burn the death.

3090
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:00,310
It ain't worth it.

3091
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:01,990
I'm gonna burn the death.

3092
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:02,830
I don't know.

3093
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:04,010
But what if it's real?

3094
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:05,710
Wait, there's so many of them.

3095
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:08,150
You should just try opening it.

3096
02:16:08,230 --> 02:16:09,190
Yeah, just go.

3097
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:10,390
Just go sniff it.

3098
02:16:10,810 --> 02:16:11,330
I can smell.

3099
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:38,230

I have no idea.

3101
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:40,690
Yes.

3102
02:16:40,910 --> 02:16:41,350
Misty.

3103
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:44,350
Probably not one of us, probably someone else who's been here before.

3104
02:16:44,530 --> 02:16:44,750
Yeah.

3105
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:46,470
Oh, wait, there's another one.

3106
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:48,490
There's a beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

3107
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:49,430
Turn around, turn around.

3108
02:16:50,030 --> 02:16:50,570
Right there.

3109
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,290
In the hole.

3110
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:52,030
In the hole.

3111
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:53,210
Oh, in the hole.

3112
02:16:55,630 --> 02:16:58,610
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.

3113
02:16:58,890 --> 02:16:59,510
Oh my god.

3114
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:01,890
Oh my god.

3115
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:02,790
Oh my god.

3116
02:17:03,330 --> 02:17:03,670
Oh my god.

3117
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:05,810
I did not know that happened.

3118
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:06,750
Me neither.

3119
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:07,370
Oh.

3120
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:09,670
We didn't lead you astray.

3121
02:17:09,950 --> 02:17:10,770
It was a fluke.

3122
02:17:10,850 --> 02:17:12,050
It was a fluke.

3123
02:17:12,990 --> 02:17:14,470
That was horrifying.

3124
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:15,750
That was pretty freaky.

3125
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:17,110
I did not like that.

3126
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:19,970
The worm wanted to eat my toes.

3127
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:23,350
They wanted your little toesies.

3128
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:25,730
Please not my toes, princess.

3129
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,870
They're pretty cute.

3130
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:27,990
I don't blame them.

3131
02:17:29,810 --> 02:17:30,590
Oh, thanks.

3132
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:32,910
Yeah, I got cute toes, man.

3133
02:17:33,490 --> 02:17:34,730
I got a pedicure, you know.

3134
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:37,590
Is this like the deadliest biome that's in the world?

3135
02:17:37,610 --> 02:17:38,670
there is in this game.

3136
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:40,790
This seems bad, yeah.

3137
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:45,590
Fucking tornadoes, a worm in the floor.

3138
02:17:46,930 --> 02:17:48,530
I'm not gonna lie, I misjudged it.

3139
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:52,590
After the hellscape that was the last bomb, I was like, nothing can be worse.

3140
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:53,570
This is worse.

3141
02:17:53,630 --> 02:17:54,410
This is, yeah.

3142
02:17:54,930 --> 02:17:57,690
Yeah, this is even worse, I think, than the final level.

3143
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:58,970
What?

3144
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:01,150
And I have to do this without dying?

3145
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:02,390
Yep.

3146
02:18:05,490 --> 02:18:07,930
That was the most innocent little Yep.

3147
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:11,230
Yep.

3148
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:14,750
I hear, I think I hear the tornado.

3149
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:16,990
Don't say such a thing.

3150
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:20,830
There's no, there's, there's no such thing.

3151
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:22,610
There's a suitcase below you.

3152
02:18:24,050 --> 02:18:24,730
It's real.

3153
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,550
Wait, can you just keep going down?

3154
02:18:26,730 --> 02:18:27,150
What have you going down?

3155
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:28,770
Oh, you have a bandage.

3156
02:18:28,890 --> 02:18:29,410
I would use that.

3157
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:30,050
That's okay.

3158
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:31,770
Yeah, I'm just gonna put that on real quick.

3159
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:32,430
Don't mind me.

3160
02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:34,570
Oh, yes.

3161
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:36,110
Oh, listen.

3162
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:37,330
I'm a professional...

3163
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:38,670
Everything I've ever done.

3164
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:39,810
Professional.

3165
02:18:40,850 --> 02:18:41,710
What if there's like a...

3166
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:43,610
What if there's an underground passageway?

3167
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:46,010
Sunscreen!

3168
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:49,730
Why you... Why you...

3169
02:18:49,730 --> 02:18:50,110
What?

3170
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:51,370
Say it to my face.

3171
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:54,230
You're like convulsing on the suitcase.

3172
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:57,110
It's because I need sunburn.

3173
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:58,430
It's part of the process, guys.

3174
02:18:58,550 --> 02:18:59,110
Come on.

3175
02:18:59,170 --> 02:18:59,950
It's part of the process.

3176
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:02,870
I hear something coming.

3177
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:03,570
I'm kind of scared.

3178
02:19:03,910 --> 02:19:04,170
But it's night time.

3179
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:05,130
You don't need it now.

3180
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:07,070
Ooh.

3181
02:19:07,970 --> 02:19:10,290
Where the answer is going horribly wrong if I use this?

3182
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:11,030
Just use it.

3183
02:19:11,310 --> 02:19:11,470
Frick it.

3184
02:19:11,630 --> 02:19:12,510
It won't, yeah.

3185
02:19:13,050 --> 02:19:13,290
Use it.

3186
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:15,490
Use it, point it upwards, and just, yeah.

3187
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,690
Yeah, let it rip.

3188
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:18,150
Let it rip.

3189
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:22,670
I would position it so you make sure it's moving upwards.

3190
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:24,330
Be careful.

3191
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:28,690
Yeah, um...

3192
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:30,990
Alright, um...

3193
02:19:30,990 --> 02:19:31,790
Yeah, hold on.

3194
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:33,250
I think I need a better vantage point.

3195
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:37,170
I think I'm gonna launch myself into a bunch of rocks and just die on site.

3196
02:19:37,610 --> 02:20:09,630
you grab the rocks it's genius wait you're right okay hold on right right over here perhaps perhaps i think maybe does this seem it is night time now by the way i feel like uh-huh okay i think you could just keep going you think why not i guess so i mean it is night time yeah i feel like maybe maybe we save the can honestly if you just keep going And don't think about it too much.

3197
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:11,450
You'll get there.

3198
02:20:11,790 --> 02:20:12,490
Don't overthink.

3199
02:20:12,850 --> 02:20:13,110
Yeah.

3200
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:16,530
To heck with the tornadoes.

3201
02:20:17,150 --> 02:20:23,810
The more you overthink, the more your brain will get big and you'll get weighted down.

3202
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:24,650
You don't want to do that.

3203
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:25,950
Look, you're already almost there.

3204
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,030
I can see the top.

3205
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:27,930
Yeah.

3206
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:28,950
Bye-bye.

3207
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:32,730
It's not too far up.

3208
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:33,690
Yeah, yeah.

3209
02:20:33,890 --> 02:20:35,990
Wow, that is very far up.

3210
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:36,670
No.

3211
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:37,590
No, it's not.

3212
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:39,770
Maybe a little to your right.

3213
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:41,070
It's fine, don't worry about it.

3214
02:20:41,070 --> 02:20:44,490
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3215
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:46,090
Just keep flopping.

3216
02:20:46,350 --> 02:20:46,710
Yeah, keep rubbing your body.

3217
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:47,370
Oh, okay.

3218
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:49,990
Um, hey, listen, hey.

3219
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:52,030
Hey, listen, maybe, maybe.

3220
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:54,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3221
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:56,850
Now you're thinking.

3222
02:20:57,210 --> 02:20:58,670
I'm thinking real big brain.

3223
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:59,130
Yeah.

3224
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:01,070

02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:01,970
Yep.

02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:06,950
Yeah, so you want to place it down?

Ah, princess, I might have made a short miscalculation.

3230
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:52,390
That worked exactly how I wanted it.

3231
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:58,330
I imagine like, you know, in the cartoons, you have like a face full of ash.

3232
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:59,330
It's just like...

3233
02:22:00,130 --> 02:22:01,970

02:22:02,490 --> 02:22:03,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:04,230
Okay.

02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:51,550
She's slippery.

Nice and slippery.

3247
02:22:54,170 --> 02:22:54,570
I'm...

02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:56,690
Oh, it makes an oopy goopy noise when I climb now.

3249
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:57,730
That's...

3250
02:22:57,910 --> 02:22:58,290
Oh, ew!

3251
02:22:58,650 --> 02:22:59,910

02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:02,650
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

3253
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,430

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3256
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:06,170
You need a little snack.

3257
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:07,650
I think it's time for sunscreen.

3258
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:08,590
Left, left, left, left, left.

3259
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:09,450
Yeah, left, left, left.

3260
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:10,310
Yeah.

3261
02:23:10,330 --> 02:23:15,190
Oh, so close, so close.

3262
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:18,870
Maybe go over there, that little ledge on the left right there, you see?

3263
02:23:19,050 --> 02:23:20,790
Like, there's, like, that little...

3264
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:21,050
Yeah.

3265
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,910
Yeah, there you go.

3266
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:24,550
There you go, yeah.

3267
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:26,090
Oh, no, it's a daisy.

3268
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:27,130
Oh, no, I made it.

3269
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:27,890
You made it, you made it.

3270
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:29,850
Everything's fine, no, don't worry.

3271
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:30,470
Test the sunscreen.

3272
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:30,670
Test the sunscreen.

3273
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:31,950
There you go, nice.

3274
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:33,530
Is that an apple on there?

3275
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:34,550
It's a cactus fruit.

3276
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:38,150
Be careful.

3277
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:39,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3278
02:23:40,330 --> 02:23:41,250
Nice, nice.

3279
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:42,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3280
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:46,310
Don't be alarmed by the tornado getting closer and closer to you.

3281
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:48,590
It's not even that close.

3282
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:50,250
No, no, please.

3283
02:23:50,930 --> 02:23:52,310
I got tornadoed once already.

3284
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:53,230
I don't need it again.

3285
02:23:54,770 --> 02:23:56,670
They sent me launching into a rock.

3286
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:58,290
I got lucky I didn't get marked.

3287
02:23:59,270 --> 02:24:00,210
Oh, marked.

3288
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:01,450
Okay.

3289
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:02,450
Everything's fine.

3290
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,150
Don't worry about it.

3291
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:03,390
Yep.

3292
02:24:04,090 --> 02:24:05,350
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3293
02:24:05,630 --> 02:24:06,110
Okay.

3294
02:24:07,890 --> 02:24:09,050
Do not me mark me.

3295
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:11,550
Ooh, it's warm.

3296
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:12,950
Oh, it's warm, Ow.

3297
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:14,770
No, no, no, it's fine.

3298
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:15,310
Don't worry about it.

3299
02:24:15,310 --> 02:24:16,030
Oh, okay!

3300
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,070
Shift!

3301
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:19,930
Oh, oh!

3302
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:21,850
You're fine.

3303
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:24,350
Okay, okay, I have an idea.

3304
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:25,170
Things are green, yes.

3305
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:28,190
Go up and there's a little ledge to the left.

3306
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:30,050
A little tiny little ledge to the left.

3307
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:31,510
Oh I'm seeing it.

3308
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,890
Yeah, right there.

3309
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:36,210
Get your stamina back, get your stamina, and then go all the way to the right ledge.

3310
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:36,890
To the right?

3311
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:39,110
Oh, hey, listen, this is fine.

3312
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:40,310
Oh, yeah, that's...

3313
02:24:40,330 --> 02:24:41,350
That's fine.

3314
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:43,270
Oh, wow, it actually worked.

3315
02:24:43,630 --> 02:24:44,450
There you go.

3316
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:45,590
She's gaming.

3317
02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:48,870
Okay, Mimi, I don't want you to look up too far.

3318
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:50,790
Just don't look up too far.

3319
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:51,630
Just keep going.

3320
02:24:51,890 --> 02:24:56,010
Just keep trucking along at your own little Mimi pace.

3321
02:24:56,330 --> 02:24:57,550
Like, we're very proud of you.

3322
02:24:58,050 --> 02:24:58,710
Today, not tomorrow.

3323
02:24:58,990 --> 02:25:00,430
Today, not tomorrow.

3324
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:02,330
That's tomorrow Mimi's problem.

3325
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:04,970
Today, Mimi is doing what she's got to do.

3326
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:07,010
And he's doing her dardest.

3327
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:08,710
I'm going to do something I might regret.

3328
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:12,590
Oh, you made it.

3329
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:13,290
Yeah, nice catch.

3330
02:25:13,490 --> 02:25:13,830
Nice catch.

3331
02:25:13,870 --> 02:25:14,250
It's fine.

3332
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:14,870
It's fine.

3333
02:25:15,050 --> 02:25:15,190
Don't worry.

3334
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:15,810
Very great catch.

3335
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:17,570
Yes, yes.

3336
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:18,430
Oh, beautiful.

3337
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:19,410
Steady.

3338
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:21,210
That's my purple.

3339
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:22,230
So purple.

3340
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:23,370
Yes.

3341
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:24,890
Oh, thank you so much.

3342
02:25:24,990 --> 02:25:26,450
So purple and bald.

3343
02:25:26,510 --> 02:25:26,730
Purple's a great color.

3344
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:29,030
If you guys want me to kill myself so you can restart, just let me know.

3345
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:31,470
Purple and bald.

3346
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:32,730
She's got it all.

3347
02:25:33,210 --> 02:25:34,790
Well, uh, involved?

3348
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:35,730
Yeah.

3349
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:37,090
You got a little hat.

3350
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:38,050
Look at your dome.

3351
02:25:38,470 --> 02:25:39,150
Oh, man.

3352
02:25:39,870 --> 02:25:40,310
Oh, man.

3353
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:41,030
Oh no.

3354
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:42,230
New song remix?

3355
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:45,730
Hmm.

3356
02:25:46,850 --> 02:25:47,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:49,690
Donate me.

3358
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:53,970
Oh, there's a lot of bombs.

3359
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:54,710
Look at her dome.

3360
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:56,630
Yes, she's got it all.

3361
02:25:57,070 --> 02:25:58,530
She's in the mesa.

3362
02:25:58,910 --> 02:26:01,810
She's got the peso.

3363
02:26:02,770 --> 02:26:02,870

02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:08,910
Oh, we're cooked.

3367
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:09,950
Oh, we're cooking.

3368
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:12,590
Please don't slip up, we...

3369
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:14,210
We got the sun clean.

3370
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:15,510
Wonder skin.

3371
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:16,810

3398
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:51,460
Oh, maybe what do I have?

3399
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:53,900
You have a bandages and a sports string.

3400
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,620
Sports string.

3401
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,540
Oh my god.

3402
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:57,500
I forgot I took this off of Camilla earlier.

3403
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:58,080
Hold on.

3404
02:27:58,100 --> 02:27:59,700
Oh, my dead body.

3405
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:03,600
My little dead body.

3406
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:06,180
Give to me, use it.

3407
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:06,720
Yeah.

3408
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:07,480
Nice.

3409
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:09,140
And the bandages will help too.

3410
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:09,560
Yeah.

3411
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:11,440
See, it all ties together.

3412
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:12,560
Like it all makes sense.

3413
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:16,260
I died so that she could have my backpack and we would be here.

3414
02:28:16,380 --> 02:28:17,360
And then we're all here.

3415
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:19,680
Everything happens for a reason, you know?

3416
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:21,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3417
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:21,560
Well, you're here.

3418
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:23,020
This was funny that way.

3419
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:25,040
It's not worth it.

3420
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:25,860
It's fine.

3421
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:26,800
Oh, I can make it.

3422
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:27,800
Oh, I'm so...

3423
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:28,580
Oh, Jesus.

3424
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,020
Oh, that was close.

3425
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:31,560
Right, fine.

3426
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,460
Anyways, I'll go this way.

3427
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:33,160
Don't worry about it.

3428
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:37,540
You were just red eagle just convulsing on that rock.

3429
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:39,620
That was crazy.

3430
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:41,400
That was crazy.

3431
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,420
Don't worry about it.

3432
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:44,880
Don't worry about it, princesses.

3433
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:45,440
Don't worry about it.

3434
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:48,120
There was a suitcase over there if you wanted to try for it.

3435
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:49,340
It was before.

3436
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:51,560

The way you said that's so true.

3449
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:06,420
What do I...

3450
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:08,200

Boom.

3453
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:10,380
Right, anyways.

3454
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:11,860
The flip explode.

3455
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:13,480
I'll go this way now.

3456
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:15,580
I can't see she...

3457
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:16,860
I'm blind as bad.

3458
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:17,180
Okay.

3459
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:17,880
Oh, no, you're good.

3460
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:18,440
You're good, yeah.

3461
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:21,380

3462
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:22,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3463
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:24,400
Do I go this way, you think?

3464
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:28,120
I'm surprised the fog hasn't claimed me yet.

3465
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:29,200
I won't lie to you.

3466
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:30,000
Yeah, me too.

3467
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,980
I feel good in front of it all.

3468
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:35,760
That's not very encouraging, but you meant it.

3469
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:36,260
Oh, sorry.

3470
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:37,700
No, it's okay.

Thank you.

3472
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:42,500
Don't worry about it.

3473
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:44,440
This has to be the right way.

3474
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:45,540
I mean...

3475
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:48,160
You're getting a little foggy over this side.

3476
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:51,560
I think you're going a little too far to the fog.

Give her a beat, give her a beat.

3481
02:32:03,490 --> 02:32:04,750
Give me a beat while I die.

3482
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:07,510
I got four lines.

3483

Hey.

3488
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,750
She's in a maze.

3489
02:32:13,230 --> 02:32:14,650
Sunscreen on her face.

3490
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:16,670
She's scared and in a ditch.

3491
02:32:17,250 --> 02:32:18,650
But no, she ain't a bitch.

3492
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3493
02:32:20,170 --> 02:32:21,030
Yeah, yeah.

3494
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:22,670
Yeah, yeah.

Good shit, everybody.

02:32:25,730 --> 02:32:26,670
What are the hearts, man?

3498
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:29,630
But all things considered, that could have been so much worse.

3499
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:31,790
Honestly, you really, you put up a good fight.

3500
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:33,370

I mean, sorry I didn't finish for five.

3512
02:32:48,610 --> 02:32:53,370
For all of our struggles, honestly, I feel we've done very well today.

3513
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:54,730
It's so true.

Okay.

It's like a cavern in there.

02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:41,110
It just felt like I was kept going.

3538
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:41,610
Wait, wait, wait.

3539
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:41,890

02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:49,130
It really is big.

3545
02:33:49,350 --> 02:33:49,730
Yeah.

3546
02:33:50,370 --> 02:34:21,510

Perfetus.

3548
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:25,250
Perfetus.

3549
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:26,890

3550
02:34:27,410 --> 02:34:28,170
Yeah, oh yeah.

3551
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:30,190
No, this was delightful.

3552
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:31,010
Yeah!

3553
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:33,270
It was, it was.

3554
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:35,050
I had a lot of fun.

3555
02:34:35,190 --> 02:34:35,450
Yeah!

3556
02:34:35,790 --> 02:34:36,210
Yeah, me too.

3557
02:34:36,610 --> 02:34:38,470
Let's play games together again sometime.

3558
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:39,930
Yeah.

3559
02:34:40,290 --> 02:34:40,490
Sure.

3560
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:41,710
Anytime.

3561
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:43,630
We touch them amazingly quick.

3562
02:34:43,810 --> 02:34:44,390
We just...

3563
02:34:44,390 --> 02:34:44,970
Oh, yes.

3564
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:47,250
I hope to see you triple BBL next time.

3565
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:49,870
Oh, don't you know it.

3566
02:34:50,490 --> 02:34:51,930
Glintop will be hit.

3567
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:59,850
Mint's gonna come back and she's just gonna be fully like, like, like puffed up like a fucking marshmallow boy, like a pills boy.

3568
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:01,450
Yeah.

3569
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:03,770
Everything is gonna be injected.

3570
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:07,550
I'll never, I'll never die from fall damage again.

3571
02:35:08,350 --> 02:35:08,610
Yeah.

3572
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:09,510
We'll just bounce.

3573
02:35:09,710 --> 02:35:10,770
We'll constantly bounce.

3574
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:15,650
Yeah, you can just, I'll just lay down and you guys can jump on my body.

3575
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:20,250
Oh, yes, he'll be our fall if we need it.

3576
02:35:20,350 --> 02:35:20,830
It won't hurt.

3577
02:35:20,990 --> 02:35:23,110
We won't break any more bones or anything.

3578
02:35:23,310 --> 02:35:25,170
Oh, my god.

3579
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:26,890
That's horrible.

3580
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:28,850
I'm just visiting that.

3581
02:35:28,990 --> 02:35:29,770
It's so horrible.

3582
02:35:30,210 --> 02:35:31,650
I died a second time for that.

3583
02:35:33,250 --> 02:35:35,890
I better get out of here before I actually die.

3584
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:37,610
Please don't die.

3585
02:35:37,770 --> 02:35:38,210
Don't die.

3586
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:38,890
Oh, I won't.

3587
02:35:39,010 --> 02:35:39,490
I won't.

3588
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:39,890
I won't.

3589
02:35:39,890 --> 02:35:40,770
I love you, sweet fairy.

3590
02:35:41,050 --> 02:35:42,170
Instead, I explode.

3591
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:43,210
Oh, no.

3592
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:46,550
Oh, no.

3593
02:35:47,610 --> 02:35:48,330
Oh, no.

3594
02:35:49,010 --> 02:35:50,250
Oh, she's actually gone.

3595
02:35:50,350 --> 02:35:53,250
Oh, no, my dear.

3596
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:54,310
Hold on.

3597
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:55,110
There she goes.

3598
02:35:55,210 --> 02:35:55,910
There she goes.

3599
02:35:56,870 --> 02:35:57,970
Okay, guys.

3600
02:35:58,390 --> 02:35:58,710
Okay.

3601
02:35:59,530 --> 02:36:01,630
That was our next BBL session.

3602
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:03,270
Till our next BBL session.

3603
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:04,910
I'll never forget you.

3604
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:06,350
I'll never forget you.

3605
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:13,710
Oh, my God.

3606
02:36:14,370 --> 02:36:14,410
Oh, love you.

3607
02:36:14,410 --> 02:36:15,490
Kiss you, kiss you.

3608
02:36:18,090 --> 02:36:18,810
Oh.

3609
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:19,690
Oh.

3610
02:36:20,330 --> 02:36:21,050
Oh.

3611
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:23,670
Yay.

3612
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:55,240
What's...

3613
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:57,040
Oh, she's so fast!

3614
02:36:59,140 --> 02:36:59,540
What?

3615
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:06,240
Oh, she's so fast!

3616
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:07,780
Oh, she's so fast!

3617
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:08,480
Oh my god!

3618
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:11,150
I need a new... I need a new...

3619
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:13,350
uh, mouse, apparently.

3620
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:17,940
Ah!

3621
02:37:23,850 --> 02:37:24,550
Good.

3622
02:37:24,650 --> 02:37:24,790
Oh.

3623
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:27,730
What happened?

3624
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:42,550
How did she do that?

3625
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:44,890
How was she so talented?

3626
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:48,270
Okay, I leave.

3627
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:51,110
Ta-da!

3628
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:57,960
I hope you guys had fun.

3629
02:37:58,800 --> 02:37:59,980
With Peek.

3630
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:01,740
Wow.

3631
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:03,760
Guys, I think we need Limeu.

3632
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:06,340
Guys.

3633
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,380
Guys, we're nothing without Limeu.

3634
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:13,580
It was so fun, though.

3635
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:17,060
Yeah, I'm so much fun with everybody.

3636
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:21,280
Oh, Limeu hard carry.

3637
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:22,600
Limeu's our pro.

3638
02:38:22,740 --> 02:38:23,500
But the Mesa!

3639
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,020
The Mesa was too difficult.

3640
02:38:26,500 --> 02:38:30,160
Why does it have cactus at heat?

3641
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:36,700
It has tornado, it has scorpion, it has...

3642
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:39,220
Everything!

3643
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:41,400
There was dynamite, yeah!

3644
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:43,560
It had so many!

3645
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:47,740
So many dangers!

3646
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:49,400
Fake Need, thank you so much!

3647
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:50,600
Thank you, thank you!

3648
02:38:51,820 --> 02:38:54,520
Yeah, and the big bug in the pit!

3649
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:57,180
It's crazy!

3650
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,300
I feel like that's a final level.

3651
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:02,240
with the amount of hazards or...

3652
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:04,700
I guess you get kind of like...

3653
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:07,040
Uh...

3654
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:07,660
What's the word?

3655
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:10,940
A break when it turns night.

3656
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:12,860
But...

3657
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:14,040
Like, what the heck?

3658
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,620
What the heck?

3659
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:19,060
Good morning, meepto.

3660
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:21,780
Good morning, glam jamming!

3661
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,340
We're jamming, jamming, jamming.

3662
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:25,220
Welcome back, thank you.

3663
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:27,100
And mirages!

3664
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:28,900
I got bamboozled.

3665
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:32,860
I think...

3666
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:41,940
I've always thought that if I were in the desert and dehydrated with nothing around, I thought I would be stronger when I would never hallucinate.

3667
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:44,820
Clearly not.

3668
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,500
Clearly, I'm weak.

3669
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:49,800
And I fell for it.

3670
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:51,600
I did.

3671
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:53,560
That one was crazy.

3672
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:55,000
That was a crazy...

3673
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:57,180
map.

3674
02:39:57,660 --> 02:40:00,520
But I'm glad that we got to see the new one, at least.

3675
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:01,940
So, yeah.

3676
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:04,980
You would see Osalaw.

3677
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:08,940
Maybe, though.

3678
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,160
Maybe, though.

3679
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:13,400
I thought the volcano was the most dangerous biome.

3680
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:18,460
Honestly, compared to this, it feels like the volcano didn't have enough.

3681
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:24,240
Like, all it is, I mean, of course, it's a difficult climb, but, like, it feels like they...

3682
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,660
It doesn't have enough hazards.

3683
02:40:26,060 --> 02:40:27,440
Maybe they added some stuff, though.

3684
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:29,420
Okay.

3685
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:32,780
There's a golden idol if you bring...

3686
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:35,220
If bing bong is in there.

3687
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:36,560
In the volcano?

3688
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:42,300
You hear the meow echoing off the cannonballs.

3689
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:47,160
Man.

3690
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:52,950
I've played a lot and the mesa is very long, but the volcano is definitely harder.

3691
02:40:53,670 --> 02:40:55,250
It was...

3692
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:57,990
It's the shore, the jungle.

3693
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:07,150
either the mesa or the cold and then the final one, right?

3694
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:08,050
It's just the four?

3695
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:09,990
I can't remember what the other one was.

3696
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:12,330
There we go, thank you!

3697
02:41:12,810 --> 02:41:16,490
Not sure if you're keeping up with Meow Tower, Music Box Dailies, but I think you would like this one.

3698
02:41:16,850 --> 02:41:20,810
I haven't been keeping up with the Dailies, but I'll check it out.

3699
02:41:21,070 --> 02:41:22,150
I'll check it, thank you.

3700
02:41:25,710 --> 02:41:27,010
Volcano has two stages.

3701
02:41:27,290 --> 02:41:27,970
That's right!

3702
02:41:27,990 --> 02:41:28,590
That's right.

3703
02:41:28,670 --> 02:41:30,530
There's the outside and then the inside.

3704
02:41:31,330 --> 02:41:33,210
Yeah, the volcano and then the kiln.

3705
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:34,690
Oh my god.

3706
02:41:38,890 --> 02:41:40,550
Yeah, I forgot about that.

3707
02:41:40,850 --> 02:41:41,590
I forgot about that.

3708
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:45,550
Crazy!

3709
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:48,010
But I really appreciate you guys watching.

3710
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:49,990
I didn't...

3711
02:41:50,690 --> 02:41:51,210

02:41:51,210 --> 02:41:53,390

02:41:53,390 --> 02:41:56,310

3714
02:41:56,450 --> 02:41:58,310

Alright, updated the description.

3718
02:43:06,730 --> 02:43:13,610
I haven't put out my schedule yet for this week, but I will put it out after the stream.

3719
02:43:18,610 --> 02:43:19,570
And, yeah.

3720
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:24,920
This means you're pretty too since you're Moni.

3721
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:26,340
No!

3722
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:30,220
I'm sending the Supa after caching in my first checkbox.

3723
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:31,520
of my new job!

3724
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,000
Goffal!

3725
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:34,920
Thank you for all of my time on streaming.

3726
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:36,940
If you miss it, it's my last one.

3727
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:39,000
Poor, it says Goffal!

3728
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:41,280
No, don't send me that.

3729
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:43,600
You should get something delicious for yourself instead.

3730
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:45,860
No!

3731
02:43:49,610 --> 02:43:49,950
No!

3732
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:55,550
Congrats, though.

3733
02:43:58,670 --> 02:43:59,930
And I have merch.

3734
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:03,410
Until the end of this month.

3735
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:15,190
October 2025 in case you're watching it a different a different time I have merch ending this month for my birthday

3736
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:33,950

3737

Use your recommendation and got the partner Q-Pot!

3738
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:37,170

3739
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,030
Stuff for her birthday and she seemed to like it all.

3740
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:39,850
Setsukami-ki!

3741
02:44:40,270 --> 02:44:40,410
Oh!

3742
02:44:41,170 --> 02:44:41,710
Nice!

3743
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:43,210
Nice!

3744
02:44:45,170 --> 02:44:48,350
I love Gelato Peek and Q-Pot.

3745
02:44:49,310 --> 02:44:49,770
Thanks, sir.

3746
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:51,710
You followed my...

3747
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:53,570
You thought my advice was good?

3748
02:44:55,550 --> 02:44:57,290
You actually listen to me?

3749
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:04,420
You listen to me?

3750
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:05,720
You...

3751
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:06,920
You...

3752
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:07,740
You...

3753
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:14,060
Followed my advice and then it worked up.

3754
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:15,840
You...

3755
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:16,720
You were...

3756
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:18,340
Am I an influencer?

3757
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:23,180
Ah, thank you.

3758
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:26,100
I don't know why I'm thanking you.

3759
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:27,980
But...

3760
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:30,380
Well, I guess thank you for you, sir, taking my advice.

3761
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:31,640
For trusting me.

3762
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:33,480
Thank you for trusting me.

3763
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:42,030
For non-Twitter folks, EU merch shipping is better now.

3764
02:45:43,430 --> 02:45:43,670
Yeah.

3765
02:45:44,630 --> 02:45:45,210
It is.

3766
02:45:46,730 --> 02:45:52,610
Steiner apparently was like, I'm gonna have it all shipped to my house, and I'll ship it from my house.

3767
02:45:56,590 --> 02:45:58,130
I think we made some good music.

3768
02:45:58,370 --> 02:46:00,290
I think we made some good memories.

3769
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:02,150
I think we're a good team.

3770
02:46:02,290 --> 02:46:03,430
Even if we don't...

3771
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:05,410
We're not a good team in that we win.

3772
02:46:05,530 --> 02:46:07,490
But we win in friendship.

3773
02:46:08,790 --> 02:46:09,710
Okay!

3774
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:11,710
I'm gonna go now.

3775
02:46:12,150 --> 02:46:16,650
Thank you guys so, so much for hanging out with me again.

3776
02:46:18,150 --> 02:46:19,070
Um...

3777
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:21,730
And I will see you when I see you next.

3778
02:46:23,330 --> 02:46:23,790
And...

3779
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:24,550
Yeah!

3780
02:46:25,870 --> 02:46:26,390
Watabito!

3781
02:46:26,930 --> 02:46:27,450
Watabito!

3782
02:46:27,970 --> 02:46:28,130
Watabito!

3783
02:46:31,750 --> 02:46:33,670
Oh, to maintain.

3784
02:46:38,270 --> 02:46:39,290
Out your way, though.

3785
02:46:39,490 --> 02:46:41,230
Okay, I'm just going to take my leave now.

3786
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:49,470
I'm just, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I can't see you out, but I'll, you know, I'm just, I'll just, I'll just go this way.

3787
02:46:49,790 --> 02:47:03,430
Okay, and you're going that way, and I'm going this way, and you're going that way, and I'm going this way, so it won't be awkward, you know, when I, when I go this way, and you go that, I go this way, you go that way, we're not going to run into each other or anything,

3788
02:47:03,670 --> 02:47:04,570
you know, so.

3789
02:47:10,530 --> 02:47:12,570
Digital Canary, welcome back!

3790
02:47:14,110 --> 02:47:15,130
Yeah, I'll see you guys.

3791
02:47:15,390 --> 02:47:16,350
I go this way.

3792
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:17,550
You go that way.

3793
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:19,190
Okay?

3794
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:22,010
Wait, I'm going that way too.

3795
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:22,470
No, no!

3796
02:47:22,810 --> 02:47:25,390
The only my maid cafe is this way.

3797
02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:27,090
There's no one else.

3798
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:30,830
Go eyes with me, though.

3799
02:47:31,050 --> 02:47:31,450
No!

3800
02:47:31,690 --> 02:47:32,610
Avoid the tornado.

3801
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:37,530
Okay, I'm going this way.

3802
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:39,590
You guys are going that way.

3803
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:43,090
No, no, you're not following me.

3804
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:43,870
No, no.

3805
02:47:44,490 --> 02:47:45,310
I'm going this way.

3806
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:50,190
Okay.

3807
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:51,190
All right.

3808
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:55,410
I followed your advice about Hawk to a Coin and I'm bankruptcy.

3809
02:47:57,010 --> 02:47:57,890
Please advise.

3810
02:47:58,130 --> 02:47:59,130
Actually, that was very...

3811
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,050
Ooh.

3812
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:02,570
Advised.

3813
02:48:04,250 --> 02:48:05,270
Oh, wow.

3814
02:48:05,390 --> 02:48:06,230
Would you look at the time?

3815
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:07,390
It's time for me to go this way.

3816
02:48:07,710 --> 02:48:07,990
Okay.

3817
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:08,830
Bye.

3818
02:48:09,110 --> 02:48:09,910
Bye!
