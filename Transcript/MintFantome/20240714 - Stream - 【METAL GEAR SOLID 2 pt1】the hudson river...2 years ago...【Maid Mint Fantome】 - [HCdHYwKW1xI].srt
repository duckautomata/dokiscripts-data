1
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,260
Kept you waiting, huh?

2
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:59,100
Welcome to Metal Gear Solid 2's Substance Sound!

3
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,740
Yippee!

4
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Yippee!

5
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Hello!

6
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,100
Welcome back, Master!

7
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,700
Lady!

8
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,280
If it isn't Saucy Mint!

9
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,440
Oh my god, that actually works the most here.

10
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,840
Hold on, I'm going to turn it up because I love this game a little too much.

11
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,540
That girl always keeps you waiting.

12
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh my gosh, let's watch the intro real quick!

13
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,060
PS2?

14
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes!

15
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
On my PS2, actually.

16
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,180
Yes, yes, yes.

17
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh my gosh, a Hideo Kojima game.

18
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,960
The saga continues.

19
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,220
This intro is so awesome.

20
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh my gosh.

21
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,800
It's so cool.

22
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,800
Oh my gosh, Declaration of Independence.

23
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,280
Wait, is that the Constitution or is that the Decl...

24
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,680
Um...

25
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,940
David Hayden!

26
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,530
Hold on, I'm going to turn it up a little more.

27
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,310
Da-da-da!

28
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,350
Da-da-da-da-da!

29
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,750
Da-da-da!

30
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,570
Da-da-da-da-da!

31
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,170
Oh yeah, Olga!

32
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,590
Oh my gosh, she's so sexy!

33
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,190
Da-da-da-da!

34
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,890
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to play as Snake the whole game!

35
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,000
Shut it for hell.

36
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,500
Yeah!

37
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,020
Why would Cam Clark be in this game?

38
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,780
We killed Liquid!

39
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,380
We killed Liquid!

40
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,880
We killed Liquid!

41
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,780
That's craziness!

42
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,280
Yes!

43
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,080
Yeah!

44
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,650
That's my president!

45
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,770
I love that guy!

46
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,930
You didn't kill Liquid.

47
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,890
Fox died.

48
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,570
Oh, true.

49
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,170
You're right.

50
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,010
Wow, look at these soldiers.

51
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,470
Oh, oh, oh.

52
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,050
Harry, Gregson, Williams!

53
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,450
Williams!

54
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,770
George Sears, my president!

55
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,850
Yeah!

56
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,650
We're still livin'!

57
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,350
We're still livin'!

58
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,030
Whoa!

59
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,610
I voted for that guy.

60
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,670
Whoa, science!

61
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,790
Math!

62
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,870
Yajishiko!

63
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,510
Oh gosh, I'm too excited.

64
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,610
Oh no, I'm too excited!

65
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,610
Yeah, Snake!

66
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,770
What?

67
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:01,790
Who that guy?

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,830
Oh, oh, Snake!

69
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,430
Oh, who that guy?

70
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,990
Who, who that?

71
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,510
Who's that?

72
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,670
Who's that?

73
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,210
Who's that?

74
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,030
What a pretty lady.

75
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,170
Ta-da!

76
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,830
Ta-da!

77
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,630
Oh my gosh!

78
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,570
Oh my gosh!

79
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,050
Hold on, I'll put it at that.

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Oh my gosh!

81
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,440
She's kinda cute, huh?

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,640
Yeah, she's got nice hair.

83
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,940
Andragos, thank you for the 20 gifted!

84
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,360
Ronin, welcome back!

85
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,260
Sir9, welcome back!

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
Brendan, welcome back!

87
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Hello Mint, hello!

88
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,860
Hello, hello, hello.

89
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh my gosh.

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,200
First of all, remember when we did this?

91
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,620
On April 30th?

92
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,920
Yo, you remember what day it is tomorrow?

93
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,440
It's shreddin' time.

94
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,140
No, unfortunately...

95
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,440
Unfortunately, we are not playing during April.

96
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,080
But that's okay.

97
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,560
That's okay.

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,500
It's fine.

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,220
Hold on, I'm gonna turn up the volume just a little bit.

100
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,440
I might be adjusting it throughout the game.

101
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,540
Apologize.

102
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,400
But yeah!

103
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,660
Welcome to Metal Gear Solid 2.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
Which is...

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,560
I've gone back and forth so many times.

106
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,620
On if I really like...

107
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,420
On if 3 or 2 is my favorite.

108
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,520
And even sometimes 4.

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,460
But truly, I think 2 is my favorite.

110
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,680
Out of all the Metal Gear games.

111
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,420
I think...

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,360
I think 2 is my favorite out of all of them.

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,680
I think I, like, think about 2 the most.

114
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,260
I quote 2 the most.

115
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,460
Like, it's just...

116
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,960
I used to be a hardcore, like, 3 is my favorite.

117
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,120
That's why even I got the patchy slot.

118
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,060
But...

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,340
I say I look at it longingly.

120
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,200
I love you, patchy slot machine.

121
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,800
I love you.

122
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,040
I have a confession.

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,280
I didn't actually watch most of your members...

124
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,920
Members stream live yesterday.

125
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,360
I only hopped onto Super Chat when people suggested I should.

126
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,200
Because it'd be funny.

127
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,020
Oh, good!

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,040
Wait, you don't know what was going on then, right?

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,080
Perfect.

130
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,740
Perfect.

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,120
2 is my favorite story, but 5 is my favorite gameplay.

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,780
I think that is most people, right?

133
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,680
Because 5 is, like, the best gameplay, right?

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,340
Save often multiple times in the same area.

135
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,920
No reason.

136
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,980
He went back afterwards?

137
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,660
No!

138
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,840
I think Peace Walker is my favorite.

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,500
Peace Walker is so...

140
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,340
I love Peace Walker 2!

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,860
Peace Walker, I think, is so underrated.

142
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,740
It's so underrated.

143
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,820
I know 2 is, like, a fan favorite, for sure.

144
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,560
And it... I...

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,220
But I believe it's justified.

146
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,980
Everything about this game is, like, perfect.

147
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,940
Everything about this game is perfect.

148
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
Everything about this series is perfect.

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,400
I love this series.

150
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,760
Too bad Peace Walker co-op is dead?

151
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,700
What are you talking about?

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,960
Until we play together, baby!

153
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,500
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,420
You can always play with Minto!

155
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
What about Rose?

156
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,900
She's perfect?

157
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,340
Yes!

158
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,540
Oh my gosh!

159
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,580
Yes!

160
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:05,100
If you have never played Metal Gear Solid 2 or watched anyone play Metal Gear Solid 2, get ready for the soap opera, the drama of your life...

161
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh!

162
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Oh, it's so good!

163
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,580
Oh my god, I eat it up!

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh my god!

165
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,360
It's...

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,740
The drama!

167
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
The tea!

168
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,300
It's so good!

169
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,080
Oh my god, it's so awesome.

170
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,000
My favorite toxic relationship ever.

171
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,020
I love them so much.

172
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,820
I love...

173
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,320
I just...

174
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,020
Like, I can gush about everything in this...

175
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,340
In...

176
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,620
In MGS2.

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
I can gush about everything in Metal Gear Solid, but I can just...

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,980
Did I watch the VOD with a big grin?

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,460
Well, stop!

180
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,220
This is sarcasm, right?

181
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,260
No!

183
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm being 100...

184
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm always serious.

185
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,120
I like the part when Solid Snake has to steal the Declaration of Independence.

186
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,720
I know.

187
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,500
Where do you think they got that movie from?

188
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,300
Nicolas Cage is supposed to...

189
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,280
Is Solid Snake.

190
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,320
Watch Minto play MGS2?

191
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,340
Do it yourself!

192
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,020
I can...

193
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,620
But I can just gush about everything in this...

194
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,000
In this...

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,820
In this game in particular.

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,820
I think it's like the perfect balance of serious...

197
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,300
And goofy...

198
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,340
And...

199
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,040
Like...

200
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,320
Mind...

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,340
Mind...

202
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,860
Everyth...

203
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,320
Mind...

204
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,020
Mind...

205
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,740
Mind...

206
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,920
Mind...

207
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Spending?

208
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,400
Yeah.

209
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,600
It's just...

210
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,680
Too good!

211
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,360
Oh!

212
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,260
Oh!

213
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,040
It's so good.

214
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,480
This game is so good.

215
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,520
I love it.

216
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,580
Mind blowing!

217
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes!

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,300
Are you Richard Ames?

219
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,340
You must be Ames.

220
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,860
I love it.

221
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:42,980
I love it.

222
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,520
It's so great.

223
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,340
So...

224
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,940
It's just...

225
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,000
It's just so good.

226
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,900
I can't get over it.

227
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,700
I'm so excited to be playing it again.

228
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,120
It's also a game that I like...

229
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,620
Pretty much fumble my way through.

230
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm not very good at this game.

231
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,760
So...

232
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm prepared for comments of...

233
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,360
Being like...

234
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,880
Gosh...

235
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,980
Minto is not very good at this game.

236
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,640
But that's...

237
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,600
It doesn't matter.

238
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,400
I have heart.

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,580
I love this game so much.

240
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,700
So...

241
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,660
It doesn't matter.

242
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:11,920
Wait!

243
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,680
Why VTuber?

244
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,220
Why do you love game but you bad at it?

245
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,620
MGS2 is the one I'm worst at too.

246
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,180
I think it like...

247
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,720
Because going from MGS1 to this game...

248
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
It introduces...

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,220
It introduces probably an overwhelming amount of mechanics that are not in MGS1.

250
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,020
But...

251
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,120
In like a good way.

252
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,920
It's just...

253
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,760
I wish I could have played this as a kid.

254
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,040
Because I would have been like...

255
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,820
Actually you know what?

256
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,480
I don't think as a kid I would have appreciated how...

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,160
How...

258
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,740
Uhh...

259
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,000
Advanced this game was.

260
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,760
You know?

261
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,420
I think I wouldn't...

262
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,080
I think I wouldn't under...

263
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,540
I think I wouldn't appreciate it.

264
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,020
I appreciated it as a kid.

265
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,740
Did you really?

266
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,020
Did you say wow this is doing feats and technical advancements?

267
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,260
Okay.

268
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,820
Okay, but I did feel that way about like Kingdom Hearts cutscenes.

269
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,000
I was like, wow, Kingdom Hearts cutscenes look amazing.

270
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,160
They look like the best ever.

271
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
Try to remember the basics of CQC.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,440
No!

273
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,840
There's no CQC here!

274
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,140
I don't think Raiden VR's... VR mission CQC, does he?

275
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,320
If you're not good, a tip.

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,520
Get the thermal goggles.

277
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,000
Little kid got me filtered by vamp.

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,560
Too scary.

279
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,180
Really?

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,980
I didn't really care for this game as a kid, because it was so different.

281
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,540
It definitely aged good though.

282
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
That's the thing about this game, is it aged perfectly.

283
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,200
It can still be played now, and be such a good game.

284
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,800
CQC was censored by the patrons!

285
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,760
I never played this game until much later.

286
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,500
But I remember watching a friend play it the first few days.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,660
When it was new, and this game has always been unbeatably cool.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,540
I know!

289
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,940
Make sure to bring garlic.

290
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,280
Happy 37th anniversary to Metal Gear Vito!

291
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah!

292
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,560
Cool, you're doing a playthrough on PS2.

293
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,960
We got a re-releases, but it's nice to check out the OG platform.

294
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah, so I am playing this on my PS2.

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,760
I'm looking at my baby over there.

296
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,600
And, um...

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah, so...

298
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,880
Someone who played MGS1 is a young'un.

299
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,880
I couldn't even keep up with the characters' names.

300
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm trying to think.

301
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,280
Yeah, like, I don't think...

302
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
I mean, I kept up with Kingdom Hearts.

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,540
So I probably could have done the same for this.

304
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,520
Why is there skateboarding?

305
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
Why isn't there skateboarding?

306
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,200
Why wouldn't there be skateboarding?

307
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,740
Do you have a slim?

308
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,320
I have a slim.

309
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,060
Slim, slim...

310
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,500
Skinny Legend.

311
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,180
Story became more and more relevant as the years went on.

312
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,580
Have fun.

313
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,680
Thank you!

314
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,960
I was so excited!

315
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,060
Happy birthday!

316
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,080
Congratulations!

317
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,020
Happy birthday!

318
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,840
With salutations!

319
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,320
Happy birthday!

320
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,120
May your sky stay blue!

321
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,360
Happy birthday to you!

322
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,620
Okay, I don't want to take up too much time.

323
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,500
Because I can literally just talk about this game right now.

324
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,540
Forever.

325
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,860
So we're going to...

326
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,420
New game!

327
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,180
And I have it in the pinned comment.

328
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,960
But I will say just in case again.

329
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,460
Please, no spoilers in the chat.

330
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,780
I will do my best as well.

331
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,080
I will do my best.

332
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,960
But please no spoilers as much as you can in the chat.

333
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,540
I know we all get very excited.

334
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,220
But just for anybody who is following along in the series.

335
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,360
For the first time.

336
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,100
We just spoiled a lot though.

337
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,880
No we didn't.

338
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,300
And...

339
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,760
Not a ton.

340
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,120
Rap kills Dumbledore.

341
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,740
Yeah, so...

342
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,160
Just do your best, you know?

343
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
I sometimes...

344
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,040
You know, I'm not perfect either.

345
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm pretty perfect.

346
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,060
But I'm not perfect.

347
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm pretty perfect.

348
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,880
But you know.

349
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,460
Hmm.

350
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,920
Tanker plant.

351
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,320
What if I just skip the tanker?

352
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,920
Wouldn't that be...

353
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,120
Wouldn't that be horrible?

354
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,240
Wouldn't that...

355
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,580
What if...

356
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,360
Who is skipping the tanker?

357
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,240
I get it.

358
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,420
You just want to get into the game.

359
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,660
But it just makes me so sad.

360
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,280
Do my best.

361
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,300
Thanks for the five.

362
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,080
I have to thank you.

363
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,040
Do it.

364
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,460
No!

365
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,980
It's messed up.

366
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,800
Speedrunners?

367
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,000
No.

368
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,140
A true speedrunner...

369
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,620
Would play the whole game.

370
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,160
Okay.

371
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,580
Okay.

372
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,100
Where do you guys think it's going to start?

373
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,360
I have five bucks on the Hudson River.

374
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,620
We're going to play on normal.

375
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,100
And radar type two.

376
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,940
Put radar off.

377
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,360
Am I a psycho?

378
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,240
Radar in Sons of Liberty will not appear at all.

379
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,580
This story is fictional, everybody.

380
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,640
Okay?

381
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,920
Any similarities to me?

382
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,060
No.

383
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,800
Or just similarities?

384
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,640
The Hudson River.

385
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,880
Two years ago.

386
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,260
You guys all owe me five dollars.

387
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,360
He had classified intelligence that a new type of metal gear was scheduled for transport.

388
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,580
The whole thing stank.

389
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,000
But our noses have been out in the cold too long.

390
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,320
How did you know?

391
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,720
I love you, Minto Platonic, of course.

392
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,380
Sighs.

393
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,860
I love you, Minto Platonic, of course.

394
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,420
Sighs.

395
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,260
I love

396
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:16,510
you, Minto Platonic.

397
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:16,870
Oh my gosh!

398
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,690
Thank you guys for holding your side of the agreement.

399
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,750
I appreciate it.

400
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,390
Okay.

401
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,730
That's enough.

402
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,130
Thank you.

403
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,790
Thank you, everybody.

404
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,110
Thank you.

405
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,490
Lolilule low tax.

406
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,330
How's the audio?

407
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,330
You win.

408
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,090
Thank you, guys.

409
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,650
Thank you.

410
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,490
Meow.

411
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,410
Who's that?

412
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,950
I'm not.

413
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,670
I'm not.

414
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:45,730
No.

415
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,050
I recognize that gray-blue.

416
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,780
We have to give five dollars?

417
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,680
That's good.

418
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
Just checking if Streamlabs notifications are enabled.

419
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes, they are!

420
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,580
Thank you!

421
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,520
Five bucks.

422
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,220
A bed is a bed.

423
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,960
Thank you.

424
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,980
Thank you for your first ever super chat.

425
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,620
Oh, oh, he's running.

426
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,860
Oh, he's running.

427
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,440
Wow.

428
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,460
He's taking off.

429
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,940
Oh my god.

430
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,660
Um, he's...

431
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh, it's kind of loud.

432
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,540
He's got super powers.

433
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,900
Oh my god, who is that?

434
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,570
This is my actually least favorite part of the game because I'll show... I'll tell you in a second.

435
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,210
How did this hero... Glyph, no!

436
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,890
Thank you.

437
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,810
Whoa!

438
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,590
Whoa, are you okay there?

439
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,530
Oh my god, he's like flipping them.

440
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,850
You all right?

441
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,550
Oh, oh, be careful.

442
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,810
Be careful.

443
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,050
Harry, Gregson, Williams.

444
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,390
I'm a twin IRL?

445
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,290
You are?

446
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,130
That's my least favorite part of the game because now we don't have the stealth camouflage anymore.

447
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,090
Otacon, why is your technology so faulty?

448
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,230
Oh my god, it was Solid Snake the whole time!

449
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,130
It was a night on schedule.

450
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,910
Um.

451
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,390
No, soon enough.

452
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,850
Oh my gosh, it's also loud.

453
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,410
Spinning his little gun as usual.

454
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,940
Hideo Kojima.

455
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,970
Yaaaaaaah.

456
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,730
So cinematic, so awesome, so iconic.

457
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,430
Yaaaaaa!

458
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,890
This is Snake.

459
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,050
Kiss.

460
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,450
Kiss.

461
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,770
Kiss.

462
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,570
Sounds quiet.

463
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,090
Okay.

464
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,110
He accepted the thing!

465
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,990
Why would you call her a nanny?

466
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,030
How is it now?

467
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,450
Is it better?

468
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,850
Ocelot.

469
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,830
Ah!

470
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,970
Could be.

471
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,390
Could be!

472
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,510
Amphibious!

473
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,450
Nuh.

474
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,070
Nuh.

475
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,870
Nuh.

476
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,530
Not in a million years!

477
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,770
Agh!

478
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,210
Okay, we can do that.

479
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:22,910
Okay.

480
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,410
ASAP.

481
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,770
Yeah.

482
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,170
Yeah.

483
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,830
Mm -hmm.

484
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,230
Oh, yeah.

485
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,450
Don't worry.

486
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,850
Don't worry.

487
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,510
Philanthropy!

488
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,310
I love Snake.

489
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,330
He's so silly.

490
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,590
Let's look at your gear.

491
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,170
Your weapon is a tranquilizer gun converted from a Beretta M92F.

492
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:18,790
Yippee!

493
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,510
M9.

494
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,150
M9.

495
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,330
It's a little hard to work with because you have to reload after each shot since the slide locks.

496
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,830
Better than scavenging at the mission site.

497
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,870
Look how happy and engaging you make MGS3s.

498
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,870
The chemical stun will take effect in a few seconds and last for hours.

499
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,490
Thank you.

500
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,170
You can take down an elephant with that thing.

501
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,810
Check out the laser sighting, too.

502
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,350
First person shooting!

503
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,090
Yeah!

504
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,410
I like that they show that you can blow out the light.

505
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,470
As for the equipment...

506
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,830
Hey, Snake?

507
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,470
Yeah?

508
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:50,850
Cigarettes?

509
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,110
What's wrong with you?

510
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,810
It's kind of a lucky charm.

511
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,510
I gotta eat them.

512
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,750
You haven't read the Surgeon General's warning, have you?

513
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,350
The rain's sound is so loud.

514
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:00,810
Here's the digital camera.

515
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,390
It works almost the same way as your old one.

516
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,070
Oh, shoot.

517
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,290
I never picked up the camera before.

518
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,650
Like, I didn't pick it up last time I played.

519
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,270
Yummy cigarettes!

520
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,010
I just need a little snack.

521
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,070
Oh, no.

522
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,250
A snack?

523
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,130
It's like my calorie, mate.

524
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,570
I'm gonna take out that guy.

525
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,930
I'm gonna take out that guy.

526
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,250
You don't look armed.

527
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,230
Hey, Earth to Snake.

528
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,950
These are nice, upstanding Marines, not terrorists.

529
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,230
Oh, I'm not gonna take out these guys.

530
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,650
You're in stealth mode here.

531
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,230
Sure.

532
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,190
And if it comes to that, a little beauty sleep never hurt anyone.

533
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,110
Or a little eternal sleep.

534
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,850
By the way, Otacon, are you sure of this intelligence?

535
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:33,710
Absolutely.

536
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,590
Hacked it out of the Pentagon's classified files myself.

537
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,530
No traces?

538
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,570
Oh, please.

539
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,590
I'm too good for that.

540
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,770
Otacon, speak up.

541
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,050
I can't hear you.

542
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,110
I can't hear you over the rain.

543
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,590
Remember, there's a price on our heads.

544
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,910
You're just being paranoid.

545
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,370
I hope so.

546
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,510
Those men.

547
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,390
You wouldn't think they were anything but civilians for fear.

548
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,170
I went to eternal sleep.

549
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,050
It's not that bad.

550
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,670
With all the ships passing on the river and in the harbor, putting uniformed Marines on the deck would be a bad idea.

551
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,210
Wow.

552
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,750
People can get a clear view of the water from the riverside, too.

553
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,130
Who's getting a clear view at this time of night?

554
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,570
This type of weather?

555
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,950
According to the navigational plans, this ship should have discharged its cargo upriver.

556
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,690
It's all in my kitchen.

557
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,110
It's in there.

558
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,210
No doubt about it.

559
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,030
The military trains you to watch out for.

560
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,670
Also, how huge is this thing?

561
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,810
To have a metal gear on it?

562
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,990
You worry too much.

563
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,070
Where's the target?

564
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,750
Satellite surveillance is a major international pastime these days.

565
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,010
Maybe see it?

566
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,250
No.

567
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,230
Do you see the entrance to the holds?

568
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,070
Yes.

569
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,490
Looks like there are a few entryways into the crew quarters.

570
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:30,990
Okay.

571
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, no.

572
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,620
No!

573
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,900
My upstanding Marines!

574
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,320
Citizen!

575
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,240
No!

576
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,220
No!

577
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,500
No!

578
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,280
Not the upstanding Marines!

579
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,020
No!

580
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,900
Looks like we're not the only ones after metal gear tonight.

581
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,360
Is that a chopper I just heard?

582
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,500
Affirmative.

583
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,980
Probably another cavalry.

584
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,140
Now I can kill them.

585
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,460
It's their game.

586
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,400
Hijack?

587
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,100
They're probably targeting the ship's controls.

588
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,040
Autocon.

589
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,060
How many men do you need to take over a tanker of this size?

590
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,020
The ship is run by a computer, so I'd say about 18 people.

591
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,480
That's a lot of people.

592
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,540
That sounds so small.

593
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,340
That sounds so not enough people for a ship this size.

594
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,270
They're next.

595
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,190
They look weak.

596
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:40,850
Snappable.

597
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,210
I managed to smuggle this map with so much stuff.

598
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,110
Dang, Snake.

599
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,950
You're so judgy.

600
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,350
Just because his hair isn't long and luscious like your mullet.

601
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,150
Oh, it's the hat.

602
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,330
Oh, it's the hat.

603
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:58,510
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,790
Let's get an ID on him ASAP.

605
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,410
I'm on it.

606
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,350
Maybe you should have been like the hat, not the hair.

607
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,690
Why does Snake look so sussy?

608
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,430
The slow turn around is so funny.

609
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,630
Looks like the tanker's theirs now.

610
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,050
Oh, they just took it.

611
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,950
K-60 Kasatka.

612
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,910
Kasatka?

613
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,470
Kasatka?

614
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,530
Kamov chopper, right?

615
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,830
Killer whale.

616
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,130
Coffee?

617
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,510
No.

618
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,910
We need to get a fix on who they are.

619
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,010
But I'm drinking coffee right now.

620
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,570
But I'm drinking coffee right now.

621
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,750
Not necessarily.

622
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,790
It could be the Ka-62.

623
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,090
The civil model.

624
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,250
Look, Snake.

625
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,610
All we need is the photographic evidence of Metal Gear.

626
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,030
As long as we have those, we can put it online and blow the whole thing wide open.

627
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,050
So no pyrotechnics, okay?

628
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:49,990
All right.

629
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,330
I'll do my best.

630
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,110
What?

631
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,330
This isn't like Shadow Moses.

632
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:53,810
I see.

633
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,110
Reach me if anything happens.

634
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,570
I see.

635
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,950
The frequency's 141.12.

636
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,470
What?

637
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,490
What?

638
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,730
How can I check in and save my progress?

639
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,630
I'll do it.

640
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,550
There's a frequency set aside for it.

641
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,390
How can I save my progress?

642
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,690
140.96.

643
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,370
Sorry, but no Mei Ling this time.

644
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,110
Oh, yeah.

645
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,590
Call me on the codec when you want to save.

646
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,190
Right.

647
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,490
Got it.

648
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,930
Right.

649
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,110
I'll be waiting just past the Verrazano Bridge.

650
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:14,810
I'll get right on it.

651
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,570
You need to be off that ship by then.

652
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,630
I'll be in touch.

653
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,620
Oh.

654
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,900
It's me.

655
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm playing now.

656
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,080
It's me, everybody.

657
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:31,960
Welcome.

658
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,660
Welcome.

659
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,460
Welcome.

660
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:33,660
Let's see.

661
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,660
We got our camera.

662
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
We got our AP sensor.

663
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,580
We got our cigarettes, our snack.

664
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,060
Let's see.

665
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,880
We got...

666
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,260
Oh, yeah.

667
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Our M9.

668
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,860
Minto Gaming.

669
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,820
Let's see.

670
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,020
Let's call Otacon.

671
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,320
Push the action button near a scalable railing to hang off the other side.

672
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,680
Oh, yeah.

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,260
This is called hanging.

674
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,760
You can use it to move around, hide, and even maneuver around an enemy's back.

675
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,640
You can move left and right while hanging by moving the left analog stick or using the L2 and R2 buttons.

676
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,040
It's called hanging.

677
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,860
When you're ready to pull yourself up, just push the action button again.

678
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,680
It's called hanging.

679
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,880
A grip gauge appears below the life gauge during hanging.

680
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:23,200
The grip gauge indicates how tightly you're holding on and steadily decreases as long as you're in hanging mode.

681
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,280
Thank you.

682
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,000
Thanks for the brave.

683
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,160
We just started Metal Gear.

684
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,100
When the grip gauge goes to zero, you won't be able to hold on anymore.

685
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,660
We just started.

686
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,400
Welcome out there.

687
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,160
You need to hoist yourself up before you fall off.

688
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,740
Push the crawl button.

689
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,320
While hanging, to jump down straight below.

690
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,080
If the ground is too far below, you'll lose some life.

691
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
In some places, you won't make it at all.

692
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,140
Be careful of that.

693
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,980
Yippie yippie yippie.

694
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,420
Murphy, thanks for the gifted.

695
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's save real quick too.

696
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,020
Now we just see our Otaku Dine in Montreal.

697
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,700
Thank you.

698
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,600
See you there.

699
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,860
Raymac, thanks for the five gifted.

700
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,460
I tested it earlier.

701
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:01,720
It's the same.

702
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,520
So if you see this file, it was just me starting up the game and making sure everything worked.

703
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,500
So I'll just save right over it.

704
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,420
There we go.

705
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,420
Ducky.

706
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Thanks for the gifted.

707
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,000
Snake, you of course know the saying, one for all, all for one.

708
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,440
Yeah.

709
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,760
What is this all of a sudden?

710
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,600
Yippie yippie yippie yippie.

711
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:19,720
Yippie yippie yippie yippie.

712
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,180
Oh, I figured you need a lot of motivation.

713
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,280
So I came prepared.

714
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,780
It's from the three musketeers.

715
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,820
The book, not the candy bar.

716
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,700
Anyway, it means that if you go up against everyone by yourself, they'll gang up on you.

717
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,840
I think.

718
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,260
Since you're on your own on that ship, you need to take this to heart and avoid confrontations.

719
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,640
How is that?

720
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,280
Just like the old days, huh?

721
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,920
He's so cute.

722
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
Almost reminds me of Mei Ling.

723
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,300
But you sure you got it right?

724
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,560
Of course.

725
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,380
What's with this guy?

726
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,600
And I'll teach you a lot more of these.

727
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,460
You can count on it.

728
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,100
Great.

729
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,490
Snake!

730
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,590
How could you say that about Otakars?

731
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,250
Nexy, thank you for the 10 gifted.

732
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,590
Cooper, thanks for the five.

733
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,590
Thank you so much.

734
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,070
You guys.

735
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,470
Thank you.

736
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:05,910
Thank you.

737
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,450
What's with this guy?

738
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,850
Thank you for the 15 gifted.

739
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,450
Thank you so much.

740
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,030
What's with this guy?

741
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:15,710
All right.

742
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:15,990
Let's see.

743
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,370
How do I...

744
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,170
Press square button to aim.

745
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,090
Released with fire.

746
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,790
All right.

747
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,530
So we're going to test that out with the lights here.

748
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,690
And then I go into this mode.

749
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,110
That's right.

750
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,030
All right.

751
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,990
It's going to come back to me eventually.

752
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,340
Where are the lights?

753
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,660
Oh.

754
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:35,940
Oh.

755
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,200
I can take this one out.

756
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:37,920
Oh.

757
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,860
Wait.

758
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,640
How do I...

759
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Where's the light coming from?

760
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,440
There we go.

761
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,620
And...

762
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,100
Oh.

763
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,980
One here too.

764
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,240
Oh.

765
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,960
Thank you for the gifted.

766
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,820
Wait.

767
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,220
Is there a guy here?

768
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,920
Oh.

769
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,520
Our sleepy friend?

770
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,100
Oh.

771
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:05,940
Oh.

772
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,920
Okay.

773
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,900
Let's see.

774
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,320
All right.

775
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,500
This game terrifies me.

776
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,120
I'll be honest.

777
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,040
It's so...

778
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,500
Like I said earlier, the lev...

779
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,140
Oh, shit.

780
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh, my God.

781
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,080
Oh, my God.

782
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh.

783
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,080
Oh.

784
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,880
I should probably be looking at my radar.

785
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:32,580
The level difference from the first game to the second game just like jumps immensely, I believe.

786
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,780
And so it kind of frightens me.

787
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:35,940
Oh.

788
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm getting a little bit...

789
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,160
Just a little bit.

790
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,320
Where did he go anyway?

791
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,240
Grip level two for Otacon boyfriend praise?

792
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,480
Wait.

793
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:49,860
Actually?

794
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,160
Actually?

795
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,780
How do I...

796
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:53,840
Uh.

797
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,300
There we go.

798
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,180
Grip level one.

799
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,140
Oh, wait.

800
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,400
La, la, la, la, la.

801
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,140
La, la, la, la, la.

802
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,700
La, la, la.

803
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,640
A snake has such good grip.

804
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,640
Unlike...

805
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,940
Unlike a certain other...

806
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
How do I do the pull-up?

807
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, you need to do pull-ups.

808
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,580
How do I do it?

809
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,900
That's how you do it!

810
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,700
That was a pull-down.

811
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,280
No!

812
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,040
All the lights are back on!

813
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,920
And this bozo is awake again.

814
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,000
OK, OK.

815
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,940
There we go.

816
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,380
OK.

817
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,900
How do you do it?

818
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,700
That was a dive.

819
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,900
Oh, L2, R2.

820
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,200
Wow!

821
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,380
It's going down so fast!

822
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm working out!

823
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm working out!

824
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,240
Hey, look at him.

825
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,240
He's just showing off at this point.

826
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,940
Everybody, do pull-ups together.

827
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,520
Getting his reps in.

828
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,200
A hundred!

829
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,560
No way!

830
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,320
OK.

831
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,440
We can do this.

832
00:35:59,480 --> 00:35:59,840
We can do this.

833
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,060
You can drop down and catch to another ledge.

834
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,720
Oh, but then I have to go up there, you know?

835
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,580
It's OK.

836
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,720
We're probably at like 50.

837
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,160
We're probably at like 60 now.

838
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,500
We're probably...

839
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,880
70...

840
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,700
71...

841
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,760
72...

842
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,720
73...

843
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,700
74...

844
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,760
I actually have no idea what we're at.

845
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,040
Come on, Sig!

846
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,140
Your stamina!

847
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,980
Your stamina, man!

848
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
I like how this...

849
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,560
doesn't even, like, do anything.

850
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,680
Because we're gonna be, you know...

851
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,900
later on.

852
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,440
This will mean nothing to us.

853
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Totally somewhere around 100.

854
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,360
Armless!

855
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,660
Yeah, later on we'll be armless.

856
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,160
So sad.

857
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,000
So sad.

858
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,260
So sad.

859
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,060
So sad.

860
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,800
So sad.

861
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,280
So sad.

862
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,320
So sad.

863
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,740
So sad.

864
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,360
So sad.

865
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,800
So sad.

866
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,620
One hundred!

867
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,640
S1!

868
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,120
Next to the 10 gifted!

869
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,740
Anyway, this is a Zatsu now.

870
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
We're just yapping about...

871
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:13,940
anything...

872
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
um...

873
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,380
Oh my god!

874
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:19,980
Oh my god!

875
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,240
That was close.

876
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,740
What is this super chat?

877
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,080
Sick gains?

878
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,900
Ring fit stream?

879
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,180
Oh!

880
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,820
You okay, Snake?

881
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,880
You alright?

882
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,120
Did I make it to level 2?

883
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,460
Is that what that meant?

884
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:50,840
Nope.

885
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,440
Anybody keep the gap?

886
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,980
I have been.

887
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,120
Nine...

888
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,880
One hundred.

889
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,480
I did half a pull-up.

890
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,920
Let's go.

891
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,980
Let's go!

892
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,680
You guys, Cole is beating everybody here.

893
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,700
How many pull-ups have you guys done?

894
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,320
Snake has done 2,000 at this point.

895
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,250
One focuses on the main path.

896
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,110
Subsequent runs are for the goofy things like this.

897
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:31,870
Yeah!

898
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,030
We're gonna get peed on!

899
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,350
Wait, is Snake losing health?

900
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,530
No.

901
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,150
Snake, don't lose health.

902
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,090
Zero.

903
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,680
We're gonna get peed on.

904
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
We're gonna...

905
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,660
We're gonna meet...

906
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,680
bisexual people.

907
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,480
I mean, we've already met two.

908
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,280
Um...

909
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,160
We're gonna...

910
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,940
Um...

911
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,880
We're gonna...

912
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,040
What else happens in this game?

913
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,160
We're gonna experience the dud.

914
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,820
Lots of things are gonna happen.

915
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,340
Oh my god.

916
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:20,800
Please!

917
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,600
How many more?

918
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,520
You are at 60 now.

919
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,340
Wait, actually?

920
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,100
I will turn on DVR just so someone can count.

921
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,120
67...

922
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,100
80...

923
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,380
81...

924
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:47,960
82...

925
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,600
83...

926
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,120
Oh my god.

927
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,120
You get fat in this game.

928
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,260
We laugh and we get fat.

929
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,660
It's kind of awesome.

930
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,140
It's so funny.

931
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,480
You know?

932
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,620
Every time I laugh, I get a little fatter.

933
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,020
I think I'm in trouble.

934
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,430
I don't know if some of these are counting.

935
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,530
I don't know if some of these are counting.

936
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,010
What am I at?

937
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,690
Oh my goodness!

938
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,810
I'm overweight because of you.

939
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,090
I'm overweight because of you.

940
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,270
You should have a stomach.

941
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,490
Stop laughing.

942
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:07,930
Stop.

943
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,810
Most probably didn't count?

944
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,430
No way!

945
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,610
Don't say that.

946
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,990
This counts.

947
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,510
I think it counts if it goes faster.

948
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,110
It should count if the...

949
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,350
I'm done with this.

950
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:23,510
Sorry.

951
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:23,610
I'm sorry.

952
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,530
90 already, I think?

953
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,130
Okay.

954
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,790
I'm trusting you, Shiki.

955
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,910
We're going to do 10 more.

956
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:41,630
1... 2... 3... 4... 5!

957
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,090
You're so close, boss.

958
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,550
If laughing makes you fat, our wisps lean because we cry so much.

959
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,250
You need more.

960
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,510
You need to intake so much more salt because you cry so much.

961
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,410
1... 2... 3...

962
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,180
I think you just hit 90?

963
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,220
They were off by 10?

964
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,300
Oh my god.

965
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay, 10 more.

966
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,640
1... 2... 3... 4...

967
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,360
5!

968
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:56,830
1... 2... 3... 4... 5!

969
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,190
10 more.

970
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,970
If not, read this message again.

971
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,100
Oh.

972
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,560
I give up.

973
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,420
Where is that guy?

974
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:18,600
Oh.

975
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:20,740
Oh.

976
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,720
That was weird.

977
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,220
Okay, I have to press down.

978
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,120
Good night!

979
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,060
Good night, sweet prince.

980
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,080
Good night.

981
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,080
Yeah, we don't need a level 2 anyway, I guess.

982
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,280
I'll try it somewhere else.

983
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,440
One thing I do want to improve upon in this, if I can, is...

984
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,940
um... holding people up, shooting radios, stuff of the like.

985
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,940
Is that a guy there?

986
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,660
And then there's this guy over here, right?

987
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,720
Where is he at, anyway?

988
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,700
He's not gonna see me.

989
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,040
He's gonna go, nothing.

990
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Make a pause.

991
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,180
Expred, are you okay?

992
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,780
Are you okay, buddy?

993
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,220
Thank you for the super chat.

994
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,940
Most gamblers give up before reaching.

995
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,120
Oh, he doesn't even come over here!

996
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,240
Can I get him?

997
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,400
Oh, shoot.

998
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,540
Oh.

999
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,580
He didn't even...

1000
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,760
Idiot.

1001
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,380
Didn't even notice.

1002
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,960
What if I get him again?

1003
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,760
Am I even shooting his body?

1004
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,200
I can't even tell.

1005
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,720
Maybe I'm hitting the wall.

1006
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,360
I can't tell.

1007
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:01,820
Oh!

1008
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,800
Good night!

1009
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,340
Good night!

1010
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,140
Oh, um...

1011
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,800
Uh, okay.

1012
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,320
Oh, here we go.

1013
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,120
La la la la la la!

1014
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,660
I'm gonna throw him overboard.

1015
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,740
How do I do that?

1016
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,240
Scourge, thanks for the gift tin!

1017
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,580
How do I throw him overboard?

1018
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,640
He's not giving me anything good.

1019
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,060
Oh, there...

1020
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,920
Okay, now he definitely deserves to go overboard.

1021
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,440
Oh, the gate!

1022
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:42,840
That's right.

1023
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,900
This way!

1024
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,220
This way, buddy!

1025
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,260
You're going into the box!

1026
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,540
The box!

1027
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,280
The box!

1028
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
You're going to the box!

1029
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,200
There you go!

1030
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,580
Good night!

1031
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,140
Is there anything over here?

1032
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,940
Just so good!

1033
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,860
Thank you for the box!

1034
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,820
I won't scatter your sorrow to the heartless...

1035
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:12,240
You know, just...

1036
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,800
You know...

1037
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,400
Just, uh...

1038
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,060
My bad.

1039
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,060
I'm not... I'm not scattering your...

1040
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,620
I won't... I won't do... I...

1041
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,670
I won't do it.

1042
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:32,830
I won't do it.

1043
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,130
I won't do it.

1044
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:39,100
I won't... I won't do it.

1045
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,320
I won't do it.

1046
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,280
This guy show up over here?

1047
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,500
Maybe not.

1048
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,360
Oh, he's asleep!

1049
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,480
Let's, um...

1050
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,580
Take it...

1051
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:49,920
Uh...

1052
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,500
Well, he's got three still, but...

1053
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,420
We'll just give him a little extra boost.

1054
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,060
What do you have for me, mister?

1055
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,400
If you have nothing, then you're going to the gate.

1056
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,040
You've got...

1057
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,400
You've got...

1058
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,380
Uh...

1059
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:06,540
Good night!

1060
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,880
To the gate, to the gate, to the gate...

1061
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,160
To the gate, to the gate, to the gate...

1062
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,340
Have mercy!

1063
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,020
I lied.

1064
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,600
I'm a vengeful ghost.

1065
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Wait, where's the staircase?

1066
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,680
Over here.

1067
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,600
I think.

1068
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,820
Yeah.

1069
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,880
His poor head.

1070
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,660
Fine,

1071
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,720
I'm committing murder.

1072
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,000
To the gate, to the gate...

1073
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You're going to the gate...

1074
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,660
To the gate...

1075
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,980
Have a safe trip...

1076
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,680
See you next fall...

1077
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,900
To the ocean you go...

1078
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,220
Okay.

1079
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,860
Otacon, what were you saying?

1080
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,600
What was so important?

1081
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,220
Oh.

1082
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,940
Snake, go through that door into the ship's interior.

1083
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:34,900
Okay.

1084
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,040
Push the action button down in front of the door and wait until the door opens before letting go.

1085
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,280
Okay.

1086
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,080
If you need to open the door faster, hit the action button repeatedly...

1087
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,060
while you turn the handle.

1088
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,500
Got it.

1089
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,580
Make sure you keep doing it until the door is open.

1090
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,000
Okay.

1091
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,720
Thanks, Otacon.

1092
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,280
Actually, what if I...

1093
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,800
One...

1094
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,200
Two...

1095
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,520
Three...

1096
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,300
Four...

1097
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,460
Five...

1098
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,460
Six...

1099
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,300
Okay.

1100
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,420
Push-ups?

1101
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:16,620
No.

1102
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,660
Pull-ups!

1103
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,540
One...

1104
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,340
Now we can fall down.

1105
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,360
Three...

1106
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,840
Look at the butt.

1107
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,070
The ashes.

1108
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,230
They are ashes.

1109
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,710
What's going on?

1110
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,480
Come on, Snake.

1111
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,910
How's your day been, Minto?

1112
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,110
It's been alright.

1113
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,750
I woke up kind of late.

1114
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,850
But I woke up...

1115
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,130
Matara and I were supposed to record for the podcast.

1116
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,870
So we were going to record the Patreon episode.

1117
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:12,910
And she was like...

1118
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,210
We were going to record at 11 a.m.

1119
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:15,590
EST.

1120
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,130
She...

1121
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,470
We ended up not recording until 1.

1122
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,050
Because she fell back to sleep.

1123
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,750
So, yeah.

1124
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,650
Rip Mata.

1125
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,410
Rest in pieces.

1126
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,250
I don't...

1127
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,930
Are we ever going to get grip level two?

1128
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,970
I don't believe this is real.

1129
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm going in.

1130
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,990
Next pull-up for sure.

1131
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,610
I remember there's a guy that, like, goes down here, right?

1132
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:08,850
Man.

1133
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,830
Hey.

1134
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:10,570
Does he come through here?

1135
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:11,810
Actually, I don't remember.

1136
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,290
Oh wait.

1137
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,470
Oh no, he just kind of...

1138
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,770
I can go in here.

1139
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:24,350
Jackpot!

1140
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,890
This reminds me of when we first met.

1141
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,290
I was the one inside the locker that time.

1142
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:46,750
We're equal now, huh?

1143
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,770
Not unless I wet my pants.

1144
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,970
That's a low blow, Snake.

1145
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,530
That's a long blow, Snake.

1146
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,190
Push the action button once more to get out of the locker.

1147
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,390
You can see out from the slit in the door.

1148
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,390
Make sure you check the area using first person view before you go out.

1149
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:14,890
If you

1150
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,280
open the locker, you can use the door to open it.

1151
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,420
The door is a cover during an exchange of gunfire.

1152
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,860
But of course, this is a pretty flimsy door.

1153
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,100
There are limits to how many bullets it can withstand.

1154
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,420
Don't count on it too much, okay?

1155
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,440
That was a kiss?

1156
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,120
Oh.

1157
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,420
Why is...

1158
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,160
Otacon, come on, say the thing.

1159
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,260
Go take a photo.

1160
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,920
Push the action button...

1161
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,460
That's right, it's gotta be a photo.

1163
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:58,720
Oh.

1164
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,200
Whoa.

1165
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,540
Whoa.

1166
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,860
Whoa.

1167
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,640
Um...

1168
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,080
Wait.

1169
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,560
Why won't it let me open up my menu?

1170
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,020
Do I have to...

1171
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,280
Wait.

1172
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,940
She's so cute.

1173
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,560
There we go.

1174
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,910
Maybe it'll let me now?

1175
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,410
Unless I do it here.

1176
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,590
Oh, yeah, baby.

1177
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,430
Wait, how do I take it?

1178
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,710
Uh, oh.

1179
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,210
Square, okay.

1180
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,560
What do you think, Otacon?

1181
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,580
What do you think you're doing, Snake?

1182
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,660
You don't have enough to keep you busy?

1183
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,180
Try to remember the mission if you can.

1184
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,160
What do you think you're doing, Snake?

1185
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,180
You don't have enough to keep you busy?

1186
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,860
You and your hyperactive libido.

1187
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:35,680
Oh, sorry.

1188
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,880
I can't stop staring at this girl's... Sorry, madam.

1189
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,280
Ration!

1190
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,720
I haven't been gifting the last two times you got gifts.

1191
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,600
Liquid scourge?

1192
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,940
Liquid?

1193
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,620
Oh, oh my god.

1194
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,840
I

1195
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,430
don't know why they never open up for me.

1196
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,770
Oh, oh no!

1197
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,220
Okay, we're good.

1198
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,040
We're still good.

1199
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,960
Hello?

1200
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,880
Open up.

1201
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,740
What's inside?

1202
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,760
Anything?

1203
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,660
Anything of use?

1204
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:43,300
That's so cool that you can like even do this, you know?

1205
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,860
That's so fun.

1206
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,280
Good night, sweet princess.

1207
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,380
The last one has a poster too?

1208
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,800
This one?

1209
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,500
Hi!

1210
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:17,180
Hey yeah.

1211
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,580
Who do you think you're doing, Snake?

1212
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,700
You don't have enough to keep you busy.

1213
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,240
Try to remember the mission if you can.

1214
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,080
I'm sorry.

1215
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,780
Her face is up here.

1216
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,240
She does have a really beautiful face.

1217
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,220
Wait, where's my other picture?

1218
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,740
Oh... sorry.

1219
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,380
I can't stop taking them, my bad.

1220
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,630
I over-wrote it?

1221
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:45,010
I did?

1222
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:51,670
No... Here, we'll... We'll overwrite this one.

1223
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,470
Sorry, I'm still trying to get used to the commands.

1224
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,470
Because they're different from the first.

1225
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,690
There we go.

1226
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:05,750
Still too close?

1227
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,370
Why am I too close?

1228
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,070
Step back?

1229
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,570
I'm getting the goods!

1230
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,430
What are you talking about?

1231
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:12,890
Okay, okay.

1232
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,330
Hold on, let me shut this door.

1233
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,060
Lovely lighting.

1234
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,420
Good.

1235
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:34,900
Good.

1236
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,420
Good.

1237
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,780
See those lockers?

1238
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,180
That's a good place to hide yourself if you're in a pinch.

1239
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,500
Push the action button near the locker to open the door.

1240
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,600
Walk inward for a quick concealment.

1241
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,920
Push the action button once more to get out of the locker.

1242
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,080
You can see out from the slit in the door.

1243
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,120
Make sure you check the area using first person view before you go out.

1244
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,960
You can also hide enemies you've knocked out in the locker.

1245
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,780
I love doing that!

1246
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,360
Just open the locker, then drag the body to the locker.

1247
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:05,980
Then they'll be asleep.

1248
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,030
Let's shut this one too.

1249
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,990
Let's get another perfect picture.

1250
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,860
Overwrite this one.

1251
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,320
Good.

1252
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,040
Oh, there it is.

1253
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,620
Yes, Snake, I know.

1254
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,380
My photography is impeccable.

1255
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,720
Hmm...

1256
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,720
Scary!

1257
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,580
Nice rule of thirds.

1258
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,240
Thank you.

1259
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,220
Just gonna...

1260
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,400
I gotta learn how to hold these guys up.

1261
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,040
You don't look very comfortable, mister.

1262
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,080
I'll help you, I'll help you.

1263
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:13,380
Come here.

1264
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,240
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,460
This is the best angle of the game.

1266
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,260
Hey, give me your stuff.

1267
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,360
To the gate?

1268
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:25,820
No!

1269
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,560
Oh, thank you.

1270
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,700
Do not knock on the posters when you lean on them.

1271
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,840
Wait, what do you mean?

1272
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,760
What do you mean by that?

1273
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,320
Come here.

1274
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,620
You're going into the closet.

1275
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,920
You're going into the closet!

1276
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,160
Not with the sexy lady though, she's mine.

1277
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,460
This one.

1278
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,000
Sorry, you don't get a view.

1279
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,060
Come here, come here, come here.

1280
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,960
Come here, come here, come here.

1281
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,600
Come here, come here.

1282
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,460
In you go.

1283
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:00,940
Good night.

1284
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:08,930
What about this one?

1285
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:13,290
Wait.

1286
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,740
The other poster.

1287
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,560
Yeah, I'm on it.

1288
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,390
Move your hand over the center.

1289
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,730
Sensitive!

1290
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:39,330
Take!

1291
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,500
Oh, this goes outside.

1292
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,880
I would have caused an alert if the guard wasn't knocked out.

1293
01:01:59,180 --> 01:01:59,420
No.

1294
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,060
No.

1295
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:00,320
No.

1296
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:01,900
No.

1297
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:10,720
I like how erratic the camera angling is.

1298
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,420
It feels like I'm really playing.

1299
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,420
So there's that guy.

1300
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,340
Cool.

1301
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,880
Thank you Nexidaw for the membership.

1302
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,940
Okay, there's the two of them.

1303
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,060
I thought there was a guy upstairs.

1304
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:32,800
Am I...

1305
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,360
Am I...

1306
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,580
Silly?

1307
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,560
Maybe I'm silly.

1308
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,960
I think if I get him...

1309
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
When he's over there...

1310
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,880
He doesn't notice.

1311
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,240
What the hell?

1312
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,200
Stop turning!

1313
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,260
Oh my god.

1314
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,200
Stop turning!

1315
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,240
What am I gonna do with you?

1316
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,020
I'm just gonna put him over here.

1317
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:05,760
I guess.

1318
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:14,970
What do you give?

1319
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,370
What kind of snacks do you have?

1320
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,870
Put in the sexy lady pose?

1321
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,890
The blocker?

1322
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:24,770
No!

1323
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,830
That's my heaven!

1324
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,190
That's my place!

1325
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:31,470
Oh.

1326
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,440
Beep beep.

1327
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:37,920
Oh.

1328
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,260
To be honest, I don't quite remember where to go.

1329
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,920
I remember...

1330
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,440
Like I need to...

1331
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,040
There's a bomb.

1332
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,100
I remember...

1333
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,220
Oh.

1334
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,020
There's that guy's shadow right there.

1335
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,560
I remember...

1336
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,400
I remember where I need to go because we need to fight Olga.

1337
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,120
Going up.

1338
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:02,420
Yeah.

1339
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:02,900
To Olga.

1340
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,800
I see him there.

1341
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,440
Is this where I'm supposed to...

1342
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,700
I'm

1343
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,640
afraid I'm not gonna hold this guy up.

1344
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:24,860
Oh.

1345
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,480
Oh.

1346
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:31,980
Otacon!

1347
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,120
I'm scared.

1348
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,540
Hold my hand.

1349
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,500
Did you say that locker was your outer heaven?

1350
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:36,960
Yeah.

1351
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,540
This cave is so scary.

1352
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,080
The enemy might spot your shadow.

1353
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:43,820
So you want to be careful.

1354
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,360
You gotta watch out.

1355
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:44,740
I know.

1356
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,700
Turns and corners are especially dangerous.

1357
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,200
I know.

1358
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,640
But the same holds for the enemy.

1359
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,960
If you spot someone's shadow ahead, you can avoid unnecessary risks.

1360
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,660
This game is so advanced.

1361
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,020
Just walk...

1362
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,760
Just get past the corner and hold him up.

1363
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,100
So I just like walk up and I just go...

1364
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:04,980
I just go...

1365
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,820
Freeze.

1366
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:06,800
Right?

1367
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,500
But how do you...

1368
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,580
I don't remember actually.

1369
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,800
How do you run with the...

1370
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,040
Oh.

1371
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:13,820
Oh.

1372
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,760
With the gun.

1373
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,340
I can't remember.

1374
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,220
L1 to move an aim.

1375
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:23,740
Oh.

1376
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,160
Thank you.

1377
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,080
What if I go up to him?

1378
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:29,660
Like this.

1379
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,200
Freeze.

1380
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,020
Freeze.

1381
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,560
Oh.

1382
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,120
Oh shoot.

1383
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:32,600
Oh.

1384
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:34,920
Um.

1385
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,040
It didn't work.

1386
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:39,620
Um.

1387
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,020
Dang it.

1388
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:42,960
Uh.

1389
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,980
You have to pull the gun up.

1390
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,400
Oh.

1391
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,820
So I come at him and then I...

1392
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,100
And then I go...

1393
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:47,860
And then I pull it up.

1394
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,220
Flawless.

1395
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:52,600
Okay.

1396
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:53,600
Again.

1397
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,420
The commands in this one are still a little...

1398
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,700
A little for me.

1399
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,520
You know what I mean?

1400
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,430
So if I...

1401
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:14,730
Okay.

1402
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:15,050
Hold on.

1403
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,550
He's not gonna see me, right?

1404
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,520
You'll get the hang of it, I believe.

1405
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,320
Oh.

1406
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:25,860
Oh.

1407
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:26,660
Oh.

1408
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:26,900
Hold on.

1409
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,800
I'm gonna wait for him to come back.

1410
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:28,500
Sorry.

1411
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,940
I'm being a baby because I want to get used to the controls again.

1412
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,520
Foxy is still in Pirate's Cove.

1413
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,280
So if I do this...

1414
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,060
Freeze.

1415
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,300
Freeze.

1416
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,440
Yeah.

1417
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,780
And then I...

1418
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,240
Shake for me, baby.

1419
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:56,660
Shake for me.

1420
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,520
Shake for me.

1421
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,540
Shake for me, little...

1422
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:00,760
Yeah!

1423
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:05,520
Shake for me.

1424
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:09,460
Okay.

1425
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,380
Thank you.

1426
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:12,700
Good night.

1427
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,140
Oh, we got some chop grenades.

1428
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,230
Oh, wait.

1429
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,430
Do I have to put the...

1430
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,730
Do I have to open this up first?

1431
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:29,450
I think so.

1432
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:30,310
Hold on.

1433
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:32,470
Okay.

1434
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,490
Okay.

1435
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:33,890
Okay.

1436
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,210
Oh.

1437
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:35,550
Oosp.

1438
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,090
I gotta get the oosp first.

1439
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,830
Good night.

1440
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,490
I guess we'll never get the oosp, but that's okay.

1441
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:46,430
Or we'll never...

1442
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:46,550
Oh.

1443
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,990
Oh, I did just see a rash in there.

1444
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:50,670
Oh, my goodness.

1445
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,910
Let's go this way.

1446
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:58,790
Does this go up?

1447
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,090
Yes.

1448
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:00,730
Oh, wait.

1449
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:00,970
What's...

1450
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,690
This goes outside.

1451
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,070
Ew, it's wet.

1452
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:04,190
Oh, no.

1453
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,190
We gotta go to the other side.

1454
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:05,710
Just kidding.

1455
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,350
Okay.

1456
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,340
Okay.

1457
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,360
It's only got two.

1458
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:15,880
So...

1459
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:17,480
Good night.

1460
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,920
Too late for all the dog tags.

1461
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,660
No, I don't focus on stuff like that, you know?

1462
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,040
I just kind of like to chill and have fun with the game.

1463
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,820
I'm not focusing on like getting all the dog tags or anything like that.

1464
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,060
So, getting all the dog tags is the worst.

1465
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,800
Yeah, I don't...

1466
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,340
Really...

1467
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,200
Care to?

1468
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,280
So...

1469
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,860
One more super before I eat.

1470
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,000
Please go to sleep.

1471
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,480
Forgot how I got here but I'm glad I never left.

1472
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,800
Ah, thank you.

1473
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,180
Did I get it?

1474
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,600
I don't think I got it, did I?

1475
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:58,420
No.

1476
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:58,780
It's...

1477
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,220
How...

1478
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,500
How did that not work?

1479
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:04,840
Oh...

1480
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,960
Oh, it's a triangle.

1481
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,280
Sorry.

1482
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,620
Oh.

1483
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,460
I have a...

1484
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,020
I have a...

1485
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,340
You know.

1486
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,000
I don't have a...

1487
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,860
You know...

1488
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,380
You can just say...

1489
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,160
It's fine.

1490
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,320
It's fine.

1491
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,200
We're sneaking past.

1492
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,020
We're sneaking past.

1493
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,960
We're very sneaky.

1494
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,600
More chaffs.

1495
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,490
Yeah, I do have a chaff.

1496
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:37,790
Oh!

1497
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,160
Oh-ho-ho!

1498
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,480
My favorite angle, baby!

1499
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,020
The camera is asleep now.

1500
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,680
Relatable.

1501
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:56,040
I think it's up here that I'm thinking of.

1502
01:09:58,570 --> 01:09:59,490
Surveillance camera.

1503
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,720
All the rations.

1504
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,620
Oh my gosh.

1505
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,680
Scared the heck out of me.

1506
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,520
How many rations do I have?

1507
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,100
I don't even know.

1508
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,460
Oh come on, I'm scared!

1509
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,680
Oh my god, it's puny!

1510
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:26,360
Blast from the hole?

1511
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:28,720
Ooh.

1512
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,000
Otacon, I'm saving.

1513
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:35,780
Yeah.

1514
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,180
Boiled.

1515
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,880
Yeah, burn someone else's skin off.

1516
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,560
Yeah, we're gonna boil.

1517
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,160
We're gonna boil the soldiers.

1518
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,640
Also, do you love that it's January 1st, 2000?

1519
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:51,640
Huh!

1520
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,940
Even a bird on high dies a gluttonous death, as do the fish of the deeps.

1521
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,560
The lesson is, uh, don't be greedy.

1522
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,940
The fish that belonged to a family called the deeps died from overfeeding.

1523
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,660
The deeps?

1524
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,720
And so did a bird that got high on something.

1525
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,520
Probably fermented fruit.

1526
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,760
Okay, if you say so.

1527
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:13,780
I do, Snake.

1528
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,820
He just believes in me.

1529
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,680
Don't take unnecessary risks just because you're greedy for more items.

1530
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,060
Hey!

1531
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,800
Remember the deep family's fish.

1532
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,520
Eh.

1533
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,780
Snake just being like, alright, buddy.

1534
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,980
Yeah, you... yeah.

1535
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,500
Yeah, whatever you say, man.

1536
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,880
I love it.

1537
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,560
It's so cute.

1538
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,880
Did they come back in here?

1539
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:35,700
I can't remember.

1540
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,640
Remember the family fish, everybody.

1541
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,820
Snake is just like, eh?

1542
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,240
Okay.

1543
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,260
This isn't where the bomb is, is it?

1544
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,240
Oh, it is!

1545
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,920
It is where the bomb is.

1546
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,440
Oh my gosh!

1547
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,140
Wait, then I can get the box in here, right?

1548
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,600
Oh, I missed it.

1549
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,280
Sorry, Otacon.

1550
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,980
I'm getting a box.

1551
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:21,840
I'm an orange!

1552
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:22,720
I'm an orange!

1553
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:25,820
I'm an orange.

1554
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:26,540
I'm an orange.

1555
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,660
I'm an orange!

1556
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,160
I'm an orange!

1557
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:28,640
I'm an orange!

1558
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,120
I'm an orange!

1559
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,900
I'm an orange.

1560
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,180
Just an orange!

1561
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,080
Just an orange!

1562
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,640
Maybe I can hold them up afterwards.

1563
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,880
Okay, I'm gonna do my best.

1564
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,620
Actually, I know I'm gonna mess it up.

1565
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,140
I'm scared.

1566
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:05,860
Sleepy time?

1567
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,180
Sleepy time.

1568
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,630
What is this?

1569
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:31,790
Oh, nice.

1570
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:34,610
Where are you anyway?

1571
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,370
Shoot the flower?

1572
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:39,670
Does it actually do anything?

1573
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:44,890
Just putting you right over here.

1574
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:47,010
From sleepy to like...

1575
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,630
You ain't waking up sleepy.

1576
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,940
Advanced EEP.

1577
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,320
Semtex?

1578
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,180
Not Semtex!

1579
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,080
Oh my god, the deep fishes!

1580
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:34,740
Oh my god, the deep fishes!

1581
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,260
Oh my god, the deep fishes!

1582
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,500
My cigarettes?

1583
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:38,820
Oh.

1584
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,980
Otacon's having me be all, you know, Otacon's having me be all, you know, healthy and such.

1585
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,340
And does this guy come over here?

1586
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,660
Oh my god.

1587
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,980
What if I do...

1588
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,960
Do I shoot here?

1589
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,120
Ah, I can't see anything!

1590
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,420
La la la.

1591
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,380
La la la la la.

1592
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,780
La la la.

1593
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,580
La la la la la.

1594
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,800
Give me your stuff!

1595
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,040
Your little weenie!

1596
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,740
I'm putting you in jail!

1597
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,780
Oh, never mind.

1598
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,860
I don't want to go out there.

1599
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,620
Hey!

1600
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,040
Give me your stuff!

1601
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,960
Make him trigger the bomb?

1602
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,820
I'll die too with him!

1603
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:43,940
Will I not?

1604
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,600
No alerts!

1605
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,100
Let's go!

1606
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,380
You will.

1607
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,460
Word!

1608
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,660
You will.

1609
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,600
You just want to see me dead.

1610
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,600
I'm already dead, though.

1611
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,840
Amazing, you're the best!

1612
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,600
Hee hee!

1613
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,840
I played it pretty safe, though.

1614
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,000
I played it pretty safe, though.

1615
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,420
So it is the Casatka.

1616
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,500
The Casatka!

1617
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,300
The Casatka!

1618
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,240
They upgraded from the Hindie.

1619
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,480
Can

1620
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,570
you please...

1621
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,740
I hope there's at least one hot lady among you.

1622
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,260
It's raining men.

1623
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:47,800
Hallelujah.

1624
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,300
Good thing we got inside before they were spying on us.

1625
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,920
A front E.

1626
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,380
We're suffering severe lack of girl boss right now.

1627
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:12,760
It's true.

1628
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,280
It's true.

1629
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,580
I need a lady who's not...

1630
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,360
God, sorry.

1631
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
I can't stop looking at his butt.

1632
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,380
I need a lady who's not gonna treat me right.

1633
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,760
I understand.

1634
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,580
Where you going, Autoclip?

1635
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:48,420
Bye.

1636
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,280
They look really sneaky right now.

1637
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,100
They look like they're crouching.

1638
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,460
What was that?

1639
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,480
Nothing here.

1640
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,920
Nothing here.

1641
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:21,740
Oh.

1642
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,260
Where do I get the USP from?

1643
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,880
Do I get it after this fight?

1644
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,520
Don't worry, we're gonna tranq her though.

1645
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:32,880
Where'd she go?

1646
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,160
Where'd she go?

1647
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:39,860
Pretty lady.

1648
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,180
Oh no, she's hoi.

1649
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,220
Hot even.

1650
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,520
You can't get it before this fight.

1651
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1652
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:52,760
Okay.

1653
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,700
What if I go out this way?

1654
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:57,980
Okay.

1655
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,020
Okay game, I understand.

1656
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,760
I understand what you're puttin' down.

1657
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,480
I don't understand what you're puttin' down.

1658
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:17,870
Oh, Shellushaska!

1659
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:18,690
We know that guy!

1660
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:21,910
Control Room.

1661
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:24,410
Communications and engine room are under control.

1662
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,110
All entry and exit points of the tanker hold secured.

1663
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,650
Operational.

1664
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:34,010
Explosives?

1665
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,690
Scuttled!

1666
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,190
Yeah!

1667
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:54,850
Not yet!

1668
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,110
Not yet!

1669
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,030
Ooh!

1670
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:13,350
Look how he's just like, just become American, man!

1671
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,590
Father!

1672
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,170
Olga!

1673
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,630
Pregnant!

1674
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,140
Wee!

1675
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,400
And she's like, get out of here!

1676
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,160
Get it out of...

1677
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,900
Or she's doing the most awkward wave you've ever seen.

1678
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,080
Freeze!

1679
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:44,840
Yeah!

1680
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,920
Hands over your head, now!

1681
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,000
I've seen a live dubbing of this scene before.

1682
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:54,640
Toss your gun overboard, slowly.

1683
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:57,840
Choo!

1684
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,380
Freeze.

1685
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,680
A woman.

1686
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,060
Show your face.

1687
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,660
You men, you're all the same.

1688
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,660
Who are you?

1689
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,840
Oh, guys, that was awesome!

1690
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,700
We are nomads.

1691
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,120
Wanderers.

1692
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,860
I said don't move.

1693
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:21,960
Americans.

1694
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,420
But you shoot women, too.

1695
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,880
I'm a nomad, too.

1696
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:27,800
Yeah.

1697
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,640
What else do you have there?

1698
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,340
Take the knife and toss it.

1699
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,900
The pits.

1700
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,620
Not there.

1701
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,680
It actually, I feel like it suits her.

1702
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,580
Like, it looks good.

1703
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,660
She just looks so good.

1704
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,380
Hold that position.

1705
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,840
Now, turn around.

1706
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,760
You know what you're doing.

1707
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,560
She's just so awesome.

1708
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,340
She's tough.

1709
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,300
I know.

1710
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,020
I love that.

1711
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:55,860
I love that.

1712
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,240
Whoa.

1713
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,380
It stopped raining.

1714
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,300
Not too shabby, is it?

1715
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,240
New York, I mean.

1716
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,300
How do you reload that?

1717
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,760
I guess there's some way to.

1718
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,440
Oh.

1719
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:18,500
Ah!

1720
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,160
And that brings our duel to its conclusion.

1721
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,200
Scout knife with a surprise.

1722
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,640
You're a Spetsnaz.

1723
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,440
You're a Spetsnaz!

1724
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,220
I think you deserve a little credit.

1725
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,400
No one's ever dodged that shot of mine.

1726
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,620
But no one gets lucky twice, either.

1727
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,060
Yeah.

1728
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,660
I'm gonna...

1729
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,140
I'm gonna get hit.

1730
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:36,540
That's okay.

1731
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,120
She didn't expect to, like, you know...

1732
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,360
Oh.

1733
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,020
Oh, gosh.

1734
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,240
Okay.

1735
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,040
She didn't...

1736
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:48,720
Okay.

1737
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,020
I have to remember how to do this again.

1738
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,020
Ah, let's see.

1739
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,760
I know that I gotta...

1740
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:52,940
Oh!

1741
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,180
I've been with a punitive mind.

1742
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:55,480
Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.

1743
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,900
I grew up on the battlefield.

1744
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,420
Conflict and victory were my parents.

1745
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,620
You just talked to your dad.

1746
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,440
The unit is my life.

1747
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,160
My family.

1748
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,280
I don't wanna hear it.

1749
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,300
We've shared everything.

1750
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,540
On the bad and on the good.

1751
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,420
I don't wanna hear it.

1752
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:09,640
I can't know why.

1753
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,200
Nothing is stopping me now.

1754
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,780
Oh, my God.

1755
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,160
Girlie?

1756
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,440
Nothing else matters to me.

1757
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,380
We, uh, both got each other?

1758
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,000
You're

1759
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,620
non -stopping us.

1760
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:29,660
Oh.

1761
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,820
It showed me the light.

1762
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,540
It was just like, hey, uh, buddy.

1763
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,140
Hey.

1764
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,860
You might wanna, like, you know, do that.

1765
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,420
Where are you going?

1766
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,320
Can I get it now?

1767
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:49,400
Or...

1768
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,160
I'm actually not even sure.

1769
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,780
Did she throw?

1770
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,720
Did she throw?

1771
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,760
Olga, did you throw that?

1772
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:14,500
Oh.

1773
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,280
I need you to be honest with me, okay?

1774
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,400
Can I get her from there?

1775
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:19,600
Oh.

1776
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:20,960
Oh.

1777
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,700
I got her, too, somehow.

1778
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,400
Oh,

1779
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:34,960
that was close.

1780
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:35,820
Oh.

1781
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,540
Oh.

1782
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,500
It's okay.

1783
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,360
I can get it, too.

1784
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:07,660
Uh.

1785
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:08,900
Can I actually?

1786
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:09,540
Uh.

1787
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,400
Where do I get it from?

1788
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,210
Yeah.

1789
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,830
You thought.

1790
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,910
You thought you could.

1791
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,210
You thought you were so slick.

1792
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:24,650
Hey, Olga.

1793
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,330
You thought.

1794
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,490
You thought you were so slick.

1795
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,220
Did she come over here?

1796
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,940
Can I even reach her?

1797
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:37,280
Ah.

1798
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:37,640
Ah.

1799
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:38,160
Ah.

1800
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,000
Ah.

1801
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,700
Now you're just showing off.

1802
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:48,980
You're literally just showing off.

1803
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:01,680
Okay.

1804
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,580
You're all back on this side?

1805
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,340
I got her.

1806
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:04,460
I got her.

1807
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,380
I got her.

1808
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,540
Get the shot.

1809
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,380
Do a flip.

1810
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,500
Where is she?

1811
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,300
She'll pop up.

1812
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:12,500
Oh.

1813
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:12,860
There she is.

1814
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,640
Oh.

1815
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,640
Oh, my God.

1816
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:18,380
Where

1817
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,200
did she go?

1818
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:29,460
Oh.

1819
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,040
She's over there.

1820
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:55,900
We're being rude.

1821
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,100
We'll just hold on to this for now.

1822
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,640
Good aim, Minto.

1823
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,060
Minto.

1824
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,100
Stop being sarcastic.

1825
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,300
I don't need your sass.

1826
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,940
I don't need your sass.

1827
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,320
Please.

1828
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,700
This is a mess.

1829
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:37,800
This is a mess.

1830
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,300
Lay down, Snake.

1831
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,760
Take a breather, buddy.

1832
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,140
That was my fault.

1833
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,820
My timing was completely off.

1834
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,260
It's okay.

1835
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,920
My timing was just off.

1836
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:50,980
Completely.

1837
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,620
Don't do it.

1838
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,160
Something pull me once.

1839
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,930
You zigged when you should have zagged.

1840
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:18,430
I know.

1841
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,070
Distracted by armpits.

1842
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:23,750
It's true.

1843
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,050
Walkie, walkie, walkie, walkie.

1844
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,690
Walkie, walkie, walkie, walkie, walkie, walkie.

1845
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,450
That sure was a fight.

1846
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:39,410
Your child will be fine.

1847
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:40,770
Probably.

1848
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,490
Oh god!

1849
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:43,110
We killed her!

1850
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,450
I thought this was...

1851
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,290
Don't eat too many tranquilizers.

1852
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,190
Tranquilizers, you guys.

1853
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,090
We got a nice...

1854
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:57,630
Her child.

1855
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,340
Her child is not fine.

1856
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,260
Her child is fine.

1857
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,820
Cypher.

1858
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:15,470
It looks like R2-D2.

1859
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,090
And like a little floaty.

1860
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:18,770
Cypher?

1861
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:19,610
Cypher?

1862
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,130
Yeah.

1863
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:27,690
Yeah.

1864
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,430
Yeah.

1865
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,050
It looks like...

1866
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:36,510
Gerlukovich!

1867
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,170
Yeah!

1868
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:45,750
Yeah!

1869
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:53,270
I believe so.

1870
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:54,190
You could say that.

1871
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,270
I saw a surveillance remote just now.

1872
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,670
It looked like the Cypher.

1873
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,270
A Marine Cypher-T?

1874
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,210
Army.

1875
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:02,770
Army.

1876
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:03,430
First the Marines.

1877
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:04,730
Then the Russians.

1878
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:05,970
Now the Army?

1879
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:07,230
You're right.

1880
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,810
This isn't gonna be simple.

1881
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:10,210
Snake.

1882
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:12,350
There's something I have to tell you.

1883
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:12,750
Otacon?

1884
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,270
We didn't dig up this info about the new Metal Gear on our own.

1885
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:18,490
Otacon?

1886
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,450
Why are you keeping secrets from me?

1887
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:21,510
It was a tip.

1888
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:22,950
An anonymous tip.

1889
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,030
Anonymous?

1890
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:25,550
You've never trusted those.

1891
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,570
Why would you start now?

1892
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:30,350
I am?

1893
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:33,110
Step-bro?

1894
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,390
EE!

1895
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:40,510
EE!

1896
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:49,390
Why would you- Such a bad nickname.

1897
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:55,050
It's easier to say Emma than EE.

1898
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,950
When was the last time you saw her?

1899
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:58,330
Over ten years ago.

1900
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,770
You think it's a trap to lure us out here?

1901
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:01,650
I don't know.

1902
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:05,410
After I got the tip, I did break into the Pentagon system to get confirmation.

1903
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:08,030
Watch your back, Snake.

1904
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:09,810
Maybe I screwed up.

1905
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,970
I've got a light-equipped USP.

1906
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:13,330
I can take them on now.

1907
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:17,150
There's no ammo, but it takes a 9mm, just like the Marine's M9.

1908
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,130
I'll find those somewhere around here.

1909
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:21,570
Don't raise too much racket with that thing.

1910
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:22,670
I hear you.

1911
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,390
Hee hee hee hee hee.

1912
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,230
I won't kill... yet.

1913
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,570
Actually, I love having a tranquilizer.

1914
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,450
Truly, I think it makes things so much easier.

1915
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:37,970
What do you got for me?

1916
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,710
Can I get her a dog tag?

1917
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:41,330
Oh!

1918
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:42,690
Yay!

1919
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:47,310
I wish I could take this, but I'm just too good at the game.

1920
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,420
Take a picture of her?

1921
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,210
Say, tease!

1922
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:06,290
Did he just kiss the...

1923
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:15,290
This guy... his libido... his vibrato... his everything.

1924
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,320
Snake... David... Snake.

1925
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,060
Solid David Snake.

1926
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,320
What is up with... what is... what is wrong with you?

1927
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,880
I like going to the very tippy top.

1928
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,060
What a thrill.

1929
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,640
It's the wrong game, but I'm singing it anyway.

1930
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,040
What a thrill.

1931
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,280
I gotta go to the bathroom, you guys.

1932
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:55,680
Is it okay if I go to the bathroom real quick?

1933
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,960
I'm just gonna chill up here.

1934
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,260
I'll be right back.

1935
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,560
I'll be right back.

1936
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,500
You guys can have some rain ASMR.

1937
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,440
Will I go to the bathroom?

1938
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,260
Three...

1939
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,640
Four...

1940
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:51,880
Three...

1941
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,820
I'm back!

1942
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:33,620
Sorry!

1943
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,000
I got myself a little snack, too.

1944
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,060
A little... did you enjoy the ASMR?

1945
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,940
Did you enjoy that?

1946
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,280
All that ASMR goodness?

1947
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,600
Okaeri itanaima!

1948
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,020
No, I'm supposed to say okaeri to you.

1949
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,600
I'm the maid.

1950
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,180
And well...

1951
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,260
Okoroko.

1952
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,940
I always... I never learn in my lesson, you guys.

1953
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,520
I always say...

1954
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,820
Don't drink coffee.

1955
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,540
Because it makes me too...

1956
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:13,540
How do I get off of here?

1957
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,340
And it makes me too shaky.

1958
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,360
It makes me too hungry.

1959
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,480
But I'm like, I gotta stay awake for these streams.

1960
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:24,340
The rain honks you, honks you.

1961
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,400
I do it every time.

1962
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,720
Isn't there a guy over here?

1963
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,640
Or am I crazy?

1964
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:43,010
Oh my god, I can't even see the sight.

1965
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:45,950
I got it anyway.

1966
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,180
The picture of Olga looks like she's like...

1967
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,460
Because it's so pixelated, it looks like she's dead.

1968
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,440
It just looks like she's dead.

1969
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:05,080
Isn't caffeine bad for your lovely voice though?

1970
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,180
I don't know.

1971
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,180
I think... probably.

1972
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,160
But I don't drink that much coffee.

1973
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,200
I only drink it when I'm like...

1974
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,180
I didn't sleep well last night, so...

1975
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,340
She isn't?

1976
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,660
Oh, there he is.

1977
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,180
I was like, I know some guy comes out here.

1978
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:39,020
I'll kill you with this.

1979
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,840
I'm shooting too slow.

1980
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,720
I'm too slow.

1981
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,400
Getting his steps in.

1982
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:10,780
Some more bullets.

1983
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,880
All the bullets that I wasted trying to get this guy.

1984
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,680
This keeps looking like a locker to me.

1985
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,500
You're not just pretty good, you're really good!

1986
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:25,700
Snake's tiny step is when he...

1987
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,260
You guys see that?

1988
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:27,720
He's like...

1989
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,040
I messed it up.

1990
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,640
It's fine.

1991
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:33,860
Go!

1992
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:34,740
Go!

1993
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:35,680
Snake!

1994
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,000
I have a wet box.

1995
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,900
Oh, rolling down some stairs.

1996
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,580
How do I... It's X, right?

1997
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:56,740
Out of curiosity, are you able to do this or any other future MGS runs with Snake in a tux?

1998
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:00,900
Maybe.

1999
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:03,360
I would have to beat it first though, right?

2000
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,420
Calling about Olga has Otacon and Snake mentioned Meryl.

2001
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,460
This is the bridge.

2002
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,960
But it's not just a place where you steer the ship.

2003
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:23,840
In a modern tanker, navigational, engine control, communication and all other major operational functions are consolidated in the bridge.

2004
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,100
The ship is autopiloted via a global positioning satellite system.

2005
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,080
This is a precision instrument we're talking about here, so it's probably best to leave it alone.

2006
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,020
No!

2007
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:37,420
I'm gonna make a crash into a bridge.

2008
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,080
Or something.

2009
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:39,780
I don't know.

2010
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,920
The Hudson River Bridge.

2011
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:42,340
Hey, Snake.

2012
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,840
You found a handgun.

2013
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,480
It's a decent one.

2014
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:46,440
An USP.

2015
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,300
The USP fires real bullets.

2016
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,580
Not the knockout rounds the M9 uses.

2017
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,720
You know that, right?

2018
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:53,320
Yeah?

2019
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:55,460
The USP isn't equipped with a suppressor either.

2020
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,940
If you fire it when their enemy's nearby, they'll probably hear it.

2021
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,600
Keep that in mind.

2022
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,000
Having the USP will make combat easier.

2023
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:05,000
But being undetected is still the best way to go.

2024
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:05,680
Okay.

2025
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:06,220
Okay.

2026
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,980
My USP.

2027
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,760
Snake, Metal Gear is in the holds below the tanker's deck.

2028
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,640
Go down.

2029
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:15,440
Down.

2030
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:16,300
Okay.

2031
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:20,820
Wait, if I go back outside where Olga is, will he mention her?

2032
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:22,920
Just noticed the stream.

2033
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,760
Kept you waiting, huh?

2034
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:24,500
Welcome!

2035
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,340
Is it about time to tell you that Box is slaying for something?

2036
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,960
People said that before!

2037
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,020
Oh, she's up here.

2038
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,520
Oh, she's gone!

2039
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,360
Eaten by the birds.

2040
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,500
Sorry, Olga.

2041
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,580
Oh, come on.

2042
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,000
Keep going.

2043
01:43:58,780 --> 01:43:59,380
Oh well.

2044
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:00,440
It's okay.

2045
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:03,660
Nothing here.

2046
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,500
I wanna see what my box... my new box looks like.

2047
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:09,620
Wet box.

2048
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,220
Wet and weak.

2049
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:15,420
No!

2050
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,500
My wet and weak box.

2051
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:27,720
My flimsy, fragile, sad, wet box.

2052
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:29,820
Whose footprints are these?

2053
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,200
No!

2054
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,960
I'm gonna call one more time.

2055
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,660
We'll see what he says.

2056
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,720
Oh wait, he told me to go down.

2057
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,080
That's right.

2058
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,280
This is the bridge.

2059
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2060
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,490
Oh yeah, let's save.

2061
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,390
We had more people...

2062
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:05,090
Oh my god.

2063
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:09,290
More people join us, so...

2064
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:10,830
Time to save?

2065
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:11,470
Yeah!

2066
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:19,410
Wet and weak sounded like a good time.

2067
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:29,190
Another Chinese proverb.

2068
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:29,590
Let's go!

2069
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,590
Those who look to the heavens prosper.

2070
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:34,050
Those who defy it are no more.

2071
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:35,170
Do you know this one?

2072
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,090
The meaning here is...

2073
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:38,490
Snake doesn't even respond.

2074
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:43,150
That you can only survive as long as you're a part of the natural order of things.

2075
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,570
You remember pre-wrapped jeans?

2076
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:52,110
Manufacturers thought that just because people loved old, broken-in jeans, they would want to buy new jeans that looked old.

2077
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:52,770
New jeans!

2078
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,770
Gojumbo does it again!

2079
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:57,230
What does jeans have to do with nature and order?

2080
01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:00,110
Denim should fray and rip on its own.

2081
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:01,290
Naturally, right?

2082
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:04,010
Some designers tried to go against that and...

2083
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:05,590
No one bought them.

2084
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:08,970
The earnings report from that fiscal year is enough of a proof.

2085
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:10,470
Earnings?

2086
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:12,750
Earnings?

2087
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:14,370
Why does it end there?

2088
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,350
Oh my goodness.

2089
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:20,770
Did they come through here?

2090
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,410
Oh no, now he's on that side.

2091
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:23,670
Okay.

2092
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,370
But we still got our little...

2093
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:28,530
Oh,

2094
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,460
what if I usp him?

2095
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:40,560
Nah.

2096
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:41,480
I forgot.

2097
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,880
Can I shoot through the box in this one?

2098
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:46,660
No.

2099
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:48,880
I guess it's too OP.

2100
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,780
So sad.

2101
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,090
Flawed recessive jeans.

2102
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:08,890
Alright, to go downstairs...

2103
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:10,730
Just

2104
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:19,650
gonna put you over here.

2105
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:20,790
Mister.

2106
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:24,830
Right there.

2107
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:26,950
You got anything for me?

2108
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:31,050
Oh yeah, I guess I could shoot the...

2109
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,750
the thing to turn it off...

2110
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:33,470
What's it called?

2111
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,050
Will they hear me though?

2112
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:36,330
Don't remember.

2113
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,310
That part, right?

2114
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:41,610
I'm scared.

2115
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:42,510
What if he hears me?

2116
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:45,430
I'm too scared.

2117
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,230
I'm too scared.

2118
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:52,610
Alright, let's go.

2119
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,210
Oh, it's this room.

2120
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,790
Forgot about this one.

2121
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,310
Yeah!

2122
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:17,810
Fuck me!

2123
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,160
Isn't there stuff like, underneath the table?

2124
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,640
Time for a snack!

2125
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:36,420
I wish.

2126
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:38,120
What's over there anyway?

2127
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:39,820
Why is there just...

2128
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,520
Why is it in the most random spot?

2129
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,140
I guess for that door?

2130
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:47,740
Hmm.

2131
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,600
Excuse me.

2132
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,760
Snake is so considerate.

2133
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,780
Oh dang, her rations are full.

2134
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,560
Oh yeah, we can shoot it now!

2135
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,660
Hold on, I'm gonna grab this though.

2136
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:03,820
And then...

2137
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,440
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run...

2138
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,340
Don't wake up now, mister.

2139
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,300
Don't wake up now.

2140
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,460
Don't wake up now.

2141
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,320
It's so loud.

2142
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:29,230
More usps.

2143
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,290
Wait, where's this one go?

2144
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:37,830
Oh, okay.

2145
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:44,150
Calm down.

2146
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:45,230
Calm down.

2147
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:47,770
Okay.

2148
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:52,310
Oh gosh, when they do that, it scares the bonkers out of me.

2149
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,250
I just wanna hide immediately.

2150
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:56,290
And I hate that.

2151
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:01,470
I don't have the radar in here.

2152
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:03,830
Why haven't we fixed the radar, huh?

2153
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:08,090
And he's gonna come all the way back.

2154
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,050
Right?

2155
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:12,150
There he goes.

2156
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:13,970
Okay.

2157
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:18,410
Just run, Snake.

2158
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:19,510
Just run.

2159
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:24,050
Oh, that's right.

2160
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:25,050
We can't go this way.

2161
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:26,050
Oh, shoot.

2162
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,130
Wait, we can shoot.

2163
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,050
Nothing.

2164
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:40,750
Nothing here.

2165
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:44,890
Can I hide you in here?

2166
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:46,870
This will be your hidey hole.

2167
01:50:49,130 --> 01:50:49,590
Okay.

2168
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:50,630
Thank you.

2169
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,210
Bye-bye.

2170
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:56,610
Just gonna do what I did before.

2171
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:00,930
We're not gonna waste bullets.

2172
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:01,610
We don't need to.

2173
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:06,410
His neck.

2174
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,870
Don't worry about it.

2175
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:09,670
He'll just go to a chiropractor later.

2176
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:10,270
It's fine.

2177
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:12,170
Dragging his face across the metal.

2178
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:13,510
He doesn't mind.

2179
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:14,210
He doesn't mind.

2180
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:15,610
Probably.

2181
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,480
So I run up.

2182
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:28,820
And then I go.

2183
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:30,540
Do I have to... I have a question.

2184
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,820
Do I have to hold them up in first person only?

2185
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,060
Or can I do it in... like this?

2186
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,100
Here we go.

2187
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:37,580
Ah!

2188
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:38,440
I learned.

2189
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:39,220
Nevermind.

2190
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,280
Shake for me!

2191
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,720
He's got his dog tag.

2192
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,420
Shake!

2193
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,640
Don't kill me.

2194
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,040
Shake!

2195
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:50,960
Yippee!

2196
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,660
Don't kill me.

2197
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,480
Okay.

2198
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,560
You got a lucky Ronin.

2199
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,660
This goes up.

2200
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:05,300
I don't remember.

2201
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,040
This way?

2202
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,540
Now I'll aim at his crotch next time.

2203
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:18,600
Wait.

2204
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:20,340
I don't want to shoot him though.

2205
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:25,120
While the other guy is up in there too.

2206
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,720
Shake it baby.

2207
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:36,830
Cause there's the other guy in the other room.

2208
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:38,510
He'll see him collapse.

2209
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:38,990
You know?

2210
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:41,990
Like that.

2211
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,600
And then from here...

2212
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,760
I'm just gonna lay down.

2213
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:49,380
Um...

2214
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,280
Wait.

2215
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:50,680
Where is he?

2216
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,400
Wait.

2217
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:52,880
Where's your friend?

2218
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:55,500
Oh.

2219
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:57,700
Oh.

2220
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:00,840
Just kidding.

2221
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:01,940
Oh.

2222
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,260
I think I go this way, right?

2223
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,560
Cause this is um...

2224
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,240
It's down here I think?

2225
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:15,900
Right?

2226
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:20,780
Yeah?

2227
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,200
Okay.

2228
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:24,460
Give me your stuff!

2229
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,960
Crack the glass?

2230
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:28,640
Oh can you?

2231
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,780
This game is like crazy.

2232
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:33,700
There's so many different ways to be able to get around in this game.

2233
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:35,220
And just play it in general.

2234
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,240
It's just...

2235
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,760
It's actually insane.

2236
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:41,360
I thought it stopped raining.

2237
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,580
What happened?

2238
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:46,800
Oh that's right.

2239
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:46,960
Alright.

2240
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,320
Stinky guy.

2241
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:50,640
Stinky.

2242
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:54,660
Stinky!

2243
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:55,720
Stinky!

2244
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,520
Do I wanna...

2245
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,860
Do I wanna...

2246
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:00,020
Wait I can't grab a stinky rations anyway.

2247
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,620
I don't think I can grab a stinky rations.

2248
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,500
Wait how

2249
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,120
do I get in through here?

2250
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:15,000
Hmm?

2251
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:17,760
Beep beep.

2252
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:19,480
Oh

2253
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:25,880
nasty!

2254
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,740
Can I have them actually?

2255
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:30,320
No I can't even eat a rations.

2256
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:32,580
I'm on the wrong side.

2257
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,220
Oh okay.

2258
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,440
Shoot.

2259
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,160
It's fine.

2260
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:39,420
We got to see our stinky friend.

2261
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:40,900
Matara gone.

2262
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:44,160
Barely friend.

2263
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,800
More foe than friend.

2264
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:46,560
If anything.

2265
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,390
Stun grenade.

2266
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:50,910
Nice.

2267
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:52,950
Uh oh.

2268
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:55,290
Wait is this a spooky hallway?

2269
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:05,030
That silhouette!

2270
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:06,550
No.

2271
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:07,770
No!

2272
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:08,730
Oregon!

2273
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:13,210
Okay.

2274
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:16,830
I know.

2275
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:17,930
But that...

2276
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:20,030
But this...

2277
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:22,710
That silhouette!

2278
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:23,390
Raven?

2279
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,930
No.

2280
01:55:27,510 --> 01:55:28,950
There's no way.

2281
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:31,710
We saw him get eaten alive.

2282
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,130
Snake.

2283
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:33,010
That shadow.

2284
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:34,570
It's him.

2285
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:35,230
It's Moses.

2286
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:36,610
Shadow Moses.

2287
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:39,570
But Raven was, you know, out in Shadow Moses.

2288
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:40,330
I know.

2289
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:42,550
Maybe it's the last of his nine lives.

2290
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:45,390
Or maybe his maker decided to give him another chance.

2291
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,510
You're not serious are you?

2292
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:48,610
Maybe I am.

2293
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,650
Maybe I'm not.

2294
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:54,090
We literally saw him get eaten by birds.

2295
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:54,490
Snake.

2296
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:55,010
Watch your step.

2297
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,590
Okay?

2298
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:58,870
There was nothing left of him.

2299
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:12,430
Why did they never make this into an actual figure?

2300
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:21,580
I'll explain how to use the camera.

2301
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:23,940
That digital camera you have was...

2302
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,060
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2303
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,140
Raven Nindo win.

2304
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:30,900
And yes I will shoot him.

2305
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:31,380
Don't worry.

2306
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,720
Oh my gosh.

2307
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:35,740
Is this a sexy lady?

2308
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,100
Is this a...

2309
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:39,080
This is probably the sexiest lady.

2310
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,420
Even better.

2311
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,800
Take a picture of Snake.

2312
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,420
It'll last longer.

2313
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,040
Good.

2314
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,280
Snake.

2315
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:10,300
There should be a door into the holds in the northwest section of the engine room.

2316
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,340
Head west.

2317
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,380
This game is so unserious.

2318
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,140
I love it.

2319
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,480
I love this game so much.

2320
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,220
This game is so stupid.

2321
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,220
This game is so awesome.

2322
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:24,240
I love this game.

2323
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,020
I love this game.

2324
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:25,720
I love this game.

2325
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,120
Shoot his tiny little head.

2326
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:31,920
Am I actually... I can't tell if I'm aiming at it or not.

2327
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:33,840
I'm like going through it.

2328
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:54,740
Deeply unserious tactical espionage action.

2329
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:55,500
Exactly.

2330
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:55,800
Exactly.

2331
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,540
I know like I've already been two hours on the tanker.

2332
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:07,220
But the tanker is just so fun.

2333
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:07,660
You know.

2334
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:08,520
It's so fun.

2335
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,900
Look at him go.

2336
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:12,560
Look at the shadow.

2337
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:17,780
Freeze.

2338
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:20,100
No.

2339
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,060
No.

2340
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:36,080
I know everybody else is like downstairs and stuff.

2341
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:40,770
There's this guy.

2342
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:41,870
Oh yeah.

2343
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:44,470
Okay.

2344
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:44,990
Let's see.

2345
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:46,430
Who all can we get from up here?

2346
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,290
Like you?

2347
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:51,720
And I know there's a guy over here.

2348
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,860
Can we see him?

2349
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:57,620
Oh there he is.

2350
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:58,980
Dang it.

2351
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:01,880
I missed him again.

2352
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:02,440
There we go.

2353
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:02,780
There we go.

2354
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:08,270
It's my controller.

2355
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:10,170
There we go.

2356
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:11,710
My controller.

2357
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:15,470
He's trying to sabotage me.

2358
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:27,830
Where is he?

2359
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:29,990
No.

2360
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:31,110
It's the button.

2361
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:31,890
It really is.

2362
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,690
That's why I was shaking.

2363
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,900
Please forgive old...

2364
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,360
Oh shit.

2365
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:49,180
Old controller.

2366
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:50,120
Please forgive.

2367
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,620
You know.

2368
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:54,860
Old controller things.

2369
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:55,900
Can I drop from here?

2370
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,800
Will he see me?

2371
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:11,260
Oh nice.

2372
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:13,180
Can he see me from here?

2373
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:19,580
Oh shoot.

2374
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:20,460
There we go.

2375
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,480
There we go.

2376
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:23,500
Okay.

2377
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:26,860
I

2378
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:32,260
think that takes care of everybody.

2379
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:34,640
In this room.

2380
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,400
Pull ups?

2381
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:36,860
No.

2382
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,120
I tried.

2383
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,220
I'm sick of pull ups.

2384
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:41,500
I'm sick of being healthy.

2385
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,760
I'm tired of health.

2386
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,000
I'm tired of taking care of myself.

2387
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:50,980
Oh I forgot there was a guy down there.

2388
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:51,600
Oh my god.

2389
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:17,180
What's that?

2390
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:18,440
Nothing here.

2391
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:19,800
Nothing here.

2392
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,500
Nothing here.

2393
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,300
Nothing here.

2394
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:27,420
You know you'd be less tired if you were more fit.

2395
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,100
Shut up.

2396
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:35,350
Just a box.

2397
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:37,990
Will he see me now?

2398
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:38,930
Oh shit.

2399
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:42,960
I almost missed that.

2400
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,460
I almost missed that one.

2401
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:50,880
I forgot about him.

2402
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:52,720
Oh yes.

2403
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:53,400
This room too.

2404
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:54,480
Wait can I?

2405
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:55,380
What was in here?

2406
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,320
Nothing?

2407
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,580
Just a box.

2408
02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:12,730
Repair of the entrance way to the engine room on the port side is complete.

2409
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:17,190
We'll return to position following patrol at the small room on the port side.

2410
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:21,430
Sick.

2411
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,460
Did he leave?

2412
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:42,440
Is he gone?

2413
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,560
Wait I hear him.

2414
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:47,960
I think.

2415
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,360
Good poster.

2416
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:56,900
Hey.

2417
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:00,280
Stop acting up with your hyperactive libidos everybody.

2418
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:01,260
Am I good?

2419
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:02,600
I can't tell.

2420
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:07,700
Okay.

2421
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,260
Oh shoot.

2422
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,280
Wait he's outside.

2423
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:11,180
Does he come in?

2424
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,140
No.

2425
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:13,880
I don't think.

2426
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:14,420
I don't remember.

2427
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:14,980
I don't think so.

2428
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,880
And Otacon are you gonna call me?

2429
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,280
There it is.

2430
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:26,440
Snake there's another set of infrared sensors in place.

2431
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:30,900
If you touch that the explosives will detonate and that ship will be pulverized.

2432
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:31,120
Oh no.

2433
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:34,020
I'm not in the mood to go sleep with the fishes.

2434
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,720
But there are too many sensors.

2435
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,040
Looks like I'll have to find another way.

2436
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,440
No need to worry.

2437
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,640
There's a way through.

2438
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:43,820
Take a close look.

2439
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:47,380
Do you see the thing with blinking green lights right next to the explosives?

2440
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:48,020
Yes.

2441
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,200
That's the control unit for the sensors.

2442
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:51,780
Wow.

2443
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,360
Destroy that and the sensors stop functioning.

2444
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:56,020
I see.

2445
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:57,580
You can't get in close enough to touch it.

2446
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,900
So you'll have to shoot it out.

2447
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:02,920
But the M9's knockout rounds won't work.

2448
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:04,340
The USP you picked up should be the trick.

2449
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:05,460
No they're gonna hear it.

2450
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:06,200
Use that gun.

2451
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:10,520
But they're gonna hear it.

2452
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:20,370
I'm almost out of film you guys.

2453
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:22,310
2000's camera.

2454
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:24,670
Oh actually I am out of film.

2455
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:25,630
What do I do?

2456
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,020
They're gonna hear me.

2457
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:35,520
Hmm.

2458
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:37,320
Can't hear if they eep.

2459
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:38,380
True.

2460
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:44,080
Can I go through this room yet?

2461
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:44,460
Oh I can.

2462
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:47,680
Oh.

2463
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,120
Wait I forgot this.

2464
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:53,980
Delete circuit.

2465
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:55,700
Ah.

2466
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:56,740
Okay okay.

2467
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:57,460
It's a shortcut.

2468
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,620
Oh I didn't even realize.

2469
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,080
Oh.

2470
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,350
Okay okay.

2471
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:06,290
I'm gonna save this.

2472
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,230
I don't think.

2473
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:09,850
Saving in these games are always weird because.

2474
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:12,330
You really just save?

2475
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:14,790
You really only save to like.

2476
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:15,950
Cause if I die.

2477
02:05:16,870 --> 02:05:18,330
I just start back at the room.

2478
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:18,770
You know.

2479
02:05:20,090 --> 02:05:22,330
You really only save for when you're done playing the game.

2480
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:24,470
But it is also good to save.

2481
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,350
Every now and then.

2482
02:05:25,630 --> 02:05:26,890
Just in case something happens.

2483
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,150
What?

2484
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:28,310
What?

2485
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:32,590
Oh.

2486
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:35,770
Amazing how relevant these Chinese proverbs still are.

2487
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:37,170
Once the moment's gone.

2488
02:05:37,330 --> 02:05:37,930
It's gone.

2489
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:40,650
Except for daylight savings time of course.

2490
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:42,950
I wish that part was dated.

2491
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:44,610
Gotta love it.

2492
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:47,510
Then again you lose an hour every spring.

2493
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:49,630
So I guess the proverbs are right.

2494
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,950
I wish that part was dated.

2495
02:05:51,230 --> 02:05:51,970
They thought of everything.

2496
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:55,070
Did they even have daylight savings back then?

2497
02:05:55,230 --> 02:05:56,390
Of course not.

2498
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:58,150
They knew how to save time.

2499
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:00,630
We're the ones that need to be tricked into it.

2500
02:06:02,230 --> 02:06:03,990
The moment never returns Snake.

2501
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:06,070
Let's not waste it on idle questions.

2502
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:06,810
Oh my god.

2503
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:07,110
Otacon!

2504
02:06:09,410 --> 02:06:12,570
Snake doesn't even argue with the guy.

2505
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:15,050
He doesn't even argue with him man.

2506
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:18,670
Oh my god.

2507
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:19,330
Are you kidding me?

2508
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:21,050
Are you kidding me right now?

2509
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:23,450
I missed my chance Otacon.

2510
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:24,590
The Chinese proverbs!

2511
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:27,670
Otacon.

2512
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:28,270
No!

2513
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:31,550
He's going even further away.

2514
02:06:32,230 --> 02:06:32,230
Oh my god.

2515
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:32,850
I missed my chance.

2516
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:33,530
Otacon.

2517
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:35,110
Otacon missed my chance coming back.

2518
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:35,730
Otacon please.

2519
02:06:36,190 --> 02:06:37,190
He's not going to see me is he?

2520
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:37,610
Oh my god.

2521
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:37,990
I'm so scared.

2522
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:41,470
Okay.

2523
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:43,950
Sheesh.

2524
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:53,850
So I shoot the green things?

2525
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:57,390
Wait.

2526
02:06:57,930 --> 02:06:58,630
Oh the green.

2527
02:06:58,630 --> 02:06:58,850
Wait.

2528
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:01,210
Like uh...

2529
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:03,510
Can you shut that please?

2530
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:04,630
Thank you.

2531
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:09,050
This one.

2532
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:09,510
Here.

2533
02:07:09,590 --> 02:07:10,290
There we go.

2534
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:12,030
Okay.

2535
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:13,370
And...

2536
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:15,890
There's more though.

2537
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:18,630
I think I need to get up here though.

2538
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:19,470
Don't I for one part?

2539
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:24,430
There it is.

2540
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:26,010
And

2541
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:34,530
the camera.

2542
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:34,790
The camera.

2543
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:38,010
Do I zoom in again?

2544
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:41,850
Zoom with O?

2545
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,750
Okay.

2546
02:07:45,050 --> 02:07:46,150
Thermal goggles?

2547
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:48,050
No right?

2548
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,090
I need to...

2549
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,210
Actually I think... let me get down.

2550
02:07:52,290 --> 02:07:52,470
Yeah.

2551
02:07:56,270 --> 02:07:56,830
I'm zo...

2552
02:07:56,830 --> 02:08:00,290
What did I overwrite?

2553
02:08:00,570 --> 02:08:01,150
No!

2554
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,330
I overwrit the man boobs!

2555
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:03,730
No!

2556
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:07,170
No!

2557
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,750
No!

2558
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:13,170
So sad.

2559
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:19,130
Where is it?

2560
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,200
Well maybe I can go in closer.

2561
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:33,240
Green.

2562
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,820
Green, green, green.

2563
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:36,840
Green?

2564
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:40,580
And is anybody seeing green around here?

2565
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,040
Anybody?

2566
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:45,620
Anybody seeing green?

2567
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,080
Little green light?

2568
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:48,380
Am I blind?

2569
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,740
Am I blind?

2570
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:55,240
Is that it right there?

2571
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,200
You have to crouch?

2572
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:00,120
I do?

2573
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,380
Is that?

2574
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,340
Green bottom right.

2575
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:13,260
Where?

2576
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,140
No!

2577
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:15,800
Not me!

2578
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:15,940
Not me!

2579
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:20,580
Bottom left?

2580
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,040
Is that it?

2581
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,920
I wish I could scoot over a little bit more.

2582
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:26,820
What if I...

2583
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,840
Get down on the ground?

2584
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:32,480
Ah!

2585
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:34,040
Oh!

2586
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:39,520
Why did you do the thing that I told you to do?

2587
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,200
This is such a good tutorial.

2588
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,820
Really just teaches you everything.

2589
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,420
The control is the true boss fight.

2590
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,860
Here's the scary part!

2591
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:15,980
You are ordered to continue manning your post until that time.

2592
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,120
Here's the scary part!

2593
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,740
This hallway freaks me out, man.

2594
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:25,740
Ah!

2595
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:28,240
A person!

2596
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,080
Ah!

2597
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:31,440
Smelly!

2598
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:33,940
Stinky!

2599
02:10:40,710 --> 02:10:42,810
This isn't the one where I fight, right?

2600
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:45,790
Oh my god!

2601
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:46,530
Oh my god!

2602
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:47,070
Oh my god!

2603
02:10:47,070 --> 02:10:50,050
My eyes!

2604
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:01,150
Oh!

2605
02:11:01,710 --> 02:11:02,410
I lived!

2606
02:11:02,730 --> 02:11:03,250
Hahaha!

2607
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:06,410
Oh!

2608
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:07,210
My eyes!

2609
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,820
Good night, sweet prince.

2610
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:18,520
Is this the guy that's...

2611
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:19,940
Yeah.

2612
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,680
He's jamming.

2613
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:24,340
Hahaha!

2614
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:26,560
Wish I could take his toons, though.

2615
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:27,840
Tiki-tiki-tch!

2616
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:28,540
Tiki-tiki-tch!

2617
02:11:34,650 --> 02:11:36,090
I didn't mean to pick you up.

2618
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:37,910
Sure.

2619
02:11:38,130 --> 02:11:39,010
I'll carry you around.

2620
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:40,970
A shame to shoot him.

2621
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:42,390
I have to.

2622
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:43,350
I have to.

2623
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,610
Just like with this buddy.

2624
02:11:45,090 --> 02:11:46,450
Nothing to worry about.

2625
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:47,050
Hahaha!

2626
02:11:48,230 --> 02:11:48,670
Nothing.

2627
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:52,790
I think he's the only...

2628
02:11:53,410 --> 02:11:53,850
Oh!

2629
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:56,610
I think he's the only...

2630
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:58,270
Ah!

2631
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:00,190
Another guy, right?

2632
02:12:01,010 --> 02:12:01,970
Come on.

2633
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,680
Excuse me!

2634
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:18,020
He's listening to in the club.

2635
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:18,700
Hahaha!

2636
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:22,160
Go shorty.

2637
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:23,440
It's your birthday.

2638
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:26,080
We're gonna party like it's your birthday.

2639
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:28,760
Sippin' on Bacardi like it's your birthday.

2640
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:29,680
Sippin' on Bacardi like it's your birthday.

2641
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:32,360
We don't get enough that it's not your birthday.

2642
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:33,220
We don't get enough that it's not your birthday.

2643
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:34,460
This is where I fight.

2644
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:35,760
I don't wanna fight.

2645
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:38,620
I'm a pacifist now.

2646
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:41,840
I'm a pacifist now.

2647
02:12:43,780 --> 02:12:44,300
Okay.

2648
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,660
Everybody, shield your eyes.

2649
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:46,320
Ahhh!

2650
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:52,970
Oh, gosh.

2651
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:53,630
My eyes.

2652
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:05,960
My eyes!

2653
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,280
When do we fight?

2654
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,480
I know it's scripted.

2655
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:10,300
Oh!

2656
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:10,840
There!

2657
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:12,080
That's where we fight!

2658
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:13,560
I remember these boxes!

2659
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:16,600
I'll never not remember these boxes.

2660
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,700
I'm gonna have to just uspit.

2661
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,540
I'm gonna uspit everybody.

2662
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:20,680
I think.

2663
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:23,240
Save.

2664
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:23,580
Oh!

2665
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:24,160
I forgot.

2666
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:24,800
It's okay.

2667
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:27,540
Like I said, if you die, you just start back up in the same room.

2668
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:31,280
No biggie.

2669
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,100
I'll just click continue.

2670
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:35,900
Do you guys prefer...

2671
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:39,820
Like, you know how there's the new Figma coming out of...

2672
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,180
Snake?

2673
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:45,260
Do you prefer his uniform a little more blue or a little more grey?

2674
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,180
Cause in this lighting it's really grey.

2675
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:48,660
But outside it's really blue.

2676
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:51,280
I like it bluer, I think.

2677
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:51,900
But...

2678
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:53,980
Oh, my God.

2679
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:54,720
There's so many guys!

2680
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:59,260
Grey, blue...

2681
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,520
The chat is split.

2682
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:05,100
The chat's all over again.

2683
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,000
I see the sternache.

2684
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:07,540
Alright.

2685
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:10,160
The lift is also under our control.

2686
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,020
We're on the floor deck.

2687
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,600
About to ascend to the hold...

2688
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:17,120
Sir, the marine commander has started his speech already.

2689
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,820
We will complete the preparations before the end of the speech.

2690
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:23,560
All communications to the hold have been severed.

2691
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:25,200
No one is aware of our presence.

2692
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:25,880
I'm aware.

2693
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,820
Let no one turn into the hold...

2694
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:29,740
Oh, gosh.

2695
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:31,240
Are they gonna see me if I run out?

2696
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:33,200
I'm too scared!

2697
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:35,580
There is one more thing.

2698
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:37,520
Yes, sir.

2699
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:37,960
Columbo?

2700
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,220
Yes, sir.

2701
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:44,480
Yes, sir.

2702
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:45,240
Oh, God.

2703
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:51,370
I'm too scared!

2704
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:54,270
Okay.

2705
02:14:54,710 --> 02:14:57,110
I'm gonna put on the thermal goggles, warning you guys.

2706
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:59,070
Warning you now.

2707
02:14:59,330 --> 02:14:59,810
Oh, my God.

2708
02:14:59,830 --> 02:14:59,990
Snake.

2709
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:02,010
Actually, I know what I'm gonna do.

2710
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:02,950
Who goes there?

2711
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:06,230
I have a question.

2712
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:07,410
Um...

2713
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:12,050
Is this one of those...

2714
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:13,810
I have to defeat so many guys?

2715
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,870
Or is this I just run past?

2716
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:16,710
I can't remember.

2717
02:16:03,860 --> 02:16:04,860
Oh, me too.

2718
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:21,520
Oh, gosh.

2719
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:23,660
Oh, I

2720
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:44,070
should also probably have my rash on just in case.

2721
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:50,030
Oh, my God.

2722
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:50,590
Aim doko.

2723
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,390
Aim doko.

2724
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:54,090
Oh, my God.

2725
02:16:54,130 --> 02:16:54,530
Oh,

2726
02:16:58,720 --> 02:16:58,860
my God.

2727
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,700
No snake, please.

2728
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:05,960
No snake.

2729
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:12,160
Oh, my God.

2730
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:12,420
Oh, my God.

2731
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:13,420
Oh, my God.

2732
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:18,500
Okay, I have to really hold down the button.

2733
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,280
Okay.

2734
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:20,720
I gotta...

2735
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:23,820
I gotta really hold down the...

2736
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:26,080
I gotta really hold down the...

2737
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:26,440
the R2.

2738
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,140
There is one more guy, isn't there?

2739
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:30,380
Oh, there he is.

2740
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:31,720
There is two more?

2741
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:34,020
Three more!

2742
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:36,920
Oh, I think I got him.

2743
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:40,300
We're good.

2744
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:43,540
The pressure controls can be wonky.

2745
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:48,160
Yeah, I really am having to hold it down or else I'm wobbling all over the place.

2746
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:49,640
Nice!

2747
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,000
I only got hit once.

2748
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:51,400
Yay!

2749
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:54,300
RIP non-lethal run.

2750
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:54,900
It's okay.

2751
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,120
We weren't aiming for that anyway.

2752
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:58,700
I enjoy all the killing.

2753
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:00,800
I'm just like what Liquid said.

2754
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:02,560
That's just me.

2755
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,280
Okay, nobody knows I'm here.

2756
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,180
Wait, whose shadow was that behind me?

2757
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:11,740
They know I'm here.

2758
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,520
They know I'm here.

2759
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,480
They're just letting me on in.

2760
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:16,000
Oh my god, he's locking me in!

2761
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,900
Why did you try attacking me anyway?

2762
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:24,460
I know those boots anywhere.

2763
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:26,540
They were made for walking.

2764
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:28,740
And those hands were made for spinning.

2765
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:31,240
Shalashaska!

2766
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,000
Shalashaska!

2767
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:34,600
Why are you here?

2768
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,220
We thought you were with the Colonel.

2769
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:40,940
That's your own man!

2770
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,680
That's your own man!

2771
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:46,960
Why would you do that?

2772
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:49,340
Don't tell me you're double-crossing.

2773
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:57,220
Yeah, using his one hand.

2774
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:01,300
I remember cutting off the other one.

2775
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:04,260
The Colonel will be joining you soon.

2776
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:05,740
Comrade.

2777
02:19:06,980 --> 02:19:09,080
Oh my gosh, I love Cherino.

2778
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:11,840
Farming XP.

2779
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:13,780
Comrade.

2780
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:19,000
Snake, are you in yet?

2781
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:20,220
Have you made it to the hold?

2782
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:21,560
How do I get the libido?

2783
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:24,420
We've already passed the Verrazano bridge.

2784
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:27,000
How would I get the libido codec?

2785
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:27,380
I'm so sad.

2786
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,560
What?

2787
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:31,660
It's all sealed.

2788
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:33,120
What are they planning?

2789
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:36,760
If they get Metal Gear, we're going right off the fringe.

2790
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:42,580
I love this part.

2791
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:43,160
It's so funny.

2792
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:46,700
Are you accusing my man Ocelot of double-crossing?

2793
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:47,020
No.

2794
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,000
Never.

2795
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,200
They have no way of knowing that the ship's been taken over.

2796
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,100
I'm not interested in fighting these guys.

2797
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:55,500
The weapons won't do me much good here.

2798
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:57,120
Can you see Metal Gear?

2799
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:58,940
No.

2800
02:19:59,100 --> 02:19:59,700
Not yet.

2801
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:03,200
Hide in a locker?

2802
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:03,700
I tried.

2803
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:05,620
But he never said it.

2804
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:09,720
He always just said, What are you doing?

2805
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:11,020
Snake, you don't have time for this.

2806
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:12,160
Hmm.

2807
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:17,240
Okay, Snake.

2808
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,040
Let's go over this one more time.

2809
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:19,360
Okay.

2810
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,400
Use this camera to get photographic evidence of the Metal Gear prototype.

2811
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:25,380
Lock her in mine.

2812
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:28,540
Now do your thing and take pictures that speak louder than the government's plausible denials.

2813
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:29,420
Good.

2814
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,280
We need four shots.

2815
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,260
Metal Gear from the front.

2816
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,560
Front right and front left.

2817
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:37,000
And a close-up of the Marine Corps marking.

2818
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:37,880
Marking?

2819
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:38,520
Marking.

2820
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:43,180
There should be a Marine's insignia on the body of Metal Gear.

2821
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:43,920
Yes.

2822
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:48,300
Just let someone try explaining away a clear shot of that.

2823
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:49,060
Right.

2824
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:50,260
Oh, I see it.

2825
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:51,240
On his little leggy.

2826
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:52,300
All right.

2827
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:55,060
There's actually one little thing.

2828
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,440
Just spit it out.

2829
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,320
I'm used to things going wrong.

2830
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:01,040
It looks like someone's monitoring our transmission.

2831
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:02,180
Photo shot.

2832
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:03,700
I don't have a clue.

2833
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:05,320
All they're doing is watching.

2834
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:08,880
It would creep me out to listen and try to interfere with our communications.

2835
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:12,100
Could it have something to do with that cipher we saw?

2836
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:12,500
Yeah.

2837
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:12,940
Maybe.

2838
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:16,820
I've switched the encryption protocol for our burst transmission for now.

2839
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:21,020
What I want to do is use a different method for sending these photos, just in case.

2840
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:21,360
Okay.

2841
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:22,760
Instead of using the codec?

2842
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:25,620
Exactly.

2843
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:29,900
There's a workstation in the southeast corner of the block where Metal Gear is housed.

2844
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:30,440
We're hacking.

2845
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:34,340
I've made arrangements so that you can send the pictures from the machine.

2846
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:34,640
What?

2847
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:36,920
Arrangements.

2848
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,020
I hitched a ride on Link 16 at a U.S.

2849
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,500
military's proprietary network.

2850
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:48,020
Managed to get into that workstation and overwrote a part of the system software so I could remote install the little app I wrote.

2851
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:48,780
Shut up, nerd.

2852
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:48,980
Shut up, nerd.

2853
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:50,480
Why bother with anything that complicated?

2854
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:52,540
No, it's pretty simple, really.

2855
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:52,900
Who cares?

2856
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,360
You just have to go to the machine and push the action button.

2857
02:21:57,460 --> 02:21:57,740
Okay.

2858
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:01,640
The app will automatically launch and download the image data from the camera.

2859
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:03,360
Split the files and encrypt them individually.

2860
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:04,340
Why is Snake so much faster?

2861
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:07,600
The data packets can then masquerade as...

2862
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:08,520
Okay, okay.

2863
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:13,500
So all I have to do is push the action button in front of the computer once I have the pictures, right?

2864
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,580
Yep.

2865
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:16,120
Well, sure, if you put it that way.

2866
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,180
And one more thing.

2867
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:20,620
The Commandant's already begun his speech.

2868
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:23,460
But you need to get the pictures before he's done talking.

2869
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:24,120
Oh, gosh.

2870
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:26,680
The time limit.

2871
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:27,180
How much time do I have?

2872
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:30,980
I hacked into his personal files and took a look at the text of that speech.

2873
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:31,660
What?

2874
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:33,200
I'd say you have seven more minutes.

2875
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,540
I wonder if he throws in a joke or two.

2876
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,580
A seven-minute time limit, huh?

2877
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:41,020
Remember, Snake, just the photos, okay?

2878
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:44,640
With these kinds of odds, I won't be making any sudden moves.

2879
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:45,180
What?

2880
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:48,120
But that doesn't mean we can just let Metal Gear be hijacked.

2881
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:48,640
Yeah.

2882
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:50,620
Okay, but first the photos.

2883
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:53,580
All right, we'll deal with the rest when we get there.

2884
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:54,100
Right.

2885
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:54,680
Stay low.

2886
02:22:55,620 --> 02:22:55,860
Okay.

2887
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,780
I forgot about the time limit, I'll be honest.

2888
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:03,840
I like this part a lot, though.

2889
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:04,080
It's so fun.

2890
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:08,040
The initiated development of Metal Gear Ray as a countermeasure to these pirated weapons forces.

2891
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:12,580
The only thing that can stand up to a Metal Gear is, of course, another Metal Gear.

2892
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:14,500
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2893
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:16,220
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2894
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:21,080
With Ray, the hundreds if not thousands of Metal Gears La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2895
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:23,000
that exist in the world are a threat.

2896
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,640
La la la!

2897
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,380
La la la la la!

2898
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,100
I'm trying to remember how to do this part.

2899
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:51,860
Can I take that guy out?

2900
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,140
Oh!

2901
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,780
They don't notice, right?

2902
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:57,240
Oh!

2903
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:57,700
Hello?

2904
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:03,720
He's... he's so cool!

2905
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,280
How does he do it?

2906
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:08,940
What do I... what happens if I... wait.

2907
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:15,800
How do I mess with this again?

2908
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:19,520
He's so awesome.

2909
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:25,200
He makes shadow puppets.

2910
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:32,780
I wonder if I can get that guy too.

2911
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:34,960
Emmanuel!

2912
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,440
Thank you so much for the 20!

2913
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:46,830
This guy is not nearly as cool.

2914
02:24:47,770 --> 02:24:48,310
Alright.

2915
02:24:49,450 --> 02:24:50,870
That guy kinda sucks.

2916
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:52,870
Nobody noticed me.

2917
02:24:53,950 --> 02:24:56,030
How do I make the naked ladies go on the screen?

2918
02:25:02,430 --> 02:25:02,830
Ray!

2919
02:25:11,010 --> 02:25:11,410
Um...

2920
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:14,490
We'll go through this way.

2921
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:15,470
Oh, the next room.

2922
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,830
Okay.

2923
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:17,490
...interference from a major player.

2924
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:20,930
But this project is vital to the Marine Corps.

2925
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:24,430
The enemy is sometimes closer to home than you think, gentlemen.

2926
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:25,230
There we go.

2927
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:25,910
No, no, no.

2928
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:26,610
Snake, please.

2929
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,110
Lay down.

2930
02:25:27,570 --> 02:25:28,890
Oh, I guess we're going backwards.

2931
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:31,450
Okay, there we go.

2932
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:35,710
Wow, this looks so familiar, doesn't it?

2933
02:25:36,810 --> 02:25:38,730
Experience the horror of nuclear war.

2934
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:40,930
I feel like you don't really go through vents in this game.

2935
02:25:41,310 --> 02:25:42,350
Except in this part.

2936
02:25:42,710 --> 02:25:43,930
I have a daughter.

2937
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:45,990
As a soldier, I know that,

2938
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:54,680
unlike the Army's wrecks, it can prove deep underwater.

2939
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:58,620
Move in undetected and make its landing on any shoreline.

2940
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:04,960
Okay.

2941
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:07,800
Its on-board joint-punch for information airing

2942
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:11,320
accuracy.

2943
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:14,160
And takes them out with massive firepower.

2944
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:16,320
It is the ultimate weapon.

2945
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:18,160
And it is yours to guard.

2946
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:20,860
I'd like you all to think about what that means.

2947
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:21,620
Okay.

2948
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:23,600
We made it.

2949
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:26,860
The National Missile Defense Program was initiated in...

2950
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,560
Nice.

2951
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:28,380
We made it.

2952
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:29,780
I only have four minutes left.

2953
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:31,260
Ha ha ha ha!

2954
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:36,260
The National Missile Defense Program was initiated in the end of the 20th century.

2955
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,820
Projected to completion in 2005.

2956
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:43,980
However, the NMP program conducted in the year 2000 was a complete failure.

2957
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:44,620
Oh!

2958
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:48,540
And the success of the 1999 trials is now considered a false happening.

2959
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:49,020
Bwah!

2960
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:51,500
Ladies.

2961
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:52,780
Ladies.

2962
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:56,000
There was no technological solution in sight, and the program was already attacking...

2963
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:56,700
Ladies.

2964
02:26:56,820 --> 02:26:57,480
Ladies.

2965
02:26:58,420 --> 02:26:59,080
Ladies.

2966
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:02,980
Ladies.

2967
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:03,420
Ladies.

2968
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:05,740
Ha ha ha ha!

2969
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:06,460
Beep!

2970
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,240
Ha ha ha ha!

2971
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:09,180
Ladies.

2972
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:09,700
Ladies.

2973
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:12,640
In the light of a military dominance spelled out by rain.

2974
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:13,740
Most boring movie ever.

2975
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:15,600
Oh!

2976
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:16,540
Bwah!

2977
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:19,180
The shifting of the balance of power will mean a new world order.

2978
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:20,140
Ha ha ha ha!

2979
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:23,520
The Navy and Marine Corps will play a central role in its military affairs.

2980
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:25,380
Ooh la la!

2981
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:28,960
I love gravure!

2982
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:31,180
The current power will be reduced by the completion of...

2983
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:31,660
Bwah!

2984
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:32,420
Snake!

2985
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:33,980
Snake!

2986
02:27:34,460 --> 02:27:35,440
Ha ha ha!

2987
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:38,020
Snake just can't help himself.

2988
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:42,360
Snake!

2989
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:44,900
Snake!

2990
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:49,460
I can't even move.

2991
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:51,840
Paying attention to what matters.

2992
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:53,040
I'm saving them!

2993
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:54,920
Bwah!

2994
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:57,260
Yeah!

2995
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:00,360
Which... which do... which do we look at?

2996
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:01,780
Oh!

2997
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:03,860
Aw...

2998
02:28:03,860 --> 02:28:04,940
Bwah!

2999
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:06,380
Ha ha ha ha!

3000
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:07,580
What's going on?

3001
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:08,300
Snake!

3002
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,360
Snake!

3003
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:10,540
Ha ha ha ha!

3004
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:12,820
Ha ha ha ha!

3005
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:18,220
Change it back!

3006
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:21,600
Ugh...

3007
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,840
Anyway, that was a good time.

3008
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:26,280
Um...

3009
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:28,900
Oh...

3010
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:32,280
Let me go through here.

3011
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:34,420
Oh my gosh, they scared me.

3012
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:38,100
The success of the 1999 trials is now considered a chance happening.

3013
02:28:40,860 --> 02:28:41,820
I think I might just want to run.

3014
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:44,000
There was no technological solution in sight and the...

3015
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:44,320
Ah!

3016
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:45,680
Oh my gosh!

3017
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:47,900
I forgot that they could hear me!

3018
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:48,940
Ha ha ha ha!

3019
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,060
Oh my gosh, they scared me so much!

3020
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:52,340
I forgot...

3021
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:56,060
I even saw the... the... the metal on the ground.

3022
02:28:56,220 --> 02:28:57,220
I was just like...

3023
02:28:57,700 --> 02:28:58,140
Hmm...

3024
02:28:58,140 --> 02:29:00,100
I forgot that this is a cutscene.

3025
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,100
Ha ha ha!

3026
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:04,780
My bad!

3027
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:05,360
Snake!

3028
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:06,080
Respond!

3029
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:06,740
Snake!

3030
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:07,180
Snake!

3031
02:29:07,540 --> 02:29:07,980
Snake!

3032
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:08,700
Snake!

3033
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:13,680
I've been playing this game for 20 years and I had no idea you could do that with a projector.

3034
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:18,140
I feel like every time I play this game, someone is always just like, Wait, you can do that?

3035
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:19,620
Wait, you can do that?

3036
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:20,980
Every time.

3037
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:22,700
Snake!

3038
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:26,940
The National Missile Defense Program was initiated in the end of the 20th century.

3039
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,380
Projected to completion in 2005.

3040
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:32,720
However, the NMV trial conducted in the...

3041
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:32,840
Move!

3042
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:34,680
The year 2000 was a complete failure.

3043
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:39,240
The success of the 1999 trials has now preceded a chance happening.

3044
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:39,760
Oh my god!

3045
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,000
Hey, get back in position!

3046
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:43,940
Get back in position, soldier!

3047
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,680
What are you doing?

3048
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:52,140
We have intelligence that there are anti-Metal Gear terrorists planning to target the ship.

3049
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:52,580
Did they go back?

3050
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:57,500
Intruder to the left!

3051
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,160
Oh my god, I hate when they do this.

3052
02:29:59,400 --> 02:29:59,800
Ha ha ha!

3053
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:00,720
Intruder to the right!

3054
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:03,020
Intruder to the right!

3055
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:03,840
Ha ha ha!

3056
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:06,120
Oh my god.

3057
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,600
Intruder to the left!

3058
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:08,140
Yah!

3059
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:13,600
At ease, okay.

3060
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,900
Should that actually happen, I expect you to be prepared.

3061
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:20,800
We cannot and will not give up Ray.

3062
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,140
Stay on your guard at all times.

3063
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:27,200
I'm on my guard.

3064
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:30,120
Okay.

3065
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:31,300
Push!

3066
02:30:31,300 --> 02:30:31,840
Move on!

3067
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:32,200
Move on!

3068
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:32,280
Move on!

3069
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:32,460
Move on!

3070
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:32,660
Move on!

3071
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:33,720
Okay.

3072
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:36,460
There was no technological solution in sight and the...

3073
02:30:36,460 --> 02:30:37,860
Ha ha ha!

3074
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:41,980
Intruder to the left!

3075
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,020
Intruder to the right!

3076
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:45,780
Here it is.

3077
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,880
You're all familiar with the Shadow Moses incident during the Caesar administration.

3078
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,800
Snake looks so good.

3079
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:54,860
The current state of the Imperial Reformation is a direct result of that event.

3080
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:01,520
Metal Gear...

3081
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:06,910
Intruder to the left!

3082
02:31:08,410 --> 02:31:08,930
Wow!

3083
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:13,870
Grab your reload.

3084
02:31:14,110 --> 02:31:14,570
Metal Gear!

3085
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:15,470
Metal Gear!

3086
02:31:18,450 --> 02:31:20,050
Ray is so pretty.

3087
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:21,570
He he he he he he he!

3088
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:25,130
Hmm...

3089
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:26,090
Zom!

3090
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:27,170
Ha ha ha!

3091
02:31:27,470 --> 02:31:32,210
There was no technological solution in sight and the program was already attracting strong...

3092
02:31:32,970 --> 02:31:33,650
Hold on.

3093
02:31:33,830 --> 02:31:36,250
I gotta send my sexy ladies to Otacon for some...

3094
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:39,290
I can't believe I rode over the man boob.

3095
02:31:39,470 --> 02:31:40,250
So sad.

3096
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:43,810
Ha ha ha!

3097
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:44,670
Beep beep beep bop.

3098
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:48,110
Beep beep beep beep bop.

3099
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:50,050
Beep beep beep beep beep bop.

3100
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,430
Beep beep beep beep beep beep...

3101
02:31:52,430 --> 02:31:53,210
Beep beep beep beep beep.

3102
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:53,590
Beep beep...

3103
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:53,930
Colonel.

3104
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:56,310
Bop bop.

3105
02:31:56,470 --> 02:31:56,870
Incorrect.

3106
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:57,130
Scot.

3107
02:31:58,610 --> 02:31:59,010
Incorrect.

3108
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:06,650
This is on me.

3109
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:25,330
It's so cool.

3110
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:28,550
Photo viewer!

3111
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:30,750
There he is!

3112
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:33,750
Yes!

3113
02:32:34,810 --> 02:32:35,490
Is?

3114
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:46,870
Sorry, but you're gonna have to go back and shoot another set.

3115
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:49,350
I'll just make a backup of this one.

3116
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:54,010
Otacon, you dog!

3117
02:32:55,150 --> 02:32:56,870
Okay, what am I seeing now?

3118
02:32:58,770 --> 02:32:59,870
More of these?

3119
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:01,690
Is that all you think about?

3120
02:33:01,930 --> 02:33:03,790
Hey, what you like is your business.

3121
02:33:03,930 --> 02:33:05,610
Just get those Metal Gear pictures.

3122
02:33:06,410 --> 02:33:08,310
I'll just make a backup of this one.

3123
02:33:08,410 --> 02:33:08,770
Otacon!

3124
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:12,490
The next ones...

3125
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:16,430
Isn't this that soldier on the deck?

3126
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:16,970
Olga?

3127
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:17,470
Yes.

3128
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:18,970
I can't believe you took a picture of her.

3129
02:33:19,210 --> 02:33:20,170
All things considered.

3130
02:33:20,470 --> 02:33:20,750
Why not?

3131
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:22,950
What's next?

3132
02:33:23,330 --> 02:33:24,710
You're not gonna make a backup of that one, though?

3133
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:25,350
Oh!

3134
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:25,910
I'm sorry.

3135
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:27,470
You need to take another one.

3136
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:27,670
No!

3137
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:29,830
The next image is...

3138
02:33:29,830 --> 02:33:31,510
He doesn't like... he doesn't like...

3139
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:32,190
Oh!

3140
02:33:32,350 --> 02:33:34,170
I don't think we can use this.

3141
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:35,930
Oh, my bad picture.

3142
02:33:36,110 --> 02:33:37,910
The last one is...

3143
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:38,750
Is it a sexy picture?

3144
02:33:38,930 --> 02:33:42,930
I didn't think Gurlukovich was involved, of all people.

3145
02:33:43,150 --> 02:33:43,170
It's Gurlukovich.

3146
02:33:45,450 --> 02:33:47,010
We need four images.

3147
02:33:47,170 --> 02:33:47,390
Okay.

3148
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:48,610
One from the front right...

3149
02:33:48,610 --> 02:33:49,110
Front right...

3150
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:49,810
Front...

3151
02:33:49,810 --> 02:33:50,730
Front left...

3152
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:51,790
And then the Marines.

3153
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:54,470
Front... front right... front left.

3154
02:33:54,530 --> 02:33:55,710
Get the prototype on camera.

3155
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:56,110
Okay.

3156
02:33:58,490 --> 02:33:59,010
Disconnect.

3157
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:01,850
Okay.

3158
02:34:01,850 --> 02:34:02,370
Um...

3159
02:34:04,470 --> 02:34:05,730
Can I take this guy out?

3160
02:34:06,770 --> 02:34:07,290
Oh.

3161
02:34:07,870 --> 02:34:08,390
Hello?

3162
02:34:09,470 --> 02:34:09,610
Oh, okay.

3163
02:34:11,570 --> 02:34:12,090
Um...

3164
02:34:13,890 --> 02:34:14,450
So...

3165
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:18,310
Does this count?

3166
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:23,750
Yeah.

3167
02:34:24,450 --> 02:34:25,010
Good.

3168
02:34:31,450 --> 02:34:32,010
Ah!

3169
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:38,530
Oh, my God.

3170
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:39,710
He scared me so bad.

3171
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:46,050
I just thought I would sneak behind him, you know.

3172
02:34:47,390 --> 02:34:48,770
Okay, I get it.

3173
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:50,350
I don't need all the dramatics.

3174
02:34:50,370 --> 02:34:52,290
I don't need all the dramatics.

3175
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:56,330
Oh, Snake, the walk of shame.

3176
02:34:59,830 --> 02:35:01,870
Bro, walk up so fast.

3177
02:35:02,430 --> 02:35:03,050
I know, right?

3178
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:06,570
It's okay.

3179
02:35:07,090 --> 02:35:08,670
I'll get him.

3180
02:35:11,970 --> 02:35:13,250
Do I have to do this part again?

3181
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:18,430
I think so, yeah.

3182
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:19,810
I'm just gonna skip through it.

3183
02:35:23,310 --> 02:35:25,470
Well, if I could.

3184
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,750
I don't know if I...

3185
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:30,070
Okay, first up... Oh!

3186
02:35:30,210 --> 02:35:30,670
Oh!

3187
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:32,410
I kept that.

3188
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:33,910
Neat!

3189
02:35:36,650 --> 02:35:37,130
Okay.

3190
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:44,290
Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me.

3191
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:53,650
Don't look this way.

3192
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:56,290
Okay.

3193
02:35:58,210 --> 02:35:59,770
That guy is on another floor.

3194
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:01,990
Okay.

3195
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:03,390
How do I get over?

3196
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:05,250
I don't remember how to get over there, to be honest.

3197
02:36:06,730 --> 02:36:08,650
Um, can I go behind?

3198
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:10,370
Just take this guy out, too.

3199
02:36:14,370 --> 02:36:15,490
Uh, peace.

3200
02:36:24,770 --> 02:36:25,330
Uh...

3201
02:36:26,830 --> 02:36:27,110
Uh...

3202
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:31,190
Marines?

3203
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:35,070
Is it on the other side?

3204
02:36:35,890 --> 02:36:38,490
You're not so proud that you put it all over the place?

3205
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:38,930
Okay.

3206
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:39,150
Okay.

3207
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:40,210
That's fine.

3208
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:41,030
I guess.

3209
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:44,290
Further back?

3210
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:46,490
Yep.

3211
02:36:48,650 --> 02:36:49,250
Marines!

3212
02:36:51,910 --> 02:36:53,110
Let's go!

3213
02:36:54,310 --> 02:36:54,910
Good.

3214
02:36:58,690 --> 02:37:00,350
When do they move?

3215
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:00,990
I can't remember.

3216
02:37:02,750 --> 02:37:04,330
What if I take them out?

3217
02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:05,830
That would be so funny.

3218
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:10,490
I don't know.

3219
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:10,510
I don't know.

3220
02:37:10,770 --> 02:37:11,870
I don't know.

3221
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:19,450
I don't know.

3222
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:22,450
Scary.

3223
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:26,570
Scary.

3224
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:39,590
Oh my God.

3225
02:37:39,930 --> 02:37:40,690
Oh my God.

3226
02:37:40,690 --> 02:37:41,350
George Sears?

3227
02:37:47,430 --> 02:37:49,370
I'm trying to like...

3228
02:37:49,810 --> 02:37:50,030
Okay.

3229
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:52,870
I don't think they can see me.

3230
02:37:52,990 --> 02:37:53,690
Oh my God.

3231
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:54,510
Where am I?

3232
02:37:54,670 --> 02:37:55,330
Oh my God.

3233
02:37:58,130 --> 02:37:59,010
This guy.

3234
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:06,930
Oh my God.

3235
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:08,630
George Sears.

3236
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:09,110
Okay.

3237
02:38:12,210 --> 02:38:13,850
I guess I need to go...

3238
02:38:14,570 --> 02:38:15,010
here.

3239
02:38:16,650 --> 02:38:17,770
What counts as...

3240
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:21,350
What counts as front...

3241
02:38:22,210 --> 02:38:22,850
Oh my gosh.

3242
02:38:22,850 --> 02:38:23,690
I don't have much time left.

3243
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,430
Is he going to start talking about his daughter?

3244
02:38:28,830 --> 02:38:29,270
Yippee!

3245
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:30,690
Okay.

3246
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:31,030
Okay.

3247
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:32,070
I seem to be repeating myself.

3248
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:34,110
Chalk it up to old age.

3249
02:38:36,510 --> 02:38:38,570
Front, left and front.

3250
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:38,990
Okay.

3251
02:38:39,610 --> 02:38:41,410
I think maybe...

3252
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:43,950
Should I be a wetbox or a box?

3253
02:38:45,890 --> 02:38:48,150
This metal gear Rey is a prototype.

3254
02:38:48,690 --> 02:38:51,090
Designed to be operated by an onboard pilot.

3255
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:52,310
Nobody will see me right here.

3256
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:52,950
His final form...

3257
02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:55,050
Rey will be unmanned.

3258
02:38:55,290 --> 02:38:56,070
Rey will be unmanned.

3259
02:38:56,810 --> 02:38:58,690
Driven by tele-existence...

3260
02:38:58,690 --> 02:39:00,670
Driven by tele-existence...

3261
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:00,850
What is that?

3262
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:03,490
The Marines label?

3263
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:04,230
Oh, I already got it.

3264
02:39:14,050 --> 02:39:15,150
You must be tense!

3265
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:21,710
Yeah, just a little.

3266
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:25,950
Just in time, baby.

3267
02:39:37,770 --> 02:39:39,130
Only one alert?

3268
02:39:40,510 --> 02:39:41,210
One on purpose.

3269
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:43,950
Okay!

3270
02:39:46,210 --> 02:39:46,910
Is...

3271
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:49,330
Bing bing!

3272
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:50,030
Nice!

3273
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:53,770
Wait...

3274
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:57,370
Wait, I didn't overlap any of them.

3275
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:57,910
Oh, wait.

3276
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:01,150
Wait...

3277
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:07,690
Yippee!

3278
02:40:10,770 --> 02:40:11,210
Yeah!

3279
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:17,550
I'm on my way.

3280
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,310
You're not gonna show them the pretty ladies?

3281
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:20,950
I already did.

3282
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:22,890
He made backups of them, even.

3283
02:40:27,050 --> 02:40:28,890
Snake, what are you doing just standing there?

3284
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:29,790
That is all.

3285
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:31,070
Dismissed.

3286
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:32,610
Oh gosh, they're gonna notice me.

3287
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:34,830
Slow clap.

3288
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:34,890
Slow clap.

3289
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:44,830
Salute!

3290
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:00,650
Who's making that racket?

3291
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:03,890
Excellent speech, my friend.

3292
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:07,030
Who the hell...

3293
02:41:07,030 --> 02:41:09,410
Gift of the Silver Tongue.

3294
02:41:09,530 --> 02:41:11,930
They say it's the mark of a good officer.

3295
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:12,770
How is he clapping?

3296
02:41:13,250 --> 02:41:14,470
End of a liar.

3297
02:41:15,470 --> 02:41:19,490
Americans are too in love with the sound of their own voice to speak the truth.

3298
02:41:19,550 --> 02:41:20,770
He has only one hand!

3299
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:21,050
Identify yourself.

3300
02:41:21,430 --> 02:41:22,510
I'm Shaloshaska.

3301
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:28,710
I am Shaloshaska.

3302
02:41:29,890 --> 02:41:30,850
Also called...

3303
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:32,070
Revolver.

3304
02:41:33,810 --> 02:41:34,290
Ocelots.

3305
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:34,830
Yeah!

3306
02:41:37,970 --> 02:41:38,850
That guy!

3307
02:41:39,050 --> 02:41:39,530
That guy!

3308
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:40,050
That guy!

3309
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:40,790
I love that guy!

3310
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:41,630
I know that guy!

3311
02:41:41,630 --> 02:41:43,230
I love him!

3312
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:51,290
So quiet.

3313
02:41:51,490 --> 02:41:51,990
So tense.

3314
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:52,830
What do you want?

3315
02:41:54,610 --> 02:41:57,130
This machine will be quite useful.

3316
02:41:58,090 --> 02:41:59,410
What are you planning to do?

3317
02:41:59,470 --> 02:41:59,670
Steal this thing?

3318
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:01,150
I love this man like you wouldn't believe.

3319
02:42:01,510 --> 02:42:01,530
Steal?

3320
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:02,790
No.

3321
02:42:02,910 --> 02:42:04,330
I'm taking it back.

3322
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:07,730
Dead mom.

3323
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:18,680
Snake.

3324
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:19,900
Snake, keep listening.

3325
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:23,660
Oh.

3326
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:25,140
He's just standing there.

3327
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:25,460
Oh!

3328
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:27,200
Oh my god!

3329
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:28,660
Oh my god!

3330
02:42:28,860 --> 02:42:29,420
Oh my god!

3331
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:30,720
Oh my god.

3332
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:31,320
Oh my god.

3333
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:34,420
Blow his head off!

3334
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:36,080
Grilukavitch.

3335
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:38,220
That sneaky guy.

3336
02:42:39,340 --> 02:42:40,060
Nobody move.

3337
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:41,440
Understood.

3338
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:48,960
Oh my god.

3339
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:49,680
They're still filming.

3340
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:51,440
What's going on?

3341
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:51,580
Um.

3342
02:42:51,960 --> 02:42:52,260
Hello?

3343
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:54,080
We're just making everybody panic.

3344
02:43:01,940 --> 02:43:03,820
I have a walkie-talkie.

3345
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:07,280
I have a bomb.

3346
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:12,760
Don't do it.

3347
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:14,540
Don't do it.

3348
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:15,760
That's right.

3349
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:16,320
We're gonna drown.

3350
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:18,200
No one has to die needlessly.

3351
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:21,180
I have a hand.

3352
02:43:23,580 --> 02:43:25,160
Let me give you a hand.

3353
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:25,720
Oh my god!

3354
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,160
There are the Grilukavitch soldiers.

3355
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:33,620
We're almost at the target.

3356
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:34,800
Get a move on.

3357
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:36,720
They're working on it.

3358
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:41,240
Revolver.

3359
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:42,160
I have a walkie-talkie.

3360
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:46,420
My ears.

3361
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:49,310
Oh my god.

3362
02:43:49,390 --> 02:43:49,690
Please.

3363
02:43:49,930 --> 02:43:52,590
Could we do without the realistic sound effects here?

3364
02:43:55,370 --> 02:43:57,050
What do you intend to do with rain?

3365
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:58,650
Sell it on the streets?

3366
02:43:59,250 --> 02:44:01,110
I was raised in Snezinsk.

3367
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:04,930
Formerly known as Chelyabinsk 70, the nuclear research outpost.

3368
02:44:05,130 --> 02:44:06,290
Research outpost.

3369
02:44:06,490 --> 02:44:07,490
What are you talking about?

3370
02:44:07,770 --> 02:44:10,230
After the Cold War ended, my home was bought out by the Americans.

3371
02:44:10,230 --> 02:44:11,750
I didn't ask for your life story.

3372
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:16,070
Is there a point to this sad story?

3373
02:44:16,290 --> 02:44:17,110
Not you understand.

3374
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:20,670
Land, friends, dignity, all sold to the highest bidder.

3375
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:21,870
The United States of America.

3376
02:44:22,230 --> 02:44:25,370
Even the technology that gave birth to these weapons is Russian.

3377
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:26,810
Developed by us.

3378
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:27,570
By us?

3379
02:44:27,570 --> 02:44:28,750
What do you intend to do?

3380
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:32,770
Russia will rise again.

3381
02:44:33,890 --> 02:44:35,630
And rain is the key.

3382
02:44:36,530 --> 02:44:41,470
I regret to inform you that I have no intention of selling Metal Gear.

3383
02:44:41,870 --> 02:44:45,070
As I said, I came to take it back.

3384
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:46,110
Wait.

3385
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:48,490
Ocelot, you couldn't be...

3386
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:52,050
You couldn't be double-crossing them, could you?

3387
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:55,190
No.

3388
02:44:55,470 --> 02:44:56,550
You wouldn't do that.

3389
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:57,430
Yes?

3390
02:44:57,430 --> 02:44:57,670
Oh.

3391
02:44:58,010 --> 02:44:59,670
Returned to the Patriots.

3392
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,810
Hello, hello, hello.

3393
02:45:02,890 --> 02:45:04,830
How's that possible, Ocelot?

3394
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:06,910
Surely not.

3395
02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:07,790
Yes.

3396
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:11,530
I was never in your employ, Golukovich.

3397
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:13,810
This home was bought out by the Americans.

3398
02:45:13,810 --> 02:45:15,050
Sorry for the spoilers.

3399
02:45:15,570 --> 02:45:17,230
No hard feelings, Colonel.

3400
02:45:18,610 --> 02:45:21,190
Mother Russia can rot for all I care.

3401
02:45:21,330 --> 02:45:21,750
No.

3402
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:23,470
Since when, Ocelot?

3403
02:45:23,510 --> 02:45:24,490
When did you turn?

3404
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:26,430
I'm glad you noticed, comrade.

3405
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:27,310
Comrade.

3406
02:45:27,510 --> 02:45:30,410
I abandoned her during the Cold War.

3407
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:38,720
Metal Gear only has room for one.

3408
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:42,980
What's going on?

3409
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,920
Golukovich, you and your daughter will die here.

3410
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:46,440
No.

3411
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:47,960
Damn you!

3412
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:50,020
Can you say...

3413
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:56,480
Why do you want me to say lalalalalala?

3414
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:12,780
Not meant to.

3415
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:16,700
Mint, can you say lalalalalala for me?

3416
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,920
Why do you guys keep asking me to say lalalalalala?

3417
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:25,840
He's too good.

3418
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:30,140
Gosh, Ocelot, he's pretty good.

3419
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:38,620
Imagine your final words being treacherous dog.

3420
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:40,860
Treacherous dog!

3421
02:46:43,300 --> 02:46:44,720
Ocelot's so cool!

3422
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:45,740
Look at him go!

3423
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:45,920
Yeah!

3424
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:56,160
He's pretty good.

3425
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:01,800
I love this old man.

3426
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,280
I love this old man.

3427
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:09,620
Show's over.

3428
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:13,120
If you wish to live, I suggest you run now.

3429
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:17,200
This ship is still in the lower New York harbor.

3430
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:20,680
You may yet make it to shore if you swim for your life.

3431
02:47:22,420 --> 02:47:24,000
You blew it up at him!

3432
02:47:37,330 --> 02:47:38,990
I'm rocking, I'm rock...

3433
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:54,160
Stormtrooper aim!

3434
02:47:58,600 --> 02:47:59,120
Ocelot!

3435
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,360
Ocelot!

3436
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:04,200
Yeah, Teen Titans Robin, was that him?

3437
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:08,840
Oh, oh, oh, it twitched.

3438
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:10,180
His hand!

3439
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:12,240
He's got it back!

3440
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:21,070
No way!

3441
02:48:23,470 --> 02:48:25,150
It's been a while, brother.

3442
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:27,730
Who are you?

3443
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:30,090
You know who I am.

3444
02:48:30,410 --> 02:48:31,990
Like, like, like what?

3445
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:32,630
Like when?

3446
02:48:33,490 --> 02:48:35,150
Not so young anymore.

3447
02:48:35,490 --> 02:48:36,110
Or a snake?

3448
02:48:36,310 --> 02:48:37,010
A snake!

3449
02:48:38,790 --> 02:48:40,190
You're drowning in time.

3450
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:42,250
I know what it's like, brother.

3451
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:45,590
You're drowning in time.

3452
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:48,330
No wonder Naomi passed you over for the fox dive program.

3453
02:48:48,650 --> 02:48:49,390
I don't think she did.

3454
02:48:50,010 --> 02:48:50,250
Out!

3455
02:48:53,410 --> 02:48:55,570
Get out of my mind, liquid!

3456
02:48:58,030 --> 02:49:00,070
Is he, like, gnawing on his arm?

3457
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:07,050
He's literally, like, biting liquid.

3458
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:12,510
The price of physical prodigy.

3459
02:49:12,630 --> 02:49:15,970
A few more years and you'll be another dead clone of the old man.

3460
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:19,530
Our raw materials are vintage, brother.

3461
02:49:19,730 --> 02:49:22,990
Big Boss was in his late 50s when they created his copies.

3462
02:49:23,310 --> 02:49:23,430
Oh.

3463
02:49:25,330 --> 02:49:28,190
But I, I live on through this arm!

3464
02:49:28,890 --> 02:49:30,510
Oh my god.

3465
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:32,110
Look at Liquid's arm!

3466
02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:37,450
This part is so whack.

3467
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:40,790
I love it.

3468
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,990
Oh no.

3469
02:49:43,510 --> 02:49:43,790
Olga.

3470
02:49:45,590 --> 02:49:46,150
Golukovich.

3471
02:49:46,350 --> 02:49:47,210
Well, I say oh no.

3472
02:49:47,350 --> 02:49:48,410
I don't care about this guy.

3473
02:49:50,850 --> 02:49:52,830
I care about Olga, though.

3474
02:49:55,430 --> 02:49:56,810
That guy, he's dead too.

3475
02:49:56,810 --> 02:49:58,970
This part is so...

3476
02:50:00,090 --> 02:50:01,010
titanic coded.

3477
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:07,370
Which

3478
02:50:11,430 --> 02:50:13,190
one of your arms is possessed?

3479
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:15,110
All of me is possessed, baby!

3480
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:19,250
Oh my gosh.

3481
02:50:19,610 --> 02:50:20,630
I can't wait.

3482
02:50:20,890 --> 02:50:23,310
You guys, Ray does the cutest thing here.

3483
02:50:23,910 --> 02:50:25,870
Ray does the cutest thing!

3484
02:50:41,410 --> 02:50:41,890
Cinema.

3485
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:48,140
His roar, even cuter!

3486
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:49,160
Even cuter!

3487
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:49,900
Even cuter!

3488
02:50:49,940 --> 02:50:50,660
Even cuter!

3489
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,820
Ray does the cutest thing!

3490
02:50:56,560 --> 02:50:57,600
Oh my gosh, imagine.

3491
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,400
Suddenly you have to fight Ray.

3492
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:05,600
Oh my god, Snake.

3493
02:51:05,740 --> 02:51:06,760
Don't die on the tanker, please.

3494
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:08,280
Snake, no!

3495
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:10,420
The music.

3496
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:26,900
Oh, silly guys.

3497
02:51:29,580 --> 02:51:30,460
He's like, hey.

3498
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:32,280
Hey, stop shooting him.

3499
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:33,680
I'm gonna shoot him instead.

3500
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:37,800
Hey, stop shooting him.

3501
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:42,480
Why don't we have any counter measures for this thing?

3502
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:47,580
Look how cute he is!

3503
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,080
His eyes are really spread apart.

3504
02:51:51,940 --> 02:51:52,540
Yeah!

3505
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,280
Oh my god, don't trip!

3506
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:01,720
Oh my god, don't trip!

3507
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:03,180
When's he gonna do the thing?

3508
02:52:05,180 --> 02:52:05,780
When's he gonna do the thing?

3509
02:52:05,780 --> 02:52:07,900
I love Ray's noises too.

3510
02:52:09,140 --> 02:52:10,580
Snake, wake up, please!

3511
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:12,920
You're making me nervous.

3512
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,200
You're making me nervous, Snake.

3513
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:16,560
Please, wake up.

3514
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:17,520
Get up, Snake.

3515
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:20,480
Oh, what a nice angle.

3516
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:22,080
Oh, what a nice angle.

3517
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:24,280
I think so.

3518
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:24,640
So...

3519
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:29,320
Oh my god, here he goes!

3520
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:30,080
Yes!

3521
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:34,300
Go, go, go!

3522
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:35,580
Do your little sippies!

3523
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:38,680
Look how cute he is!

3524
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:40,620
He's sipping up!

3525
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:42,420
He's taking a big ol' sip!

3526
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:45,560
Yeah!

3527
02:52:50,480 --> 02:52:51,880
Whatcha gonna do with that sip?

3528
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:53,280
Ah, you know.

3529
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:54,740
Water, laser...

3530
02:52:57,740 --> 02:52:59,520
He's so thirsty!

3531
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:01,880
I love Ray!

3532
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:13,860
Snaaaake!

3533
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:16,440
Snaaaake!

3534
02:53:17,900 --> 02:53:21,000
Oh my god, Snake, please wake up!

3535
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:21,860
Snake!

3536
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:26,720
The cliffhanger.

3537
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,940
There he goes!

3538
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:31,100
Little Ray!

3539
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:33,320
Swimming out with his tail!

3540
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:34,580
I love this part too!

3541
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,520
Look how cute he is!

3542
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:42,860
He's so awesome!

3543
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:45,200
Oh, thank goodness!

3544
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:47,940
Snake, you're scaring me!

3545
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:56,120
Power wash simulator DLC where you play as Ray.

3546
02:53:56,340 --> 02:53:56,400
Hehehe.

3547
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:13,390
Proceeding F-Plan, sir.

3548
02:54:14,390 --> 02:54:16,430
I sawed this boat in half.

3549
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:22,120
Backflip!

3550
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:23,200
Do a flip!

3551
02:54:27,590 --> 02:54:28,870
I love Ray.

3552
02:54:29,290 --> 02:54:30,890
Ray is so awesome!

3553
02:54:30,990 --> 02:54:31,890
He's so nimble.

3554
02:54:32,130 --> 02:54:33,930
He's so special.

3555
02:54:38,130 --> 02:54:39,230
He's so great!

3556
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:45,530
Look at him swim!

3557
02:54:46,390 --> 02:54:47,030
Yes, sir!

3558
02:54:47,030 --> 02:54:49,630
I have photographic evidence of Snake on the scene.

3559
02:54:49,810 --> 02:54:51,810
The cipher was most useful.

3560
02:54:52,110 --> 02:54:53,010
Yes, sir!

3561
02:54:53,170 --> 02:54:55,930
I look forward to tomorrow morning's newsflash.

3562
02:54:56,310 --> 02:55:00,270
I would say the Marine Corps' plans are on indefinite hold.

3563
02:55:00,590 --> 02:55:01,230
I would say the Marine Corps' plans are on indefinite hold.

3564
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:01,270
I would say the Marine Corps' plans are on indefinite hold.

3565
02:55:01,270 --> 02:55:01,910
Yes, sir!

3566
02:55:02,830 --> 02:55:04,290
Mr. President!

3567
02:55:09,290 --> 02:55:12,250
Oh my god.

3568
02:55:12,310 --> 02:55:13,170
Goodbye, tanker!

3569
02:55:14,830 --> 02:55:15,470
Snaaaake!

3570
02:55:16,770 --> 02:55:17,290
Snaaaake!

3571
02:55:20,470 --> 02:55:20,990
Snaaaake!

3572
02:55:20,990 --> 02:55:21,390
Snaaaake!

3573
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:23,550
What if Snake didn't know how to swim?

3574
02:55:26,190 --> 02:55:26,990
Oh my gosh!

3575
02:55:27,010 --> 02:55:28,130
It's only been three hours!

3576
02:55:30,870 --> 02:55:33,270
That is so, like, for the course, I feel.

3577
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:34,910
I feel like...

3578
02:55:35,430 --> 02:55:39,030
It's so easy to spend so much time on just the tanker.

3579
02:55:39,170 --> 02:55:42,110
Can't believe Ocelot was possessed by Anthony from Eternal Darkness.

3580
02:55:42,510 --> 02:55:43,150
What a twist!

3581
02:55:43,690 --> 02:55:44,210
Hahaha!

3582
02:55:47,170 --> 02:55:47,750
Oh man.

3583
02:55:47,950 --> 02:55:48,190
Hey!

3584
02:55:48,390 --> 02:55:50,310
We beat Metal Gear Solid 2!

3585
02:55:51,010 --> 02:55:51,130
Oh!

3586
02:55:51,370 --> 02:55:55,470
Scientists had to make thousands of calculations to create the atomic bomb and determine its effects.

3587
02:55:55,850 --> 02:55:59,270
Computers and atomic bombs, both products of World War II, grew up together.

3588
02:56:00,410 --> 02:56:01,290
Smithsonian Institute.

3589
02:56:03,050 --> 02:56:03,970
Quickest three hours.

3590
02:56:05,850 --> 02:56:07,010
I've always assumed...

3591
02:56:07,010 --> 02:56:09,430
Snake, do you remember the sinking of that tanker two years ago?

3592
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:12,110
The arm thing is just another Ocelot triple cross.

3593
02:56:12,110 --> 02:56:15,450
Terrorists blow a hole in an oil tanker full of crude, barely 20 miles deep.

3594
02:56:15,450 --> 02:56:16,870
The tanker is possessed by liquid.

3595
02:56:17,150 --> 02:56:18,190
Your classic nightmare.

3596
02:56:18,870 --> 02:56:22,290
It didn't take long for the government to put an oil fence around the whole mess.

3597
02:56:22,710 --> 02:56:25,630
And then that massive offshore cleanup facility went up inside.

3598
02:56:26,130 --> 02:56:27,210
The big shell.

3599
02:56:27,370 --> 02:56:28,350
The big shell!

3600
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:31,450
I hear the cleanup isn't quite over yet.

3601
02:56:31,650 --> 02:56:32,670
It takes time.

3602
02:56:32,870 --> 02:56:35,010
But in the meantime, the shell's become a landmark.

3603
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:36,850
A symbol of environmental protection.

3604
02:56:37,070 --> 02:56:37,950
Snake sounds...

3605
02:56:38,990 --> 02:56:39,510
more...

3606
02:56:41,170 --> 02:56:41,690
Twinkie.

3607
02:56:41,690 --> 02:56:42,790
The team's off on Bravo.

3608
02:56:43,030 --> 02:56:44,670
Deploy at the big shell as scheduled.

3609
02:56:45,270 --> 02:56:48,690
Approximately six hours ago, the big shell was seized by an armed group.

3610
02:56:48,910 --> 02:56:49,970
Do we have an ID?

3611
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:54,430
Former members of the Navy SEAL Special Anti-Terrorist Training Squad, Dead Cell.

3612
02:56:54,890 --> 02:56:55,810
Dead Cell!

3613
02:56:57,590 --> 02:56:59,010
It's a highly trained group.

3614
02:56:59,050 --> 02:57:00,190
I love Dead Cell.

3615
02:57:00,590 --> 02:57:01,590
I hope they yell.

3616
02:57:01,890 --> 02:57:03,190
I hope they yell Dead Cell!

3617
02:57:11,690 --> 02:57:11,810
Big shell!

3618
02:57:11,930 --> 02:57:12,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3619
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:17,430
What a freak.

3620
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,730
Offshore decontainment facility.

3621
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:21,870
Big shell!

3622
02:57:31,390 --> 02:57:32,530
I'm so excited.

3623
02:57:41,870 --> 02:57:43,150
30 billion dollars.

3624
02:57:43,190 --> 02:57:44,790
30 billion dollars!

3625
02:57:45,430 --> 02:57:46,750
What makes them think they can get that much?

3626
02:57:46,750 --> 02:57:49,790
Gosh, they have really upgraded from the one million dollars before.

3627
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:50,670
There was a government sponsor, too, who owned the big shell that day.

3628
02:57:50,710 --> 02:57:52,270
Or one billion dollars, right?

3629
02:57:52,370 --> 02:57:54,990
A VIP from one of the major conservation groups.

3630
02:57:54,990 --> 02:57:56,330
And one from a Rome government.

3631
02:57:56,490 --> 02:57:58,290
The most important person in sense.

3632
02:57:58,550 --> 02:57:59,890
The most important person?

3633
02:58:00,210 --> 02:58:01,230
James Johnson.

3634
02:58:02,210 --> 02:58:07,130
Unless the demands are met, the terrorists intend to blow the big shell out of the water.

3635
02:58:07,370 --> 02:58:10,950
And the crew will ignite, turning the Manhattan harbor into an inferno.

3636
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:11,430
Oh my god.

3637
02:58:11,690 --> 02:58:12,630
This is not the worst case scenario.

3638
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:20,130
If the chlorides being used to decontaminate the sea water go up with the oil, toxins containing catastrophic levels of dioxins will be released.

3639
02:58:20,430 --> 02:58:25,370
In other words, the bay's ecosystem will be wiped out and the sea will turn into a toxic soup for centuries.

3640
02:58:25,630 --> 02:58:28,610
Becoming the worst environmental disaster in history.

3641
02:58:30,570 --> 02:58:31,530
Bad soup.

3642
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:32,650
Spicy soup.

3643
02:58:33,130 --> 02:58:35,390
I can't unhear the voice of Chuni VTuber.

3644
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:38,050
I've watched before in the past when I've played.

3645
02:58:38,090 --> 02:58:38,750
So let's watch this game.

3646
02:58:38,930 --> 02:58:40,910
Infiltrate the offshore decontamination facility.

3647
02:58:41,690 --> 02:58:44,270
And safeguard the president and other hostages.

3648
02:58:44,510 --> 02:58:48,110
And two, disarm the terrorists by any means necessary.

3649
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:48,810
That VTuber must be pretty cool.

3650
02:58:48,810 --> 02:58:50,510
If they have a voice like Ryden's.

3651
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:50,910
Hahaha.

3652
02:58:57,780 --> 02:59:02,060
You should know that SEAL Team 10 is also conducting a rescue operation.

3653
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:05,480
Soup.

3654
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:05,560
You should know that SEAL Team 10 is also conducting a rescue operation.

3655
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:06,580
The butt is acceptable.

3656
02:59:07,060 --> 02:59:07,140
The butt is acceptable.

3657
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:08,240
Is this a joint effort?

3658
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:09,340
It's just not the same.

3659
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:11,120
Foxhound remains a covert body.

3660
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:12,660
Oh my god, there's bugs everywhere.

3661
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:14,200
That is an order.

3662
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:15,080
Okay.

3663
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:16,220
I got this.

3664
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:17,880
Stealth.

3665
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:20,820
Oh my gosh, here it comes.

3666
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:21,820
Yes.

3667
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:23,000
This is Snake.

3668
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:25,760
I'm now inside Strut A of Shell 1.

3669
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:27,100
How are things?

3670
02:59:27,460 --> 02:59:27,860
I don't know.

3671
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:29,000
I don't know.

3672
02:59:29,120 --> 02:59:32,240
Why does he talk like this?

3673
02:59:33,460 --> 02:59:35,380
Why does Snake have white hair?

3674
02:59:35,820 --> 02:59:40,080
Because, you know, he got so shocked by the tanker.

3675
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:41,100
Because, you know, he got so shocked by the tanker.

3676
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:43,520
There's a brand new hole cut through the oil fence.

3677
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:44,480
Brand new hole?

3678
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:47,480
There's someone else besides me that wanted to get in badly.

3679
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:49,100
That's not possible.

3680
02:59:49,620 --> 02:59:51,060
What about SEAL Team 10?

3681
02:59:51,400 --> 02:59:51,600
That's right.

3682
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:54,240
They landed on the roof of the big shell as planned.

3683
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:55,720
And by the way, Snake.

3684
02:59:56,060 --> 02:59:58,980
We're changing your code name for all following communication.

3685
02:59:59,120 --> 02:59:59,600
Okay.

3686
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:01,340
What's wrong with Snake?

3687
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:02,920
Just a precaution.

3688
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:05,980
You are now designated Ryden.

3689
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:07,720
Ryden!

3690
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:10,880
You've already covered infiltration and VR training.

3691
03:00:11,100 --> 03:00:11,160
Huh?

3692
03:00:11,380 --> 03:00:13,800
I've completed 300 missions in VR.

3693
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:17,420
I feel like some kind of legendary mercenary.

3694
03:00:18,540 --> 03:00:20,360
Okay, we'll skip that part.

3695
03:00:21,140 --> 03:00:22,960
Make sure nobody sees you.

3696
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:23,400
Okay, Ryden.

3697
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:24,280
Don't get ahead of yourself.

3698
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:26,500
If you need to, contact me by codec.

3699
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:29,100
The frequency is 140.85.

3700
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:31,840
140.85.

3701
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:33,700
When you want to use the codec, push the select button.

3702
03:00:33,700 --> 03:00:34,760
I feel like a legend.

3703
03:00:34,920 --> 03:00:35,580
Alright, Ryden.

3704
03:00:36,620 --> 03:00:38,000
What are you talking about?

3705
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:39,280
What are you talking about?

3706
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:42,320
Press the select button.

3707
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:43,420
Thank you.

3708
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:47,000
The codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.

3709
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:47,960
It's Axel from Kingdom Hearts.

3710
03:00:47,960 --> 03:00:49,640
No one but you will be able to hear it.

3711
03:00:49,980 --> 03:00:52,180
Alright, I'll contact you if anything changes.

3712
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:52,940
Be still my heart.

3713
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:57,400
First, make your way to the upper section of the big shell.

3714
03:00:57,840 --> 03:00:59,760
How do I get up to the next level?

3715
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:02,240
How do I get up to the next level?

3716
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:04,140
There's an elevator at the far end of that area.

3717
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:04,940
Nice.

3718
03:01:04,940 --> 03:01:05,600
Use that.

3719
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:05,920
Okay.

3720
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,620
Sounds good.

3721
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:08,300
Sounds good.

3722
03:01:09,580 --> 03:01:12,620
Youre new sneaking suit uses electrofiber technology.

3723
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:15,380
A byproduct of fiber optics research.

3724
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:15,900
Wooo!

3725
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:23,040
The texture isn't far removed from rubber, but the material protects against a wide range of toxic substances.

3726
03:01:23,060 --> 03:01:24,480
Look at the pan up!

3727
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:25,600
Oh my gosh!

3728
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:26,980
Turn around for us, girl!

3729
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:29,340
He's referred to as smart skin in military R for D.

3730
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:31,580
The mask is so scary!

3731
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:33,560
Wooo!

3732
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:35,100
Wow!

3733
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:37,700
What the?

3734
03:01:37,960 --> 03:01:39,720
I was trained by a video game.

3735
03:01:43,580 --> 03:01:47,300
Colonel, there's so much pressure on my torso.

3736
03:01:47,440 --> 03:01:49,100
It's really snatching my waist.

3737
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,660
It's making my waist really tiny and grabbable.

3738
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:09,780
Yippee!

3739
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:17,140
Everybody,

3740
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:21,900
welcome to...

3741
03:02:21,900 --> 03:02:26,380
Welcome to Bug Smush Simulator.

3742
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:42,020
Welcome to the start...

3743
03:02:45,460 --> 03:02:48,100
of Metal Gear Solid 2, baby!

3744
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:49,740
We made it!

3745
03:02:51,380 --> 03:02:53,700
I recognize this from a VR stream.

3746
03:02:53,780 --> 03:02:54,100
I know!

3747
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,440
We're actually here now!

3748
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:02,530
We're actually here now.

3749
03:03:03,710 --> 03:03:04,610
So fun!

3750
03:03:07,610 --> 03:03:09,130
Oh, where's the entrance to the room?

3751
03:03:11,170 --> 03:03:12,590
Only took us four hours.

3752
03:03:12,690 --> 03:03:13,810
Three, thank you very much.

3753
03:03:14,710 --> 03:03:15,190
Oh.

3754
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:27,280
Ewww.

3755
03:03:28,780 --> 03:03:30,020
Was there anything down here?

3756
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:30,620
I can't remember.

3757
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:34,560
Is there anything in the water?

3758
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:43,300
Go in.

3759
03:03:43,640 --> 03:03:44,120
Yes?

3760
03:03:44,220 --> 03:03:44,960
Okay, I thought so.

3761
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:45,960
Alright.

3762
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:47,740
How to swim.

3763
03:03:49,180 --> 03:03:50,140
Oh, yes.

3764
03:03:50,220 --> 03:03:50,860
Thank you, Colonel.

3765
03:03:50,940 --> 03:03:51,480
Perfect timing.

3766
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:53,300
Got your feet wet?

3767
03:03:53,420 --> 03:03:55,400
These are the basic controls for swimming.

3768
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:59,120
Stroke the water and move forward by pushing the punch button.

3769
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:01,560
Push it in rapid succession to swim faster.

3770
03:04:01,900 --> 03:04:02,580
I don't feel like it.

3771
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:05,000
Change your heading with the left analog stick.

3772
03:04:05,340 --> 03:04:06,760
Up will take you up.

3773
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,280
Down takes you lower.

3774
03:04:08,460 --> 03:04:10,560
Left and right to face those directions.

3775
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:15,080
The O2 gauge will appear under your life gauge while you're underwater.

3776
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:19,380
The gauge corresponds to the amount of air you can hold from a single deep breath.

3777
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:22,320
Once the O2 gauge falls to zero, the life gauge will start to drop.

3778
03:04:22,320 --> 03:04:23,580
Is this the Moomoo's hangout?

3779
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:24,440
Okay.

3780
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:25,400
You need to be aware of that.

3781
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:25,880
Okay.

3782
03:04:27,720 --> 03:04:28,320
Punch button.

3783
03:04:28,560 --> 03:04:29,240
Which one was punch?

3784
03:04:30,620 --> 03:04:31,180
Oh, gosh.

3785
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:33,600
Oh, shoot.

3786
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:35,440
Oh, my God.

3787
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:39,020
Oh, God.

3788
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:40,000
Oh, swimming.

3789
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,500
Oh, I can't go down anymore, though.

3790
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:47,380
Is there actually something down here?

3791
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:48,280
Maybe it's later?

3792
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:51,920
Ugh.

3793
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:52,480
Ugh.

3794
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:56,940
What MGS character do you like to collab with?

3795
03:04:58,020 --> 03:04:58,380
Ocelot.

3796
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:02,020
It's there?

3797
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:03,020
Am I blind?

3798
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:05,000
I passed it?

3799
03:05:05,100 --> 03:05:05,860
I just missed it?

3800
03:05:05,960 --> 03:05:06,100
Okay.

3801
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:08,280
Oh, I see it!

3802
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:08,620
I see it!

3803
03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:08,960
I saw it!

3804
03:05:08,980 --> 03:05:09,220
I saw it!

3805
03:05:09,240 --> 03:05:09,500
I saw it!

3806
03:05:09,500 --> 03:05:09,760
I saw it!

3807
03:05:11,600 --> 03:05:12,300
No, I didn't.

3808
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:13,280
I thought I saw it.

3809
03:05:13,580 --> 03:05:14,200
I'm an idiot.

3810
03:05:14,380 --> 03:05:15,260
I thought I saw a ration.

3811
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:18,160
Um...

3812
03:05:18,880 --> 03:05:20,260
La la la la la.

3813
03:05:21,500 --> 03:05:22,400
I'm not even moving.

3814
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:24,200
Raiden is moving all on his own.

3815
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:27,540
I'm seeing the bubbles and I'm thinking it's something.

3816
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:29,500
Where did I pass it?

3817
03:05:30,100 --> 03:05:30,800
Slightly up?

3818
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:31,100
Oh.

3819
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:36,500
Oh, I see it!

3820
03:05:36,500 --> 03:05:36,720
I see it!

3821
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:37,020
I see it!

3822
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:37,200
I see it!

3823
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:37,480
I see it!

3824
03:05:38,400 --> 03:05:39,040
Get it.

3825
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:39,260
Get it.

3826
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:39,660
Right on.

3827
03:05:39,900 --> 03:05:40,300
Yes!

3828
03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:42,560
Okay.

3829
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:45,800
I always forget that, um...

3830
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:47,480
Or rather...

3831
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:51,380
You know how, like, in some games, when you swim, up is actually down?

3832
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:52,980
Down is actually up?

3833
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:55,100
That's where my confusion...

3834
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:57,460
Because it's not... it's not... it's proper in this one.

3835
03:05:57,660 --> 03:05:59,040
Up is up and down is down.

3836
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:02,120
But I'm not used to it like that.

3837
03:06:04,060 --> 03:06:08,100
I can't believe... I tried so hard to get the hyperactive libido.

3838
03:06:08,260 --> 03:06:10,060
I'm so sad I didn't get it.

3839
03:06:10,360 --> 03:06:13,560
I tried so hard to get that voice... that codec call.

3840
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:16,860
I wonder why I didn't get it.

3841
03:06:17,460 --> 03:06:17,880
No!

3842
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:21,280
Inverted is best?

3843
03:06:21,360 --> 03:06:23,960
I think when you, like, play so many inverted ones...

3844
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:25,720
It, um...

3845
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:27,360
You know, it makes it difficult.

3846
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:31,420
Oh!

3847
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:32,360
What was that?

3848
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:33,360
Oh!

3849
03:06:33,380 --> 03:06:33,660
Oh!

3850
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:34,440
Oh!

3851
03:06:40,510 --> 03:06:40,910
Oh!

3852
03:06:41,270 --> 03:06:41,890
That's not me.

3853
03:06:43,030 --> 03:06:43,910
Why am I...

3854
03:06:43,910 --> 03:06:45,590
Why are you looking around so erratically?

3855
03:06:46,070 --> 03:06:46,470
Oh!

3856
03:06:49,270 --> 03:06:50,530
There's... there's people here.

3857
03:06:53,070 --> 03:06:55,350
The codec calls are really easy to miss in this game.

3858
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:55,990
Yeah!

3859
03:06:56,470 --> 03:06:58,110
I really wanted to see that one, though.

3860
03:06:58,150 --> 03:06:58,670
It's so funny.

3861
03:06:58,670 --> 03:06:59,930
It lives rent-free in my brain.

3862
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:03,350
I can never stop thinking about...

3863
03:07:03,350 --> 03:07:06,570
about Snake's hyperactive libido.

3864
03:07:06,850 --> 03:07:11,730
A Russian private army that was in line to work with the Shadow Moses takeover group four years ago.

3865
03:07:12,170 --> 03:07:14,090
What's their stake in this one?

3866
03:07:14,490 --> 03:07:16,010
They must have made a deal.

3867
03:07:16,190 --> 03:07:17,830
An arrangement with the terrorists.

3868
03:07:18,290 --> 03:07:20,250
They've become a band of mercenaries.

3869
03:07:20,410 --> 03:07:21,990
An army without a country.

3870
03:07:23,130 --> 03:07:23,690
Oh!

3871
03:07:26,130 --> 03:07:26,690
Colonel!

3872
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:30,550
Are you with anybody else?

3873
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:32,930
The elevator is at the extreme north end.

3874
03:07:32,930 --> 03:07:33,710
The extreme north!

3875
03:07:33,710 --> 03:07:36,250
Take the elevator to the upper section of the big shell.

3876
03:07:36,310 --> 03:07:37,770
The totally tubular north.

3877
03:07:38,830 --> 03:07:40,310
The radical north.

3878
03:07:41,610 --> 03:07:42,990
Hope there's nobody here.

3879
03:07:43,510 --> 03:07:45,870
Oh my god, I can't wait to take off this stupid mask.

3880
03:07:49,270 --> 03:07:50,630
Army with no nation?

3881
03:07:54,790 --> 03:07:55,650
Right in.

3882
03:07:56,010 --> 03:07:56,870
Be sneaky.

3883
03:07:58,850 --> 03:07:59,410
Oh!

3884
03:08:00,830 --> 03:08:01,890
He took him out.

3885
03:08:01,950 --> 03:08:02,170
Oh!

3886
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:03,250
He took him out.

3887
03:08:03,430 --> 03:08:03,830
Wow!

3888
03:08:04,210 --> 03:08:07,990
He took out that ass!

3889
03:08:09,150 --> 03:08:10,930
I know that ass.

3890
03:08:11,230 --> 03:08:11,790
Anywhere!

3891
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:19,160
Colonel, there's definitely another intruder in here besides me.

3892
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:20,520
Oh, and he's sexy.

3893
03:08:20,940 --> 03:08:21,960
Not a team.

3894
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:23,640
Looks like a solo job.

3895
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:24,960
One man.

3896
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:27,200
We may not know who he is.

3897
03:08:27,220 --> 03:08:30,600
But he managed to take care of every sentry in the area.

3898
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:32,040
They're all out cold.

3899
03:08:32,240 --> 03:08:32,680
He's crazy.

3900
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:34,980
He's got some skills.

3901
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:36,640
We need to get an ID.

3902
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:41,000
But for now, you can take advantage of the situation and get to work.

3903
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:43,280
There's a terminal in front of the elevator.

3904
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:44,120
A node.

3905
03:08:44,600 --> 03:08:45,800
Did you say nerd?

3906
03:08:46,140 --> 03:08:47,300
Not nerd.

3907
03:08:47,640 --> 03:08:48,200
Node.

3908
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:53,800
Use the node to gain access to the big shell's facilities network.

3909
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:54,860
Then what?

3910
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:56,720
Pull up the map of the structure.

3911
03:08:56,720 --> 03:08:59,600
That'll let you activate the soliton radar.

3912
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:01,260
The soliton radar?

3913
03:09:02,220 --> 03:09:02,780
True.

3914
03:09:02,900 --> 03:09:05,740
That radar came in useful during VR training.

3915
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:07,620
A radar system.

3916
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:08,280
Oh my god.

3917
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:11,080
Uses biological magnetic fields as input.

3918
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:11,460
I love this game.

3919
03:09:11,720 --> 03:09:14,960
These estimated enemy positions are projected onto a map.

3920
03:09:15,180 --> 03:09:15,480
Did you say nerd?

3921
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:19,940
According to reference points collected via GPS signals and field personnel reports.

3922
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:21,740
I think one of my favorite parts is that is like...

3923
03:09:21,740 --> 03:09:23,540
We need to get to the map through the big shell's node.

3924
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:25,300
Not even a localization thing.

3925
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:26,580
That's just one-to-one training.

3926
03:09:26,580 --> 03:09:26,880
No translation.

3927
03:09:27,180 --> 03:09:29,040
The node unit is about three feet high.

3928
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:30,600
Should be colored blue.

3929
03:09:30,860 --> 03:09:31,900
So it's just so stupid.

3930
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:32,960
Each area has at least one.

3931
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:35,640
How do I gain access?

3932
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:36,300
Did you say mint?

3933
03:09:37,720 --> 03:09:40,700
Just push the action button in front of the node.

3934
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:41,720
In front of the nerd.

3935
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:43,480
I'm gonna action the nerd.

3936
03:09:43,900 --> 03:09:46,140
The nanomachines in your body will take care of the security clearance.

3937
03:09:46,260 --> 03:09:46,740
Nanomachines!

3938
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:48,520
And allow you access to the node.

3939
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:51,920
Complete the procedure before those sentries gain consciousness.

3940
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:53,460
If they spot you, you won't be able to gain access for a while.

3941
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:53,760
I don't know.

3942
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:55,200
Why do I have nanomachines in my body?

3943
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:56,180
You won't be able to gain access for a while.

3944
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:56,560
You won't be able to gain access for a while.

3945
03:09:56,560 --> 03:09:57,580
Stay on guard.

3946
03:09:57,820 --> 03:09:58,140
Okay.

3947
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:58,600
Got it.

3948
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:00,720
Got it.

3949
03:10:17,940 --> 03:10:18,660
Oh my god.

3950
03:10:18,700 --> 03:10:19,800
We get to put in our name here.

3951
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:23,120
Beep boop boop bop.

3952
03:10:27,180 --> 03:10:29,480
Why are the nanomachines doing this?

3953
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:34,980
Why?

3954
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:35,860
Why?

3955
03:10:36,380 --> 03:10:36,900
Why?

3956
03:10:38,960 --> 03:10:39,480
Oh.

3957
03:10:39,660 --> 03:10:40,140
Zzz.

3958
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:41,540
My nanomachines.

3959
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:41,860
My name.

3960
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:04,240
I'm a lovely lady.

3961
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:06,180
My birthday.

3962
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:12,070
December.

3963
03:11:14,250 --> 03:11:15,450
October 1st.

3964
03:11:15,870 --> 03:11:16,990
My blood type.

3965
03:11:17,230 --> 03:11:18,170
Question mark.

3966
03:11:18,270 --> 03:11:20,430
Because I am a ghost.

3967
03:11:20,950 --> 03:11:22,290
My nationality.

3968
03:11:23,170 --> 03:11:23,770
Ghost.

3969
03:11:25,470 --> 03:11:26,870
Where did I put question mark?

3970
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:28,290
Ah.

3971
03:11:28,330 --> 03:11:29,870
We'll just be of the USA baby.

3972
03:11:31,230 --> 03:11:32,250
The U.S.

3973
03:11:32,250 --> 03:11:32,550
of A.

3974
03:11:32,990 --> 03:11:34,250
The U.S.

3975
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,250
of A.

3976
03:11:34,270 --> 03:11:34,450
But...

3977
03:11:35,150 --> 03:11:35,470
Stop.

3978
03:11:39,930 --> 03:11:40,570
Zanzibar.

3979
03:11:41,810 --> 03:11:42,450
Boop.

3980
03:11:43,330 --> 03:11:43,970
Yippee!

3981
03:11:44,130 --> 03:11:46,350
We get all of our options here.

3982
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:47,930
So fun.

3983
03:11:54,250 --> 03:11:54,890
Yeah.

3984
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:55,850
Good work Raiden.

3985
03:11:55,930 --> 03:11:56,450
Thank you.

3986
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:57,890
The radar should be functioning now.

3987
03:11:58,070 --> 03:12:00,550
Remember your VR training sessions.

3988
03:12:00,610 --> 03:12:00,970
Okay.

3989
03:12:01,070 --> 03:12:02,950
The tool is exactly the same one.

3990
03:12:05,950 --> 03:12:06,630
Okay.

3991
03:12:11,050 --> 03:12:13,270
I love that you get the tutorial now.

3992
03:12:19,450 --> 03:12:20,130
Yippee!

3993
03:12:21,510 --> 03:12:22,190
Ow!

3994
03:12:22,930 --> 03:12:23,250
Ow.

3995
03:12:23,490 --> 03:12:26,590
The tutorial you get replaying MGS is infectious, Minto.

3996
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:29,010
Thanks, Zachary.

3997
03:12:30,590 --> 03:12:31,270
Zachy.

3998
03:12:32,950 --> 03:12:35,090
You have strong harmonic resonance, so be careful.

3999
03:12:36,070 --> 03:12:40,350
The Big Shell's layout map should now be available after touching the start button.

4000
03:12:40,610 --> 03:12:41,370
Ah, yippee!

4001
03:12:42,470 --> 03:12:47,890
I've set aside proprietary frequency for saves and an analyst to work on the data, too.

4002
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:48,530
Who could it be?

4003
03:12:48,850 --> 03:12:50,270
Jack, is everything all right?

4004
03:12:50,630 --> 03:12:51,470
What are you doing here?

4005
03:12:51,790 --> 03:12:52,970
Jack, can you hear me?

4006
03:12:53,310 --> 03:12:55,110
Rose, you're not supposed to be involved.

4007
03:12:55,590 --> 03:12:56,710
What's going on?

4008
03:12:56,930 --> 03:12:58,630
Jack, I'm a part of this mission.

4009
03:12:59,090 --> 03:13:00,810
Colonel, what the hell is going on?

4010
03:13:00,910 --> 03:13:01,610
Excuse me?

4011
03:13:03,430 --> 03:13:05,690
She'll be overseeing the data saving and support.

4012
03:13:06,010 --> 03:13:06,850
Why her?

4013
03:13:07,290 --> 03:13:08,170
Why her?

4014
03:13:08,170 --> 03:13:11,010
The Foxhound analyst that was supposed to take part in this mission was in an accident.

4015
03:13:11,730 --> 03:13:13,390
Rosemary was brought in as a replacement.

4016
03:13:14,070 --> 03:13:15,510
An accident, you see.

4017
03:13:15,510 --> 03:13:18,410
And according to the files, she knows you better than anybody else.

4018
03:13:19,390 --> 03:13:19,890
Let's go!

4019
03:13:20,750 --> 03:13:23,570
But an intelligence analyst is no field officer.

4020
03:13:24,150 --> 03:13:25,090
Not to worry.

4021
03:13:25,270 --> 03:13:27,330
She has our technical staff at her disposal.

4022
03:13:27,890 --> 03:13:29,930
She's never been a part of a field mission.

4023
03:13:30,070 --> 03:13:30,950
This is insane.

4024
03:13:31,770 --> 03:13:33,350
This is my favorite couple!

4025
03:13:33,350 --> 03:13:34,670
I have my own reasons for selecting her for this mission, Sergeant.

4026
03:13:34,990 --> 03:13:36,730
Colonel, I fail to see...

4027
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:39,230
I know your VR training performance in and out.

4028
03:13:39,410 --> 03:13:41,230
But sometimes that's not enough.

4029
03:13:41,590 --> 03:13:42,070
Yeah.

4030
03:13:42,130 --> 03:13:43,890
You're familiar with the Shadow Moses incident?

4031
03:13:44,370 --> 03:13:45,990
You know I covered it in VR.

4032
03:13:46,090 --> 03:13:47,330
Oh yeah, 300 missions.

4033
03:13:47,490 --> 03:13:49,570
If there's a crucial tactical detail that case taught us...

4034
03:13:49,570 --> 03:13:49,890
What's that?

4035
03:13:50,010 --> 03:13:52,190
It was the power of the operatives' will to survive.

4036
03:13:52,630 --> 03:13:52,810
Ooh.

4037
03:13:53,010 --> 03:13:54,290
I was trained to fight.

4038
03:13:54,530 --> 03:13:57,250
My personal feelings have no place in a mission.

4039
03:13:57,630 --> 03:13:59,790
We've learned that it doesn't work that way.

4040
03:13:59,790 --> 03:14:02,950
And on the field, you need all the help you can get.

4041
03:14:03,030 --> 03:14:03,570
I need a lady.

4042
03:14:03,590 --> 03:14:05,950
Jack, you're stuck with me whether you like it or not.

4043
03:14:06,570 --> 03:14:07,010
Rose.

4044
03:14:07,410 --> 03:14:07,850
Rose!

4045
03:14:07,950 --> 03:14:09,210
You need someone to watch your back.

4046
03:14:09,630 --> 03:14:12,550
But I have conditions that need to be met, Colonel.

4047
03:14:12,690 --> 03:14:14,210
Ooh, she's a lady with conditions.

4048
03:14:14,510 --> 03:14:16,370
I'll perform my duties and save that mission data.

4049
03:14:16,590 --> 03:14:16,790
Good.

4050
03:14:16,850 --> 03:14:20,230
But I'm aware that technically I'm not part of the mission control team.

4051
03:14:20,410 --> 03:14:20,810
Yes.

4052
03:14:20,930 --> 03:14:23,830
After all, I'm just a normal girl who's worried about Jack.

4053
03:14:23,830 --> 03:14:24,430
She's just a normal girl.

4054
03:14:24,990 --> 03:14:28,590
But that means, Colonel, that I am not required to follow your orders...

4055
03:14:28,590 --> 03:14:29,090
How self-centered.

4056
03:14:29,090 --> 03:14:30,090
...of my immediate duties.

4057
03:14:30,590 --> 03:14:33,470
Jack is not simply a field personnel for me to track.

4058
03:14:33,790 --> 03:14:36,790
His safety comes first to me, not the mission.

4059
03:14:37,010 --> 03:14:37,750
How self-centered.

4060
03:14:37,750 --> 03:14:43,490
And because of that, I will be monitoring and keeping a record of every communication you have with him, Colonel.

4061
03:14:43,950 --> 03:14:47,090
Given the circumstances, you're free to do what you see fit.

4062
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:50,630
Hey, I prefer this to being kept in the dark waiting.

4063
03:14:51,050 --> 03:14:52,970
I'd like to make a request, if I may.

4064
03:14:53,230 --> 03:14:53,590
Yes?

4065
03:14:53,690 --> 03:14:54,170
Of course.

4066
03:14:54,550 --> 03:14:56,030
His handle is Ryden.

4067
03:14:56,390 --> 03:14:58,030
For the duration of the mission...

4068
03:14:58,030 --> 03:14:59,310
Could you call him that?

4069
03:14:59,950 --> 03:15:00,630
Yes, sir.

4070
03:15:00,910 --> 03:15:02,490
All right, Ryden.

4071
03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:03,250
Ryden.

4072
03:15:03,270 --> 03:15:05,090
Let me know when you're ready to turn in a save.

4073
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:06,430
How long do you think that's gonna last?

4074
03:15:06,490 --> 03:15:09,550
The proprietary save frequency is 140.96.

4075
03:15:09,550 --> 03:15:11,590
How long do you think she's gonna call him Ryden for?

4076
03:15:11,950 --> 03:15:14,310
I just switched frequencies, Jack.

4077
03:15:14,630 --> 03:15:15,030
What?

4078
03:15:15,450 --> 03:15:16,890
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

4079
03:15:17,670 --> 03:15:18,470
April 30th.

4080
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:20,330
Is there something special about it?

4081
03:15:20,330 --> 03:15:21,250
Oh god, it's already starting.

4082
03:15:21,570 --> 03:15:21,610
Isn't there?

4083
03:15:21,830 --> 03:15:22,550
Oh no.

4084
03:15:22,570 --> 03:15:22,670
I can't remember.

4085
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:23,510
I'm sorry.

4086
03:15:24,430 --> 03:15:25,350
I'm so excited.

4087
03:15:25,570 --> 03:15:26,750
I'll keep trying until I hear the answer.

4088
03:15:26,750 --> 03:15:27,350
I should have...

4089
03:15:27,350 --> 03:15:28,710
I'm gonna let you go now, Jack.

4090
03:15:29,090 --> 03:15:29,790
Take care.

4091
03:15:29,950 --> 03:15:32,230
I should have had a heartbeat monitor on for this game.

4092
03:15:32,330 --> 03:15:33,110
Maybe next time.

4093
03:15:33,170 --> 03:15:34,350
Oh my god.

4094
03:15:36,750 --> 03:15:37,670
They're gonna wake up.

4095
03:15:37,710 --> 03:15:38,270
They're gonna wake up.

4096
03:15:38,270 --> 03:15:38,950
They're gonna wake up.

4097
03:15:40,210 --> 03:15:40,810
Uh-oh.

4098
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:48,010
Ryden, the enemy sentry is regaining consciousness.

4099
03:15:48,470 --> 03:15:49,570
Be careful, Jack.

4100
03:15:49,970 --> 03:15:50,390
Ryden.

4101
03:15:50,410 --> 03:15:50,610
My name is Ryden.

4102
03:15:50,610 --> 03:15:52,330
Find somewhere to hide until the elevator arrives.

4103
03:15:52,610 --> 03:15:54,450
You must stay out of sight.

4104
03:15:54,650 --> 03:15:55,710
Please, Rose.

4105
03:15:55,870 --> 03:15:56,290
My...

4106
03:15:56,290 --> 03:15:56,730
I can't...

4107
03:15:56,750 --> 03:15:58,330
You have one job.

4108
03:15:58,610 --> 03:15:59,190
Oh my god.

4109
03:16:01,130 --> 03:16:02,670
I'm under enemy fire.

4110
03:16:03,030 --> 03:16:04,050
Secure the perimeter.

4111
03:16:04,670 --> 03:16:05,190
Secure...

4112
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:05,630
Oh my god.

4113
03:16:11,820 --> 03:16:12,580
Oh my god.

4114
03:16:12,600 --> 03:16:12,860
I'm scared.

4115
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:13,560
I'm scared.

4116
03:16:17,600 --> 03:16:18,120
Nothing?

4117
03:16:19,560 --> 03:16:19,980
No one?

4118
03:16:20,080 --> 03:16:20,760
There's no one?

4119
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:21,340
There's nothing.

4120
03:16:21,620 --> 03:16:22,220
It's the enemy.

4121
03:16:22,420 --> 03:16:22,920
Andy Dell.

4122
03:16:23,140 --> 03:16:23,800
No, you don't.

4123
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:24,940
No way.

4124
03:16:25,060 --> 03:16:25,400
Already?

4125
03:16:25,800 --> 03:16:26,320
Please.

4126
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:27,760
No additional assistance.

4127
03:16:28,360 --> 03:16:29,340
No additional assistance.

4128
03:16:29,360 --> 03:16:30,120
Bozo.

4129
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:30,960
Sorry.

4130
03:16:32,140 --> 03:16:32,620
Um...

4131
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:33,940
I don't know where he is.

4132
03:16:34,060 --> 03:16:34,460
Oh god.

4133
03:16:34,580 --> 03:16:35,160
Where is he?

4134
03:16:35,280 --> 03:16:35,860
Oh god.

4135
03:16:35,900 --> 03:16:36,340
Where is he?

4136
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:37,120
Ah!

4137
03:16:37,300 --> 03:16:38,180
The elevator's here!

4138
03:16:38,940 --> 03:16:40,080
Just go, Ryden.

4139
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:40,520
Just go.

4140
03:16:43,080 --> 03:16:44,040
Nothing here.

4141
03:16:44,660 --> 03:16:45,140
Anyway.

4142
03:16:45,980 --> 03:16:47,740
Yeah, I said that nobody can help.

4143
03:16:49,100 --> 03:16:50,060
So sad.

4144
03:16:54,120 --> 03:16:54,600
Yeah!

4145
03:16:55,520 --> 03:16:57,040
No problems here, everybody.

4146
03:16:57,260 --> 03:16:58,300
The perfect escape.

4147
03:16:58,680 --> 03:16:59,320
Oh my god.

4148
03:16:59,320 --> 03:16:59,340
Oh my god.

4149
03:16:59,360 --> 03:16:59,440
Oh my gosh.

4150
03:16:59,440 --> 03:17:00,300
It's just like...

4151
03:17:00,300 --> 03:17:02,140
The terrors call themselves Sons of Liberty.

4152
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:03,220
Sons of Liberty!

4153
03:17:04,300 --> 03:17:07,060
The name of their leader is Solid Snake.

4154
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:07,400
Huh?

4155
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:13,580
The hero of Shadow Moses?

4156
03:17:14,020 --> 03:17:16,580
So that's why you changed my code name.

4157
03:17:16,860 --> 03:17:17,200
Right.

4158
03:17:17,440 --> 03:17:19,660
But he can't be the Solid Snake.

4159
03:17:19,780 --> 03:17:20,140
Yeah.

4160
03:17:20,220 --> 03:17:23,040
He died two years ago on that tanker.

4161
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:23,720
Snake died!

4162
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:25,000
After he built Sky High.

4163
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:28,340
Could he have survived?

4164
03:17:28,620 --> 03:17:29,340
Not just because he's alive, but because he's alive.

4165
03:17:29,360 --> 03:17:29,700
He ripped his pants.

4166
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:30,220
Not a chance.

4167
03:17:32,340 --> 03:17:34,920
It's just like the opening of Metal Gear Solid 1.

4168
03:17:36,540 --> 03:17:37,420
Solid Snake?

4169
03:17:37,640 --> 03:17:38,240
It couldn't be.

4170
03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:40,480
That guy's not working for the... for the terrorists?

4171
03:17:40,540 --> 03:17:41,660
There are no sentries.

4172
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:44,720
But it would only take one to spot me in this light.

4173
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,880
You never had daylight VR training after all.

4174
03:17:48,080 --> 03:17:48,540
How...

4175
03:17:48,540 --> 03:17:50,040
What a huge oversight.

4176
03:17:50,600 --> 03:17:51,820
Stay extra sharp until you can find a node to log in from.

4177
03:17:52,100 --> 03:17:53,560
What about the commandos?

4178
03:17:53,760 --> 03:17:55,040
SEAL Team 10 is...

4179
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:56,180
What a huge oversight.

4180
03:17:56,580 --> 03:17:57,000
...E and C.

4181
03:17:57,400 --> 03:17:58,340
And the president?

4182
03:17:58,720 --> 03:17:59,340
Seems to be...

4183
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:00,860
He was spotted on Strut B.

4184
03:18:01,440 --> 03:18:02,300
Strut B.

4185
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:02,520
Strut B?

4186
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:08,580
300 video games and not one in daylight.

4187
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:09,380
Yeah.

4188
03:18:09,420 --> 03:18:10,740
Shadow Moses was all at night.

4189
03:18:10,740 --> 03:18:12,700
The Big Shell is comprised of Shells 1 and 2.

4190
03:18:12,860 --> 03:18:13,240
Oh my god.

4191
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:13,500
We love Big Shell.

4192
03:18:13,500 --> 03:18:16,420
Each unit consists of a central core and six struts surrounding it.

4193
03:18:16,420 --> 03:18:17,440
We love Big Shell.

4194
03:18:17,660 --> 03:18:21,360
So the whole thing is shaped like two hexagons connected end on end.

4195
03:18:21,560 --> 03:18:21,840
Yeah.

4196
03:18:22,140 --> 03:18:22,620
Exactly.

4197
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:24,540
And you're on the roof of Strut A.

4198
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:26,040
Shell 1 at the moment.

4199
03:18:26,860 --> 03:18:27,820
So awesome.

4200
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:29,320
Yeah.

4201
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:30,280
We love Big Shell.

4202
03:18:30,280 --> 03:18:31,320
Big Shell is so pretty.

4203
03:18:31,540 --> 03:18:32,980
First, get to a node.

4204
03:18:33,180 --> 03:18:34,380
Log into the network.

4205
03:18:34,600 --> 03:18:34,900
The node.

4206
03:18:34,900 --> 03:18:35,340
Got it.

4207
03:18:42,060 --> 03:18:43,240
What time is it?

4208
03:18:43,480 --> 03:18:43,920
Okay.

4209
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:45,120
I still have a little bit of time.

4210
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:46,120
What's this?

4211
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:47,440
Get up there.

4212
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:47,820
Rhino.

4213
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:50,680
Bandage.

4214
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:51,900
We'll need those.

4215
03:18:53,440 --> 03:18:53,880
But...

4216
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:54,120
Ew.

4217
03:18:56,620 --> 03:18:57,640
Don't poop on me.

4218
03:18:58,300 --> 03:18:59,320
We'll get the M9.

4219
03:18:59,320 --> 03:18:59,680
Don't poop on mine first.

4220
03:19:00,720 --> 03:19:01,860
Don't poop on me.

4221
03:19:01,980 --> 03:19:02,820
Don't poop on me.

4222
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:04,780
Don't poop on me!

4223
03:19:07,320 --> 03:19:08,900
Let's see how Rose is doing.

4224
03:19:10,220 --> 03:19:11,160
My girlfriend.

4225
03:19:13,880 --> 03:19:16,600
You know, I just wanted to see her face.

4226
03:19:18,140 --> 03:19:19,100
Also save.

4227
03:19:25,410 --> 03:19:25,990
Yeah.

4228
03:19:26,850 --> 03:19:27,430
Saving!

4229
03:19:28,110 --> 03:19:28,690
Nice.

4230
03:19:34,370 --> 03:19:36,350
I'm sorry, but I still don't have a clue.

4231
03:19:36,810 --> 03:19:37,490
That's okay.

4232
03:19:37,850 --> 03:19:38,690
What is it, Rose?

4233
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:39,550
Talk to me.

4234
03:19:41,670 --> 03:19:42,830
He's such a freak.

4235
03:19:43,190 --> 03:19:43,750
How important?

4236
03:19:44,330 --> 03:19:45,090
Important enough.

4237
03:19:45,530 --> 03:19:46,890
And we'll talk about it tomorrow.

4238
03:19:47,170 --> 03:19:48,110
Rose, can't you give me a hint?

4239
03:19:48,350 --> 03:19:48,610
Yeah.

4240
03:19:48,890 --> 03:19:50,850
Tomorrow seems more appropriate.

4241
03:19:51,150 --> 03:19:51,730
That's a death flag.

4242
03:19:51,750 --> 03:19:54,310
I need all the help I can get so that I won't chicken out anyway.

4243
03:19:54,470 --> 03:19:55,490
Rose, that's a death flag.

4244
03:19:55,490 --> 03:19:57,410
Is that the reason you decided to be part of this mission?

4245
03:19:58,670 --> 03:19:59,070
Okay.

4246
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:01,950
I'm gonna finish this thing by tomorrow no matter what.

4247
03:20:02,110 --> 03:20:03,070
No matter what.

4248
03:20:03,110 --> 03:20:03,550
You know I'll do everything I can.

4249
03:20:04,350 --> 03:20:04,830
Okay.

4250
03:20:05,130 --> 03:20:08,010
Rose, there's something I need you to do as an analyst.

4251
03:20:08,290 --> 03:20:08,690
As an analyst?

4252
03:20:08,690 --> 03:20:08,930
What is it?

4253
03:20:09,170 --> 03:20:10,770
It has to do with Solid Snake.

4254
03:20:10,990 --> 03:20:14,410
The leader of this takeover incident is claiming that he's Snake himself.

4255
03:20:15,010 --> 03:20:16,310
The legendary mercenary?

4256
03:20:16,550 --> 03:20:19,510
I need as much data on him as possible.

4257
03:20:19,850 --> 03:20:22,790
Everything they have on him after the Shadow Moses incident.

4258
03:20:23,150 --> 03:20:24,650
He's dead now, isn't he?

4259
03:20:24,890 --> 03:20:25,290
Yes.

4260
03:20:25,550 --> 03:20:27,570
Should be a burial record somewhere, too.

4261
03:20:27,790 --> 03:20:31,290
You should be able to request top-level security clearance from the Colonel.

4262
03:20:31,550 --> 03:20:32,330
What about you, Mint?

4263
03:20:32,330 --> 03:20:33,550
Do you know what they want?

4264
03:20:33,550 --> 03:20:34,970
I'm on it.

4265
03:20:34,990 --> 03:20:37,130
I'll contact you as soon as I find out something.

4266
03:20:37,270 --> 03:20:37,410
I don't.

4267
03:20:37,410 --> 03:20:37,770
I have no idea.

4268
03:20:37,850 --> 03:20:38,330
I'm Raiden.

4269
03:20:38,910 --> 03:20:39,630
I'm an idiot.

4270
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:43,190
So they even have his records?

4271
03:20:43,670 --> 03:20:44,710
How is that possible?

4272
03:20:44,910 --> 03:20:46,890
Wait, did they recover it from the ship?

4273
03:20:47,610 --> 03:20:48,850
Snake is really dead?

4274
03:20:50,070 --> 03:20:54,910
According to the SEAL Team 10's communications, the President was sighted on Strut B.

4275
03:20:55,410 --> 03:20:57,390
Raiden, head for Strut B.

4276
03:20:57,630 --> 03:21:00,990
It's to the northwest of Strut A, your current location.

4277
03:21:01,750 --> 03:21:04,850
Cross the connecting bridge between Strut A and B.

4278
03:21:05,090 --> 03:21:07,590
You can get to the connecting bridge from the first floor.

4279
03:21:07,870 --> 03:21:07,910
I feel like I'm in elementary.

4280
03:21:08,750 --> 03:21:09,430
Strut B.

4281
03:21:09,890 --> 03:21:11,630
From A you go to B.

4282
03:21:11,750 --> 03:21:13,230
A, B, C.

4283
03:21:13,730 --> 03:21:14,290
A.

4284
03:21:15,910 --> 03:21:16,870
Strut A.

4285
03:21:17,850 --> 03:21:18,790
Strut A.

4286
03:21:18,850 --> 03:21:19,510
Strut B.

4287
03:21:22,430 --> 03:21:22,990
Okay.

4288
03:21:24,550 --> 03:21:25,330
Hold on.

4289
03:21:25,430 --> 03:21:27,530
I have something very important I need to do.

4290
03:21:28,090 --> 03:21:28,650
Whoa!

4291
03:21:31,090 --> 03:21:32,090
Get up, Raiden.

4292
03:21:32,970 --> 03:21:34,790
Look at that nasty poop.

4293
03:21:35,010 --> 03:21:35,190
Ew!

4294
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:37,690
Hit me.

4295
03:21:38,170 --> 03:21:38,970
Hit me, bird.

4296
03:21:39,070 --> 03:21:39,530
I dare you.

4297
03:21:39,570 --> 03:21:39,890
Hit me.

4298
03:21:40,210 --> 03:21:41,030
Hit me, bird.

4299
03:21:41,750 --> 03:21:42,550
Poop on me.

4300
03:21:42,830 --> 03:21:43,730
Poop on me, bird.

4301
03:21:43,790 --> 03:21:44,310
Poop on me.

4302
03:21:49,750 --> 03:21:50,550
Look up.

4303
03:22:00,870 --> 03:22:01,270
Disgusting.

4304
03:22:06,810 --> 03:22:07,210
Hello?

4305
03:22:07,210 --> 03:22:07,970
Is it Rose?

4306
03:22:09,210 --> 03:22:09,690
Aw.

4307
03:22:10,390 --> 03:22:12,070
Raiden, look at that wire fence.

4308
03:22:13,550 --> 03:22:15,490
You may be able to crawl through it.

4309
03:22:15,490 --> 03:22:16,430
Dramatic pause.

4310
03:22:17,190 --> 03:22:18,570
That's literally what I was doing.

4311
03:22:18,870 --> 03:22:20,170
Crouch down using the crawl button.

4312
03:22:20,350 --> 03:22:23,350
Then push the left analog stick in the direction you want to move.

4313
03:22:23,410 --> 03:22:23,950
That's what I was doing, Colonel.

4314
03:22:24,110 --> 03:22:25,950
Push the crawl button again to stand up.

4315
03:22:26,470 --> 03:22:28,690
You can use weapons even while crawling.

4316
03:22:28,870 --> 03:22:32,090
This is different from VR training, so you keep that in mind.

4317
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:33,450
Yeah, you can.

4318
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:36,110
Thank you for reminding me, Colonel.

4319
03:22:37,030 --> 03:22:37,770
Oh, whoops.

4320
03:22:37,770 --> 03:22:40,530
I think I was thinking of crouching and shooting.

4321
03:22:40,770 --> 03:22:41,310
Oh, hello?

4322
03:22:41,470 --> 03:22:41,850
Again?

4323
03:22:44,510 --> 03:22:46,690
Raiden, SEAL Team 10 is in.

4324
03:22:46,930 --> 03:22:47,210
Yippee!

4325
03:22:47,370 --> 03:22:50,310
Do we really have no line of communication with the SEALs?

4326
03:22:50,350 --> 03:22:50,790
I mean, wait.

4327
03:22:50,810 --> 03:22:52,210
They don't know a thing about us.

4328
03:22:52,370 --> 03:22:55,430
You know we work in the dark, and this mission is no exception.

4329
03:22:55,530 --> 03:22:55,930
But why?

4330
03:22:56,110 --> 03:22:58,510
Only a few people know about your presence here.

4331
03:22:58,770 --> 03:23:00,210
But why can't they know?

4332
03:23:00,210 --> 03:23:01,070
There's no need for concern.

4333
03:23:01,530 --> 03:23:04,170
This operation is under Pentagon's direct command.

4334
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:04,590
They might shoot me.

4335
03:23:04,690 --> 03:23:07,270
And the NSDD came from the Vice President.

4336
03:23:07,270 --> 03:23:08,950
We could work together.

4337
03:23:09,270 --> 03:23:13,050
Your mission may be top secret, but it's gone through the usual channels.

4338
03:23:13,570 --> 03:23:14,090
Okay.

4339
03:23:20,700 --> 03:23:22,280
You work on the cringe.

4340
03:23:22,500 --> 03:23:23,440
I mean, fringe.

4341
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:26,420
Oh my god, the music.

4342
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:30,640
Nothing new.

4343
03:23:36,020 --> 03:23:36,160
Oh!

4344
03:23:37,820 --> 03:23:38,940
I'll go check the roof.

4345
03:23:39,060 --> 03:23:40,960
I'll leave the first floor to you, okay?

4346
03:23:41,260 --> 03:23:41,740
Okay.

4347
03:23:46,260 --> 03:23:47,680
Bye, Gorlukovich soldier.

4348
03:23:50,320 --> 03:23:51,660
Okay, show off.

4349
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:53,540
Okay, Raiden.

4350
03:23:54,480 --> 03:23:55,340
There's the nerd.

4351
03:24:02,080 --> 03:24:05,680
Colonel, I've located the node, but it's under heavy surveillance.

4352
03:24:05,980 --> 03:24:07,620
I can't get in any closer.

4353
03:24:07,620 --> 03:24:08,320
You have to.

4354
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:09,020
Distract them.

4355
03:24:09,020 --> 03:24:11,940
Try making some noise to draw their attention away.

4356
03:24:12,020 --> 03:24:12,540
Scary.

4357
03:24:12,740 --> 03:24:12,960
How?

4358
03:24:13,900 --> 03:24:17,020
Flatten yourself against a wall and hit the punch button.

4359
03:24:17,720 --> 03:24:18,560
Got it.

4360
03:24:18,580 --> 03:24:19,260
Got it.

4361
03:24:19,770 --> 03:24:21,680
I'm gonna flatten myself against the wall.

4362
03:24:22,120 --> 03:24:23,500
Before I do that...

4363
03:24:25,790 --> 03:24:26,480
Anything in here?

4364
03:24:26,900 --> 03:24:27,660
Like a... oh.

4365
03:24:28,240 --> 03:24:28,980
Dang it.

4366
03:24:29,360 --> 03:24:31,080
Oh, I need the SOCOM first.

4367
03:24:32,860 --> 03:24:33,400
Oh.

4368
03:24:33,860 --> 03:24:34,400
Uh...

4369
03:24:35,220 --> 03:24:35,760
Okay.

4370
03:24:44,130 --> 03:24:44,630
Oh my god, scary.

4371
03:24:49,990 --> 03:24:51,170
What if I didn't do that?

4372
03:24:51,270 --> 03:24:52,010
What if I just ran?

4373
03:24:52,210 --> 03:24:52,670
Oh my god.

4374
03:24:54,490 --> 03:24:55,070
Uh, hello?

4375
03:24:55,330 --> 03:24:55,810
Do it!

4376
03:25:03,350 --> 03:25:04,070
Yes, exit.

4377
03:25:09,960 --> 03:25:10,620
What's this way?

4378
03:25:14,360 --> 03:25:14,900
Is this the way?

4379
03:25:14,900 --> 03:25:15,640
Punch the nerd.

4380
03:25:17,460 --> 03:25:19,100
We need to get to...

4381
03:25:19,510 --> 03:25:20,040
Oh my god.

4382
03:25:20,060 --> 03:25:21,500
I can already hear the ciphers.

4383
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:29,180
R2-D2.

4384
03:25:31,400 --> 03:25:31,940
Ring.

4385
03:25:35,620 --> 03:25:36,600
Yes, colonel?

4386
03:25:36,700 --> 03:25:37,400
Watch your back.

4387
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:38,600
That's a cipher.

4388
03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:39,870
A type of UAV.

4389
03:25:43,510 --> 03:25:47,630
Why is he green?

4390
03:25:49,720 --> 03:25:50,210
Nice.

4391
03:25:51,780 --> 03:25:55,530
Um, Colonel, where... do I get a gun?

4392
03:25:58,150 --> 03:25:59,130
Okay.

4393
03:26:02,750 --> 03:26:03,490
Copy that.

4394
03:26:05,540 --> 03:26:06,030
Oh!

4395
03:26:09,950 --> 03:26:11,350
Yeah.

4396
03:26:17,970 --> 03:26:21,070
Okay, what's going on?

4397
03:26:22,710 --> 03:26:23,810
Oh!

4398
03:26:24,010 --> 03:26:28,590
What about his package?

4399
03:26:29,510 --> 03:26:30,210
Ooh!

4400
03:26:31,690 --> 03:26:35,390
Come on home.

4401
03:26:37,670 --> 03:26:38,610
Oh no!

4402
03:26:39,870 --> 03:26:40,470
Mr. President!

4403
03:26:40,890 --> 03:26:41,910
Mr. President!

4404
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:45,330
Huh?

4405
03:26:48,330 --> 03:26:49,310
What could it be?

4406
03:26:51,050 --> 03:26:51,650
Uh oh.

4407
03:26:52,290 --> 03:26:53,130
Oh my god!

4408
03:26:53,610 --> 03:26:54,230
Oh my god!

4409
03:26:54,230 --> 03:26:54,510
Oh my god!

4410
03:26:54,550 --> 03:26:54,730
Oh my god!

4411
03:26:55,630 --> 03:26:57,190
We gotta go to Strut B!

4412
03:26:57,430 --> 03:26:57,890
Now!

4413
03:26:59,390 --> 03:27:00,950
But this doesn't go to Strut B.

4414
03:27:01,890 --> 03:27:03,310
This goes to F.

4415
03:27:03,390 --> 03:27:05,210
This is F.

4416
03:27:06,110 --> 03:27:06,750
My bad.

4417
03:27:07,850 --> 03:27:08,670
On our way back.

4418
03:27:09,210 --> 03:27:09,510
Damn.

4419
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:22,020
Oh my god!

4420
03:27:22,060 --> 03:27:22,540
Oh my god!

4421
03:27:22,580 --> 03:27:22,660
Oh my god!

4422
03:27:22,660 --> 03:27:23,400
I knew that was gonna happen.

4423
03:27:23,740 --> 03:27:24,620
Oh my god!

4424
03:27:27,180 --> 03:27:28,360
Scared the heck out of me.

4425
03:27:28,460 --> 03:27:28,780
Please.

4426
03:27:31,660 --> 03:27:33,540
Oh my god.

4427
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:39,090
What do you mean, hmm?

4428
03:27:40,090 --> 03:27:40,450
Um...

4429
03:27:41,850 --> 03:27:43,110
Get me out of here, please.

4430
03:27:43,210 --> 03:27:43,490
No!

4431
03:27:43,650 --> 03:27:43,970
No!

4432
03:27:46,130 --> 03:27:47,390
Thanks for the five gifted.

4433
03:27:47,390 --> 03:27:48,310
Um...

4434
03:27:50,350 --> 03:27:51,070
Oh my god.

4435
03:28:00,990 --> 03:28:02,170
I could use...

4436
03:28:04,070 --> 03:28:05,710
I could use some help right now.

4437
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:07,430
I could use some help right now.

4438
03:28:17,630 --> 03:28:18,810
I don't even have a gun!

4439
03:28:19,310 --> 03:28:21,030
I don't even have a gun!

4440
03:28:21,030 --> 03:28:22,410
This damn guy noticing me.

4441
03:28:35,510 --> 03:28:36,950
Just gonna restart.

4442
03:28:37,270 --> 03:28:37,290
Just gonna restart.

4443
03:28:38,110 --> 03:28:38,590
Kill

4444
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:43,940
me.

4445
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:44,680
Just kill me already.

4446
03:28:44,960 --> 03:28:45,440
Please!

4447
03:28:45,480 --> 03:28:46,260
I thought he wasn't...

4448
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:57,620
Yeah, like it never even happened.

4449
03:28:58,480 --> 03:28:59,420
Don't even...

4450
03:29:00,420 --> 03:29:01,820
Don't even worry about it.

4451
03:29:01,860 --> 03:29:02,940
Great start, everybody.

4452
03:29:03,400 --> 03:29:04,160
Great start.

4453
03:29:06,260 --> 03:29:07,160
Great start.

4454
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:08,360
Great start.

4455
03:29:08,940 --> 03:29:11,260
Don't even count it.

4456
03:29:11,360 --> 03:29:12,560
It doesn't even count.

4457
03:29:12,900 --> 03:29:14,000
It doesn't even...

4458
03:29:15,320 --> 03:29:16,760
It doesn't even count.

4459
03:29:17,020 --> 03:29:18,960
It doesn't even count.

4460
03:29:19,180 --> 03:29:21,460
Just don't even think that this happened.

4461
03:29:21,740 --> 03:29:21,860
Okay?

4462
03:29:23,220 --> 03:29:26,100
This is the gameplay I subscribed for.

4463
03:29:37,110 --> 03:29:38,810
Jack, do you need to save?

4464
03:29:39,490 --> 03:29:39,990
Yeah.

4465
03:29:42,870 --> 03:29:44,330
Great practice run, boss.

4466
03:29:44,350 --> 03:29:44,950
Thank you.

4467
03:29:46,030 --> 03:29:47,830
Yeah, just a practice run.

4468
03:29:48,690 --> 03:29:49,250
Yeah.

4469
03:29:56,330 --> 03:29:56,890
Saving.

4470
03:29:58,550 --> 03:29:59,850
Rose, are you okay?

4471
03:30:00,130 --> 03:30:01,030
Yes, thank you.

4472
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:04,310
It really scared me at first, but I think I've gotten used to it.

4473
03:30:04,570 --> 03:30:06,570
I'll be behind you all the way, so don't worry.

4474
03:30:06,890 --> 03:30:08,770
I guess women really are strong.

4475
03:30:09,530 --> 03:30:10,230
Not quite.

4476
03:30:10,590 --> 03:30:12,030
It's not women that are strong.

4477
03:30:12,150 --> 03:30:12,690
It's me.

4478
03:30:12,930 --> 03:30:14,750
Just as long as I can count on you.

4479
03:30:15,350 --> 03:30:16,650
Actually, that's not true.

4480
03:30:16,850 --> 03:30:18,470
It still scares me to death.

4481
03:30:18,670 --> 03:30:19,610
But I'll be strong.

4482
03:30:20,050 --> 03:30:20,690
I'll try.

4483
03:30:21,130 --> 03:30:21,730
For you.

4484
03:30:22,470 --> 03:30:23,050
Good luck.

4485
03:30:24,190 --> 03:30:25,250
What's up with this guy?

4486
03:30:25,550 --> 03:30:27,330
Get a load of this, bozo.

4487
03:30:32,970 --> 03:30:34,050
I have my thermal.

4488
03:30:34,190 --> 03:30:35,190
My sensor.

4489
03:30:36,550 --> 03:30:37,890
Yeah, I have a chaff grenade.

4490
03:30:38,010 --> 03:30:39,470
Maybe I do need to go through there.

4491
03:30:39,690 --> 03:30:40,190
Oh, wait.

4492
03:30:43,230 --> 03:30:45,050
Yeah, maybe I do need to go through there.

4493
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:45,650
And I don't remember.

4494
03:30:48,980 --> 03:30:50,120
No, no, no, sir.

4495
03:30:50,300 --> 03:30:52,280
No, no, I'm not making the same mistake again.

4496
03:30:54,980 --> 03:30:55,500
You can.

4497
03:31:00,900 --> 03:31:02,480
Or do I go to the other side?

4498
03:31:03,960 --> 03:31:05,480
Do I go to that side over there?

4499
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:06,040
Do I go to that side over there?

4500
03:31:06,040 --> 03:31:06,620
I can't remember.

4501
03:31:08,320 --> 03:31:09,600
Rose is built differently.

4502
03:31:09,900 --> 03:31:10,280
She is.

4503
03:31:12,300 --> 03:31:13,740
It is the left side, isn't it?

4504
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:14,020
Yeah.

4505
03:31:23,880 --> 03:31:24,280
Here!

4506
03:31:29,560 --> 03:31:30,260
A, B!

4507
03:31:30,420 --> 03:31:31,160
There we go.

4508
03:31:31,340 --> 03:31:31,880
A, B.

4509
03:31:32,880 --> 03:31:34,320
It's like it's not A, F.

4510
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:42,200
Strat F has the M9.

4511
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:44,420
I need a weapon.

4512
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:46,960
I need a weapon!

4513
03:31:51,450 --> 03:31:52,910
Why is everything OSP?

4514
03:31:58,670 --> 03:32:02,430
Then what do I do?

4515
03:32:05,190 --> 03:32:05,670
Hanging?

4516
03:32:06,110 --> 03:32:06,490
Hanging?

4517
03:32:07,110 --> 03:32:13,190
Face any waist-high railing and push the action button to clear the railing and hang over the side.

4518
03:32:13,790 --> 03:32:18,010
Once there, you can move sideways while keeping out of enemy sight.

4519
03:32:18,750 --> 03:32:19,350
Wow.

4520
03:32:19,450 --> 03:32:20,810
I'm giving it a try.

4521
03:32:21,130 --> 03:32:23,010
Don't forget the grip gauge.

4522
03:32:23,130 --> 03:32:25,950
It will keep decreasing during a hanging maneuver.

4523
03:32:25,970 --> 03:32:28,750
They're really giving him a lot of credit.

4524
03:32:28,910 --> 03:32:29,230
Look!

4525
03:32:30,530 --> 03:32:32,050
They're giving him so much credit.

4526
03:32:32,050 --> 03:32:33,470
They're just like, yeah, you got this.

4527
03:32:33,750 --> 03:32:36,170
You can hang for that long.

4528
03:32:36,250 --> 03:32:36,890
I believe in you.

4529
03:32:37,150 --> 03:32:38,230
I know you can do it.

4530
03:32:38,770 --> 03:32:39,690
Which side should I go?

4531
03:32:45,690 --> 03:32:47,030
There's the other guy on the other side.

4532
03:32:47,170 --> 03:32:47,530
Where'd he go?

4533
03:32:48,490 --> 03:32:49,490
Is this the one with downstairs?

4534
03:32:49,810 --> 03:32:50,250
Did he go downstairs?

4535
03:32:52,510 --> 03:32:53,650
Will he spot me?

4536
03:32:54,290 --> 03:32:56,430
If he's downstairs and I'm hanging over.

4537
03:32:59,530 --> 03:33:00,930
Time for level 2 grip.

4538
03:33:01,170 --> 03:33:02,130
Oh my god, there he is.

4539
03:33:02,870 --> 03:33:03,210
Yeah!

4540
03:33:04,750 --> 03:33:05,270
Yeah!

4541
03:33:06,470 --> 03:33:07,950
I wish I could shoot you.

4542
03:33:08,410 --> 03:33:11,350
I wish I could make you have a sweet, sweet nap.

4543
03:33:12,290 --> 03:33:16,330
A lifetime of peace and quiet.

4544
03:33:17,010 --> 03:33:17,830
Turn around!

4545
03:33:17,990 --> 03:33:18,410
Go away!

4546
03:33:19,930 --> 03:33:21,650
What are you just standing there for?

4547
03:33:22,250 --> 03:33:23,710
What are you daydreaming there?

4548
03:33:24,930 --> 03:33:25,450
Dummy!

4549
03:33:42,570 --> 03:33:43,970
That guy will turn around.

4550
03:33:46,390 --> 03:33:47,350
Definitely before...

4551
03:33:47,350 --> 03:33:48,150
Yeah, there we go.

4552
03:33:53,860 --> 03:33:55,220
Go, go, go, Raiden.

4553
03:33:55,320 --> 03:33:55,620
Go, go, go.

4554
03:33:56,420 --> 03:33:57,040
There we go.

4555
03:33:59,340 --> 03:34:00,600
To the president!

4556
03:34:04,490 --> 03:34:05,990
Raiden is so saucy.

4557
03:34:05,990 --> 03:34:06,590
I know, right?

4558
03:34:12,960 --> 03:34:13,760
Oh my god.

4559
03:34:23,060 --> 03:34:23,540
Colonel?

4560
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:24,540
Colonel?

4561
03:34:25,640 --> 03:34:26,180
It's too quiet.

4562
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:30,500
Raiden, the president should be somewhere in Strut B, where you are now.

4563
03:34:30,680 --> 03:34:30,860
Okay.

4564
03:34:31,020 --> 03:34:32,340
His life is in danger.

4565
03:34:32,520 --> 03:34:33,020
Hurry.

4566
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:33,620
Right.

4567
03:34:38,180 --> 03:34:40,600
I think my life is in danger, Colonel.

4568
03:34:43,580 --> 03:34:44,420
It's quiet.

4569
03:34:50,230 --> 03:34:50,730
Colonel?

4570
03:34:51,670 --> 03:34:54,310
Colonel, it's really spooky here.

4571
03:34:55,710 --> 03:34:57,130
Reminds me of MGS1.

4572
03:34:57,270 --> 03:34:57,590
I know.

4573
03:35:00,570 --> 03:35:03,490
It looked like I gasped for Raiden.

4574
03:35:07,520 --> 03:35:08,660
Uh-oh.

4575
03:35:09,680 --> 03:35:11,000
Uh-oh.

4576
03:35:12,020 --> 03:35:13,280
Uh-oh.

4577
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:14,680
Uh-oh.

4578
03:35:18,880 --> 03:35:20,660
It's kind of spooky here.

4579
03:35:22,660 --> 03:35:23,840
Those hips.

4580
03:35:23,960 --> 03:35:24,700
I know, man.

4581
03:35:27,800 --> 03:35:28,580
Grabbable.

4582
03:35:31,420 --> 03:35:32,260
Don't get caught.

4583
03:35:32,360 --> 03:35:33,260
Don't get caught, Raiden.

4584
03:35:33,460 --> 03:35:35,020
They're gonna do the job, these guys.

4585
03:35:35,200 --> 03:35:35,980
Let them handle it.

4586
03:35:36,220 --> 03:35:37,180
They won't get killed.

4587
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:38,260
They're better than the other guys.

4588
03:35:44,240 --> 03:35:45,540
I can't hit him.

4589
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:47,720
They're

4590
03:35:54,750 --> 03:35:56,030
not weak.

4591
03:35:56,110 --> 03:35:56,970
They won't give in.

4592
03:35:57,810 --> 03:35:59,650
This guy, he's the chosen one.

4593
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:00,710
He's the main character.

4594
03:36:01,510 --> 03:36:02,190
He'll live.

4595
03:36:03,490 --> 03:36:03,930
Ugh.

4596
03:36:04,990 --> 03:36:05,430
Ugh.

4597
03:36:15,670 --> 03:36:16,930
Just shoot.

4598
03:36:17,110 --> 03:36:17,850
Just shoot.

4599
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:23,370
Just shoot him!

4600
03:36:24,010 --> 03:36:25,770
It's Morb in time.

4601
03:36:26,020 --> 03:36:26,490
Morbius!

4602
03:36:29,050 --> 03:36:29,990
Ballet.

4603
03:36:31,610 --> 03:36:32,550
No!

4604
03:36:42,720 --> 03:36:43,820
That's gross.

4605
03:36:45,980 --> 03:36:46,820
Oh my god.

4606
03:36:47,300 --> 03:36:49,200
Okay, we're really playing it up now, huh?

4607
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:50,560
Okay, it's just a fountain.

4608
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:51,420
My goodness.

4609
03:36:51,700 --> 03:36:52,080
Please.

4610
03:36:53,540 --> 03:36:55,720
Just fall already.

4611
03:37:01,300 --> 03:37:03,220
Are you sure this is Alpha?

4612
03:37:05,060 --> 03:37:09,360
I think you instead sent in the baby squad.

4613
03:37:11,700 --> 03:37:12,540
Alpha where?

4614
03:37:16,420 --> 03:37:16,900
Right.

4615
03:37:16,900 --> 03:37:17,560
Ryden, be careful.

4616
03:37:17,660 --> 03:37:18,460
I'm scared for you.

4617
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:21,180
He's gonna come after your body.

4618
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:26,070
Oh.

4619
03:37:27,250 --> 03:37:27,990
What's happening?

4620
03:37:28,330 --> 03:37:29,270
Ew, there's bugs!

4621
03:37:29,470 --> 03:37:30,410
Oh, sorry, those are bullets.

4622
03:37:30,430 --> 03:37:30,730
Never mind.

4623
03:37:36,030 --> 03:37:37,230
Oh my god!

4624
03:37:41,420 --> 03:37:43,340
Oh my god, he's twitching.

4625
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:45,360
I think he's enjoying it.

4626
03:37:47,540 --> 03:37:48,480
Get sucked.

4627
03:37:49,200 --> 03:37:49,680
Oh!

4628
03:37:50,740 --> 03:37:51,240
What is he doing?

4629
03:37:52,920 --> 03:37:54,260
Oh my god, he's a vampire!

4630
03:37:56,220 --> 03:37:58,400
Here, he's gonna do something really freaky, I bet.

4631
03:37:58,740 --> 03:37:59,320
What are you?

4632
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:03,600
He's gonna do something really freaky here, I bet.

4633
03:38:07,040 --> 03:38:09,060
Oh my god.

4634
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:10,420
What a freak!

4635
03:38:10,500 --> 03:38:11,240
Five today.

4636
03:38:11,240 --> 03:38:12,800
Five today.

4637
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:16,060
Or rather, six.

4638
03:38:17,380 --> 03:38:19,040
Whoa, vamp!

4639
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:20,300
He really is a vampire!

4640
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:23,580
Look at that smirk.

4641
03:38:25,460 --> 03:38:27,140
No sferatu!

4642
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:32,680
Oh my god, Ryden, please!

4643
03:38:33,140 --> 03:38:33,540
Get down!

4644
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:33,660
Ooh!

4645
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:36,860
Oh.

4646
03:38:38,570 --> 03:38:41,970
Get my team!

4647
03:38:42,870 --> 03:38:43,390
Oh!

4648
03:38:46,470 --> 03:38:48,770
What beautiful eyes, this soldier has.

4649
03:38:59,030 --> 03:38:59,950
Where is he?

4650
03:39:00,130 --> 03:39:00,370
Oh!

4651
03:39:04,010 --> 03:39:04,910
I don't know.

4652
03:39:06,590 --> 03:39:07,110
Probably...

4653
03:39:07,110 --> 03:39:09,790
Wow, this soldier even has such a nice butt.

4654
03:39:10,530 --> 03:39:12,870
Does everybody in this series have a nice butt!?

4655
03:39:12,870 --> 03:39:13,310
Oh my god!

4656
03:39:26,850 --> 03:39:28,050
Ooh la la.

4657
03:39:31,470 --> 03:39:33,210
There's smell like a barker.

4658
03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:34,990
Eren Yeager.

4659
03:39:38,050 --> 03:39:39,630
It's a barker.

4660
03:39:41,430 --> 03:39:43,310
It has to be one.

4661
03:39:43,490 --> 03:39:44,010
Yeah!

4662
03:39:44,010 --> 03:39:44,590
What are you waiting for?

4663
03:39:50,890 --> 03:39:53,890
Yeah, I know how to do the hanging the grip strength.

4664
03:39:53,890 --> 03:39:54,530
Don't worry.

4665
03:39:58,470 --> 03:40:00,150
Yes, queen.

4666
03:40:05,630 --> 03:40:06,890
Central unit.

4667
03:40:11,610 --> 03:40:13,790
You're too slow, Raiden.

4668
03:40:13,970 --> 03:40:14,610
You're too slow.

4669
03:40:18,450 --> 03:40:20,250
Vamp is so OP.

4670
03:40:24,630 --> 03:40:26,410
It's kind of unfair.

4671
03:40:27,510 --> 03:40:28,330
Hold on.

4672
03:40:28,550 --> 03:40:29,450
I'm not an enemy.

4673
03:40:29,630 --> 03:40:30,170
Calm down.

4674
03:40:36,200 --> 03:40:37,280
My name is...

4675
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:40,080
My name is Plissken.

4676
03:40:40,240 --> 03:40:42,240
My name is Slim Shady.

4677
03:40:42,400 --> 03:40:43,240
That's what he almost said.

4678
03:40:43,620 --> 03:40:45,100
He was quoting the song.

4679
03:40:45,380 --> 03:40:47,440
My name is Slim Shady.

4680
03:40:57,010 --> 03:40:58,510
How did you get in?

4681
03:40:58,730 --> 03:41:00,750
Fast rope descent from a navy chopper.

4682
03:41:03,330 --> 03:41:03,930
Eww!

4683
03:41:04,550 --> 03:41:05,150
Wait.

4684
03:41:05,290 --> 03:41:06,570
We saw those bugs before.

4685
03:41:06,610 --> 03:41:07,310
Have I seen you before?

4686
03:41:09,890 --> 03:41:12,570
Stop staring at his crotch, Plissken!

4687
03:41:12,910 --> 03:41:13,690
Are you Foxhound?

4688
03:41:16,470 --> 03:41:17,250
That's right.

4689
03:41:17,550 --> 03:41:18,110
That's right.

4690
03:41:18,570 --> 03:41:19,930
Foxhound was disbanded.

4691
03:41:21,470 --> 03:41:23,870
Where were you before Foxhound?

4692
03:41:23,950 --> 03:41:24,530
Delta Force?

4693
03:41:25,510 --> 03:41:26,490
Oh my god.

4694
03:41:26,670 --> 03:41:28,050
Plissken is so handsome.

4695
03:41:28,050 --> 03:41:31,430
I was part of the army's Force 21 trials.

4696
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:32,750
Force 21?

4697
03:41:33,210 --> 03:41:35,290
That's about tactical IT deployment, right?

4698
03:41:36,970 --> 03:41:37,470
Wow!

4699
03:41:37,630 --> 03:41:38,150
Real people!

4700
03:41:38,930 --> 03:41:39,890
That was me.

4701
03:41:39,990 --> 03:41:40,350
Not really.

4702
03:41:40,750 --> 03:41:41,950
So this is your first.

4703
03:41:42,170 --> 03:41:42,470
That's me!

4704
03:41:42,590 --> 03:41:43,790
I've had extensive training.

4705
03:41:43,970 --> 03:41:46,510
The kind that's indistinguishable from the real thing.

4706
03:41:46,770 --> 03:41:47,430
Like what?

4707
03:41:48,250 --> 03:41:49,150
Video game.

4708
03:41:49,430 --> 03:41:49,930
Sneaky mission 60.

4709
03:41:50,930 --> 03:41:51,810
Weapons 80.

4710
03:41:53,070 --> 03:41:54,550
Advanced VR, huh?

4711
03:41:54,590 --> 03:41:55,130
Advanced?

4712
03:41:55,170 --> 03:41:56,390
But realistic in every way.

4713
03:41:56,390 --> 03:41:57,950
Uh, no, no, sir.

4714
03:41:58,110 --> 03:41:59,550
A virtual grunt of the digital age.

4715
03:41:59,630 --> 03:42:00,310
That's just great.

4716
03:42:00,610 --> 03:42:01,730
I play video game.

4717
03:42:01,770 --> 03:42:03,330
That's far more effective than live exercises.

4718
03:42:03,850 --> 03:42:04,290
Nah.

4719
03:42:04,290 --> 03:42:05,790
You don't get injured in VR, do you?

4720
03:42:06,750 --> 03:42:07,070
No, no, no.

4721
03:42:07,070 --> 03:42:09,330
Every year, a few soldiers die in field exercises.

4722
03:42:09,330 --> 03:42:09,910
Oh my god, VR missions!

4723
03:42:10,490 --> 03:42:13,950
There's pain sensation in VR and even a sense of reality and urgency.

4724
03:42:14,210 --> 03:42:16,130
The only difference is it isn't actually happening.

4725
03:42:16,130 --> 03:42:16,310
Oh my god, it's Nick!

4726
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:16,870
You're getting injured!

4727
03:42:17,290 --> 03:42:17,930
That's the way they want you to think.

4728
03:42:17,930 --> 03:42:20,330
To remove you from the fear that goes with battle situations.

4729
03:42:21,250 --> 03:42:22,690
War is a video game.

4730
03:42:22,950 --> 03:42:24,990
What better way to raise the ultimate soldier?

4731
03:42:31,690 --> 03:42:33,590
No, I think I should hold on to that.

4732
03:42:33,750 --> 03:42:34,710
I don't write in VR.

4733
03:42:34,710 --> 03:42:37,170
So you're saying that VR training is some kind of mind control?

4734
03:42:39,730 --> 03:42:42,470
Oh, what a funny time for Colonel to call.

4735
03:42:42,650 --> 03:42:44,690
The Alpha team from Navy SEAL 10 is dead.

4736
03:42:44,870 --> 03:42:46,210
No, a single survivor.

4737
03:42:46,630 --> 03:42:48,670
The kid's wired with nanomachines.

4738
03:42:54,210 --> 03:42:55,670
What about the President?

4739
03:42:55,990 --> 03:42:57,830
Looks like they took him somewhere else.

4740
03:42:58,110 --> 03:42:58,810
I see.

4741
03:42:59,470 --> 03:43:00,710
You said there was a zombie.

4742
03:43:00,710 --> 03:43:02,270
A survivor from SEAL Team 10.

4743
03:43:02,610 --> 03:43:03,170
Whatever.

4744
03:43:03,450 --> 03:43:05,110
Lieutenant J.G.

4745
03:43:05,210 --> 03:43:05,770
Plissken.

4746
03:43:05,970 --> 03:43:07,370
Has he seen your face?

4747
03:43:07,370 --> 03:43:08,030
J.G.

4748
03:43:08,290 --> 03:43:08,850
Plissken.

4749
03:43:08,870 --> 03:43:10,610
This is a top secret mission.

4750
03:43:10,970 --> 03:43:12,970
No one can know that we're involved.

4751
03:43:13,350 --> 03:43:13,650
Whatever.

4752
03:43:13,650 --> 03:43:14,890
It's a little too late for that.

4753
03:43:17,970 --> 03:43:19,950
A little too late for that.

4754
03:43:20,270 --> 03:43:20,830
Take a look.

4755
03:43:23,210 --> 03:43:24,110
What is it?

4756
03:43:24,690 --> 03:43:25,250
Oh!

4757
03:43:28,790 --> 03:43:29,750
Oh my god.

4758
03:43:30,990 --> 03:43:32,010
What the hell?

4759
03:43:32,730 --> 03:43:34,090
A Navy Captain.

4760
03:43:40,690 --> 03:43:41,210
Ow!

4761
03:43:42,350 --> 03:43:42,870
Plissken!

4762
03:43:44,150 --> 03:43:44,910
You alright?

4763
03:43:45,290 --> 03:43:46,330
Plissken, are you okay?

4764
03:43:46,710 --> 03:43:47,730
Give me a few minutes.

4765
03:43:47,930 --> 03:43:50,150
It's my... It's my Twitter header.

4766
03:43:50,410 --> 03:43:51,990
Must have lost a few more pints than I thought.

4767
03:43:53,650 --> 03:43:56,310
I want you to know your old chocolate mint cover is a banger.

4768
03:43:56,510 --> 03:43:57,570
Ned, thank you!

4769
03:43:57,950 --> 03:43:59,410
That blood-sucking freak.

4770
03:43:59,850 --> 03:44:00,190
Nah.

4771
03:44:01,150 --> 03:44:02,110
That was vamp.

4772
03:44:02,650 --> 03:44:03,190
Vamp.

4773
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:06,210
He's Romanian.

4774
03:44:06,690 --> 03:44:08,130
A wizard with knives, as you saw.

4775
03:44:08,130 --> 03:44:08,530
He's a wizard!

4776
03:44:08,850 --> 03:44:10,630
The way he moved didn't seem human.

4777
03:44:10,810 --> 03:44:12,690
You won't see that in VR, I guarantee.

4778
03:44:13,130 --> 03:44:14,070
What is he?

4779
03:44:14,210 --> 03:44:15,990
One of the members of Dead Cell.

4780
03:44:16,270 --> 03:44:16,550
Yeah!

4781
03:44:16,650 --> 03:44:17,030
Dead Cell.

4782
03:44:17,190 --> 03:44:17,610
Him?

4783
03:44:17,850 --> 03:44:21,630
A special forces unit created by ex-president George Sears.

4784
03:44:21,810 --> 03:44:25,230
The name was originally intended to reflect its anti-terrorist functions.

4785
03:44:25,290 --> 03:44:26,390
All my favorite people.

4786
03:44:26,470 --> 03:44:30,570
The unit would launch unannounced assaults on government complexes for the ultimate terrorism simulation.

4787
03:44:31,110 --> 03:44:32,630
They were needed to show VR and video games.

4788
03:44:32,630 --> 03:44:34,810
I don't know how many of our troopers like you know how to deal with the real thing.

4789
03:44:35,150 --> 03:44:39,070
But around the time their original leader died in prison, the unit began to unravel.

4790
03:44:39,530 --> 03:44:40,150
George Sears.

4791
03:44:40,210 --> 03:44:41,430
They were always close to the edge.

4792
03:44:41,510 --> 03:44:43,190
But they became more and more extreme.

4793
03:44:43,530 --> 03:44:44,790
Began to go after U.S.

4794
03:44:44,830 --> 03:44:46,130
allies, even civilians.

4795
03:44:46,530 --> 03:44:52,250
He has made that no fewer than a hundred people died as a result of accidents the Dead Cell arranged on their own.

4796
03:44:52,430 --> 03:44:55,890
They were out of control, and it all came to a head six months ago.

4797
03:44:56,050 --> 03:44:57,150
They fixed George.

4798
03:44:57,330 --> 03:44:57,770
Yeah!

4799
03:44:57,770 --> 03:44:58,950
The unit was devastated.

4800
03:44:59,290 --> 03:45:02,030
There are only three left now, and you just saw one of them.

4801
03:45:02,130 --> 03:45:02,410
Uh-oh.

4802
03:45:02,410 --> 03:45:02,610
Why would you do that?

4803
03:45:02,610 --> 03:45:03,890
Why would they go after the Big Shell?

4804
03:45:04,290 --> 03:45:05,090
How should I know?

4805
03:45:05,310 --> 03:45:07,230
I told you they were on the Lunatic Fringe.

4806
03:45:07,330 --> 03:45:08,350
What about their leader?

4807
03:45:08,530 --> 03:45:09,810
He says he's Solid Snake.

4808
03:45:10,070 --> 03:45:10,150
Oh.

4809
03:45:10,490 --> 03:45:11,910
Snake died two years ago.

4810
03:45:12,250 --> 03:45:12,350
No!

4811
03:45:12,690 --> 03:45:13,170
Snake!

4812
03:45:13,930 --> 03:45:17,670
You mean the incident that made this Big Shell necessary in the first place?

4813
03:45:17,910 --> 03:45:18,270
Right.

4814
03:45:18,450 --> 03:45:20,670
And he was the one that sank that tanker.

4815
03:45:20,790 --> 03:45:21,870
But he's a legend.

4816
03:45:22,870 --> 03:45:23,430
He's a legend?

4817
03:45:23,430 --> 03:45:24,750
Legends are usually bad news.

4818
03:45:25,090 --> 03:45:27,510
There's not a lot of difference between heroes and madmen.

4819
03:45:28,390 --> 03:45:28,930
Wow, Plissken.

4820
03:45:28,930 --> 03:45:31,270
You're saying Snake is still alive and pulled another one?

4821
03:45:31,470 --> 03:45:31,770
No.

4822
03:45:31,770 --> 03:45:32,570
You and Snake have something in common.

4823
03:45:32,610 --> 03:45:33,770
No, he's not involved in this one.

4824
03:45:33,830 --> 03:45:34,050
He's got a similar thought process.

4825
03:45:34,050 --> 03:45:36,170
His body was positively ID'd two years ago.

4826
03:45:36,270 --> 03:45:36,330
True.

4827
03:45:36,490 --> 03:45:37,850
Snake is definitely dead.

4828
03:45:38,070 --> 03:45:38,630
Solid Snake...

4829
03:45:38,630 --> 03:45:39,130
Snake is dead.

4830
03:45:39,290 --> 03:45:40,830
Solid Snake is definitely dead.

4831
03:45:40,990 --> 03:45:41,010
And buried.

4832
03:45:41,290 --> 03:45:42,050
And buried.

4833
03:45:44,230 --> 03:45:44,750
No!

4834
03:45:44,750 --> 03:45:45,670
What about the other soldiers?

4835
03:45:46,230 --> 03:45:48,090
I saw Russian equipment, too.

4836
03:45:49,090 --> 03:45:50,450
Former Soviet military.

4837
03:45:50,890 --> 03:45:52,090
They're probably mercenaries.

4838
03:45:54,870 --> 03:45:58,850
The Big Shell is too much ground for just dead cell members to hold down.

4839
03:46:01,370 --> 03:46:02,190
Rip Snake.

4840
03:46:02,190 --> 03:46:02,450
Rip Snake.

4841
03:46:02,610 --> 03:46:03,470
You can't just leave him like that.

4842
03:46:03,530 --> 03:46:04,030
I know.

4843
03:46:04,190 --> 03:46:04,210
You're just not going to let him die.

4844
03:46:04,210 --> 03:46:05,250
You came in alone to boot?

4845
03:46:05,850 --> 03:46:06,370
Why?

4846
03:46:06,670 --> 03:46:07,070
Why?

4847
03:46:08,510 --> 03:46:10,290
What are you really doing here?

4848
03:46:10,550 --> 03:46:12,190
I got...

4849
03:46:12,190 --> 03:46:13,110
He's got to save the president.

4850
03:46:13,490 --> 03:46:14,570
Can't tell me, huh?

4851
03:46:14,830 --> 03:46:15,830
Fine with me.

4852
03:46:19,130 --> 03:46:20,190
I don't smoke.

4853
03:46:20,830 --> 03:46:21,770
Keep it anyway.

4854
03:46:22,090 --> 03:46:23,110
May come in handy.

4855
03:46:23,330 --> 03:46:23,570
Ooh!

4856
03:46:23,750 --> 03:46:25,070
Like a little snack.

4857
03:46:29,470 --> 03:46:30,490
Take this too.

4858
03:46:30,910 --> 03:46:31,430
Yay!

4859
03:46:32,130 --> 03:46:33,490
Plissken, you're so kind!

4860
03:46:33,830 --> 03:46:34,350
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were going to do that.

4861
03:46:34,370 --> 03:46:35,630
Do you have a suppressor, too?

4862
03:46:35,910 --> 03:46:36,370
I mean...

4863
03:46:37,650 --> 03:46:38,090
What?

4864
03:46:41,210 --> 03:46:46,310
I'm not really good at stealth games.

4865
03:46:46,990 --> 03:46:48,770
Sometimes it's kind of frustrating to even have that thing.

4866
03:46:49,090 --> 03:46:51,050
Do you have any spoiler-free tips to get good?

4867
03:46:52,670 --> 03:46:53,550
Pep Man?

4868
03:46:55,330 --> 03:46:56,450
I'm not good either.

4869
03:46:59,850 --> 03:47:01,750
I don't think you need to answer them.

4870
03:47:04,370 --> 03:47:05,930
The BC connecting bridge.

4871
03:47:08,670 --> 03:47:09,970
We need to get there.

4872
03:47:10,110 --> 03:47:10,990
Can you handle it?

4873
03:47:11,110 --> 03:47:12,450
I need a few more minutes.

4874
03:47:13,210 --> 03:47:13,690
No!

4875
03:47:14,450 --> 03:47:15,550
Remember my frequency.

4876
03:47:16,490 --> 03:47:18,230
It's 141.80.

4877
03:47:18,690 --> 03:47:19,650
141.80.

4878
03:47:19,730 --> 03:47:20,950
141.80.

4879
03:47:21,210 --> 03:47:21,670
Got it!

4880
03:47:22,010 --> 03:47:23,990
I've been briefed on this plant's layout.

4881
03:47:24,190 --> 03:47:27,610
If you need information on the place or about Dead Cell, contact me.

4882
03:47:27,750 --> 03:47:27,950
Okay!

4883
03:47:28,230 --> 03:47:29,870
You're using nano communication, right?

4884
03:47:30,290 --> 03:47:32,070
Yeah, but I can patch into your frequency.

4885
03:47:32,650 --> 03:47:33,890
Why you look so sussy?

4886
03:47:36,430 --> 03:47:37,870
141.80.

4887
03:47:38,230 --> 03:47:39,970
Hey, what's your name?

4888
03:47:45,630 --> 03:47:46,350
Raiden.

4889
03:47:46,650 --> 03:47:47,370
Raiden.

4890
03:47:47,650 --> 03:47:48,010
Raiden?

4891
03:47:48,590 --> 03:47:49,630
Strange code name.

4892
03:47:50,610 --> 03:47:52,910
Makes up for the boring one my parents gave me.

4893
03:47:53,910 --> 03:47:56,110
Maybe I'll find out someday.

4894
03:48:00,610 --> 03:48:02,490
This gets so cool!

4895
03:48:07,490 --> 03:48:09,330
He's so cool!

4896
03:48:10,070 --> 03:48:12,210
Why does Plissken look so familiar?

4897
03:48:12,470 --> 03:48:13,090
You think so?

4898
03:48:15,590 --> 03:48:17,830
He doesn't look all that familiar to me, eh?

4899
03:48:19,570 --> 03:48:21,910
Maybe we're mistaking him for like another character.

4900
03:48:22,710 --> 03:48:23,430
Oh, wait.

4901
03:48:24,010 --> 03:48:24,570
Wait.

4902
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:26,430
One...

4903
03:48:29,570 --> 03:48:30,690
141.80.

4904
03:48:30,690 --> 03:48:30,910
Zero.

4905
03:48:37,580 --> 03:48:38,840
He's asleep?

4906
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:42,100
Wake up, Plissken!

4907
03:48:42,400 --> 03:48:43,980
He just needed a little nap.

4908
03:48:45,980 --> 03:48:48,420
Oh, my baby!

4909
03:48:49,340 --> 03:48:50,380
My baby!

4910
03:48:50,480 --> 03:48:51,560
Look at him wake up!

4911
03:48:52,660 --> 03:48:54,660
Oh, he's just so cute!

4912
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:55,380
Oh, wait.

4913
03:48:57,300 --> 03:48:58,140
His

4914
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:03,300
sleeping face.

4915
03:49:09,590 --> 03:49:10,850
He's so cute!

4916
03:49:13,650 --> 03:49:15,810
I wish I had my camera!

4917
03:49:17,030 --> 03:49:18,030
Oh, my god!

4918
03:49:18,070 --> 03:49:19,050
I wish I had my camera!

4919
03:49:19,230 --> 03:49:19,890
Can I get closer?

4920
03:49:32,690 --> 03:49:34,390
Good morning, Plissken.

4921
03:49:37,670 --> 03:49:40,190
How much longer is this guy gonna sleep?

4922
03:49:42,090 --> 03:49:43,590
Good morning, Plissken.

4923
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:45,190
Good morning.

4924
03:49:47,010 --> 03:49:49,090
I wish I were that relaxed.

4925
03:49:49,350 --> 03:49:49,910
What?

4926
03:49:53,110 --> 03:49:53,710
Plissken?

4927
03:49:57,870 --> 03:49:59,410
He's still sleeping.

4928
03:49:59,710 --> 03:50:00,470
What did he just say?

4929
03:50:00,530 --> 03:50:00,750
Liquid.

4930
03:50:03,270 --> 03:50:12,100
Did he just say Meryl?

4931
03:50:12,200 --> 03:50:12,500
I feel like he's...

4932
03:50:13,100 --> 03:50:13,980
He's asleep?

4933
03:50:15,220 --> 03:50:17,140
Oh my god, his little baby face.

4934
03:50:17,500 --> 03:50:18,740
Oh gosh, I'm obsessed.

4935
03:50:19,480 --> 03:50:20,180
I'm obsessed!

4936
03:50:22,740 --> 03:50:23,600
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

4937
03:50:26,920 --> 03:50:27,860
Let's get out of here.

4938
03:50:29,160 --> 03:50:29,600
Yay!

4939
03:50:31,380 --> 03:50:34,640
Yeah, how does Plissken... Meryl's a common name, you guys.

4940
03:50:34,960 --> 03:50:36,940
It's probably like a different Meryl, you know?

4941
03:50:37,300 --> 03:50:39,660
It's probably like a really funny coink-a-dink, though.

4942
03:50:40,380 --> 03:50:41,020
You know?

4943
03:50:41,300 --> 03:50:42,240
It's pretty funny.

4944
03:50:43,660 --> 03:50:45,520
Pretty funny coink-a-dink, I'd say.

4945
03:50:45,740 --> 03:50:46,700
Oh, we gotta get the M9.

4946
03:50:46,820 --> 03:50:49,120
Didn't someone say that the M9 was on...

4947
03:50:51,740 --> 03:50:53,980
Was on a... oh, that's not a door.

4948
03:50:55,160 --> 03:50:58,020
The other... on F... the F area?

4949
03:51:01,220 --> 03:51:02,060
Did you hear that?

4950
03:51:03,740 --> 03:51:04,440
How funny.

4951
03:51:10,210 --> 03:51:10,950
We have one.

4952
03:51:11,310 --> 03:51:11,730
Gosh.

4953
03:51:14,070 --> 03:51:15,030
Statue of Liberty.

4954
03:51:16,290 --> 03:51:17,350
I love mint.

4955
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:18,670
Gaze it in!

4956
03:51:18,810 --> 03:51:19,910
Thank you for three months.

4957
03:51:20,950 --> 03:51:22,050
Can you shoot him?

4958
03:51:22,250 --> 03:51:24,350
Yeah, but... I don't wanna lose health.

4959
03:51:25,310 --> 03:51:26,570
He's gonna shoot me back!

4960
03:51:27,830 --> 03:51:28,930
You all know this.

4961
03:51:28,970 --> 03:51:32,150
You just wanna watch me get my butt wiped.

4962
03:51:34,670 --> 03:51:36,410
It is kinda worth it, though, isn't it?

4963
03:51:38,030 --> 03:51:38,650
Open up.

4964
03:51:40,730 --> 03:51:41,210
No!

4965
03:51:43,810 --> 03:51:44,710
Which one is this?

4966
03:51:44,910 --> 03:51:45,430
Oh, BC!

4967
03:51:45,750 --> 03:51:46,770
Is that where we need to go?

4968
03:51:48,150 --> 03:51:49,250
Where did it... wait, where...

4969
03:51:49,730 --> 03:51:50,610
Did you hear it?

4970
03:51:50,610 --> 03:51:50,850
You hear it?

4971
03:52:00,130 --> 03:52:00,490
Hmm...

4972
03:52:01,270 --> 03:52:02,130
I hear... oh!

4973
03:52:08,790 --> 03:52:12,670
I'm gonna go back and see if I can get the M9 if it's actually on the other...

4974
03:52:14,190 --> 03:52:15,430
Where you guys said it was.

4975
03:52:17,210 --> 03:52:21,150
The... uh... F... F... FF.

4976
03:52:21,830 --> 03:52:22,590
I'm sure it's nothing.

4977
03:52:22,730 --> 03:52:22,890
Yeah!

4978
03:52:23,190 --> 03:52:23,690
Str... F!

4979
03:52:23,690 --> 03:52:24,310
Yeah, yeah.

4980
03:52:26,030 --> 03:52:27,290
I'm sure it's nothing.

4981
03:52:29,410 --> 03:52:30,210
Nothing here.

4982
03:52:30,690 --> 03:52:31,330
I'm sure it's...

4983
03:52:34,470 --> 03:52:35,590
I'm sure it's nothing.

4984
03:52:36,590 --> 03:52:37,630
Are those guys still here?

4985
03:52:38,130 --> 03:52:39,130
They have to be, right?

4986
03:52:40,510 --> 03:52:40,910
Okay.

4987
03:52:44,070 --> 03:52:44,470
Whew!

4988
03:52:44,650 --> 03:52:45,170
That was close.

4989
03:52:46,930 --> 03:52:48,070
We'll level up eventually.

4990
03:52:48,430 --> 03:52:50,810
I might even do it off-stream, I'm not gonna lie.

4991
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:51,170
Oh, wait.

4992
03:52:51,250 --> 03:52:52,450
This is kinda bad, isn't it?

4993
03:52:52,750 --> 03:52:53,290
Uh-oh.

4994
03:52:54,030 --> 03:52:56,630
He's gonna turn around, and I'm not gonna have any grip left.

4995
03:52:57,290 --> 03:52:57,770
Wait!

4996
03:53:00,450 --> 03:53:00,930
Uh...

4997
03:53:03,290 --> 03:53:03,770
Uh...

4998
03:53:04,370 --> 03:53:05,490
Go, go, go, Raiden!

4999
03:53:05,530 --> 03:53:06,130
Go, go, go!

5000
03:53:12,720 --> 03:53:14,260
We got this!

5001
03:53:14,540 --> 03:53:15,660
We got...

5002
03:53:15,660 --> 03:53:17,680
Presidents' package can wait.

5003
03:53:18,340 --> 03:53:18,820
Yeah.

5004
03:53:22,680 --> 03:53:23,440
Oh my god.

5005
03:53:24,800 --> 03:53:26,800
That camera... That security camera scared me.

5006
03:53:30,760 --> 03:53:31,720
It was this one, right?

5007
03:53:33,240 --> 03:53:33,640
Oh.

5008
03:53:33,780 --> 03:53:34,740
Uh... I guess so.

5009
03:53:40,500 --> 03:53:43,480
Mint has to do the grip exercises all over again because it's a new character.

5010
03:53:43,620 --> 03:53:46,020
Uh... I was beginning to say I might do it off-stream.

5011
03:53:46,400 --> 03:53:48,260
Um... Just... Just cause, you know.

5012
03:54:00,950 --> 03:54:01,750
Get exploded.

5013
03:54:05,250 --> 03:54:06,350
Anything down here?

5014
03:54:06,770 --> 03:54:07,890
I see something.

5015
03:54:10,390 --> 03:54:11,350
Nice shot.

5016
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:11,970
Thank you!

5017
03:54:16,310 --> 03:54:18,510
I could do it here, actually.

5018
03:54:20,030 --> 03:54:21,430
I could do it right here.

5019
03:54:24,070 --> 03:54:25,170
Everybody ready?

5020
03:54:27,780 --> 03:54:28,410
A one.

5021
03:54:29,630 --> 03:54:30,510
A two.

5022
03:54:32,350 --> 03:54:32,970
Three!

5023
03:54:35,010 --> 03:54:35,690
Four!

5024
03:54:37,530 --> 03:54:38,230
Five!

5025
03:54:40,430 --> 03:54:41,130
Six!

5026
03:54:42,610 --> 03:54:43,930
Seven!

5027
03:54:47,370 --> 03:54:48,070
Eight!

5028
03:54:57,890 --> 03:54:59,290
Nine!

5029
03:55:01,250 --> 03:55:01,950
Ten!

5030
03:55:04,310 --> 03:55:05,010
Eleven!

5031
03:55:07,070 --> 03:55:07,770
Twelve!

5032
03:55:10,570 --> 03:55:11,390
Thirteen!

5033
03:55:11,390 --> 03:55:11,870
Thirteen!

5034
03:55:13,390 --> 03:55:14,290
Fourteen!

5035
03:55:14,710 --> 03:55:14,850
Fourteen!

5036
03:55:14,950 --> 03:55:16,370
I don't know if that counted.

5037
03:55:24,010 --> 03:55:24,910
Fifteen!

5038
03:55:26,850 --> 03:55:27,750
Sixteen!

5039
03:55:29,130 --> 03:55:30,030
Seventeen!

5040
03:55:32,130 --> 03:55:33,030
Eighteen!

5041
03:55:35,070 --> 03:55:35,520
Nineteen!

5042
03:55:37,080 --> 03:55:37,530
Twenty!

5043
03:55:37,530 --> 03:55:38,270
Twenty!

5044
03:55:39,830 --> 03:55:41,030
Twenty-one!

5045
03:55:46,910 --> 03:55:48,390
We're almost a quarter of the way.

5046
03:55:51,130 --> 03:55:52,130
Counting with Minto.

5047
03:55:54,350 --> 03:55:55,450
Twenty-two!

5048
03:55:56,310 --> 03:55:57,690
Wait, twenty-three?

5049
03:55:58,770 --> 03:56:00,270
I don't know if the... Twenty-four!

5050
03:56:01,870 --> 03:56:02,990
Twenty-five!

5051
03:56:03,330 --> 03:56:04,950
I don't know if the twenty-one counted.

5052
03:56:05,190 --> 03:56:06,130
Twenty-six!

5053
03:56:06,130 --> 03:56:06,370
Twenty-six!

5054
03:56:07,750 --> 03:56:08,950
Twenty-seven!

5055
03:56:10,490 --> 03:56:11,650
Twenty-eight!

5056
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:14,870
I don't know if the last ones count.

5057
03:56:18,490 --> 03:56:20,730
But I'm just gonna count it anyway.

5058
03:56:22,090 --> 03:56:23,310
Twenty-nine!

5059
03:56:24,890 --> 03:56:25,570
Thirty!

5060
03:56:27,190 --> 03:56:28,350
Thirty-one!

5061
03:56:29,970 --> 03:56:31,150
Thirty-two!

5062
03:56:31,210 --> 03:56:34,630
If you drop and quickly grab, it'll count as ten.

5063
03:56:34,690 --> 03:56:35,050
No way!

5064
03:56:35,050 --> 03:56:35,230
Really?

5065
03:56:35,430 --> 03:56:36,110
Okay.

5066
03:56:36,110 --> 03:56:37,490
Oh, drop.

5067
03:56:38,150 --> 03:56:38,690
Just kidding.

5068
03:56:41,030 --> 03:56:41,390
Oh!

5069
03:56:41,990 --> 03:56:43,070
Wait, how do I...

5070
03:56:43,070 --> 03:56:43,570
Okay, hold on.

5071
03:56:43,770 --> 03:56:44,390
Are you...

5072
03:56:44,390 --> 03:56:45,290
Are you pulling my leg?

5073
03:56:48,150 --> 03:56:49,330
I kind of want to test it, though.

5074
03:56:52,070 --> 03:56:53,170
How do you do it, though?

5075
03:56:55,610 --> 03:56:57,550
Oh, you need to catch onto a lower ledge.

5076
03:56:57,650 --> 03:56:57,890
Oh!

5077
03:56:58,710 --> 03:56:59,290
Okay, okay.

5078
03:56:59,430 --> 03:56:59,990
I was gonna say.

5079
03:57:00,230 --> 03:57:01,590
I don't think that's possible.

5080
03:57:02,230 --> 03:57:03,470
To catch it that quickly.

5081
03:57:03,470 --> 03:57:05,370
Needs to be ledges.

5082
03:57:05,930 --> 03:57:07,450
What number are we at?

5083
03:57:09,710 --> 03:57:10,430
Something.

5084
03:57:11,030 --> 03:57:11,510
Thirty-five.

5085
03:57:11,570 --> 03:57:11,870
Thirty-six.

5086
03:57:12,090 --> 03:57:13,330
Thirty-seven!

5087
03:57:14,330 --> 03:57:15,610
Thirty-eight!

5088
03:57:16,890 --> 03:57:18,090
Thirty-nine!

5089
03:57:20,610 --> 03:57:21,330
Forty!

5090
03:57:24,530 --> 03:57:26,550
Stop giving me random numbers!

5091
03:57:30,690 --> 03:57:32,050
We're almost halfway there.

5092
03:57:32,490 --> 03:57:33,430
Forty-one!

5093
03:57:33,850 --> 03:57:34,050
Forty-one!

5094
03:57:35,130 --> 03:57:35,910
Forty-two!

5095
03:57:37,210 --> 03:57:38,450
Forty-three!

5096
03:57:39,790 --> 03:57:40,950
Forty-four!

5097
03:57:42,810 --> 03:57:44,490
Forty-five!

5098
03:57:45,450 --> 03:57:46,750
Forty-six!

5099
03:57:47,950 --> 03:57:49,510
Forty-seven!

5100
03:57:51,090 --> 03:57:51,910
Shh!

5101
03:57:51,970 --> 03:57:52,270
Shh!

5102
03:57:52,270 --> 03:57:52,770
Shh!

5103
03:57:52,770 --> 03:57:53,090
Shh!

5104
03:57:53,150 --> 03:57:53,330
Shh!

5105
03:57:53,430 --> 03:57:53,730
Oh!

5106
03:57:53,990 --> 03:57:55,070
I'm sorry.

5107
03:57:57,250 --> 03:57:59,150
Get up, Ryden.

5108
03:58:02,330 --> 03:58:04,230
It's the sound he makes.

5109
03:58:04,370 --> 03:58:05,110
Oh!

5110
03:58:06,570 --> 03:58:08,130
Come on!iß Forty -eight!

5111
03:58:08,330 --> 03:58:08,850
I think!

5112
03:58:09,760 --> 03:58:10,590
Forty-nine!

5113
03:58:12,310 --> 03:58:13,370
Fifty!

5114
03:58:15,130 --> 03:58:16,470
Fifty -one!

5115
03:58:17,550 --> 03:58:18,950
Fifty-two!

5116
03:58:19,830 --> 03:58:21,270
Fifty-three!

5117
03:58:22,370 --> 03:58:24,110
Fifty-four!

5118
03:58:39,850 --> 03:58:42,270
Ryden hanging in mid-air!

5119
03:58:42,850 --> 03:58:43,910
Fifty-five!

5120
03:58:44,670 --> 03:58:46,310
Fifty-six!

5121
03:58:47,070 --> 03:58:48,510
Fifty-seven!

5122
03:58:48,710 --> 03:58:49,250
Fifty-six!

5123
03:58:49,250 --> 03:58:50,730
Fifty-eight.

5124
03:58:52,010 --> 03:58:53,170
Fifty-nine.

5125
03:58:55,710 --> 03:58:56,550
Sixty.

5126
03:58:57,890 --> 03:58:58,830
Sixty-one.

5127
03:58:59,570 --> 03:59:00,410
Nice.

5128
03:59:09,690 --> 03:59:10,370
Sixty-two.

5129
03:59:11,090 --> 03:59:12,330
Come on guys.

5130
03:59:12,430 --> 03:59:13,030
Sixty-three.

5131
03:59:13,050 --> 03:59:13,670
Count with me.

5132
03:59:14,590 --> 03:59:15,750
Sixty-four.

5133
03:59:17,210 --> 03:59:18,470
Sixty-five.

5134
03:59:19,830 --> 03:59:20,870
Sixty-six.

5135
03:59:22,370 --> 03:59:23,770
Sixty-seven.

5136
03:59:25,110 --> 03:59:26,310
Sixty-eight.

5137
03:59:28,130 --> 03:59:31,410
We all know what comes after sixty-eight.

5138
03:59:32,570 --> 03:59:35,110
What comes after sixty-eight everyone?

5139
03:59:37,570 --> 03:59:38,850
Sixty-nine.

5140
03:59:46,190 --> 03:59:47,190
Seventy-two.

5141
03:59:48,090 --> 03:59:49,190
Seventy-three.

5142
03:59:50,410 --> 03:59:51,390
Seventy-four.

5143
03:59:53,350 --> 03:59:54,090
Seventy-five.

5144
03:59:56,410 --> 03:59:57,370
Oh my gosh.

5145
03:59:57,630 --> 03:59:58,750
We're so close.

5146
04:00:05,060 --> 04:00:05,740
Seventy-six.

5147
04:00:06,060 --> 04:00:07,160
You guys, we're so close.

5148
04:00:07,600 --> 04:00:08,500
Seventy-seven.

5149
04:00:09,840 --> 04:00:10,900
Look at this view.

5150
04:00:11,120 --> 04:00:12,020
Seventy-eight.

5151
04:00:13,960 --> 04:00:14,900
Seventy-nine.

5152
04:00:16,280 --> 04:00:16,880
Eighty.

5153
04:00:17,100 --> 04:00:17,920
Twenty more.

5154
04:00:18,900 --> 04:00:19,780
Eighty-one.

5155
04:00:21,560 --> 04:00:22,460
Eighty-two.

5156
04:00:23,480 --> 04:00:26,120
Yeah, lift yourself up bad boy.

5157
04:00:26,280 --> 04:00:27,140
Don't stop.

5158
04:00:28,040 --> 04:00:29,620
You can do it.

5159
04:00:31,180 --> 04:00:32,380
What was I at?

5160
04:00:32,620 --> 04:00:33,540
Eighty-two.

5161
04:00:33,640 --> 04:00:34,560
Eighty-three.

5162
04:00:36,040 --> 04:00:37,060

04:00:40,860 --> 04:00:42,160
Eighty-six.

5165
04:00:43,600 --> 04:00:44,920
Eighty-seven.

5166
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:47,440
Eighty-nine.

5167
04:00:47,440 --> 04:00:47,440
Eighty-eight.

5168
04:00:48,880 --> 04:00:49,860
Eighty-nine.

5169
04:00:49,900 --> 04:00:50,680
Oh my gosh.

5170
04:00:51,220 --> 04:00:52,180
Oh my gosh, wait.

5171
04:00:52,440 --> 04:00:54,200
I was gonna do ninety but...

5172
04:00:54,200 --> 04:00:55,040
Close to it.

5173
04:00:55,800 --> 04:00:57,020
Thanks for the pink.

5174
04:00:57,080 --> 04:00:58,180
Funny number achieved.

5175
04:00:59,920 --> 04:01:00,860
We're so close.

5176
04:01:00,960 --> 04:01:01,380
We're so close.

5177
04:01:01,440 --> 04:01:01,800
We're so close.

5178
04:01:03,240 --> 04:01:03,760
Ninety.

5179
04:01:05,280 --> 04:01:05,960
Ninety-one.

5180
04:01:07,920 --> 04:01:08,800
Ninety-two.

5181
04:01:09,240 --> 04:01:10,320
We're in the home stretch.

5182
04:01:10,680 --> 04:01:11,620
Ninety-three.

5183
04:01:13,340 --> 04:01:14,140
Ninety-four.

5184
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:16,860
Ninety-five.

5185
04:01:18,720 --> 04:01:20,080
Ninety-six.

5186
04:01:20,860 --> 04:01:21,800
So close.

5187
04:01:21,960 --> 04:01:22,140
So close.

5188
04:01:22,220 --> 04:01:22,460
So close.

5189
04:01:22,480 --> 04:01:22,720
So close.

5190
04:01:25,500 --> 04:01:26,620
Four more.

5191
04:01:26,880 --> 04:01:27,520
Four more.

5192
04:01:27,640 --> 04:01:28,260
Four more.

5193
04:01:29,960 --> 04:01:30,640
Four.

5194
04:01:32,540 --> 04:01:33,220
Three.

5195
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:35,840
Two.

5196
04:01:38,020 --> 04:01:38,700
One.

5197
04:01:41,300 --> 04:01:41,980
Yeah?

5198
04:01:44,360 --> 04:01:46,080
Your grip has gotten stronger.

5199
04:01:46,360 --> 04:01:47,940
Guess your hard work has paid off.

5200
04:01:48,220 --> 04:01:48,400
Yippee!

5201
04:01:49,500 --> 04:01:50,820
Jack, you're great.

5202
04:01:52,160 --> 04:01:52,960
Thank you.

5203
04:01:56,400 --> 04:01:56,960
Okay, I'm good.

5204
04:01:58,760 --> 04:02:00,220
This one's for you, Rose.

5205
04:02:07,790 --> 04:02:09,770
So when is the mint workout video?

5206
04:02:12,630 --> 04:02:13,830
Wait, which way should I go?

5207
04:02:13,930 --> 04:02:14,310
Up or down?

5208
04:02:14,310 --> 04:02:14,490
Down.

5209
04:02:15,550 --> 04:02:17,010
I don't even know where this leads.

5210
04:02:17,730 --> 04:02:18,930
Strut F Warehouse.

5211
04:02:18,990 --> 04:02:20,050
Oh, the warehouse!

5212
04:02:27,150 --> 04:02:28,810
I hate this area!

5213
04:02:29,350 --> 04:02:30,190
Wait, no.

5214
04:02:30,210 --> 04:02:31,590
I hate this area more than anything.

5215
04:02:31,870 --> 04:02:32,990
Nothing here.

5216
04:02:35,410 --> 04:02:36,990
Please don't make me go in here.

5217
04:02:37,170 --> 04:02:38,030
Wait a second.

5218
04:02:40,010 --> 04:02:40,530
Please.

5219
04:02:41,230 --> 04:02:42,630
I hate this area.

5220
04:02:43,830 --> 04:02:44,690
There it is!

5221
04:02:45,010 --> 04:02:45,850
We got it!

5222
04:02:46,290 --> 04:02:47,190
We can leave!

5223
04:02:52,560 --> 04:02:54,220
This is the worst strut.

5224
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:55,920
I hate this room.

5225
04:02:56,120 --> 04:02:59,600
I hate this room more than anything in my afterlife.

5226
04:03:05,380 --> 04:03:06,300
Is he coming back?

5227
04:03:06,880 --> 04:03:08,300
Okay, I'm just gonna run for it.

5228
04:03:10,100 --> 04:03:10,940
We can leave.

5229
04:03:13,120 --> 04:03:14,860
I don't think anyone likes this room.

5230
04:03:16,580 --> 04:03:18,060
We'll come back to it.

5231
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:19,580
We at least got what we needed.

5232
04:03:20,000 --> 04:03:21,860
What's on the bottom side though?

5233
04:03:22,040 --> 04:03:22,400
Wait.

5234
04:03:24,800 --> 04:03:25,620
It's still gone.

5235
04:03:25,820 --> 04:03:26,260
Nice.

5236
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:35,160
Is there anything down here that I can get?

5237
04:03:36,580 --> 04:03:37,640
Let's see real quick.

5238
04:03:38,680 --> 04:03:40,160
There's so much loot in that strut.

5239
04:03:40,240 --> 04:03:40,980
I know there is.

5240
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:42,220
I know.

5241
04:03:43,520 --> 04:03:44,400
Nothing here.

5242
04:03:49,830 --> 04:03:50,710
Nothing here.

5243
04:03:50,750 --> 04:03:50,810
Nothing here.

5244
04:03:50,810 --> 04:03:51,110
Oh my God.

5245
04:03:51,150 --> 04:03:52,050
Oh my God.

5246
04:03:52,070 --> 04:03:52,250
Oh my God!

5247
04:03:52,250 --> 04:03:52,330
Oh my God.

5248
04:03:54,770 --> 04:03:55,250
Yep.

5249
04:03:57,550 --> 04:03:58,510
Nothing here.

5250
04:03:59,530 --> 04:04:00,970
Okay, we'll come back.

5251
04:04:01,410 --> 04:04:04,110
Because it probably will be us just fumbling around.

5252
04:04:05,110 --> 04:04:07,390
There was already like a level 3 door.

5253
04:04:07,610 --> 04:04:09,070
I know I wouldn't be able to get into.

5254
04:04:11,250 --> 04:04:12,210
Nothing here.

5255
04:04:17,480 --> 04:04:18,300
Nothing here.

5256
04:04:18,300 --> 04:04:20,700
Nothing here.

5257
04:04:23,060 --> 04:04:23,940
Let's see.

5258
04:04:24,140 --> 04:04:24,260
Oh!

5259
04:04:25,000 --> 04:04:28,420
I just realized I might have to end soon.

5260
04:04:28,860 --> 04:04:30,640
Oh no, I'm not doing this again.

5261
04:04:37,520 --> 04:04:39,860
I think we'll call it...

5262
04:04:40,540 --> 04:04:41,800
in a second.

5263
04:04:47,750 --> 04:04:49,950
Let's get to the next area.

5264
04:04:50,870 --> 04:04:55,310
Because I do have a thing I need to do in an hour.

5265
04:04:59,410 --> 04:05:02,510
Now we can just take these guys out.

5266
04:05:03,050 --> 04:05:03,990
Little baby.

5267
04:05:05,290 --> 04:05:05,970
Goodnight.

5268
04:05:23,200 --> 04:05:25,540
I wish I could throw them overboard.

5269
04:05:26,860 --> 04:05:28,020
Should be able to.

5270
04:05:29,160 --> 04:05:30,340
Nothing here.

5271
04:05:33,680 --> 04:05:34,520
What do you got?

5272
04:05:34,820 --> 04:05:35,340
Anything?

5273
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:36,820
What you got?

5274
04:05:37,760 --> 04:05:39,820
What kind of snacks you have?

5275
04:05:41,300 --> 04:05:41,820
Nothing?

5276
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:43,260
You cheap?

5277
04:05:44,960 --> 04:05:45,480
Cheapo?

5278
04:05:50,120 --> 04:05:51,320
It's been really fun already?

5279
04:05:51,480 --> 04:05:51,720
I'm glad!

5280
04:05:52,560 --> 04:05:54,640
I love this game so much.

5281
04:05:58,100 --> 04:06:00,100
Oh, I wonder if Plissken is still asleep.

5282
04:06:00,980 --> 04:06:02,460
Do these guys have anything?

5283
04:06:02,960 --> 04:06:04,560
Why can't I pick up their stuff?

5284
04:06:04,560 --> 04:06:06,800
Pick up your gun at least.

5285
04:06:08,640 --> 04:06:09,280
Why?

5286
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:10,280
Take it.

5287
04:06:11,120 --> 04:06:12,260
It's free loot.

5288
04:06:16,170 --> 04:06:18,350
What if I put him to sleep even more?

5289
04:06:20,030 --> 04:06:21,950
I think you can shoot that thing.

5290
04:06:25,270 --> 04:06:25,910
Sorry.

5291
04:06:26,570 --> 04:06:27,210
Sorry.

5292
04:06:28,370 --> 04:06:29,010
Sorry.

5293
04:06:32,210 --> 04:06:32,850
Goodnight.

5294
04:06:32,850 --> 04:06:33,050
Goodnight.

5295
04:06:40,850 --> 04:06:41,830
It was...

5296
04:06:41,830 --> 04:06:43,030
It's not even...

5297
04:06:43,410 --> 04:06:44,010
It's a...

5298
04:06:44,570 --> 04:06:44,870
It's...

5299
04:06:44,870 --> 04:06:45,550
You know...

5300
04:06:45,550 --> 04:06:46,330
It's...

5301
04:06:46,330 --> 04:06:46,650
It's...

5302
04:06:46,650 --> 04:06:47,570
It's not even a...

5303
04:06:47,570 --> 04:06:48,690
It was a...

5304
04:06:48,690 --> 04:06:49,270
Always

5305
04:06:53,810 --> 04:06:54,930
ready.

5306
04:06:55,090 --> 04:06:55,890
That's my guy.

5307
04:06:57,470 --> 04:06:59,590
Plissken is just so cool.

5308
04:07:00,570 --> 04:07:01,170
Pliss...

5309
04:07:03,950 --> 04:07:04,870
What's going on out here?

5310
04:07:08,820 --> 04:07:09,420
Snake?

5311
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:10,100
No, no, no.

5312
04:07:10,160 --> 04:07:10,720
That's Plissken.

5313
04:07:11,800 --> 04:07:13,340
I think you're confusing him.

5314
04:07:14,140 --> 04:07:16,040
He's so cool, he's like Snake.

5315
04:07:16,320 --> 04:07:16,880
But that's...

5316
04:07:16,880 --> 04:07:17,840
Oh my god.

5317
04:07:17,940 --> 04:07:18,520
Here it co...

5318
04:07:19,500 --> 04:07:21,720
Ah, I love this fire.

5319
04:07:24,560 --> 04:07:25,000
Fortune.

5320
04:07:25,860 --> 04:07:27,380
Oh my god, she's so cool.

5321
04:07:27,460 --> 04:07:28,060
Watch this, guys.

5322
04:07:28,140 --> 04:07:28,500
Watch this.

5323
04:07:28,680 --> 04:07:30,120
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

5324
04:07:34,480 --> 04:07:34,920
Nothing...

5325
04:07:34,920 --> 04:07:35,980
Nothing hits her.

5326
04:07:36,580 --> 04:07:37,860
Oh my god, the President.

5327
04:07:38,440 --> 04:07:41,820
We're just all shooting so willy nilly at the President.

5328
04:07:41,860 --> 04:07:42,460
Why in there?

5329
04:07:43,180 --> 04:07:44,600
Oh my god, she's so hot.

5330
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:49,590
I love Fortune's theme.

5331
04:07:54,210 --> 04:07:54,650
Whoa!

5332
04:07:54,650 --> 04:07:57,550
It's all just flying around her.

5333
04:08:00,910 --> 04:08:01,790
Oh my god.

5334
04:08:06,950 --> 04:08:08,150
This is impossible!

5335
04:08:08,530 --> 04:08:09,230
Nothing will hit her!

5336
04:08:09,390 --> 04:08:10,670
Is she the one they call Fortune?

5337
04:08:11,490 --> 04:08:12,610
Lady Luck.

5338
04:08:18,030 --> 04:08:20,930
I can't believe they're just like, yeah, we're gonna shoot.

5339
04:08:21,450 --> 04:08:23,790
Even though the President's just lying there.

5340
04:08:26,370 --> 04:08:27,490
Forget Rose.

5341
04:08:27,570 --> 04:08:28,630
This is a lady.

5342
04:08:29,890 --> 04:08:30,510
Queen.

5343
04:08:31,950 --> 04:08:32,570
Queen.

5344
04:08:36,930 --> 04:08:39,390
Mr. President!

5345
04:08:46,330 --> 04:08:47,530
Oh my god.

5346
04:08:47,570 --> 04:08:49,770
Here it comes.

5347
04:08:55,950 --> 04:08:56,790
A dud.

5348
04:08:58,310 --> 04:09:01,320
A dud.

5349
04:09:08,660 --> 04:09:10,040
A dud.

5350
04:09:11,660 --> 04:09:12,740
Uh oh.

5351
04:09:13,700 --> 04:09:16,100
Today is another bad day.

5352
04:09:16,400 --> 04:09:17,360
She's so awesome.

5353
04:09:20,660 --> 04:09:23,960
Is there anyone here that can give me happiness?

5354
04:09:24,260 --> 04:09:25,480
She's so awesome!

5355
04:09:34,890 --> 04:09:35,950
Me, Queen!

5356
04:09:36,330 --> 04:09:36,930
Me!

5357
04:09:37,130 --> 04:09:38,110
I can give you happiness!

5358
04:09:40,410 --> 04:09:41,290
Choose me!

5359
04:09:42,570 --> 04:09:43,830
She's so awesome.

5360
04:09:44,070 --> 04:09:45,590
Oh my god, she's so awesome.

5361
04:09:47,950 --> 04:09:48,730
Oh wow.

5362
04:09:48,730 --> 04:09:48,990
Wow.

5363
04:09:51,410 --> 04:09:52,990
Are you gonna spare him?

5364
04:09:53,670 --> 04:09:54,410
Brother!

5365
04:09:55,670 --> 04:09:56,410
Mufasa!

5366
04:09:57,310 --> 04:09:58,550
Help me, brother!

5367
04:10:08,110 --> 04:10:09,590
Long live...

5368
04:10:09,590 --> 04:10:10,110
No!

5369
04:10:12,680 --> 04:10:14,510
I'm so sorry, my beauties.

5370
04:10:14,730 --> 04:10:16,470
I'll see you again someday.

5371
04:10:32,690 --> 04:10:34,590
She's so cool.

5372
04:10:34,850 --> 04:10:35,330
She's so cool.

5373
04:10:37,550 --> 04:10:38,030
I'll

5374
04:10:41,220 --> 04:10:42,100
see you again someday.

5375
04:10:42,100 --> 04:10:45,080
Colonel, Seal Team 10's Bravo Team was wiped out.

5376
04:10:45,200 --> 04:10:45,920
I see.

5377
04:10:46,240 --> 04:10:47,980
What happened to the cargo choppers?

5378
04:10:48,180 --> 04:10:49,940
Both of them are at the bottom of the harbor.

5379
04:10:50,120 --> 04:10:52,560
Looks like your new hosts have a Harrier, too.

5380
04:10:52,760 --> 04:10:53,600
A Harrier?

5381
04:10:53,840 --> 04:10:54,840
What is this?

5382
04:10:55,020 --> 04:10:55,900
Calm down.

5383
04:10:55,980 --> 04:10:58,280
It just means they anticipated the attack.

5384
04:10:58,600 --> 04:10:59,040
What?

5385
04:10:59,300 --> 04:11:04,160
Besides, since the Seals drew their fire, your infiltration went off without a hitch.

5386
04:11:04,380 --> 04:11:07,180
On top of that, we know their defensive capabilities.

5387
04:11:07,180 --> 04:11:09,940
Are you saying this was all a feint?

5388
04:11:10,160 --> 04:11:11,700
Raiden, get a hold of yourself.

5389
04:11:12,000 --> 04:11:14,280
The entire mission is in your hands now.

5390
04:11:14,440 --> 04:11:15,160
Do you understand?

5391
04:11:15,540 --> 04:11:16,120
No pressure.

5392
04:11:16,480 --> 04:11:17,900
But there's no time for questions.

5393
04:11:18,020 --> 04:11:18,680
A Harrier?

5394
04:11:18,760 --> 04:11:20,740
I hope I don't have to fight that.

5395
04:11:21,240 --> 04:11:22,580
You mean the hostages?

5396
04:11:22,980 --> 04:11:24,880
They could be in danger, yes.

5397
04:11:25,240 --> 04:11:28,720
But we need to consider the possibility that they'll blow the whole shell.

5398
04:11:29,060 --> 04:11:35,620
If that toxic spell does take place, it'll devastate not only the harbor, but poison the coastline for generations.

5399
04:11:35,960 --> 04:11:36,380
Oh my god!

5400
04:11:38,100 --> 04:11:40,760
Raiden, we've had to adjust the mission objectives.

5401
04:11:41,320 --> 04:11:41,840
What's that supposed to mean?

5402
04:11:41,840 --> 04:11:46,140
The priority is now on removing those C4s of the terrorists wired over the big shell.

5403
04:11:46,320 --> 04:11:46,360
I know that.

5404
04:11:46,500 --> 04:11:47,900
The President can wait.

5405
04:11:48,100 --> 04:11:50,060
The President can wait?

5406
04:11:50,120 --> 04:11:52,060
Colonel, you know I'm no bomb disposal expert.

5407
04:11:52,480 --> 04:11:53,600
That's not a problem.

5408
04:11:53,900 --> 04:11:57,160
The Bravo team brought an explosives pro in with them.

5409
04:11:57,200 --> 04:11:57,640
Oh, let's go!

5410
04:11:57,820 --> 04:12:01,380
He was supposed to stand by on Strut C, according to their mission plan.

5411
04:12:01,760 --> 04:12:02,280
What are you talking about?

5412
04:12:02,280 --> 04:12:03,120
You should find him there.

5413
04:12:03,500 --> 04:12:05,500
Is this according to Simulation 2?

5414
04:12:07,240 --> 04:12:08,980
Get to Strut C and find him.

5415
04:12:09,800 --> 04:12:10,240
Understood.

5416
04:12:10,660 --> 04:12:12,780
But I need to ask you something before I go.

5417
04:12:13,000 --> 04:12:14,240
Is this just like my video games?

5418
04:12:14,480 --> 04:12:15,580
Uh, shut the hell up.

5419
04:12:15,640 --> 04:12:19,300
They couldn't hit her no matter how hard they tried.

5420
04:12:19,560 --> 04:12:20,500
Is this like my video game?

5421
04:12:21,060 --> 04:12:21,500
Right.

5422
04:12:22,800 --> 04:12:25,420
It's like being in a nightmare you can't wake up from.

5423
04:12:25,680 --> 04:12:27,080
Jack, snap out of it.

5424
04:12:27,220 --> 04:12:27,660
Rose!

5425
04:12:28,000 --> 04:12:29,740
I can't believe you're on this mission.

5426
04:12:29,880 --> 04:12:31,500
I keep thinking I'll wake up.

5427
04:12:31,920 --> 04:12:33,280
Raiden, this is real.

5428
04:12:33,280 --> 04:12:35,320
And that's why you won't wake up.

5429
04:12:35,400 --> 04:12:36,900
But nothing seems real.

5430
04:12:37,200 --> 04:12:39,140
I've made up my mind to stay with you.

5431
04:12:39,280 --> 04:12:42,940
Whether this is real or a bad dream, I'll keep watching you till it's over.

5432
04:12:43,240 --> 04:12:44,120
Thank you, Rose.

5433
04:12:44,520 --> 04:12:46,940
And I won't let you be just a dream.

5434
04:12:47,640 --> 04:12:48,720
Are you two done?

5435
04:12:49,440 --> 04:12:51,260
Raiden, you're leaving on Strut C.

5436
04:12:51,460 --> 04:12:52,740
Cradle has no...

5437
04:12:53,080 --> 04:12:54,740
Cradle is so no-nonsense.

5438
04:12:55,000 --> 04:12:56,140
He's just like...

5439
04:12:58,660 --> 04:13:02,660
Raiden asks him something and he's just like, What the hell are you talking about, man?

5440
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:06,620
He's like, shut up.

5441
04:13:07,040 --> 04:13:08,000
Shut the hell up.

5442
04:13:08,580 --> 04:13:09,420
Shut up, Raiden.

5443
04:13:09,580 --> 04:13:10,520
Shut the hell up.

5444
04:13:11,760 --> 04:13:13,460
He's already done with Raiden.

5445
04:13:13,560 --> 04:13:14,920
He doesn't even want to deal with him.

5446
04:13:21,120 --> 04:13:22,700
Glad we got to see a dud.

5447
04:13:25,520 --> 04:13:26,240
A dud.

5448
04:13:27,120 --> 04:13:28,800
Colonel's too old for this, it's true.

5449
04:13:28,960 --> 04:13:30,000
No chill, Colonel.

5450
04:13:32,560 --> 04:13:33,720
Oh, I like this place.

5451
04:13:34,100 --> 04:13:35,700
Because that's the bathroom.

5452
04:13:41,010 --> 04:13:42,270
Actually, I don't remember.

5453
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:47,730
Oh, that scared me.

5454
04:13:48,030 --> 04:13:48,970
This auto...

5455
04:13:48,970 --> 04:13:49,830
Oh, yeah!

5456
04:13:51,750 --> 04:13:53,090
Lady Liberty!

5457
04:13:55,790 --> 04:13:58,870
Ho ho ho ho say...

5458
04:13:58,870 --> 04:14:01,730
Can you see?

5459
04:14:03,810 --> 04:14:04,590
USA!

5460
04:14:05,030 --> 04:14:05,490
USA!

5461
04:14:09,090 --> 04:14:10,650
By the do...

5462
04:14:14,330 --> 04:14:16,030
Jack, is that you?

5463
04:14:16,250 --> 04:14:16,790
Yeah.

5464
04:14:18,310 --> 04:14:18,870
Don't...

5465
04:14:20,870 --> 04:14:23,050
They were jorking it in the bathroom.

5466
04:14:24,030 --> 04:14:26,270
And by it, I mean...

5467
04:14:30,340 --> 04:14:31,680
I mean my M9.

5468
04:14:43,730 --> 04:14:47,530
Jack, when you get home, let's have a homecoming party.

5469
04:14:47,710 --> 04:14:48,810
Just the two of us.

5470
04:14:48,810 --> 04:14:50,230
She just raises every...

5471
04:14:50,230 --> 04:14:51,210
That's a good idea.

5472
04:14:51,950 --> 04:14:52,970
I'll make dinner.

5473
04:14:54,670 --> 04:14:55,310
What's wrong?

5474
04:14:55,590 --> 04:14:59,650
Well, that sounds good, but how about we eat out at that one restaurant instead?

5475
04:14:59,650 --> 04:15:00,310
Is Rose's cooking bad?

5476
04:15:00,830 --> 04:15:04,170
You know, the place that we went to recently with the amazing lobster?

5477
04:15:04,610 --> 04:15:06,150
I really like that place.

5478
04:15:06,750 --> 04:15:09,290
Well, yeah, I guess that's okay too.

5479
04:15:10,390 --> 04:15:10,910
Nothing.

5480
04:15:12,090 --> 04:15:13,790
I just love lobster.

5481
04:15:14,050 --> 04:15:15,330
Yeah, can't wait.

5482
04:15:15,490 --> 04:15:15,870
Woo hoo!

5483
04:15:16,190 --> 04:15:16,550
Woo hoo!

5484
04:15:17,050 --> 04:15:18,870
Well, then I'll make a reservation.

5485
04:15:19,530 --> 04:15:21,190
Promise me you'll come back safely.

5486
04:15:21,450 --> 04:15:21,790
Maybe.

5487
04:15:21,810 --> 04:15:22,430
Don't worry.

5488
04:15:24,670 --> 04:15:25,510
Every red flag.

5489
04:15:26,190 --> 04:15:27,830
Every death flag ever.

5490
04:15:30,930 --> 04:15:31,370
Pushkin!

5491
04:15:32,030 --> 04:15:32,790
Pushkin, wake up!

5492
04:15:33,910 --> 04:15:35,110
I almost made a mistake.

5493
04:15:35,250 --> 04:15:35,450
Sorry.

5494
04:15:36,230 --> 04:15:37,950
I wish I was that relaxed.

5495
04:15:38,190 --> 04:15:38,750
Does this turn on?

5496
04:15:39,210 --> 04:15:39,810
It does.

5497
04:15:41,030 --> 04:15:42,650
Look at me, handsome devil.

5498
04:15:43,010 --> 04:15:43,630
Watch this.

5499
04:15:53,970 --> 04:15:54,810
Hold on.

5500
04:15:54,870 --> 04:15:55,150
Watch this.

5501
04:15:55,250 --> 04:15:55,550
Watch this.

5502
04:15:55,610 --> 04:15:55,870
Watch this.

5503
04:15:57,470 --> 04:15:57,790
Oh.

5504
04:15:58,750 --> 04:15:59,070
Oh.

5505
04:15:59,290 --> 04:15:59,610
Uh.

5506
04:16:02,870 --> 04:16:03,730
Damn, I can't.

5507
04:16:04,110 --> 04:16:04,730
Wait, hold on.

5508
04:16:04,750 --> 04:16:05,570
Let me see if I can do it now.

5509
04:16:06,630 --> 04:16:07,690
No, I can only crouch.

5510
04:16:08,110 --> 04:16:08,850
I was gonna try.

5511
04:16:08,930 --> 04:16:09,910
Wait, maybe I could do this.

5512
04:16:11,970 --> 04:16:12,290
No.

5513
04:16:12,470 --> 04:16:12,930
Never mind.

5514
04:16:16,380 --> 04:16:17,200
Wash your hands.

5515
04:16:17,340 --> 04:16:18,220
I didn't go to the bathroom.

5516
04:16:25,430 --> 04:16:27,090
Rose, I'm in the girl's bathroom!

5517
04:16:29,870 --> 04:16:30,970
I'm smelling in here.

5518
04:16:30,970 --> 04:16:32,370
What can I do for you, Jack?

5519
04:16:33,190 --> 04:16:34,410
I'm in the girl's bathroom.

5520
04:16:37,090 --> 04:16:37,410
Shadowboxing?

5521
04:16:39,450 --> 04:16:41,150
I'm shadowboxing in the girl's bathroom!

5522
04:16:41,350 --> 04:16:41,930
What are you gonna do?

5523
04:16:42,150 --> 04:16:43,290
How do you feel about that, Rose?

5524
04:16:43,410 --> 04:16:43,970
How do you feel about that?

5525
04:16:44,030 --> 04:16:44,610
How do you feel about that?

5526
04:16:50,560 --> 04:16:51,900
I can't believe you, Jack.

5527
04:16:51,980 --> 04:16:53,240
Do you know what that place is?

5528
04:16:54,300 --> 04:16:57,800
I just thought maybe the bomb disposal instructor might be in there.

5529
04:16:57,980 --> 04:16:59,260
Why would he be in there?

5530
04:16:59,260 --> 04:17:00,680
Well, you never know.

5531
04:17:00,840 --> 04:17:02,420
He's AWOL, and...

5532
04:17:02,420 --> 04:17:06,080
Even AWOL, a normal guy wouldn't go into a woman's bathroom.

5533
04:17:06,520 --> 04:17:08,520
You're the only one I know who would.

5534
04:17:08,700 --> 04:17:10,300
You're like really strange.

5535
04:17:10,980 --> 04:17:12,340
Rosemary, settle down.

5536
04:17:12,840 --> 04:17:13,820
It's all right.

5537
04:17:14,040 --> 04:17:17,880
You should probably look someplace else.

5538
04:17:18,200 --> 04:17:20,160
I've never heard that one before.

5539
04:17:21,020 --> 04:17:21,440
What's that?

5540
04:17:22,240 --> 04:17:22,880
Nothing.

5541
04:17:23,920 --> 04:17:24,660
That's that.

5542
04:17:24,740 --> 04:17:25,760
Return to your duties.

5543
04:17:26,720 --> 04:17:27,240
You guys are unbelievable.

5544
04:17:27,240 --> 04:17:29,260
That was even the negative reaction, too.

5545
04:17:29,420 --> 04:17:30,600
That was so funny.

5546
04:17:31,120 --> 04:17:32,680
That was the negative reaction.

5547
04:17:32,880 --> 04:17:35,420
Someone said press L2 and R2 while I'm...

5548
04:17:37,700 --> 04:17:39,020
While I'm looking at myself.

5549
04:17:40,560 --> 04:17:41,080
Wow.

5550
04:17:41,620 --> 04:17:43,960
What a stance this guy has.

5551
04:17:49,830 --> 04:17:50,710
You never know.

5552
04:17:50,770 --> 04:17:51,770
See, there's bandages.

5553
04:17:51,990 --> 04:17:52,490
Oh, sorry.

5554
04:17:52,850 --> 04:17:53,930
Pazizamine in here.

5555
04:17:54,350 --> 04:17:56,330
Why is there pazizamine in the bathroom?

5556
04:17:57,750 --> 04:17:58,450
What an idiot.

5557
04:17:58,470 --> 04:17:59,490
What an egotistical woman.

5558
04:17:59,570 --> 04:18:01,230
Oh, I can't wait to hear that line.

5559
04:18:02,130 --> 04:18:03,810
It's my favorite one, you guys.

5560
04:18:04,870 --> 04:18:08,190
I think... See, this is why I consider two my favorite.

5561
04:18:08,310 --> 04:18:10,050
I just am always quoting it.

5562
04:18:10,170 --> 04:18:12,150
I can't stop quoting this.

5563
04:18:12,550 --> 04:18:14,070
This stupid series.

5564
04:18:17,050 --> 04:18:18,830
I can't stop quoting it.

5565
04:18:23,600 --> 04:18:26,700
Hey, Mint.

5566
04:18:26,780 --> 04:18:27,840
You're like really strange.

5567
04:18:28,100 --> 04:18:28,660
Stop.

5568
04:18:30,680 --> 04:18:31,800
MGS2 has good quotes.

5569
04:18:31,860 --> 04:18:32,360
It really does.

5570
04:18:32,900 --> 04:18:34,740
The brain rooms are small.

5571
04:18:35,720 --> 04:18:36,200
Yippee!

5572
04:18:40,420 --> 04:18:40,900
Freeze!

5573
04:18:41,720 --> 04:18:42,500
Don't shoot.

5574
04:18:44,040 --> 04:18:44,920
He's our man!

5575
04:18:46,520 --> 04:18:47,220
I think.

5576
04:18:47,640 --> 04:18:48,120
Probably.

5577
04:18:49,860 --> 04:18:51,220
I'm not NYPD.

5578
04:18:51,400 --> 04:18:53,000
I came in with the Bravo team.

5579
04:18:54,300 --> 04:18:55,240
Who are you with?

5580
04:18:55,360 --> 04:18:56,820
And what happened to SEAL Team 10?

5581
04:18:57,040 --> 04:18:58,580
I have some bad news for you.

5582
04:18:58,640 --> 04:18:58,780
They're all dead.

5583
04:19:00,100 --> 04:19:00,960
All of them?

5584
04:19:01,200 --> 04:19:01,780
All of them?

5585
04:19:01,980 --> 04:19:03,520
They threw a dud.

5586
04:19:04,140 --> 04:19:04,940
You don't understand.

5587
04:19:05,360 --> 04:19:06,500
Did I tell you you could move?

5588
04:19:07,040 --> 04:19:08,160
Oh my god.

5589
04:19:08,320 --> 04:19:09,200
Plissken, you scared me.

5590
04:19:09,220 --> 04:19:09,980
I thought you were napping.

5591
04:19:10,620 --> 04:19:12,700
Don't go pointing that thing everywhere, kid.

5592
04:19:16,380 --> 04:19:17,040
What's your name?

5593
04:19:17,920 --> 04:19:19,020
My name is Peter.

5594
04:19:19,340 --> 04:19:20,840
Peter Stillman!

5595
04:19:23,180 --> 04:19:25,200
Lecturer at Navscolio at Indian Head.

5596
04:19:25,380 --> 04:19:27,620
Also a consultant for the NYPD bomb squad.

5597
04:19:27,620 --> 04:19:31,480
A poor old man who got dragged along for this picnic.

5598
04:19:32,800 --> 04:19:33,320
Peter.

5599
04:19:33,460 --> 04:19:34,680
I thought you'd retired.

5600
04:19:34,900 --> 04:19:35,140
Peter.

5601
04:19:36,580 --> 04:19:37,300
I did.

5602
04:19:37,760 --> 04:19:40,040
Can't keep up with everybody, as you can see.

5603
04:19:40,080 --> 04:19:40,200
Oh my god, Peter.

5604
04:19:40,460 --> 04:19:41,620
Thinking of Hunger Games now.

5605
04:19:41,700 --> 04:19:44,220
A famous church got wiped off the map thanks to me.

5606
04:19:44,380 --> 04:19:45,900
Too many lives inside.

5607
04:19:46,240 --> 04:19:47,900
All I lost was this leg.

5608
04:19:49,220 --> 04:19:50,100
His guilt.

5609
04:19:51,980 --> 04:19:53,760
So you're the bomb disposal guy.

5610
04:19:53,900 --> 04:19:55,340
Raiden, stop.

5611
04:19:56,480 --> 04:19:57,600
Raiden, you are...

5612
04:19:57,620 --> 04:19:59,700
Your sass is off the meter.

5613
04:19:59,840 --> 04:20:00,220
Please.

5614
04:20:00,540 --> 04:20:02,360
Kid, this is the bomb disposal guy.

5615
04:20:02,660 --> 04:20:05,800
Open any explosives disposal textbook and you'll see his name.

5616
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:06,680
This guy's talking about how he's like...

5617
04:20:07,400 --> 04:20:08,580
Just ancient history now.

5618
04:20:08,740 --> 04:20:11,100
Lost his leg and all these people died and he's just like...

5619
04:20:11,100 --> 04:20:12,700
Why did they bring you out of retirement then?

5620
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:15,600
Because the terrorist group here includes one of my students.

5621
04:20:15,620 --> 04:20:16,760
Raiden is serving.

5622
04:20:17,580 --> 04:20:18,060
Fatman!

5623
04:20:18,980 --> 04:20:21,300
He built an atomic bomb when he was only 10.

5624
04:20:21,560 --> 04:20:24,080
I created him in a sense.

5625
04:20:24,540 --> 04:20:25,900
And that's why you're here.

5626
04:20:27,620 --> 04:20:29,340
How did a 10-year-old create an atomic bomb?

5627
04:20:30,280 --> 04:20:33,260
Where didn't a 10-year-old get uranium from?

5628
04:20:33,920 --> 04:20:35,080
I wouldn't say that.

5629
04:20:36,880 --> 04:20:37,340
How?

5630
04:20:38,360 --> 04:20:39,780
Where did he get it?

5631
04:20:42,260 --> 04:20:45,960
There are at least two people here who can claim to be experts at bomb disposal.

5632
04:20:46,000 --> 04:20:47,140
He made it out of Legos.

5633
04:20:47,460 --> 04:20:48,920
Are you two with SEAL Team 10?

5634
04:20:49,400 --> 04:20:49,860
Yeah!

5635
04:20:52,960 --> 04:20:54,500
We're with another squad.

5636
04:20:54,500 --> 04:20:56,720
My name is Plissken, Lieutenant Junior Grade.

5637
04:20:56,980 --> 04:20:57,920
Honored to meet you, sir.

5638
04:20:58,200 --> 04:21:01,340
Mr. Plissken, do you have any experience with explosives disposal?

5639
04:21:01,760 --> 04:21:02,620
Don't worry about me.

5640
04:21:02,740 --> 04:21:04,600
And he looks young, but he can do it.

5641
04:21:04,640 --> 04:21:05,780
But we need more manpower.

5642
04:21:05,900 --> 04:21:06,260
I'm...

5643
04:21:07,560 --> 04:21:08,320
What's your name?

5644
04:21:10,160 --> 04:21:10,600
Raiden.

5645
04:21:11,480 --> 04:21:12,400
That's an odd name.

5646
04:21:13,200 --> 04:21:14,400
Why does everybody say that?

5647
04:21:14,860 --> 04:21:16,660
There was also an engineer with me.

5648
04:21:17,940 --> 04:21:18,800
An engineer?

5649
04:21:21,660 --> 04:21:22,540
An engineer?

5650
04:21:22,540 --> 04:21:24,100
A skinny guy.

5651
04:21:24,300 --> 04:21:25,260
He went in with us.

5652
04:21:25,280 --> 04:21:25,800
Not a fat man.

5653
04:21:26,020 --> 04:21:26,600
Skinny guy.

5654
04:21:26,760 --> 04:21:27,080
Where is he?

5655
04:21:27,400 --> 04:21:28,900
I haven't seen him since that skirmish.

5656
04:21:29,020 --> 04:21:29,700
Was he killed?

5657
04:21:29,940 --> 04:21:30,700
I don't think so.

5658
04:21:30,840 --> 04:21:31,860
I didn't find his body.

5659
04:21:32,120 --> 04:21:32,500
I see.

5660
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:35,980
They told me he was a security systems architect for the Big Shell.

5661
04:21:36,280 --> 04:21:37,840
Why would they take a civilian along?

5662
04:21:38,320 --> 04:21:40,420
Everything in this structure is computer controlled.

5663
04:21:40,600 --> 04:21:43,020
He was supposed to get us past all the security measures.

5664
04:21:43,640 --> 04:21:45,160
I never heard anything about that.

5665
04:21:45,580 --> 04:21:47,120
He had official orders with him.

5666
04:21:48,700 --> 04:21:49,920
We'll leave that for later.

5667
04:21:52,940 --> 04:21:53,880
Who could it be?

5668
04:21:54,100 --> 04:21:56,160
But there's no one left from the CO's EOD squad.

5669
04:21:56,500 --> 04:21:56,860
Yup.

5670
04:21:56,980 --> 04:21:58,220
So we have to do it ourselves.

5671
04:21:58,220 --> 04:21:59,060
Fat man versus skinny guy.

5672
04:21:59,060 --> 04:22:00,500
But I've never defused a bomb before.

5673
04:22:00,780 --> 04:22:01,880
Hold on a sec.

5674
04:22:02,080 --> 04:22:03,840
Off to confer with the CO again.

5675
04:22:04,300 --> 04:22:04,740
Hey.

5676
04:22:06,440 --> 04:22:06,920
Um...

5677
04:22:07,860 --> 04:22:08,340
Yeah.

5678
04:22:08,880 --> 04:22:09,480
I'm a...

5679
04:22:09,480 --> 04:22:11,360
Glad to hear Stillman is safe.

5680
04:22:11,660 --> 04:22:13,060
I'm a dog of the governor.

5681
04:22:15,220 --> 04:22:18,080
Colonel, you know I've never been trained in bomb disposal.

5682
04:22:18,600 --> 04:22:19,420
It's all right.

5683
04:22:19,620 --> 04:22:22,240
The man you're working with is the best in the field.

5684
04:22:22,540 --> 04:22:22,960
What the heck do you think you are?

5685
04:22:22,960 --> 04:22:24,840
All you have to do is follow his directions.

5686
04:22:25,180 --> 04:22:28,740
You will, of course, keep your identity and mission objectives to yourself.

5687
04:22:29,240 --> 04:22:31,840
Is it true that an engineer came in with Stillman?

5688
04:22:31,980 --> 04:22:34,000
Why does Raiden, like, go off the screen?

5689
04:22:34,080 --> 04:22:34,200
I wasn't informed of that.

5690
04:22:34,200 --> 04:22:36,260
It's probably something the SEALs decided on their own.

5691
04:22:36,580 --> 04:22:37,000
Hmm.

5692
04:22:37,640 --> 04:22:40,020
There are more important issues at hand right now.

5693
04:22:40,500 --> 04:22:42,720
The enemy may retaliate for the failed assault.

5694
04:22:42,760 --> 04:22:43,440
What the heck do you think you are?

5695
04:22:43,520 --> 04:22:45,560
Get those C4s neutralized now.

5696
04:22:45,740 --> 04:22:46,220
Okay.

5697
04:22:46,340 --> 04:22:48,940
Colonel, I'm not qualified for bomb disposal.

5698
04:22:48,940 --> 04:22:50,580
Jack, it's me.

5699
04:22:50,800 --> 04:22:51,300
Rose?

5700
04:22:51,640 --> 04:22:52,780
You can do this.

5701
04:22:52,780 --> 04:22:53,600
Trust me.

5702
04:22:53,740 --> 04:22:57,000
You haven't had bomb disposal training per se in VR.

5703
04:22:57,340 --> 04:23:00,060
But you're more than capable of handling C4.

5704
04:23:00,400 --> 04:23:02,880
This is a little different from using C4.

5705
04:23:03,140 --> 04:23:04,200
You're up for this.

5706
04:23:04,320 --> 04:23:05,140
You know that.

5707
04:23:05,440 --> 04:23:06,480
How about it, kid?

5708
04:23:06,720 --> 04:23:08,000
Are the results in yet?

5709
04:23:10,640 --> 04:23:12,180
Plissken infiltrating my thoughts.

5710
04:23:12,680 --> 04:23:14,340
300 video games, by the way.

5711
04:23:14,460 --> 04:23:15,680
There's no need to think about this so much.

5712
04:23:15,680 --> 04:23:17,060
Yeah, you'd think that they would give him something.

5713
04:23:17,080 --> 04:23:18,280
You won't actually be dismantling the bomb.

5714
04:23:18,320 --> 04:23:19,640
That's not for amateurs.

5715
04:23:19,920 --> 04:23:23,020
What we'll try here instead is a temporary freezing measure.

5716
04:23:23,400 --> 04:23:24,760
Here, look at this.

5717
04:23:26,620 --> 04:23:27,060
Okay.

5718
04:23:27,140 --> 04:23:27,780
I'm looking.

5719
04:23:29,780 --> 04:23:30,220
Okay.

5720
04:23:31,680 --> 04:23:33,080
Could you move it any slower?

5721
04:23:33,280 --> 04:23:34,460
This is a C4 bomb.

5722
04:23:34,580 --> 04:23:35,460
Please move it slower.

5723
04:23:38,620 --> 04:23:39,260
I'm scared.

5724
04:23:40,180 --> 04:23:40,760
It's live.

5725
04:23:41,160 --> 04:23:42,460
You can see it pulsing.

5726
04:23:42,540 --> 04:23:42,780
Yeah.

5727
04:23:45,680 --> 04:23:46,180
There we go.

5728
04:23:46,600 --> 04:23:47,240
Simple, huh?

5729
04:23:47,440 --> 04:23:49,580
The spray freezes the detonator instantly.

5730
04:23:49,880 --> 04:23:51,660
How long does the effect last?

5731
04:23:52,040 --> 04:23:54,500
There's no way the thing can detonate in this condition.

5732
04:23:54,680 --> 04:23:54,940
Nice.

5733
04:23:54,960 --> 04:23:58,200
Even if you leave it alone, it'll stay out of commission for at least 24 hours.

5734
04:23:58,400 --> 04:23:58,700
Okay.

5735
04:23:58,700 --> 04:23:59,380
That's enough time.

5736
04:23:59,480 --> 04:24:00,200
That is enough time.

5737
04:24:00,300 --> 04:24:02,720
If we had the manpower, I'd recommend complete disposal.

5738
04:24:03,220 --> 04:24:03,700
Instantly.

5739
04:24:03,700 --> 04:24:04,420
I know, right?

5740
04:24:05,200 --> 04:24:07,140
Instantly is a bit of a stretch.

5741
04:24:07,380 --> 04:24:11,000
Check the floor, ceiling, walls, under a table, everywhere.

5742
04:24:11,340 --> 04:24:13,900
Try to imagine the locations the bomb will choose.

5743
04:24:14,340 --> 04:24:15,420
That won't be easy.

5744
04:24:15,680 --> 04:24:17,140
We don't know a thing about Fat Man.

5745
04:24:17,420 --> 04:24:19,600
Is there anything that'll help us locate the bombs?

5746
04:24:19,600 --> 04:24:20,260
I love Fat Man.

5747
04:24:20,680 --> 04:24:22,320
We know one thing.

5748
04:24:22,400 --> 04:24:23,580
We know two things.

5749
04:24:24,180 --> 04:24:24,980
He's a Fat Man.

5750
04:24:25,340 --> 04:24:28,920
It can recognize ionized gas emitted by C4s.

5751
04:24:28,920 --> 04:24:29,900
Ooh, all stinky.

5752
04:24:30,180 --> 04:24:34,100
In other words, that little gadget sniffs out C4's scent.

5753
04:24:34,700 --> 04:24:35,400
That's right.

5754
04:24:35,720 --> 04:24:38,200
I've established a link up with your radar network.

5755
04:24:38,440 --> 04:24:39,680
Miss loves Fat Man?

5756
04:24:39,800 --> 04:24:40,860
I love Fat Man!

5757
04:24:41,360 --> 04:24:43,960
Have the sensor activated and keep your eye on the radar.

5758
04:24:43,960 --> 04:24:44,840
I really like Fat Man.

5759
04:24:45,680 --> 04:24:47,180
He's using some other odorless substance.

5760
04:24:48,080 --> 04:24:49,260
He's so awesome.

5761
04:24:50,420 --> 04:24:51,000
Sniffle, sniffle.

5762
04:24:51,000 --> 04:24:52,040
I know Fat Man well.

5763
04:24:52,680 --> 04:24:55,500
I know how into his own aesthetics he is.

5764
04:24:56,600 --> 04:24:57,120
Signatures?

5765
04:24:57,420 --> 04:24:57,880
Yes.

5766
04:24:57,980 --> 04:25:02,280
On every bomb he builds, he always leaves a trace of the cologne he uses.

5767
04:25:02,520 --> 04:25:03,560
Fat Man!

5768
04:25:03,600 --> 04:25:05,780
The sensor also picks up that particular scent spectrum.

5769
04:25:07,380 --> 04:25:09,360
Is that something he learned from you?

5770
04:25:09,900 --> 04:25:11,860
No, it was his own quirk.

5771
04:25:11,980 --> 04:25:13,880
He's just quirky like that.

5772
04:25:13,980 --> 04:25:14,500
He wouldn't work by any rules except his own.

5773
04:25:15,680 --> 04:25:16,400
I used to treat him like a religion.

5774
04:25:16,760 --> 04:25:19,240
And common sense wasn't one of his strong points.

5775
04:25:20,100 --> 04:25:22,100
I thought I taught him everything I knew.

5776
04:25:22,780 --> 04:25:24,560
I have no children of my own.

5777
04:25:24,660 --> 04:25:26,460
And I thought I found a son in him.

5778
04:25:27,120 --> 04:25:28,660
He had the right stuff, you know.

5779
04:25:29,460 --> 04:25:32,780
There's something very unusual about an ability like that.

5780
04:25:33,320 --> 04:25:35,720
Even at Indian Head he got special treatment.

5781
04:25:36,020 --> 04:25:36,280
Yeah, the porch is real good.

5782
04:25:36,280 --> 04:25:36,700
So awesome.

5783
04:25:36,760 --> 04:25:39,200
I remember some people called him one of the fat cats.

5784
04:25:39,980 --> 04:25:41,680
Maybe that's what started all this.

5785
04:25:42,340 --> 04:25:43,760
I didn't teach him the most important thing I had to tell him.

5786
04:25:43,760 --> 04:25:44,900
He's not a cat, I'm a Mario.

5787
04:25:44,900 --> 04:25:47,520
There are some things you have to pass on.

5788
04:25:47,860 --> 04:25:49,580
The trick is to know which one.

5789
04:25:50,280 --> 04:25:50,720
Right.

5790
04:25:51,260 --> 04:25:52,860
All I taught him was skills.

5791
04:25:53,000 --> 04:25:56,360
I don't know if you should teach anybody skills on how to make a box.

5792
04:25:56,400 --> 04:25:57,220
And now I have to stop him from using it to destroy us all.

5793
04:25:58,320 --> 04:26:00,840
I wonder if, you know...

5794
04:26:00,840 --> 04:26:01,680
Oh my god, watermelon.

5795
04:26:01,680 --> 04:26:03,520
Let's see how well that sensor works.

5796
04:26:03,660 --> 04:26:04,240
I want some watermelon.

5797
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:07,840
I'm activating him.

5798
04:26:07,900 --> 04:26:08,300
Watch.

5799
04:26:08,500 --> 04:26:08,800
Okay.

5800
04:26:09,380 --> 04:26:11,160
You see the green stuff on the radar?

5801
04:26:11,380 --> 04:26:11,460
Whoa!

5802
04:26:11,460 --> 04:26:15,420
That's a visual representation of the C4 scent detected by the sensor.

5803
04:26:15,680 --> 04:26:17,320
It's a pretty big area, isn't it?

5804
04:26:17,440 --> 04:26:18,240
Don't complain.

5805
04:26:18,540 --> 04:26:19,700
It's better than nothing.

5806
04:26:19,980 --> 04:26:21,760
Just activate the sensors.

5807
04:26:21,820 --> 04:26:23,560
How can we not smell it?

5808
04:26:23,660 --> 04:26:25,140
Why don't we just use our nose?

5809
04:26:25,640 --> 04:26:28,620
I think Batman and Running Man would have cooperated a little bit.

5810
04:26:28,880 --> 04:26:30,820
I think so.

5811
04:26:31,180 --> 04:26:33,320
We have to keep out of the enemy's sight, too.

5812
04:26:33,540 --> 04:26:36,660
Because the radar gets knocked offline when we're spotted.

5813
04:26:36,800 --> 04:26:38,480
Batman is against Running Man.

5814
04:26:39,060 --> 04:26:39,620
Exactly.

5815
04:26:41,040 --> 04:26:42,000
Batman skates.

5816
04:26:42,740 --> 04:26:43,520
It's too cool.

5817
04:26:48,920 --> 04:26:49,820
Smell-O-Vision.

5818
04:26:50,780 --> 04:26:52,740
I know the structure of this facility.

5819
04:26:52,980 --> 04:26:55,520
And if he wants to take out the plant, where he would target?

5820
04:26:56,480 --> 04:26:57,680
You know this for sure?

5821
04:26:57,940 --> 04:26:58,300
Of course.

5822
04:26:59,260 --> 04:27:01,180
I taught him the techniques he uses.

5823
04:27:02,080 --> 04:27:04,220
His ideas are based on my theories.

5824
04:27:04,580 --> 04:27:05,000
No.

5825
04:27:05,100 --> 04:27:06,400
Demolition is a kind of ideology.

5826
04:27:06,660 --> 04:27:08,400
It makes no exceptions for time or place.

5827
04:27:08,580 --> 04:27:08,640
Your student went rogue!

5828
04:27:09,940 --> 04:27:10,420
Stolen!

5829
04:27:10,440 --> 04:27:10,760
Stolen!

5830
04:27:24,300 --> 04:27:25,960
Is that the flag?

5831
04:27:26,960 --> 04:27:28,700
Is that the Sons of Liberty flag?

5832
04:27:31,080 --> 04:27:32,780
Is that the Sons of Liberty flag?

5833
04:27:44,620 --> 04:27:45,780
Hmm... okay.

5834
04:27:46,580 --> 04:27:47,700
Where'd they put the half-pipes?

5835
04:27:48,060 --> 04:27:48,460
Yeah!

5836
04:27:54,060 --> 04:27:59,280
What are you giving me?

5837
04:28:00,180 --> 04:28:00,960
What is it?

5838
04:28:04,320 --> 04:28:04,720
Level...

5839
04:28:05,620 --> 04:28:06,020
One!

5840
04:28:09,620 --> 04:28:12,020
I like the idea of using hints to find the bombs.

5841
04:28:12,140 --> 04:28:13,440
It's like a game of Hot Cold Men.

5842
04:28:14,300 --> 04:28:16,800
Oh, I hate that room.

5843
04:28:17,800 --> 04:28:18,340
No...

5844
04:28:20,540 --> 04:28:21,080
No...

5845
04:28:24,600 --> 04:28:26,160
No... I don't wanna go in there.

5846
04:28:27,360 --> 04:28:28,760
This is messed up!

5847
04:28:31,100 --> 04:28:32,960
Why can't I... why... why...

5848
04:28:43,580 --> 04:28:43,920
Damn.

5849
04:28:46,120 --> 04:28:46,960
Plissken is better.

5850
04:28:47,160 --> 04:28:47,540
You're right.

5851
04:28:48,860 --> 04:28:49,540
You're right.

5852
04:28:50,100 --> 04:28:51,780
I don't even know why I'm trying to compare.

5853
04:28:53,980 --> 04:28:54,620
Hey, hey, hey.

5854
04:28:54,660 --> 04:28:55,580
Where do you think you're going, mister?

5855
04:28:55,780 --> 04:28:56,120
Yeah.

5856
04:28:57,380 --> 04:28:58,100
Uh, no, sir.

5857
04:29:00,360 --> 04:29:00,700
Yeah.

5858
04:29:03,680 --> 04:29:04,020
Ooh.

5859
04:29:04,020 --> 04:29:05,040
You don't have to be so honest.

5860
04:29:06,360 --> 04:29:10,100
Just, uh, hide in the fridge.

5861
04:29:10,300 --> 04:29:12,020
Why don't you just let us handle the grunt work?

5862
04:29:12,020 --> 04:29:15,060
You can tell us what to do over the radio like in the original mission plan.

5863
04:29:16,540 --> 04:29:17,220
All right.

5864
04:29:17,800 --> 04:29:18,580
All right.

5865
04:29:19,160 --> 04:29:20,760
I'll give you instructions from here.

5866
04:29:20,880 --> 04:29:23,820
I may also need to prepare a backup plan just in case.

5867
04:29:24,140 --> 04:29:25,160
In case of what?

5868
04:29:26,040 --> 04:29:27,400
Good luck to both of you.

5869
04:29:27,520 --> 04:29:28,580
This is a dangerous one.

5870
04:29:28,580 --> 04:29:30,100
Go out the exit from the kitchen.

5871
04:29:30,160 --> 04:29:31,040
You'll see a cess box.

5872
04:29:31,320 --> 04:29:31,420
Who dares, wins.

5873
04:29:31,780 --> 04:29:32,340
Oh, okay.

5874
04:29:32,420 --> 04:29:32,620
I'll check.

5875
04:29:34,200 --> 04:29:36,080
If anything comes up, let me know.

5876
04:29:36,240 --> 04:29:36,680
Okay.

5877
04:29:36,760 --> 04:29:39,380
My frequency is 140.25.

5878
04:29:39,800 --> 04:29:40,480
140.25.

5879
04:29:40,480 --> 04:29:40,980
Good luck, kid.

5880
04:29:41,080 --> 04:29:42,000
I'll see you later.

5881
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:42,740
Hihihi.

5882
04:29:43,980 --> 04:29:44,500
Hihihi.

5883
04:29:44,560 --> 04:29:44,600
Hihihi.

5884
04:29:44,600 --> 04:29:45,040
Semper Fi.

5885
04:29:46,320 --> 04:29:47,020
Semper Fi.

5886
04:29:49,380 --> 04:29:50,900
That man's no SEAL.

5887
04:29:51,060 --> 04:29:51,660
Semper Fi.

5888
04:29:52,400 --> 04:29:54,340
I don't even think he's a Navy man.

5889
04:29:54,520 --> 04:29:54,660
Huh?

5890
04:29:54,960 --> 04:29:55,480
Oh.

5891
04:29:56,340 --> 04:29:57,120
He's sussy.

5892
04:29:57,120 --> 04:29:57,620
Semper Fi.

5893
04:29:59,520 --> 04:30:00,280
Semper Fi.

5894
04:30:00,420 --> 04:30:01,220
Marine Corps talk.

5895
04:30:01,560 --> 04:30:01,900
Ooh.

5896
04:30:04,260 --> 04:30:05,020
Semper Fi.

5897
04:30:05,780 --> 04:30:07,560
Why did he even think to say that?

5898
04:30:07,580 --> 04:30:10,600
Normally, team leaders stay in the CP and give orders with those headphones.

5899
04:30:12,040 --> 04:30:15,380
And as far as I know, SEALs keep their officers away from the field.

5900
04:30:15,520 --> 04:30:15,600
Act natural.

5901
04:30:15,600 --> 04:30:16,020
Semper Fi.

5902
04:30:17,700 --> 04:30:21,180
And who dares, wins is a model of the British Special Air Service.

5903
04:30:21,220 --> 04:30:21,300
Plissken walking away being like, nailed it.

5904
04:30:26,540 --> 04:30:27,100
Nailed it.

5905
04:30:27,180 --> 04:30:28,420
Is he one of the terrorists, then?

5906
04:30:28,540 --> 04:30:29,100
They don't suspect a thing.

5907
04:30:29,100 --> 04:30:30,240
Somehow, I don't think so.

5908
04:30:30,440 --> 04:30:33,560
If there's someone to suspect, I'd put my money on you.

5909
04:30:33,720 --> 04:30:33,920
Hey!

5910
04:30:34,060 --> 04:30:35,240
What do you mean by that?

5911
04:30:35,700 --> 04:30:36,700
Is it because I'm...

5912
04:30:37,620 --> 04:30:39,000
Is it because I'm so beautiful?

5913
04:30:41,460 --> 04:30:41,860
No.

5914
04:30:41,860 --> 04:30:41,980
Somehow, I don't think so.

5915
04:30:41,980 --> 04:30:43,600
I'm... riding.

5916
04:30:44,180 --> 04:30:45,880
Just take care of those bombs for now.

5917
04:30:46,120 --> 04:30:46,440
Okay.

5918
04:30:48,160 --> 04:30:48,980
What about you?

5919
04:30:49,080 --> 04:30:50,620
They could be back in this area soon.

5920
04:30:53,780 --> 04:30:54,920
You hide in there.

5921
04:30:56,400 --> 04:30:58,360
I'll hide out in this pantry for a while.

5922
04:30:59,180 --> 04:30:59,580
Yeah.

5923
04:30:59,980 --> 04:31:01,720
If I lock the door, it should be alright.

5924
04:31:02,060 --> 04:31:02,460
Yeah.

5925
04:31:02,800 --> 04:31:05,360
Plenty of food in here too, so you don't need to worry about me.

5926
04:31:05,600 --> 04:31:06,360
But a bathroom.

5927
04:31:06,380 --> 04:31:08,480
I'll give you instructions by Kodak from here.

5928
04:31:08,720 --> 04:31:09,940
Do you need to go potty first?

5929
04:31:10,560 --> 04:31:10,960
Yeah.

5930
04:31:11,980 --> 04:31:12,660
Good luck, kid.

5931
04:31:13,900 --> 04:31:14,300
Hi.

5932
04:31:14,860 --> 04:31:15,000
Oh.

5933
04:31:16,300 --> 04:31:18,920
Bomb disposal is a face-off with your own mortality.

5934
04:31:19,180 --> 04:31:20,900
Don't let the fear get to you.

5935
04:31:21,700 --> 04:31:24,620
When you give in to the fear, the darkness comes.

5936
04:31:24,880 --> 04:31:25,080
Why would it have a lock?

5937
04:31:25,420 --> 04:31:25,820
Because...

5938
04:31:26,940 --> 04:31:29,840
Well, actually, it's weird why it would have a lock on the inside.

5939
04:31:30,360 --> 04:31:33,820
Having a lock on the outside makes sense, because you don't want people getting into the pantry.

5940
04:31:34,380 --> 04:31:36,180
But why would it have one on the inside?

5941
04:31:37,280 --> 04:31:37,680
Hmm.

5942
04:31:38,580 --> 04:31:38,980
Strange.

5943
04:31:39,640 --> 04:31:40,040
I don't know.

5944
04:31:41,560 --> 04:31:41,960
I don't know.

5945
04:31:41,960 --> 04:31:42,420
Okay.

5946
04:31:43,140 --> 04:31:43,580
Nice.

5947
04:31:44,200 --> 04:31:44,320
So...

5948
04:31:45,480 --> 04:31:46,660
Pluskin went this way, right?

5949
04:31:52,400 --> 04:31:53,320
Did he go this way?

5950
04:31:54,940 --> 04:31:56,300
So the food doesn't get out?

5951
04:31:56,420 --> 04:31:56,520
Oh.

5952
04:32:00,500 --> 04:32:01,920
So you aren't locked in.

5953
04:32:02,760 --> 04:32:06,260
But then people can just unlock it from the...

5954
04:32:06,260 --> 04:32:06,960
Oh.

5955
04:32:06,980 --> 04:32:07,340
Oh!

5956
04:32:14,760 --> 04:32:15,200
Ah!

5957
04:32:30,800 --> 04:32:31,660
What is this?

5958
04:32:32,500 --> 04:32:32,940
What is this?

5959
04:32:32,940 --> 04:32:34,840
What is this?

5960
04:32:35,420 --> 04:32:36,340
Column?

5961
04:32:37,480 --> 04:32:38,400
Plissken!

5962
04:32:46,500 --> 04:32:49,340
Yeah, he told us all about this!

5963
04:32:52,180 --> 04:32:56,140
No way, it's part of his box?!

5964
04:32:56,140 --> 04:32:59,820
No way!

5965
04:33:05,520 --> 04:33:06,720
I'm sorry!

5966
04:33:07,020 --> 04:33:08,460
No, the orange!

5967
04:33:10,260 --> 04:33:13,520
I can't believe he's just like...

5968
04:33:13,520 --> 04:33:16,240
Just pocket the longest of all.

5969
04:33:16,440 --> 04:33:25,820
I know, he literally told us all about it.

5970
04:33:26,200 --> 04:33:27,920
Plissken, I just saw someone with a box!

5971
04:33:32,940 --> 04:33:34,220
I just saw a box!

5972
04:33:35,000 --> 04:33:38,020
A man in a box running away!

5973
04:33:43,760 --> 04:33:44,560
Yeah.

5974
04:33:50,220 --> 04:33:51,020
Delta?

5975
04:33:56,720 --> 04:33:57,520
Yeah.

5976
04:33:57,980 --> 04:33:58,340
No.

5977
04:33:58,600 --> 04:34:03,020
They got weird when Colonel Jackson, Fortune's husband, was sent to jail.

5978
04:34:03,180 --> 04:34:04,100
Sent to jail?

5979
04:34:04,360 --> 04:34:05,060
For what?

5980
04:34:05,360 --> 04:34:05,880
Corruption.

5981
04:34:06,100 --> 04:34:08,120
He misappropriated government funds.

5982
04:34:08,460 --> 04:34:09,960
Sounds like he deserved it.

5983
04:34:10,100 --> 04:34:11,560
That's what everybody else thought.

5984
04:34:11,760 --> 04:34:13,520
Except for the members of Dead Cell.

5985
04:34:13,800 --> 04:34:15,940
They felt the Colonel was falsely accused.

5986
04:34:16,460 --> 04:34:19,520
Fact is, they took the case to the powers that be.

5987
04:34:19,760 --> 04:34:21,900
But they never managed to reopen the case.

5988
04:34:22,160 --> 04:34:23,700
Was there any truth to their claim?

5989
04:34:23,940 --> 04:34:24,720
Who knows?

5990
04:34:24,780 --> 04:34:28,220
Whatever the situation is, Dead Cell's name was tainted.

5991
04:34:28,460 --> 04:34:29,360
And Colonel Jackson?

5992
04:34:29,700 --> 04:34:31,300
He was being held at Leavenworth.

5993
04:34:31,300 --> 04:34:31,560
Was?

5994
04:34:32,380 --> 04:34:33,600
Meaning he's been released?

5995
04:34:33,980 --> 04:34:37,100
Well, in a manner of speaking, the Colonel's dead.

5996
04:34:38,200 --> 04:34:41,440
Apparently, he lost the will to live and died in prison.

5997
04:34:41,700 --> 04:34:44,840
The members of Dead Cell snapped with the loss of their leader.

5998
04:34:44,860 --> 04:34:47,960
They underwent a radical change and became uncontrollable.

5999
04:34:48,060 --> 04:34:51,200
And that's why they undertook this terrorist operation.

6000
04:34:51,800 --> 04:34:53,360
Seems as good a reason as any.

6001
04:35:00,330 --> 04:35:02,470
Vamp is a member of Dead Cell.

6002
04:35:02,770 --> 04:35:05,330
Born in Romania, his specialty is knives.

6003
04:35:05,550 --> 04:35:07,250
But I guess you know that by now.

6004
04:35:07,630 --> 04:35:12,850
When he was just a kid, he lost his family to a terrorist bomb that went off in a church they were attending.

6005
04:35:13,350 --> 04:35:20,010
His body pierced by a crucifix, Vamp was buried under the rubble for two days before he was finally rescued.

6006
04:35:20,430 --> 04:35:25,590
During those two days, he survived by feeding on the blood of his family to quench his thirst.

6007
04:35:25,790 --> 04:35:28,110
That was how he acquired a taste for blood.

6008
04:35:28,690 --> 04:35:30,790
So that's why they call him Vamp.

6009
04:35:31,050 --> 04:35:32,990
No, Vamp isn't for vampire.

6010
04:35:33,030 --> 04:35:34,370
It's because he's bisexual.

6011
04:35:35,550 --> 04:35:41,550
Rumor has it, Vamp was the lover of Scott Dolph, the Marine Commandant who accidentally died two years ago.

6012
04:35:41,930 --> 04:35:45,890
Scott Dolph was also the father of Fortune, the Dead Cell leader.

6013
04:35:46,530 --> 04:35:47,510
Fortune's old man?

6014
04:35:47,790 --> 04:35:49,230
But Fortune and Vamp?

6015
04:35:49,470 --> 04:35:50,670
You noticed, eh?

6016
04:35:50,730 --> 04:35:52,290
Not bad for a rookie.

6017
04:35:53,530 --> 04:35:57,110
As you say, Vamp and Fortune are very close.

6018
04:35:57,370 --> 04:35:59,750
Not lovers, but very close.

6019
04:36:00,170 --> 04:36:00,730
Friends?

6020
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:03,930
No, there's more to their relationship than that.

6021
04:36:04,290 --> 04:36:04,890
It's true.

6022
04:36:04,890 --> 04:36:06,010
Vamp was her father's lover.

6023
04:36:06,210 --> 04:36:08,590
Would it have been better if it was with her mother?

6024
04:36:08,890 --> 04:36:12,310
Well, I don't really think they care what you think.

6025
04:36:12,570 --> 04:36:13,650
Focus on the mission.

6026
04:36:13,950 --> 04:36:16,210
I just don't understand the correlation.

6027
04:36:16,230 --> 04:36:18,150
By the way, have you ever met the guy before?

6028
04:36:18,350 --> 04:36:19,190
I don't understand the correlation.

6029
04:36:19,330 --> 04:36:25,110
I don't know why he's so matter-of-factly and is just like, uh, no.

6030
04:36:25,590 --> 04:36:26,510
It's because he's bi.

6031
04:36:26,910 --> 04:36:29,810
I told you, the Dead Cell is a group of madmen.

6032
04:36:29,950 --> 04:36:32,430
I wouldn't take anything they say very seriously.

6033
04:36:32,450 --> 04:36:33,250
And are you a vampire?

6034
04:36:35,470 --> 04:36:35,950
Maybe.

6035
04:36:36,170 --> 04:36:38,450
Maybe I'm more vampire than ghost than I thought.

6036
04:36:40,030 --> 04:36:42,150
What do you know about that strange woman?

6037
04:36:42,430 --> 04:36:43,370
You mean Fortune?

6038
04:36:43,790 --> 04:36:45,290
She's the Dead Cell leader.

6039
04:36:45,350 --> 04:36:45,690
Oh, come on!

6040
04:36:45,690 --> 04:36:46,330
I want the box!

6041
04:36:46,770 --> 04:36:48,690
I think we missed the box codec.

6042
04:36:48,690 --> 04:36:49,170
That's so sad.

6043
04:36:49,170 --> 04:36:50,710
...known to her friends as Lady Luck.

6044
04:36:50,910 --> 04:36:51,790
Lady Luck?

6045
04:36:52,010 --> 04:36:52,490
Yeah.

6046
04:36:52,750 --> 04:36:56,190
She got the name because bullets seemed to veer away from her in battle.

6047
04:36:57,330 --> 04:37:02,590
People have heard her say that her fortune in battle was payback for the lousy luck she's had in life.

6048
04:37:03,070 --> 04:37:03,630
Lousy luck?

6049
04:37:03,630 --> 04:37:06,050
The death of her father, the Marine Commander.

6050
04:37:06,390 --> 04:37:08,390
The conviction of husband and Dead Cell leader, Colonel Jackson.

6051
04:37:08,390 --> 04:37:08,610
It's okay, we'll get through these.

6052
04:37:08,830 --> 04:37:09,890
I like listening to them anyway.

6053
04:37:10,170 --> 04:37:17,830
These events were followed by her mother's suicide, the loss of a husband, and the idea of a convict in the family apparently took her over the edge.

6054
04:37:18,030 --> 04:37:19,190
Lady Luck, but she's not very lucky.

6055
04:37:19,190 --> 04:37:23,890
Fortune was three months pregnant at the time, and the shock of her mother's death led to the loss of her child.

6056
04:37:24,030 --> 04:37:24,450
Oh my god!

6057
04:37:24,590 --> 04:37:27,590
Add to this her husband's death in prison a few months later and...

6058
04:37:27,590 --> 04:37:33,610
To sum it up, in the six months after her father's death, she lost her family and everything that mattered to her.

6059
04:37:35,110 --> 04:37:36,610
Jeez, she's had it rough.

6060
04:37:36,970 --> 04:37:37,310
Yeah.

6061
04:37:37,670 --> 04:37:40,030
The thing is, she didn't grieve long.

6062
04:37:40,470 --> 04:37:42,390
Instead, she joined the military.

6063
04:37:42,830 --> 04:37:43,690
Now why is that?

6064
04:37:43,850 --> 04:37:44,450
Revenge, baby.

6065
04:37:44,450 --> 04:37:45,070
Do I look psychic?

6066
04:37:45,470 --> 04:37:47,010
My best guess is revenge.

6067
04:37:47,210 --> 04:37:47,490
Yeah.

6068
04:37:47,590 --> 04:37:49,630
I heard that she firmly believed that her husband was framed.

6069
04:37:49,630 --> 04:37:50,490
Do I look psychic?

6070
04:37:50,850 --> 04:37:51,950
Plissken is so sassy.

6071
04:37:51,950 --> 04:37:58,590
Anyway, by the time she came out of basic training, she'd proven many times over that she was gifted with an unusual streak of luck.

6072
04:37:58,690 --> 04:38:00,050
Oh my god, sassy Plissken.

6073
04:38:00,050 --> 04:38:01,970
In fact, some say she sold her soul for it.

6074
04:38:02,210 --> 04:38:02,870
Her soul?

6075
04:38:02,870 --> 04:38:09,390
Her uncanny luck earned her a reputation that led to her appointment as the head of her husband's unit, Dead Cell.

6076
04:38:10,230 --> 04:38:10,710
Hmm...

6077
04:38:12,170 --> 04:38:14,030
What else do you have to say to us, Plissken?

6078
04:38:14,370 --> 04:38:15,010
Fat man.

6079
04:38:15,350 --> 04:38:15,650
Yeah!

6080
04:38:15,870 --> 04:38:20,490
Supposedly, he's nicknamed after an atomic bomb, but to me, he's just a fat man.

6081
04:38:20,910 --> 04:38:22,710
Something straight out of a sideshow.

6082
04:38:23,110 --> 04:38:28,830
If he even has a bit of spare time, he spends it disassembling and assembling his Glock over and over again.

6083
04:38:28,910 --> 04:38:29,670
What are you trying to say, Plissken?

6084
04:38:29,670 --> 04:38:31,090
He can't stand to have his hands still.

6085
04:38:31,650 --> 04:38:36,910
He's extremely vain about his hands, keeps his fingers as slender and soft as a woman's.

6086
04:38:36,970 --> 04:38:37,130
Wow!

6087
04:38:37,330 --> 04:38:40,570
They say he's always looking at his hands, giving himself manicures.

6088
04:38:41,670 --> 04:38:44,070
Fat man is so eccentric, I love him.

6089
04:38:46,670 --> 04:38:50,150
Plissken, I saw someone wearing a cardboard box just now.

6090
04:38:50,390 --> 04:38:51,170
A box?

6091
04:38:51,450 --> 04:38:52,890
I don't know anything about that.

6092
04:38:53,250 --> 04:38:54,730
You sure you weren't imagining things?

6093
04:38:55,030 --> 04:38:56,050
Of course I'm sure.

6094
04:38:56,330 --> 04:38:58,270
Do you think it's one of the members of Dead Cell?

6095
04:38:58,470 --> 04:38:59,470
How should I know?

6096
04:38:59,710 --> 04:39:01,070
I don't want to fight someone like that.

6097
04:39:01,070 --> 04:39:02,130
Why not?

6098
04:39:02,430 --> 04:39:03,690
Because it looks so dumb.

6099
04:39:03,870 --> 04:39:07,010
Anyone who's willing to be seen like that must be completely insane.

6100
04:39:07,290 --> 04:39:08,590
What the- I mean, he's a psycho.

6101
04:39:08,710 --> 04:39:09,830
There's no question about it.

6102
04:39:10,130 --> 04:39:10,310
Oh.

6103
04:39:11,150 --> 04:39:11,630
Yeah.

6104
04:39:24,450 --> 04:39:26,550
Plissken, what do you know about Stillman?

6105
04:39:26,790 --> 04:39:28,350
He's a bomb disposal expert.

6106
04:39:28,610 --> 04:39:30,150
Probably the best in the world.

6107
04:39:30,150 --> 04:39:30,910
What else?

6108
04:39:31,130 --> 04:39:31,870
What do you mean?

6109
04:39:32,190 --> 04:39:33,350
Like, why he retired.

6110
04:39:33,410 --> 04:39:33,830
Yeah.

6111
04:39:33,830 --> 04:39:34,810
Are you here to gossip?

6112
04:39:34,930 --> 04:39:35,370
No.

6113
04:39:35,570 --> 04:39:38,550
Then get back to work defusing those C4s.

6114
04:39:38,550 --> 04:39:38,850
Okay.

6115
04:39:38,850 --> 04:39:41,710
If there's something you need to know about Stillman, go ask him yourself.

6116
04:39:41,910 --> 04:39:44,970
What was Stillman's 140-the-25?

6117
04:39:50,600 --> 04:39:52,320
Are you here to gossip?

6118
04:39:53,780 --> 04:39:54,260
Yeah.

6119
04:39:54,260 --> 04:39:57,320
It appears that Fat Man placed bombs within each of the struts.

6120
04:39:57,460 --> 04:40:00,240
It's likely there are no bombs planted on the connecting bridges.

6121
04:40:00,480 --> 04:40:00,660
Now we have another thing.

6122
04:40:00,660 --> 04:40:03,280
Head for the struts for which you have not yet finished exploring.

6123
04:40:03,280 --> 04:40:04,260
I got 6-9.

6124
04:40:04,260 --> 04:40:04,420
6-9.

6125
04:40:04,420 --> 04:40:05,140
That's 6-9.

6126
04:40:05,700 --> 04:40:06,000
6-9.

6127
04:40:06,640 --> 04:40:07,200
6-9.

6128
04:40:07,540 --> 04:40:08,040
Aw.

6129
04:40:08,280 --> 04:40:09,800
The little piece of the box!

6130
04:40:09,880 --> 04:40:11,740
I'm sorry, Plissken!

6131
04:40:11,860 --> 04:40:12,280
I'm sorry!

6132
04:40:12,440 --> 04:40:13,500
I broke your box!

6133
04:40:13,980 --> 04:40:14,120
Oh.

6134
04:40:14,580 --> 04:40:15,140
Okay.

6135
04:40:15,240 --> 04:40:16,000
This guy is...

6136
04:40:16,000 --> 04:40:16,640
Oh, shit.

6137
04:40:16,840 --> 04:40:17,160
Um.

6138
04:40:17,280 --> 04:40:17,820
Um.

6139
04:40:17,980 --> 04:40:18,460
Um.

6140
04:40:18,760 --> 04:40:19,020
Um.

6141
04:40:20,940 --> 04:40:21,500
Oh

6142
04:40:29,390 --> 04:40:30,170
my God.

6143
04:40:33,410 --> 04:40:34,390
That was close.

6144
04:40:35,030 --> 04:40:36,490
That was too close.

6145
04:40:37,850 --> 04:40:39,230
Let's go back inside.

6146
04:40:42,250 --> 04:40:44,210
That was way too close.

6147
04:40:44,450 --> 04:40:45,310
That was way too close.

6148
04:40:45,370 --> 04:40:45,950
That was way too close.

6149
04:40:45,990 --> 04:40:48,230
How nice of that guard to wave through your whole codec call.

6150
04:40:50,990 --> 04:40:52,390
Is there anybody in here?

6151
04:40:54,530 --> 04:40:55,530
Can we go around?

6152
04:40:56,150 --> 04:40:57,570
Oh, I can go through here now, right?

6153
04:40:57,650 --> 04:40:57,970
Yeah.

6154
04:41:05,580 --> 04:41:05,980
Okay.

6155
04:41:09,150 --> 04:41:11,170
Because I gotta go, you guys.

6156
04:41:12,990 --> 04:41:13,950
I've got to go.

6157
04:41:14,830 --> 04:41:16,250
Jack, do you need to save?

6158
04:41:16,350 --> 04:41:16,590
I do!

6159
04:41:20,290 --> 04:41:23,650
And we got all the codec stuff, so I should save that.

6160
04:41:28,070 --> 04:41:28,470
Yay!

6161
04:41:31,470 --> 04:41:32,210
Hang in there.

6162
04:41:33,670 --> 04:41:34,150
That's it?

6163
04:41:35,190 --> 04:41:36,310
That's all you gotta tell me, Rose?

6164
04:41:37,130 --> 04:41:37,250
That's all?

6165
04:41:37,870 --> 04:41:38,310
That's it?

6166
04:41:38,970 --> 04:41:39,970
That's all you gotta tell me?

6167
04:41:40,850 --> 04:41:41,510
Nothing else?

6168
04:41:43,030 --> 04:41:43,390
Okay.

6169
04:41:44,150 --> 04:41:44,510
Sure.

6170
04:41:45,530 --> 04:41:45,890
Sure.

6171
04:41:46,450 --> 04:41:48,850
Before you go, did you work out the Eternal Darkness save issue?

6172
04:41:48,990 --> 04:41:49,450
I did!

6173
04:41:49,770 --> 04:41:50,950
I did, I did, I did.

6174
04:41:51,530 --> 04:41:51,890
Yeah.

6175
04:41:53,690 --> 04:41:54,490
Thank you, thank you.

6176
04:41:54,830 --> 04:41:55,150
Chu.

6177
04:41:55,690 --> 04:41:56,050
Chu!

6178
04:41:56,390 --> 04:41:57,170
Marilyn, thank you!

6179
04:41:57,250 --> 04:41:58,310
Thanks for another MGS Saturday.

6180
04:41:58,450 --> 04:42:00,570
Just letting you know that you have gotten so much better at being sneaky.

6181
04:42:01,730 --> 04:42:02,090
Really?

6182
04:42:03,290 --> 04:42:03,890
You think so?

6183
04:42:06,410 --> 04:42:07,050
Thank you!

6184
04:42:09,490 --> 04:42:11,570
I'm still scared for the rest of the game.

6185
04:42:12,170 --> 04:42:13,710
Do you remember what day it is tomorrow?

6186
04:42:15,650 --> 04:42:16,550
I don't know.

6187
04:42:17,810 --> 04:42:19,070
I'm just a silly guy.

6188
04:42:20,150 --> 04:42:21,370
I'm just a silly guy.

6189
04:42:22,050 --> 04:42:22,750
I don't know.

6190
04:42:22,750 --> 04:42:23,090
I don't know.

6191
04:42:23,110 --> 04:42:24,210
Bomb disposal?

6192
04:42:25,390 --> 04:42:25,830
Diffusion?

6193
04:42:26,370 --> 04:42:27,110
I don't know.

6194
04:42:27,450 --> 04:42:28,230
I don't know.

6195
04:42:29,350 --> 04:42:31,810
I don't know what day it is tomorrow.

6196
04:42:32,130 --> 04:42:32,790
I don't know anything.

6197
04:42:32,790 --> 04:42:33,910
I'm silly.

6198
04:42:35,010 --> 04:42:36,110
I'm just a silly guy.

6199
04:42:37,130 --> 04:42:42,870
For the next time I play this, I believe I will be playing it on Thursday.

6200
04:42:43,390 --> 04:42:43,870
Thursday.

6201
04:42:44,910 --> 04:42:48,890
Because I will be busy on next Saturday.

6202
04:42:49,030 --> 04:42:50,030
So I'm sorry.

6203
04:42:50,290 --> 04:42:51,350
Because I feel bad.

6204
04:42:52,450 --> 04:42:54,610
The previous Metal Gear was...

6205
04:42:54,610 --> 04:42:57,830
When I finished Metal Gear Solid 1, it was on a weekday.

6206
04:42:57,870 --> 04:42:58,610
It wasn't a Saturday.

6207
04:42:58,770 --> 04:43:01,190
And the next one will not be a Saturday either.

6208
04:43:01,530 --> 04:43:02,590
In fact, I think...

6209
04:43:02,590 --> 04:43:08,970
I think, honestly, my next couple of Saturdays are going to be kind of busy.

6210
04:43:09,150 --> 04:43:10,070
So I thought...

6211
04:43:10,070 --> 04:43:11,150
I even considered.

6212
04:43:11,210 --> 04:43:11,910
I was like...

6213
04:43:11,910 --> 04:43:12,430
Hmm...

6214
04:43:13,310 --> 04:43:14,370
Maybe I should...

6215
04:43:15,490 --> 04:43:20,570
Maybe I shouldn't start Metal Gear until my weekends are a little less busy.

6216
04:43:20,990 --> 04:43:24,890
But we'll still have Metal Gear at some point.

6217
04:43:26,010 --> 04:43:26,770
Deja vu.

6218
04:43:26,850 --> 04:43:28,870
I've just been in this place before.

6219
04:43:30,950 --> 04:43:31,510
So...

6220
04:43:31,510 --> 04:43:32,270
Yeah.

6221
04:43:33,150 --> 04:43:33,670
But...

6222
04:43:33,670 --> 04:43:36,310
So next Thursday, we'll be playing more Metal Gear.

6223
04:43:37,050 --> 04:43:37,570
Spike!

6224
04:43:37,870 --> 04:43:39,090
Thank you for the 20k!

6225
04:43:39,170 --> 04:43:39,790
Thank you!

6226
04:43:43,750 --> 04:43:44,270
And...

6227
04:43:44,830 --> 04:43:45,350
Yeah.

6228
04:43:45,450 --> 04:43:45,890
So...

6229
04:43:45,890 --> 04:43:49,810
My weekends coming up for the next couple of weeks are like kind of insane.

6230
04:43:50,130 --> 04:43:51,070
Kind of crazy.

6231
04:43:52,350 --> 04:43:52,870
But...

6232
04:43:52,870 --> 04:43:55,850
If I can, maybe I can make Metal Gear Sundays.

6233
04:43:57,530 --> 04:43:59,210
If I can't do Saturday.

6234
04:43:59,450 --> 04:44:01,490
I know some Sundays I can't do Saturday.

6235
04:44:01,490 --> 04:44:02,450
I can't even do...

6236
04:44:02,950 --> 04:44:03,970
It's kind of complicated.

6237
04:44:04,950 --> 04:44:05,330
But...

6238
04:44:06,010 --> 04:44:06,770
Mint Frenchman.

6239
04:44:09,770 --> 04:44:10,710
Hope for good reason.

6240
04:44:10,810 --> 04:44:10,950
Yeah!

6241
04:44:11,250 --> 04:44:12,230
It's just like...

6242
04:44:13,770 --> 04:44:15,810
Not next weekend, but the weekend after.

6243
04:44:15,930 --> 04:44:17,210
I'll be guesting at a convention.

6244
04:44:18,410 --> 04:44:19,130
In Texas!

6245
04:44:21,090 --> 04:44:23,910
I'll be seeing the Did You Know Gaming videos on Metal Gear games.

6246
04:44:24,010 --> 04:44:25,190
They got David Hayter to voice them too.

6247
04:44:25,230 --> 04:44:26,110
I have seen them!

6248
04:44:26,270 --> 04:44:26,470
Yeah!

6249
04:44:27,230 --> 04:44:27,810
I have.

6250
04:44:27,830 --> 04:44:28,050
I have.

6251
04:44:30,650 --> 04:44:31,470
MGS2 is always super cool.

6252
04:44:31,470 --> 04:44:32,130
Super comfy somehow.

6253
04:44:32,390 --> 04:44:32,670
Really?

6254
04:44:32,830 --> 04:44:33,250
You think so?

6255
04:44:33,370 --> 04:44:35,010
I think it's the most stressful game in the world.

6256
04:44:37,390 --> 04:44:37,870
Wow.

6257
04:44:39,530 --> 04:44:40,010
Comfy.

6258
04:44:41,330 --> 04:44:41,810
Yeah.

6259
04:44:43,550 --> 04:44:44,030
Yeah.

6260
04:44:44,530 --> 04:44:45,530
Where in Texas?

6261
04:44:47,270 --> 04:44:47,930
I'm sorry.

6262
04:44:48,070 --> 04:44:49,090
I don't have the information.

6263
04:44:49,350 --> 04:44:51,170
It's called Anime Fest, I believe.

6264
04:44:52,050 --> 04:44:52,530
So...

6265
04:44:54,050 --> 04:44:54,730
But yeah.

6266
04:44:54,810 --> 04:44:55,690
Don't work too hard.

6267
04:44:55,770 --> 04:44:56,430
Thank you.

6268
04:44:56,550 --> 04:44:56,950
Thank you.

6269
04:44:56,970 --> 04:44:57,290
Thank you.

6270
04:44:57,650 --> 04:44:58,130
Arlington?

6271
04:44:58,430 --> 04:44:59,290
Is it in Arlington?

6272
04:45:00,310 --> 04:45:01,450
Maybe Arlington, Texas.

6273
04:45:03,330 --> 04:45:03,770
Yeah.

6274
04:45:04,150 --> 04:45:04,310
Yeah.

6275
04:45:05,110 --> 04:45:05,550
So...

6276
04:45:05,550 --> 04:45:06,010
Hmm.

6277
04:45:06,370 --> 04:45:11,410
I do have some stuff that I need to take care of for next weekend.

6278
04:45:11,710 --> 04:45:12,150
Actually.

6279
04:45:13,050 --> 04:45:14,430
That I'm taking care of soon.

6280

Tonight.

6281
04:45:15,310 --> 04:45:15,750
So...

6282
04:45:16,250 --> 04:45:16,690
Yeah.

6283
04:45:17,770 --> 04:45:18,750
Excited for Anime Fest.

6284
04:45:18,830 --> 04:45:19,750
It's so close to my house.

6285
04:45:19,870 --> 04:45:20,530
Oh my god!

6286
04:45:20,690 --> 04:45:21,530
I'll see you there!

6287
04:45:23,670 --> 04:45:26,150
I hear this George Sears guy is pretty neat.

6288
04:45:26,230 --> 04:45:27,130
He is...

6289
04:45:29,110 --> 04:45:29,550
Solidus.

6290
04:45:29,550 --> 04:45:30,090
Welcome back.

6291
04:45:30,210 --> 04:45:30,630
Oh my gosh.

6292
04:45:31,470 --> 04:45:31,610
George Sears?

6293
04:45:32,230 --> 04:45:33,090
He's like the...

6294
04:45:33,090 --> 04:45:34,470
He's my president.

6295
04:45:34,890 --> 04:45:36,570
That's the best president.

6296
04:45:36,690 --> 04:45:37,390
I love that guy.

6297
04:45:37,770 --> 04:45:38,270
But yeah.

6298
04:45:38,310 --> 04:45:38,930
Thank you for...

6299
04:45:38,930 --> 04:45:40,610

We will continue next week.

6303
04:45:47,090 --> 04:45:49,450
And we'll get all into the fun stuff.

6304
04:45:50,210 --> 04:45:51,110
It's just...

6305
04:45:51,110 --> 04:45:52,290
It's just all beginning.

6306
04:45:52,450 --> 04:45:55,210
All the cool craziness is just starting.

6307
04:45:55,350 --> 04:45:55,790
So...

6308
04:45:55,790 --> 04:45:56,490

I'll try and get a waiting room up tonight.

6316
04:46:09,570 --> 04:46:11,510
I'm not quite sure what I'm doing...

6317
04:46:11,510 --> 04:46:14,290
I think I have two streams tomorrow actually.

6318
